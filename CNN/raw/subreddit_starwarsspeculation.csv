Billions of people dying very soon are not enough to focus on your one child that will be responsible?! Are you insane?. He didnt tell her Hey I found our daughter did he? No he told her about a girl. That could be anything especially considering that Han knows many girls and even has a second wife.. It doesnt matter what I believe. It matters what we are discussing.. Takes one to know one? Yes Rey was tempted and she actively and consciously rejected the dark side.

Kylo ordered the search for the droid to be dropped because she had the memory. Hux flat out called him out on this to Snoke he would have found out some way or another. It sounded like he knew Kylo had her and was searching for the memory.The problem was that Kylo who had  problems getting memories from other people couldnt get to what he needed. He specifically states almost begging Snoke All I need is your guidance. Hes trying to remain in control of who is keeping Rey. The whole scene with them and especially pointed out in the novel Kylo was being incredibly gentle with her. Ill go as gently as I can. I take no joy in this however much you may think otherwise. Stories of people using this force ability have caused massive harm including lifelong coma. Im sure he knows how much this ability could fuck someone up. Snoke probably does this without hesitation and why Kylo sort of freaks out. He knows Snoke wont hesitate to hurt her. I was sort of curious to see how he would respond if he had brought Rey to him.

6162346,0,t1_cypmi5b,. Can you provde source for the JJ quote related to Boyegas and Ridleys accents?. Yes she may have acquired her accent prior to being left on Jakku but I find that hard to believe. The reason is language acquisition is best at . Since she has spent the most important years in language development entirely immersed on an alien to her planet with multiple languages and dialects as well as accents it is unlikely that her original language would not be affected. So there are only few scenarios that would account for her accent. The actress felt most comfortable speaking in her native accentThe character was raised primarily by someone with the same accent on Jakku the most likely candidate is Lor.She was raised by someone who has since died but who had a similar accent. . Why would Obi Wan be talking to her via The Force for  years and not say Anakin? Or even Yoda? And And how many of these conversations do you think it takes to acquire an accent?Im not trying to be rude or anything. It is just that I have had this same exact debate countless times now and I am getting a bit annoyed with it  not you  but this same exact debate. If you want to speculate that she is a Kenobi and use evidence to support it that is fine.

6227709,0,t1_cyu7mmy,Except of course it was the attachment of father and son that ultimately destroyed the Empire and the Sith. In ROTJ there were two ways that the Empire could have won either convert Luke to the dark side or kill him.If Luke had killed his father he would have gone over to the dark side and the Empire would have won. It did not happen because of Lukes attachment to his father. If the Emperor had been successful in killing Luke the Empire would have again won. Except this didnt happen because of Anakins attachment to his son. So you see attachment which is the same thing as love is what saved the last Jedi destroyed the Sith and brought balance to the force. With the prequels I think we were meant to realize that the Jedi themselves were also flawed. There absolutism with regards to attachment among other things led to their downfall. In fact in the OT both Obiwan and Yoda tell Luke that he has to destroy Vader if he is to win and Luke rebukes them. If Luke had followed Obiwans and Yodas advice against attachment the Emperor would have won. It was precisely because he went against their advice that the Emperor lost. So ultimately the lesson that Luke learns at the end of ROTJ is that the Jedi code could have used some modifications. So saying that Luke wouldnt follow the rules on attachment when attachment saved the galaxy is in fact the logical thing. It would be regressing if Luke once again embraced the no attachment rule of the old Jedi order.,starwarsspeculation,cyxiu7e,1,t5_3a3kv

Adding another major character this late would spread out the trilogys focus too much.Im starting to lean back towards the idea Rey was at the academy at the time of the attack. Kylo was taking Rey to present to Snoke who we know was keenly interested in collecting Skywalkers but couldnt bring himself to do it perhaps they had grown close?. He dropped her off on Jakku which was the last stop before FO territory Jakku is apparently a jump point into the unknown regions for the FO. Hes been wrestling with his guilt on the one hand and his perceived weakness on the other ever since and has done his best to bury any memory of her.Right now Reys feelings toward Kylo are pretty one dimensional  pure hatred  which isnt particularly interesting.

Rey Luke   Why Luke Skywalker of all people? Whats her connection to him? She can use the force but so can Maz so why would she think Luke could be one to fulfill her need of her family coming back to her? If you think shes Hans kid why wouldnt he be mentioned here?

Leia seems to know her know of her or her force sense let her in on something because the first time they meet she strolls right past Chewie ya know her husbands best friend and a really good friend to her shes known for over  years and right over to Rey. That scene really doesnt look like a long lost daughter and mother reunion. That and the fact she sends her off to Luke for who knows how long very shortly after meeting her is pretty reasonable speculation they are not mother and daughter.  .

6291435,0,t3_41rhof,I like where your head is at but let me adjust this a bit to get it more in line with something Disney can sell.Nature versus nurture.In Episode VIII it will be revealed that Rey is the adopted daughter of Luke. He had a daughter once and lost her. Her mother fell to the dark side and took her when she left Luke. He pursued them and their attempts to flee caused them to crash.Luke was distraught and when he found Rey he adopted her. Shed never be HIS daughter but it allowed him to pursue his new dream of being a father. But when the Jedi Temple is attacked by his vengeful presumably for the death of their daughter exwife Luke and Rey are separated. Luke is forced to flee and begs Kylo Ren to protect his daughter.Thats all Luke can recall. But in an Episode IX twist Rey discovers the truth her mother recognized her after that battle and took her to Jakku. She planned to come back for her but was killed by Snoke before she could for failing to kill Luke. The implication is that Snoke was her master and Kylo Ren was converted by her.Therefore the theme is still about the importance of family and has a nature versus nurture type theme as well. ,starwarsspeculation,cz4rkef,1,t5_3a3kv

When Lucas wrote that in RotS Im not sure that anyone had the final episodes of Clone Wars in mind even him especially with the way Yoda says it in the movie versus what we actually see him do in TCW. Point being that the TCW writers fell in love with the Mortis storyline and decided that the Force ghost stuff could use a bit more attention while also giving them a chance to do a bigger Yoda storyline. This was actually really poorly thought out and just dug the hole around the whole force ghost thing even deeper as it now raises the question of how Anakin ever figured it out. As is even taking the canon in whole the purpose of the Yodas trials were to force him to confront his denial of the dark side as being an aspect of himself.

It was the last time Luke had it and Han is really surprised to see it again. Also Kylo Ren looks to really want it that weapon is mine! so I dont think he would have let it go. I dont know how Maz came in its possession but I dont think its the way you imagine.I think you missed one important thing in the context of Reys vision. Rey wasnt atttracted to Anakins lightsaber as soon as they landed on the planet or were in the castle. Its only after Finn left Rey that she hears a girl crying and screaming in fact her younger self and follow it to the saber.Reys main issue was that she was abandonned on Jakku by her family or what she think is her family. Finn leaving her so abruptly may have been reminiscent of it. If shes Lukes daughter then being drawn to the lightsaber by the Force while in this emotional state makes sense.When she touches the saber and has a vision I dont think its the weapon that show her its story but more the Force give her a quick review of the events most of it in the past and a bit of the future  how Luke lost the saber when he decided to go in exile maybe leaving the map with R standing next to him Kylo Ren and his clique more or less what she is destined to fight and while many thinks he saved her from the guy he kills I think they dont realises she isnt physically there during these events herself left on Jakku which may be linked or may not be linked to Kylo Ren then her future confrontation with Kylo Ren on Starkiller. If Ren still has his mask on in her vision well always in motion is the future.The same as you I dont think Kylo Ren Han or Leia have a clear idea of who Rey is. And I dont think either Luke Han or Kylo left her on Jakku I think it may be her mother however.Leia has good reasons to send her after all Han and Finn hold her in high esteem she helped bringing BB back and destroying Starkiller shes Forcesensitive and after claiming the lightsaber I think shes resolute to become a Jedi.

6520123,0,t1_czsd5kq,Firstly Im in the Rey is Lukes daughter camp mainly because its the easiest way to explain half of what happens in TFA regarding Rey her powers the musical and visual themes linking her to Luke in the OT. Not only that but continuing the skywalker family for further franchises the episodes are a skywalker story and I dont think theyll do episodes without them if they do then it definitely wont be this trilogy. I dont think theyll do an ESB style reveal to finally tell us I have confidence that theyll handle it well Im expecting them to address it pretty early in  maybe even opening crawl and give more insight into her mother and what happened to her in Regarding your points maybe Luke hasnt left Achto because he learned a lesson after the time he rushed off hastily in a rescue attempt? When making a decision to leave degobah Luke asks if he must sacrifice Han and Leia to finish his training.... If you honour what they fight for yesOf course its possible that he doesnt know shes alive and thats why he hasnt come to get her. I cant read that much into the look on Lukes face definitely sorrow maybe some shame and regret. Daisys face looks a little confused at first and then pure emotion. Personally I think its something like THIS is Luke? But that face is so familiar... Dad?As for Mazs lines theyre pretty ambiguous and after seeing the movie quite a few times the interpretation I get is that Rey was left by one parent who cant come back mother but if she goes forward she can find the other Luke.MazWhomever youre waiting for on jakku theyre never coming back. But theres someone who still could. ReyLuke...MazThe belonging you seek is not behind you it is ahead.All very ambiguous language whomever they someone etc. ,starwarsspeculation,cztqcr0,1,t5_3a3kv

6608706,0,t3_466pqp,Oh wow good find! This is canon I presume?gtAs she peered into the distance she saw a man in black wielding a red Lightsaber. His face was covered with a mask molded to approximate a human face. But the masks eyes were dead and empty. The mans red Lightsaber clashed against a brilliant beam of blue. A young man with blond hair raised his own Lightsaber and fought furiously against the monster in black.So thats just a rephrasing of the battle she saw on Bespin right?  Just more specifically describing the two battling with lightsabers as Luke and Darth Vader this time.  Ive been pondering if all of Reys vision was necessarily in the past.  This has probably been touched on but isnt it possible that at least part of Reys vision was a look into her future.  Maybe we actually are watching a tiny clip of Episode VIII.  Maybe its Benicio getting killed which begs the question of why.  ,starwarsspeculation,d02w9wq,5,t5_3a3kv

6658014,0,t3_46s91a,The main reason I love this theory so much is that its equal to how much I hope its not true. But isnt that what each and every one of us deep down truly loves about Star Wars? Star Wars is never what we want it to be its what we need it to be. My six year old self was PISSED when Vader told Luke what I had to wait an additional  of my entire life to find out for sure if it was indeed true. What Im loving right now about being a lifelong fan of Star Wars is we dont know what is in store. Anything can be for that was the cause of the ill fated prequels. George Lucas gave us a glimpse into the idealized galaxy that these heroes have been fighting to restore even though it was a losing battle to show it to us. No matter how cool the storytelling or acting would have been the ending would have been just as much of a downer. NOOOOOOO! Yes. Its true.

6813685,0,t1_d0okcpw,Her being a Kenobi has a massive pay off because of the implications it presents. We already have our Skywalker  Ben. YES hes technically a Solo but hes a former Jedi that turned to the dark side because issues  Skywalker. I think itd be familiar but still refreshing to see the Skywalker bloodline continue to cause unrest in the galaxy to the point where everyone is pretty much coming to the conclusion that Yknow what fuck the Skywalkers and even Luke sees this. Through a revelation that Anakin was indeed created by Snoke Luke is left with the dilemma of Are we doomed to fail or do I challenge our destiny as a family and reject what has been planned for us? or Do I sever all ties and destroy my family including myself for the good of the galaxy? whilst Rey Kenobi is the catalyst along with her father  ObiWan. They were their to counteract the Skywalker threat. That sounds like a perfectly good plot to me that isnt too complicated. It shows a real moral dilemma one that isnt as simple as Light or Dark. Ben could also play a role in this grey area as Abrams and Kasdan hinted at. ,starwarsspeculation,d0ommxt,1,t5_3a3kv

7020761,0,t1_d1c4c3r,There are hints of it in TCW transferring a persons connection to the living force to save another. The Daughter from the Mortis arc Worth a watching lays dying and to save Ahsoka she instructs Anakin how to transfer her remaining connection to the force to Ahsoka to save her. The irony here is thats what Palpatine told him what he would teach him to save Padme. He had the knowledge before becoming desperate to save Padme all along. The problem with this is in order to prolong life you must take it from another. The Daughter represented the light side of the force she offered her remaining life selflessly to save another. By that means the dark side of that would be to take a life by force. Some speculate that this is how Padme died. Im in that club. That it makes sense that Palpatine used Plagueiss trick to cheat death to save Anakin stealing Padmes life force from her. She was the only reason Anakin turned and with her gone he would never turn back to the light. He was wrongThere was another episode where Jar Jar and Mace Windu go on a mission to save a Queen from dark side savages who harvest peoples connection to the living force and give them to the Sith Witch. Best buddy cop team ever.Also the teaser from Rebels S finale has either the Sith Witchs voice or Ventress coming out of a Sith holochron The power to restore life is at your command! Interesting? ,starwarsspeculation,d1c5jkq,1,t5_3a3kv
7023698,0,t3_4bu4on,gt I believe Kylo had something to do with Rey being left on Jakku and possibly even responsible for a memory wipeblock. He has already been shown to read minds and see memories it isnt much of a stretch that he could block them as well. Luke may be able to unblock her memories allowing for a large amount of past information to be revealed to the audience without having to do a traditional flashback.Agreed! The only part is that a mind wipe wouldnt be needed. She genuinely had no idea who her family is because she didnt get to be old enough for her to be able to fully form memories of her family. She was a very small child when she was left there. Children who are abducted much older that that forget their own name after enough time passes. All she remembers was to wait there if she left nobody would ever find her. To a child thats all you would need to say to scare them for the rest of their lives. I have said in an earlier post that the only person who knew she was still alive was Kylo Ren because everyone believes he killed her. When Finn mentions Luke to Han You knew him right? Fords acting tells me all I need to know. The pain that could only be saying Yeah I knew him my son killed his child The scene of her flying with him on the Falcon and saving the day she doesnt just remind him of Luke he realizes who she is. When she says I didnt know there was so much green in the galaxy. Again Han feels responsible for that because it was his belief in his failure as a parent that caused her to be lost.But its him realizing that Ben Solo didnt kill Lukes daughter that gave him hope there was still good in his son. Han and Leias conversation is after he would have told her who he thinks Rey is and Leias powers would allow her to be sure of her true identity. I think they didnt make a big reveal because they didnt need to. Everything is all there without driving it home.The novel also confirms that Kylo Ren knew who she isTaken aback he whirledto see the weapon land in the hand of a girl standing by a tree. Rey appeared equally shocked that her reach for the device had exceeded his. She gazed down at the weapon now resting in her grip.It is you Ren murmured. in the movie Adam Drivers performance confirms it to meHis words unsettled her Not for the first time he seemed to know more about her than she did about herself. But she had no time to ponder his comment nor was she inclined to do so anyway she was too consumed with rage. ,starwarsspeculation,d1chks6,15,t5_3a3kv

7058450,0,t3_4c8nep,Yes Yes Yes! Thanks for taking the time to put all of this together. It never ceases to amaze me how people say Rey Skywalker is boring and lazy writing as if just saying Rey is just a random force user isnt. As much as seeing another Kenobi would be great Obi Wan has his legacy and to have a whole new backstory for him suddenly appear like how he somehow fathered a kid who then had a kid would be unrealistic and unnecessary. Overall I think TFA did tell us who Rey is and all of this speculation is just distracting us from a much bigger reveal come ep . ,starwarsspeculation,d1gfoep,2,t5_3a3kv

Anyway Im with you in this camp except for Kylo being Ben SkywalkerWhen Plagueis and Palpatine were dickin around with the Force Ill avoid the M word the Force hit back by creating a physical embodiment in the form of Anakin.. I think its extremely likely that the Force did this again in the form of Rey.. I think were being mislead with all the nods to her being a Skywalker only to find out that Kylo is Lukes son.Just imagine itLuke You can still come back from this. You can come with me and help me finally put an end to SnokePlagueis. Please.. After everything hes done.. He has to be stopped and i need your help..Ben Everything hes done!?! What about what Ive done?! Luke You havent done anything that you cant come back from..Ben You dont know what Ive done.. Or what I can do. Han Solo thought he knew what I was capable of. He suffered dearly for... such a lapse in judgement. The last thing that Solo felt in this life was the heat of my blade! Do you see now what Im capable of?!? Luke I know what youve done. But i also know what youre capable of because i know that there is still some GOOD left you. Ben He was my Father and I murdered him in cold blood!! Whatever good you sense in me is just mistaken sentimentality... And this flaw MASTER Skywalker says name mockingly will be the death of you..Luke You are guilty of a lot of terrible things but murdering your father isnt one of them..Ben furious now I STUCK MY BLADE IN HIS HEART AND WATCHED HIM FALL!! I KILLED MY FATHER!Luke Ben no.. I am your Father.....Keep in mind i dont write professionally so this might be silly dialogue but i wanted to just get to the point.. I think it just sort of makes sense thematically and from a sorry telling perspective.. I know it kinda flies in the face of what TFA told us but TESB did the same thing with ANH.. I also think that both the Skywalker family and Plagueis need to be wiped out for the Force to finally be balanced. Now if Rey was conceived through the Force like Anakin she isnt technically a Skywalker but is still spiritually related which means she gets to live and still function as the defacto Skywalker..Ep.  Luke dies at Kylos hand.. Ep.  Kylo finally embraces the good and dies while fighting Snoke with Rey..I know it seems like more of the same but its like poetry it rhymes.. Obviously this is only a small part of the story as a whole and there are other characters to consider but i think this is basically where were heading..

Id guess this is the Emperors Hand or personal agent or whatever they want to call it in the cloak kneeling before a distant and unseen Emperor Palpatine. Hes got Snoke in the tank remember Snoke is supposed to be big for reasons unknown to us.Why is this most likely? Primarily because of the Royal Guards. Theyre in that room for their one purpose protect the Emperor. Theyre not moving in with the hooded figure theyre already there. So the Emperor therefore MUST be in the room. And whoever this hooded figure is theyre bowing to the man in charge. Snoke being in the tank is just a guess but Id say a guess with a footing in fact. That tank is freaking huge.

We dont yet even know for sure that its Palpatine kneeling it seems fairly likely but theres even the possibility that Palpatine is in the tank seeing as it seems to be in his quarters and being guarded by the Emperors guards.We dont know that the injuries received by Snoke are of the severity that would require being Plagueis to recover from or require Plagueis techniques to be saved by though all we really know is some scars and a slightly caved in head. A bacta tank could be enough to heal those given the time scale it appears Snoke emerged.To my eyes it adds unnecessary complications for it to be Plagueis rather than tying things up nicely so its interesting to see that you have the literal opposite perspective! ,starwarsspeculation,d1v2q5k,1,t5_3a3kv

My favorite in particular is that the force constantly produces agents of change or chosen ones whenever there is an imbalance in the force. It is possible that these agents are miracle births or that the force may choose someone who already lives and awaken within them. If Snoke is Plagueis he would not be compelling as a villain at all considering that he has been completely inactive since his faked death or resurrection or was captured and held prisoner or what have you. Our heroes would be facing someone who was previously defeated by someone Luke and Co already defeated.

It took Hux to convince Snoke to even attack the Resistance! Snoke is too interesting and too shrouded of a character to be just a prop put there to mislead. Even outside of the movies the Canon basically sets up Snoke to be something very significant.I am not exaggerating when I say it would be one of the stupidest moves in cinema history. Hey remember that character who said he saw the rise and fall of the Empire who Kylo Ren seems to think is very wise and who drove Luke fucking Skywalker to run away from the fight and hide? And then he spent pretty much all of his FO forces finding him? Yeah was kindve weird they just made him a prop character to mislead. I mean do you have something against Snoke lol?

You could have attachments which make you choose between the two creating conflict.Theres no way of being  sure that your attachments wont cause conflict with what you believe is the right thing to do.

He can either be at home still or with Lukeit doesnt matter. He goes on the mission and does not perform as he was told to do. If he was sent by Snoke Kylo would have had surreptitious contacts with Snoke while he was with Luke he was supposed to kill Rey or bring her to him. If he was sent by Luke he was probably supposed to retrieve Rey.He disobeys them in a strange moment where he feels strongly about this little girl and he brings her to Jakku. This is why he is so FASCINATED and DISTURBED when he hears about a girl on Jakku.For years in his mind there has been a strange echo of this girl he left on Jakku in defiance of his masters orders. Many years later by coincidence he is brought to Jakku while pursuing Luke Skywalker. The reason he reacts so dramatically to the news of the girl is that there has been a girl on Jakku rattling around in his head for  years.

Is that all those VII leaks could have been true with an early draft.The thing is Imagine if Reddit existed in . Now imagine someone leaking info about a character named Han Solo. Early drafts of ANH had Solo as a green alien. My point is things change from revision to revision. Concerning the Lando thing  It might still be true.  On set or at Lucasfilm at that time the crew may have very well been discussing Finn  Landos son. Just because that wasnt in TFA doesnt mean it isnt or wasnt true.Concerning his VIII leak. A. Leia using the force seems very probable nothing really to discredit there. B. Rey not being Lukes daughter is also probable. There really isnt anything about this leak that isnt believable.

8142982,0,t3_4qgcgw,I really believe that Kylos familiarity with Lor San Tekka is a connection through Luke.  San Tekka was an explorer and somewhat of an archaeologist in the Star Wars realm  he collected objects and studied cultures becoming a sought after commodity in backwater circles for anyone needing insight on a region or race culture within the unknown Outer Rim regions to foster relations with once the Battle of Jakku was over it was a relations freeforall in a race to strengthen regional power and consolidate galactic control.  Luke was dealing with a galaxy that had a generation of learning the Force was evil because of Sidious and his fathers callous usage.  Fear of a Jedi would require a soothsayer of sorts as an inbetween and Tekka was a strong voice for trust having already witnessed the fall of the Jedi and believed them innocent of the atrocities of which they were accused.  Luke had an equally insurmountable task of overcoming the general propaganda Sidious had pushed.  A galaxy was against the Jedi in the aftermath of Endor and Luke needed access to some remote areas to continue his search for any credible items or locations the first temple which indigenous tribes or settlers had no doubt recolonized.  The three of them were no doubt comrades on several missions and excursions which would be Bens first contact with these charged items and the beginning of his descent into Kylo Ren.,starwarsspeculation,d4vf2p5,1,t5_3a3kv

8214170,0,t3_4rq3m5,Killing your own father a beloved character in SW universe in cold blood and when there was no longer a particular reason or circumstance for doing so is pretty unredeemable. People say what Vader has done was worse and while true much more easily dismissible. Anakin killing younglings breaks character and immersion when you watch canon with continuity eps III TCW eps. III Rebels IV VVI and Hayden Christensens Anakin was never as compelling up to that point. Nor were the younglings and the Jedi Academy fleshed out or developed enough for us to care. Like bottle episodes in television people throw them out. As a side the Jedi massacre did serve a purpose not to mention precedents note Biblical history where euthanasia was used often to secure throne for posterity to eliminate all futurepotential enemies of the state. Kylo Ren murdering Han over essentially nothing at that point cannot be ignored. You can try to redeem him but will be hard to do without disrespecting the audience. Fleshing out his backstory may help but I have a hard time seeing how they do this unless they use nonsaga films or other media.

Why would he write a script for the film at the same time that someone else was? He wrote a treatment  Which he says was rejected by Disney but George says a lot of things.Disney has made no indication that they dont really like the prequel trilogy They have made multiple references to it with Rebels Ahsoka Shes getting her own novel ObiWan and Anakin had a marvel comic mini series theres countless referecnes to prequels in the vader comic there are more prequel era official action figures coming out TFA lego game has a ton of easter eggs and references to the prequels they constantly make references to prequels on social media posts... My point is that Disney hating or banning the prequels is an idiotic rumor based on people who already dont like the films... Rey being Anakin is just as idiotic and silly as Rey PalpatineKenobi and Im not sure why you think Disney would trash two characters for the sake of a Twist that makes no sense  Also big information that reincarnation BS is part of a fan theory that origniated on gag The OP NEVER claimed it to be a leak or a script but his OWN ideas that he thought up after watching the film. Disney isnt basing what they do around whether or not a group of people didnt like a sixteen year old movie trilogy.

8352309,0,t1_d5ldpn0,It will swing both ways. To use your Marvel example think back to the reveal of the Mandarin. Remember how many hard core fans cried out at the injustice that was done to the character? Not being familiar with his backstory I thought the reveal a brilliant move and utterly hilarious. I then found myself being lectured several times by friends on what a slap in the face that was.Back in the realm of Star Wars Ive already heard two people complain about Thrawn having irises instead of just red eyes one hoping its just because hes a half breed. Theyre both super excited to see Thrawn but already theyre grumbling over the character not being exactly the one theyve read about. Ive likewise heard endless complaints about how they misused Revan in SWtOR. To me this all boils down to the risk vs payoffIf they pull an already established character from Legends they will have fans complaining over every little change they make the more loved the more nitpicks theyll get. Even if it works in the movie some will forever bitch because it contradicts their headcanon thats been built around some book they read way back when. If they make him new or based on a character that they established themselves like the Son of Mortis which has little to no legends material shaping his character and outcome even if he doesnt live up to what we might want they dont get the added flac for ruining a fanloved character. Imagine if Phasma as we know her now was actually hyped up as some Legends character in the vein of Revan Bane Thrawn etc. How much worse would the fallout have been?,starwarsspeculation,d5llb6i,2,t5_3a3kv

And vice versa.Who they will be a descendant from is most likely simple. Figuring out who is not. Which is why the list goes on and on as well as in circles. Rey as Lukes daughter is on the top of the list. It is the most obvious on the list too. Which is why some have a problem with it. Enter in Kenobi Palpatine Solo reincarnation etc... Rey as a Skywalker just happens to deflate the story to some. Finns family is as mystery as well. Mostly overlooked but if Rey isnt a Skywalker or anyone else his parentage my be more relevant then we suspect right now. So again speculation is in order.

8580700,0,t3_4x9tsv,On another note. Did anyone watch Star Wars Celebration with the Rogue One Panel?! I thought it to be odd when Jyn Erso actress was asked for a comparison to her character. She brought up  names that she doesnt share anything with. She named Luke and Rey. In the way of she knows who she is. My take is that its her kneeling before the Bacta Tank and she will be Mara Jade or a form of her. In the movie we will see her progress from Palpetines hand and it will be her father that turns her good before his death. She will send the information with Rogue one and will be the only survivor. To me this story will fit into The Skywalker legacy as she will go on to be with Luke shortly after Return of the Jedi we will get that story in episode  and  Rey will be the daughter of Skywalker. Jyn will be her mother. Also her mother fearing for Reys life will take her to Jakku and leave her with Plutt who I believe works with Tekka at the time. She will then go back to help Luke and will be murdered by the Knights of ren. Im a believer that Luke is burning her body in Reys force vison. It would tie into every movie of Jyn is someForm of Mara Jade. It would explain what Maz said about who left her is never coming back but the belonging she seeks is ahead with her father. Why Kylo Ren is holding the Skywalker light saber In the vision Bc he killed Jyn. Luke would have given it to her. Technically rogue one would be a Skywalker story from a certain point of view! Which also would give Rogue One Im Your father moment Bc we expect in  but Rogue one would supply that Bc Jyn being Mara Jade would turn out to be Reys mother! They could shock you in this movie instead. things that have always stuck out with me about Tey being Lukes.  the second trailer where Like is talking to someone The first trailer was Snoke talking to Kylo as we know now While probing her mind Kylo sees the Island which apparently Rey has seen in a vision or dream.

At age three a little boy pulled her hair. Rey force choked him Luke whisked her off to a far away orphanage.

To test Bens loyalty he must destroy the fledgling Jedi and all Skywalkers. Luke senses this and puts Rey into hiding. Luke then heads to the Jedi Temple a moment too late as Kylo strikes down the last remaining Jedi. Both are seriously wounded. Kylo takes the girl but cannot extinguish the last remaining light. The light that keeps him from killing Rey. He leaves her on Jakku with instructions to keep the girl safe from harm but still harsh. Kylo convinces himself that he made the wise and dark choice. It may give him leverage over Snoke in the future or even an apprentice.

At least to me it is clear that the saga films are for the Skywalkers and the anthology films are for expanding the universe in the way that you say you want it expanded. To be totally honest. I dont understand why people want the universe expanded in the Skywalker stories. Especially since now we have a Star Wars Story coming out every other year. gt This trilogy seems less focused on a specific character or bloodline and more about community and working together.I think teamwork has been pretty central to the entire saga and when people go it alone bad things happen like Anakin in Clones and Luke in Empire. Im not sure if this is exclusive to Awakens. Not trying to be argumentative or to say that you are wrong in thinking what you think. I just think what makes the saga films special is because its a soapspace opera about Skywalkers and I dont see how breaking the mold in the last trilogy helps that story.,starwarsspeculation,d78ij7m,1,t5_3a3kv

The fact we dont know it yet is driving this sub nuts. The funny part to me is that she was never not Lukes. The reason the Ardnt draft was rewritten was because it had too much Luke in it and he overshadowed Rey. They couldnt develop her character with her father hanging over her every move.

He was close seems he had the Rathtars already so why would he not deliver them or want to finalize his transaction? He is a known procrastinator and there was an FO presence there he would want to avoid so it is possible. I like the idea the idea of the Hutts involvement. I have been suspecting the same thing and I have heard that GL had a post ROTJ outline for their continued involvement in galactic affairs. I think it very well may tie in more closely with the central characters too! Remember Jabbas relation with Gardulla who was AnakinShmis former master?

9027639,0,t1_d7wytno,Whatever youre obviously not understanding what I am trying to say. I am saying that doing something out of anger or using a darkside power to do a good thing isnt necessarily evil. Being angry at an injustice and using that anger to get justice with maybe some force lightning thrown in there doesnt make you evil and it doesnt make the darkside evil. Doing evil thing using the darkside is evil and it happens to make the darkside grow. Im not arguing that. Too much darkside is BAD I get that I acknowledge that I subscribe to that idea. But so is too much light! Imagine a Jedi Order who gets all authoritarian about its beliefs and forces a world or the galaxy to subscribe to worshiping the Lightside of the Force but then killing anyone who does not? Im not saying thats what they did but I am saying that it is a possibility if the Light goes unchecked. If this act were to occur the darkside would grow to counteract the evil done in the name of the Lightside of the Force. Balance must be achieved through controlling oneself and their emotions but not becoming a zealot in either the light or dark.Is Luke Skywalker evil for using Force Choke on a Gamorrean in Episode ? Is Luke evil for using his anger towards Vader when Vader taunts Luke about turning Leia evil? No Luke found balance by using his anger to defeat Vader but then turning away from it. ObiWan did the same thing with Darth Maul in episode  rightfully angry that his master was just killed using that anger to his advantage.Yoda also had darkness within him he wasnt pure light. He had fear within him fear that he could not stop the darkness that was to come. He existed with that fear but he conquered it. He still lived with that fear but he didnt allow it to control his actions. That is balance.I am saying that the Darkside at an extreme is a perversion of the Force. So is an extreme amount of the Lightside. You dont need to achieve perfect balance in order to become One with the Force but you cant be perfectly aligned in one direction or another if you want to become One with the Force.,starwarsspeculation,d7wzavq,2,t5_3a3kv

9149928,0,t1_d8bsjtk,I think he missed out on some deeper criticisms of the film for example the movie hardly ever slowed down. There was no Binary Sunsetesque scene where the movie paused and let the music and emotions take center stage for a minute. There was no slow boil until the reveal that the lowly swamp creature was a powerful and wise sage. There was no tender goodbye from a father to his son. The film didnt seem to understand that slow doesnt always  boring.With the OT it was the chases spaceships and adventure that got our asses in the seats but it was the smaller slower moments that kept us coming back for generations. In TFA I thought the moment where Rey looks out onto a lake for the first time we were going to get a truly emotional moment. But nope. Time to keep moving. The second biggest flaw for me was that there was very little character development. Sure A New Hope wasnt strong in that department either but I was expecting more from this movie. If you were to ask me what changed inside of Rey during the movie what flaws she overcame besides learning to use the force really fast I couldnt come up with much. Same for Finn. The characters start out flawless and end up flawless. In the original movies Luke started out as a knowitall brat and became a more reserved hero. Han started out a scoundrel and learned to become selfless. Leia started out a a bit of a hotheaded bitch but learned to become tender and caring.All that wrapped together with the same beats of the OT and youve got some pretty big problems. Dont get me wrong it was overall a well made movie but it had its downsides.What I think this review nailed however was the commentary on the state of Star Wars.,starwarsspeculation,d8btipe,12,t5_3a3kv

In this time period Vader hires Boba Fett to track down the Rebel pilot who blew up the Death Star and thats when he figures out he is actually the son of Padme. A Naboo mortician who treated Padmes body knew that she was pregnant and had given birth before dying which is not necessarily information that Palpatine would be privy to.

I totally agree about his performance in III its a little patchy but overall I think he did an excellent job as an actor. Haydens emotional performance is very good he just has conflict written all over him. He did exactly what Lucas asked him to and gorge has said in the past that he really doesnt care much for dialogue hell watch his movies in French and the prequels as silent films are well composed. I  think the script for III is actually not that bad at all. I like it and it was better then anything anyone else could have created by themselves although minor changes to the narrative would have been hugely beneficial and made it less controversially a great Star Wars film.

He disguises himself as a surviving Jedi of the Clone Wars and helps Luke train a new generation of Jedi... until Luke exposes his cover and almost kills him but refuses to because thats not the Jedi way.

In the case of the lightsaber causing the Force shroom trip in screenwriting terms this is Reys call to action its something that would have to have happened to her not something she did.

If she speaks with a different accent then yes Rey most likely developed it from Jakku.

Its when certain people are moved by something greater than themselves!  Some call it divine intervention. Well this is what I believe is happening to Rey. Shes being moved by the Force.  All thoughtout TFA people are also being affected!  Gracious how can we forget about our Finn?  He was stolen as a baby and brainwashed and programmed to do one thing......and yet he woke up!  Everyone is feeling it....even Snoke!  The reason people want to associate her as a Skywalker is for many reasons. I completely understand! And sure she may have had normal parents was born on Jakku and her parents left.....but it may not matter. Because what matters is shes been chosen by the Force to finish what Anakin Skywalker started. All Rey knows and maybe this was told to her by her parents long ago is that she needs to wait.  Wait for her family!  So when all these events happen like a domino effect she just rolls with it!  Thats why Maz tells her such a prophetic message....thats why Leia sends her to meet Luke. Thats why Finn and BB come into her life when they do. So yes Rey is just Rey.  Shes a mortal thats  been chosen to do something miraculous and monumental.  Something thats needed to finally bring balance!  Does this make any sense?  ,starwarsspeculation,dd15w8b,8,t5_3a3kv

10544888,0,t1_dd3bq1j,Nope. The protagonist is the person who drives the central story forward. The central story is the story of Anakin and Luke and how they relate to each other. If Leia was as important as Luke to the central story she wouldve somehow been there in the pivotal moment when Anakin changes for the sake of his child. But she wasnt because she was less a part of the central story than Luke. Dont get me wrong she was important but not nearly as important as Luke. She barely acknowledges that Vader is in fact her father. It was Luke who wanted to know the real Anakin. It was Luke who kept the Skywalker name despite being raised by Owen lars. It was Luke who believed in Anakins ability to return. Leia totally gave up on Anakin because she had bail organa. She didnt need Anakin because she always considered bail her father. But Luke didnt have one so he insisted on changing him back. She even begged Luke to not confront him. Without Luke the story wouldnt have reached the climax it did and Anakin wouldnt have changed.

10820323,0,t1_ddvzq79,gtwhat contradictions? the jedi repeatedly state that the chosen one is prophesied to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force.I think Im understanding where the communication breakdown is Im not trying to be argumentative so this is my understanding of what has happened up to the point of the end of TFA.Im coming at this from the understanding that whatever the Jedi said in the prequels has to be examined as though they were not correct about everything. Everything we are told is from the Jedis understanding yet we are given evidence to what is really going on that the Jedi do not have. gttell me exactly what is contradictory. In TPM QuiGon tells the Jedi Council of an attacker Maul who is trained in the Jedi arts he presumes that the Sith have returned.  The Jedi do not believe it as they are certain that their mastery of the force would have sensed it. The Jedi were very wrong about this as evidenced by Order  and many other moments. Then QuiGon brings up the vergance in the force around a boy. Mace then says You are referring to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the force?No mention of Sith here thats not till the next movies when their abilities to use the force had diminished and they were focussed only on the war and destroying the Sith. If it were about the Sith those two separate topics of The Prophecy and The Sith Returning QuiGon had with the Jedi would have merged into one bigger conversation if the Jedi at that  time were concerned that they were part of the same issue. The Jedi are unreliable narrators at this point in the story. Their judgement was clouded enough to fight a war not report their diminished force abilities to the senate and they thought it was all about them. The biggest hints in the Clone Wars are the moments where its stated that the Jedi are not the end all be all. This is an unpopular thing to say but it wouldnt be in there if it didnt matter and wasnt true. And the Yoda arc the last shot with the Force Tree that Luke saved in Shattered Empire A path to victory has been found not victory in the Clone Wars but victory for all time.The biggest contradiction is we have the same situation as before. A dark side using mastermind with giant balls in space that shoot lasers and an apprentice who uses the dark side and has a red lightsaber. Just because they arent called Sith doesnt mean they havent filled that same position under new management. But the  is still a Skywalker so nepotism still seems to be a thing. If the last line in the six season long show is Yoda going on a path to victory for all time and we have an even bigger Death Star and a pile of dead padawans the force is not in balance. ,starwarsspeculation,ddw1g7h,1,t5_3a3kv

10900312,0,t3_5vp90l,I still prefer the idea that she is Palpatines granddaughter.Palpatine had an illegitimate child by some mistress or sex slave and had them sent off he would have no use for a potential illegitimate heir especially if they were weak in the Force.The mother told the child who they were and the child then decided to pursue a career in the Empire hoping to excel and fall into their fathers favor. The Empire falls and this illegitimate heir flees fearing for their own safety if they were discovered as Palpatines child and heir.Snoke wanting to undermine the Emperor as well as further end his reign finds the child now adult with their spouse ten years later on Jakku. Snoke probably cares more about the importance of blood ties than political ties when moving his own plans ahead. The parents of Rey OR even their captors are able to secure Reys safety on Jakku and leave her.I see it somewhere along those lines.

The idea that Anakin couldnt have made any other choice in that moment goes against the larger meaning of all the Star Wars films about what makes a hero. Anakins story is tragic because of all the things he had accomplished prior to that moment as a hero Anakin felt was undone by that one terrible choice. It wasnt Mace too was in the wrong by breaking the law. Yes it really was treason what he was doing if I were Mace Id try and do the same damn thing Palps had to go.But in ROTJ he realized he could have made the heroic choices again the entire time. That its never too late to be the hero again.That the devil made me do it isnt the point Lucas is making with that scene. Mace would have beheaded Palpatine had Anakin just let him do it. Although Im completely sympathetic as to why Anakin did what he did it doesnt excuse it. Anakin was played like a fiddle but my point is the story makes it clear that it didnt have to be that way.

Just a oneness with The Force. True balance. Future films are spinoffs hopefully a couple Old Republic films maybe an Origin of the Sith film. Stuff like that.

11697843,0,t3_66utxs,The parallel symbolism of Kylo Ren and Rey is obvious... The light Anakin and dark Vader... The instability of Kylo Rens light saber symbolizing the internal conflict within himself between the light and the dark... And I think it also is subtly hinting to us that when things are unstable... they dont last long. They are shortlived. But my intention was to point out that the symbolism at the end of The Force Awakens is telling us that LUKE is on a NEW PATH.  In the past Luke was on the path to becoming a Jedi similar to the Jedi of the recent past... But by presenting him with a light saber the directors are telling the audience that Luke is NOW on a NEW PATH... And if it is a new path it cannot be his former path as the Jedi hero of the galaxy which appears to now be Rey. Which makes his words in the new trailer seem only logical... When you remember that he is no longer on the same path. ,starwarsspeculation,dglyw62,2,t5_3a3kv
