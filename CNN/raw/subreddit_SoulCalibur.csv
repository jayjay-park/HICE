1166829,0,t3_27hgfz,Yes the bot cheats on hard but its terrible at spacing... Just use proper and good movement to evade and punish. Its just like Morpheus says in the Matrix They are bound by the rules of the system. This makes them extremely easy to read and once you get familier enough with its characteristics you should be able to beat the hard and then very hard difficulty with ease ,SoulCalibur,ci0vz82,4,t5_2s8ri
2156856,0,t1_cldpgga,Perhaps. For the most part I like the brave edges. Im not a big fan of some CEs mostly the GI ones. Especially since Xibas does like half life damage if it GIs.,SoulCalibur,cldzi0c,2,t5_2s8ri

9192449,0,t1_d8h63z9,Low damage low range cant block a lot of moves slowest steps and the lowest soul gauge. There is a reason most competitive tier lists put him on the lowest spot in Yoda tier. Here is the SRK wiki tier list which you can cross reference the non star wars with the french matchup chart here. Have you ever actually played in a competitive tournament for SC? I have and I can tell you that after the star wars unban Yoda was never in top .,SoulCalibur,d8h7lh0,1,t5_2s8ri

I wish I could help you but I dont know anything about it really. Good luck,SoulCalibur,dcl2cxn,2,t5_2s8ri
