3427713,0,t3_2zgt9v,The first thing you should do is look at placement rates. My institution  graduates  MS students a year and they have a  placement rate in residencies. Conversely there are other programs that have much lower placement rates lt MS placement rate which is appalling.If you have been accepted somewhere with high rates you probably do not have much to worry about. If not it may be better to wait a year get some clinical experience via shadowing or similar and then applying to institutions with better placement rates.,MedicalPhysics,cpizgo9,2,t5_2tf9a
6233400,0,t1_cyxrqin,The position was a typical clinical one.  It was a junior position in the sense that they were looking for someone who wasnt ABR certified essentially to save a few bucks for a year or so and it is at a private nonprofit hospital. ,MedicalPhysics,cyy64du,1,t5_2tf9a
6732619,0,t1_d0fc1il,No extra time in sense that it wouldnt expand my studying time. It would take a lot of my free time that I have at the moment though. ,MedicalPhysics,d0fpmnz,1,t5_2tf9a

8520264,0,t1_d66ko6a,I dont think they care about part  for a PhD. What do you want to there? Radiology? Rad Onc?,MedicalPhysics,d66ldv7,1,t5_2tf9a
10003246,0,t3_5iv7dd,Do you have an idea of where you want to go after you complete your PhD?  both in career and location,MedicalPhysics,dbbg9so,2,t5_2tf9a
10621053,0,t1_ddb4mlt,Really? When you say modality do you mean IMRT vs DCRT or does that include the IGRT too. The IGRT should be driving you margin choice and not how the radiation is delivered.,MedicalPhysics,ddbhby1,1,t5_2tf9a
10966097,0,t3_5wgkd4,Obviously it depends on how much time you end up putting in and who you are working with.  As a student you could never really do things on your own but after spending some time learning you could end up providing some very hands on assistance.  A lot of people would let you be involved enough that you could do various tasks with the machine you could do tons of practice treatment plans work with equipment and have a really good feel of what the clinical job is like.I think this cant hurt when it comes to residencies.  I personally am not too concerned with clinical experience when it comes to picking residents.  I mean its not a bad thing but its also not a deal breaker.  For me attitude and willingness to learn are worth  clinical hours.  If I were hiring a junior physicist with no expectation of training them it might be a different story.Probably the biggest factor is this There are sometimes issues with understanding what the job actually does and at least understanding that would be a great advantage.    For therapy the schedules are erratic and unpredictable the pressure can be heavy clinical politics can be interesting and you will have to interact with uncomfortable situations gross things patients in extreme pain etc.  Also the work is not physics in the traditional sense.  Im not complaining  these things dont bother me most of the time but its always best to show you know what youre signing up for.  I think some people weight this higher than others.,MedicalPhysics,deb2qdr,2,t5_2tf9a
11000932,0,t3_5x3gam,First thanks to the STSC and mods for putting this together! Your time is well appreciated! Since theres only so much that can be said in  words Ive always wondered what constitutes a wellcrafted supporting document? I noticed that instructions state The Supporting Document should NOT be used for extensive text descriptions... Is this more or less suggesting that our supporting document should be solely figurestables with small captions? Just wondering what sort of information is most appropriate to include  what reviewers expect and like to see.,MedicalPhysics,deex8tz,5,t5_2tf9a
11784415,0,t3_683bim,Dosimetry is a great field. Even though I am a medical physicist I went through the process of getting my CMD credentials because I really enjoy treatment planning.All you need to sit for the CMD exam is a bachelors degree and completion of a month JRCERT Medical Dosimetry program. Note that there are a few different JRCERT Medical Dosimetry program types postbaccalaureate certificate bachelors and masters. All you technically need is completion of a certificate program which would be the shortest route. There are about  such accredited certificate programs and an additional  programs that offer bachelors or masters. You would not need any higherlevel physics coursework beyond what you completed in your bachelors. There would be some radiation physics didactic coursework as part of your dosimetry training but it is pretty easy compared to the pure physics work youve already completed.Pay is about    depending on your experience level and location. Hours can be longish but not terrible usually not much over your standard  hour workweek. Days start around AM  AM and go until PM  PM typically. It can be stressful work now and then because of tight time constraints or because you are sitting around ready to go home but stuck waiting for a physician to come review your work. The complexity of your work will depend a lot on where you are employed. Some places give a lot of latitude to the dosimetrists planning scope and include radiosurgery stereotactic ablative cases HDR brachytherapy etc. Other places those special cases might be the domain of physics while dosimetry gets the more run of the mill work. If you work in an academic institution you might see a lot of tougher cases while a satellite community clinic might be mostly simple breast and prostate cases. If youre flexible with location you can find an environment that suits your personality and get a lot of satisfaction from your job.,MedicalPhysics,dgvsvr5,3,t5_2tf9a
