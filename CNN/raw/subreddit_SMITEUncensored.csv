1203328,0,t3_27v9vw,New skin is artistically fine but bland as hell.  He has no personality anymore and does not look like any incarnation of Hercules outside the Disney cartoon.  The fact that they changed his VP and gem skin is just unbelievable.  I paid money for those products and I dont have them anymore.  It almost feels like theyre deliberately trying to suck the fun and personality out of the character.  ,SMITEUncensored,ci4zqsq,0,t5_2yzh1
