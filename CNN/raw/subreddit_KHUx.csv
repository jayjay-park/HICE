7801629,0,t3_4m4zcp,I dont know the exact drop tables but I can say for a fact that the only Raid Boss that drops FGs  is Guard Armor.Other than that I think that Darksides drop  Speed Ducks and Mythril Stones Omegas drop higher ranked Speed Ducks and Mythril Gems ? Behemoths drop the same thing as Darksides except they drop Power Ducks instead if Speed Ducks Trickmasters drop Magic Ducks and Mythril Guard Armors drop  Moogles and FGs Omegas drop higher ranked Moogles and Yen Sids,KHUx,d3sypez,1,t5_39szw

10362249,0,t3_5obtbf,Either he is trolling with not even a level  keyblade or cheating. I suspect the latter but if you wanna go hardcore i recommend going for quest  or something  times or  to get a guard armor and keep doing that until it is .Or spawn a raid boss at the end of the weekend raid boss event. then farm from there,KHUx,dcimem1,1,t5_39szw

10610385,0,t1_ddadkb1,Evolve it to  star level it to  then evolve it again. The second evolution is the one with Riku and meow. You can see by clicking on evolve button. Then do it again with something with two dots,KHUx,ddadp5n,2,t5_39szw

11585284,0,t3_65bb9c,Id say keep it. iKairi is still one of the best GAU General Attack Up buffer on NA.Plus I personally like Illustrated Ansem for his GDD General defence down. You can use Illustrated Ansem  Illustrated Kairi combo you can heal you after ansem debuff.,KHUx,dg976bs,3,t5_39szw
11599769,0,t3_65fxvl,I would actually swap riku for a general attack up  or  if you have because that will really increase your total damage output. You can then put riku in the place of kh com mickey and you might be good there. For single targets you can swap him for illustated ventus because he might do more damage to one target. HD sora can also be put there but hes more useful for his two turn buff rather than damage. Hope this helped!,KHUx,dgauca7,1,t5_39szw
11628908,0,t3_65ydfh,Not horrible traits but yeah if you have nothing else to spend the mirrors on get KGD to  then reroll for guilt in my experience the number tends to go up more times than it stay the same,KHUx,dge5dry,1,t5_39szw
