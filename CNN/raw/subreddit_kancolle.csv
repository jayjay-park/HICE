3223292,0,t1_cow1g12, Yes unlocking rd and th fleet is quite important. Though you cant do much actively about it just keep grinding and they will drop eventually. Kongou sisters drop like rain in . I wont advise focusing on construction at early stages it can be resource unfriendly and you should do fine with droppable ships. Just do your dailies with basic recipes unless you really need some ship. For example you may want to craft BB early for map bruteforcing or CVL for Akagi quest if you somehow lack them from the maps. You should generally have a wellround fleet with lots of different ship girls leveled due to branching rules and overall comfort. Thats quite a faraway goal for you now anyways. No some are eventonly and are available as dropsrewards only during events. They will be added to LSCdrop tables after some time usually about half a year so eventually they will be craftable too. You shouldt try building anything rare before HQ level  the chances are quite lower. Equipment is situational and some pieces are really important. But that would matter at higher worlds since youve just started you will probably really need to craft only ASW gear for  grinding. Other equipment guns etc that you can easily obtain from ships will suffice for now. And lots of great equipment midget subs AA cutin gear night battle equipment is easier to get or the only way from leveling ships not crafting. For example youll probably want to get your Isuzus to level  her first Kai before feeding them to other girls for the radar that comes with her upgrade.,kancolle,cow3iqd,1,t5_2yjji

3875894,0,t1_cqy2ebi,ok thanks ill play around with equipment. I actually subbed out Maya for Tone and have had Tone trigger AACI much more than Maya but I guess I can rethink that combo the extra bomber has helped a lot in the preboss nodes.I had found more success with placing the heavier ship at the bottom of the fleet setup but I will change that around which is why Fubuki had the searchlight originally Sendai had it which I found doesnt work on a previous map.I have switched Kaga to full green setup due to uDJayDiscos recommendations which did work out ok.Now that I am on the final kill I can see what you say about the FCF Id rather retreat so I have a full fleet than sub out  I was only ever doing that in the preboss node anyway.Thanks for the suggestions Ill have to look at some good combos craft some more and probably spend several hours stockpiling before attempting again for my sanity.,kancolle,cqy32zb,0,t5_2yjji

4261350,0,t1_cs5xgc7,I think  is the most efficient way to do it.I personally use  simply because I like the experience it gives.  Every sparkling run my ship will get  EXP from .  As you can guess that adds up over the weeks and months.Its a bit trickier to sparkle on  Im well over HQ level .  Your ship has a higher risk of taking significant damage it requires more level one DDs three every run so you can choose Line Abreast formation and it might take a bit longer as well.  Ive never timed it so Im not too sure.  At the very least I know its not substantially faster.  The time difference might be negligible.Taking damage isnt a big deal though.  I find my flagship very rarely gets hit on .  When they do get hit its usually significant damage but I get hit so infrequently its something I rarely ever worry about.Anyway onto the main point yes sparkling is worth it if you have the time and patience.  The rewards for great success on expeditions  and  are massive.  Having a near  chance of great success is definitely worth it.,kancolle,cs5z1c0,1,t5_2yjji

Sometimes those puny destroyers will rock your world.This is all building up of course to the undisputed best ship in KanColle. Who is best ship? Youll know it when you see her hear her experience her. Shell be the one you want to lvl  quickest and then put a ring on. That is the only way to determine who best ship is.

The first map last event was an all CLDD fleet which gave a very high drop rate for Kongou class so if you can get Haruna there then you can fill out your fourth fleet. Chiyoda is close to K as well and it might be worth using her as the saiun carrier in your combined fleet since none of the other carriers you have possess a small slot for it.Gear is a bit weak at least  more ReppuuShidenK and  more Type  shells before the event starts.,kancolle,ctujbh9,1,t5_2yjji

4770261,0,t3_3g8hc3,It all comes down to personal preference and how many buckets you think you can afford to spend. If you dont feel like the map is very difficult then not repairing may be fine. If the map is difficult or you have lots of buckets you might even want to use a bucket to repair scratch damage. You might want to repair without a bucket and cycle in a different ship this is easier with more repairs docks. You could also cycle in a different ship and leave repairs for later using Akashi if you have her.A piece of advice plan your bucket usage beforehand. If the map youre clearing is getting close to your bucket budget then start using buckets a little more conservatively. Remember that combined fleet maps will have higher bucket usage.,kancolle,ctvu1u4,1,t5_2yjji

NTR occurs because the victim is placed in an environment where they believe that they will be valued less for having been taken advantage of hence they keep quiet about it and allow their abuser to continue. Its like being afraid to tell your doctor that you have treatable cancer. From there its pure Stockholm Syndrome and once it progresses to that phase theres nothing to be done even with the strongest of attractions beforehand. The only surefire way to prevent NTR is to foster an environment where potential victims are comfortable with disclosing such information. NTR can be prevented but only in an environment where the early stages of NTR are not stigmatized. Foster a caring environment and ensure all those under your care known the warning signs stages and proper care and treatment of NTR and encourage them to tell anyone they know who is suffering from NTR to seek help. Together we can prevent NTR.Paid for by the National Team for Research.,kancolle,cvz18of,5,t5_2yjji

Her equipment while nice is really a bit of a luxury and theres craftable equipment that you can use instead  Reppu and Shiden Kai Ni Ryusei Kai Suisei MA Saiun.  Id wait on her unless youre really in need of more carriers.Chokai Kai Ni has the best offense of any heavy cruiser you can get but if you have any of the Myoko class at Kai Ni theyre fairly close.Roma is actually fairly usable even without a remodel with the same firepower as Kongo Kai Ni more HP but less evasion and armor though this is the case even after remodel.FusoYamashiro however get a whole lot better at Kai Ni with a plane slot and a Zuiun M which at  dive bomb power and  air power so she can contribute meaningfully to air combat on top of her battleship firepower.

6539852,0,t3_457heg,EH ME Clear Amagi Farm FleetThis fleet is one of the most efficient possible  buckets per run  refuel cost. Extremely high S rank rate as well.On medium you can get AI at the boss if Tones zuiun is in good shape this is  of the time and this lets you proc the night recon plane which is nice. On Hard you will always get AD so you can drop the night recon for a radarstarshell on Ooyodo. On easy you can always get AI for night recon to activate.Ship positioning does not really matter I put Ooyodo in nd so the flagship detection does not interfere with the aggroing of the searchlight. I liked rotating the  DD around as flag to keep their morale high.Medium and easy have similar Amagi drop rate. I recommend farming for her on easy. If you want Okinami her drop rate is significantly improved on Medium. On the other hand if you want to quickly finish the event clearing this on medium means you can go back to farming for Amagi without much disadvantage.E M node Akizuki farming MedHard Any ships can be swapped except Kasumi probably. I am not doing this personally but I would recommend Akizukitargetted farming by going as far as the M node so you dont need T shells and such. If you cant perform reigo you can still farm Akizuki by doing CLCLTDDCAV which will go the top north route which is the easiest and least resource use possible. Some experimentation showed that Kasumi in the fleet more or less fixed the fleet comp while using a CAV enabling air superiority at the J and M nodes. Still might have a chance of getting offrouted but does not seem particularly high or I was extremely lucky while checking. If you lack a Zuki for farming it might be advisable to either clear the map first for Hatsuzuki or rely on a normal DD equipped with AACI.On a side note bottom route CGKNO comps can work as well several people have tried it as BBDDCVLCA or BBCVCADD which I found worked well. More on this later.CLDD Light Ship Training I believe its possible to reliably train on this map similar to . If you are over HQ this could be a valuable spot for the next two weeks if you happen to finish the event early. Sample Fleet  Mayathe CA is not required she is there in case you didnt have another source of good AACI. I recommend at least  AACI ship. The rest of the ships can have whatever sonars and antiair you need mostly you will path AEFH rather than ABFH so antiair guns and  sonar are best on the escorts.The antiair nodes automatically award the first ship in the fleet MVP and the minimum rank is B so you can collect constant exp at these nodes for little resource cost. The flag can get high ASW to get MVP at the sub nodes or they can throw it out.Requires rotation repairing or waiting on morale but otherwise cheaper than  in every way maybe a little slower.,kancolle,czvrvep,17,t5_2yjji

6878429,0,t1_d0vwiwk,Thanks. Summer  was exceptional since it introduced new event mechanics  the Boss Debilitation Mechanic more notably  which required more resources in general. It was also a long event with  maps and challenging bosses. Clearing the event no matter the difficulty is always an achievement in itself.In any case how much resources to stock is mostly up to the admiral to decide especially if theyve experienced events before. As you said with Iowa on the horizon and particularly if shes not going to be a clear reward definitely more resources should be stockpiled. Well just have to wait for more news about her.Sure Ill be happy to help.

7254686,1,t3_4ep4wh,There are two kinds of Kancolle doujinshi authors who get on my nerve every time I see one of them One the kind who doesnt know when andor how to draw the line between gameplay and story. Gameplaystory segregation is particularly important for games like Kancolle and is necessary if you want to cater to people who arent satisfied with only cute girls and maybe some ecchi.Second the kind who tries to capture and portrait the ugliness and cruelness of war but doesnt knowdoesnt bother to understand what exactly makes a war such a ugly and cruel thing. A good writer may still make it work but more often than not this usually results in retarded shit that not only doesnt make sense in real life but doesnt make sense in the fictional world because IT DOESNTT MAKE SENSE. In this case the comic obviously has a dark atmosphere to it. The story is decent. But the darkness atmosphere feels forced. And its for being dark simply doesnt make sense.

7290239,0,t1_d26t3uc,Well youre quite new right now and dont have too much playtime I would say the priority isnt to go for Ks but reach at least kai on all your required ships for the event.So try to get a th destroyer to at least kai train at  for a while with priority on Abukuma Ooi and Yukikazes levels let some of your DDs in the s leech up the exp as well.In the meantime train up your kongous and CAs in PvP whenever you can it is very important to take advantage of the  daily PvP for exp. For nonK CAs I recommend ToneChikuma which have above average stats and strong Ks once you get to them. Maya and myoukouclass ships are good to train as well.Once youve got at least  kaid destroyers you should probably switch over to A and do some heavy ship training.Its probably easiest to run with a CV flagship and get both Akagi and Kaga to Kai Id suggest a composition like CV  fBBCASS and load up the CV with full bombers and a yellow gun to increase their range. If you have more questions about that comp dont mind asking.For easy you just need kaid ships look to kai all of your fBBs and CVs and max modernize them should be ok.Going for plane crafts are fine keep doing them.,kancolle,d26uncg,2,t5_2yjji

Im also going to assume that those cmHAAAFD came from a fairly low leveled Akizuki classTry this Main Mutsu Zuikaku kB Shoukaku k Fusou Suzuya Akizukiclass  Escort Abukuma Yuudachi Shimakaze Kitakami Haguro Tone Ships in the order listed Your support expeditions are mostly fine however I would recommend giving each carrier in the boss aerial support expedition a fighterEquipment builds Mutsu standard AP build. Zkk KB DBs in the  largest slots Shiden k or better in the  smallest Skk K DBs in first slot Shiden K or better in  remaining slots Fusou Sanshiki Zuiun Suzuya  Saiun or seaplane fighters if you have any Akizuki class standard AACI build Abukuma CLT DA build Yuudachi DA with searchlight Shimakaze DA with star shell Kitakami CLT DA build. Haguro standard anti installation with night scout Tone GunGunWGT shell.  On CLT use regular .cm.cm kai reds or .cmOTO yellows. .cm reds are bad. Use your best DBs in your support expedition. Give your main fleet CVs regular SuiseisMy reasoningAerial support expeditions seem like theyre coded as a second opening airstrike I could be wrong and as such attaining AS and stuff applies  hence the suggestion to use fighters. I suggested you stick the bombers in the support expedition since the support expedition triggers after the opening airstrike aka after your main fleet fighters have engaged.This means that the enemy air power is weaker in general and therefore your DBs have a better shot at surviving to do damage.Overall this setup should give you enough FP for AS at all nodes with some to spare. The Zuiuns are there mostly to push up your FP. If you have a seaplane fighter stick it on Suzuya and you might be able to get away with giving Fusou  gunsTZuiun. AP on Mutsu should help wipe the arty imps and the Rus With Kitakami and Abukuma TCI is useless. TCI doesnt hit installations and theres a lot of installations at the boss. A DA build can at the very least apply a double scratch instead of the single scratch a TCI build would get. WG on DDs isnt particularly helpful here. Central as a metric fuckton of armour even on easy and a DD with WG simply cant punch through. A CAV with its damage being amplified by a T shell on the other hand can. WG on the CAV pushes that up even more. It does sacrifice daytime DA though.,kancolle,d3oxhyf,2,t5_2yjji

On estimate k at most if having a really bad time.Also another problem is those annoying TaClass Snipe on first node or preboss.EDIT Done v it was a pretty average month prefinal my only issues were first node Ta class Taiha on CACV exploding my CAs but once get to the boss youre good. On final I had to switch to BBCV yasen route cause Im losing steel and bauxite on CACVstarted k steel k bauxite now  digit. Once yasen comp BBCV get to the boss youre fine.

It is recommended to unlock it early since they have great hourly rate for rsc excluding bauxite. While you wait for the long ass expeditions to return you could try and farm  if you have enough buckets the nodes that drop subs are C and I boss node on S rank. If you do not have enough buckets but have lots of computer time spam expedition  for ammo and buckets. You can also try and level your light ships CL CLT DD in  on nodes AB and C if your HQ is lower then . If you dont really want to do anything in the game right now just start doing expeditions that unlock  and  and send your ships on long expeditions  for fuel and ammo  and wait for the long expedition to be done. Keep in mind you need quite a few barrels to run    so you might want to try and craft them or you can do your weekly quest I think it is the one that you need to sink  cvs followed by sinking  subs and scraping  pieces of equipment scrap them one piece at a time.

If Sub Hime or some variant shows up likely given the hint from devs to prep ASW youre going to be praying for so many bits of RNG to line up you might as well give it up.Your plane situation isnt great but its enough. Your ASW is completely inadequate.,kancolle,d5xjgme,2,t5_2yjji

It can be easy to lose perspective.There really is nothing to lose by participating other than a bit of your time. Resources will come back without doing anything assuming under soft cap. Ship rewards eventually show up again. Even in the worst case of sinking a ship you can eventually get another one.Even if one cant get past the first map another event will come along in a few months.

8632848,0,t1_d6kowe1,Theres really not much you can do about the preboss except hoping to hell your ships can dodge the BB himes a LBAS strike also helps. If you want you can try placing  strike on G and the other on the preboss to try and weaken the enemy before the airstrike. Even then its not going to help too much. One of the biggest suggestions I can give is really to use AACI. AACI really really helps in taking down opening airstrikes Ive once shot down every single plane the enemy had using AACI and AS simaltaneously.I feel that you best start leveling your CAs. Having just one leveled CA even then Mogami is a CAV making her weaker at shelling than regular CAs really blunts the offensive power of your fleet. No offense meant but the lack of equipment and the lack of variety of leveled ships means that you will struggle with combined fleets which demands a variety of ships and specialized equipments to deal with enemies.If I were you I would cut my losses and farm E and E. This event were lucky enough to get Ooyodo as a drop from ED which is relatively easy to farm and she gives the FCF equipment when remodeled which is invaluable and may actually help your current situation.However if you want to continue youll need to level up more CAs and build some shells if you can. The amount of damage BBs and CAs can do with shells cannot be understated. As for CAs Takao and Atago are great short term solutions with decent stats at kai and an early remodel level as well. If you really feel like grinding Maya is great too and at K will grant you the AACI you desperately need.P.S. I was wrong about the slow fleet gt gets routed to A part. Apparently that only applies to STF.,kancolle,d6kpogb,1,t5_2yjji

8644538,0,t1_d6m2iyu,I think youre confusing the opening air strike with shelling phase. In the opening air strike torpedo and dive bombers perform their respective roles torpedoing or dive bombing and damage is calculated using the opening air strike formula in its base attack power calculation based on its type. In the shelling phase any CV with any types of bombers remaining in their slots can shell or make an attack that has the dive bombing animation which is subject to the carrier shelling damage formula. So yes torpedo bombers get to attack in the second shelling phase as a part of carrier shelling rather than something similar to the opening air strike.

9234257,0,t1_d8m61dl,Every ship in the game is tagged with an stype which tells the game what type of ship it is. For example all DDs are stype  all fast battleships are  all slow battleships are . It uses this when you sort by ship class it sorts in descending order. Hence all your newer classes are at the start and DDs are at the end and slow BBs appear before fast BBs.  The stypes are then later defined to define what can and cannot be equipped to each class at least historically it was but now you got those exceptions for daihatsus etc. Interestingly they gave names to each of these even though they didnt need to. For instance type  are labeled  and  amp  are both   Of these there are  that dont have any ships associated with the stype. One of these is stype   coastal defense boat and stype   superdreadnaught. If you look at the following and prior IDs this ID falls into after the release of the game but before subs were introduced. One of the ships introduced between those times Yamato. So odds are this  was planned for Yamato but for some reason was scrapped but the values were left in.  As far as why its still left in KCKai guess its not hurting anything and just being prepared. Why not ID? Dunno that maybe less clutter but doesnt explain previous point. Just a bit more explanation than provided here,kancolle,d8micwo,5,t5_2yjji

9262059,0,t3_57907m,Hmmm my fav shipUSS Texas BB Mighty TServing in Both World war  and  the USS Texas at her launch was the most powerful ship in the US Navy alongside her sister for a short time her career could be summed up as first to accomplish X ranging from firing the first American shots of WW April th against a german Uboat that was targeting a merchant ship that was targeted first US BB to mount AA guns  call machine guns and first to use fire control systems on a US Battleship. While her career during WW wasnt anything write home about In  after the armistice was signed she became of the many ships to escort the Imperial German fleet to Scapa flow.Her first modernization in the mid s made the switch from Coal to oil for fuel and replaced her cage mast to tripods. For a short time she was the flagship of the USN also.In WW she activated the st Marine Division in February of  and got two lucky streaks she was stalked by U and was lucky enough for Hitler not order not to fire and wasnt at Pearl Harbor she was in Maine at the time undergoing RampR. Her first modernization around this time  The secondary battery was reduced to six inch guns and the light AA battery was greatly increased  With the two .inch caliber quad mount guns replaced by   later  quad mount  mm . in Bofors    mm . in Oerlikon cannonsShe later served in Operation Torch and later Dday as flagship of Omaha Beach supported the Rangers by filling ammo in LVCP for them. Her guns wernt in range for a fire support so she flooded her Starboard Torpedo Blister so she could list  degrees in order to get in range.  Later in june she contributed in the bombardment of Cherbourg alongside Wyoming and Nevada German coastal defense artillery near Cherbourg hit the ship twice. The first shell exploded injuring  and killing one. This was the only combat fatality ever aboard USS Texas. The second shell hit the ship but did not explode. The Navy deactivated this lucky shell and returned it to the ship as a good luck charm.After VE day she then was transferred to the Pacific and participated in the battle of Iwo Jima and Okinawa there she claimed one kamikaze kill on her own and claimed three assistsAfter her decommissioning in  the State of Texas bought her and made her a museum ship and the flagship of the Texas Navy basically glorified yacht club is one of the first permanent Battleship museums in the US and is over  years old.Its not as grand as say Warspite or such but still impressive enough to work. ,kancolle,d8q16kh,5,t5_2yjji

9728278,0,t3_5dks4m,Summary of notable event dropsAkashi Hatsuzuki Kawakaze Arashi mod for space Hagikaze ...really? I get you right after I mod fod Arashi? Pola.Overall a good haul. My instinct was correct in prioritizing seaplane fighters for prep but I really misjudged using my Chitose class CVL on E because I saw a possible BBCV comp on E. E basically punishes you for taking the long route and destroying your resource morale both in game and irl and buckets. E is heavy on RNG because of the perfect base defense not sure how others that dont have a lot of interceptors will get through with their sanity other than trying to put every slot with a ReppuShinden and hoping for the best. Also hope that RNG is kind and you get Sakawa on Node A if you dont have a Crossroads ship beforehand.General tips for Admirals that are not tackling E hard but other event maps are fair game If you are too lazy to go through E debuff but are struggling to clear it use CLT instead of CA. KTKM and Ooi have more combined FP and Torp than any CA uses the same guns opening torp and a x red  torp will DA at night. That will clear the boss if you feel like she has too much armor for your CA to deal with. For E dont do hard take the short route. For the transport first part use ABKM a ducky and take the short route. Long route has more chances to be taiha and wont decrease bar a lot. Hope your stockpile is enough your goal should be the short route with the DD so you can move on to the nd phase faster. For the nd part also take the short route. This means saving Chitose and Chiyoda for E as they are the best fast CVL for the nd phase with a good distribution. Also if possible and you have her save Iowa ABKM and a ducky for E. You will need it. Again more nodes means more chances to be taiha and a heavy comp will face an extra air raid node as well as a battle with Wo Kai flagships. This isnt getting into the  Rus if you are on Hard... For E easy or normal do the requirements piece by piece if you dont have enough planes to set and forget on your bases. First aim for S ranking Air raids and node A putting your best fighter planes on ships. Then put those fighter planes on  land bases and set them to defense I think maximum bases you can put on defense is  if Im reading my kanji right. If you dont have Reppu or Shinden  or  if you want Saiun also for your dailies.  You have  weeks there is no rush. Please remember this and keep calm. After the first week you can start to actually panic. Yukikaze is best DD.EDIT One thing I missed was to save SS comp for E chipping if you are going to do EH.

9753950,0,t1_daf5stj,Realistically?    You will surely be able to clear E TP phase. Thats just about throwing yourself against a brick wall enough times. E HP phase maybe. You dont have a K fast CVL. That means you need to bring  of them just for AP. The lack of Shinden K or Reppus just compound to that problem. You have  ship capable of a powerful TCI that can potentially oneshot the boss. Because of the  CVLs though youre going to have fewer ships firing at yasen. A CLT DA on CV Hime followed by Beavers Miracletm should be sufficient to kill her but thats a big gamble.    E? You wont have trouble with opening the nd start point. Thats easy. The problem is the second phase. You have  CVs. That means you will be forced to bring a CVL and thats something you really dont want to do going against  wo flags. I brought  CVBs for EE and  of their slots were filled with Shinden Ks and Reppus. To achieve AS youre going to need to fill almost all slots in your CVs and CVL. That cripples your firepower a lot. LD is going to be difficult. Without a nuke ship its very likely that you will see the BWS BB Hime and Jelly Hime in yasen. You have  ship capable of TCI and  nonK CLT. Even if Beaver aims at the boss rolls a max damage TCI and rolls minimum armour on the boss that isnt enough to  shot it from full. You also have to consider that a single run in EE to the boss costs about  bauxite. How many tries can you attempt?    Imo its hella risky to try and you may get nothing for it. I cant make decisions for you. If I were in your position I would focus on acquiring eventonly ships that would help clear Winter . From E get Akizuki Kashima is nice but optional. From E grab Kumano and Ooyodo. From E hunt for Mizuho Akitsushima Mikuma. Also grab Hiryuu. E is the most convenient map to farm for her. Shes kinda rare in normal maps and is strong at K with very good stock equipment.  Mikuma and Kumano upgrade into CAVs that are useful for transport maps. While the Toneclass beats them they require BPs. You will probably only get  more by Winter. One should go to ABKM no question. If the event is infested with installations you may end up BPing Ooshio. Ducks for AACI which should be obvious. Mizuho for AV just in case they get something special. Akitsushima to steal her taiteichan which has become a staple in events for allowing LBAS to reach boss nodes. Ooyodo for her FCF which is invaluable for chipping runs because it means  taiha wont immediately result in a retreat.,kancolle,dafe4vl,3,t5_2yjji

9763320,0,t3_5dktqb,Well news for the E debuff After I got Srank on the required nodes in E for its debuff the confirmation sound didnt go off when I got back to base but after I went to get more LBAS interceptions in E and it went off after I got only . So I think you can still accomplish the land base interceptions one at a time but it might also be just for those of us who completed E on easy because when I was completing it on easy I almost never got  air raids at the land base in a single sortie. Sadly I dont have a count on how many effect interceptions I got for the land base so Im going to assume that it still needs  total. It also may have just needed to refresh for me because I did E on easy and am doing E on medium the AS requirement I couldnt make for the bosss LD sadly but either the case I figured Id add what I experienced to try and help out since it still seems debatable on the LBAS part of the debuff trigger.Also as a side note for those interested Yuugumo dropped for me When I Sranked E J node on medium was a pleasant surprise for me at least.,kancolle,dagjoix,1,t5_2yjji

9820928,0,t1_dan8g1x,Nothing has really changed in terms of fleet composition.  You start from the west.  Either CL flagship or Akitsushima.  I prefer CL flagship for the easier first node and to avoid bringing a ship that always explodes.  Make sure to have enough fighter power to get at least air parity on the RuFlagship node.  Thats where seaplane fighters are great.  You will almost certainly have some retreats but thats something you just have to accept and deal with.LBAS to the boss node unless you want the full preLBAS experience of sometimes failing to eliminate a single enemy.  Either one fighter with three bombers or four bombers.  Whichever you prefer.  It will be incredibly effective either way.  Getting air superiority for your LBAS is not very important as the majority of your lost planes will come from the artillery imps shooting them down.After that you have two options both of which Ive seen be highly successful  . Forget about artillery spotting and load up with as much antiinstallation equipment as you can while hoping for day battle oneshot attacks..  Acquire air superiority and equip your ships for artillery spotting.  It limits how much antiinstallation you can bring on the BB CAV and CL but obviously if they double attack during the day battle they will destroy things.The second option is particularly good for those with a very limited supply of antiinstallation equipment.  WG is the most versatile piece of equipment as it can be equipped by nearly everyone and is effective against everything.You can give your DDs two guns and one tankWG for a strong night battle double attack or you can give them a oneshot combo.  Neither is really the best option as there are pros and cons to both.  I believe tank  T is the most effective oneshot combo but I forget where I read that.  It might require them being max upgraded.For reference these are two of the fleets I liked the most while clearing  Akitsushima fleet CL flagship fleetI did not attempt the artillery spotting setup as I have a million WG and wanted to make use of them.If youre looking to have some fun you can give Akitsushima a tank and some WG and watch her blow stuff up.,kancolle,danop1f,2,t5_2yjji

10300710,0,t1_dcaudw8,Getting more Ryuusei Kai is not a bad idea if you only have one  its the best torpedo bomber you can craft.  You didnt mention dive bombers but Suisei MA are equally good as well.  You probably have enough ReppuuShiden Kai for now although keeping any others you get certainly wont hurt.  If you dont have one try to get a Saiun recon plane.  You only really need one and it has a lot of utility value in some carrier compositions.Building .cm twin guns for your CLs and cm HA guns for your DDs is a good idea if they dont have them already.  Building radars type  surface type  surface type  air are a good long term investment.  Building asw gear sonar and depth charges is also helpful if you dont have any.Depending on what expeditions you have unlocked having more drums might help you to get great success more resources.,kancolle,dcbn3e2,1,t5_2yjji

TCI if you like dancing with RNG. Starshell or searchlight on one of the fodder DDs may help at yasen. Engines torp setups on fodders may help as well doubt it.

If you are again  you will get figures you can buy even today for very very cheap whether its bootlegs or cheap lines like SEGAs  so were talking    about what you mention. And we shouldnt forget that you cant just feed D printer anything  it will have to be preprocessed for the printer meaning it will be more expensive than bulk plastic.Top grade figures simply use higher quality material doesnt stink so heavily and if you give it some time on air then almost not at all doesnt start to sweat can have smoother finish instead of looking like pure plastic etc. and are basically hand painted. If you will want to reproduce high quality figure on D printer  lets assume a future very good one  you will still spend so much on materials and your time that it will be almost the same price for those if not more.Yes D printer can drop the price somewhat.

10496409,0,t3_5qaqh1,Ive never power leveled in the traditional sense and I never will.  This game is very long term.  For me its about making small progress every day with it eventually leading to a big pay off weeks or months down the line.  If you can get into a nice routine you can steadily raise the strength of your fleet and take no more than  minutes per day.In the early and intermediate stages of my playing days I would do my daily quests on  or  depending on what ships I wanted to level.  These days I use .  The process is very simple.  Sortie until you complete the easier daily quests up to Bd and youre done.  For  that means  sorties with the leveling fleet to complete the daily quests then a couple of submarine sorties to  or  to get the transport andor carrier kills.  With  it takes me six to eight sorties depending on how things go.By setting up a daily quota I have managed to be prepared for every event Ive participated in without the need for panic grinding.  Youre welcome to do more if you want but a small amount of sorties plus daily PvP is sufficient to get things done.  People tend to exaggerate how high your ships need to be leveled to clear events or quests.  Aiming for their highest remodel is good enough.  There are also onetime weekly and monthly quests to be done with whatever free time you have available.  I recommend doing those with ships you actually want to level rather than going for the cheapest fleet possible.  Every little bit of experience adds up in the long run.,kancolle,dcxvmu1,1,t5_2yjji

10731985,0,t1_ddmw4bu,You preferably want them higher than  though level ish subs technically can run just fine as well with a lower success rate. The higher your sub level the better the success rate but also the longer the repair times. If your subs are over level  you dont need midget subs. Equipping engines is the best for fuel farming otherwise just equip any torpedo. Personally I prefer to run  really high leveled subs  at a time and once they get red HP I dock them. Orange HP is no big deal dont bother docking. Once all  of them are red I take a minute break and repeat it again.For orel cruising dont remodel any sub that turns into an SSV because it drastically increases repair time. ImuyaYuu can be remodeled though since they dont turn into SSVs.,kancolle,ddmx9vt,1,t5_2yjji

The only threat before boss is a single node with ASW it also happens before the dropoff point so theres really no risk of losing Saiuns before boss. Node  boss support made it easy.  attempts got A. Setup || ReplayPreLD and LD I chose to go with fast STF to avoid the sub node. I also did not think that it is worth sacrificing AP shell for hotels to become fast so I used natural FBBs. Since I was lazy I only used node support up until LD where I added boss support. I think that it is worth adding boss support preLD since it could mean another  shots at the boss at night.  attempts  retreats.

If not and if you have enough baux try to craft some more Reppus.Unless you have luckmodded them Yuudachi Kitakami and Jintsuu have too low luck to consistently rely on the night torp cutin. Shigure is  level away from Kai Ni and she has  luck with her KaiNi form so she would be a better choice for having a torp cutin. Put the CLTs at the bottom of the fleet as they might have a better shot at the boss at night.Make sure at least the first  ships of the support fleet is sparkled so they can trigger.

10918265,0,t1_de61eq8,Sounds like RNG is giving you the finger.On a more serious note there are some small optimizations you can make but a lot of it depends on what you have available..  Where are Maya and Kitakami?  Did you lock them on E?  Its very unusual to see someone run four DDs in the escort fleet.  Mayas night battle damage would be preferable over Akizuki and Kitakamis reliability would be preferable over a torpedo cutin DD..  Are Abukuma and Kasumi luck modded?  Their base luck is a bit on the low side to rely on cutins.  For that matter running four torpedo cutins with no night battle equipment whatsoever is your own fault.  You are relying on luck even more than usual without those bonuses to cutin rate.  Missing out on the night scout also means everyone isnt gaining  base damage and a bonus chance to critically hit..  Iowa is way over the firepower cap even in headon engagement.  You could distribute those inches to Hiei and Kongou to slightly increase their headon damage.  Iowa can reach the cap in STF with .cms and a few modest equipment improvements..  The AP shell bonus does not work on support expeditions.  Using them might not be bad in this situation since it doesnt appear you have many good radars.  Most people would prefer a second radar or a third gun though.  AP shells are a weird middle ground but again without quality radars the accuracy bonus AP shells give is at least something..  The .cms on your support DDs serve no purpose.  Their noncritical hits dont have enough firepower to penetrate the armor of anything on the boss node.  A third radar could help them do scratch damage a bit more often..  Are you getting air denial or air incapability with your land bases?  One fighter and three bombers is a very specific setup that only works properly with extremely high tier planes.  For the final kill on hard I believe you need  fighter power to get air denial for the first base and less in the second base as the enemy air power is whittled down.  For most people that will mean two fighters in the first base and one fighter in the second base.If youre struggling to reach the boss you could try a CVL flagship.  If thats not an issue then dont bother.  The artillery spotting bonus that flagship grants to your BB is good.Jintsuu and Maya are options that can help you carry some night battle equipment.  One of your benched CAs could achieve the same goal.  Using Myoukou and Prinz instead of Kasumi and Shigure would allow plenty of room to bring the night scout and a star shell.  You could also fit a searchlight somewhere if you wanted to.If you have a SCAMP then using Tone or Chikuma with gungunSCAMPSeiran will provide similar night battle double attack damage as Kitakami and Ooi.  MainsecondarysecondarySeiran is also an option for a bit weaker night battle double attack.Ayanami Kai Ni is a strong option for torpedo cutins.  In her third slot she can carry a piece of night battle equipment to help with trigger rate or a sonar for maximum damage.  She doesnt quite reach the cap with two torpedoes and night scout activating like Yuudachi can but Ayanami comes with  base luck as a tradeoff.EDIT  Yeah I didnt even notice that Type  Shell on Kirishima until DeadlyWalrus pointed it out.

Its Shigures turn...She aimed ... and throw her torpedoes like a paralytic granny for a rubbish  damages.

11020984,0,t1_deh743k,She then kept traveling around the world gathering material for her Heavy Cruising the Pacific best selling book. On th June she takes part in exercises with Tenryuu Tatsuta and Kako in the Bungo Suido. This leisurely life is soon interrupted by the American Operation Watchtower  the invasion of Guadalcanal on  August . She then departs the Moewe Passage through the Slot together with Choukai Tenryuu Yuubari and Yuunagi creating what we know as Mikawa Kantai. Thanks to Aobas floatplane scout reporting  battleship  auxiliary carrier  cruisers  destroyers and  transports off Lunga Point Mikawa knows that the Allied forces are divided and that he can deal with them separately. On  August  Aobas first surface action takes place a battle known as the Battle of Savo Island.  With the Allied vessels unaware of Mikawas presence their commanders either asleep or away from the field the stage was set for the most humiliating defeat ever inflicted upon the United States Navy. Mikawas fleet slipped past patrolling destroyers at the mouth of the Ironbottom Sound and soon encountered the southern group of the Allied warships. Two heavy cruisers USS Chicago and HMAS Canberra and  destroyers. True to the doctrine Mikawa ordered torpedoes launched and then followed up with a barrage of .cm and .cm shells. Canberra was wrecked to a sinking hulk before she was aware that the battle has begun. Chicago did only slightly better not sinking but never properly getting into action not even alerting the northern force of Mikawas presence. Barely  minutes later curving northward around Savos eastern shore the Japanese discovered unalerted northern force still steaming in a box patrol pattern. In the early exchange Mikawas forces were divided and by chance enveloped the enemy from two sides. This resulted in a devastating crossfile quickly reducing  heavy cruisersVincennes Quincy and Astoria to sinking hulks. At this point Mikawa commits an important strategic mistake which can however be faulted to insufficient air reconnaissance. With Allied transport anchorage laying open behind him the admiral unaware that the US carriers had been withdrawn from the area orders a retirement. it was close to  hours and an attack on the anchorage would have added nearly  hours to the operation endangering the fleet to the potential air attack which as we know would not come at the dawnbreak around . Furthermore Mikawa had no idea what Allied warships remained in the Sound. Ironically Kako was sunk by the American submarine S when approaching the safety of Kavieng.Upcoming days were rather lax for Aoba. After her Choukais Kinugasas Furutakas and Yuras floatplanes bombed Lunga Point on the night of  August  she stayed in readiness at Kieta for a month until  October when CruDiv reunited at Shortland and  days later sortied towards Guadalcanal assisted by Fubuki and Hatsuyuki. The mission provite cover for a troop reinforcement convoy by shelling Henderson Field. The resulting encounter is known under the name of the Battle of Cape Esperance. On  October US task force commanded by Rear Admiral Norman Scott was standing off the entrance to the the Sound screening it from any intrusion by Japanese bombardment forces. Aware of US inferior night tactics Scott decided to make things simple. Staying in the line ahead formation using destroyers to illuminate targets and cruisers to wreck havoc. And some havoc they could wreck. His choice of the flagship however wasnt the best because while San Francisco sported more powerful armaments she also had an inferior radar. This caused him to distrust information from Helena who spotted Aobas force at  hours first executing a  degree turnabout and then closing the range to perilous proximity before opening fire. This resulted in the destroyers falling out of formation and landing between both fighting forces. Despite being taken by surprise the Japanese quickly realized that their T had been crossed and executed individual turns to port and starboard to clear the area. Aoba was hit pretty hard early on with Admiral Goto mortally wounded. Seeing Aoba in peril Furutaka swerved to position herself between her flagship and the American force getting sunk as a result. Fubuki in the vanguard was also quickly gunned down and no amount of ganbarimasu could help her. Japanese on the other hand did ganbarimasu to flee back up the Slot with US warships breaking off the pursuit at  hours. The night was a tactical victory for the USN although considering numerical advantage the element of surprise and superior tactical position they should have had inflicted much heavier casualties. On the strategic level however the victory did nothing to dissuade the Americans from their idiotic linear lineahead tactics which would bit them in the ass in the later fights.With only Aoba and Kinugasa left CruDiv receives temporary repairs at Shortland and departs for Truk where our beloved reporter is inspected by Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku. A week later Aoba arrives at Kure for repairs and refit. On  November her captain is reassigned as commanding officer of Nagato. Aoba also received a  new toy namely her  turret is removed covered over with steel plates over which a T triple mm AA mount is fitted. After a few changes of command and traveling around the Pacific gathering more material for her book. On  April while moored at Moewe anchorage Boeing B Flying Fortresses attack Aoba with skipbombing. A direct hit explodes  Long Lances stored aboard and sets the ship on fire while machine guns strafe her decks. Aobas crew is assisted by Hatsuzuki in the firefighting. In the end Aobas flooded and beached to avoid sinking. On  April Aobas towed to Truk by Sendai where Akashi repairs her over the next  months. After the repairs Aoba goes back to Kure where she arrived on  August  to get a sparkling new .cm  turret in place of the  mm AA mount. In addition she received a T air radar and  T twin mm AA guns. Unfortunately her speed is now reduced to kn due to partially irrepairable engine damage.Afterwards her transporting career starts meeting girls like Ashigara Kuma Kinu or Kitakami. On  February  Aobas attached to the CruDiv and becomes the flagship of the Rear Admiral Sakonjo Naomaso funny name. On  March the Indian Ocean Raids begin and Aoba goes Orelling... I mean commerce raiding together with Tone Chikuma and Uranami. On  March Admiral Naomaso gives an order to dispose of the POWs aboard Tone taken in the last several days.  of them are beheaded and Tone will now be known as the Murder Ship. On  April  Aoba departs Singapore with Ooi Kinu Amagiri and  other destroyers carrying ammunition to Tarakan. Continuing her transport and escort duties Aobas commanding officer changes again. On  June she is unsuccessfully attacked by B bombers. Her action report states that  Bs attacked on the bow and  from  degrees to port. The action lasted for an hour with no damage taken no aircraft shot down and  main battery and  H.A. guns rounds used. Less than a month later she receives another refit at Singapore. While drydocked her AA suite is increased by  triple and  single T mm AA guns. In addition she receives T surface radar. As a result of working together for too long Kinu and Aoba get very close and collied on  October . Light damage taken.  days later she was torpedoed by a submarine USS Bream. Out of  fired torpedoes  hits Aobas No.  engine room causing her to take  degree list to starboard. She is the towed to Cavite Navy Yard by Kitagami.Her life since then was full of submarines and aircraft but none managed to damage the veteran vessel however the damage from Breams torpedoes is still unrepaired and Aobas ordered back to Japan where she arrives on  December. In Kure her damage is deemed irreparable and shes rerated as a reserve ship. On  April  Aoba was further damaged by bombing and settled on the shallow bottom of the Kure harbour. Instead of repairing her four additional twin T mm AA guns were mounted bringing the total number to  barrels  for comparison Maya sported  barrels. Aobas rerated as a floating antiaircraft battery. On  July   aircraft from TF attack Kure and bomb Aoba again. At  hours Aoba settled to the bottom in .m of water.  days later another attack came by  TF aircraft. Four more bomb hits set her on fire which attracted B Liberator bombers hitting her with  more kg bombs breaking off the stern. She was removed from the Navy List on  November .She hosted Unno Juuza a novelist considered the father of Japanese scifi working as a war correspondent at the time. This is the reason she acts like a journalist and is always snooping around for the next story and often mentions collecting material. Sano Shouichi the real name of Juuzasan wrote a great number of his novels during the Pacific War. Japans defeat was a hard blow and he spent last four years of his life in a deeply prostrated state dying at the age of  on  May . His work was influenced by that of Nikola Tesla and Space Battleship Yamatos captain Okita Juuzo was named in his honour.Her night attack line translating to Searching barrages torpedoes  leave them all to me! refers to the battle of Savo Island where she performed all three with great effects. May also refer to how she served in multiple roles during the war from transport to combat vessel to floating AA battery. ,kancolle,deh758j,8,t5_2yjji

11424205,0,t1_dfqo1cq,.In all seriousness though it all depends on your headcanon. Mine is that all combatants are roughly the same size humanoid with Princesses usually having huge rigs to give them resilence and firepower. Nonhumanoid Abyssals vary for example I like the animes idea of making DDs the size of killer whales. Id say CVLs are shorter than humans due to that caparacething weighing them down but at the same time much much more beefy.As for the origin I like to think Abyssals we fight are mere pawnspuppets of some greater force quite possibly of extraterrestrial origin. ,kancolle,dfqx7h0,1,t5_2yjji

You might need to sacrifice farming if you want to full clear hard though so that decision is up to you.You have a lot of leveling goals but I would focus on the ones that look like you are trying to hit DDs to OASW level and maybe throw on some more slow BBs incase they can actually be used without penalty. Equipment is fine too ill give you the recommendation ive been giving if you are comfortable spending the resources I would go for at least  more LBAS bombers with  and CV flagship with daily crafts. Get one more AP shell to  since there are possible scenarios where  can be used. Other screws should go towards some of the midgame upgrades like numbered .cm to  and Proto .cm to .Find as much time as possible to run expedition  for buckets.Good Luck!,kancolle,dg608dx,1,t5_2yjji

So if the event happens to lock out all of them which is unlikely for a medium scaled event then youll be forced to drop to medium.With only  LBAS bombers and neither of them being named squadrons yourre going to have problems on maps that rely heavily on them. T LBAS is pretty garbage until you convert it to the T LBAS. To compensate try to get more Ryuusei Kais. The lack of LBAS bombers will force you to use then in LBAS and then have your carriers use the weaker bombers which is what you wouldnt want happening.I guess thats about it most of your girls are  and above and you have your equipment upgrade plans laid out properly.,kancolle,dgtakg4,1,t5_2yjji

11781876,0,t1_dgvhwwh,Well the simple answer would be nothing is too interesting about PT boats themselves but when put in a game mode alongside other large ships and planes the potential is there.Regarding the speed  vs range problem I think this can be solved by having PT boats and smaller vessels spawn closer to the enemy fleet.What Im imagining is something like having large ships shell each other from a distance while smaller vessels fight each other for superiority to deliver torpedoes to the enemy fleet. Eventually the large ships will have to deal with the small vessels as they close in and this would give the friendly large ships a chance to move closer towards the objective or something idk. All the while planes are taking off from their carriers to attack enemy carriers while the enemy escorting destroyers and cruisers defend them with antiair fire. Am I the only one who thinks that sounds cool as hell?I think its not great to decide what you think Naval forces will look like based on the handful of alpha tests they had recently. Im sure they were more about testing ship mechanics like damage and stuff more than anything. Also regarding dev diaries you and I both know that Gaijin can say one thing today and make a complete  tomorrow so I really dont put much weight on those. I know were a long way off from this and Im not gonna be the one to say what should and shouldnt be in the game but all I can say is this can really be great. ,kancolle,dgvii38,1,t5_2yjji
