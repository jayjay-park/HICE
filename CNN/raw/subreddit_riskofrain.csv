8094,0,t3_1u7rvf,yeah Bandit Bandit is the name of the game. I too think that making it piercing albeit at the cost of losing some damage perhaps would be the easiest solution. But then again it might let a Bandit spam his R all day long once he gets a few rounds off so thats worrisome too. Or make his E so that any target he attacks while invisible thus breaking the invisibility is stunned? Right now I believe only the entities in his immediate vicinity are stunned and nothing else. That really undermines its purpose as an escape tool. ,riskofrain,cefcw16,1,t5_2wi6h

I would put him below enforcer as a solo.What are you talking about? Characters like the Commando cant afford to use their normal attack on crowds but the Snipers activates so quickly that he can use it after every jump and do much more damage than the Commando.

2420443,0,t3_2n6kzz,Nice question. I was coming here to post my four RoR wishes in a text post so I may as well do it here.. A way of keeping track of how far youve got with each character. Now something like this may exist that I simply havent found but when Im starting a new game Id love to be able to see which characters Id finished the game with which I hadnt got past the first level with etc. It would add more replay value to the game because you would want to finish the game with as many characters as possible.. A random character button at start. I often forget about some characters especially if Ive unlocked a couple in short succession. Random character would have a chance of throwing up a character Id totally forgot to use for me its HAND. You could take this further and have a random artifacts button too!. More variety in the Providence fight. I love the Gilded Wurms but now that Ive got all Providences attacks and stages down once I reach the boss Im pretty sure I can win. I think it would be cool if there were a few more stages you might face. There would still be three stages to the battle but those three might be different. I dont have any suggestions but it would make the final fight more tense and interesting. Even if just the middle stage was something random like a few different potential epic creatures or something that would be really cool.. This is going to be controversial but here goes Id love an artifact that gave you an extra use item slot. I think having two use items could open up whole new tranches of tactics. Some combinations would be a lot of fun and add almost as much replayability as the artifacts themselves. Obviously it would have the potential to be quite OP but hey weve got Command right? It seems like the Hopoo attitude is if you dont like it just dont use it.Maybe it could be obtained by completing the game with a certain number of characters as per my first point.Anyway I think having two use slots would be a whole lot of fun.,riskofrain,cmavj65,3,t5_2wi6h

2842710,0,t3_2smq47,With the update to GameMaker Studio and the inclusion of shaders the games requirements have inadvertently changed. There are various shader models which determine what the graphics cardunit is able to recognize and support. I wrote about this recently and it seems you have the same issue. Ive looked up the specifications of the Radeon X and it seems to only support up to Pixel Shader .b. Based on what I see in the fragmentpixel shader code for the game youll probably need at least Pixel Shader . for it to compile on your computer.There are some workarounds when available like disabling shaders entirely an option I dont see here using fallback shadersmodes to support older hardware which dont seem to be available? or updating the shader the paletteswapping shader in question uses  constant float registers on its own for instance.In lieu of having fallback modesshaders since those need developer intervention you could try running in windowed mode fullscreen perhaps with the graphics setting on low graphics to see if that toggles something. Since the game doesnt even start for you youd have to modify Prefs.ini manually.

3940876,0,t3_35lgui, Learn the maps. Once you learn the different configurations it becomes much easier to move through them efficiently. This comes with time and practice. Jump a lot. Many attacks can only hit you if you are on the ground. This is especially true for bosses jump just before colossus smash magma worm dive etc. Keep in mind that enemies tend to spawn close to you. You need to spread out the spawns otherwise you get an impenetrable deathball in one location. That being said moving around a lot wastes time  you have to balance efficiency with survival.Hope this helps! Good luck and have fun!,riskofrain,cr5hs1r,20,t5_2wi6h

7237729,0,t3_4eium3,Jar of Souls is my favourite! When you have played for a while you just use the item and ALL mobs in your field of view creates a ghost and they start killing each other! Its especially use full if you combine it with other items such as Monster Tooth. You can use it as a way to regenerate your health! ,riskofrain,d20vlgf,4,t5_2wi6h
7318986,0,t3_4ett2p,On one hand yes it is hard. The time  difficulty seems like a neat gimmick when you first hear about it but then when you actually play the game you underestimate it and you take too long to make it through the first  or  levels and you reach a tipping point where the game becomes harder than you are equipped to handle. You have to learn to play it quickly while you gather items as effectively as you can.    Each character has  useful skills. Use them all. Each character has a synergy between their skills that underlies their whole design. The Commando is good at dodge rolling through crowds of enemies to stall while his other abilities recharge and then he can stun an angry mob and repeat the process. The Miner is good at getting into crowds moving them to where you want them and then stunlocking multiple mobs with Crush as you hop around.    One thing to keep in mind is that the game can really be beaten in like  minutes if youre really fast about it. Its made to be actionpacked and full of interesting things to find so you can afford to try something new die and then jump back in with a relatively quick turnaround. Experiment and get a feel for the way the game is built.    I hope these help! Good luck!,riskofrain,d2a4a3m,2,t5_2wi6h

9872486,0,t3_5gqqct,Practically you dont. Multiplayer in this game is usually done through a program that creates a server and all involved parties must have it. It is annoying and complicated but super fun. Look online there are plenty of tutorials.As per the rando part you can probably find people to play with on this subreddit as well as people who will help you set it up. Unfortunately though no easily usable instant multiplayer is in the game not is it likely that there ever will be. At least on PC not sure about ps.,riskofrain,dauepp7,3,t5_2wi6h
10166446,0,t1_dbwdfxi,I suspect it probably is the first run. You can clearly see that this run was done on Drizzle and the unlocks include Gasoline and Bandit. Thats pretty consistent with what Id expect from a first run in terms of unlocks  Its also fairly consistent with a new player who didnt know to push Q to teleport to the last level and then proceeds to get rekt by a sand crab.It is without question a good first run but not so good that it should call OPs honesty  game experience in to question.,riskofrain,dbwf863,12,t5_2wi6h
