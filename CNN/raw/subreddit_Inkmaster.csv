7179780,0,t3_4dsnh5,I currently have Anthony and Sausage as the final  with Anthony winning. Anthony consistently performs well in both elimination tattoos and flash challenges. He remains cool and gamefocused while others get into drama. I think others may see him as a threat and give him hard canvases but he has the skill and composure to keep crushing it.I thought Cleen was going to be the clear frontrunner this season but hes been kind of slacking. I think hes more focused on being a good TV character than making winnercaliber designs. I had Megan as potential final  until she almost quit last episode. The judges arent going to just forget about that and I dont see how they award her the win or even an opportunity to create a finale piece at this point. ,Inkmaster,d1u9z0n,3,t5_310al
