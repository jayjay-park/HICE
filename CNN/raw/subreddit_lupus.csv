198610,0,t3_1wa95n,In the three years that I have had lupus I have learned very quickly to walk into the doctors office with very low expectations. Even with doctors that I like  make the goal for that day to just get all your questions in and have them listen to you. Huge diagnoses or even just getting a doctor to change their mind about what you may have can take several visits. I am not saying this because I agree with your doctor by the way just by experience  if I get too excited about going to the doctor and possibly getting a diagnosis or new medicine to ease my symptoms Im just going to get really really frustrated and stressed out when it doesnt happen. That only exacerbates my health problems. I totally feel your frustration and understand what it feels like to be belittled. Definitely look for a new doctor one that doesnt dismiss things that you bring up yourself  people who have systemic conditions and do lots of research are actually VERY good at diagnosing themselves and knowing what is going on with their body  sometimes even better than the doctor. Many doctors are opposed to this and you can see it in their eyes when you say I think I might have x or whatever. Supposedly we are supposed to just rattle of our symptoms and say Whats wrong with me doc?? and not do any research online or talk to anyone else who actually has the disease. And then they will try to school you about how oh you cant trust everything you see online! like we are  years old or something. Anyways that turned into a little bit of a rant but I wish you good luck on your journey! Remember that a faster diagnosis might only happen if your disease progresses faster so a slow diagnosis might be a good sign. I have been stuck with the diagnosis of Lupuslike autoimmune disease for several years now but being on plaquenil I havent made any sharp declines in health so in the long run I cant complain too much.,lupus,cf12bcv,2,t5_2rtve

1335003,0,t1_cijebpy,Yeah its definitely possible its something else. Id be surprised if it wasnt lupus but you never know!I had never heard of autoimmune disorders before my results. Its kind of scary to hear about maybe having something youve never heard of you dont really know how to gauge your reaction. Based on my symptoms and my pain my doctor thinks its a connective tissue disorder. So she just wrote down some of the names of the ones that I would most likely have based on my symptoms so I could look them up and get a better understanding of what I might be dealing with. Because I had to wait six months for my appointment and Id be freaking out unless I had something to look at and get more information about.

Even if I had to take lots of breaks I usually felt a little better after moving around for a bit. For cardio I switched from Zumba to using an elliptical and that was SO much easier on my joints which was great since arthritis is one of my major symptoms.Lots and lots of stretching before and after working out helped tremendously with the muscle pain and stiffness. I didnt have issues with numbness so Id say to definitely take it easy with free weights but I think exercising is really beneficial for most with lupus.,lupus,cjzyhcz,2,t5_2rtve

I took whatever I had on hand atm some pain killers muscle relaxers half a bottle of jack...I was really desperate to stop hurting. All that ended up happening was I then got to feel completely sick and in terrible pain. I asked my rheumy later about why they didnt work and she told me that because its an inflammation the only thing that brings it down.

2600552,0,t1_cmw6c2z,Thank you so much for replying. Im so sorry your boyfriend didnt understand thats awful he didnt support you. Its not our fault we got Lupus I cant believe some people that hate us specifically because we can be more exhausted get sicker more easily be in pain practically everyday and people make our life so much harder by not being supportive. Lupus does suck so bad. I hate it. I have had it since I was  yrs old so  years now. Yeah I have heard others tell me that too. I thought I would come here for a perspective from people that are more like me since my healthy friends dont fully understand how I feel.My boyfriend has improved with understanding but I still feel he doesnt do much to shut his family up about being so awful towards me? Hell either do nothing or cover up what they said or tell me I am thinking something else and Im confused. How do you cope with being alone? If I get left alone for more than an hour I start getting extremely depressed and I think bad thoughts.

Everything everyone else has said was mostly true for me on the times Ive been on prednisone currently in the hospital now just got diagnosed lupus nephritis today in addition to sle and your dose is really low so you shouldnt have that much trouble with it. Im currently on  mg a day and the most annoying symptom is the hunger its crazy. But one symptom I havent seen anyone mention is make sure you take it in the morning!! If I take it after  am I will not be able to sleep until well past my bedtime. It will make you feel so wired so be sure it to take it as early in the morning as possible.

Then Id still be falling asleep anytime I sat down.Mouth ulcers are definitely one of the markers of lupus.  When I got my diagnosis I had  of them.  I didnt eat anything real for weeks .. Just jello and ice cream because I could let it melt and slide down my throat.  Your GP will not likely give you a diagnosis but will send you to a rheumatologist.  Id start researching one now  it can take forever to get an appointment with a rheumy!I saw my GP on  and he said it looks like lupus go see a rheum.  He also have me a referral to one but they werent covered by my insurance.  I called around.  One didnt ever all me back several were between  months out for appointments.

You may be fine in the sun but eating a certain diet will be difficult for you or not getting a full night sleep or not exercising enough or not taking certain meds etc. My doctor prescribed me fioricet for headaches which are a god send. I had a terrible thisfeelslikeahorriblemigrainebutImnotgettinganauraandnomedicineisworking headache that lasted for days. He called in for a prescription of this and it knocked it out immediately.  There are good days and bad days. You know your body the best. Sometimes the most overwhelming thing is hearing from wellminded people what you can or cant do.  From what I understand pain from lupus is generally from arthritis whereas fibro presents more allover and muscular. Lupus pain generally shows up in blood work as inflammation. Ask what the plan for medication is. Prednisone may be what you go with long term but its a pretty terrible drug. My rheumatologist and I use it as a knockout drug If a flare starts coming on Ill do a three week taper starting at mg to stop it in its tracks but its not a long term solution for me. Definitely ask about your headaches. Pick your worst symptoms and ask what you can do to help them. Also  any symptoms that present visually be sure to take a picture of.

9194630,0,t1_d8hg6un,The thing is that in the end you cannot force someone to get support or therapy and that includes forcing someone into a mental hospital. She may just ride out the stay and then revert into her previous behavior because quite honestly she has a disease thats going to kill her anyway if she doesnt take care of herself so if she is truly and actually suicidal she can kill herself most easily than anyone. And any of us here with lupus know that. Ive had pulmonary embolism twice myself and know really easily that if I stop injecting my lovenox I could quite easily die in a short period of time. I dont enjoy playing russian roulette though. If I were you Id have a very serious talk with your cousin and sit down and say something like This pattern of behavior is very self destructive and I am worried about you. However I cant live your life for you and I urge you to get help. Id like you to think about it and to decide what you want your future actions to be and how I can support you best. However I need you to be the one who makes the choices. If you do not decide to get help I cant be the one to support you further.Right now it sounds like you are in the role of an enabler and a lot of alcoholics put someone in this role. While your intentions may be good on the one hand youre expecting her to change while coming to this support group and trying to force her into action on the other. Not only is it betraying her trust I doubt its going to have the expected result you want in the end. Right now it sounds like shes got a lot of fears and isnt facing them. Its easier to run away. If you have a long and serious talk about how she can really die and it can sneak up on her if she does not face these issues but if she seeks help it can get easier and youd like to help her but the parameters of this help are X and Y she might listen. And then stick to those parameters. You deserve this too. Its true that lupus is a tough disease but to tell the truth most diseases are tough and many things in life are tough also. She has to make a choice at some point and you cant make it for her. I would also not post a lot of personal details in this group in case she ever finds it later. The reason your post was offensive is because it does come across as gossipy and Im glad you can see that. Your comment that suicidal ideation and intent are not uncommon in lupus patients can actually be interpreted as offensive too I dont know whats going on with your cousin but we dont actually see comments about suicidal ideation on this message board nor discussion of this type of thing. Yes it is difficult being diagnosed with a chronic illness but the alcoholism is probably contributing to this more and your cousin may also have depression as well which isnt always present with lupus nor is alcoholism. Of course all combinations are possible. Its possible she began drinking to help with sleep which is often impaired by the types of medications we are put on to help control the lupus especially high doses of prednisone. If she wants to start addressing these issues finding a support group for the alcoholism and the depression is probably a better way to address this rather than one for the lupus there isnt going to be a huge amount of crossover with this. And as I said before you cannot force her to face these issues she has to decide to do it herself. ,lupus,d8hhjqu,-4,t5_2rtve

10044164,0,t1_dbgbn42,Its been almost  years since I switched back so Im trying to remember. I do remember turkey in particular made me flare. And I remember saying red meat caused flares but I cant remember any specific instance. But again it was probably the grain vs grass issue. I was also a pretty bad vegetarian but I wasnt strict with myself. If I had an urge for a steak I would go buy myself one. Life is too short. One thing that noticably made a difference in my blood work was adding a quality Omega  supplement. I started going to an Integrative Medicine specialist at OSU and she recommended Omega  vitamin B and D calcium and magnesium. The weird thing was I didnt FEEL much better. I felt like the fish oil caused low level flares. But when I went in for my quarterly blood work it was considerably better.  My rheumatologist asked what I was doing differently and agreed that fish oil can be helpful. In hindsight I think the dosage the IM recommended was too high.  Its such a weird disease. There seems to be no rhyme or reason and therefore very little control. Just stay very tuned to your body remove what you can but dont hesitate to indulge from time to time. Its not worth all the work if youre feeling miserable and deprived. ,lupus,dbgs3q2,1,t5_2rtve

10226029,0,t3_5k4xt6,Lupus is a progressive disease. You should go to your doctor. And yes there are different degrees of lupus. Mild moderate and severe. Also lupus could be attacking your organs without showing any outright symptoms. You really should go to your doctor.,lupus,dc36ejj,1,t5_2rtve
10315026,0,t3_5no85p,It can take a while before the benefits of Cellcept are seen but it seems to vary from person to person. Ive been on Cellcept for the past almost five years excluding the time I underwent chemo treatment and have had very few problems on it but this will obviously be different for everyone. Initially I had some abdominal pain but that isnt really much of an issue anymore. The one thing that Ive really tried to be more diligent about now since being put on Cellcept is getting my yearly flu shot.,lupus,dcd9j6l,3,t5_2rtve
10378244,0,t3_5oatah,I was working as a manager of a preschool right out of college  I agree with usparrow the germs were brutal and I was beyond exhausted! And I wasnt even working directly with the kids.  Now working as a fundraiser for a large social services nonprofit. Its x better. Demanding work but so worth it because I get to give back while still saving a lot of energy in a  office setting! I highly recommend looking into it. I started off in nursing school in college and also realized how big a toll it was taking on my body. Let me know if you have any questions!,lupus,dckfrsu,1,t5_2rtve
10387855,0,t1_dcl5yi3,Thanks for all the info! What do you mean by cancellation spot?Well the thing is my symptoms have been things I experienced all my life which all seemed pretty normal to me. So how do I tell which ones are actually symptoms and which ones are just random normal things? Like for the mouth uclers I get them often but I usually just associate it with maybe I ate something too sweet or tangy the day before and they go away untreated after a few days. So is that an actual symptom or is it just an imbalance in my diet? Same for everything else my hands hurt randomly throughout the day nothing really sets it off but after a quick massage the pain goes away. So what exactly defines a real symptom? I have a personal friend with lupus that I talked to a long time ago when his started flaring up about how his became so bad he has a life expectancy of a few years unless he gets a new kidney. He told me if he found the diagnosis earlier on he wouldnt have nearly as many issues as he does now. Thats why I want to do this as fast as possible but Im not sure if the doctor really hasnt seen the results or maybe she just doesnt want to be the bearer of bad news or maybe it is just nothing so shes not wanting to prioritize it. My xrays came in today chest is clear but the spine xray says FINDINGSFracture None.Asymmetric appearance of the atlantoaxial alignment with increased distance betweenthe odontoid and the C lateral mass on the right upper to  mm while on the left is only mm.Prevertebral soft tissue Unremarkable.IMPRESSIONAbnormal atlantoaxial alignment that may be positional.  I have no idea what any of that means but a quick google search said the abnormal atlantoxial can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis but my rheumatoid factor is low? So its just all very confusing ,lupus,dclj0z8,1,t5_2rtve

11363959,0,t3_5zsw2k,Hello  in a similar situation to yours and Ive found two things that have helped keep steroidrelated weight gain at bay.  Brisk morning walks for around  mins before youve had your first meal for the day. Something about exercising in that fasted state that really seems to rev up your metabolism for the rest of the day.  Lowimpact cardiotoning exercises. These are especially helpful if you feel achey doing any heavy duty gym stuff or anything that involves machines and a whole lot of equipment. Id recommend the lowimpact workouts by the channel FitnessBlender on YouTube. Makes you feel like youve worked your body but not overlyexerted it. I hope this helps you! Dont get discouraged by steroidal weight gain  many have experienced it but also found ways to lose the weight slowly but surely!,lupus,dfk305a,2,t5_2rtve
11472176,0,t3_63odes,While no one wants to be in this club its nice to have people to lean on and discuss symptoms and treatments with.My diagnosis flip flipped between lupus RA and CREST before the doctor settled on lupus. It was sorta crazy. By the time I received the final diagnosis Id been through multiple meds and started Benlysta right away.As far as handling it its had ups and downs. I was in remission for a few years and I maximized my freedom then. It was a spontaneous remission before I was on meds. It was great but about five years I had a flare and it has consistently built with a vengeance. Its also been hard to accept that I need a limited schedule. I really hate that but when I push myself everything breaks down.,lupus,dfwd6k9,2,t5_2rtve
11660991,0,t3_66cvru,I dont think theres any way to know that other than testing. They say if you have one ai disease youll likely end up with multiple. Im sorry this is happening to you. Definitely call your doc ASAP. ,lupus,dghsds3,3,t5_2rtve
