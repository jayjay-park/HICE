4607301,0,t1_ctb85hc,You guys are right this makes a lot of sense.  I think sending the deck lists to a designated ref thats not part of the casting crew before the matches is a fair option. ,bloodstone,ctbc1qn,4,t5_37yxd
4686260,0,t1_ctl6o90,Thats a really great idea about highlights and showcasing the players behind the cards. If youre interested Id be happy to get you into some practice casts. Id really like to get an EST presence . Its hard working full time in the PST timezone. I can rarely cast during the week unless its evening PST. ,bloodstone,ctl8xsi,2,t5_37yxd

4940273,0,t1_cuh1ii7,Yea I had intended the formatting to be changed to the usual style. This match was kinda confusing we played  games then Farva was called back to work so we had to suspend for a few hours. When we came back we had to get a different ref so our original ref wanted to be as detailed as possible to make sure we didnt alter decks for the final match. I should have mentioned the formatting should have been consistent in the final post.,bloodstone,cuh9eex,1,t5_37yxd
4975916,0,t1_culbrlg,I agree. Just looking at the first teams go at it Im discovering new rules that completely mess up the strategies we were trying to establish for our games...There needs to be a clear CENTRAL thread or page on the website with ALL the infos that would serve as a reference for everyone. We shouldnt have to look at  threads to assemble all the pieces of relevant info for the league.,bloodstone,culr1zc,2,t5_37yxd
