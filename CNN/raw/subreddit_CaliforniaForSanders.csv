4890957,0,t1_cuawt13,The stipulation allowing DTS voters is written in the California Democratic Party bylaws.  The mechanism by which bylaws can be changed requires review and approval of the CDP Rules Committee at a meeting preceding the vote in which a bylaw change is to be voted on.  There is only one meeting between now and the primary so it is impossible for the bylaws to be changed before the primary.That means that the CDP will keep the primary open to NPP voters.  ,CaliforniaForSanders,cub1lkb,1,t5_380yr

5288220,0,t3_3n7ubj,Criticism is great for improvement! Obamacare is great but it needs improvement like being able to cover everybody we had about  million uninsured people before Obamacare now its around  milllion but Id like to see it at . Most liberalsdemocrats and a good amount of republicans are for a single payer system. This would bring the cost over  years in which we spend  trillion dollars on health caremost of this going to big private insurance companies to  trillion and some speculate it could cost even less than that! This is a huge savings for the economy. This is why liberals support a single payer system but idiots all across this country vote for people who are against their own interests. The people just keep voting in representatives who are destroying our economy and not working to pass progressive laws such as universalsingle payer health care.The th and th congress has been voted one of the most unproductive congresses in history and its the first big republican majority since  right before the recession. NOT A BIG SUPRISE!

6053152,0,t1_cycz24s,I know.  Its confusing because the answer isnt set in stone yet As it stands right now you need to be registered as a Democrat or No Party Affiliation.  The Democratic party has to inform the CA Sec of State  days before the primary if they are going to stay the course and follow their ByLaws or change it to only allow registered Democrats.  You have  days before the Primary to register to vote and select your party.,CaliforniaForSanders,cyd2hai,1,t5_380yr

7189894,0,t1_d1un8te,I think youd be surprised how moderate the electorate is.  Sure a lot of progressive issues poll well in a vacuum but actual applied progressive policy often isnt well received.  As recently as  a year with HUGE Democratic turnout voters in California passed Prop .  In  marijuana legalization failed in California.  I know ballot initiatives arent the best measure of the political climate but I think they help show that even in liberal California voters are more moderate than you might believe.  If you were to build a robot and programmed it to model mainstream Democrats it would look an awful lot like Hillary Clinton a recent advocate for same sex marriage business friendly interested in incremental progress maybe not in favor of drug legalization etc.  A lot of people have heard Bernies message and have supported his ideas.  Hes reaching a lot of liberal Democrats and independent voters many of whom typically dont vote and hes generating a very vocal base of support. What he has struggled to do though is generate a lot of support from mainstream Democrats.  In particular Bernie is struggling with minorities and older people.  Hispanics and older people tend to be a little more conservative particularly when it comes to social issues and may not be interested in a lot of the bold changes Bernie wants to make.  Saying that Bernie wants to legalize marijuana or that he has been a lifetime supporter of LGBT rights may be popular in downtown San Francisco or on a UC campus but that message would not be well received by a lot of Hispanic families in Merced.  Further a lot of people are afraid at the idea of raising taxes and its incredibly hard to get past the charge of well he wants to raise taxes. It doesnt matter if its a net benefit for families it doesnt matter if its not even a tax increase that involves them raising or otherwise increasing the size of government programs isnt something a lot of people respond well to  even many Democrats.  The last point that a lot of people dont understand when it comes to Hillary support is that a lot of people still see her as having a better chance of beating bigbadTrump.  It doesnt matter if Bernie actually does better in headtohead polling which actually means very little at this point in the race a lot of people have seen the power of institutional support and Hillary has a ton of that.  Bernie is still seen by many as a gamble while Hillary is more of a known commodity.    ,CaliforniaForSanders,d1vfhja,1,t5_380yr

7829317,0,t1_d3w0v9j,I think you are underestimating the importance of this.  Having people smashing eggs on people and throwing rocks at Trump supporters while chanting Bernie is not only terrible for the campaign but it is terrible for liberalism in general.  The entire progressive movement is being made to look like an intolerant mob.  It is ALWAYS more effective for members of a group who selfidentify as liberals to stand up to others in the group when they are out of line.  More importantly than all this is that its honestly an injustice to let people assault Trump supporters in Bernies name.  Its putting peoples lives at risk and its slandering Bernies name at the same time by associating him with the violence.  Protesting the violence at the rallies is a more real action for change and would create a better public image than any amount of phone banking would.,CaliforniaForSanders,d3w2yvk,1,t5_380yr
