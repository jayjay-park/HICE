Look into these elements when designing a home especially in a cold climate like Minnesota.  There is also the Passivhaus standard.  Look at your current utility bills.  Do you spend more on heat gas or electricity?  My guess is heat gas.  Theres a bit more upfront cost but youll immediately save money.

764618,0,t3_22w9cs,My husband and I did this. We are smalltown people who lived outside of a city for years hated it despite having good jobs and left. We moved to be closer to my family where the nearest WalMart is a  minute drive away.   We did everything wrong. We put our house on the market and the very next day the newspaper headlines read Housing Bubble Bursts! Prices Plummet that really happened. We did not have enough money saved. We assumed our house would go on the market and be sold within a month. We were SURE of it so we had no plan in case it didnt. We had no jobs lined up in our new area. We had  huge dogs and a cat which narrowed down our housing options drastically as almost no apartments nowadays allow pets much less  huge ones.   It took some time for us to recover from the slew of stupid mistakes we made. However we have never been happier even during the no money  big bills phase. Life here is so much slower. We no longer have to spend  hours of each day raging in traffic. My husband found a job he loves and my little service business is chugging along nicely and growing every year.    We finally saved up a few bucks to buy some acreage to build on. We had assumed that houses in a rural area would be cheap but we were wrong. The houses are depressingly expensive. We will NOT ever EVER buy a home or land in an HOA community association condo  townhome association gated or planned community or subdivision. we wont even buy into a little development of  homes where everyone just kicks in a hundred a year for snow removal. I know too much about that industry and if you want rights as a homeowner you learn to stay away from those kinds of places. So that eliminates a slew of cheaper homes for us too but those were never in the running anyway.    Now we are just trying to find our way through the maze of buying raw land to build on. Its daunting. But we can take our time and find the perfect little patch of land for us.  We chose where to live based on where my family was. If family wasnt an issue I probably would have moved somewhere that doesnt get too much snow but also isnt TOO far South. North Carolina or something. Im from the East coast so Id probably stick with it just for familiaritys sake. I love mountains so the Midwest and prairie states wouldnt be options for me. And I like being able to drive to the ocean.   It is true there are no jobs in rural areas. There are minimumwage jobs as cashiers and stuff and thats about it. For every bustling wellrun farm out here there are about  farms with buildings crumbling overgrown or unused fields and just  yearold unshaven farmers in old baseball caps and flannel coats from  just standing in their driveways or driving their massive massive old Ford pickups at  mph to the Agway. There really is nothing to do here and if youre single the dating pool is pretty much those  yearold farmers or maybe the divorced insurance guy in town. But for folks like my husband and I  who prefer watching birds in the backyard to navigating city sidewalks its perfect. Good luck!,simpleliving,cgr6y4b,5,t5_2r0za

941264,0,t3_24w9a5,A hardy pair of walkingbiking shoes sandals one pair of dress shoes winter boots depending on your region as sometimes a necessity. Keep clothing that can interchange well. Example four solid tops and four bottoms can equal many different outfits while minimizing the total number of clothing articles in your closet. Please note I just randomly chose that number. Choose what works best for you. I tend to keep clothes that are made of all natural material cottons wool etc and made sturdily. They last longer and save you in the long run from having to replace them. A lot of styles lately seem to involve rather flimsy material. Alas. Same with shoes. Keep something worth taking to get repaired when the soles are worn out instead of having to purchase new shoes for example. Its inexpensive comparatively. I have one hat for the summer one wool cap for the winter a pair of gloves and one scarf. Before this year I had tonnnnnsss of scarves gloves and caps. Simplifying it down to just the bare minimum has helped me keep my closet in order and lets me get out the door a lot quicker than before! Hope this helped a bit. ,simpleliving,chba06l,10,t5_2r0za
987055,0,t3_25dd6o,I am extremely wary of the subscription lifestyle. Im all for simple living but the key for me is simply to trim what I own down to what I truly use and enjoy and get rid of the extraneous crap. For me at least simple living dovetails with frugal living and less consumption in general. From a financial standpoint its worth noting that these rentallthethings models are typically a really poor financial decision.  Its better to simply own less and keep what you own working well for a really long time then save your money and invest it to make it grow. Whenever possible I avoid subscriptions like the plague... they siphon off income each month that could otherwise be invested and when the subscription stops youre typically left with nothing at all. A subscription lifestyle makes you a chump consumer feeding your monthly income to some innovative startups mundaneeverydaystuffasaservice business model rather than investing it in yourself so you can leave all this nonsense behind some day. For me a simple life isnt saying all my music is stored on my iTunes account or Ive digitized my library to my Kindle but rather asking whether you need all that music in the first place or whether youll really ever read those  books you bought on sale in the Kindle store as if libraries didnt exist.,simpleliving,chghi15,38,t5_2r0za

I cant find it now.I realized that the process would never be perfect and that I might make some mistakes. Maybe Ill throw away something Ill have to buy again later. But I realize the cost of making mistakes is less than the cost of being weighted down with stuff the next several years of my life. Heres how you begin get a two big boxes and put them near the door. In one box start putting things you want to go to Goodwill and in another box start putting stuff you want to sell. Whenever you have an hour or so to kill start going through your piles of stuff and sorting it. See that bookcase you dont need? List it on Craigslist. Some days youll barely get anything done and some days youll feel super productive. But just try to do one little bit at a time and maybe youll start picking up momentum. The key though is to start anywhere.You dont set out to build a wall. You dont say Im going to build the biggest baddest greatest wall thats ever been built. You dont start there.

They should all be gotten rid of their purpose has already been fulfilled as they were destined to only be read through halfway or in order to satisfy your desire to purchase something. If you honestly truly need it again then you wont have any issue buying another copy but most likely youll forget it ever existed just as when you owned it. Only keep those that you reread constantly and when buying new books be certain youll read it immediately because theres a sort of mental honeymoon period and when that moment is up youre more likely to never touch it again.

Its a strange floor planned duplex so we dont have a dining room but have a x living room. Also only closets are in the two bedroms so towels are on a bookshelf in the hallway and sheets under our bed. Id expect yall would have a more normal floor plan which hopefully means more useful storage space.Before moving know the floorplan and what furniture you actually wantneedhave room for. Also hidden in plain sight storage is a godsend. We have a coffee table trunk extra toiletries and other things we dont need access to often are in there and our bed has  of clearance under it. We keep out of season clothes in two large plastic tubs and two small laundry baskets under there.Where does everyone spend the majority of their time right now at home? Figure out what types of spaces you actually need then creatively combine them. If you do bunk beds for your daughters then you will actually be able to stand in the room stooping under a loft gets old really fast. Maybe do no other furniture in there except playroom type stuff no kid really needs a dresser.Its hard to get in the downsizing mindset but it gets easier once you realize how few things you actually use regularly.

Add the link t the spreadsheat and allow that anyone can publish in to input data.After  week check if there are still people who did not complete the list go and spam on hisher chat.After  weeks you get all the contacts emails phones and so.Then delete every single like you have on facebook delete your personal data profile photo etc.Go and delete your account takes  days to be complete off of the system.My personal experience... I cut my friend list to about  people. Got their data in a spreadsheet. Only  loyal friend keep contact if there is some party they tell me call me or email. They respect my decision and do not talk to me only on fb as most of people do nowadays.I believe your case is not that severe Years ago I use to stay  hour everyday on fb. Now I dont even want to hear about this website.Good luck!ONE MORE THING IF YOU USE FB TO REGISTER IN WEBSITES INSTEAD OF LOGIN AND KEY YOU WILL NEED TO DELETE ALL THIS SITES ACCOUNTS BEFORE DELETING FACEBOOK TAKE YOUR DATA FROM IT AND THAN DELETE FACEBOOK.,simpleliving,co9sv9g,2,t5_2r0za

In order  My house computer motorcycle bicycle and my car.The house is obviouspaid off the computer was  I built it myself with custom phasechange and water cooling after a deployment.  I wont be spending that kind of cash on a pc ever again but it was a fun experience and it still keeps up with modern games just fine at a time when I cannot afford to replace anything.  The motorcycle was about the same price but has been a much better value over time.  The bicycle cost  and has been worth every penny slogging up mountain after mountain.  It really pays off going down the mountain . And the car.  I had to sell my nice Durango for a more economical POS vehicle.  Everything else I had bought when I had a job and a more active military lifestyle.

Theres just so much pressure to be with someone anyone that being single seems to be the losers choice. Its not. Sometimes its just whats needed and its better than settling for someone whos not right. Ive always figured that Id meet the right person when I was ready and the time was right so I never looked too hard.

Theres gotta be something else driving you right?Yes but what? Im thinking and pausing before writing again. In other words I dont know but Im wondering what it is right now...First thought is I dont want to settle for second best. I want to find my passion. Im a Jack of All Trades I want to do everything. But at the same time I want to find my passion and do just that as opposed to just trying things getting bored trying new things getting bored this never ending cycle. And whatever that is it will to use the variety of skills that I have. Like Im bred for it. Short answer is I dont know. Ive known for a while I want to enjoy my career. Recently I realized unless Im helping people I wont enjoy my career. As I go through life I havent realized what that career is but rather what it isnt but there are so many options that getting rid of a few dont seem to be enough. I figured it out... Peace. Im searching for peace. Though Ive build in cultural ideals like if only I get married to the right women or if only I find the right career then Ill be happy then Ill find peace. But thats not it. Ive felt peace already. Ive felt peace when Im giving of myself to help others. I dont need to do that in only one place. I dont to get married to do that. And yet I still want those things because otherwise I keep traveling looking for peace and helping people wherever I go. Though through helping them I help them find peace. Maybe not with all of life but with some of their problems. So not only do I want to find peace I want to bring it to others. Still all this is very vague and thats all Ive got to work on. However since Ill never find peace in this life besides instances of it here and there thats also what keeps me going. Im always looking for ways to make life a little better for those around me. Because of that I wont settle like many people of this world. I wont become a mindless drone that works and works just so they can feed themselves and family and buy things they dont need that wont bring them anything but fleeting happiness only to work and work again never feel complete. Im not going to settle for a mediocre life. Im going to strive for a life of happiness love joy peace and Im going to spread it to anyone and everyone I can.TLDR Peace,simpleliving,cpkjeo5,2,t5_2r0za

I was more active in my friendships and less focused on trivial stuff that a phone might distract you for. I think living without internet will give you the same benefits as me living without a phone and FB. gt Any tips on how to manage the initial shock?I didnt have any initial shock. I just realized that I had to communicate with people differently. Those that cared about me still kept in contact with me. Those that didnt faded into my past. I guess my main tip is to know what youre going to fill your new free time with. If you dont know what youre going to spend all that time energy and money on itll be easy to go back into your old habits. I know you have books you plan to read and projects to do but if you feel forced to do it it may not help either. I hope you enjoy these things as much as you enjoy what you did on the internet at home. Then living without internet at home will be something you can sustain. I suggest focusing on your top  priorities which means you may have to figure them out first. As long as youre focused on whats important to you and using your time energy and money on those things youll have a much better life internet or no internet at home. No matter how this turns out itll be a great learning experience and Im glad youre trying it out!,simpleliving,cpxfzar,3,t5_2r0za

3656413,0,t3_31m0c6,My dad left the corporate world when he changed jobs and about a month later the previous company Enronlevel exploded into a pile of ash. It shook him up and convinced him that big business was a world of fraud greed and deception and he wanted out. So he told us he was going to set out on his own and work freelance for less money and guess what? We were children and we did not give a single fuck.Your kids value time with you and your wife. They value new experiences even more than you do. My mom took us camping and to museums and parks instead of the mall or the toy store and we had a blast we didnt realize until we were much older that we couldnt afford to stay in hotels when we travelled and we only went to the museum on free days. So in a way young kids are both incredibly dumb and very enlightened. They wont figure out a lot of what you dont tell them and theyll still be happy.Of course how you raise them is also part of it. My mom never brought fashion magazines into the house because they encourage consumerism and she limited the amount of tv we could watch for the same reason in favor of family movie nights and library trips. And if you do this I think your kids will react like we did first anger then acceptance then enjoyment.,simpleliving,cq921zh,2,t5_2r0za
3666014,0,t1_cqa3ksc,By the way that story I told was  years old. CDs used to be a big thing in the s thats when I bought most of them.As for books I have a new method. I drop down to only my favorite books and books I was definitely going to read. This left me with only  books. Then my rule was once I read a book Id give it away for free to someone who wanted to read it. Then when I got done to no books Id decide if I wanted an ebook reader or not. Over  years Ive read over  books have about  books on hand and havent paid a penny or used a library. People liked my idea of giving away a good book after reading it that they gave me their books for free knowing Id read it and give it away to after. I wouldnt take a book unless I was interested so I denied taking books many times but also took many books. On top of that a few people let me borrow a book read it and return it. I dont think Ill ever get down to having no books with this method it just works. It brings up great conversations about books with people and keeps me reading. I dont like the idea of a book collecting dust. Thats a waste of a book in my mind. Though libraries do a good thing by making books available to the public for free they still have books that just collect dust. People share books even less on an ereader since you either let someone borrow your whole collection or nothing at all. I want a book to have a life of its own to be read passed on read again and again. Sitting on the shelf a books has very limited value. In a persons hands it has unlimited potential. TLDR After I read a book I give it away for free. I want books to have a life of their own not just collecting dust.,simpleliving,cqa5f96,4,t5_2r0za

But honestly I dont plan on touching that. After the Bahamas I might go to Europe and sail the Med. for awhile and see what it is like over there and take in all the history.

Many companies and now people today use the concept of just in time logistics which means you spend less time storing things and rather more money on getting what you need exactly when you need it and not a minute earlier or later.Problem is this costs extra money so it tends to favor those with money to burn.

So its wrong to say that this is good news for energy conservation because were using more energy. Energy efficiency means using less energy to achieve the same result. For example you can save energy by not running your air conditioner during the summer. Alternatively you can take measures like buying a high efficiency ac getting your ducts tested and sealed etc. to maintain the same level of summer comfort for less energy. The first is an example of conservation the latter one of efficiency. ,simpleliving,cwy8u6m,17,t5_2r0za

I help lowincome people file their taxes during tax season with the VITA program I buildrepair computers with an organization that ships them to underprivileged hospitals and schools mostly abroad and I do the occasional food shelter or educational outreach event.What kind of environment do you live in?  If youre in a city there are tons of things you can do.  You could try a website like VolunteerMatch  Another option is to just think about the kinds of work youd like to do and google around for volunteer groups like that.  Smaller towns are more limited but there are some classic things you can usually find in any town a food shelter maybe a homeless shelter Big Brothers Big Sisters H Rotary and other community organizations.  Another option is to check out the religious organizations in your area.  I know you said you arent religious but a lot of religious congregations do nonreligious volunteer work and they generally accept help from the broader community.  Or you could try finding the subreddit for your community and asking there.  Just as an aside you should know that a lot of people have the problem youre having.

My place does half an hour of foot massage keeping costs down probably. They run their knuckles up and down. Some people find it painful...

I now fully intend to live in this house for a very long time but initially bought it as a flip it still needs work and it is slightly too big for me. I always have in the back of my mind that once I finish my repairs I will rent a room but each year that passes I prefer living alone more and more. Two of my bedrooms are basically empty one is an office the other a craftartphotography room both with super minimalsimple setups. I like the space because I can host regular board game parties with lots of folding tables and chairs setup in my almost empty rooms! I did for a number of years also run a business with a lot of inventory out of those two rooms so I guess when I say it is slightly too big that is truthful but I still find ways to use the space.I get asked a lot when I intend to move and people are always commenting they couldnt live with only one bathroom. Yet when I have parties with  people it always works out. I think the physical closeness among guests encourages conversation and people are more open. Something about sharing close quarters even temporarily seems to bring out the jovial in people. I honestly cant imagine ever needing a larger space if anything if I ever move I will be looking for something half the size.

I personally disagree entirely with a dividing line between consumption and production as not being relevant. In addition video games is too broad of a category I would argue that plenty minecraft is the classic example lead to significant creation. In addition people into video games can end up writing fan content or mods for said game which I believe is undeniably creative. As for skill video games can easily argue that and there are plenty of studies to back that up. Id also argue that reading is a skill and that it tends to lead to a person being far more informed and thoughtfull not always large generalization depends on content read etc. I just dont agree that you need to build something to call it a hobby. As for something you are good at I think plenty of the things listed result in skills Maybe not skills you want yourself and thats fine but others may value those skills. I mean juggling creates nothing and I am not personally impressed with the skill gained so by this method I wouldnt consider it a hobby...

7929028,0,t1_d46v9js,Here is my living situation  I live in a small  X  cabin on  acres in the middle of nowhere.  I paid k for it and its paid for.  My taxes are  dollars a year but if I wanted to I could put the land into forestry or open space and significantly reduce them but  dollars a month is pretty easy housing expenses. Recently I have gotten broadband wireless internet with no data limits which costs me  dollars a month for the highest speed available.  There are cheaper plans that would probably be fine.   I have a google voice number and I use my computer as a phone to make and receive phone calls.   I have a cell phone but I dont have cell service hereI pay my son  dollars a month to be on his family plan with the lowest data limits. I power my laptop  watt led lightbulbs the broadband wireless and when its hot a fan off a small solar system.   My toilet is a  gallon bucket which I dump on a compost pile.  For water I melt snow in the winter time carry from a creek on my property in the spring  or haul from town from the community spigot.   Ive bought a sandpoint to develop a year round water source on my property.  Occasionally I buy a shower when I go to town. I have had  showers in the last year.   Recently I got a dry skin brush and have started daily dry brushing for bathing but before that I didnt bathe and that works for me.     I have a small basin to wash my hands face and hair in but I dont use soap or shampoo.  I own a small  year old pickup which I pay  dollars a month to insure.  I found a  dollar a month plan so that may be reduced soon.  I may also start putting my pickup on storage rate and only turning the insurance on a couple times a year as I only go to town now about every  months. About every  months I go to the transfer station to dump garbage.  That cost ..    I heat with wood and though I have plenty of wood on my property and a chainsaw I usually buy wood at  a cord.   I use about . cords a year.  My cabin is small and my wood stove heats it up too well so when I just want to take the chill off the cabin in the morning I use a Mr. Heater that is attached to a  gallon propane tank.  That is my luxury as I could easily start a little fire or even be a little cold.  I dont own a fridge or a oven.  I have a one burner propane stove that uses  gallons of propane a year.  I buy all my stuff online and though they wont deliver to my cabin I have a packboard and its a pleasant . mile walk through a pine forest to the little store to pick up packages.   Currently Im spending about  dollars a day on food and beverages mostly eating doityourself Soylent.  I wear the same thing everyday and occasionally like every  months I either wash my outfit in a five gallon bucket or at the laundrymat. I mostly hike but I like having a cabin to come to when I need to rest.  I dont work.  I quit my job  years ago to hike the Pacific Crest Trail and have never made it back to work.   I never planned to not go back to work but so far its worked out.   One thing I found out is going to work takes a lot of money.  Once you stop working you dont need nearly as much money.     Now I call myself retired but no one is paying me to be retired yet.   I think I could get my pension early if I wanted to at a reduced rate but right now everything is fine and I have everything I want so I dont see a reason to apply for it.  Here is a link to a tour of my cabin  ,simpleliving,d47apv5,11,t5_2r0za

So either take a risk or make a conscious deliberate choice not to. I would recommend that you either jump in with both feet or you do something disruptive enough in your life that you can get a better handle on what you really want without risking everything.

If your needs are being met then talk to a doctor about other options.One last anecdotal note youre not alone.

Once I do I will forward it since I know at least one person who has said many times how he is addicted to reading news and politics and being outraged. I dont know if this will change his life or anything but he will identify Im sure.Both of us know the value of being out in the wilderness and being unplugged. Way back long ago when there was only email we would go on backpacking trips and noticed it took about two to three days before all the thoughts of work and busyness finally were gone and we were fully in the actual experience.The time it takes to clear the mind hasnt really changed but the distance has because phone service is available now sometimes even in the wilderness and people use their phones for map and GPS. Sometimes I look at the commercials where phone companies brag about their coverage and I see all that empty white space in Nevada and think thats where I want to be.Back when I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail solo I found that one benefit of the connected world was that I would be out in the unconnected wilderness but because I knew people were following my blog I would think about the perfect way to write about something during the day and then write it by hand in my journal at night. Sort of like daily conversations in my mind. Eventually when I got to a town with a library or internet cafe I would type some of my journal into my blog and make phone calls. I enjoyed the bittersweet twang of loneliness and solitude out there and the feeling of joyful reunion when I was able to communicate. Absence makes the heart grow fonder.,simpleliving,d7xk6be,3,t5_2r0za

9949349,0,t3_5hvvy4,gtThe reason sickness is undesirable is not that it causes distress or discomfort but that it results in what is often called lost productivity. This is a sinister and absurd notion predicated on the greedy fallacy of counting chickens before they have hatched. Workplace absence through sickness was reported to cost British business bn a year the researcher claimed in Metro a normal way of phrasing things today but one with curious implications. The idea seems to be that business already has that money even though it hasnt earned it yet and employees who fail to maintain productivity as a result of sickness or other reasons are in effect stealing this as yet entirely notional sum from their employers.This blew my mind. I had never seen it this way before but its absolutely right and it is insidious. How can economists think that they have a right to  human productivity?

11154120,0,t3_5y432y,Depending on what you do for workschool set a rule for yourself to not check social media anytime before a certain hour. If you work at a company with others and need to do a quick scan of your email in the morning do that just to see that there arent any fires to be put out. Then move into your day in a proactive state instead of just reacting to emails and social inputs all morning.I recently implemented this rule at first during the first hour of the day. No checking SM until on the way to work.These days Im selfemployed so I have a new rule no outside inputs before lunch! It helps me cultivate a peaceful state of mind to focus on whatever work I need to do. All a part of my plan to make my work the most interesting thing I have to do when its time to work. Phone goes in a drawer in another room for the entire morning!Ill also throw a plug for Self Control its a desktop app that lets you blacklist certain sites the distracting ones so you have no way to access them for a set period of time that you decide. ,simpleliving,dewb393,2,t5_2r0za

11653271,0,t3_669oy0,we live in  sq ft for  people. thats less than  sqft per person. that includes our homeschool and a home office. I find it quite cozy. instead of looking at what you can get rid of look at what you need to bring. when we moved across country a year ago we only brought what we could fit in our cars. we really had to think hard about what was really necessary. we had an infant at the time too and babies need stuff leaving less for the rest of us.keep in mind what community resources will be available to you. you really just need a place to sleep and store your clothes. you will be on campus for the majority of your time. campuses have a ton of resourcesaffordable food outdoor space gym pool sports areas even showers quiet study space free wifi library. ,simpleliving,dggwv9r,5,t5_2r0za
