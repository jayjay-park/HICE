10927442,0,t1_de6rpqh,This is essentially the premise of the game as of now. I dig it this game has so much potential im excited. ,Hellion,de737t4,1,t5_3ekms
10931337,0,t3_5w5ryv,Same is happening to me. First it was crashing due to what appeared to be savegame compatibility so I wiped.Now it fails twice to connect to the main server then crashes due to an unhandled exception attempted to read or write protected memory. Tried on  different servers  being AWS cloud same result. If I attempt to run on a server where the ports arent forwarded and therefore cannot connect and sync with the main server at all it seems like its loading indefinitely.Either they accidentally borked the dedi server patch or intentionally neutered it to force people to play on Official servers or rent one.,Hellion,de7hnyj,1,t5_3ekms

10935991,0,t1_de7uxuw,There is a different between UI not being intuitive and a mechanic being broken AF. Im able to dock and replicate without issue. The mechanics are fine I wish the UI had more detailed  information. But so far everything I need is in there. ,Hellion,de7yyad,1,t5_3ekms

10952141,0,t3_5wea8u,If you manage your expectations I would encourage you to buy. Meaning you pay  so the devs can make this into a usable game. Meanwhile you get the chance to sample some aspects of what the game may later be. Right now its an Alphalevel thing so its riddled with bugs many gamebreaking. If youre looking for action this is not it. If youre looking for hours of painstaking taking it slow and trying to survive then it may be. ,Hellion,de9mw2a,1,t5_3ekms
10968579,0,t1_debbx3u,Thats what I thought. That never works for me  As soon as I warp away from my lifeboat its lost forever. The button does nothing.,Hellion,debbxrg,1,t5_3ekms

10996260,0,t1_dee6s9o, Next drag the arrival time down if it says acceleration too fast and keep dragging it down until it says course impossible. If you see that the reason is usually because your arrival time is BEFORE your departure time. Thats okay because you need to push the arrival time back up until it turns green and says FTL Ready or something like that. This method keeps your warp time at the absolute minimum and puts you closer to your target.With this point i get the course impossible but even when i adjust the time back up it says acceleration too fast. i cannot get it to say FTL ready.,Hellion,deee4s9,1,t5_3ekms

11095752,0,t1_depdi21,Just in case you didnt see the other comments you may have been using the bugged EVA jetpack. For me the airlock module that spawns in the starting area always has  bugged EVA jetpack in the locker. You know its the bugged one if it ignores the artificial gravity and always floats around when dropped regardless of where you are.,Hellion,depozj1,1,t5_3ekms

I thirst for all those things have you succeeded in docking the modules to the ship by grapple and taking them with you to the life pod? Or do you go the other way around stripping the life pod and setting the main base on some bigger piece you found?,Hellion,df3h5wq,1,t5_3ekms
