1176429,0,t1_ci1jnvj,I love it in FSC for taking down hoards of slags.  You run around with DBB or AoA to round them up VT slows the process.  Then you start dumping shard bombs to mop them up really quickly.  The thing is you want to run around inside the hoard rather than around the edges.  Another good strategy for using them is to do the spot spam where you run back and fourth from  drop spots so you can avoid the ranged attacks and draw in a wider range of mobs.,spiral_knights,ci1yv8r,1,t5_2sece
1479558,0,t3_2b3foo,They wouldnt scrap it. Thats just bitterness.There was a fun little thread on general forums talking about how the gunner update was confirmed canceled. GM showed up to say not to spread false information.I am tired of hoping and waiting. Particularly considering how fun to gun it was.,spiral_knights,cj1ql8b,3,t5_2sece

2750905,0,t1_cngqccp,Early on this game ran on CE and ME. ME regenerated over time at around  ME per  hours but CE was only purchasable through buying packs or using ingame currency in the CE market. CE was needed in just about every aspect of the game but CE was only added to the market if someone purchased it to begin with. CE price inflation became a huge problem. Elevators at the time cost  CEME to use. This made the game very FP unfriendly. Elevators are now free so people can play as much as they want.I cant explain the current reviews but maybe someone else can. I stopped playing after the forge system was implemented. It probably has something to do with that.Note I stopped playing due to multiple reasons mostly I just wanted to move on.,spiral_knights,cngrlsg,1,t5_2sece

4038970,0,t3_36o5tl,FSC is great unless you want to heat your gear since there are no intermediate forge stations and if you jump back up you loose your vitapod and capsules and especially if you run chaos you need those damn blue pills.But since you want money here you go,spiral_knights,crgo8t4,1,t5_2sece

4124948,0,t1_crqax09,The chaos robe set is definitely the end all to armors defense is not particularly important if youre not getting hit and killing everything quickly. As far as guns go blasters and the antigua line are fun and easy but the alchemers are where the true power lies. These dont get good until you upgrade them but the bounce is not to be underestimated.,spiral_knights,crqgwfb,2,t5_2sece

4667105,0,t3_3evs6v,If you enjoy it its not a waste of money. Ive spent so much money on this game and I dont regret that. Now the lack of updates with actual content is what is killing the game either way if you have a group of friends or a guild to play with you shouldnt worry too much about it and you should just play the game its really fun.,spiral_knights,ctiucex,6,t5_2sece

5360164,0,t3_3oekeq,Short answer Probably not.Long answer The community for this game is on the decline. And that isnt doom speaking thats the statistics talking. So it will be harder to find people to reliably play with. And if you end up grouping with long time players then its a very real possibility that those you play with just stop playing.Its also hard to recommend people to get invested in a game that has made it abundantly clear that there is very little plans in terms of creating sustainable endgame content for long time players. Its not that SK is a bad game its just that its basically keep growing more and more stale and the developers are under delivering in new playable content. And the content released isnt very replayable.,spiral_knights,cvwtkxh,1,t5_2sece

6369082,0,t1_czcqwna,Pvp nowadays seems more of an entertainment for old players with op gear than a game for everyone. I dont know when I was playing lockdown it was fun for a while until it became boring.Players always choose the most powerful gear you try to struggle and do your best and you realise you cant do much since theyre better in all aspects. To achieve their level you should grind lockdown grind pve pay money to improve your gear and it takes a lot of time. Pvp sucks.,spiral_knights,czdlflg,3,t5_2sece
7453476,0,t3_4h8ne0,Pretty much what has happened is that SEGA dropped Three Rings entirely. People from the old team who wanted to move onto other things have done so but people who want to stay on board have moved over to a company called Grey Havens which is essentially three rings stuff that they stopped supporting.Essentially were free of SEGAs clutches whatever they may have done and are back to having a bit more freedom. Right now they are still in a transfer process which will take some time.We arent sure if an update to the game will ever really happen however the game masters have been becoming more involved with the community since this news so we might start feeling the love again and potentially even get new content but I wouldnt start expecting anything unless its straight up announced.,spiral_knights,d2pevnf,3,t5_2sece
