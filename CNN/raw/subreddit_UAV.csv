4744857,0,t3_3fvuet,Currently you require a private sports or commercial pilots license for FAA exemption .  I am also looking into breaking into this field with an UAV operators certificate but I dont know how far this certificate will get me with current FAA requirements.  The hope is that this will change in the coming year where all you need is a certificate.  But if anyone else knows more on the subject it is appreciated.,UAV,ctsmu3h,1,t5_2rrhm
