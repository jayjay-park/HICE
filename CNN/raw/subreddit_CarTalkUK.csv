3550759,0,t3_2yk7gx,Not really to your point but in the spirit of insurance savingsIt seems the average risk profile for the vehicle is based on some analysis of who is going to be driving it. Everyone whos added a young family member to their policy will know this the hard wayAdding older and more experienced drivers as named drivers on the policy will bring the quote down. Ive been doing this for years adding  friends from an older generation after getting initial quotes. Always saves me some cash.,CarTalkUK,cpx0cwi,1,t5_2w2lq

7097465,0,t3_4cg2f8,If you have still got the original advertisement to refer to and the car is materially different to what was claimed you can discuss a refund or adjustmentnew belt fittedwheel fitted.  If the advert does not mislead you then your word against theirs is worth nothing.  A visit to a tyre outlet will give you an expert opinion on your wheels written down on paper.  Since you accepted the car it can be argued that certain things might have happened AFTER your purchase date so a cracked wheel needs an expert eye to state roughly how long a fault has existed.  In the case of the wheel the vehicle was not of merchantablequality so can be returned for repairs to rectify the matter.  The cambeltchain issue is really one of servicing and normal wear and tear.  You might if you were polite and reasonable get the dealer to go halves on a belt change ?  Car sales people dont know that much about how their products work and it is easy to make mistakes.  Different models have different engines as do model years and keeping up with all this is nearly impossible.  Dont go believing that chains dont go wrong !  They stretch jump teeth and do lots of nasty things too which is why they need changing at certain intervals as well.,CarTalkUK,d1kv9ez,1,t5_2w2lq
7178862,0,t3_4dte53,Did they give you the small green slip from the Logbook? It should say VC in the top right hand corner and contain all basic vehicle details such as make model and reg number.  You will need this slip to tax the car which you need to do pretty much straight away.  The new log book with your details should get to you within about ten days or so.  ,CarTalkUK,d1u6766,3,t5_2w2lq

7663961,0,t3_4k48p5,What I would say is that in my experience a car that costs  with  or fewer miles and a full service history will last about  years with just basic servicing with a vacuum oil change pump and a socket set car servicing becomes easy and cheapBuy midrange cars of the boring sort that get looked after  Astras yes Focuses perhaps a better drive Octavia or Corolla for the reliability. I used to recommend .TD Mondeos and Volvo S Mks with any engine but the GDi but they are all getting so old nowYour  keeps you in halfdecent cars for about  years that way,CarTalkUK,d3dckct,2,t5_2w2lq
8662015,0,t1_d6er3t9,Mitsu get unfairly ignored a lot of the time.   Colt is a good solid alternative to a Corolla  Almera cheaper to run and buy.    Lancer is a good swap for a Volvo V Focus or Golf.  Their x ranges are completely comparable to the Toyota Landcruiser for almost militaryspec levels of resilience and the ASX mini x is rarely seen and rarely sold by its owners cos they love them.,CarTalkUK,d6odb5f,1,t5_2w2lq

10078914,0,t3_5g9cpq,Id recommend a  Honda Civic Sport .l. Insurance may be a tad higher but theyre going dirt cheap nowadays for under  for below k miles. All the sweet looks of the Type R without the high insurance cost. It was my first car and I absolutely loved it. Best of all I never had a single problem with it and maintenance costs were tiny. Fun little car too just enough power so its fun to chuck about but not too much that its overwhelming for a firsttime driver.Heres some pics,CarTalkUK,dblaxcu,1,t5_2w2lq

11058576,0,t3_5xwqn1,I hope thats an accidental extra  on your mileage...I would recommend a service especially if you dont know much about cars. The MOT means your car is safe to be on the road but the service keeps it on the road. Oil changes etc. should be done regularly otherwise youll shorten your cars lifespan. A third party garage will suffice  dealerships are ridiculously expensive.Having a full service history will also help when you come to selling the car.,CarTalkUK,delgzcm,1,t5_2w2lq
