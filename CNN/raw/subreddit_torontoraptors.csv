79716,0,t1_ceneymj,yeah id rather have Ross than commit big money to stephenson or afflalo.. the only real position we need to upgrade assuming Lowry stays is power forward.

105627,0,t1_ceqg7nc,Paul isnt a forward though. And personally I think Win Shares is an incredibly weak way to gauge how good a player is since a good player on a team with a good record will likely get more Win Shares than a great player on a team with a bad record. Kyle Lowry has the th most Win Shares in the NBA I dont think hes the thbest player.  I think PER is a much better measure of a players individual performance and George ranks th there behind  other forwards Durant LeBron Love Anthony Davis if you consider him a forward Nowitzki Melo Aldridge Horford if you consider him a forward and Griffin.,torontoraptors,ceqggi7,2,t5_2s5sb

162657,0,t1_cewlgao,I hear what youre saying and I dont fault you for it but its tough for me to even see him as a Raptor first and foremost at this point.He played  more games for the Raps than he did for the Nets. . He played more than  games in a season for only  of the  full seasons he was in Toronto. He played more than  games for all  full seasons he was in New Jersey. His pergame point assist and rebound averages as a Net are higher than as a Raptor in both regular season and playoffs. I agree that he may be most memorable as a Raptor because thats where he was at his most athletic and was in the dunk contest which will form a big part of his fan memory but he was arguably and statistically a better player as a Net.,torontoraptors,cewyjl7,1,t5_2s5sb

Hansbrough Jonas and Amir all have problems defensively against larger players Hayes helps this defensive hole the raps have. However Hayes does seem to get  a lot of minutes guarding players like Blake last night which seems to be a major coaching error.

He is still limited offensively and rarely creates for himself down low. He is still so young and he would probably benefit from more playing time so he can learn from his mistakes but it seems as though since the Rudy trade that our goal is to go for broke in the playoffs.

482393,0,t3_1zmr17,Its actually very close between the two currently. Their per numbers are really close  for Barnes  for Ross. Ross takes more threes he currently doubles up Barnes in  point rate while Barnes gets to the line more coincidentally Barnes gets to the line twice as much Ross. Both are really good iso defenders with Ross being th overall at . points per possession allowed while Barnes is at th at . points per possession allowed. That said Ross in isos is allowing opponents to shoot  while Barnes is at  so even though theres a large difference in rank its actually minuscule. These  are pretty even overall. Hell even their various rates rebound block steal assist turnover usage are close too with Barnes offering more on the defensive end by way of win shares and Ross offering more on the offensive side by win shares thanks to the his s. With how close they are it boils down to what we need for the team and where we are as a franchise. If we were rebuilding Id take Barnes due to higher free throw and being younger. For our situation though? Ross since he doesnt need the ball in his hands help produce.,torontoraptors,cfv3nop,7,t5_2s5sb

I have no problems with people putting themselves and only themselves at risk. If someone wants to risk themselves of alcohol poisoning be my guest. You arent harming others passed out on a lawn or a sofa. I pass no judgement when people do what ever to themselves. Its only when they put others at risk that I pass judgement.I know Im sounding like an ass however Im a firm believer that you can do what ever you want whether its legal or illegal by yourself.

Say what you will but he was the one true star maybe you could argue Mats Sundin and Jose Bautista weve had over the last  decades especially in a sport where a star has a significantly greater effect on their teams success.He didnt transcend anything.

Terrence also has age significantly in his side and the lone fact of not fucking up chemistry and changing something that is already working is a reason unto itself.

2890806,0,t3_2t8dih,This is the first realistic trade suggestion I have heard from this sub and actually like.  Ideally wed live in a world where we could get an all star  who is a game changing defender and is still a good offensive player in his own right but doesnt need his shot called for him. This would be a Bosh or an Ibaka. That way we could move Amir to the back up  and it would kill  birds with one stone and we would become championship contenders. Unfortunately thats not realistic.  I fear that hes too similar to Patrick and it wouldnt really make sense though seeing as how we need more size for a back up .  Not a bad suggesiton though. Definitely reasonable seeing as how Donatas has emerged as a very legitimate player and then they added Josh Smith. TJones seems to be the very capable odd man out.,torontoraptors,cnwosa7,3,t5_2s5sb

Masai has even said it himself this is a rare opportunity to win the Eastern conference.The conference is looking a lot stronger now than it did at the  mark of the season with Cle turning it around Chi getting back on track and ATL going bonkers.. but the rest of the conference is embarrassing. Were talking all time bad type stuff and in the Atlantic it looks like every team is several years away and no matter what the Raps do it would be hard for us to mess it up bad enough not to be strong favorites for the Division until all those Philli picks come home to roost. On the whole however you have to expect the East to get more competitive just based on FAs wanting to play in an easier conference that also has more open spots to fill. You also have to assume that the Raps wont be able to get their hands on any of these FAs as has always been the case. Hell Toronto cant even attract a FA in hockey. The raps can easily finish nd in the Eastern conference this year with a trade or two to give this team a boast in front court depth. At nd we would have a cake st round matchup and then anything can happen... If we get the depth to compete upfront against a team like Chi or Cle.

Or games where he just doesnt play in the th quarter at all.Why is that? Casey. I just dont think well see any statistical improvements from him because Casey still wont play him. Every single acquisition in the off season has been small ball related. JV wont get anymore touches or mins than he would have last year cause well still see small ball line ups. perhaps its too early to say cause were not done spending money yet but unless we get a hulking big to pair up with JV I can totally see Casey playing small ball all night long next season. ,torontoraptors,csv3d0l,5,t5_2s5sb

5565858,0,t1_cwmzb2s,It was a precarious position for the front office I believe. Youre right that we now have a good amount of money tied up in Terrance Ross which we could offload if we do somehow sniff out a big free agent signing Ive a feeling teams that dont have many good shooters MEMPHIS will take a real long look at Terrance. Thats always something I feel like we as casual observes of the league dont have much insight or feel for is how much demand and interest front offices show in other teams players. If Masai knows a team like Memphis will be very likely to go to the table for Ross if he became available because hes basically been told that and has that feeling that would effect how youd approach negotiating with Ross camp. But sure its a risk but I just have that feeling its a very moveable contract. Terrance can shoot there are teams that really do need guys that can shoot well. He also happens to be good size for his position and is really athletic. And young! Thats like a perfect storm of Front Office bait. Look at what fucking Jason Kidd gave up for Greivis! I guarantee you its because GV is good size for his position and the Bucks are in the process of creating some giant wingspand superteam. lol And now every Bucks fans wants Grieviss head because he cant shoot well and is too slow and we got fucking Norman Powell and a st rounder. Glorious! Masai knows how to move a good looking player to another team. I think itll be alright. ,torontoraptors,cwmzue5,2,t5_2s5sb

Bismack has no offence and with JV guarding the paint we might as well give the opposing team the points in advance. We need a centre that can play some defence and score a bit. BBJV is not gonna cut it. Those LowryDeRozan socalled ISOs are only after the players getting the mismatches. I think thats fair specially for two guards who have a very good first step and beat the defenders consistently. What we need is a couple of outside sharpshooters.  of our main offensive weapons DDLowryJV all operate best in the paint but with no point threat they just cant get the spacing or room to do their thing. Honestly unless RossCarrollPPat get their outside shots going our offence is gonna look ugly. That and of course the bench.

5832498,0,t1_cxk37wj,Id rather keep this pick if its in the top  and wouldnt even consider trading it if its in the top . I dont see the current team even with the addition made by trading this pick making us win this year. Masai looks like hes planning more into the future with the corey joseph carrol and jv signings. Hes not going to invest too much into this current team and will be fine with making the playoffs and getting passed the st round for once. It would be better to keep this pick and develop it in the hopes we can continually be competitive instead of selling everything now for a team that frankly is unlikely going to make the finals as it is now. He can always sell the farm to get top players but thatll only last a few years before we go downhill.Now if this team surprises us and makes the conference finals then I can see him making big moves to push them to the finals. But currently I think hes just trying to set the building blocks for the future such that well make the playoffs year after year and hopefully sign Wiggins once hes free from the Wolves or Durant. ,torontoraptors,cxk61dh,7,t5_2s5sb

6889596,0,t3_4a2fv2,Well lets look at all teams in the current playoff picture  even ones we may meet in later rounds this is the year boysTLDR I like BostonAtlanta Indiana matchups the best Cleveland and Miami are the scariest.. Cleveland  obviously the scariest. Playoff Lebron is a different beast and they have a lot of talent along with numerous bench players who can step up and have big nights.. Us  I think well stay with the second seed by season end. Itd be nice to have another banner to hang in the ACC but Im still very happy with this outcome.. Boston  Young fast exciting but I dont think theyre a very scary match up for us. They have fantastic team defense but I dont see any of them stopped Lowry DD or even JV one on one. . Miami  this is probably the scariest round  matchup for us. Huge threats at   and  and DC can only guard one of them. Not to mention stretch s in general have given us trouble this season. I can see this going to  very close and exciting potential series.. Charlotte  Have seemed to have our number in the past but on paper they are not very scary. Our starting backcourt is superior in most aspects and we trade the scoring ability Lin gives them with the play making and distributing that CoJo brings off the bench. The key for this series will be defending the  which have struggled with in this year with our paintpriority defensive schemes. . Atlanta  similar to Charlotte in play style though they are much scarier on paper. We gave them so many open looks last game but Atlanta just wasnt sinking them. We will need to feast in the paint and destroy them on the glass which I think we can do.. Indiana  Not scary. PG is scary and can take over a game but we would be rotating DCJJPowell on him all series. Other players would have to step up for the Pacers to stand a chance.. Detroit  Is not a good match up for us on paper yet we dont seem to struggle with them lately not counting our Lowryless last game. Big athletic front court with a rebounding menace in Drummond and a fast and athletic backcourt that can annoy and wear down our guards. We will need to stay even with them on the boards and sink our s. . Chicago  It baffles me every time we lose to this team because we just shouldnt be. Cant even comprehend why we just shouldnt be. We win on paper  and hopefully we can do what Washington did to us last year and pull a reverseplayoff sweep.. Washington  Not even sure how to gauge this team because theyve been injured all year. They dismantled us last year but we are a VERY different team this time around. I think we could take them at full health. ,torontoraptors,d0x94cp,2,t5_2s5sb

Canadian sports fan to ever care or even know whats happening with Canadas team?Edit This pisses me off even more when not a single Canadian NHL team is relevant his year.

6957587,0,t1_d14vpvp,I agree that the OP is looking a bit with rose coloured glasses but youre looking with shit coloured glasses.Yes Biz absolutely still does have trouble hitting those kinds of shots. Hes had only a handful of games where hes actually hit those and all of them were downright near lucky so lets not start looking at Biyombo with Rose coloured glasses and start saying hes capable on offence he is a liability.JV is not the worst defensive Center among playoff teams I mean cmon. Really? Now youre just over exaggerating. Thats worse than OP. OlynykSully in Boston Big Al in Charlotte Kanter in OKC Zaza in Dallas PlumleeMeyers in Portland. All of these guys are worse than JV on offense. I would also say Ian Mahinmi but I think Mahinmi is actually either equal or slightly better than JV on defence everyone else that I didnt mention IS better than JV on defence.Also OP is not saying JV is going to become Tim Duncan or Pau Gasol. Thats not what comparing stats is about. Its about creating context. JV has a certain set of offensive skills that allow him to perform at an incredibly efficient clip he posted the numbers so I wont. Yes his usage rate is lower but again OP is not saying JV is going to become those guys who had muuuch higher usage rate at this point in their careers but rather that we are undervaluing how good his offense actually is. There arent many big men that score like he does. With DeMar and Lowry on our team any centre we get will have a relatively low usage rate. Why not keep the guy whos using the usage rate that he gets efficiently and is incredibly proficient offensively when he gets the ball? JV is one of the main reasons were as good as are in the st quarter without him we stink and its not a coincidence.Also you keep talking about where he gets his buckets but youre not understanding how beyond the fact that he uses a hook shot.Many of JVs points come from under the basket because of  reasons his ability to post up take a step inside the defender and finish at the rim or a hook shot all because of footwork and post position and his ability to grab offensive rebounds and putting them home he is excellent at this.He can also hit baseline jumpers but hesitates wayyyyyy too much. He needs to stop that shit. And my favourite part he can finish with either hand just as effectively. Also hes an excellent free throw shooter for a big man. Allllll of these factors combined and even taking his belowaverage defense into consideration hes still a much better Center than hes given credit for and is easily the better option over Biz to start this season and every single season after.,torontoraptors,d14z5wz,2,t5_2s5sb

A Team like Atlanta needed exactly that last year in the playoffs and its a reason why Miami is touted so highly as the contender to take on Cleveland  they have multiple players who can create on ISO plays. ,torontoraptors,d1webnk,2,t5_2s5sb

7431946,0,t1_d2mx71m,Completely agree. That said the team has some serious deficiencies. Lowry is injured and cant shoot at this point. This puts pressure on Demar and co to score and right now we see what happens when the ball doesnt go in. Sure Lowry can create offense and play defense but the Pacers were playing him to shoot going over the screen. I think Indiana adjusts in Game  and lets Lowry shoot banking on his injured elbow to brick those shots. This makes life even harder for the remaining  players. And considering our best lineup is Lowry   bench the Pacers will neutralize that lineup with that strategy. The core of the Raptors will always be Lowry Demar is the pudding on top. If Demar can score  we have a good chance to win the game if not where will the offense come from? And if history says anything the Pacers have exposed Demars weaknesses. My only hope is Lowrys elbow doesnt affect his shot Sunday. ,torontoraptors,d2myr3t,1,t5_2s5sb

He wants us to run in the open court and score fast break point off of stops and turnovers but as you saw in this game things end up getting slowed down a lot. Probably a combo of playoff basketball and the other coaches game planning for us because it was the same last series whereas in  the reg season we didnt have this problem as much. Casey doesnt have a set offense its just pick and roll then see what happens. Ive rarely seen him draw up plays out of timeouts either so that coupled with pure bad shot selection by derozan and Lowry forgetting how to shoot for the last month... offence is a serious struggle for us right now.

Everyone wanted to see PacersHeat rivalry because it was more than a simple rivalry between two championship seeking teams it was personal and it was fun to see the drama play out. Teams played harder argued more were more physical fans cheered louder and booed harder. This just morphed the entire series into a new animal. Canadians are all united behind the Raptors and Miami is all united behind Wade. Just when you thought this series couldnt get any better this whole fiasco happened and now I guarantee you every game from here on out will be one of the biggest slugfests youve ever seen. Both these teams have gone through injuries and been knocked around mentally and physically and this just added another catalyst.

8057986,0,t1_d4ls8kd,Honestly I dont know for sure. I dont watch enough college basketball to make a definitive statement on that especially New Mexico State who only had  big game against Baylor.According to scouts Skal is an excellent shot blocker and can shoot from distance. Not a great rebounder can be overpowered especially by NBA players and is incredibly raw. Very little polish to his game. Would take a couple years for him to be a contributor for a team I doubt Masai wants to wait that long. We already have a  project in Caboclo.Siakam is said to be a decent finisher in the post doesnt really have an outside touch. Excellent shot blocker good instincts and relentless energy. Quite athletic and is VERY long  with  wingspan!!!Honestly the only thing that Skal has over Siakam is the very high ceiling. But Skal also has a very low floor. So its risky. I guess Siakam is more of a sure thing but again I cant really know for sure I havent really watched them. Skal also a better distance shooter but I think Masai and Casey put more emphasis on defence and athleticism. Also Siakam is  years old and Bilas said he has NBA tools and is NBA ready. Skal would take a couple years before he could start to contribute. He is very raw.The fact is plenty of teams passed on Skal. There must be a reason for that that the scouts and managers and coaches know about. We dont know but thats why we dont work for the NBA.,torontoraptors,d4lsl5v,6,t5_2s5sb

8131151,0,t1_d4u05vs,What do sixers fan think about Ross in the longterm and why do you want him? If you really want to be a championship team he needs to be the th man as in you cant really expect Ross to be a critical part of your starting core can you?. As of right now and what his development is looking to be like his ceiling is a D starter at best and will more likely become a scorer off the bench like jamal crawford and lou williams. My question has always been if teams know that the raptors need cap space and know that trading Ross away will clear up a lot why would other teams offer anything to take him? Hes not going to be great and its just helping your competition get better by taking him. IMO Ross is worth more to the Raptors than other teams simply because of the cap situation that the Raptors are in and the leverage that other teams have. A fair deal would more likely be Ross for Covington but this sub would blow up if anyone mentioned it and Masai would never even consider it. Which is why I dont think a deal would go down.,torontoraptors,d4u0j48,1,t5_2s5sb

His strength has made him worse when he was a rookie was much faster and mobile. The strength and weight have caused him to be much slower. Again his offensive game and touch are great but are they really that valuable.

These are two guys who have a history of being good defenders. Not just one season flash in the pan defenders but a multiple year history of being able to do it. Yet here they look like theyve never played defense in their lives. That is scheme. That is coaching. Look at CoJo under Pop.

10796430,0,t1_ddt2i1s,gt I just dont understand why our fans simply fail to see how big of a liability JV is defensively for the team and offensively he has only showed up to a handful of game this season. Its because it doesnt show up easily on the box score and is therefore treated much more subjectively or ignored completely whereas its easy to see wow he got a double double! Im not a hater I think JVs a good player though probably not as good as we might have hoped but people need to be realistic about what his strengths and weaknesses are first step is admitting he does have weaknesses and they are what impacts when he gets used.,torontoraptors,ddtkp92,2,t5_2s5sb

10800352,0,t1_ddtv0sh,I think you can marry the two styles for most of the game but late in games I think we increasingly need to go away from DeRozan. I think you can balance moving the ball around and clearing out for DeRozan one on ones just not late in games. Hes much better at getting his game off early when the defense hasnt tightened or he has a weak defender on him but the isos they run for him late are predictable and ineffective. Late in games we need to ball movement and looking for the open man not the open LowryDeRozan. ,torontoraptors,ddtz9o4,6,t5_2s5sb

Whether its the fan deck the Junior Jays days allowing kids to run the base paths themed days with bobble heads etc.  I know a lot of it held over from when the Jays were miserably mediocre and thats good.  The Raptors do none of that because the Raps always sell out and they have had continued support during down periods.The thing to emphasize that they know already I am sure is that the fam experience begins and largely ends with the product on the field.  If Rogers continues to invest in the club on the field it wont matter what else happens around it.  The fans will come and have a good time.

11193476,0,t1_df0nqmm,Thats also not very true. Current NBA demands mobile and shooter centers not particularly great defenders. Neither of KAT Jokic KD and Lopez is a great defender. Boogie too to some extents.       On defensive end both JV and Drummond struggle because their huge body prevents them from being mobile but even in that case there is a difference.       JV used to be way less masculine than he is today and by no mean he has Drummonds body structure. Our FO force him to get masculine which was a wrong move. He can lose weight again like what Chris Bosh did. I dont think Drummond can change that.      And about Casey I also agree that JV is not a the right piece of Caseys offense but I think before axing JV we should also consider firing Casey too.

11235091,0,t3_60dev7,This was a great game to watch after the last two. Sure the Raptors came away with the W against Detroit but their offense was worrisome. In this game the ball was moving all over the floor and guys were knocking down their open looks. It sounds simple but thats the key to Raptors success. You also cant deny the impact of Ibaka and Tucker on this team everybody was locked in defensively and it was beautiful to watch. I dont have a lot of negatives in this type of loss and I was doing homework during the game so my analysis isnt as long as normal but I do have some things I saw tonight.PositivesFirst Quarter for the FrontcourtBoth Ibaka and JV looked dynamite in the first quarter. Ibaka was everywhere locking down on defense protecting the rim running the floor and knocking down shots. Meanwhile JV was active on the boards and cleaned up guys messes on the offensive end. Leo made a great point about how JV doesnt pout when he doesnt get a touch. Instead he battles for the offensive rebound and looks to clean up the glass. When he plays like that hes effective on a Lowry and DeRozan led team.PJ Tucker on Paul GeorgeCome on. Im ready to propose to this guy right now. The way he plays defense is what some people would call ugly but Id call it beautiful. Hes in the guys jersey hes moving his feet hes running around screens and hes contesting everything. It blows my mind when I watch a guy like this play because it looks like nothing but effort. What hes doing doesnt look particularly technical which is why I wonder why some of our wings cant play better defense or why guys like Harden and DeRozan have to be known as poor defenders when they have all the physical tools.People need to watch the way this guy denies his man from getting the ball. Even if his man gets the ball hes not going to get it until hes near centre court. This is what effective defense on DeMar looks like as well and something that really throws a wrench in the other teams offensive scheme. To attack from there they have to run a high screen which gives the defense a lot more time to set and find their position. Sharing the Ball EarlyThere were ! assists in the first quarter. Thats an amazing upgrade from the singledigit assist games weve been seeing. Theres obviously going to be growing pains with Lowry out of the lineup but I stand by my assertion in an earlier post about how this is a good chance for the team to learn to play when hes not on the floor. Weve relied on him for so much since hes broken out that I feel dread whenever hes not on the floor. This is a chance for this Raptors team to change that and it starts with ball movement.Making Open ShotsThis has been a huge problem over the past couple games. Demarre Carroll and Patrick Patterson have notoriously been missing their open s this season. This game we saw a more confident stroke from Carroll and the whole team seemed to be hitting their open shots at a much higher rate than they have been.NegativesPowell StartPowell started off pretty cold on offense. I agree with Leos point about him being forced into a bunch of tough shots as soon as he gets on the floor. It seemed like he was expected to somehow save possessions late in the clock and hit dep s. Norm is at his best attacking the rim and itd be nice to see the Raptors look for that early whenever he checks in. Usually he can be the primary offensive weapon with the bench unit so itd be great to see him get going when he comes in by attacking the rim with his drives.Tony BrothersThe block was clean.,torontoraptors,df5hd52,81,t5_2s5sb

The real problem is that you cant bring everyone back considering the insanely high luxury tax penalty the team would pay. Yes MLSE has said they would be willing to be a luxury team but there is a difference between being  million over the cap and  million. Lowry is going to cost the team  million Ibaka  Patterson  and Tucker . That is just too much salary to bring back.

11565724,0,t3_652pop,Finished exams yesterday BLESS so I figured I could cover this game while using beer to forget everything I had to learn this semester. Not the best game to analyse considering it felt more like a pickup atmosphere but I loved watching our guys put their foot on the neck and not let up no matter what players were in those Cavs jerseys. We got to see some meaningful sort of minutes from some young inexperienced guys tonight. Fred looked great Poeltl looked great Siakam hustled Delon did his thing Norm looked excellent and Bruno almost looked like an NBA player. All in all fairly successful night. Now time to catch some NHL playoff games.PositivesGood StartThe Raptors had an uncharacteristically nice start tonight. They usually go down big early but started the game engaged on both ends of the floor. Halfway through the first quarter they led  not an amazing number but definitely nice to see compared to what were used to. They struggled for the rest of the quarter in particular but it could have been much worse without strong defense.Norman PowellOne thing thats great about Norm is that he comes in and plays hard no matter what. Hes had some real down games lately but he came in strong. I completely agree with Jack in thinking that Norm struggles as the number one guy on the second unit. Hes best when he plays with somebody else who can handle the ball and make plays. I prefer him to come off of motion and drive to the hoop so that he doesnt have to make too many decisions. Here is a good example He also knocked down his jumpers which is great. Im thinking about writing up a full analysis of his season so you guys might see that between now and our first playoff game since Ive got a lot of free time for the next month.Jakob Poeltls Court VisionBigs that can pass and see the court well are undervalued in my opinion. Just look at the way Jokic impacts a game for the Nuggets. My friend texted me during the Knicks game the other day saying that Yak is already better than Jonas. I laughed that off of course considering Jonas experience and offensive ability. However the more I think about it the more I realize that hes right in a way. Yak has the court vision and ball IQ that Jonas does not and I doubt ever will have. Watch this pass You can see how quickly he decides to hit Fred on the cut and hit him right on the money. Look at this play as well. He starts the play with a handoff then follows the ball to the rim.BrunoAny time we get to see Bruno means it was a great game. If he gets a handle some confidence and keeps improving his footwork we might actually see him play meaningful minutes one day.JV ThreeDo I have to say anything about this?NegativesGeneral GameThis game lacked emotion because pretty well everybody rested and we got to watch the  take on a member of the   the Cavs ancient bench. The real losers of this game are the people who bought tickets.,torontoraptors,dg6zajc,36,t5_2s5sb

11774338,0,t3_68074w,So that was both great and totally sucked.You just cant blow a lead like that to a team that isnt the Warriors or doesnt have Lebron or shit to ANYONE. The Raptors played like garbage on both ends in the th. The th quarter was like the nd half of game  where the Bucks didnt do anything special they just played a smart solid game while the Raptors shot themselves in the foot on nearly every possession. As great as Derozan was in the st half he totally lost it in the th and checked out on defense... until the amazing dunk to finally break them. Its almost like when the Bucks stopped doubling him he reverted to his silly iso ways except thats MUCH harder to do against long perimeter defenders like the Bucks have. Bad things happen when Cory Joseph is the only PG on the floor. I loved the defense that Patterson played. He got beat on one back cut bit on a shot fake once otherwise he was excellent. It should be him and Tucker as the primary defenders on Lebron. The noncalls on the Giannis charge and the Terry slap were brutal. Fuck that shit.I thought the Raptors would win in . At least it didnt go . The Raptors were the better and more talented team and showed it in the end.PS Fuck you Greg Monroe.,torontoraptors,dgunme6,1,t5_2s5sb
11774379,0,t1_dgungxq,That was just the SNET people making a mistake. Bucks had  free throws and made the first giving them  but the score on screen didnt update until after they missed the second FT. Thought that was weird too,torontoraptors,dgunsh8,2,t5_2s5sb

11782058,0,t1_dgvex6o,Were not the only people in this situation right? Its easy to say be calm play your game resist the run etc but you know what? You got the other fucking team balling out and that was a viciously loud crowd. There are factors preventing you from taking things slow. ,torontoraptors,dgvj8w5,1,t5_2s5sb
