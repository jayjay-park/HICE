Adds a whole new feeling to everything not to mention its fun and a quick way to get some of the simpler things wrapped around your head. You say you like punk which is simple enough  just start removing your pinky on your minor bar chords and youll have some minor s. looking at it that way jazz chords are only a note away from the simplest chords. Incorporate that into your playing and youd be surprised how quickly you can start hearing things. ,jazzguitar,cfv53cv,2,t5_2sfad

Own that tune. I promise after learning one tune that well it will be easier to learn the next tune and all forms will be easier to follow. Eventually get  that you know like the back of your hand. This will improve your jazz playing like you wouldnt believe. The more tunes you really learn the easier it is to learn new tunes. ,jazzguitar,co584f5,7,t5_2sfad

5281167,0,t3_3nbyx3,Theyre both great companies with good qualities about each instrument its going to be a tough call. Eastmans are generally much easier to find easier to setup less expensive depending on the model youre looking for and a bit more versatile. You can get a good Eastman for between  and . Sadowsky makes a hell of a jazz box though. They can be a little pricy but if youll be hard pressed to find an instrument voiced as well for jazz at that price point.  The Sadowsky guitars Ive seen generally go for between  and . Ive heard instruments from both companies outperform more expensive competition which isnt to say that either of them are cheapI personally have an Eastman T its their ES  kind of guitar and I love it. That being said I dont really play to much straight ahead swing so the Sadowsky isnt really the instrument for me much of the time. Ive had a couple teachers that played Sadowsky instruments though and they always got that awesome Jim Hall kind of tone out of them plus they look pretty great too.,jazzguitar,cvmqb8z,2,t5_2sfad

Or over the whole thing?If I am guessing correctly you might have played those notes leading into the Dm. If you were thats awesome! Why? Well you can add in an A leading into the Dm and these two notes which arent in the key of C major create the A chord.SoDm G | Cmaj AbDo you think this was the case?

Chords scales theory etc.Thats one part...Then theres playing that classical guitar and what to do with it.  The classical is favored by quite a lot of fingerstyle players and most all Latin Brazilian and other artists.So youre going to have to learn the essentials of playing the classical guitar and classical fingerstyle technique.Thats what Ive been doing almost exclusively for the last couple of years.....

6979812,0,t3_4bae4t,Before anything your technique is really what should get you that sound. It would be helpful to get used to the feel of flatwounds but your experience on the acoustic will not completely translate to the electric. Which doesnt really matter ultimately but its a different beast.One thing that will help is to pick near the fretboard. And use a stiff pick. The timbre changes even on an acoustic and will lend your ear a bit of that warm tone youre looking for. Check out where Joe Pass picksOr you could just forgo the electric and study Django Reinhardt,jazzguitar,d17i0oh,11,t5_2sfad

8871156,0,t3_51q3xl,Wow I was actually in the EXACT same situation two years ago. I was a freshman idk what you are going into a back to back state champion jazz band as a guitarist. At the time of joining I had been playing for something like  months total on the guitar. The most benefit was the guitar lessons. Just sit down with an expert and learn some things. As far as melody reading just write out the notes on the paper. I can technically read music but not on the spot so I usually write them out when I have time. Super interesting to read your post though as I was in an incredibly similar situation. Btw the year I joined was the one year my school was A so we ended up in rd place but last year we were A again and we took state. ,jazzguitar,d7e6rz5,1,t5_2sfad

9593381,0,t3_5c77pi,First of all sounds great. The thing that you did best is not overplay. It never felt like there were too many notes or any really showoff kind of lines. It was certainly melodic and articulate. It felt a little bit DjangoGypsy like to me. There was a lot of vibrato which could be a pro or a con depending on your goalideal sound. The bends also fit that gypsy vibe too. As far as critiques which is why youre here You are playing the notes of the scales correctly but the lines at times feel scalular not a word but you probably get it. Perhaps some more interval jumps and arpeggios would benefit. I heard SOME of that stuff but would have preferred more.  Sequencing! People can play a lot of great melodies but it doesnt mean much if they arent sequenced in a way that makes sense. Treat your lines like sentences. Try to relate one line to the next and develop into a story.  I think some bebop phrasing could help your vocabulary. Practicing outlining changes using arpeggios can really make you seehear lines in a different way. Improving your voice leading would give you some more harmonic bounce. Its kind of the next logical step once youve figured out how to outline changes using the parent scales. At the same time I dont like to over do it. Some guys play all bebop lines on a simple swing tune like this and it doesnt fit IMO. I think theres a balance that works best. Right now you have one end of the spectrum where you have a lot of organicnonnerdy kind of vocab which is great. If you nerd out a bit on some Charlie Parker youll get the other end of that spectrum! I know thats kind of a lot of words but I really genuinely think it sounds great. I really appreciate when players dont overdo it with too many licksruns. It shows a lot of maturity,jazzguitar,d9vkx0t,3,t5_2sfad

10608633,0,t3_5qx2wl,I had the same problem. Im currently playing for  years now and so many people told me I had to do ist all by my wrist what lead to tensioning up when i had to play standing fast or tried to really dig into a note. You shouldnt worry that much and tell yourself to be as relaxed as possible by only focusing what and not how to play something. My recent teacher told me you have to spread the motion all the way up to your elbow to get enough pressure on the strings. But not to much! the wrist does most of the motion. Try playing with these two approaches of wrist and ellbow movement and try to fade between them.I often think about concentraiting on a imaginary nail that sits in the end of my ellbow with its head pointing away from the guitar.
