71976,0,t1_cemm5j5,Ah true didnt take that into thought. It would certainly help to catalog the submissions at least by collecting them like that.

1259922,0,t1_cibbsgu,. The gif must be more than merely relevant that is the gif must contain more than one relevant element person action object facial expression metaphor etc.I actually did read this rule and I fail to see how my posting doesnt meet that criteria. It contains more than one relevant element in the context of the gif. Action object facial expression and the implied metaphor could all be considered in the gif. my post is still getting upvotes so obviously not everyone feels the same as the people that are commenting. Again dont like it downvote and move on. Until then if my post really doesnt meet the criteria then a mod can delete it. ,retiredgif,cibcup3,1,t5_2vltu
