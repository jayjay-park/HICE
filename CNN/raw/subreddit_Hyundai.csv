Correction my gas tank lid not cap wasnt very well connected and they ordered the part for me about two weeks ago it came in last week and wasnt painted so it just got back from paint today and let me know that I can go in whenever to get it put on.

4751718,0,t3_3c3lpy,I had this happen in my  Sonata and completely eliminated it for  bucks and in about  minutes. I used the Lysol method. Basically you run your engine run the AC at full blast with the outside intake vent setting on then spray Lysol across the entire intake vent ensuring that its getting into the actual intakes. Id say spray half a can across the entire vent then leave it for  minutes or so then spray the other half into the vent. On top of being antimicrobial and killing whatever is growing in your cooling system the fresh scent will stay in your AC for months. On top of this the suggestions in this thread about switching from AC to blower a couple of minutes before you get to your destination will help prevent it in the future. It dries out the moisture built up in the system that encourages microbial growth. But above all else do NOT run through a car wash or in the rain with the outside intake vent setting on. Switch to recirculate before entering a car wash or in the rain. The refresher kits do something similar to this Lysol method but for a lot more money.In reality I guess it was more than  bucks because I replaced my perfectly clean cabin air filter with a new one and it didnt do a damn thing for the smell.,Hyundai,ctthyyw,1,t5_2rde2

Easy fixes less than  for a coil  for the EGR switch and I dont recall how much the o sensor was.I will say these are very sensitive to the condition and type of spark plug you use.  Even with over  miles it idled stone cold smooth and near silent.  If I ever noticed a bit of a shake or stutter it was time for new plugs.

I also just swapped out the exhaust as well didnt want to swap the whole system out as it can get very expensive haha.  I looked at flowmaster magnaflow and megan racing before finally settling on the magnaflow. It makes a really nice hum when idling and doesnt sound anything like a weed whacker under acceleration It actually has a pretty loud roar that sounds awesome. You can see what it looks like i just posted my elantra on here a few days ago. Like you i just wanted the car to have a nicer sound and the magnaflow really makes your car sound sporty without being obnoxiously loud and waking up the whole neighborhood. If youd like i can record a video of my car revving idling and accelerating if you wanna hear what it sounds like.

Then they biffed the Aslan replacementnot replacement in Korea and let the Azera redesign wait.The Genesis brand will get a comparable FWD Lexus ES competitor under that brand. They dont want to compete against their own new Lux brand.,Hyundai,dghm7pp,2,t5_2rde2

Taking it to a dealership to see if this is covered under warranty. Purchased car in May  and only has  miles.,Hyundai,dgq5qcv,1,t5_2rde2
