1164270,0,t1_cf7eeac,Definitely but I dont think the point about cute names being given to essentially riot squads should not be missed.  I mean a rose by any other name and all that but call a duck a duck and a riot squad a riot squad.  Joint Multinational Readiness and Battlefield Surveillance Brigade are politicians words not the guy on the ground.When have you heard Assertive disarmament or  Coercive interrogation or Collateral damage or Dead checking or Expectant or Special Mission Unit or Liberation or Neutralize or Unlawful combatant.  I mean theyre all really nice for varying values of nice words that mean the exact opposite.  When has Liberation meant anything other than occupation?I dont know how this relates to  other than the use of euphemisms to describe war terms though... that... just seems like a reach.,Militarycringe,ci0lllb,1,t5_2x6bk
