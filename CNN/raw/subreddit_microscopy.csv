4245287,0,t3_39gjmm,I think you are making a mistake that most people make when they come from the world of photography to microscopy. Resolution in microscopy is not bigger is better. Its almost the first thing you have to unlearn. Have a look at the resolutions of some of the worlds best microscopy cameras they dont impress if you think MP is low res. Even on the super SUPER high end scanning confocal systems the Nyquist resolution for even the highest end objectives at the highest levels of quality mean you rarely go over x per field of view. So the question is what do you want to capture? Are you actually trying to go for some data acquisition or do you want pretty pictures? Thats not knocking pretty pictures btw thats all i am in the field for. Basically what is your goal? edit Also I just reread your post and another point is that your sensor is too large. The whole reason photography nerds go crazy over fullframe and MF is that they want paperthin DOF. This is what you dont want in microscopy that is why most good macro systems are crop. You dont get lenses like this on fullframe because it wouldnt have any DOF. So getting a microscope and putting a little decent PampS on it is not making a mistake because you arent using your D its actually going to be a better tool than your FF camera. ,microscopy,cs45izc,1,t5_2r43l
4708782,0,t3_3ff1f3,I would try googling plant cell or something along those lines then use the search tools to limit results to larger than mb. Two minutes found these if they help at all          EDIT Shutterstock gallerydirect or getty may also be good places to look.,microscopy,cto2w73,2,t5_2r43l
5114708,0,t3_3l0a0u,I used to sell Nikon. There cameras tend to only work with Elements. What model camera do you own? I can tell you if it will work on any other platform. ,microscopy,cv2ii25,1,t5_2r43l
5539130,0,t3_3qy9pr,There is an inverse relationship between resolution and working distance.  High mangification high numerical aperture lenses have a short working distance.  There are objectives designed for longer working distance but these lenses have lower resolution.,microscopy,cwjo7te,1,t5_2r43l
