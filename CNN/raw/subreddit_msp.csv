4552019,0,t3_3de6h2,You are spending money on support its just hidden.  If youre taking another employees time to do it its hidden in their salary.  There are maintenance activities that need to be done that if left undone build up liability and technical debt.  And really thats the biggest concern that I have with your statement.  Without any support you dont even know what kind of issues you have and what kind of response you would have to them.  Do you know what would happen if you had a cryptolocker infection?  Did you know about the recent Adobe Flash vulnerabilities that allow driveby installation of that sort of malware without any user interaction?  Do you know what sort of recovery plan is in place in case there were some disaster at your office like a flood or a fire?You have professional employees.  They make maybe k  k and upwards per year.  How often during the day do they use their computer systems the data on your servers the Internet?  If these things were to become unavailable this cost would be realized.  But what is that cost to determine that someone has to do some investigation.Our business is to discover this and prevent those sorts of issues.  We offer a professional service and we do it on a large scale so we can leverage that efficiency.  We have remote monitoring agents that can go on each of your systems that will alert us if theres something wrong.  Because we have a wide client base we get these tools at a good price and we can pass those savings on to you.  Similarly we have policies and procedures that allow us to monitor action and report on any issues we find.  These processes are industry standard and are a large focus of our business.   Because of our focus on this area we can offer these services to you for a very reasonable rate more affordable than if you were to try to build the same infrastructure from scratch.  Our costs are reasonable managing each station is only x per month a tiny fraction of an employees salary and if it enables them to avoid any loss of individual productivity on their own then that alone pays for the service.  However the most important part is that you will have confidence in how youre going to deal with those crises. Youll know that you have secure backups.  Youll know that the security of your network has been maintained.  Youll know that critical fixes have taken place on a regular basis.  And youll know this because each month well automatically email you a report that summarizes these things and it will be concise something that you can request more detail about or just glance at to know that things are OK and what weve done for you. In any case if you would like we are willing to offer a complimentary network audit to determine where there might be risks or room for improvement.  Once youve received the study you can verify the results yourself if you agree with the results wed urge you to reconsider the real cost of your current level of support. We have an engineer available to perform this audit with you two weeks from now.  Any day from the th to the st is available this is just preliminary and should take a few hours and he might need to speak with some users.

4790402,0,t3_3ghau2,Three things come to mind for me.ampnbspPricingInitial cost of the product is very high to get in to  especially for smaller MSPs. Smaller MSPs tend to have smaller customers for whom month is a much bigger issue. Adding markup just makes the price almost laughable when going up against your competitors. Small companies can have just as much data as large companies with just the same importance to protect it. Datto does its job well but at some point money matters and no amount of explaining where Datto beats the competition will overcome the customers inability to write that check. In general Datto seems a better fit for midtolarger companies than smaller ones but Datto seems to talk about itself as if its a good fit for everyone. Its not. The cost drives you out of smaller companies. Q How can you compete in the smaller market? A Roll Your Own BDR is a good place to start. About that...ampnbspGenesisGenesis is a good idea but it fails hard in the roll your own market. Genesis is in fact NOT focused at the roll your own market. Its focused at the use our competitors hardware and make it Datto market.  Its all EOL hardware that was used by your competitors in years past or were old file servers  hardware thats about to be replaced and would make an OK backup platform.Roll your own means I ought to be able to go down to my local parts store and grab almost any hardware and make it work. Frankly theres no reason I shouldnt be able to do that. If I can get a Windows OS and drivers to install why not let me throw on the Datto software and make it a BDR? ampnbspQuit playing marketing games and get real. Get serious about making Datto available to everyone everywhere on any hardware  even if its not your own. ampnbspOffsite BackupFor some customers cloud backup isnt an option due to cost regulations or stupid managers who dont trust online encryption etc.. Being able to automatically push local BDR data to an externally attached USB would be fantastic. Customer can then at least manually take data offsite. Yes it means you lose revenue from the cloud service. Yes its not as functional you lose online virtualization requires user involvement etc.. Yes there are a lot reasons to not use USB. But its better than nothing when the only option for offsite storage is anything thats not on the Internet. In my market my customers are very scared of the Internet. Everywhere they look businesses are being hacked into. You know what doesnt make the news? The frequency with which USB drives are hacked into. From my customers perspective if I can employ the same encryption on a USB drive as I can on the Internet and websites are hacked daily and USB drives are never hacked then USB is a viable option to them. Rather than fail to force a potential customer into your process and subsequently lose them to your competitor why not gain a customer with USB storage?Clarification With the USB Function Id like to see this automated as much as possible. Some sort of schedule that will push the data to the USB drive so the customer only has to swap the drives. I know you can manually tell the Datto box to push data to USB but automating it means my customer nor I have to log in to a Datto box to make it happen on a daily basis.,msp,ctydaux,5,t5_2slwq

Youll have to read the manual for the full configuration if you use the quick start guide APC assumes you have a domain controller outside of your virtual infrastructure and that you have VMware licensing for drs. But they dont mention those assumptions in the quick start guide.... I learned that one the hard way.If you dont have a management card then youll have to deploy a vma to the host and pass through a serial connection to the vma. The virtual appliance is the better option in my opinion.Also I recommend APC or cyberpower. Cyberpower has a virtual appliance that can communicate over USB.,msp,cua9tcv,2,t5_2slwq

So down the road when certain software gets out of the s and goes over to Bit well have to go back and do that over again. Office as a service has been a gigantic fucking headache.

5538166,0,t1_cwj4zu1,I often deploy pfSense for Small Business and it has worked out well for me.  I havent had many failures so just having a cold spare ready to go for any client failures is good enough.  If they want to pay for redundancy that is fine.  I dont see any use for unmanaged switches.  If a company is growing youll want managed switches for increased flexibility and possibly for stacking.  The other thing is if you are contemplating dumb switches you may be using switches all over the place to solve wiring issues.  Dont fall into that trap install the needed cabling and consolidate your equipment in a minimum of locations.  I agree Meraki is overpriced but if you can piece together a package they can trim quite a bit off the MSRP.  I think Meraki has a better interface and control panel and a stronger overall feature set.  I dont like the licensing model but I can see how it makes sense.  The Merakis are also much easier to configure for remote sites.  They are tools in the tool box and both should be considered.  I can see the appeal of Cisco and Meraki but you have to remember the overhead of certifications and certed employees especially if you are a small shop.  If your market sees the value in Cisco gear and the certs they should pay for themselves.  If they are just as happy with Fortigate pfSense etc they can be a serious anchor on profits.,msp,cwjjsc3,2,t5_2slwq

IE Franks Automotive Repair would have FAR and so on. This number is also the computer name for the asset which makes remote support easy as. We also use this same asset tag to label and assign all software licenses eg office licenses get labelled with the asset tag and the license is entered into our RMM tool under the asset notes.Other assets like servers switches and routers are labelled in a similar fashion. Servers would be FARROLE eg FARFS FARFS or FARDC. Switches get FARCS for core switches or FARES for Edge Switches. Routers get FARCR for core routers and FARSiteLocationER for edge routers eg FARNYCER.Printers get a similar naming convention  FARMODEL eg a Canon ir would be FAR etc.We stopped tracking some items like monitors purely because theyre not expensive in the scheme of things and at most sites they get moved around quite a bit which meant expending a significant amount of time just keeping track of them.In terms of an actual asset database we use our RMM tool  currently Naverisk. If its an MSP customer they have an active agent which we add the asset number too.

Surprisingly it has worked well and has taken a load off the Exchange Server since again its in the cloud.I have looked at others like GFI Max Focus etc.  But to me they all look similar and would rather get info from people that have used all these products and can better guide me.What I like about Trend is it has both Mail Security and Antivirus offerings that can be managed in the same place.  They have  support if I remember correctly.  I can purchase it through Tech Data.  It is designed for MSPs.  Monthly billing can change the license amount for each client each month. Etc...

6775211,0,t3_48ju56,Ive got some posts in rsysadmin where I tested all the dedicated SSL VPN solutions.The hands down best standalone VPN solution is Pulse Connect Secure form Pulse Secure.  This was originally Juniper Secure Access before Juniper spun off that unit to Pulse Secure.  Juniper hardware was MAG and SA series devices and Pulse Secure just did a refresh as PSA appliances.They offer it as a VM under a service provider license only but its pretty pricey.  The smallest physical appliance isnt cheap either . Youre looking at around k for the hardware and  simultaneous users smallest license purchase.For something lower cost Barracuda and SonicWALL would be the other options to consider.  I remember Barracuda had some key things missing in terms of granular control that I was looking for but this was also  years ago now so that may have changed.Its probably also worth looking at a low end FortiGate and using it just for SSL VPN.  They dont have peruser licenses the device itself is licensed with purchase to a max limit of the device itself.  While you dont necessarily needwant a full firewall just for SSL VPN they offer a really nice SSL VPN feature set and you can buy something low end like a D or E for ish and be good to go.  Youd basically size the device based on recommended max users and concurrent VPN based throughput needs.OpenVPN is a decent option overall but its a very limited SSL VPN solution compared to the other things Ive mentioned.,msp,d0k94yn,2,t5_2slwq

6894894,0,t1_d0x5yxp,Sorry i didnt explain very well. Lets take a typical scenario based on a real customer.  physical server running  r std   virtual servers  x DCfileprint amp  x RDS.In this scenario we would bill for the two virtual servers but not for the host. The host would still be monitoredmaintained and the hardware would be monitors as well. The host in this case does almost nothing except run hyper v. It does have the HP hardware management agents and also the UPS software. Were also currently running backups to USB drives from the host.The reason we dont charge for the host is we dont vary the charge between physical and virtual servers. So for example if it was two physical boxes instead of two virtual servers the charges would be the same but we would be doing more work as we would need to manage the hardware for two physical servers.Another way of looking at it is our server rate includes the OS hardware amp associated equipment. So if they have a hyper v solution with at least  virtual server theyre still essentially paying for the hardware to be managed already. The additional cost to us for an extra server licence of our RMM tool is next to nothing and staff time is minimal as well.One important thing to note is when we do a hyper v solution like this the host doesnt ever do anything important. So we dont build a hyper v host and run it as a file server. Its sole purpose is to be the hyper v host.,msp,d0xuryc,2,t5_2slwq

6964758,0,t3_4azven,Heres the thing In MSPBreakFix you have to build in some level of flexibility to suit the situation. Given that within the idea of assessing a system or network the depth of the assessment will probably be different in each case. Over the years for possible new clients I spend a great deal of time assessing the people more than the technology. For a prospective client that as asked for a very basic assessment I might not charge. If it was clear that company was trying to pump me for information I would offer little useful information but may also still not charge. If this is an existing client there are rarely cases I wouldnt charge for this kind of service. In a business where essentially every client and client need may be different from the next I dont think a one size fits all approach gets you where you want to be.,msp,d15shhz,2,t5_2slwq

7097636,0,t3_4cra4c,I used ServiceDesk Plus so can comment on that.  My experience is around two years old so Im not sure how much theyve changed since then.  The interface was great.  Easily customized within reason and not too cluttered.  The rest was soso.  Upgrading to new versions was always iffy with a lot of restoring to previous version.  It tended to take a lot of server resources even though I only had five people working in it so it would randomly grind to a crawl.  It has some interesting asset management portions that were nice but they seemed to always be out of date and didnt capture information I wanted.  For my environment it really suffered that it wanted to run inside its own web engine rather than IIS.  The database was a total mess too so if you needed to fix something on your own it was a few hours of hunting around to figure out their table structure.As far as normal work stuff it actually did quite well.  Entering processing closing tickets was pretty easy and I could changeadd fields.  The knowledgebase needed a bit of visual work but was usable.  The email notifications to techs and users were really nice and could be customized to a good extent.

It was one of the more difficult technical things to communicate and politically arduous to resolve because all along they were absolutely certain they didnt break anything so they were bad mouthing me to our mutual client. they think they are technical people because they run a cpanel for their shitty websites and write some code and that really inflates their ego.they ate their humble pie tho after i finally got them to make the changes i asked them to make and the problem went away. actually they didnt publicly eat humble pie but it was obvious they just derped out and stopped responding to the final resolution email summary for outage.,msp,d34y3nu,6,t5_2slwq

Hourly and AYCE obviously go through there.  It is nice to have other agreements subscriptions yearly renewals etc automatically show up to invoice.With all that said it is clunky I came from AT and their integration was a little smoother.  So what do you gainbenefit?  Please see my first paragraph.  Other thing if you do any QB invoices that werent generated by CW you have to make sure to change the Next invoice number or something like that otherwise youll get duplicate invoice numbers.  Can you do these things without it?  Yes absolutely in fact there are times when I want to kill it because the way it exports ticket information on invoices is so ugly our bookkeeper always goes through to sift through the noise and make it easier to readunderstand for the customer.  But that is with hourly clients to be honest.So...would I do it again?  The setup didnt take me much time to be honest even the CW consultant was surprised I did it right.  I dont think I would...having everything run through there because if its not in CW it never happened is nice but its too clunky feeling it has a sync option for QB to update CW but I havent done it because I dont have much faith in it and I dont want to mess up my QB file.Honestly Im looking at PSAs again.  Im just not happy with how clunky CW is...I love everything it can do...ON PAPER but in practice...ugh...just too frustrating.  When we were with AT we would invoice hourlys and contracts via the QB integration but that was also smarter way and smoother and any Quotewerks quotes would go through QW which was smooth as well.I dont know if that helped or just made things muddier.

Its a lesson Ive learned painfully for several years now. Im a terrible business owner.You can get something going in one of a couple of ways You can work your current job and maybe even another job while trying to start your business on the side. You use those jobs to fund your business development and try to juggle everything and give up on sleeping for a while and if youre lucky and youre good you can eventually make enough to make the switch to working for yourself fulltime. But youre still not done now you how to spend equal parts of your time working in the business fulfilling clients needs and working on the business finding new clients developing partnerships managing financials expanding services and offerings. This is the dumb way to do it. Its how I did it. Its very very difficult to ever grow beyond a tiny shop doing it this way  itll pay the bills but every day as you approach the age of  youll wonder if youll ever get to retire. You can come up with some startup capital and immediately switch to running your business full time and treating it like an actual business. This is how a competent business person would do it. It might be a loan might be savings might be credit or a windfall but either way you start immediately with enough capital to be able to pay the bills for at least two people for lets say six months. Maybe k? You have one strong tech person with a few other skills and one strong businesssales person with a few technical skills and the two of you hustle really hard to grow the business quickly.Ive got strong sysadmin and software development skills and almost enough management skills to run a business but not quite if I got a real job Id be making a lot a lot more money than I am now. Ive left probably hundreds of thousands of dollars easily on the table since starting my business.

If the client is using a EHR which is self contained does not cache local unencrypted data and there is no other phi on the device no phi has been disclosed to you by working on that equipment. The problem here is that this is not a typical scenario. Usually the workstation will have some degree of phi accessible by an IT vendor which makes them a responsible party scanned data is the most common one I see. ampnbspSimply doing work for a provider does not mean you have access to  phi its just very likely. ampnbspPeople also regularly misunderstand what a BAA is actually for. As the business associate you can be liable regardless of signing a contractBAA. It is the provider that is required to get a BAAContract from the associate and the provider who would be fined for not having one. Not adhering to standards can get the associate fined regardless of the BAA being in place. ampnbspI agree with much of the information uITthrowaway posted in that thread even if I think his lawyer is being extremely conservative in his assessment but that is his job.

9349115,0,t3_58cz9h,Hi madjeff We can appreciate your concern and do have an update for you on this.  There in fact was no leak of passwords out of our system as the alarming title of this post might portray but rather a feature built into our Windows Directory Service control which was a popular request from Partners. Our mistake in this feature release was fold  It was delivered in a default on configuration when it should be elected to use and  Our support team was not aware of the feature release.The feature itself was designed so that upon detection of a successful password change for a user within AD which does not exist or is not stored in Passportal we would autocapture and create it as a stored credential under the same client within our portal.  This was requested to ensure automated capture of any administrative credentials for autodocumentation and storage especially in the case where a rogue technician on your team might create a backdoor access account for clients.We have a new agent in QA with anticipated release tomorrow which will turn this functionality off by default and able to be toggled on within the local agent config on your client network should you so choose.I again appreciate your concern and respect the surprise that you must have been met with and greatly apologize for the breakdown in communication between our Windows Directory Service Development and Support teams.Our system is developed with stringent security protocols in place for a multitenant environment which would not allow for any cross client data access risk or data leakage.Should you have any additional questions or concerns please do not hesitate to reach out to our support team at supportpassportalmsp.com or our Partner Development Team at infopassportalmsp.com.,msp,d912glc,3,t5_2slwq

9809851,0,t1_daluzci,Im no Excel wizard so Im sure it could do a hell of a lot more.The problem with sharing it is that its built around our pricing model of per user per workstation per server and per site. I havent seen anyone else on rmsp use that specific structure before so Im not sure how valuable it would be to anyone without enough reworking that it may as well have just been recreated from scratch. Further the boss is saying I can only share it if I pull product names and pricing which I think is dumbwere not that special but a guys gotta eat and that would take enough time on its own that its not really worth it either. I probably couldnt do it without accidentally breaking a bunch of the formulas anyway.Heres the gist of how it worksTab  is the list of productsservices and their cost categorized by what section of the agreement it would fall under. Per endpoint items RMM AV etc Per user items  spam filtering per server items RMM Backup AV and Per site items. If were providing hardware the purchase price of that hardware is then calcd out as if we were paying for it monthly based on the duration of the agreement later tab. I list out everything that we might possibly use here and their respective costs. The hardware fluctuates enough that I have fairly general switch and UPS placeholders and I update that pricing each time Im quoting someone new.Tab  is the calculations of our cost per endpointserversite billing metric. It pulls over the descriptions of the various services from Tab  and if you put a Y next to it it pulls over the cost associated with that particular item. This tab also pulls in our expected dollar cost in labor hours for each item as well later tab. This is n ow able to provide our cost per metric item.Tab  is the user based version of tab . Same deal service descriptions are pulled in from Tab  a Y means it pull sover costs also pulls in our expected labor involvement and spits out total per user cost.Tab  is the labor calculator. I dont change this one hardly at all but its where our numbers for expectations of time spent per endpointuseretc per month are figured any additional builtin labor for meetings and what figure to use for calculating the labor dollar cost is.Finally Tab  is where all of this is centralized. We fill in the quantity of each metric and what we want to charge the customer. It then takes our perendpoint cost calculation tells us how we stack up including what our profit per individual metric is so we can see where our most expensive parts are mostly. It provides the customers total monthly cost what our margin on that is how many total hours we assume were spending and how many additional hours we can spend before we hit  profit margin dollar amount divided by hourly labor cost. The all in seat price total cost  total number of users. Then just to have the overview in one nice spot theres a field for the term of the agreement in months. This is what is used to calc the expense of the hardware items.I wish I could share it if only to have someone else spot check all of my formulas. It also assumes were buying a new hardware for each client that were providing one for so our margin calculator could be lying if we already owned the switch were providing. It does this on purpose so we should at least have the profit coming in to buy a replacement if we had to. Im happy to answer any additional questions anyone may have about it.,msp,dam9vvb,1,t5_2slwq

I am interested and will setup an account to try. I am sure it could do some good. I would find it useful but you are likely just relying on infections of others to then determine sites.

If my goal is reoccurring revenue I dont see the value of less money now for the sake of an extended liability.  Reduced rates should be in line with an agreement and applied towards outofscope work projects or an IT slush fund of sorts.  I feel a bulk hours offering might influence the customer into buying hours then put out fires or hand over a punch list that in my view is simply breakfix countering my goal as an MSP which in part is to guide the customer long term and adapt to technology over time.As the dude said Thats like your opinion man.

COMPENSATIONPeople will only work as hard as the benefit they receive from doing so! From reading your post I perceive you are the type of MSP boss who thinks a  hour a week employee should have  hours of billable time and still spend hours a week driving skipping lunch breaks working remotely at home doing maintenance after hours being on call etc.People will work like dogs for you and put up with the abuse as long as it is equitable for them!Imagine you are working at Mcdonalds at minimum wage already putting up with the bullshit that a horrible MCJOB comes with. Then one day your boss tells you I need you to go clean the bathrooms. You walk into the bathroom and some rude person smeared feces all over the walls urinated all over and destroyed the bathroom. At this point you think to yourself Im not getting paid enough for this... fuck this I quit.  However take that same employee and pay them appropriately to perform that disgusting job and they will jump at the opportunity to do so. For example if I hired you for K a year to shovel horse shit vs the low  figures you are most likely generating for yourself now as the owner there is no doubt you would start shoveling shit instantly!So you burned out and fried your best guy and by your own admission. You also havent stated one thing regarding to how you tried to prevent that person from leaving what you offered them to stay or how you value your people beyond what the Connectwise monthly metrics tell you.If your guys require more training and more baptism by tech support fire then make it worth their while. Why dont you think outside the box and tell your people that you acknowledge these issues and that you are beyond grateful for their work ethic and not only are you working tirelessly to mitigate the situation but during their heavy strain you will be compensating them at a higher rate or a bonus until such time that the work load normalizes and your new strategies can be put in place and proven to be effective for all parties.

11740928,0,t1_dgqd8eb,I dont mind a call to discuss the product before getting pricing but some vendors are just crazy.  Im now going on my h or th meeting with an av vendor.  I just want pricing but now have a demo setup because they wont give pricing before doing a demo.  So I setup a test environment for them they wanted me to just load their products on a bunch of production systems and we had he callmeeting where I thought they were going to give me licenses and access.  NOPE!  This was the call to set our expectations and determine acceptance criteria which for some reason cant happen at the same time.  We were going to need to have another callmeeting to actually get the demo deployed.  Then a few weeks after that we would have a meeting to review.  Then after that we would start talking about pricing.  Way too much work Im just going straight to my var from now on.,msp,dgqv47n,3,t5_2slwq

If you have to support anything they do to their systems even if not approved by you youre probably stuck but if you disclaim responsibility for administrative changes done by the customer without your knowledge or consent you have a pretty strong case that you dont support stuff when the other company screws it up.,msp,dgtmpp6,8,t5_2slwq
