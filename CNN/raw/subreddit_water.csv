2349655,0,t1_cm1umuj,Agreed.  Our water systems are vulnerable and the industry is very slow to change.  In Canada water systems are typically owned and operated by municipalities and therefore are funded solely by taxpayers.  Most systems in British Columbia have very low flat rates for water and connections are not metered so people are not encouraged to conserve water.  This has resulted in overtaxing of water supplies aging infrastructure lack of redundancy lack of advanced treatment processes in smaller communities delays in implementation of smart technologies such as real time water quality monitoring and an insecure water distribution system that is susceptible to contamination or failure during disasters....the status quo that is dutifully protected by the old guard needs to be replaced with new ideas.,water,cm24mrl,4,t5_2qjvw

3790439,0,t1_cqo8tmn,OK Im not an expert in geology or water science but I do work in such an area. I would guess that there is a particular layer of porous rock in the contaminated zone going above or below this seems to fix the problem so it has to do with the particular stratification of the earth  rock in this area.,water,cqoc9b2,3,t5_2qjvw
3842235,0,t3_34fqed,This is an important topic. Though the concepts were there this is poorly written IMO.Heres a TLDR with additions Sewage and storm drain water are combined by our cities plumbing design Water treatment plants are overwhelmed during storms bc cost dictates that they be built for everyday sewage  runoff volumes not storm volumes Rain gardens reduce the amount of stormwater sent to treatment plants Benefits are     . Cleaner water since         untreated sewage may be released when input stormwater volume exceeds treatment capacity and          rain gardens trap and filter some pollutants    . Increased efficiency of treatment less clean water mixed in with sewage which needs to be reseparated    . Less demand placed on treatment plant wear amp tear filter replacement deferred maintenance    . Reduced likelihood of needing expanded treatment facilities    . Groundwater is replenished as water infiltrates rather than being pumped into the ocean as often happens,water,cqu8yo1,6,t5_2qjvw

8074027,0,t3_4pb7gd,I am a Waukesha resident. Im also typing this on my phone so my apologies for bad grammar.Waukesha County is part of both the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Basin. This meant that they could apply to acquire Michigan water per the terms of the compact. If you are outside the basin you are SOL. Waukesha county also spent  years on the water request  of which was conducting sustainability tests and  years was negotiations on top of having to spend time constructing the pipes. Petitioning the council is a last resort option that very few if any counties will attempt to do.Waukesha is in a unique situation. Waukesha draws water from an aquifer that is covered by a limestone layer. This means that groundwater cant refill the aquifer and that it takes a long time to recharge. The aquifer also has large radium contents as the county has to draw from such a deep area. Any radium filtering options would be temporary at best and would cause the problem of having to dispose of the radium. Essentially Waukeshas only option for a sustainable future was the lake.The lake will not be impacted at all by this. Waukesha is restricted to drawing . million gallons a day and must return all of it. Chicago meanwhile draws . billion gallons a day and doesnt return a drop.,water,d4nlhmr,1,t5_2qjvw

8600001,0,t3_4xm3g2, million gallons is really a drop in the proverbial bucket.  For context... it takes  gallons of water to fill one average size swimming pool. Youre describing reservoirs.  Most man made lakesreservoirs are there to provide flood control and to store water.  They are measured in acre feet one acre of water one foot deep or  gallons.For instance San Francisco gets it water from a dammed up river valley The Hetchy Hetchy Reservoir in CA has a capacity of  acreft.Most water scarce areas already capture flood water in reservoirs.  The real problem is conveying water from water rich areas to water poor areas.  Its expensive and politically challenging.  Also there just are not too many water rich areas willing to share.At  miilion gallons youre talking about only a little over  acreft.... a drop in the bucket,water,d6gld0v,12,t5_2qjvw
