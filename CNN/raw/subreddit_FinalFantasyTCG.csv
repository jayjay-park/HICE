8773407,0,t3_509cda,We definitely hope so. I think if Weiss Schwarz and Force of Will can stick around so can Final Fantasy.It would be smart for them to introduce Final Fantasy XV and perhaps even Kingdom Hearts to it in the future but I think the most important thing is community outreach. The game is supposed to launch in a month and we really dont have TOO many details about that but hopefully that changes after launch. Perhaps they will see the community really involved with their game and will decide to increase support for it.Or maybe they are just keeping a really secret launch so it goes viral or something who knows.I know the community for it will start off strong though and thats a good thing.,FinalFantasyTCG,d72cc4f,3,t5_3g2mp

10310662,0,t1_dcbw2zj,The turn player gains priority at the end of each phasestep and each time an effect gets added to the stack or an effect on the stack is resolved. The nonturn player gains priority when the turn player passes priority. When the nonturn player passes priority the top item on the stack is resolved. If the stack is empty the game moves to the next phasestep instead.Both cases are correct though strictly priority works slightly differently.

11108522,0,t3_5ymb9a,The timing is the critical thing here. If you want to use Leviathan on Squall it has to happen before damage resolves so Squall will not deal any combat damage to Prishe. Prishe would still take the k from Squalls ability though. Also as Prishe was declared as a blocker it would have gained k to now be a k with k damage marked on it.Then when Sephiroth attacks if Prishe blocks again she will gain another k and become k with k k damage on it. Sephiroth will deal k first strike to Prishe but this only puts her at k k damage so she survives. Then she would break Sephiroth.Edit Forgot to answer you other question about the Squall that was discarded. Any cards that are discard for costs or to generate CP will stay discarded regardless of what happens later on in the stack or turn. In this case the Squall was discarded to pay for Squall ability and is now in the Break Zone. The fact that the ability didnt end up doing anything because Squall was sent back to hand does not impact this.,FinalFantasyTCG,der53g2,2,t5_3g2mp
