A stupid function Ill admit but I can see where it comes in handy. You may have been rejected for a number of reasons but the most likely of them is that we perform a player inspection for every request and that elder felt that you didnt pass it. This inspection includes viewing the players base and profile and looking for certain achievements and such. If you felt like your rejection was unfairly done we can always take a look again and possibly have you join us. Thank you for your understanding and happy clashing! ,RedditInfinity,ck6ky9i,3,t5_2zn0s
