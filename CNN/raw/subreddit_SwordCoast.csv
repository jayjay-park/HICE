3507054,0,t1_cpe3gcg,I totally agree. But they should also implement some sort of rating system either an automated system based on calculable statistics overall life lost player deaths party wipes value of loot found etc a player based rating system a like button with secondary rating options for various statistics or both! This should help players determine if their DM is fair easy or too hard.,SwordCoast,cps125h,2,t5_36ngk

5492186,0,t3_3q7j73,SCLs plot is pretty linear and unfortunately it doesnt support a lot of interesting interactions like taking NPCs prisoner. Conceptually it seems pretty simply but speaking as a programmer thats a ton of code that only a small subset of players will touch so theres not a lot of return on investment.That said Playing Chaotic Evil and murdering everyone in the game seems to be the way to get the best results out of the game.,SwordCoast,cwdof7f,1,t5_36ngk
5493522,0,t3_3qbkre,The DLC is not Day  content. It should be released in some unspecified time in the future generally expected by the SCL community to be around December which may be optimistic or early Q.We know very little about it at this point. ,SwordCoast,cwdukmp,2,t5_36ngk
5498123,0,t1_cwee3bl,I am really not sure.Question is  . Is the game hosted at the computer of player that DMs or starts the game Or is it hosted at random player PC. . If player that doesnt host the game has bad connection does it also slows the game down ?,SwordCoast,cwefqzj,1,t5_36ngk

5695147,0,t1_cx2o4qg,Ive played it through as multiplayer with a bunch of friends and its pretty radical multiplayer. What specifically about multiplayer did you not like?  Is it a problem that could be caused by playing with strangers? The solution to that one would be get some friends to play with. Or just get some friends in general.  Dont be a jerk like you were above. There are polite ways of saying you dont like multiplayer that might be constructive for the makers so that they are encouraged to fix the problems. Stating it like you did above is going to make them not want to fix it. ,SwordCoast,cx31de4,1,t5_36ngk
6806750,0,t3_3zxcyy,This game is one I was so looking forward to and then it came out with a lot of lacking features and tons of undelivered promises. Then they gave us a little bit of light promising us  updates that would fix and deliver on the promises. Now this. Never again will I trust this studio. I advise those to stay  very far away from RoD.,SwordCoast,d0nu9ql,1,t5_36ngk
7102104,0,t3_4cj2ej,Im sorry if this offends anyone but Im honestly glad. The game was not what I expected at all and it was I dont say this often barely playable.In the time it took me to test the campaign maker I found out what it was all about but exceeded the amount of time of which you can no longer refund the game so Im stuck with this shitty  purchase. Their game was terrible and their response was terrible I dont care for them as a company at all.Im glad to see laziness in game development actually having some consequences and I hope to see more with the bigger guys in the future as well.,SwordCoast,d1le9j6,4,t5_36ngk
8702127,0,t3_4z60k9,I may be mixing my games because I havent played in a while. But Im pretty sure there is cool down reduction gear. You can stack it to have no cool down if Im not mistake.  ,SwordCoast,d6ted2w,2,t5_36ngk
