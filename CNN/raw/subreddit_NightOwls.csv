7194346,0,t1_d1vx8sk,Not much just noodling about. I was going to say that I spent a lot of years with very late nights and IRC chat channels helped a lot  particularly ones based in other time zones or ones which were large enough to have a  contingent of chatters. I even ended up flying around the world to meet some of them years later.,NightOwls,d1vxs5k,3,t5_2s3ib
7220607,0,t3_4ea5g0,Yeah uuhh... no matter how much you love darkness you should always get some sunlight even if that means sleeping with the window shades drawn because any sunlight is better than nothing.If you dont then you need to find your vitamin D elsewhere.  Human skin can make large amounts of vitamin D when lots of skin is exposed and the sun is high in the sky. Your body is designed to get the vitamin D it needs by producing it when your bare skin is exposed to sunlight. ,NightOwls,d1yxf1j,2,t5_2s3ib

10247027,0,t3_5mk1e3,I love staying up late because its the most time to myself I can get out of a day. I love the feeling of being able to do what I want at night without having people interrupting me. Night time is also when I sometimes just talk to myself I know it sounds weird. Night time is also when I like to think to myself like thinking on the toilet stuff.,NightOwls,dc5k2p6,3,t5_2s3ib
10519579,0,t3_5qmult,From someone who has worked nights for three years who hails from a medium sized city with plenty of night jobs I can say that...its still very difficult. I know where you come from. I can go to the local diner by myself and what make a conversation with my waiter? Or to the Casino and what make conversation with the slotter next to me? Finding physical  contact is easy but physical connections are harder for the night owl.So naturally I have a lot of online friends. While at work I text whoever is awake and have made friends overseas. Its not the same as going bowling but its a voice in the night to keep you sane. I spend time on forum boards and video games making friends or connections wherever I can.,NightOwls,dd0iaqu,6,t5_2s3ib

Recently I noticed that living the full night going to bed at  am was just not so good for both work and fun while working and relaxing until am is better,NightOwls,dfjio9b,1,t5_2s3ib
