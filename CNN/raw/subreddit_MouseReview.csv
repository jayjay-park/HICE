239994,0,t3_1wti1t,First you said that you cant afford much so please give us a budget. Second a keyboard is more important in a MOBA than a mouse as you really dont need too much precision to select targets unlike a FPS. I think your hands are too big for the XornetSpawn so please give us a grip style and whether you prefer ambidextrous or righthanded shape.  If you need a cheap mechanical keyboard I recommend the monoprice ones.  Link ,MouseReview,cf5mkst,2,t5_2vlxi

1471336,0,t3_2b0err,With mice your primary concern is always shape since this is the main interaction you will be having while using a mouse. If possible try out both mice and pick the more comfortable one and return the other. Otherwise or if you prefer to look into featuresquality Logitech is a reputable brand for the most part. The sensor on G is known to have no acceleration angle snapping or any of the other common sensor defects. G is known as such as well should you choose that instead since its just one more wire My recommendation would therefore be either the G or G but again shape should be your primary concern.,MouseReview,cj0ph35,3,t5_2vlxi

2599122,0,t3_2pljzl,Great video but there might be issues with posting your own youtube content on the sub! The issues Ive had with the mouse are the wheel Forwardbackwardthumb placement weight and possibly the feet. Initially the clunkiness of the wheel really disgusted me it was far too heavy and with it having no rubber my index finger would slip without actually scrolling. But after using the mouse for a few months Im very happy to report it has become a nonissue for me dare I say I prefer it to light rubbery wheels. I can only describe it as switching from keyboard MX redsbrowns to MX greensbuckling springs light actuation to heavy actuation initially make mistakes but over time it feels natural.  The forwardsbackwards and thumbsnipe button are very irritating. If my thumb is rested on forwardsbackwards the sniping button is too far forwards and I must slide my hand up the mouse to use it. Then when rested on the snipe button the forwardsbackwards are too far back and I must slide my hand down again to use them. I cant help but feel it would be incredibly more comfortable if the buttons were closer to each other like this On their own the buttons are fantastic perfect size and shape.  The weight is another issue the most frequently voiced. It is a very heavy mouse. There must be some way Logitech couldve shaved off some weight and allowed heavier weights to be added giving a larger tolerance. gg instead of gg surely wouldve been great for palm and claw users. This is unfair to say though because it is probably impossible and Ive no idea how the mouse is made but that would be ideal for a perfect mouse.  Oh yes the feet. As you said in the video theres no direct issue here but it is rather disconcerting. The PTFE is very thin and because of the pads are numerous wacky shapes instead of  circles there might be a great chance they could fray. I have used my G a few months and they are absolutely fine so far but yeah watch out.There are so many glaring issues with the mouse and the current trend of gaming being used as an adjective instead of a verb is pretty disgusting and because of that the mouse looks extremely vulgar and...unnecessary. But it is somehow still my favourite mouse to date.,MouseReview,cmxubzy,3,t5_2vlxi

3371724,0,t1_cpckt1u,agree with most of that except i wouldnt say the logitech  is the best. if anything there have been more complaints about that sensor mistracking than the zowies or DA chromas.also want to add i cannot tell much of a difference playing at dpi on both eca and DA chroma. ive tried making them mistrack by swiping extremely quickly and i have never gotten that weird sensor motion where the crosshair suddenly points straight up or straight down on either of them.the DA does have a slightly higher liftoffdistance but i believe you can lower it a little bit in synapse making the difference next to nothing.if having a tailoredfit dpi is important to you the deathadder all the way since synapse software makes that happen. you can even uninstall synapse from your system once you have your mouse settings all set up! the zowie only comes in preset dpi settings which might not satisfy you. not important for me but hey who knows.last point the eca rolls over a bit if you apply enough pressure downwards and to the side at the same time. the edges along the bottom are rounded out and the mouse feet are comically large and stops short of the round edges. the DA chroma has pretty well placed mouse feet albeit very small and has a nice defined edge so no rolling over there. not specifically a sensor comparison but its somewhat relevant.,MouseReview,cpclnmd,2,t5_2vlxi

4870282,0,t1_cu8e3ke,gt I want to know how the sensor performs is there accel jitter do all polling rates work well all backed up by dataThe best source of this information is always going to be places like OCN. Im glad we have a whole community that deepdives on technical performance but I dont think its what every review should be focusing on.gt So a good review for you is someone just talking about the basic specifications listed on the manufactures websiteBasically all of what Dazed said in his review is either experiential or completely subjective so Im not sure why youd say hes parroting manufacturers specifications.He goes into so much more than whats available on a mfg website e.g. what happens to the base of his palm when he uses the ZA idiosyncrasies of the Rivals shape why fabric cords can be bad. These are things that most reviewers dont think to talk about but are still really important. Personally I dont think he goes into enough detail about some parts of his experience like why the FM side buttons dont work well for him hard to reach? hard to press? mushy? or why the Zowie feet are the best smoother glide with greater friction? rounded edges dont catch on mousepad fibers? and completely skips over some things that he has good opportunities to talk about like sensor position and comparing rubberized surfaces e.g. Rival to hard plastic e.g. FM but I still think hes at least talking about the right things.If Im seeking out a specific persons review of something as opposed to things like communitysourced technical data or long term durability observations I do want to hear about personal preferences and experiences. I think thats exactly what a review like this is for. I dont agree with the notions that a nontechnical review is useless or that personal experience because it wont be the same for everybody is not worth listening to.,MouseReview,cu8fpsv,3,t5_2vlxi

5875325,0,t3_3vqdul,There are two viable mice you can go for. The Razer Taipan or the Logitech . The Razer Taipan is pretty much a direct upgrade to the Abyssus Abyssus is pretty much a budget Taipan. The shape is pretty much the same however the Taipan is bigger but with a more durable sensor and extra buttons. The G on the other hand is a bit smaller then the Abyssus but has a much better sensor then the Taipan. Pretty much the Taipan is an upgraded bigger Abyssus while the G is a smaller Abyssus with an extremely good sensor. To match up with what you want. Taipan has a similar shape G has similar size and the G has the best sensor out of all the three. Id personally recommend a g because of the better sensor and Similar size but it is always good to research yourself. Also I have some questions. Do you play palm claw or fingertip grip? and what surface is your mouse on when you play softpad hardpad desk etc? Taipan G Abyssus for comparison,MouseReview,cxpsbwc,1,t5_2vlxi

This zip has both firmware updater and configuration program.The firmware has to be updated first and that software only works in Windows  since for some reason it bugs out on Windows .Once you update the firmware the configuration software becomes usable on all Windows OSes and there is one thing to note everytime you change an setting like a different DPI or a different command to a mouse button it autosaves that to internal mouse memory.the SAVE button in the configuration software is redundant it doesnt do anything as the software autosaves it anyway.Yes its a bit of a hassle but its worth it for the best lefty mouse you can get these days.,MouseReview,cy4w0r3,2,t5_2vlxi

6302617,0,t1_cz5vnlh,I think you mean    clicks but I think youll be fine for playing on every weekend. I play dota  almost every day and each game you spam the right click button for hours. So thats why Im reluctant to buying the ducky secret if the switches die out pretty fast.I have a razer deathadder black edition for  years now never had any issues with it and only just recently the right click button died. I never had any double clicking issues either. Also note that I have  hours on the game and played it since I had the mouse. Now Im not sure if this is right but the switches that the razer deathadder black edition uses is the omron dfcfn which is rated at  million clicks. So I think in comparison to the switches for the razer deathadder to the ducky secret the ducky secret will die out within a year or  of super intensive gaming. Although if you dont play as much it should last you a LOT longer.,MouseReview,cz61bnr,2,t5_2vlxi

6427579,0,t3_43h0s3,The sensor itself is soldered on the PCB as expected and doesnt move around. However the mouse IS registering movement when the transparent lens is rattling which it does.I recently ditched my G due to me craving for a more lightweight  smaller mouse. Apparently I got stuck with the old G revision because I instantly noticed my Windows cursor deviating from my expected position every time I accelerated and stopping my mouse from moving. The common tape trick works excellent and my cursor has not moved a single pixel out of the expected location I want the cursor to be in.I would like to stress on the fact on how important it is ltbgtnotltbgt to use anything thicker than paper width.First of all it is not necessary as the transparent lens and the bottom of the mouse will squeeze the tape anyway and thus holding both pieces together when tightening the PCB onto the mouse with the corresponding bolts.If you use too thick of a material both the PCB and the bottom of the mouse will slightly bend resulting in the mouse starting to wobble from left to right due to the fact that the two V shaped mouse feet will expand outwards.Either way I would suggest to take the two V shaped feet off if you have a proper flat cloth mousepad because other than collecting dust I do not think they serve any purpose then.All in all theres no need to RMA the mouse per se if you dont care about warranty. I must say though this is a huge oversight on Logitechs part and this issue should warrant a replacement program. BAD QampA I bet no Logitech employee ever tested this product.p.s. There is a neat tool to check how accurate your sensor is assuming you use a good mousepad the accuracy should be around . Before I applied the tape trick the accuracy was somewhere around  which is just bad.Now it is ..Its called Enotus Mouse Tester,MouseReview,czk5e2q,2,t5_2vlxi

My SS Rival s sensor never gave me any issues you may have a defective unit I simply cant get mine to spin out.

Ive gave my FM   months to see if Id become acclimated and never did.

Their only difference from the BlackWhite is the color and the scroll wheel White   steps Red   steps.If youre comfortable with the Death Adder but find it too big Id suggest an ECA because of its similar shape but smaller form factor.

I found the mice to be too heavy and its painful after a long gaming session and I developed a tendinitis a few months ago Games FPS mainly Overwatch and some CSGO. Mostly hitscan specifically. Hand Right Handed I have never tried ambidextrous mice but I think I can be okay with it. Budget No budget EU. Hand size  cm length . cm middle finger and around  cm wide. Grip Palm grip. Sensitivity Low. cm user. I have a huge mouse pad too since I do long swipes. Weight All Zowie mices are much lower weight than G so Im not very worried about it. Pictures Here are some pics of my grip and hand size on my g. I would say my hand fits okay but Im not too sure honestly.  Details I have read the FK series are more for a claw grip and since I feel my grip is very palmy I like to have the mice very well grabbed I was doubting between the EC and the ZA series because my decision is being based mostly on the shape of the mice. The EC series seem flatter and the ZA seem much curvier on the top. I have no idea which one to pick and also because of my palm grip and my small finger  cm and  cm hand I dont know what dimensions will suit me better. I dont have any place to try them out so I need to make a good decision.Im also open for other nonZowie suggestions so I can look them up I have heard of fnatic gear flick and finalmouse but I havent read good things about the latter regarding the quality of it.Sorry for the long post but I wanted to go into detail since I really want a proper answer to stop my wrist pain.

9207020,0,t3_56gcr6,It would help if you listed what you recently used and what you have used in the past. x . cm I assume so length wise we are similar but width I am at roughly . cm or  inches.I would suggest taking a look into the Zowie FK lineup specifically the FK. If you prefer a heightened shell on the back for your palm the ZA.Also Logitech G Pro is also a solid option and its obviously been a hot topic due to its recent release.After testing the G Pro against other mice that I have its just too slippery for me personally.The sides coating is what ruins it for me the shape is obviously very safe and very forgiving for all grip styles.If youre looking for something larger in all aspects look into the G.The coating feel and buttons are solid IMO better than the G Pro.I wouldnt suggest changing grip style just for a mouse unless you dont mind the relearning process just IMO.Those  are what I believe solid starters to read up on and perhaps try out before buying.A few potential quality control issues e.g. mouse wheel rattle on the G first batches some rattling on G Pros here and there so buy from somewhere you can easily return.Hope this helps.RegardsAlso I would follow Overclock.netthey are even more picky.EDIT Also I would look into the G if you want a mouse you can really maneuver aroundits shape is hit or miss.Good for small hands like mine.I personally loved it and still use mine.,MouseReview,d8j246w,5,t5_2vlxi

Most if not all of them have side buttons to navigate through sites and have different dpi settings so you can move the cursor around with minimal movement. The main reason csgo players like Zowie mice is because the sensor and mouse feet are one of the best but other than that its really a simple mouse made for performance so if youre looking for something with more features i.e. RGB lighting macro buttons infinite scroll wheel then there are plenty of cheaper options out there for you.,MouseReview,d8rfa3h,1,t5_2vlxi

Only cons of eca is flimsy sidebuttons loud scroll it feels really good to the touch tho full silcon my nd fav scroll after microsoft . in terms of feeling to the touch and weird coating on which my hands sweat alot even tho it remains somewhat grippy  its really weird feeling and i dont like it at all im gonna fix it with grip tape personally. Shape m m clicks huge teflon feet and light rubber cord  all superb and make this mouse one of the most comfortable mice ive used in  years highly recommend.

A games sensitivity slider adjusts how large or small of an angle you rotate per each count received from the mouse. Lowering sensitivity produces finer changes per count. Once that angle becomes smaller than a pixel on your screen you stop pixel skipping. However you dont cease to continue gaining fineness as you lower sensitivity even further. ,MouseReview,dbhzryg,1,t5_2vlxi

10191857,0,t1_dbzai5h,Its a downgraded clone actually. The sizes are exactly the same. Its the same exact shape and retains the same dimensions. The GG are meant to be budget friendly mice. Im no marketing expert but I personally think Logitech released the G to keep the G Pro afloat on its  price tag. The G Pro is technically better than the G. Funny thing that is as Inos review of the GG shows that their  DPI sensor inside the GG is almost on par with the  DPI sensor within the G Pro.The G Pro is hence technically better than the GG and comes with more features. Why the quotations around the word features? Surface tuning is something you can live without on your GG. Its one of the features removed from these mice. Trust me no one in the right mind uses surface tuning. Another missing feature is the Gs rubber cable. Its meant to be a downgrade yet it only removes the hassle with stubborn braided cables. The Omron switches have a lower rating  Million instead of  Million.Overall same shape and size. Difference is the sensor cable switch rating no option for surface tuning and cheaper pricing. You really wouldnt be missing out on much. Sadly no smaller size will be available. I think the current shape is small enough for my claw grip.,MouseReview,dbzaxqd,2,t5_2vlxi

10852966,0,t1_ddzeddb,Theyre very different shapes. Thats about all I can say on it. I like the ECA and hate the FK. The RMB on my ECA feels lighter than the LMB. I think its just due to shell design. I never had problems with accidentally clicking RMB though but I did when I tried the ECA. Altered my grip due to the larger size and the shell seemed more flexible since there was a longer lever to bend so the clicks felt a lot lighter. Might just be something in the way you grip the mouse that causes the accidental clicks.,MouseReview,ddzenci,1,t5_2vlxi
10858305,0,t3_5v7ued,Well written review. Kinda puzzles me whats going on over at Steelseries between the Rival   and . The  has a great shape but feels very very cheap i mean it is a cheap mouse but somehow feels even cheaper than it should. The  is obviously targeted towards MMO players and i have not tried it myself but i have also never seen anyone use one or recommend one. The  again puzzles me they made a slightly smaller  which is great but then they add gimmicks that makes no sense a LCD screen on a mouse is probably the last thing anyone needs  it adds a ton of weight.Would be nice if companies making mice would start focusing on what people actually want a good sensor a good shape etc.,MouseReview,ddzyhg5,3,t5_2vlxi

Its smaller than the ones you listed at in x in x .in but I play csgo at edpi and have no issue with space.  The stitched edges are also a nice touch that will keep it from getting frayed.

11616882,0,t3_6562t3,This Is all subjective to the types of games you play.Shape  Personally I alternate between Claw and Fingertip depending on the mouse Im currently using everyone is different thus a particular shape wont fit all hands and everyone has their own definition of what feels Comfortable.Coating  So long as the sensor is good enough  or equivalent IMO then its not as important same as shape everyones hands react differently to different coatings over different periods of time. For instance my g and deathadder both feel slippery in the hand with even a little sweat after an hour of gaming or two however my cougar m feels fine in the same amount of time. Personally Im more fond of a rubber coating on the sides and cable and a more plastic coating on the top of a mouse. Weight   Once again everyone is different and weight is one of the biggest factors in a mouse that can either make or break a persons performance IMO. If a mouse is too light there is a big possibility of consistently overshooting a target or more mouse drag due to the cable tugging the mouse and if too heavy not only will hand fatigue set faster but you run the risk of undershooting your targets as well as higher potential for RSI especially if your a low sens player. personally Im in the crowd that prefers a mouse thats not too light Above  grams w some cable but not too heavy either Below  grams w some cable.Thanks for the Giveaway TeamROCCAT!,MouseReview,dgcs88q,1,t5_2vlxi
