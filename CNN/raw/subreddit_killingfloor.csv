There are beginning to be a lot of weapon packs out there too but look at how long the game has been active. Ive always felt excited to buy the DLC not burdened to like other games.

The weapons are fun to play with and the weapon  character skins add something different to look at which is nice. I also buy shirts and stuff from Tripwire which actually cost more than Killing Floor at full price but I dont mind at all. I work full time and have the money to support a great company so when Tripwire comes out with Killing Floor related I just say take my money pretty much haha.And you know what I can understand if you are a newer KF player and dont want to spend the dosh for extra stuff but please dont insult Tripwire  and KF fans  by saying you will give them five bucks to support them but then turn around and say that you refuse to buy anything else for the game.

1492278,1,t3_2b9yu6,Improve realism.. Add a chamber count to guns that have chambers. That means that a guns current ammo should be listed as  mags  the  is what denotes that there is a round in the chamber. The ONLY gun that the current system makes sense with is a revolver and single shot guns such as the Mxbow.. With that change you should add the ability to top off a gun by loading in a fresh magazine. IE loading in a new magazine after a round has been chambered will make the gun .. Stop using a magical magazine system. The current system that simply counts bullets unused and equates them to magazines. In short magazines should work like they do in reality. If all of your magazines have bullets fired from them your character should prioritize using the magazine with the most bullets currently in it. Furthermore picking up an ammo pack should not magically fill up all of your magazines a bit it should replace your lowest magazine.. Bullets dont fire in straight lines. They never have and most likely never will unless you can fire them in a vacuum absent of any gravity.Bullets like arrows fly in parabolic arcs. This means that the sight of a gun is only accurate at  points in the trajectory.Adding this fact in would really improve the game especially in regards to how well it would illustrate damage fall off for guns like shotguns.. Bullets have effective ranges you guys kinda illustrated that by creating spread in guns like the shotgun but in regards to everything but crossbow bolts and arrows the second a bullet leaves the barrel its kinetic energy is decaying. This really should be reflected in its damage.. STOP BUTCHERING PUMP ACTION SHOTGUNS D If a shotgun is empty loading shells into the bottom does not magically allow it to fire without cycling the action. The best solution to creating pump action shotguns accurately is to add in a second reload animation AND to ensure that when the final shell from the shotgun is ejected that the character leaves the action in the rear position.If the shotgun is completely empty characters should do what is called a side load  which is where a shell is quickly and directly loaded in through the ejection port only available on side ejecting pump action shotguns of course and the shotgun is cycled forward and ready to fire. If a round is in the chamber the next presses of a reload key should load shells into the tubular magazine.Side loading is demonstrated in the first  seconds of that video.. Shared ammo pools. For example if youre going to make all of the shotguns accept  guage ammo it doesnt make sense that that ammo cannot be used between guns. If you want to ensure that weapons do not share ammo types this can be accomplished by choosing your guns wisely so that they do not share bullet types. A good way to do this would be to this in the case of shotguns would be to create instances that support the fact that shotguns can only fire that specific type of ammo like  gauge shells or . shells which can be used to explain damage differences  after all a  gauge shell is a  gauge shell and changing its damage by changing its kinetic force by changing its gun makes little sense . Blurring front sights while the character is aiming. In real life you aim your gun past the sight you never focus on the sight itself this should be reflected rather than creating sights that block your vision.. Grenade pressure waves. Basically you should give the characters some tinnitus for being near a grenade blast and the windows should take damage from much further away.. Pump action shotgunsside by side shotguns hit harder than semi automatic shotguns due the the fact that they are not inertia driven. The difference is minimal but it is there.. Give people a level of control in the starting weapon they get access to at level . consider add a sprintshove ability for the berserker class. lower the healing needed to level a medic by  and add a new requirement for damage dealt with a medic gun.. Add the option to purchase a rail mounted accessories to guns with rails.  just an FYI its really weird that the pump action shotgun which is the cheapest shotgun has an expensive weapon lightforend grip Those things arent cheap.Edit people keep complaining that too much realism is a bad thing but realism is their goal when it comes to guns from the sounds of it,killingfloor,cj3bycd,2,t5_2rf65

If you were to grab me in real life you would probably make it harder for me to turn around or make it harder for me to aim my weapon at someone but you would definitely not make me turn around automatically to look in your face.It does indeed make clots more of a threat but also less of a threat as you simply view their head straight and just need to pop one bullet into them. As it currently is it takes away from player control and directly manipulates it. I would love it more if it would just be harder to aim and turn but that might reduce the danger of clots somewhat and of course it is also directly manipulating the player input. But it is less severe and gives the player more agency in how to deal with a situation rather than be forced to always handle grabbing in one way only.,killingfloor,cqb6lmj,14,t5_2rf65

3762856,0,t1_cqkwht1,And am I not working on it by still having to play it to reach level ? You are acting like either the game has to be a huge grind or else it has no unlocks or progress at all like theres no room for an inbetween. And by the looks of it apparently the game is for me because the reality is that leveling takes less time in KF than in KF so drop the elitism.TWI wanted to make the game more accessible and with more immediate rewarding so they did it and I am glad for it. I did still get all my perks in KF to level  but that doesnt mean it was fun always going on the front as a Commando to make sure no one stole my Stalker kills or killstealing absolutely everything and creating smoke all over the map because I needed to get my Demolitions leveled. The way KF works your leveling comes naturally from just playing the game with every perk and it comes at a fast enough rate that you feel the progress of your perk and the sense that you can move on to the next level of difficulty faster without getting too repetitive.And remind me again why you keep bringing up MMOs here when KF has hardly anything to do with them if at all.,killingfloor,cql6zgq,1,t5_2rf65

A lot of the beauty of kf was in nailing the right balance with your team in shot coordination and working like a welloiled machine. To me a team should get wiped or have to do some great improvisation if they make bad calls but should correspondingly feel like a welloiled machine if everything is working properly. A game centered around controlling the specials is just not as fun in my opinion.In my view they should release sharp as quick as possible so that they do break the current meta and start balancing appropriately in both perks and the enemies.

Yes perk bonuses from KF only apply to perk specific weapons.  This doesnt mean that they cant implement a multi perk weapon like the trench gun though.  They already track different damage types so they should be able to do stuff like having the pellet damage scale with support bonuses but have the fire damage benefit from firebug bonuses. gt when playing as either class you get that classes full perks for using it.I dont know that would make multiperk weapons outclass single perk weapons.

Only this time you have to purchase it.Its amazing but given the factors I feel TWI deliberately made syringehealing friends possible but not as viable to encourage us to purchase the medic pistol as an upgraded syringe.

3938306,0,t3_35k1ba,yes a bit. hes put in the middle of everything usually so he needs to be less squishy at the very least. a parrying buff would be nice but that might be the martial artists shtick. he needs some way to increase his total health to make those get stuff every  hp lost perks worth bothering with. there was one idea i saw suggested where the zerk would get a damage reduction buff as he gets hurt which seemed like a pretty excellent idea for the zerk TW seems to be going for. strictly speaking he isnt bad hes just not tanky which is problematic for learning to do anything against the big zeds or otherwise being the knight in shining armor so to speak when the shit hits the fan. i mean you can block any number of attacks at once that happen to come within the parry window but that doesnt do shit if you miss one and it just kills you outright.,killingfloor,cr578zo,5,t5_2rf65

As we have got more and more practice the stray damage has gone down and the utility of having stronger weapons in the hands of now higher accuracy damage doers has gone up so we have started to delay when the medic gets their assault rifle as well.

Great gunplay multiple distinctive enemy types class variety meleehealer mod support on the pro side severe lack of content no mention of lack of maps and exploitable enemy ai circlestrafing on the other hand. All I get out of this going from an uninformed viewer perspective which this is certainly targetted at unless were having a lil circlejerk here is Lots of gore great soundtrack classes do next to nothing low amount of weapons.Now the soundtrack is a purely subjective point. For example I personally toleratedislike the soundtrack and dont think it fits well. Id also argue that the point about the classes is plain out wrong. You really do notice the added shotgun penetration from support the added magazine capacity from commando aswell as the tactical reload traits. We all know Berserker sucks and the medic is pretty much the tank which noticably improves with his class!So overall this was a great experience from an entertainment perspective though you might want to see if you can slam some more information into the  seconds.,killingfloor,crx25b0,2,t5_2rf65

If even  promotional weapon is a better option then people without the game are at a disadvantage especially server hosts. Sure it helps that everybody gets it if one has it but the second noone has it you are all at a disadvantage.

I suppose a semiauto mag shotgun could also qualify as a Tier  if it boasted higher damage than the AA at the cost of semiauto only and a smaller probably  rnd mag.

For example if a player had a stumble power of  they could only stumble those zeds with a stumble resistance of less than .

5219541,0,t3_3mgf5c,I like the system but agree with you that there are pretty heavy negatives. I would say give objective XP higher values and give normal XP values lower XP. A berserker who runs past a firebug to kill crawlers when the firebug gains boosted XP from crawlers shouldnt be happening especially since crawlers are supposed to be harder for berserkers to deal with.I would thus recommend giving damage  XP kills  XP you will also get  XP for landing a fatal headshot  hate it when Id slice a clots head off in KF only for the commando to shoot the body and rob me of XP and between  current XP for objectives. However as a balance you get the current reduced medic healing XP after the player youre healing has used the trader pod that round and you get the current reduced welding XP for support while between waves.Overall this means youre still getting XP for the kills other people get and doing your objective grants a hefty XP reward. Potentially the demos kill fleshpounds XP multiplier would start at  for the assist and increase to  for an assist as they deal explosive damage to the fleshpound granting the full  if they land the killing blow.,killingfloor,cvf5ale,1,t5_2rf65

If Normal feels too easy move on to Hard. Once Hard feels to easy you can move on to Suicidal. After that Id stick with Suicidal. Hell on Earth is really only fun with a dedicated group of  to play with.

And since we think that Medics and Berserksers are more important than the rest I usually have all  by the end of the second wave.

5539748,0,t3_3qzyho,General tips start with the earlier difficulties get used to the zed types and working the headshots before you jump into harder games. Where you shoot can do more damage head glowing chest plates power backpacks less damage zed weapons legs or you can knockdown stumble or flinch the zeds. Stumbling is when a hit trips up a zed stronger zeds are more resistant to being stumbled and it will take certain weapons or skills to do it and once stumbled a zed cannot be stumbled again for a short time. Flinch is when a zeds current action is interrupted by a hit again stronger zeds are more resistant. Stick together and heal your teammates your healing syringe will recharge faster after healing a teammate than when you heal yourself. Try to find areas where the zeds are limited in the number of sides they can approach from and defend there. Melee bash can give you space and help line up shots.Zed tips sirens directly damage health ignoring armor and destroy grenades. Take them out before they get close. Fleshpounds are resistant to everything but explosives and the sword stab. Scrakes dont rage until they take a certain amount of damage and they are resistant to explosives so try not to damage them until your team is ready to dump enough damage into him to kill him fast.Dont worry about what is best play it to enjoy it. Every class has its niche play what you enjoy and what fits the team youre in.  The gun youll want it usually your T the most expensive for your class for the big zeds with a T or T gun to complement it and deal with trash. Experiment with the perks as you start playing youll start to see what will be more useful. It takes a long while to level more than enough time to learn what works for you and which perk skills are silly and useless. Your skill choices are locked each wave but can still change your skills and perks in play changes will take effect during the trader wave.,killingfloor,cwjr22q,4,t5_2rf65

I think either the frequency at which he throws them Gas Grenades specifically needs to be toned down or the Bloat Bile screen block from them needs to be reduced either in how much it covers or duration.For his melee attacks I was thinking he should lose his stupidly good tracking on his lunging combos  like right now in the middle of a combo he can literally do a fucking uturn in the middle of his attack to continue follow players which is the biggest reason I think his melee attacks are cheap.If he were to lose his tracking and had his momentum from his rocket pack continue carrying him forward it would at least in my mind allow players to actually attempt to dodge his attacks by circle strafing him and such during his biggermovement based combos while making his regular combos that he uses against Berserkers and such still effective against them.,killingfloor,cxp68c8,1,t5_2rf65

5931946,0,t3_3wltpw,Okay so basic medic tutorial. . You are the most important person on the team. Everyone else exists to keep you alive even if they dont realize it they usually dont and its usually fine that they dont know.. Your guns are never meant to fire bullets only darts. Unless yknow you get grabbed by a clot or youre doing a heroic last stand or ltenter other extenuating circumstance heregt. Most Zeds focus on the person who is attacking them. If thats not you you have to heal yourself less. Moreover if youre shooting bullets then youre not shooting darts.. At the beginning of the game dont bother buying ammo. Focus on getting your medic weapons namely all the ones that arent the SMG and keeping stocked with grenades.. Shoot three darts from your AR then switch to your Shotgun shoot  darts from your shotgun then switch back to your AR since youre level  itll already be ready to shoot three more darts. Repeat until all health bars are full.. If you see a large group of Zeds coming down on your Berzerker and none of them are a Siren throw a medic grenade at him. Itll get you assists and by extension money and itll keep him alive.. If most of your team is injured while theres still Zeds around none of which are a Siren throw a medic grenade. You want to be firing darts at the person who is most injured not the entire team.. Sirens are the worst thing and break your medic grenades. If nobody else has already killed the Siren feel free to unload your shotgun into it. Generally if you had to resort to shooting the siren your entire team was injured by her scream already so apply number .. Level  skill is for giving yourself extra health.. The level  skill was nerfed into the ground.  healing is too much of a sacrifice for  armor so use the givesyoufreearmor one instead.. Level  skill is for giving yourself regeneration..

But the fact that its only used in this community invalidates your point.  Theres no confusion no need to clarify no miscommunication.  Like it or not people dont like to type Lever Action Rifle all the time.edit the reason I asked the question again was to ask if YOU had seen it being used because I certainly have not.  And since you have not run into it outside KF either no need to mention what else it means because when LAR is mentioned in this subreddit or in KF context it means Lever Action Rifle.What youre doing is equivalent to going onto a League of Legends subreddit and saying LoL stands for Laugh Out Loud in the real world.

The reason of you taking full damage from the nd hit and all further is that st ever attack puts your melee weapon in cooldown damage mitigation still happening as intended i.e. automatically cancels the parry and then block. To the moment youll regain control of the weapon . sec cooldown you most likely will take full damage from all followed attacks.This also happening when Parry Power lt ZED Parry Resistance.Unlike parrying blocking works just fine in this case yet i cant force myself to try it instead.,killingfloor,d0ygw4b,5,t5_2rf65

7077992,0,t3_4cicpx,Your problem is likely due to what level you are currently. Before level  firebug is a relatively average zed killer. The level    perks in combination make you an AoE machine. Zed Shrapnel  level  make your weapons have a chance to cause an explosion causing a fair amount of damage. When this effect procs however a chain of explosions usually occurs that clears out a group better than a grenade. Splash Damage  level  is extremely important for bringing AoE to your Microwave Gun. Before level  your MWG can only really single target one zed. Why is this important? Well if youre trying to fend off a scrake in a tight corner but there are two sirens in front ofto the side of it trying to blow your ears out you dont want to have to worry about burning through those sirens individually before the scrake. With splash damage you can aim at whichever of those  and quickly tear apart those sirens while getting damage onto the scrake. No need to switch to another weapon no need to worry about burning up too much of your precious MWG ammo. Other than that the level  perk heat wave is crucial to kiting and dancing extremely close to entire packs of zeds. You can boldly run right towards a pack of gorefasts toss a quick burst of flames from your CaulknBurn and continue strolling right by them.Edit Also aim for the feetground ,killingfloor,d1inlhe,2,t5_2rf65

8499292,0,t1_d63rfvj,For the record when I say something is bullet spongey in this context Im mostly comparing to KF.  Assuming Im comparing to KF then basically everything thats midtier or above is tankier. The trash zeds clots crawlers maybe gorefasts are about the same but almost every single other thing takes more hits to kill even the players. Obviously this is going to vary depending depend on the perk youre playing. The headboxes are also considerably more mobile in KF making them harder to hit reliably. Technically that doesnt make them tank more damage but in practical scenarios itll make you take more shots to kill. The only exceptions to this would be when playing Sharpshooter or Demo and only specific weapons but theyre both considerably slower and less versatile to compensate for the fact that they kill comparatively tanky enemies at similar speeds making them nighuseless for anything other than those tanky enemies.  Comparing Commando starting weapons it takes  varmint vs AK headshots to decap but not kill bloats. Or if youd rather KF AK vs KF AK is  but itll cost you .k more dosh. For supports you can basically hear bloats and sirens laughing if you try to hunting them from further than  feet which is not an ideal range for bloats and sirens. The only reason husks arent laughing is because if your pellet spread is lucky you might hit their tank. ,killingfloor,d63yom6,1,t5_2rf65

8795104,0,t3_50i43e,In my opinion the main issue with the game now sits with the bosses I feel they are way way too weak if you compare them to how punishing the Patty was back then.As for Hans He sometimes beats on someone and almost kills them and then decides to just turn around and focus on somebody else making for some weird awkward looking situations. The break his shield mechanic is not an engaging mechanic it just results in one less phase to deal with His gas grenades and gas in general are not as good as they used to be on release where they would be quite the facemelting experience His machineguns are too ineffectiveAs for the Patty His minigun is almost as ineffective as Hans machineguns His One in the pipes rocket damage is way weaker His mortar attack is laughable His tentacle grab is ineffectiveThis is without even going over the general exploitation of their AI which I really hope will get fixed at least by release.How I would make Hans stronger Make him focus on the wounded teammates and on those he repeatedly wounds in X seconds forcing teammates to get his aggro by standing in the wayattacking him. Get the shield breaking out make his grab work more like a clot hell rush to a teammate and start draining them and must be interrupted by shooting at him enough not interrupting him in time will result in the caught teammates death. The teammate can shoot at him while hes grabbed which works for solo too! Buff those gas grenades a tad bit Buff either accuracy or damage on those machinegunsAs for how I would make the Patty stronger General number buff for minigun and rocket Make the mortar stronger and change how it works either make it lockon and make the missiles targetable by players lets shoot em down! or turn it in a constant barrage on the Pattys part that can be interrupted by either having players shoot at him enough or by having them run out of its range and hopefully not get blown up along the way Make the time needed for the tentacle grab to smack transition much shorter than it is now to make it harder to attempt dodging or parrying it and adding a KFlike tentacle attack would be nice too I guessAt least thats how Id do it.

Lets just go to D the challenges and lessons are pretty much the same.So lets take a character model which might be rather complexThis character model is made up of a shape thats bounded by  linesSo for accurate hit detection with an incoming projectile we need to check whether the projectile crossed any of those  linesOr for making sure that our model doesnt pass through the worlds geometry e.g. falling through the floor we need to make sure that none of those lines pass through any lines of the world geometryThis basically means that every frame of the game that is calculated and drawn we have to perform numerous checks all against the same  lines here.Assume further that those checks are quite expensive when done many times they arent on todays computers but there once was a time when they were.Especially for not falling through the floor it seems rather beneficial to reduce the complexity such as representing the player model for that specific calculation by merely a single pointAs long as that point stays above the ground the player model wont sink into the ground. Thats much faster to check than intersection with  lines. However simplifying that much has another problem Our world may have walls too and we dont want to pass halfway through themSo usually we dont simplify so much as to reduce everything to a single point but a box solves that problem fairly nicely Only  lines to check instead of   thats a  reduction in workloadThis sounds like a reasonable approximation for interaction colliding with world geometry to make sure that the player cannot go through walls or fall through the floor.However for hit detection this may be too coarse. E.g. there are a few trajectories that clearly hit nothing but when checked only against the box weve wrapped around the model they would count as a hitLets say for the sake of argument that those trajectories impact the game enough that we want to fix them but still at a lower cost than checking all  lines. We could build a simplified player model that is quicker to check and still work well enoughVoil only eight lines to check and much better results. Since we know that projectiles always come from the outside we dont need to bother aboutmodelling certain voids for thsoe purposes e.g. between the antennae at the top since we know that every shot that could enter there would alsopass through something else of the model along its way.As stated in the beginning in D this is kinda a pointless optimization. Most of the time you could do perpixel collision checks these days at  frames per second with hundreds of different shapes and the CPU wont really care.However for D we will do a major change Lines become polygons usually triangles in space the basic building blocks of models in D games. There are usually thousands of those these days and calculating the intersection of triangles with each other or a line with a triangle is a bit more complicated than just two lines in D.Then there is one aspect we havent yet talked about Ragdoll physics where lifeless corpses may still get thrown around by an explosion and should look believable.If we only used a box cyclinder or sphere for representing them a flying Gorefast corpse would pretty much act like a barrel getting thrown around which wouldnt look very believable. So in Killing Floor  there are three different ways of colliding with a character model Ensuring that the model wont fall through floors or walk through walls   This is done with a single cyclinder which encompasses the model Ensuring that a dead zed will flop around believably   This is done with a number of smaller shapes aligned along major parts of the model. Thats what you see in the screenshot. It just ensures that the Gorefasts blade can collide with the world independently from e.g. its left leg. Ensuring that player weapons hit where they aim and shoot   This is done the hard way by actually checking the projectiles trajectory against each and every triangle the model is composed of. This is slower than other methods but very precise obviously since it will always align exactly with what we see.There are other games that take different shortcuts and optimisations of course. For example the rather rough ragdoll model might be used for hit detection with projectiles. In those games you could shoot slightly next to an enemy and still hit them or you shoot a part of the character model that is outside the hit registration model and hit nothing leaving you puzzled by that clear headshot didnt hit.In most cases such tradeoffs are a question of how often each scenario is bound to happen and how much precision is needed to make it look believable.No game actually performs physicallaccurate calculations all the time.Bullets often travel in a straight line instead of a parabola they hit instantly instead of actually travellingthey also might just cease to exist after a certain distance to avoid checking for further collisions.Lighting is approximated. Ragdoll physics wont care about fingers or toes. Characters wont have  individual hairs that are animated with simulated wind and interactions between them.I hope things are a tiny bit clearer now. If not Im just going to give up for now P,killingfloor,d7gs9sc,7,t5_2rf65

Unless they add a prestige system the xp reward only benefits those that havent lvled up their perks which as we know is no requirement to enjoy the game.

As soon as you hit that parry button you will almost certainly parry several of the zeds attacks at once. And you only need to do that once every.... th second or so? Just enough to constantly keep the buff up. It is actually not that hard to do. Rest of the time you go to town with your buffed Katana The hard part when playing with Parry Skill is to avoid getting hit by bloat bile since without the Resistance Skill it will blind you so much that you will risk getting trapped and killed. Also if you hold a choke point which is often the reason why you bring a berserker in a coordinated HoE game to begin with and where you maybe even have ranged teammates shooting at the same Zeds that you are blocking you will often find yourself in a situation where you dont have Zeds to parry many of them are killed before they reach you and once they reach you someone else might hold their aggro so they just stand there in front of you not taking a swing at you. And when holding a choke point you will always get hit by bloat bile. Without Resistance Skill you will get so blind that timing your parry attempts will become quite hard. As I said earlier I dont recommend using Parry skill at all for this scenario  Personally I think Parry Skill have most potential when you solo.gt Its generally better during a wave if you have a competent team read has a medic who prioritizes team survival over kills to hold a choke point or tank HVTs for squishy classes and Dreadnaught paired with Resistance is superior for that purpose no other class can take three medium attacks reliably read without requiring parry and walk away.Agreed.The WallSkillsLeft  Dreadnought Left  VampireLeft  ResistanceLeft  SmashLeft  Berserker Rage,killingfloor,d9t8gzf,2,t5_2rf65

If he rushed your team mate and almost killed him the worst thing you can do is to continue shooting at the FP this is the  mistake new players make. You will just make the FP angry again and eventually he will slaughter your team mates one by one. Same if a FP rush you.

There are other perks that are better suited at dealing direct damage if this fit your play style better two great beginner perks for this would be Support Specialist amp SWAT...gt it feels weakI am personally very confident that I will not even get hurt when running intothrough a huge swarm of zeds. Even if there are multiple large zeds in the swarm. Even if i do it on  player Hell on Earth. And even if I only use the tier  starting weapon...! Only perk that get remotely close to that kind of confidence is a high level Berserker.This hardly feels weak to me but note that Heat Wave which is what enable me to do this is a skill you dont unlock until level .gt and I really have to spam for  sec to kill a single zed.For playing flame weapons with a Firebug. Try to just tap left mouse to set zed on fire and then walk away or if you have the perk tap left mouse to set ground on fire in front of the zed. You get full XP even if someone else steal the kill so dont worry so much about competing. If played right Firebug level up faster than any other perk and due to all its CC at higher levels it is also one of the safer perks to play. As for microwave. This weapon is strong against all medium zeds bloat siren husk deal good damage against both large zeds scrake amp FP and also one of the few weapons that deal extra damage to both bosses Patriarch amp Hans  but it deal low damage to trash zeds but Fire is really good against all trash... except maybe gorefast.My standard loadout when I play Firebug is Caulk N Burn and later Caulk N Burn  Microwave but you can also use Trench Gun  Flamethrower if you want a more direct approach.,killingfloor,dakhsak,3,t5_2rf65

They spawn behind all the cars in the grass and from the cliffs up top. I got swarmed pretty quickly waiting at the spawnnear the car and in general there are spawns set to be close to you around the map.  The car is meant as a shortcut if you are in that area not as something that will just take you to the trader everytime.It is not meant to be a easy stay in one spot and not think about where the trader is map like Cliffside and Icebound. You are meant to move like you had to in KF Farm. If you dont move towards the trader you will be shit out of luck lolI have no doubt that spawns will need adjusting I was running into weird issues with playtesting myself before release but it was very hit and miss.

10090731,0,t3_5k84y5,The flame weapons I believe are best used by first putting some ground fire on inbetween you and the zed and then shooting the zed directly until the ground fire dissipates. Its kind of a back and forth between firing at ground and firing at zeds.Ground fire deals damage independently of the fire blasting from your weapon so its best to have both going at once.Im not certain on how it is with the Microwave currently. The video you found is from a year ago which is severely outdated  this weapon has gone through a number of changes since then.If youre not playing the beta you dont want to be using the Microwave gun at all.If you are playing the beta.. Im not fully caught up on the changes but the biggest change is that Microwave now spits out ground fire which if I were to guess means it follows the same rules  spit out some ground fire then just blast the zed.On both beta and non beta the splash damage of the Microwave gun has already been nerfed severely to the point where it is no longer better to shoot ground next to zeds rather than zeds themselves. Im unsure whether its better to tap or hold fire though. Id appreciate if some Firebug player out there could share their experiences.,killingfloor,dbmu7hf,2,t5_2rf65

I have played a fair bit since EA  hours in total and I have received a total of  skin that I actually like Woodland AA Mint the other skin that I would have liked is AA Snakeskin but that came battlescarred and looks like ass as a result. Crate and Key is a rubbish system. Chances of getting the item you want are fairly slim whether you are relying on drops or actually opening crates. The marketplace is not a solution since it is affected by artificial rarity.The system PD has now is far far better than this. The crates are opened for free and are actually worth more than  cents unlike the KF crates. You actually have a realistic chance of obtaining the skins you want without spending a cent. My most expensive skin in KF is  cents almost all the others are worth less  cents.As it stands I currently have all PD skins  in total that I want bar  and it cost me less than  to obtain them. As of now I am in making money back mode where I just sell the crates that drop for me. Compare this to KF I have only one skin that I want I have spent  on any cosmetic and I have sold  worth of anything.

10414776,0,t1_dco49dm,lol no he probably thinks it sucks because he doesnt have his ADS sensitivity set properly in proportion to his hipfire sensitivity. Theres a ratio for it because it magnifies the visual field slightly Reduces field of view that mandates that for the purpose keeping consistent muscle memory between the two the scopedsighted sensitivity be lowered a bit in proportion.This game has two aiming styles for dual pistols. You can do the classic one which points both guns towards the center angled slightly so their firing points coincide. Or you can switch to one where the character holds it like they would a single pistol just with one hand with the other one off to the side.Its kinda dumb because they dont swap to the offhand one to shoot it they just shoot it from that side position.. but whatever. Point is you have access to singlepistol ADS style. I find the classic style is best for closemid range and I use the singlepistol style almost exclusively for longer range shots. The classic style is great for fast shooting because it doesnt obstruct the center of your view like the singlepistol style does. Note however they function within the game identically the differences are entirely visual.Hope thats not just a bunch of crap you already knew but yeah. Imo the correct way to play them is more free form. You need to be able to shoot accurately akimbo but you also need to be able to switch to ADS as appropriate. ADS is usually something done simply when theres time and theyre a certain distance away. Its like a quickdecision thing just have to weigh the risk of missing with no visual targeting akimbo against standing still for a moment ADS. But if youre really good at akimbo aiming you can ADS less and less.,killingfloor,dcokzo9,2,t5_2rf65

11801207,0,t1_dgx5iq7,I dont think Scrakes were meant to be supersoldiers. They were supposed to be field medics that could operate on their patients while out there in the battlefield so they were designed to take an absolutely ridiculous amount of punishment. The fuckup was they started to enjoy pain and dishing out pain. But yeah it didnt make sense that such a scrawny enemy could be as durable as he was in KF. Making the Scrake more muscular in KF conveys the image of a bullet sponge better even if he was less tanky than his KF counterpart.,killingfloor,dgxphlt,2,t5_2rf65
