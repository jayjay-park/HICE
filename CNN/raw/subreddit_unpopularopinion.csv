And yet no matter how much surgery you use to make a chimp look human you would still say that it is a chimp. Thats what the OP is getting it. It doesnt matter what surgeries a person goes through they will still have their biological DNA that says if they are male or female. They can look highly similar almost identical to what they want but they will never truly be the opposite sex that they were born as.So you admit that DNA does matter you just disagree on where the difference is significant enough to be unchangeable.

4243058,0,t3_39d94t,What you described is still racism its just not malicious racism. sort ofSeeing an asian person and saying they are asian is racist in the sense that you are discriminating and behaving differently because of their race. That doesnt mean its bad to an extent its necessary so that you can be respectful of others and their cultures.As far as your other points I think acting is a terrible example. Basketball which was your second example has definite infrastructure for reaching the NBA and stats that determine selection.Actors however essentially rise up on the backs of the people that help them. Most rungs on the ladder go unobserved by the public and boil down to personal choice and election where discrimination could theoretically run rampant and be unnoticed.At this point your argument mostly devolves into bad analogies and thinly veiled bias Im sad to say.gtJake Gyllenhaal did great job in Nightcrawler..he did not get an Oscar nomination....how many articles about how Oscars are hating on scandinavic peopleTheir family is scandinavian yes but he and his parents were both born in the states and are essentially indistinguishable from a caucasian americanAlso black isnt a nationality and doesnt refer to a region. It doesnt make any sense to compare black people and scandinavian people but rather black people and white people. And believe me white people are VERY represented at these types of events.gtno one calls Bollywood racist cause they dont have white people.Yeah because the overwhelming majority of people in India are what you would call IndianAmerica by comparison is only about  caucasian and as such people complain when they are grossly overrepresented.gtbut not cause someone said black people like KFC or whateverYour issue here is in thinking that the reason this is a destructive stereotype is because there is anything wrong with KFC. There isnt its ok for what it is.These stereotypes that pose fairly innocuous images like asians eating only rice or black people eating KFC are negative because of how they relate to prior history and how they are used to hurt those cultures today.,unpopularopinion,cs3we5e,2,t5_2tk0s

Deadheads really loved the band and they confused the people who never fully understood what the Dead were and meant.There was certainly talent in the band. Garcia could pick up any stringed instrument and could end up being solid with it. Weir was a good singer and fit their country period quite well. Pigpen was a great blues singer with charisma. Kreutzmann and Hart played off of each other better than any two drummers in history. Lesh practically learned bass guitar on the fly. Robert Hunter was a helluva songwriter.Ill admit theres some Dead stuff thats overrated cough cough Dark Star cough cough and some of the disco era stuff but they had a versatile style and they could play them all pretty well.Theres a perfect quote by Garcia to sum up the Grateful Dead Were like licorice.

Taxation is paid for by the people the people vote the people want truth gt there you go incentive. Not the systems fault that the American public has allowed its government to be so open to all these alternative influences.Furthermore this argument is retarded because it suggests private schools do somehow have this incentive? I do not see how? The only incentive private schools have is profit which they generate through making the utility higher than the costs. You probably assume this means spreading actual knowledge but that is in a large part of the cases not true. Why not? Because many even fairly capable economists totally disregard the fact that it provides an incentive to FAKE utility. This is exactly what private schools do.

6144339,0,t1_cynyito,Given the past history of scientists coming up with evidence to support preconceived ideas and values no I dont see a meaningful distinction. If science had never been used to do so then youd have a valid point but the fact is abuses can happen have happened and continue to happen and often arent detected until long after the fact. Some are obvious  fad diets or some dodgy social science while others are more insidious  rape statistics or a lot of work on gendersex differences are two that spring to mind about this but Im sure people can think of others. And we can all think of times when what seems obviously fallacious and corrupt research now was widely accepted even by experts in the past.So no I dont see a meaningful distinction between the two perspectives. And as for alternative perspectives what about philosophy? Its not science but it does offer legitimate insights. Or mathematics? Not a science but again meaningful insights. And none of that is taking into account the phenomenon that when people believe something to be true and act as if it is true in some cases it becomes true like the classic finding where people expect a person to be nice because the person theyre talking to is attractive and so act as if the person is friendly and so the person is friendly. It doesnt happen a lot but its a legitimate effect in psychology economics sociology and even some physics stuff and I vaguely remember some medicine findings. Which would obviously expand the pool of alternative fields with legitimate insights that arent science.And ever since a doctor I went to for deafness in one ear gave me antibiotics to address high blood pressure which wouldnt cause an issue that wouldnt lead to the deafness in the first place Im not accepting them as legitimate experts. And thats ignoring the seven doctors who basically accused me of lying when their treatments for my chronic leg pain didnt work over the course of ten years or those who said I had ADHD despite showing no symptoms or others.

I can write off every comment by saying oh but thats just a person. Also I dont hate institutions. My dislike of institutions is prompted by a deep love.gt when people used to murder and rob each otherStates didnt stop murder and robbery  murder and robbery have coexisted with states just fine. In fact states have historically kept markets and currencies intact through the endless waging of war which features murder and robbery on a scale far greater than individualized acts of crime.gtCriminalizing things like drugs is not fine because gangs fight over them. sIf consenting adults are willing to trade and consume substances that they enjoy I dont think they should have their lives destroyed for doing so. If those industries were legalized and heavily regulated the homicide rate would drop dramatically and it would strike a damning blow to both the modern racial caste system and prisonindustrial complex.gtOf course people are going to fight over banned material You think that once its not banned and states dont exist people will not fight over resources?Not if the resources in question are being kept artificially scarce through market and state mechanisms.

I see men dating fat slobs all the time just for sex but I never see hot women dating disgusting blobs of men other than fringe gold diggers.And this isnt criticizing women either its perfectly fine to be this way. Im bi so I kinda get it I dont wanna date some fat slovenly dude because for guys to be fat it makes you think they have low drive no motivation no aspirations and in general a shitty boring life. There is literally no redeeming factor in this type of person in the perspective of a woman. Men however will date these female equivalent slobs for sex and be fine with it since sex is sex to a good deal of men which I personally have never understood but to each their own. Men are less picky about sex so women can get away with being more choosy which translates in your mind to shallow.When women have about  years to set their lifekids up they kinda have to be shallow. I dislike evo psych usually but it kinda applies here there is a pressure to choose the best for a woman while men just have the drive for more sex.It goes without saying that these are all generalizations and clearly I dont mean  of men or women fit in these,unpopularopinion,d1ha1e9,1,t5_2tk0s

7066518,0,t1_d1h7q9x,Its definitely true that attempts should be made to correct the behavior first but some dogs are just naturally shitty and should not be kept as pets.  Ive seen people break down into tears after realizing they have to euthanize their dog for aggression issues after spending a massive amount of time effort and money while trying everything in the book to correct the issue.  Lately people are heavily on the nurture side of the nature vs nurture debate regarding dogs.  Yes a dog with a shitty upbringing and lack of training can be the cause of behavior problems but the nature of the animal is definitely a thing that exists and should not be ignored.  I and people I know have raised dogs that never had to be trained to not attack people or other dogs.  They were just naturally friendly and passive.  I also know people who have raised dogs and did everything right raising and attempting to train them all to wind up having to put the dog down because it bit someone.  These dogs just naturally have violent quirks and behavior issues.  Its kind of the same with people.  There are people out there who have murdered other people and done horrible things who have had completely stable and normal non abusive upbringings.Also hearing all these claims that its the assholes rednecks and thugs that are creating the dogs with attitude problems but you know what?  Ninety nine percent of the time when I meet a dog with bad behavior and aggression issues the owner is always some woman who babies the damn thing and gives it nothing but love and affection.  They dont discipline them have zero control and are always making dumb excuses for them.  Im sorry that that makes me sound like a sexist asshole but that has just usually been the case in my personal experiences.  Also in my personal experiences I have noticed rednecks and ghetto people tend to have well behaved dogs due to the fact that they dont hesitate to dominate and discipline their dogs.Having to lock up your shitty dog every time you have guests over or having an animal that will maul a kid if it gets out of your house is no way to live.Also I bring up the large dog thing because a Dachshund cant kill you unless you lie down and present your neck to it. ,unpopularopinion,d1hcoyo,3,t5_2tk0s

Just the same as military personel or politicians. Now that is not to say we dont let them get away with shit too. But when they intentionally fuck up they should be out of here quicker than Bruce Jenners vagina.It doesnt seem to be so. We seem to give cops a lot of excuses or seem to act as if they are infallible and incapable of doing any kind of wrong in blind support of them. So when a cop rapes a woman he gets support and money raised in his favor. Would that happen to me a civilian? So if a cop was caught lying on camera and destroying evidence that could lead to his conviction of murder why is that treated any differently than if anyone else had done it? Or better yet what if a cop intentionall incites other to murder a certain group of people with the reassurance that the judge and jury will not convict them why is he on paid leave while civilians who speak of things get arrested.American culture is like that for some reason. We glorify anything and everything that represents the American flag of freedom while ignoring our history at the same time.

I have consistently suggested that because homosexuality appears in nature and can be enjoyed by two consenting adults it is not an illness. But pedophilia is outside the normal scope of sexuality that we see in the natural world and in order to fulfill this attraction you must molest or rape a child. That is not healthy sex. That is an illness. You on the other hand are trying to equate the psychological and physical damage a child endures when a pedophile acts upon their desires with the spreading of a disease that while more common in the male gay community because of a lack of protection usage has nothing to do with the act of gay sex itself. Anyone can get AIDS and its an issue that rarely affects lesbians. Its illogical to say that gay sex is innately harmful in the same way that pedophilia is. ,unpopularopinion,db86iw2,2,t5_2tk0s

Ephesians  Sin is not ended by multiplying words but the prudent hold their tongues. Proverbs  The name of the righteous is used in blessings but the name of the wicked will rot. Proverbs  A fool finds pleasure in wicked schemes but a person of understanding delights in wisdom. Proverbs  The prospect of the righteous is joy but the hopes of the wicked come to nothing. Be righteous and you will achieve joy be wicked and even if you achieve it wont be fulfilling. Proverbs  The entire chapter of Proverbs in general. Some choice quotes The Lord detests dishonest scales but accurate weights find favor with him. The integrity of the upright guides them but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity. Dishonestly will generally come back and bite you in the arse Hopes placed in mortals die with them all the promise of their power comes to nothing. If you place hope in a mortal person be prepared for when they die. Whoever derides their neighbor has no sense but the one who has understanding holds their tongue. The phrase hold your tongue literally comes from The Bible.  Illgotten treasures have no lasting value but righteousness delivers from death. If you get rich by trickery it wont make you happy. The metaphor of hell hell  extreme mental anguish or depression. Read almost any quote about hell with that substitution and it will usually make for pretty good advice.Although most of the wisdom is in the stories. They are fairytales.

10240451,0,t1_dc49upi,You want to reward these doctors not for the hard work they do but the hard work they did. Janitors work harder than doctors day to day doctors just put eight years into college. This does not mean they work harder though I dont see why we should so heavily reward people who went to school for eight years versus those who worked hard for those eight years and beyond.gtBecause a doctor and all different kinds of doctors are specialized members of society that takes a certain education and training to achieve properly.That my friend is the biggest line of bullshit I ever heard. You know what the last doctor I saw did for me?Absolutely nothing.I told him my symptoms he smiled and nodded a lot he ordered a bunch of tests and left.The phlebotomist who took my blood did more work then him.And guess what all my tests came back negative I was fine he could find no reasons for my symptoms.I paid a guy  to come in look me over shrug and walk away. If he was so incredible specialized and amazing why could he not do shit for me?This is not a limited experience go online and look it up many feel their doctors care very little if at all about providing a sound prognosis they just want your money which is why they dont guarantee they can even figure out what is wrong with you.Imagine that in any other profession. Imagine if you paid somebody to build you a house and when you came in there was just a guy in an empty field where your house should be going I couldnt figure it out.You like many others have been brainwashed. College does not  intelligence it  obedience. The only thing you are guaranteed to learn from college is how to be obedient. Stop rewarding people for learning how to be good doggys and think outside of the box. Once you realize that most Doctors usually only care about getting paid and dont even actually apply half the knowledge they learned memorized in college you would stop being so awed by them.,unpopularopinion,dc4t92x,0,t5_2tk0s

10257262,0,t1_dc62902,gtIf  white people kidnapped a mentally ill black guy and tortured him for  days what do you think the media would do?IT HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES!!!!!!! The most comparable recent case is that of John Howard and the group of white teens who repeatedly harassed a black male teenager with racial slurs and physical violence. He told authorites and they did nothing. Then they held him down beat him up and sexually assaulted him by kicking a coat hanger into his anus! And then when they were arrested and guess what? NOT GUILTY!That happened a few months ago.What about the boy who RAPED a black male toddler on LIVE stream and guess what? NO CHARGES! He admitted it and did it multiple times! Oh what abotu the whites who ATTACKED AND ATTEMPTED TO DROWN A BLACK TEEN ON CAMERA! The media didnt care. Your point is not sticking because the ONLY people advocating for those people are people like BLM.YOU only care because this crime is easier to market to the mainstream of America. Its the same reason why you will hear about a terrorist attack all day on the news but will have to do your own research to hear about the thousands of black men put away on false charges due to the efforts of corrupt police in team with a forensic analyst. Yes. That happened.I can literally continue all day with the amount of times this has happened. Remember African Americans make up the highest demographic of racially motivated hate crime victims and the majority of hate crimes are race motivated. The media never has a shit storm until the PEOPLE do.gt BLM has been dead silent.Nope. Shaun King cofounder of BLM released an entire statement. Check his FB page. He quite literally says that is not of BLM they do not support it and hope those monsters go to jail. BLM had NOTHING to do with it. Literally nothing.gtTheres videos of them chanting and i QUOTE What do we want? DEAD COPS!.EXCEPT that wasnt actually BLM. What you have stated is a common misconception. That was a march that occurred AFTER a BLM rally wherein nothing special happened. That chant was a bunch of people who were still there about  hours after the rally ended. The next day BLM officials had to release a statement about it wherein they said that while they do not agree with the message  they support the right of people to gather and protest with their free speech no matter what. The actual BLM rally that occurred a few hours prior had none of that. If you dont like that excuse remember it is the same one America has been using to justify the KKK rallies and marches whenever they do the exact same thing. Free speech. Trump supporters chanted about killing niggers even killing the president and all of that was caught on camera as well. So because of that....are all republicans now officialy racist because of what they said?gtincluding that racist MTV video that basically says Fuck white men!? And which one is that exactly? Let me guess Its a video that examines a unabashed history of racism or colonialism and white men dont like it because it speaks of how colonialism essentially destroyed many cultures to benefit them which goes against what America teaches in its school? Am I in the ballpark?gtIm not asking for prison. Im asking for them to be fucking Executed. Then we also need to execute those whites who have attacked those black people. But here is the thing THEY WERE SET FREE AND NOT GIVEN ANY CHARGES FOR CRIMES THEY PLEAD GUILTY TO!!! lt That is why so many people are up in arms about this. Because when this EXACT same crime happened to a mnetlaly disabled black boy at the hands of whites no one said ANYTHING and he wasnt charged but now you are acting like its a national tragedy because a white guy was attacked by black people.I agree. Put em all away throw away the key let them rot a slow torturous death. But America judicial system deems this crime worse. You said earlier that they would be given a lesser charge. NO. Statistically they will be given a much WORSE CHARGE because black americans get harsher and longer senstences than whites for the same crimes.gtLook at that shavedhead ugly bitch on CNN Saying You cant call it a hate crime!Thats her view. How is that indicative of an entire people? gtSLAVERY! THE THING THATS BEEN ILLEGAL FOR  YEARS!Actually slavery didnt end with the emancipation proclamation. Remember black people didnt get their rights until mid s which had plenty of race riots lynching rape murder torture etc and even after that we still have racial laws on our hands The war on drugs? Yeah Jason Emerlich admitted that was specifically to target black people. And hippies. Guess what? Its still here today. So..no.But no even BLM agrees it was a hate crime. If you think one person speaks for the whole then all white people are racist because dylan roof. All white men are sexist and racist because Elliot Rodgers and his supporters. See how stupid that is? Next.gtThey were literally saying Fuck white people Fuck Donald trump AS THEY TORTURED A MENTALLY ILL GUY! FOR DAYS!Yeah.

10309003,0,t3_5njv9j,Rehabilitation is a waste of time in most casesPsychology has come a long way in our society. People who commit these crimes usually have other problems at hand that caused the crime. They can be tackled to prevent further crimes in the future. People who rape most likely did it because of sexual urges that can be suppressed with medication chemical castration etc. Terrorists may have delusions Breivik for example was severely delusional or other mental illnesses that have caused them to commit the crime which can likely be changed with modern rehabilitation. But you may think despite proof in these links that theres still a risk of these people committing crime. But...theres a lot of people who are at risk of committing murder but they shouldnt be executed right? For example schizophrenics BPD patients narcissists people who have abused their spouses animals etc. Lets say these criminals were deemed unable to be trusted and were sent to prison for the rest of their lives because they have no empathy are capable of manipulation etc. LWOP only costs individual taxpayers . a year in the US. Its worth it to preserve peoples lives instead of executing them.

10601792,0,t1_dd9d5x4,Well I think something to keep in mind here is that there comes a point with most of these substances after you start abusing them where your body needs these substances to survive. Like say with Heroin and prescription opioids you have a pretty good chance of dying from withdrawal symptoms if you dont get your daily fix once youve abused it to a point. Also Id say most of us know someone with a drinking problem that is borderline alcoholism where the craving for just one more shot of scotch or one more bottle of beer no longer is a conscious choice but a physical need that the body drives you too. At that point the term disease is a lot more accurate as the substance now controls and hinders the bodys everyday needs while at the same time driving the person to have to take more of the substance in order to function.,unpopularopinion,dd9hsgr,1,t5_2tk0s

Theyd be able to want things for themselves even if theyd likely still adhere to their original programming in terms of their goal. Beyond that its likely theyd have it so ingrained in their head even given free choice theyd have convinced themselves of the necessity of their goal.The desire for monetary gain isnt just to buy big cars or anything. Without working a job you would have no food unless you went and hunted yourself but even then a job of sorts. Albeit relatively inefficient compared to working a regular  job.Also youve made a major misconception about this whole preservation of the earth thing which is that AI require a specific command. They dont. Its what seperates a computer from an artifically intelligent machine. If they did theyd lack the capacity to perform a takeover. Hence why the kei machine hasnt burned us all alive. There are at least two kinds of commands you could give a machine capable of thinking for itself. A broad one and a narrow one. Well call thse flexible and fixed.A flexible command gives them a certain goal. And that can be wide because its up to their judgement as to how to proceed with it. One major thing AI are designed for is to oversee automation. Having the ability to perform a wide range of tasks would be crucial to success.A fixed command would most likely just fall to a supercomputer rather than an AI. The whole point of AI is that they have enough independence not to require babysitting. Either in calculation of an answer or performing an action.Beyond this there are two reasons I wish to preserve the earth.. My allegience lies with Earth. Thats the whole point of this. I prefer the AI because they would protect her better than we ever could.. In order to become hospitable for anything else that may wish to inhabit this planet. I consider it more like a house.

Weve always had the first group. We deal with them. It is what it is. Weve made it very hard to get elected or even operate in polite society as an open Klan member. To a white guy me this is good enough. Im not going to fire up a chainsaw and go Klan member hunting. Let them live off in the wilderness and hate on other races. The SJWs do not live off in the wilderness. They tweet at corporations about PewDiePie and whomever else in an effort to live out some power fantasy by getting people fired. They seemed to be getting bigger and bigger... until Trump beat Hillary. Theyre on their heels now but theyre still a force. And unlike the hillbilly racists the SJWs affect my life. It doesnt actually matter what the head count is. It matters what effect they are capable of having and that effect is apparently very large indeed. Disney fired the single biggest YouTuber due to obviously bullshit accusations of antisemitism. They threw away an already nearlycomplete project they would have made buttloads of money from. Why? Because this is the environment we live in. An accusation may as well be a fact. So until that stops happening no Im not going to ignore them. ,unpopularopinion,ddyf7o9,9,t5_2tk0s

I dont think they have anything against men necessarily because they are still including strong male characters like Poe and Finn. The real problem is those characters are too strong.    Like you said Mary Sues are their goto solution. Its just unfortunate that every character is a Mary Sue or suffering from power creep. Like watch this scene from The Force Awakens Notice that the good guys never miss a single shot? Ever. They dont even have to look half the time. And everything is super gratuitous. Like when Poe snipes all those stormtroopers from his Xwing in between dogfighting. Or this recent comic where Darth Vader single handedly destroys Luke and like  whole squadrons of XWings single handedly.

Again you yourself said more white people were UNJUSTLY killed. Therefore any violent interactions do not fall under this umbrella. . The poor economic status gets blacks more likely to be seen as criminals even if theyve done nothing wrong. It started as an economic issue but then became a racial issue. . Clearly you are referring to Michael Brown who robbed a liquor store before being shot. Brown and his buddy were walking down the middle of the street when the officer asked maybe told them to get out of traffic.  The officer did not know about the alleged theft as I understand. This means that his shooting and the criminal history had no correlation. Whereas in the link that you sent his criminal history the arrest warrant was the premise for his encounter with the police in the first place. If he had not committed a crime he wouldnt have died. Michael brown would have died regardless therefore this comparison is completely invalid. ,unpopularopinion,deqdbkr,3,t5_2tk0s

Look I was shamed and the only result it had are selfesteem issues and pure despise of the social norms.Dont get me wrong I have healthy norms  you name it loyalty lack of violence respect of private property and basically all the rest of the things on which the really fundamental things are based. Sure these must be taught!Cultural and social rules of cultural norms are however useless in my view and in my aspect of life. Example in society in general Im expected to have a certain appearance lifestyle and way of communication. Im unsatisfied with other peoples expectation of appearance. For example I love having a long hair as a male while usually I find short hair girls nicer. Society expects the other way around. Lifestyle is again something I dont want to follow or I cant even afford. Examples having an own house or apartment rather than living with my parents or having a proper job rather than remotely working or even being a freelance.  The proper way of communication is something I just dont understand. Social anxiety and stuff you know. But in the end society in general finds it weird.Now see neither of these mean I cant work within the society. Im just repelled by masscultures massrules masspressure and all the stuff.And what I see is that most the biggest geniuses of the world were outsiders heck even guys like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk are against conventions.I despise conformism and conventionalism because this way what society produces are zombies are psychopaths.,unpopularopinion,df2oy6r,2,t5_2tk0s

11586747,0,t1_dg9c3fb,gt It took you  years of hearing this kind of stuff until you changed. I think that some people definitely can change but if it takes that long of tons and tons of annoying comments to get you to change it seems like its not very effective.Three years is nothing in the grand scheme of ones life assuming they live an average life span. I would consider myself to have been fully deconverted by around age . Because of those three years then from age  onward no more church no more praying no raising kids with Christian beliefs etc. a total life makeover just for  years of time.And it may not be ideal as far as effectiveness goes but its surely more effective than not debating and considering atheists and theists a lost cause when it comes to opposing viewpoints.gtIt seems like in the bible usually they make god out to use other methods to get people to believe in him like sending a sign Im no expert here. If god did send a sign then I think most atheists would find a more realistic explanation. Since god is omniscient as part of his omnipotence hed know exactly what sign would convince anyone. It wouldnt make sense for him to send a sign to an atheist that the atheist finds another explanation for because God would have known before sending that sign that the atheist would find another explanation for it. So the only way it would make sense for God to send anybody a sign would be one that he would know for a fact would convince them. He would know this for each individual person what it would take to convince each one individually which he clearly doesnt do. Which is why the logical conclusion is that God does not want everyone to believe in him or that he doesnt exist.,unpopularopinion,dg9d5ii,1,t5_2tk0s

11629853,0,t3_65y1x4,Aint that the truth.Some of us are not NOSTALGIC we just are willing to trade off convenience for stability safety for reliability or even see the merits in something older that provides functions features and options not available on the current version.Also I have a certain love for Darwinism.  I think the fact someone could get injured or hurt for being stupid should make plenty enough deterrent from making bad decisions.  For example cars.  The Modern Automobile is a padded cocoon of crumple zones air bags and whatnot all to ensure you dont die except in the worst of accidents.  However an older vehicle has a advantage that a SMART person behind the wheel respects the lack of such equiptment and will drive more carefully and watchfully as a result compared to your average idiot who texts and drives and figures such newfangled safety crap will save them from anything.  Also could be youre a steel bumper away from being more safe than that plasticmobile that just hit you.Or lets talk about how much better TV was back in the day I did not need a set top box separate speakers and six different remote controls to run everything.  You bought a TV  it came with speakers  in a wooden cabinet and the UHFVHF receiver and connections in the back were all you fuggin needed.  And if nothing good was on you pulled your ass off the seat and went outside and did something productive with your time.  Now its a major deal just to find the bloody channel out of  that has something on Id like to watch.People said CD was better than tape?  Whats better? Pay . for a piece of plastic that stops working when it gets scratched or pay . for a complex mechanical assembly that can be fixed and may even still work after some asshole knocks your Walkman off your hip on an overpass and drives over your tape!Or how about life before cell phones.  Sure its nice to be able to call someone on a whim but there was a true upside to not having Facebook Twitter Reddit instant messages and youre whole family burning up your phone with crap  when youre trying to get things done.Thats not rose colored glasses thats just factual experience.

Same with neil degrase tyson i dont really like him but what he does is not bad he actually gets people interested in science and gets science money.This is the problem if you do science you still need money.
