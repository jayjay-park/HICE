8108867,0,t3_4nvp71,I didnt want to spam rrccars or rradiocontrol with multiple posts to remind people about this sub. I just want this sub to grow organically. It would help if we were listed in the sidebar for those subreddits but I have no control over it. Ive been a bit busy so I havent had time to post my own OC but hopefully soon I will. The main reason for creating this sub was to avoid the clutter of rccars and radiocontrol. Just like rcrawling its not very active but the sub is helpful because it provides focus.,Bashers,d4ricq0,2,t5_3djju
