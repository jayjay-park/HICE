3670289,0,t3_32er9p,Personally I think Raw format .nef is better than DNG if you are saving your Lightroom edits into sidecar files .xmp. All changes are stored in these small files which are very handy and fast to backup. Also converting raw into DNG when importing photos in Lightroom and doing backups of DNG files are both time consuming something I personally hate when editing my photos!,Lightroom,cqamy59,1,t5_2sdv0
3690468,0,t1_cqbbjei,I think you make a good argument for your method. Its similar to the one I employ for slightly different reasons also that I use the DNG conversion to write the edits out the files instead of xmp.For my work Im not the photographer im the editor so I am getting raw photographs from several photographers who all shoot indifferent formats. So in my own work after I am done editing to raw and before I export tiffs to take into Photoshop I convert to dng  both to mark that I have finished editing the raw files and also to write that edit information to the file. When I am done and export the individual client job into its own catalog out of my working catalog for archiving I now have the catalog file with those job edits as well as sidecar information should something happens to the catalog or I just need to quickly move the edited raw files around.For me that works for long term archiving of client work.,Lightroom,cqcxrg2,1,t5_2sdv0

5419563,0,t1_cw3w7z0,To answer your question about Lightroom vs the CC version there is no difference. Nothing about the creative cloud solves your workflow issue.You can certainly run a separate or copy of the master catalog on a laptop and add images to that catalog but then you would have to merge them with the images on your NAS and the main catalog on your home computer.You can do the solution the other commenter offered though why people suggested you need to export the catalog when you can just copy the existing one but it sounds like you would like a slightly more automated method. You might consider a solution that allows you to sync a copy your master catalog to the laptop to use while on the road and then sync back to the home computer when you get back. Then a solution for having the home NAS grab the new images or for you to manually tell it to grab the new images from your laptop and add them into your NASs folder structure at a predefined place Perhaps a separate travel folder that stays on the same location on the NAS. That way when you get back to your home pc you can open the catalog and all the images from travel would be in the folder and you can just move them out where you want them to be.Perhaps bittorrent sync has both desktop and NAS software to handle the syncing over your lan.,Lightroom,cw4encd,1,t5_2sdv0

5765927,0,t1_cxbru9k,Ok heres how I do it. Choose an edited photo you have applied the preset to. Go to Lightrooms Develop Module. Check out the panel on the left hand side. At the top of the navigator you will find the Presets option. Lightroom comes with a set of presets for you to start with.Find the  sign. Click this.. A box will pop up directing you to checkmark all the settings you want to include in your preset. Check mark all if you are not sure what you want. You can make a new preset later if you want a variation.. Name the preset like I said earlier name it with some relevance so you know what the preset does.. Scroll down and you will find the option for User Presets. This is the category where you will find your newly created preset.. To organise it into folders  select your newly saved presets not a preset folderan individual preset. Choose Show in Explorer PC or Show in Finder MAC. The folder where the preset you clicked on is stored will open up.. Go back to Lightroom and close it down.  VERY IMPORTANT STEP. Now in the folder organise your newly saved presets however you like in which ever folder or hierarchy you prefer just label them well for easy reference . When done reopen Lightroom and you should then find your presets in your organised folder or hierarchy If you want I am happy to write a guide with pictures etc.Just PM me,Lightroom,cxbtec8,2,t5_2sdv0

6019804,0,t3_3xpp25,gtThis used to be instant Im not sure why a x increase in resolution would cause this much of a change.Any raw editor has a disadvantage over any conventional RGBCMYK editor like Photoshop in that a raw editor is not starting from rendered pixels. It is starting from raw data. It must recalculatererender the RGB pixels from raw every single time you make an edit. Those are steps Photoshop doesnt have to do. All that extra work is proportional to the number of pixels it has to render. You doubled the pixels...dont be surprised that the rendering times got longer more or less in proportion.Another related factor not often talked about is the number of pixels being updated on the screen. You may be able to speed up rendering a little by not working in full screen and shrinking the size of the Lightroom develop window so that fewer pixels need to be updated on screen. Originally this was a way to speed up Lightroom and Camera Raw on slower machines. But it is relevant again since megapixel counts have gone up so much. Also contributing to this... If you are working on a Retina display because this multiplies the amount of pixels being updated on the screen at once. I dont guarantee that shrinking the view window will always work in a noticeable way but it has helped in some cases in the past. Only a few years ago maybe we edited MP raw files on a x .MP MacBook Pro screen. Now we are editing MP raw files on a x .MP Retina MacBook Pro screen. Think about what those changes mean for the sheer amount of rawtoRGB calculation that needs to be done by Lightroom. The i processors have not advanced that much in that time.,Lightroom,cy8pyqh,1,t5_2sdv0

Instead synchronize your root folder and then properly delete the images in your Previous Import collection after checking that synchronize didnt catch other images that you intend to keep.DetailsWithin the Library modules Folder selector select your base folder Lightroom in your case rightclick and choose synchronize folder.  If your Lightroom folder is not displayed just do it on the  folder since you are sure these photos were only taken in .A dialog will pop up. Dont bother with showing the Import dialog or scanning for metadata updates.  Your only goal is to get all of those files that ARE in your Lightroom folder but ARENT in your catalog to show up in the Previous Import collection.Wait for the synchronize to finish.Ok now in the Previous Import collection review the photos to ensure you didnt pick up any unexpected keepers from previous catalog mistakes.

8466648,0,t1_d5x0ebj,I think you have a wrong perception of what LR is.Imagine a library a real one the building. Lots of rooms in there shelves on them books. In the entrace a big cabinet with drawers indexing all the books.Now Your computer is the library different harddrives and usb sticks make up for rooms. The shelves are folders the books your images.LR is the central index. Every book image is indexed here. Even if a room is locked because of painting or repair even if a harddrive is not connected the index still knows which books are where.Now for the good part Even if a room is locked the index still has basic information and a summary about it. Same with LR  Even if a harddrive is not connected and the image itself is not available LR can still work with it LR creates previews much smaller than the original files that let you continue working with the image think selection collection even retouching. Only when you really need the highdef image you need to connect your harddrive.One biggie is to never move photos with the Finder but always with LR. Otherwise the index gets garbled if someone moves a book to a different shelf or room how can the index know?So Import your external drive but make sure to Add. NOT Move. NOT Copy. You can set the size of the preview in the preferences. All your images are visible all the time but dont take the space on your harddrive.LR is a catalog.

8566341,0,t3_4x43ta,I use a fairly shitty relatively speaking compared to what else I have PC with an i with a GTX and Gb to do the bulk of my Lightroom editing. The local drive is a SATA SSD and the library is on a networked over GbE SSD array which isnt necessarily faster IRL than a decent but not classleading local PCIe SSD. Not adjusted the settings from default bar changing cache to Gb. Ive never felt it was that heavyweight a program  and Im on LRCC. Exposure changes on D RAWs for example arent a problem and all general operations dont really require waiting around for the images I work with far more frequently  MP DNGs.I imagine the problem could be that you dont have a good computer regardless of the Gb of RAM or maybe its fucked in some way and you dont realise it. Or maybe that plus you use a Mac  Ive definitely noticed LR to be slower on Macs e.g. my iiU Surfaces can outpace the WCPU Macbook Pros by generally small but sometimes quite noticeable margins especially on io tasks  which is surprising given the Surfaces are definitely weaker on spec for both storage and CPU in most operations. ,Lightroom,d6cdeip,1,t5_2sdv0
8587229,0,t3_4xfbvy,gtThe problem is when we change catalogs all of our settings presets etc get removed and we have to start over.   I understand why presets would not be available and its due to them being set to have the catalog manage them. I do this to and its great since Im usually in different computers and importing presets into public computers isnt always reasonable.  gtWeve just been using the defaults for everything because no matter how much I look or search I cant find out how to carry settings and presets over to a new catalog.     The settings shouldnt change much except for those specific to the catalog. The presets need to be managed by Lightroom but it sounds like you have them managed by the catalog.  gtFor example we have the catalog setting to backup each time LR exits. It works great but when I create a new catalog I have to go back and manually set that setting again.    This is done by default because not many users need it. The same reason why XMP write is off by default.  gtLikewise we changed the value on one of our brushes cant remember right now which one and when I opened a new catalog the setting hadnt saved and carried over.   No idea.   gtHow can I make sure than any changes we make any presets we create or download and any settings changes get saved from catalog to catalog?

9933422,0,t1_db29iox,I can do a better write up later tonight currently in the subway on a way to shoot someone and doing this on my phone so disregard the typos and formatting.Starting with the import you get the option to create different types of previews everything from minimal to Smart.  Minimal  Creates the thumbnail size image for the film strip preview window and grid library. I generally create this because it allows for faster imports and takes up less space on my drive.  EmbeddedSidecar  This one isnt widely used but really helpful specially for those people that want to get that straight off the camera look. But this only applies to certain RAW files that have the jpeg attached to them with the exif data. Sometimes you see it for a split second when you first enlarge a thumbnail and then Lightroom switches it up by displyaing the RAW file.    This preview is generally created in the Develop module if not done in the import settings.  Its the full pixel size rendition of images but not full quality somewhat like how you can save the jpgs at different quality but retain the size. Its also automatically created upon zooming in when you have an image open in the develop module. Nectar its gets auto generated sometimes people forget to purge the previews when they are no longer needed.   And the Smart Preview these guys were introduced later on in Lightroom and are lossy DNG copies. They retain more info but are limited to px long. They are also stored separate from the other preview.   At the end of a regular workflow you probably would have created every type of preview without noticing and that takes up space.   ,Lightroom,db2cm2q,3,t5_2sdv0

The archive library takes a while to load because the library files are completely on an external drive but after that its golden. The only time I see it bog down is when I open up this job where I shot with a DS using full MP raw files. But even that is a minor annoyance. Full disclosure. Considering building a hackintosh desktop. ,Lightroom,dc8v0w2,2,t5_2sdv0

11148323,0,t3_5z67qt,Buy a laptop if you want to waste hours waiting for your photo editing program to load build a PC if you want to upload and edit photos quickly. Youll get the best value for your dollar tons of storage the ability to upgrade. Future proof yourself. Unless you edit your photos on the go. ,Lightroom,devnfe1,-6,t5_2sdv0

11165433,0,t1_dexihjb,Ok thanks for the input. Didnt know that C applies processing and LR doesnt I thought both would apply some sort of interpretation by adding something.  Anyways dont really like the tinting LR shows when importing my Nikon pictures. Will consider buying a color checker.,Lightroom,dexl90q,1,t5_2sdv0
