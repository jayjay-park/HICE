Ask him to show you a lease where it states what you need to pay a month. They can evict you since you are technically a month to month tenant. All they need to do is give you  day notice to leave same on their side.. you can give them  day notice and be out. Honestly move... people like that arent ever going to play fair and from what you state the house is not going to pass any pre mortgage inspection when they try to sell it. I hope you have time stamped pictures or copies of communications with her about the state of the house so they cant come after you. Cut your losses and move on. ,Tenant,d0t7a54,1,t5_37hxm
9532735,0,t3_5be0fx,Thats not okay at all. The only time they are allowed to enter without notice is an emergency. I never want them coming in when Im not there. One time I was in the hospital for pneumonia and they came in to fix my garbage disposal while I wasnt there. Also walked out with my  camera. ,Tenant,d9o3yay,1,t5_37hxm
