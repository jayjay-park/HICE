2105929,0,t1_cl48e1a,Hey Dev here. My plan is to allow you to pick up rotate and replace all machines to make the game less punishing to experimentalists. This mechanic will also really come into its own when the market simulation is in because half the game will be thinking How can I reuse this Agglomerator from this no longer profitable line in a new more profitable one.If you think about it making it so that you only get half your money back will actually push players to experiment more once this is in as it it incentivises them to move stuff around rather than outright sell. DRegarding the market  Ill do a much more detailed video blog on this in due course. It wont be multiplayer per se but there will be computer AIs that play under the exact same constraints and rules as the player.

However if military units are available too quickly then it becomes simply a race to get the first unit out which may be fun i suppose.I guess the units would be autospawning...or perhaps you could place them like a clockwork toy and they trundle off in a fixed direction.The units would need to be weak and the player would be able to kill them manually to help keep early game balance. Not sure about the rush distance... perhaps if the two players were at least  screens apart to begin with and the units moved pretty slowly then it could be reasonable.Makes me think of supreme commander in a way.,factorio,cm7ez0v,1,t5_2wabp

Then I move over two screens and start building a new factory while my old one does all the starting science stuff.

Test is started by a single power pole that connects the test areas power to the main grid all at once.The tests I did all lasted several minutes and some I just let run and observed.  In every test the results showed that the range in which belt corners is rather narrow.  Any surplus or deficiency in supply will negate the corners impact.  A belt near  ratio of supply to demand is a belt that needs no corner or fixes to remove the impact.  The splitter method is slightly better than using the next speed belt on just the corner.,factorio,comvqmz,1,t5_2wabp

Run just iron and copper or add on more lines with gears and circuits. And it gets even more fun trying to make a Christmas tree design off that idea which connects efficiently going back to circuits being needed for so many things and needing tons of them. And thats before you get into oil products which throw a wrench in the gears!        After youve had a chance to play in that a bit give logistics bots a go. Youll by then have an idea of what youll need and can group up production close together and keep those bots moving effectively.

5813794,0,t1_cxgv8ai,Since my tweet ended up here I may as well give some background to my game session!I played through the demo and then downloaded the zip release ..?. I didnt bother checking for any other versions or mods and I didnt check any other tutorials or LPs.Factorio did a great job at showing what materials you needed to be able to construct things but not the other way around. So I used the internet to figure out what to do with heavy and light oils for example. I also googled when I couldnt figure out how to destroy a nest with  spawners I think two nests had been constructed next to each other...... which also led to me cheating at the game sorry!. The spawners kept spewing out monsters that would destroy my laser turrets faster than I could place them so I found out about the game.evolutionfactor variable and set it to a lower value it was at ..I was very happy that the game had an end goal. I never built any trains or robots so I know that there is a lot of more content in the game but I feel satisfied with the time spent and I will probably not play any more in a very long time. Im not interested in the new end goals. If I had wanted anything it would have been a more rewarding victory screen  In any case it was super fun while it lasted!,factorio,cxhr7c1,17,t5_2wabp

6078953,0,t1_cygd19d,gt Put in a couple of research levels on gun turret and bullet damage. They stack so your turrets will chew through biters in no time. Redgreen research for turret output is pretty cheap as things go.Also for similar reasons piercing ammunition is more useful than it at first appears.  It requires steel to produce so setting up a reasonably early smallscale steel operation is very handy.  Steel furnaces are also faster than stone furnaces so thats another win.gt  I know you said you dont have oil yet but once you do eff. modules are godsend. The worst offenders are usually miners and furnaces start there and continue to fill your assemblers later.Dont forget solar panels and accumulators.  Steam power is a tremendous pollution source.  Keeping the boilers and any coalpowered furnaces at a central and defended location will help control biter aggression by increasing the distance from the pollution sources to the biter nests.Efficiency modules can also only be applied within electric furnaces which themselves require oil red circuits.  Powering an electric furnace via coal is not a big win prior to modules because it simply shifts the pollution from the fuelburning furnace to the fuelburning boilers.,factorio,cygfn31,2,t5_2wabp

Going from left to right Lets say copper is on the blue belt and it hits the entrance to the blue underground belt. This copper will come up  tiles over at the blue exit and then immediately go back underground at the blue entrance in the next tile.In the meantime theres iron on the yellow belt and it went underground off screen to the left. The iron comes to the surface via the first yellow exit in between the blue and red entranceexits and then it goes back underground via the yellow entrance.The same thing is true for whatever the red belt is carrying.This method has allowed us to transport  full belts with different items in the space of only  belt.

6971235,0,t3_4b6p9m,Trains are shorter when vertical due to what artists call perspective.  A quick way to demonstrate the mechanics of that are to look at a books cover straight on.  Then tilt it forward.  Eventually it will start to look noticeably shorter and by the time youve lowered it to be flat with your eyes you wont be able to see the cover anymore.Thats basically whats happening with the trains.  As the perspective shifts from topdown to an angled view trains oriented along with your view will start to look shorter and shorter.It is not feasible for the developers to make the vertical and horizontal train lengths equal.  They would have to rewrite the coding such that the squares on the grid are squished into rectangles and they wont be doing that.As for why the cargo wagons and such are a weird length I have no idea.

7037894,0,t1_d1dzix2,Aye I know of the Landfill mod. This script was written for use on a server where I had access to the console but not the freedom to add mods. Regarding the need for users to modify the script I understand your point and was trying to figure out a way around this. However the issue I had on the server that I was using this on was that the world wasnt new so some of the bodies of water had power stations coming off of them. Therefore I had to modify the bounds on a case by case basis in order to not fill in the lake underneath the offshore pumps. Writing this has given me an idea about how I could extend the script to handle existing offshore pumps when filling in an area around the player. It might make the script copyandpaste at the cost of increased complexity and therefore difficulty for users to understand what it is actually doing. Ill have to give it more thought.

7147961,0,t1_d1qmmhn,To elaborate on the train signalsThe standard ones check the track is clear up until the next traffic signal you can also control which route trains will go. Say you have a siding so two trains can pass if you have a signal facing one way on the siding and a signal on the main track facing the other way. Trains from one direction will always go into the layby and trains coming from the other direction will use the main track either one will stop at the signal if the other train is coming meaning you can run multiple trains on the same track. There are also the new chain signals which check that the following two sections two signals later are clear so they check if the train can not only get through the next section of track without crashing but they also check it can exit that section of track also. Sometimes you end up with situations where two trains are blocking each other from proceeding the chain signals allow you to avoid this by holding the train back until it is sure it can get to the next siding.There are some rail tutorials here They will probably do a better job of explaining than I have. ,factorio,d1qne91,4,t5_2wabp

Advanced Oil Processing with Cracking is the best option if you only want Petrol out so how much oil does it need...     oil gives  heavy . light . petrol.   cracking takes  heavy to make  light  and  light to make  petrol    so  oil gives a total of .  .      .         Petrol   .  .  .   . Petrol.    So . Petrol can be made from  Oil amazing how these numbers are so neat.    Without the modules it would take  depleted pumpjack  seconds just under  hours. So with the modules it would take that pumpjack and hour and a half to repay the oil cost of modding it up.      Conclusion  Ignoring considerations of the other resources used and how quickly your factory could make them. Adding  Speed Module III to a Pumpjack will repay its oil cost in just under  minutes.  Worth it if youre looking at the longhaul and are not limited by other resources.     On Beacons  Given that Beacons only transfer  of the effect of their modules modules used in Beacons would repay their oil cost in  hours.

If you add enough plants doing lightgtgas the only time the refineries stop is when petroleum gas is full but at the same time you will never end up with no heavy oil for lubricant.Edit When you start producing solid fuel for rocket fuel you produce solid fuel from light oil instead of cracking it to petroleum gas.,factorio,d2j53t7,3,t5_2wabp

Water tends to create chokepoints and without modding cant be modified it is free however.Chokepoints arent very good for the player because it forces more of the enemy force into a given area while the player has a much lower limit to density a large number of bugs can occupy the same space a single turret can  this makes it far more likely that turrets will be overpowered and walls breached.

How much more efficient will your factory be?  Balancers decrease the probability that a single chokepoint will slow down your entire factory.

8102841,0,t1_d4qogfp, it would be cool to have to set up diferent defenses by water tailored to the traits of the sea dwelling monsters maybe they could make the flame thrower deal more damage to them once they are on land but none when they are in the water meaning that you can either make a wall of flame thrower turrets away from the water to kill them once they got on shore or use regular gunlaser turrets to kill them in the water but less efficiently. Even better if you give them a resistance to lasers in water making gun turrets actually useful for something late game. I think adding variety like this could greatly enhance combat and force the player to design for a variety of challenges instead of just placing more solar panelsaccumulators. At this point guns are essentially useless once you start getting bigger biters.      Now this is a game about automation not combat but seeing as a very large amount of power is sunk into laser turrets late game and that to get the last bits of research you need to engage in combat to obtain bubblegum I think that changes like this could greatly improve gameplay.,factorio,d4qtz6f,2,t5_2wabp

What this does bring to mind is the idea of making them more like customizable assemblers tho.  Imagine if inside you had subassembler level machines like a Strip Cutter and Coiler to make copper plate into copper wire? The more interesting bit would be a stamp cutter cause youd end up with something Factorio is really missing which is waste. Imagine your custom cog factory had iron scrap as output cause you just stamped the cogs out of it. Tehn ether in the same facility or outputted to another you smelt a few of those scraps down to get a plate back out of it. Maybe plastic waste was useless and went to an incinerator?  Could be extrapolated too having lower efficiency devices from iron cloils via the same sbassemblers you use for copper ones instead of those copper coils etc.  Just a thought.

The basic idea just like MadZuris train station loader. Get the total number of items going in divide by  the number of lanes going out. Then combine the items going in to a particular lane with the result of the division. If it is lt  turn the lane on.This theoretically works with any number of output lanes and you can hack any number of input lanes into the system.,factorio,d5mzzi0,1,t5_2wabp

You wont see big biters for a long LONG time unless you go out and kill nests activelyA single turret can get overwhelmed if theres a rather large wave so  turrets paired up at each point of defense is plenty to get you to the point where you are making laser turrets.

8607748,0,t3_4xo2bl,Heres how I imaging this fitting into Factorio without becoming too laborious to produce and without adding a ton of extra specialized buildings. Mine uranium ore using any type of mining setup. This produces ore at the same rate as any other process.. Use a chemical plant to combine uranium ore sulfuric acid and water to produce yellowcake uranium. A large amount of ore is needed to produce a unit of yellowcake maybe . Yellowcake produces pollution from wherever it is stored including from a container.. Yellowcake is placed in a chemical plant to produce fuel rods. This doesnt require any other components but it takes a relatively long time. Fuel rods cannot be placed in the inventory they must be handled entirely by machinery.. Fuel rods are placed in a reactor. The reactor acts like a furnace but while its processing it generates power. The end result of burning the fuel rods is depleted fuel rods.. Depleted rods can be used to create advanced ammunition or they can be reenriched in a chemical plant which takes and long time and has a high ratio. Depleted rods produce pollution from wherever they are stored including from a container so theyll need to be handled carefully.So the end result is one extra new building the reactor two new transitional components uranium ore and yellowcake uranium one new fuel source fuel rods and a final component that can be used in other crafting depleted fuel rods.,factorio,d6hkb5g,2,t5_2wabp
8611119,0,t3_4xo2bl,Great videos. I like your thoughts on how this could be implemented. As far as the complexity goes I was thinking a more simple flow could work better by shifting the complicated part from the number of steps to just more complicated recipes.Ive still got this process pretty complicated but I view this as a lategame power source meant to produce power for megabases.Im using pseudochemistry to try and make it reasonable for Factorio so these reactions make a lot of assumptionsskip steps.Here are the steps Ive come up with. Mine Uranium Ore could be named Uraninite or Pitchblende from the ground.    . This could be mined in the way you described under other ores like from oil patches etc.    . Or it could be obtained by processing stone ore in a chemical plant with water washing away the unwanted elements and stuff to find Uranium Ore. If we went with this route then we could shortcircuit step  and produce Uranium Slurry here. Im thinking if we are going to use stone then it should be a pretty expensive recipe like  stone ore to  unit of Uranium Slurry etc.. Wash the ore to create the Uranium Slurry.    . This would be done in a chemical plant by taking Water  Uranium Ore to produce Uranium Slurry. The slurry could be piped or put into barrels for storage.. The Uranium Slurry would then be processed in an Advanced Chemical Plant This could be based off of a refinery model with  inputs etc. This reaction would take Sulfuric Acid  Uranium Slurry  Ammonia and output Yellowcake a.k.a Uranium Oxide.    . Uranium Oxide should come out as a solid to be transported by belts. Perhaps the reaction would require iron plates so it would be put into shipping containers or something.    . A way to create Ammonia would be to use large amounts of electricity in a chemical plant with Petroleum Gas  Water to replicate the HaberBosch Process This process should require an Advanced Chemical Plant as well since the power requirements should be much higher than the standard Chemical Plant.. Mining Calcium Fluoride Fluorite which could come in small patches of purple or green orecrystals could provide the necessary sources of Fluorine and Calcium for the remainder of the process. Or maybe it could be made from Alien Artifacts? I am drowning in these late game    . Perhaps Fluorite could be refined from more stone by putting it through a chemical plant  sulfuric acid or something.    . Processing the Fluorite in an Advanced Chemical Plant  Sulfuric Acid  Water could result in Fluorine Gas and Gypsum a powder.         . Alternate use for Gypsum could be for making Reinforced Walls by combining it with concrete or something.. The Uranium Oxide would then be combined with Fluorine Gas to create Uranium Hexafluoride. . The Uranium Hexafluoride would be piped into a series of Centrifuges new building.    . The mechanic for purification could follow the same flow as boilers do with watersteam. The more centrifuges there are in series the more purified the Uranium Hexafluoride gets. The centrifuge stage should take a long time so that parallelization is encouraged.. Once the Uranium Hexafluoride gas is sufficiently purified it will be combined with the Gypsum to create Uranium Pellets.. Uranium Pellets  Steel or maybe some spaceage light density structure or something to create Fuel Assemblies.. The Fuel Assemblies  Water will be used by a Reactor building to produce Pressurised Contaminated Water With a high temperature  and Depleted Uranium.    . Weapons and stuff can be made from the Depleted Uranium.. A Heat Exchanger could take normal water and Pressurised Contaminated Water to create Steam A new fluid with a high temperature.    . This way the player can decide to pipe contaminated water into a Turbine to create tons of pollution or use a Heat Exchanger to reduce pollution to almost nothing.    . A Heat Exchanger building should be an expensive recipe or researched separately.. A Turbine can accept Hot Water Pressurised Contaminated Water or Steam to produce electricity. Hot Water will only produce marginally more energy than a steam engine would.Ill have to continue my thoughts tomorrow as I have spent way too much time on this tonight. Let me know what you think of this process so far.Im considering trying to test out this flow in my spare time. Ive never written a mod for any games but Im familiar with writing code so how hard could it be D,factorio,d6hziyk,3,t5_2wabp

The new system checks how many objects you have in a chunk each one slightly lowering the probability that biters will decide to expand there. You cant get it down to zero but a single line of walls slows the biters down quite a bit.This is obviously not at all affordable out in the open but when you can find a nice choke point between bodies of water its worthwhile block it off. After several hours an expansion party will come tear through the walls though.I have a little design I use to supplement the wall though. Its sort of a pillbox bunker. Wooden chest couple of burner inserters pointing out in all directions then a turret for each inserter. I drop a stack of anything wood in the box so the inserters can power themselves and  ammo depending on how far into the game I am and finally put up a wall around it all. The thing is the expansion parties of biters are a predictable size so you dont need crazy levels of fortification.

8871018,0,t3_51qely,I see a lot of comments especially from OP about comparing your play through to someone else and if you use mods then you cant compare your  rocket per min to anyone else without mods. My question is why would you. Obviously its not the same achievement so why even consider it. Besides why not let everyone play the game they want to play and not shame the ones that use these mods you consider cheats. It doesnt effect your game if i play with warehouses or nested factories. So what does it matter to you. If that is how I want to play then just leave me be. So many people want to stand on some moral soapbox and say you are cheating if you dont play vanilla. If you dont like cheaty mods then dont use them. But if you do dont feel shame from those that would look down on you from their high vanilla horse. The modding api was added for a reason so that we all could build a game that we enjoy on top of the foundation that is vanilla. As a side note i normally dont use many mods. Bobs rail tanker FARL and another i cant think of that lets you see where all your trains are.

AM Electric Drills Repair Packs Pipes Lights and so on.  But since the quantity needed is low its still very efficient.gtEtc. etc. Youll find that you use fewer belts and your resources are more efficiently being used... instead of tons and tons of items sitting idle on a belt.As opposed to tons and tons of items sitting in logistics chests? PI really dont see items on belts as a problem.  Space is infinite.  I make my stuff compact but not excessively so.gtWhy not just plan correctly from the start and build the engine assembly machine next to the electric engine machine? Careful planning gt main bus.You are assuming that I dont carefully plan from the start.  I think youre being a little rude.  I DO build the engine assembly right near the electric engines.  My point is that I route the lesser used items on the side rather than on the main bus.  Stone for example I bring in on the side for rails and concrete.gtBut once the throughput starts to hit  iron per second having lanes of irononly blue belts going everywhere becomes ridiculously unwieldy. The only solution there is to start using bots.False.  There are more solutions than bots.  Subdivision also works.  Spreading out the workload and bringing materials and products where you need them via train.Heres a picture of my July Community Map factory so you can see what kind of organization I do.Logistic robots are certainly a powerful tool but to say they are required is doing belts a disservice.

For singleplayer it would work out great thought.  The hard part about implementing it thought is that it really cant be a lot about building stuff If its implemented the same as MCMMO talking more about that lower down. S   Being a group of friends and only allowing the person with the highest skill of that type to build since it would be ineffective to allow someone else could turn out to kill the mod. MCMMOs skills is all about personal digging and slashing. Theres no placing block stats. That mostly fixed any competetiveness in whos digging what for the highest chance of successexcept for early level diamonds whoever had highest mining was the one to take the diamonds for the double drop. As you can have a single person placing everything out for maxed effectiveness it could turn out to be boring for the people that doesnt earn experiencedoesnt get any bonus.  One way could be to make the experience gain to be globally shared between all players of the map so that everyone works togheter for a shared goal! That way everyone would be allowed to do stuff because everyone has the same efficency. Scale the experience needed with the amount of currently playing players.

Youre right its all about automation.In my current factory which I am planning to be fully train and circuit network powered with no main bus or k bots I installed some peace mod. I just want to concentrate on the rail network and not attacking aliens. The mod removed all biters spawners and most of the military tech to even research. In its place is alien ore which you have to mine smelt then run through a chemical plant to produce the relics. This lets me automate the relics and as a bonus I dont have to hear the endless alerts when aliens attack my walls. Win!I know this is technically cheating but thats ok with me.

But once you get how signals work and you can benefit from the much higher throughput and ease of setting up the game suddenly gets a lot more fun again and you can make much bigger bases with less tedious work.Id compare trains to mods in general in terms of how much more enjoyable they make the game.

So you end up having to use lots of double negatives throughout your network.  Its not as bad as it sounds since one arithmetic combinator can do it via wildcarding.Another trick is that if supply exactly matches demand eg  demand and  supply the signal for that item will disappear from the network.

9430363,0,t3_59ua8x,I recently did the no spoon achievement and it took my  hours on my first try. My mentality was simply to get to blue science ASAP and then start working toward rocket parts while researching the rocket. Use any downtimes to increase production.. there is always something to improve.I got the no solar energy and no logistic chest achievement in the same game these things will just slow you down. No need for electric furnaces trains modules as well.Ill admit it was quite stressful reminded me of my starcraft multiplayer times. The time budget is not that tight tho as I had an hour left. I could have saved time with a slightly higher enemy density took quite some time to find biter bases without a car and by actually having a better plan realized i need solar panels for the sattelite a bit to late and so on. Having a plan mapped out in general is what will improve your time most the world record is sub  hour  hours although that shouldnt be possible without a perfect map seed. I just rerolled until i had iron copper and coal close by to speed up the start as well as coal and water in close proximity for steam engines.EDIT Base layout after launching. The spawn point was in the north you can still see my abandoned furnaces and im standing next to the rocket silo. I used a basic main bus to avoid spaghetti but it was done pretty much on the fly nevertheless.EDIT Forgot to mention always keep something in the crafting cue! That multitasking is one of the most challenging things... However I think I would automate gear wheels into a chest early on if i would do another run.

9442134,0,t3_5a13ye,Its not so much the roundabouts themselves but the fact that in systems with these roundabouts trains can often not leave their station in the correct direction and have to use a roundabout to turn around. This can lead to jams between two roundabouts where two trains are in the roundabouts trying to go to the other roundabout with lots of trains in between them wanting to go in different or the same directions as the trains in the roundabouts. Youre essencially creating a loop of track where only a certain amount of trains can enter. If it reaches that number the entire loop gets jammed.So as long as trains dont try to turn around in the roundabouts but just take another exit youre mostly ok.NO SIDING STATIONS unless you make sure the train can exit in the direction it wants to go.,factorio,d9cuvmv,0,t5_2wabp

However I compensate for this since I need less ironcopper down the line and can keep by bus the same size.IMO his production bus only works for end game .  While moving up you need lots of red circuits for other things not a ton but alot.   So if just making a X rockets per minute base then yes...the way he shows the production bus is PERFECT.   If you dont like bots..yep problems there too.   for me my production bus starts with  lanes of copper and iron each then followed by steelgreen circuit branches.  I put these on my production bus but my  lanes each of ironcopper are now down to at most  each thus  leaving  lanes open for steelgreen circuits.   A little further later ill make red circuits and put that on the line.  But that is where I usually stop ironcopper plates green circuits red circuits steel.Simply put my bus NEVER gets wider but just changes form.,factorio,d9pyss7,1,t5_2wabp

Cargo ships and designating how they move ports trade routes etc could function equivalently to trains on a rail network only it can all only be built on water. Ports are just your water stations potentially even with a mod that makes a dock using wood and would be functionally equivalent to simply using landfill and then putting concrete on it. This would allow you to build your inserterseetc around your cargo boat water train. Deep water oil rigs would just be from their modded base again only being able to be built on water and of course someone could add a resource that is Oil Underwater that only spawns on water. Undersea mining same deal but perhaps have it spit out random ores or something rather just generating a new type of resource that visibly looks odd in water.

First of all your definition has a contradictiongtIf it cant do that put it on an output..it puts in the next logical location based upon the splitter state.vsgtIf you backup any one output the paradigm is not longer true and thus it wont balancing as you think it should.If its NOT backed up then there is nothing to prevent the splitter to put it there so for it to act the way you describe it it has to be backupresilient.Second even your image shows that my setup is perfectly fine for what I want and I dont want true balacing whatever it is I want full throughput unless the whole output is backed up. Right now it doesnt happen for some reason the  full  some litter input belts get stuttery even though the outputs are not all backed up.Your picture shows it perfectly if the top is backed up it reroutes.

The basic idea of signalling is that whenever a train enters a crossing it should always always be able to continue uninterrupted until it has exited that crossing entirely. In this case when a train enters the crossing with the intention of going north it will stop before the intersection above if something is in it and itll still be partly in the way crossing.The solutions to this are to either change the north exit signal to a chain signal so that itll never stop there or to move the intersections further apart so that all your trains can sit in that spot and not block the intersection.,factorio,dcwqee6,2,t5_2wabp

Furthermore in my current map I tried to divide the railways into  sections   for deliveries and  for personal use. The delivery one has no need for circles since I make sure there is always a best in most cases only route for the train to take while the personal use has many roundabouts in case you are traveling one way but want to go the other.

This is why I dont use them.A perfect balancer on the other hand is afair distributor and has these properties Any input can reach any output Perfect distribution The system is not a bottleneck to any input Perfect throughput Any input belts content is equally balanced to each output belt Perfect fairness However they take a lot of space and are complex. Thats why I dont use them either.What I am really looking for is a good enough distributor with the right balance between distribution size and fairness.A  distributor would have the following properties  Every output belt can be reached by at least  the input belt Good enough output distribution Every input belts can reach at least  of the output lanes Good enough Input distribution The system is not a bottleneck to its input ThroughputAlso a  balancer would have the following properties  Any input can reach any output Perfect distribution The system is not a bottleneck to any input Perfect throughput No input belt when taken in separation send more than  more items to any output belt than to any other Good enough fairnessAs in many systems I believe theres a way to get  of the job done for  of the cost.,factorio,dd9u8rb,4,t5_2wabp

10916010,0,t3_5vy2uc,Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Its a double edged sword.  It all comes down to what is the lifetime of the factory and what is your goal. A single rocket factory is going to be a lot different than one designed to launch multiple rockets in a short time. The difference is a multirocket factory design will work for the single rocket it just requires more overhead.To avoid branching the main bus of this you can have larger branches that they themselves branch similar to arteries and capillaries in the circulatory system. So you can feed a factory section with a minibus off the main bus that branches as needed for production areas. Sharing production lines for similar items works well until it doesnt and you need to expand but you can always refactor. The headache is sometimes refactoring can be orders of magnitudes more complex than just building out expandable production areas.Also to bus gears or not to bus gears that is the question lol.,factorio,de5wqsk,4,t5_2wabp

Well they give you free copies of whatever the machine makes every now and then so for a given amount of production you need fewer resources coming in.Since in an extremely large factory the limiting factor is usually how many resources you can bring in and solar power is free in the long run megabases tend to use production modules and speed beacons everywhere and just deal with the high power usage.,factorio,de9hpx4,1,t5_2wabp

10962307,0,t3_5wjzs9,Im going to take a guess...I think that most of the people in favor of this change actively and consistently browse the new queue.  Those who dislike it probably dont.  Thats just my assumption but I think it makes sense.This is my first stop every time I open up reddit and Im frequently browsing by new.  Besides the excess of island posts which are honestly incredibly annoying Ive seen absolutely way too many posts just of someones first red science setup their first smelting or their first time copying a main bus build everyone uses four lanes....  To even moderately experienced players these posts hold absolutely no interest and theyre so repetitive that I usually just ignore them.  Its not hard to alienate more experienced players if they feel that theyre being drowned out by incessant noob posts.As to your concernsYes this does make it a bit harder for new players to participate.  But honestly I think thats fine.  I wouldnt expect to go to an art subreddit and post my first sketch that I spent an hour on after never having sketched anything before.  And I certainly wouldnt expect a good response.  I think new players are primarily here to learn and if they want to share their excitement then the weekly thread is the perfect place to do so.  Furthermore since you think that the milestone thread will be mostly newcomers I think theyd enjoy that even more instead of a bunch of experienced players who arent impressed at all critiquing their submissions theyll get other new players who share their same excitement and can learn from each other assuming that your assumption is right.As for the second point I strongly disagree.  Most people dont learn anything seeing someones first time automating red science because its so poorly done.  I think the random build submissions we get are more than enough to teach those things.  Edit I also just noticed that this post is currently sitting at a  upvote rate.  Guys please dont downvote just because you disagree with OPs opinion.

I know on my first serious factory I reached a point where I was concerned about having to learn railways to expand outside my original deposits due to powerresource scarcity.  And it was a serious concern because because I didnt incorporate logisticsconstruction robots into my factory which made it very difficult to do and I eventually started a new factory the best part of factorios learning curve.Dont skimp on automating solar panels accumulators flying robot frames walls and laser turrets.Consider those your defense budget and go American with it!That being said  the logistics of a gun turret wall is very fun to set up a few times and I think is a viable strategy especially prior to the five hour endeavor of constructing a refinery and integrating it with your production line.Maybe give the long inserter gun turret daisy chain a try.

I guess I didnt really have to learn how to use them as they are highlevel stuff whereas what I program is supertrivial. See Im a hobbyprogrammer still in school and I just started programming again after taking a break for several months as I didnt exactly know what to do. I started again because I thought about a small project for this weekend and I can tell that after those months I was totally hooked again. If you want to Id love to send you the code so you can have a look at it and tell me what to improve. Its a little terminalbased game about geohazards written in Python. I was really pumped when I finished coding and got all bugs fixed because it took me two days of coding  hours each excluding the time I thought about the general concept.   When I however look at multithreading framebuffers and such I feel so lost and I get the impression that what I do is so small in comparison to what you do. I mean I know how to write classes functions and how to deal with user in and output but thats it. Id really like to get started with more advanced stuff so could you maybe point badumts me in the correct direction so Ill need to use them for something? I generally program python but I know a little Cwhatever. Didnt write Ccode in a pretty long time. I did start with Java Lua and Visual Basic once but thats even worse than C I guess. I mean I didnt even remember C doesnt have classes.EDIT I just looked at my code again and I noticed that whenever I change a variable owned by the class I do it from within a function owned by the class.

Although if you do please give us a week or two to recover from the haunting nightmares of uncooperating conbots For example a rail laying glider could actually be useful in a game. Build a glider that lays tracks in a straight line fending off trees rocks amp biters. There could be a competition for the fastest rail laying glider and a competition for the most reliable glider glider that builds the longest track without being stopped by treesrocksbiters. Could be two types of gliders a tethered glider power supplied from a base and an untethered glider must produce its own power and may not leave anything behind but tracks and chests with artifactswoodrocks.Another suggestion Solar farm building glider. The glider is given a power outlet and a chest with unlimited solar panels power poles roboports accumulators optionally construction bots and anything else useful for solar farms that I may have forgotten. Then build the fastest expanding glider possibly limiting direction it may build to a straight line or it may not be as useful in a game as it could construct on top of other entities.Edit Solar farm probably isnt a good competition.

Been a pleasure each time Ive done a series with him.  ColonelWill Done a lot of playthroughs with him in the past several months and its been really enjoyable. He is probably one of the best people out there with trains and is known for his megabases. If youre looking for someone who pushes the limits of the game highly recommend him over on Twitch. Zisteau If youre looking for a high efficiency style he isnt your guy but if you are looking for something crazy unique and entertaining then give him a watch. He knows the game pretty damn well but uses it in a different way than most to be build really crazy designsbases that are just plain awesome to watch.  Katherine of Sky Very smooth and easy to watchlisten to commentary and content. Does some great beginner tutorials and is generally very good at explaining things.

Plus there are some things that can somewhat snowball to the point where being  seconds earlier on one thing can mean being a few minutes earlier on another thing and so forth down the line.  Additionally if the current tick count or anything similar has any effect on the RNG frameperfect timings can allow that to be utilzed  if waiting  ticks to fire a weapon means that itll do maximum damage rather than minimum damage because the tick counter happens to be at the right amount to make that happen tools can help exploit that.  If youve ever watched a speedrun of the original Pokemon games youll likely see this used to some extent where RNG manipulation is used to encounter precisely the pokemon the player wants to encounter and not others.TAS speedruns are usually compared as an entirely separate category though.Oh and the idea about TAS timings is theyre based on the title in question running at full speed  so a TAS video of Factorio would have one frame per update and play at  FPS regardless of UPS.  TASBot actually can play native versions of games on their original console at full speed and basically replay a TAS speedrun on the real console.,factorio,dg1mqrx,1,t5_2wabp

11633283,0,t3_65yuen,My opinion is that its best to optimise for things that are finite like ores and not for space which is nearly infinite. Assemblers and furnaces are cheap its worth putting in the initial outlay to build more of them in order to save raw materials later.So forget efficiency  power is infinite and pretty cheap just build some more especially once you have blueprints and automated power. And if you want something like circuit production to use less power just use a circuit network or limited chest to turn it off when you have enough produced for your current needs.Productivity is almost always worthwhile  yes it slows down individual machines but furnacesassemblers are also cheap... just build more and you maximise your raw materials.And Speed is used for anything thats infinite oil wells or where productivity is possible beaconsProductivity really stacks up during the late game  eg for a blue circuit assembly  machines and x productivity you get  more green circuits and use them to make  more red and use those to make  more blue circuits... giving you a lot more blue circuits for the same amount of input material. By the time youve used productivity through the whole oil change and copper production you basically get a free Blue Circuit for each  you pay for with resources.Considering how much resource is needed for a blue circuit that REALLY adds up. Sure youll need a few more assembly machines but theyre so much cheaper than blue circuits that its worth it and because you need fewer resources for the same number it actually isnt as bad as youd think,factorio,dgen8i6,7,t5_2wabp
11635096,0,t1_dges5pn,Thats not how path signals work.  The factorio chain signals are the same as openttd chain signals.Path signals allow multiple trains to occupy the same block by reserving tracks within a block.   Other trains can continue to pass through the same block so long as they do not cross a reserved track.The factorio chain signals only allow a single train to be in a block this is why junctions cause huge slowdowns in factorio.  If a train is in any block no other train can pass.  When one train is in the junction block no other trains can enter.,factorio,dgeun70,1,t5_2wabp

Not sure how coal thirsty this would be but if you have sufficient coal and are not burning coal burning it for fuel then this is amazing. ,factorio,dgsker2,3,t5_2wabp

11795633,0,t1_dgx25g9,Biters go inactive when the player leaves the area so the agro is pretty minimal compared with when the player is there. Ive sometimes used this fact to save an outpost which is being overrun just run away really quickly and the biters stop attacking.edit To further clarify. There are two effects of the player being nearby firstly the game will deactivate chunks which are far from the player and the biters freeze altough there are some things which can keep a chunk active beside player presence such as the players machines tho chunks are quite small about the range of a laser turret so nearby biters can still freeze. Secondly when the player is near spawners enter a spawning frenzy state and generate units at a much more rapid rate than usual. Both these effects can be observed quite readily using the . radar vision.,factorio,dgx2pnj,30,t5_2wabp
