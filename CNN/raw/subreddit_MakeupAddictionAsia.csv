This is something that needs to be clarified before the sub takes off.And yes I know brownbeauty exists but there are some of us who are lighter than NC plus that sub is still ultimately about American products and trends. ,MakeupAddictionAsia,cpul164,14,t5_37lan

8060873,0,t1_d4hmp0m,here are two of the visee palettes. Sorry the lighting is terrible! They didnt have them near me but I was in Shibuya today and knew they would be in one of the bigger stores. The first one is a glossy rich eyes palette and the second is a shimmer rich eyes palette. They are very sheer and honestly very glittery. Id call them more powdery then buttery but very soft.,MakeupAddictionAsia,d4m48u0,2,t5_37lan
