1146712,0,t3_26yrnn, Im fond of . We get a lot of walkins from people who just joined the server. Very few peoples first instinct on joining is to go to the nether.a I like domes. There easy but look nice. BTW I built that dome on C and Diff decorated it.  Team effort. b I would not be opposed to another large nice looking central building  feature. I think whatever goes there should have a fairly large open space at ground level. One of the best things about the dome is its an open central meeting point.I think having all hoper intensive designs in one place and out of the way is a solid idea. Weve moved in that direction with the iron farmcane farm and other AFK farms in one place. If we removed the old cane farm and moved the auto smelter out to the AFK farms wed have achieved the goal. Hoppers close to town center are still ok as long as theyre not active most of the time.And taking Twils advice Im going back to playing now...,MCRoseCity,chym910,1,t5_2wz0q
3345955,0,t1_cp1jet9,Idea Make a shipshaped spleef arena with one entrance at port and the other at starboard. It should be flying and incorporate both ice and flowers as part of the design. Stick a few Rose banners on it as well and make it a level spleef. Lose and get keelhauled  swim up from under the sides onto the exit on both sides. Ship should have the water be restricted to prevent losers from getting lost and dying in the arena.,MCRoseCity,cp9nx30,1,t5_2wz0q
