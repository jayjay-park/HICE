9526884,0,t1_d9nb8az,Also looking at the listing again the seller Guarantees  day shipping...that most likely means that this is a presale item and that it is not actually in stock at the moment. Do you really want to wait  months to get your kit? Go with Dream House,lepin,d9ne1ml,1,t5_3g92s
10076135,0,t1_dbkmtsz,Huh I wonder if they did something else with the manual on that one because the one that came with my falcon was near perfect I had no issues with the colors.,lepin,dbkxwwy,1,t5_3g92s
10167810,0,t1_dbt5fuy,Heres mine Print quality of instruction manual is indistinguishable from Lego  parts were missing or even faulty All parts even the Technic ones fitting perfectly Solid playable model which is not standard for UCS modelsSo  for quality.Building experience   nothing demanding surprising. I find the UCS space ships generally more fun to build Slave I and BWing making the top of the list. TIE fighter on the other hand was super boring because due to its double symmetry youre building four times the same thing.,lepin,dbwksea,3,t5_3g92s

10464691,0,t1_dctyjoj,So the decool instructions would be different? Would I be able to get from start to finish with the LEGO ones? ,lepin,dcua23y,1,t5_3g92s
10468953,0,t1_dcuixsm,Haha I think we all found the same problems! I managed to build It properly but I spent two hours placing everything in place with surprising patience not very common part of my personality. It was quite frustrating but eventually everything came un place. The instructions are simply not enough in that area and I had to move half of those plates full of small pieces to assemble the real thing. Again this is a problem of the original design. This kind of solution would never be allowed in . ,lepin,dcurh5w,2,t5_3g92s
10525774,0,t1_dd12abr,Thanks.  seems very repetitive in terms of design and it uses the Town Hall reddish brown which I absolutely loathe as I find it too bright and saturated when compared to other modulars. That combined with commonplace tan and LBG doesnt make it a good parts pack for me either. has a much more interesting interior but the exterior isnt my cup of tea. No interesting colors either.I kind of wish Lepin would start just selling a set of bricks in one color including pieces not done by Lego in that color. I would jump on that immediately. It would also solve their legal problems. Come to think of it why has no one done that? Too small a market? But I digress.,lepin,dd17lwv,2,t5_3g92s
10539683,0,t3_5qts39,I got the UCS Star Destroyer so far a couple of pieces missing. Im also noticing that some blocks dont actually fit together very tightly. Im a few days into it and I think the glue is about to come out. Hope you have more luck than me. ,lepin,dd2sg9s,1,t5_3g92s

10747040,0,t1_ddocgqw,I have the Arocs and the Wheel originals. They are both complex designs. But there are others that should be painful to build by Lepins standards too. Most of the flagship sets are un this list.I recently finished my Lepins Tydirium and it is marvelous. But then you have the problem of the wings and you have a simple connection there. The solution is simple but if you have that kind of problem with something as simple as that I cant imagine how frustrating could be the Wheel the Arocs or the Crane MKII. Talking about electric engines.. well. That is not a problem. It is am isolated feature and you can switch to Lego ones if needed. As someone said before maybe Decool could help here as their overall quality for technic bricks is better than Lepin. Lets wait and see.,lepin,ddoh4h5,1,t5_3g92s
10761623,0,t3_5twcg2,I ordered the same thing from HampH on the th. Just got the shipping email tonight. Has a tracking number which seems legit. I live in the middle of nowhere so I cant imagine they have more than one order going to the middle of my particular nowhere.  So Im encouraged!,lepin,ddpzcxa,1,t5_3g92s
10762277,0,t1_ddq0csg,Any Aliexpress cashback service. I guess they are different for different countries so you have to pick by yourself from available services. Google for more info.,lepin,ddq1s9z,2,t5_3g92s
10800313,0,t3_5ufrnb,I had to use super glue for the ISD the magnets were just too strong and kept ripping themselves off the plates. Use loctite gel control for very easy control and quick drying. Put it on within secs your good to go no mess.,lepin,ddtz4g9,2,t5_3g92s
10837557,0,t1_ddxrp83,Aliexpress sellers also have it formally but see the thread Ive linked in reality theres no Decool supplies after chinese new year.Decool version should reappear later.,lepin,ddxtfkp,1,t5_3g92s

10947121,0,t1_de93vus,Especially with the detectives office. The colors are almost all off especially the orange and blue its just not good.

11012276,0,t3_5x59z0,My vote would be the Millennium Falcon or Rexs ATTE. They were both really fun and two of my favorites ,lepin,deg7lh8,1,t5_3g92s
