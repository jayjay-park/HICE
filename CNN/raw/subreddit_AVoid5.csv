8639238,0,t1_d6ks8pc,A troubling situation is that if your brain starts to adjust to it you start doing it in nonAVoid too. I found that a good starting tip is to look at your glyphboard not your monitor. Watch that fifth glyph during typing constantly. You will mostly avoid it slipping in your posts if your focus might slip. This way you can focus on thinking about words that do not contain that fifth glyph without it slipping in by lapsus.,AVoid5,d6lihxv,1,t5_3fr2z
