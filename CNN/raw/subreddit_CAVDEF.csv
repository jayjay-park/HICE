7340122,0,t1_d2bb7ys,I believe caucuses are a bad thing because it makes it harder for people to vote that do not have  hours to be apart of the entire process. One of my main interests is in maximizing voter turn out. This should be a nonpartisan issue so the fact that Bernie has been doing better in caucus states is a non sequitur.I dont entirely understand Concordet Method yet but thank you for pointing out the flaw and giving me something to read up on.It is ridiculously that we have campaign seasons that start  days before the general election. There are countries that have as little as two weeks for the campaign season. People get campaign fatigue and it is way too expensive. However I agree that rallies debates town halls and just getting out and meeting people is a good way for candidates to get exposure. Especially if the candidates cant just rely on name recognition. We dont want to be in a situation were we merely vote for political celebrities.I know we need someone in office to enact change at local and national levels. I am trying to build and explore a platform for this kind of reform so that we can have some kind of roadmap that is clearly defined and understood. Something fully explored with noted weaknesses and strengths.,CAVDEF,d2cisr2,1,t5_3dd5d

7406897,0,t3_4gpkbj,Yes were very sorry. So sorry. I hope we didnt discourage people from voting. If they found they werent registered anymore and left without filling out a ballot well were sorry about that. Here as a sign of good faith well count these ballots that are eligible you know the ones we werent going to coun... oh I mean.. well... well count them.By the way we run a clean shop over here. Our staff works with integrity! Well except for Ms. HaslettRudiano were upholding her suspension. We hope you still trust the electoral process in our fair city! Hope you all still came out to vote! And if you found your polling center was closed hours after it was supposed to be open we hope you stayed!...s,CAVDEF,d2k46hw,3,t5_3dd5d
7511785,0,t3_4i799b,Dont know if its the same type of machine but when I went to vote last year my first time I pushed just like this and didnt realize for a minute that theres a keypad thing at the bottom you have to use to vote. If it is the same type of machine then I think the person is actually pushing the part that lights up when you vote for the candidate on the keypad.,CAVDEF,d2w1wiv,2,t5_3dd5d

7691740,0,t1_d3gf7hd,Thats because everyone IS anonymous. It isnt the name of a group with defined specific members its a hat anyone can wear. Its intended to be that.Certain people wear the hat more frequently than others but the notion that anyone can claim to be anonymous belies a lack of understanding as to how the group actually works.,CAVDEF,d3gi2au,2,t5_3dd5d

8380686,0,t1_d5p4lxk,i think he would be very happy to especially if the angle of tapping into bernie supporters woulld sweeten the deal there always hasta be something in this for him but thinkabout it the dems have ruined their brand and firing little debs doesnt do a damn thing about that and what is trump king of branding yeah there is definitely a way to approach him with this that would be appealing and to remind everyone daily about crooked hillary and how she played bernie over  over over an over again seems logical to me,CAVDEF,d5p4uey,1,t5_3dd5d
