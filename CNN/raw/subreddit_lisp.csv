10864,0,t1_ceez5bn,gt Python succeed because it did not have a strong close source implementation.Python succeeded because people like the syntax and Lisp failed because people dont like the syntax. Thats it. Every other organisational problem the Lisp ecosystem may have pale compared to the fact that people simply do not like the damn syntax and choose to write their domain knowledge down in some other language and not in Lisp.All the problems you mention are present in the C world even more than in Lisp but in the C world nobody cares that there are GCC MSVC ICC CLANG etc. Also there are various incompatible JavaScript engines browsers frameworks and they are all a PITA and still nobody cares because they can grok the syntax.While you can object that javaScripts syntax doesnt matter because JavaScript bootstrapped its popularity through getting embedded in the browser Python bootstrapped its popularity on syntax alone.,lisp,cefo6sh,2,t5_2qh35

Terms written using these indices are invariant with respect to  conversion so the check for equivalence is the same as that for syntactic equality. Each De Bruijn index is a natural number that represents an occurrence of a variable in a term and denotes the number of binders that are in scope between that occurrence and its corresponding binder.

However if the cache mishit occurs I guess it would be rare you can just switch back to the normal GF since there is no new language syntax.Also note that if the surrounding environment contains type information most branches of the dispatch tree in ematch can be safely detected unreachable by the compiler like SBCL. For example the compilation result of the code below does not contain dispatching actually.    defun funcusinginlinedplusandtypeadded a b      Thanks to the nature of inlining    smart compilers like sbcl can detect certain branches are not reachable    thus removing the checks and reducing the code size.

9296919,0,t1_d8udwts,Youre right about that. My original idea was to try and contact the folks for the project or projects that we might be interested in and then see if we have permission to take over. However I did take a look at most of them and frankly they seem to be either very narrow in their scope or some sort of pet project of limited general interest. Of course thats just my opinion. I kind of lost interest after that.That being said if someone is interested and the original authors dont respond to mails Im not sure if one could migrate them and possibly change the terms of licence.,lisp,d8ug8vg,1,t5_2qh35
