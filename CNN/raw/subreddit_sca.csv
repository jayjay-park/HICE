650275,0,t3_21j9ml,Although I am a white Canadian guy nothing about this organization makes me more uncomfortable than the thoughtless cultural appropriation I see other members of the group sometimes engaging in. Let me be clear  I have no problem with the idea of someone taking on a persona from a culture that is outside their own heritage. What I do have a problem with is that there is very rarely any thought given to the historical context of taking on a particular persona.If you have Incan heritage I think that a period appropriate Incan persona is a a very cool idea. If you dont... Well I think you should think long and hard about the significance of taking on a for fun in my spare time identity of a member of a culture that was systematically scattered and nearly destroyed by Europeans. Here in Canada our government was officially actively trying to erase our native peoples cultures up until the midNineties. Incans exist today and still feel the profound effects of these historical interactions with European peoples. Do you think they would be comfortable with the idea?Here are some good links for further reading.

2923507,0,t1_co0d16u,Maan any tourney Ive been a party to loved being outside as compared to inside because its easier to be period outside and we get more space that way.  If the Crown is requiring an indoor space talk to your Marshal in Charge  theyll know how much space you want for fighting and search for any spaces larger than that.  Multipurpose roomsgyms are great if you can get some fairground space that would do the job those exhibit buildings are great for that churches are workable if you get the right ones and of course schools work out pretty well too.  As for your vigil requirements youll typically know about a month or two beforehand.  Ive had notice as little as two weeks but I was strongly expecting some kind of vigil so I had space set aside.  The nice thing here is that you can expect vigil for  people usually depends on your Crown but most like to keep elevations to a handful per Court to keep people there less.  Like I said before just a normal sized room or a tent the vigil team will set up is more than enough space and weve pulled tents off with indoor events and any space not utilized can be repurposed into privy chambers for anyone else you might need the Coronet if youre in a Barony nap space for yourself etc..Now its not that I hate autocrating but Ive been in the Society for but two years at this point and Ive run two Kingdomlevel mini events a Kingdomlevel regular event and I endeavor to run a lunch inn andor a straight bar at any other events I can finagle the spot for.My kingdomlevel event was short notice for me because a friend of mine was going to run it and then had to back out at the witching hour due to other priorities so I stepped up and took over and pretty much the entire Barony was fatigued at that point and didnt want to do much to assist the setup.  I spent a lot of weekends at the site doing setup so I was dog tired day of.

I remember noticing creepy old fucks when I got about ten men whos gaze lingered too long who were too friendly who stood too close. Being a girl really means you grow up expecting this crap its sad. I dont think men have any ides what its like knowing its there and what it feels like to be looked up and felt up that way at such a young age.Anyway We had a local guy years ago who  uhm... macked on many of the college girls. When his wife was in the other room. He was widely known as a creepy perv. BUt one in good standing awards wise so most looked away no judging thing. I have always been the type to go  NO we SHOULD judge. Make them flat out uncomfortable.Later on when he was a bit drunk and a new years party he got a little handsy with a  year old who had always seen him as one of her uncles. The a few of the guys got in his face when word got back a little later at the party.What pissed me off was I had just been there just before the incident happened that was a packed hallway there were like  people with in  feet. I had seen the two talking. NO ONE there stopped it as it was happening. They had to have seen it but no one did a thing. Something only happened when the girl mentioned it to someone who mentioned it to her dad.In other kingdoms there have been pedophiles arrested within the SCA for acts during SCA activities. Its why we now have rules no childrens activities can happen without at least  adults but its not enough. Not nearly enough.Too many parents let their kids run free at events trusting those around them far too much to intervene. Most of these people are relative strangers add to that newcomers mundane explorers and just those weirdos we DO know that give US the creeps. You know those neckbeards.

7907413,0,t3_4njcss,The way I make them is by using basic geometry.  Youll want a circle for your neck within the bigger circle of the cloak.  Given that Cr youll want to know the circumference of your neck plus an inch so you dont choke!.  Lets say you have about a  neck.  A  circumference will give you a radius of a little less than ..  Fold your material in quarters if its .   At the corner where there is no selvage so if you fold the fabric in half length wise to the right and then fold it width wise down youll be looking at the upper left corner measure down . from the corner.  Mark the . at various points.   Now what ever length you want your cloak to be lets say  add that . and measure from that same corner down the . in this case.  Mark multiple spots for the . length.  Once you have enough spots marked for the length cut along that line and the one that is at the . mark.  Hem line and add ties.   Heres a picture to better explain.  the blue lines are the cutting lines for the cloak.  The red line is if you want to add a hood.   Its a pretty horrible picture that I did in paint but hopefully it will help.  A somewhat simpler way you can make one is with trapezoids.  Ive done that recently for a young girls cape   You can see her wearing it here  With the trapezoid method it wont be a perfect circle but it does come out pretty well  you just need to know the neck circumference and use that divided out among the top of the trapezoids.  The bottom of the trapezoid can be as big as you like.  ,sca,d44v9jv,3,t5_2qhzo

However the further you go from the core of Medieval and Renaissance Europe the less the environment we offer will resemble what someone of your time and country would find natural or homelike. For example you can be an Asian or African guest at a European court but you cannot expect others to share your special interests   like any longterm visitor in a foreign land you are the one who will have to adapt to the customs you find around you. Since members have free choice of what areas they will explore it follows that Society branches cannot decide to specialize in a specific time and place since that would make it hard for members there to pursue their own interests in other times and places.In other words there is no restriction but there might not be many resources available to learn from or activities in common.,sca,db8szq5,19,t5_2qhzo

11088665,0,t1_deoakf6,The SCA has a Historical Combat Studies rule set under artsampsciences. It allows for pretty much all HEMA techniques but no sparring.My club was originally supposed to be a SCA guild working under the HCS rules. But I got shut down due to BS politics combat marshalls demanding control over the program in direct violation of the HCS rules baronial AampS demanding preapproval before every class despite no other AampS class having that restriction A duke who happened to run his own commercial HEMA club banning us until they developed Caid specific rules in addition to the HCS rules. He never did write those rules.I stuck around for another year or so after forming my own club but it soon became clear the SCA was never going to be the right venue for our research. ,sca,deow2fl,2,t5_2qhzo

11592309,0,t3_65fv9k,There were definitely very artistic pieces of maille armor. Gilded or brass rings being probably the most popular way of doing it but keep in mind that functionality was the main factor here. Of course gold and brass are weaker than steel but actually if you are decked out head to toe in expensive goldtrimmed maille then youre more likely to be captured than be killed. So its actually a  to armor class in an outofthebox sort of way.Heres a period depiction Ive found of some gilded maille the fellow in the center with the gilded bascinet and aventailFor a very highquality repro look at Toby Capwells pizan for his black harness the maille was done by Erik Schmid. closeup,sca,dg9zvtu,2,t5_2qhzo
