588364,0,t1_cg75aj0,This is true.  However the way it worked in Aytos the wheat buying and XPcrafting was all done by me and the Meat Market not by the government.  It was a publicprivate partnership in that the government provided the farms originally but after that point the buying and crafting were a completely private operation.So if anyone went bankrupt it actually would have been me personally.,CivCraftAytos,cg75g64,3,t5_2yfow

2831578,0,t1_cnpq0ns,Oh not at all.  Under our PR system splitting a party doesnt actually hurt it.If two parties have a platform that is close the people who like those ideas will rank both those parties over all others.  So maybe instead of ORPA getting two seats there would be two centrist parties with one seat each who because of their similar positions probably will ally in parliament and vote as a bloc.  The votes dont ever get wasted the voters just get more choices.Also nothing stops candidates from being on more than one party list it only matters that a party thinks a candidate is a good person to represent their ideas.  So if you wanted to join or create a different party you wouldnt even necessarily have to leave ORPA.,CivCraftAytos,cnpy1xi,1,t5_2yfow

4446707,0,t1_csr6f4q,no it really doesnt. We claim a massive amount of land. There is that island our main island the one east of us up to NS claims the one south of us west of my island and a swamp area. He doesnt even cover half the small forest island there. Not only is it not deep into aytos claims its so far away from the main city we wouldnt even run into him much. Also his  chunk claim is more for render distance because if ur boting and a snitch is hit that u have rendered it auto logs u off.,CivCraftAytos,csr6z71,2,t5_2yfow

4556310,0,t1_ct4wxxo,Yeah it could be abused but it would at least be harder to abuse than it is right now. I seriously think we should all write up mock constitutions that reflect a perfect aytos government in their mind and then try to compromise between them. I think we get a mediator like xavter to help us with it too to try to cut bias although xavter would want us to join the western empire so we should probably find a random with  interest in aytos like that one chanada guy who popped into our channel that one time. We also have to remember that not everyone is going to like everything but we have to get it so most people like most things because if we want to have a perfect constitution that will take years to make.,CivCraftAytos,ct4xyvn,3,t5_2yfow
