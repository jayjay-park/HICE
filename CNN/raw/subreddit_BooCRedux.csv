8496450,0,t1_d63fxoc,I feel the same way. The BOOC I loved has gone. The atmosphere at the new one is different and just shittier. Hopefully this place ends up being better.,BooCRedux,d63lvoj,10,t5_3fher
8565533,0,t1_d6bjq9d,I love Dark Tower but never finished it time to start looking for it again. Currently reading The Kings Justice by Stephen R Donaldson who is also an awesome old school scififantasy writer. The Kings Justice has a vibe vaguely similar to Dark Tower though its strictly dark fantasy rather than having scifi elements. The Talisman and Rose Madder were two S.K. books I also loved heck he has a ton of great stuff.,BooCRedux,d6c9r0e,3,t5_3fher

8973423,0,t3_52ye5k,Open comment to the altright kids of reddit youre not fooling anyone with the I was die hard liberal until the regressive left went too far in the last year silliness.  No one whos been politically aware for more than  months buys this idea that the left changed too much for you to support it anymore.  It hasnt.  The Democratic Party wasnt the party who nominated a candidate whose positions are contrary to its historic principles.  You fell in deep love with an orange strongmanwannabe after having zero political convictions whatsoever because you like that he says the same ignorant and bigoted things you traders of dank Pepes do.  Just own it boys.  Its sad that he fulfills some Daddy needs that your own fathers and stepfathers couldnt but your teen puppylove is just that it in no way reflects poorly on the liberalism you still couldnt define even if we held a gun to your XBox.  Disclaimer this isnt an invitation for a libs vs. commies debate either.  Not interested.,BooCRedux,d7qgx6v,2,t5_3fher
