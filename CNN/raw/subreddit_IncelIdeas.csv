9393394,0,t3_592vzb,Im going to address the bullet points without considering women at all since none of these would objectively benefit women in the least. Thats half of American society that already dont benefit.Im just going to focus on how men dont benefit.gt Girls clitoris should be cutSome men like clitorises. Theyre rather fun. Ditching the clitoris makes it harder to please your wife and if your wife is laying there bored during sex unless you have concrete for brains youll develop serious self esteem issues.gt A man can unilaterally divorce his wife a woman needs her husbands consent to divorce .That one does benefit men I suppose for all the wrong reasons.gt A divorced wife loses custody of all children over  years of age or when they exceed it.So the man is automatically stuck with the children? How does that help anyone?gt Testimonies of four male witnesses are required to prove rape against a woman.So a man can rape my wife and gets off scotfree just because I didnt bring my buddies to watch. Great. I benefit so much from going to jail after killing my wifes attacker out of revenge because our legal system fucked me.gt A woman who has been raped cannot testify in court against her rapists.I suppose thats great for the rapist but how does it help anyone else? A lot of these laws are very advantageous to rapists for some reason.gt A woman cannot speak alone to a man who is not her husband or relative.So my wife cannot assist with several different categories of errands. Hell she cant even be an adult. I have to hold her hand in any situation where she might encounter someone and speak with them.,IncelIdeas,d96ogns,2,t5_3h672
9418946,0,t1_d996xij,Why should anybody care for you over them? As a people we in the west have decided that rape is bad you want us to abandon that because youre too pathetic to function without a lay? Society cares for their physical weakness when their bodies give out and while I do sometimes wonder if its the solution it is the solution we collectively have decided upon. The difference is you want society to compensate for your emotional weakness by allowing you to control another person as you see fit. You are the weak one and as such you should fix yourself go see a therapist and if thoughts of raping somebody occur again then have yourself admitted to a psychiatric facility.,IncelIdeas,d99x09x,9,t5_3h672
