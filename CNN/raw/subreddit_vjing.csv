465263,0,t3_1zfegq,This is my project. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback!Readme fileA lightsynth based on LSystems and inspired by snowflakes. Features a performance control panel several modulation sources and limited MIDI support for TouchDesigner users.This is built in TouchDesigner a commercial system but there is a noncommercial version available and this should work in the TouchPlayer environment as well. It can be a little system intensive so  bit is recommended for best results.flakedD.  lfo modulators fully modular  add your own LSystem rules see below on screen projector controls  can now support TouchPlayer Now includes mappable audio reactivity  band EQ  pick freq lowest frequency through freq highest frequency and control the master volume. midi  if you have a midimap set up this uses lots of sliders or knobs. You can assign midi slider or audioMidi knob to your midimap names at flakedsettings. This table is kind of the brains of the app.Requirements TouchDesigner or TouchPlayer Windows only sorry  Lsystem Rules Write your own rules and save a text file in the LSystems directory. Please note if you have systems that are sigificantly more complex it is highly recommended to set a condition to limit the max generations on the rules. For example see travellers.txtFFFFFtlt On the end tlt is the condition. This says execute this rule while generations are less than . Without this safety condition in place you will find that this LSystem will cause TouchDesigner to crash on most systems if you have your generations slider set above  or .Examples of output  ,vjing,cft5hab,1,t5_2s4gv

701149,0,t3_22742v,Wow funny you bring this up. The visuals were done by my good friend Kendall Clark. Search Kendall Clark music to find more info but he runs visuals for a club down in Austin called empire garage. Heard Entertainment books up in NY and down in Austin. He is gonna be stoked to see this. ,vjing,cgjz1lu,3,t5_2s4gv
922934,0,t3_24ohu3,Awesome.   Props to your pops for the moment Im struggling to make anything cool happen.  What software will give me an output that I can send to Resolume?   Im trying to get a realtime EQ from VLC using SpoutCam but cant pick anything up.  Is anyone having any luck? ,vjing,ch96yle,1,t5_2s4gv
961597,0,t3_253ox6,Everything I work with is on Mac this is just happened to be how it is. Quartz VDMX etc. I love it. I tried building a mac tower TonyMac build for projection. I had issues because I could never get the sound drivers to work and lost some functionality with my audio reactivity. It was a pain to carry around I had to bring a monitor that wasnt great and I quickly got irritated and switched back to mac book pro losing all the power I built it for.I recently because I am working on a large project invested in a new top of the MacPro as a business expenditure that I will write off pay for itself in the next year or two and I have been happy with it. It has yet to hitch once with all that I throw at it up to  layers of quartz patches with HD video feeds and HD video. I love it but it is expensive. So with this new MacPro  in the unit itself without using TripleHeadsGo I have the ability to run  projectors on thunderbolt natively. I use my HDMI out with a Touchscreen Monitor for control. The MacPro weighs maybe lbs buts tiny and fits in an easy rolling case with my touch screen monitor a wireless keyboard and a mouse. I have a custom built stage setup that has my macpro in a ventilated protected area. My touch screen monitor angled slight  about chest level so I can look down and control what I need to a keyboard right under that as necessary. And I use a Livid RGBSlim for controlling and cueing and all the other stuff. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. I run an artnet I run all the video I want and compared to the last tower everything packs in half the size. It works for me but that is me.I know people who have built computers into actual flight cases with wheels and a monitor and have had no issues. PC and a TonyMac build. At the end of the day its where you dreams are where you are and what you need to get there. But I can tell you if you get a new MacBookPro with a  thunderbolt outs  hdmi out  the NvidiaM maxxed out ram. You have a  projector running macbook that should have no issue handling a lot of what you throw at it. I infact have both my retina MBP and MPro and for my larger projects I use them both and love them both. If you got any questions for me ask or PM man.,vjing,chdlce8,3,t5_2s4gv

2078516,0,t3_2imqs7,Great clips. My only suggestion provide a version that uses a completely black background and white as the primary. That way others can always use it as an alpha mask a front alpha layer and be able to hue shift without tweaking the background color. Good work!,vjing,cl40whx,3,t5_2s4gv

2422954,0,t1_cmayzok,hey youre definitely right that worked.  However it is now synchronized to the BPM but is it possible to have it reactive specifically to the sound?   In other words I dont want it to react when the songs are quiet. I can turn on external audio FFT input but thats only reactive through the computers mic.  the Midi coming through the ethernet has to have this data right?,vjing,cmb6osj,1,t5_2s4gv
2428698,0,t3_2na70u,If you already know about vfx and animation and youve messed with resolume and stuff like that youre in good shape.Easiest most basic way to start is to make clips and loops in dd animation software and then use vj software like resolume or others to display it trigger it and control it on whatever displays you have available.The rest is all up to you and your creativity.  Personally I make clips in programs like CinemaD and Aftereffects and then use Resolume to map them to projection surfaces.  Ive also been messing with using various things like cameras and Arduinopowered touch surfaces to trigger clips and create live input.,vjing,cmbw74y,3,t5_2s4gv

3982679,0,t1_cra6nfx,I agree on the small size thats the reason I built my current setup based on a microATX and small case for DJing. It really sucks lugging around a huge tower to gigs. But Im mostly going to be doing projecting mapping to  projectors at a time and maybe another output to a splitter that would run all the TVs. The issue Ive been running into is having the outputs and processing power to run  seperate projectors AND a set of TVs  total outputs.,vjing,cra9e8b,1,t5_2s4gv
4052733,0,t3_36smtt,You want to encode in several different resolutions and in several different formats. H  is pretty widely accepted but ideally HAP or DXV codecs for GPU acceleration are important. Youll want p and p. Most VJs arent going to use k or k. Not many projectors out that arent beyond expensive that handle those resolutions. VJ programs dont downsample to lower resolutions easily and even if they did the size difference in the file makes it pointless to even consider doing so in most cases.Who wants to run k at p and still have the CPU overhead of a huge file? by Kyle Lyons is the place to be and also check out VJUnion.net Also watch out about selling to European customers with the whole VAT deal. Its killer.,vjing,cri8r8f,1,t5_2s4gv
4460205,0,t3_3c5rim,Before I started VJing I spent a couple months doing practice sessions of about  minutes.

6208158,0,t1_cyv1kpr,Also right now Im using the canvas D API. I find the main perfomance bottleneck comes from a limited amount of calls that can be made into the API every ms to keep a steady framerate at fps.I havent thoroughly tested this number but it comes out to about  calls per frame on my hardware which severely limits the amount of things that can be painted and it could be less actually. Consider that to paint a rotated image for example you need at least two calls one for rotating or setting the transform the other for actually painting the image.Since were talking about a particle engine my machine starts to stutter at less than  particles per frame and this is ONLY because of that calling limit.  At this point this matters a lot more than object creationdisposal.I will soon start using the webgl API since I can move a lot of code into fragmentvertex shaders and reduce the amount of calls made from javascript while simultaneously enabling the rendering of several tens of thousands of particles per frame.,vjing,cyvau4c,1,t5_2s4gv

9182695,0,t3_562ila,The obvious gear like my computer and controllers their associated power and USB cables and a power strip. For certain familiar gigs this is all I need. For unfamiliar gigs I try to gather intel beforehand about what will be necessary. For these gigs I still usually bring a couple backup adapters and associated cables in case plan A doesnt pan out and I need to be flexible about output type. Often times I bring an extension cord or two in case power isnt as close as Id hoped it would be. The key is communication ahead of time about what you need and what can be provided and how to fill in the gaps. Plus always have a plan B!,vjing,d8fz2xk,2,t5_2s4gv
9199960,0,t1_d8i4i5p,there are drivers for the IS for windows  but depending on motherboardlaptop it might not work as they dont like to verify any hardware. But ive got one working in windows  with resolume fine.The next thing i was going to suggest was to try leaving it running and using the layer opacity to control so see if that works for you.If its not regular is there anything else the computers being used for? any audio recordingmonitoring... might have resource spikes which cause the hitching?Otherwise not sure what might cause it. Contact Magewell to see if they know its a feature also try contacting resolume to see if they are aware of anyone else having the same problem.,vjing,d8i5vbf,1,t5_2s4gv

This is going to be my live setup as house VJlighting tech pretty much every night for a wide variety of shows. Resolume has some elegant Artnet RGB control built in and having some nice clips of a few premade patterns would let me do patterns match video setup more complex audio reactivity etc. Essentially just a lot of flexibility.That being said Im probably going to program all the DMX fixtures in touchdesigner so I might just do the LEDs in that too.
