Musk elaborated on this on Neil deGrasse Tysons StarTalk podcastgtNDT Of course what we all really want are flying cars.gtMusk Do you?gtNDT laugh Yes!gtMusk Actually let me ask this... are you sure you want a flying car?gtNDT No but it looks cool.gtMusk Ok. It does look cool. Whenever you see cities in some futuristic concept they always throw the flying car in there.gtNDT You cant tell me youve never thought of it.gtMusk No Ive thought a lot about it. And theres some people I know who are working on flying cars or flying personal transport devices if you will.gtNDT Hoverboards.gtMusk laugh There are people working on hoverboards! ... I am debating like should there be flying cars or shouldnt there be flying cars? Im of two minds on that. Cause if there are flying cars then obviously you have added this additional dimension where now a car could potentially fall on your head. And it would be susceptible to weather. And of course youd have to have a flying car where it would be like an autopilot because otherwise forget it. Its gotta be autopilot. Even in an autopilot scenario and even if youve got redundant motors and blades youve still gone from nearzero chance of something falling on your head to something greater than that. And theres also a noise challenge...gtMusk Something I think that would definitely help a lot in cities is more tunnels. Essentially with a flying car youre talking about going D. And theres a fundamental flaw with cities where youve got dense office buildings and apartment buildings and duplexes and theyre operating on three dimensions but then you go to the street and suddenly youre two dimensional.gtNDT Because its a flat surface.gtMusk Yeah.gtNDT This is how New York City solved this with the subway going underneath  multiple layers of subway. gtMusk Right.gtNDT So we are actually traveling in three dimensions but below the ground rather than in the air.gtMusk Yes. But I believe it you were to extrapolate that to cars and have more car tunnels then you would alleviate congestion completely in cities. gtNDT And you wouldnt need the flying car.gtMusk You would not need a flying car in that case. And it would always work even if the weathers bad.gtNDT It would never ice up.gtMusk It would never ice up and it would not fall on your head.gtNDT laugh Were gonna get started on that right away.After the interview he clarified on twittergtelonmusk Contrary to press reports Im not against flying cars. Just said it was important to consider both pros and cons.gtelonmusk Flying car pros travel in D fast. Cons risk of car falling on head much greater noisy grounded in bad weathergtelonmusk Reasons I like tunnels you still travel in D fast but immune to weather quiet and no risk cars fall on your headgtelonmusk Right move is try both tunnels and flying cars. Otherwise having D streets and D buildings means bad traffic forever.,BoringCompany,dbghm25,2,t5_3i1oo
11803005,0,t1_dgxt170,I dont expect failure to be sure but an unmitigated success is also unlikely. Tunnels have the advantage of being far less tested than most road systems so they could change this balance significantly its true.Even so there is a point at which more wont really help more longterm at least short term possibly too.,BoringCompany,dgxwtuj,1,t5_3i1oo
