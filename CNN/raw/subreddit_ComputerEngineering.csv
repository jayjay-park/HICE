5604367,0,t3_3rvp52,I am not sure as far as speaking language...But for programming I would recommend CC.  C is used for a lot of low level stuff as well as embedded systems. Very important in Computer Engineering.,ComputerEngineering,cwrrxrw,2,t5_2x2ar
6124359,0,t3_3zbwj2,Most of the unis here are good look for something with a focus on engineering. As much as rankings are silly anything in the top  on here is probably a good choice. Most people responding are a bit biased to their own unisalma maters. Disclosing my bias I attend The University of Texas at Austin for ECE specifically comp arch and I think its a fantastic program. ,ComputerEngineering,cylrxwa,1,t5_2x2ar

6177607,0,t1_cw7795e,I believe jobs of this kind are often described as hardware engineering as well. Not  on that but could be good to look up. But everyone else is correct about comp eng or electrical eng. I believe hardware engineering is a specialization available for either major,ComputerEngineering,cyrtvpt,2,t5_2x2ar

10869734,0,t1_de0p9m8,Okey and and  more question how can you practise as a computer engineering student? I know there are things like lego etc. but are there ways to practise for cheap after having studied ce? With software engineering people can practise for free i know with computer engineering its going to be needed to invest in practise material but what is smart?,ComputerEngineering,de14w6a,2,t5_2x2ar
