9011967,0,t1_d7uzy8d,la Bajada is a good trail for stock vehicles once you get on top of the mesa you can drive for a long way on the power line road I believe it ends up around Santa Fe. The only overlandingMemes road I know of are in different areas I normally go in the woods when I do a long trip. Youll be around Alamogordo so you could try going up the mountain to Cloudcroft and checking out the Benson ridge trail and rim trail. Both of those go for a while and are fun but a little out of the way for you.,NMOffroad,d7v3jdt,2,t5_3552y
