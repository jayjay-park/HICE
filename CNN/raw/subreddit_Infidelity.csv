3121398,0,t3_2vv64y,While I have been this guy once and I truly feel for you this cant play out well. Suppose you find nothing and shes loyal. Youre still the ass who didnt trust her and tried to set up a sting on her. Which is still very likely to end the relationship. Trust or bounce friend. Save yourself the heartache either way. ,Infidelity,colj5my,1,t5_2raxb
3752992,0,t1_cqizfzd,Yes I mean my kids are the only reason Im still in my marriage.  My oldest was  when the A happened my youngest had just had her first birthday that week.  I grew up in a broken home and I didnt want my children to go through that.  Its now been seven years and when I see my children growing up happy I know I made the right decision even though its costing me emotionally.  They have no idea what happened between their dad and me.  My youngest will be off to college in nine years and I will reevaluate my options then  DH wants to remain in the marriage so any change is up to me.  I know I can maintain the status quo until then Im almost halfway there.  FYI for us this was a onenight stand A that hadnt happened before in our relationship but I feel very strongly that even once is a deal breaker.  Wed had a conversation about that before we got married bc I had a BF who cheated and I made it clear that I wouldnt tolerate it again.  If it happened again an immediate separation would occur and I would not protect the kids from the reason why.I agree that the first six months are important for you both to consider your options.  Fingers crossed that you find a place where you can both heal and move forward with whats best for you as a family.,Infidelity,cqk2gg4,1,t5_2raxb

8236759,0,t3_4qi2nb,I know Im not your wife but this sounds very familiar. Im F and my hubbie is M. Weve been married for  years and have had many ups and downs. About a year ago we were in a down and I met a man at the local coffee shop think big coffee chain. He is  years older than me very fit handsome with gorgeous salt n pepper hair. I would see him ever week or so and then more as the weeks went on. After  months of this and my marriage still in a valley I decided to ask him out. Being  yo he was a little surprised but gladly accepted. Our first date was amazing. He held my hand put his arm around me when I got chilly... It was just amazing. Our second date he asked me out. We went to a play and then a romantic dinner at his house. Not only was he kind thoughtful very handsome and fit he was very well off. We ate dinner under the stars on his balcony. We drank wine and even danced. My heart was so full. After drinking another bottle of wine I led him to the couch where I sat him down and knelt in front of him. He tried to stop me but I told him I wanted to and he let me. I unbuttoned his shirt and then undid his pants. I took off my top and bra and then I pulled his dick out. Among being one of the best guys Ive ever known he was very big. He was so thankful. I knew it then that the connection I felt he felt it to. Im still married but seeing C all the time. My hubbie knows but I told him Im only staying because of our son.If you have a connection with someone then you have a connection. C is amazing and an amazing lover. Im so glad Im with him.,Infidelity,d575faq,1,t5_2raxb

9473090,0,t1_d9fbrxg,By safe I assume that you mean that you wont get beat up about things.  If you mean safe as in secret protected conversation no it is open to the internet and anyone can see it so if you post personal identifying information it could very well get back to the parties persons that you are talking about.,Infidelity,d9grh9j,1,t5_2raxb
9648656,0,t1_da1osps,It sounds like youre wary of playingup the abusive nature of your relationship with your boyfriend because you dont want to come off as excusing your actions. But please make no mistake you ARE in a precarious and dangerous situation. Regardless of any guilt you may feel and honestly with time I think youll look back on the situation and be able to parse how it all ended from how it would have if not for the element of coercion and fear you need to look after yourself first. Protect your data your person your property get yourself OUT of this relationship first and foremost. If you still feel the need you can tell your ex the whole story from a safe distance. Do not put yourself in harms way or up on a cross on a hostilebias internet forum for that matter for the same outcome end the relationship,Infidelity,da2eams,1,t5_2raxb
9670321,0,t1_da0zmem,Im confused. Why would you direct a woman whos been cheated on by her husband to go to subs that think low of women. They blame women for everything. Are you trying to make her feel like shes the blame or its her fault by having her go there? This is coming from a guy.,Infidelity,da52iyw,6,t5_2raxb
9993543,0,t1_dba6k3s,I didnt even think of what that aspect so thank you for sharing. I dont know if I have any proof other than outright everyone seeing them together and having insiders info so it might not be worth the drama. I feel for her though as she simply has no idea. Thank you again. ,Infidelity,dba6q8i,1,t5_2raxb

10955401,0,t3_5vo9qd,Right after my WW and I started to reconcile a local MARRIED real estate agent started hitting on her via facebook.  She didnt tell me right away but when I found out I took screen shots of his attempts to get my wife to meet him at his office for sex and forwarded them to HIS wife.  Sadly her response was oh no not again I ran into him in person after this and he thanked me for telling his wife and apologized for going after mine.... so at least theres that.,Infidelity,de9yzn4,1,t5_2raxb
11063396,0,t3_5xvdxn,Distance. Distance and time to process everything thats been going on thats what you should do. I recently got dumped a couple of months after our engagement and I worked my ass off trying to get her back. Fast forward a year later shes pregnant and tells me I may have chlamydia and need to get checked but theres no way she couldve became pregnant by any of the other guys. And you can see how manipulative she is from the outside looking in the way I couldnt. I wish you the best and I hope you do talk to someone. Therapy and friends got me through this and theyll get u through this too!!,Infidelity,dem0nxj,1,t5_2raxb
11074925,0,t1_dem1eg7,She may be cheating and thats her decision to make. I do agree that OP should distance himself from her but he needs to tell someone about this even on the slightest chance shes telling the truth. If she is just trying to manipulate him by playing the victim then she will have been called out on it. You seem angry at this woman you dont know and unless you know the parties involved irl then you have no way of knowing what is actually going on.  OP is clearly concerned for her safety. So rather than telling her to fuck off and calling her a dirty whore he can try to make sure shes safe.,Infidelity,denbzoz,1,t5_2raxb
11284033,0,t1_dfayutl,sorry! I added a link. When I created the post it gave me a block to paste the link into which I did I thought it would appear not sure what happened.,Infidelity,dfb117o,1,t5_2raxb
11285189,0,t1_dfb117o,Oh! You can either do text or a link in the post creation thing. If you add text the link disappears. Theyve never made that clear enough. ,Infidelity,dfb5r6d,1,t5_2raxb
11337844,0,t3_61ak0d,I say move on now before it gets worse. People make mistakes but this is systematic lying cheating and extreme narcissism. I kept giving my ex second chances and third chances and fourth chances etc. and in the end she betrayed me and abandoned me when she had planned her escape route. Youd be amazed how easily someone like this can flip a switch and turn on you even if youve been best friends for years and years. Now I truly regret not dumping her to the streets like she deserved when I discovered her lying all those times before instead of continuing to pay for her school medical bills etc. etc.,Infidelity,dfh4ib1,1,t5_2raxb

11791993,0,t3_68894y,Thats what I thought for the longest time. Then I find our that she didnt keep it and had an abortion. She wanted me to believe that she kept it to make me feel guilty about it ,Infidelity,dgwnuki,1,t5_2raxb
