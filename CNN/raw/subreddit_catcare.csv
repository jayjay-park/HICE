1571315,0,t1_cjd04kg,Yeah Ive looked at those kind but havent gotten one. He isnt eating furniture anymore because I got him a big cardboard box and he chews it to bits. Makes a mess for me but its helping with his chewing. I will definitely have to look into the smartcat bootsie combination scratcher wow long name lol. Thank you for the suggestion!,catcare,cjd8ksh,1,t5_2sic2
1576301,0,t3_2cbhkt,Cats are usually pretty sensitive about having their bellies scratched.  Dont expect to be able to do this until youve earned some trust.  Maybe not even then.Its definitely not unusual for a cat to bat you with her paws without using her claws.  And just rubbing her teeth on you instead of biting down hard is also common.These things are kind of a warning that youre getting close to crossing the line.  My suggestion is just to stroke her and play with her in ways that dont elicit these reactions.  That is on the back top of the head maybe.  As you get to know each other better more familiarity might be permitted.  Just a guess on my part but this sounds like a cat that would really enjoy having the fur on her back brushed.As a side note I always chuckle when a cat slightly grazes a persons hand with her teeth and the person shrieks She bit me!These people have never seen a real cat bite.  There was a cantankerous outdoor Siamese that once bit my aunts hand.  The bite went all the way through her hand.So be friendly to your new pal but be respectful too.,catcare,cjdv5m4,3,t5_2sic2
2199017,0,t3_2ka6es,It is so wonderful that not only do you want a cat but you are wanting to do some research before getting one!! Kudos to you!I would recommend getting some cat care books. Or go to your local book store get a few books and a cuppa coffee and read   Will give you a general idea of needs of cats and their care.I also LOVE the My Cat From Hell series on animalplanet. Not only are the episodes entertaining you will learn a LOT to prevent future problems.As with your other pets there are the considerations of what do you do if you go away? What if kitty gets sick? Would you be willing to pay the vet expense and time in caring for a sick friend?  You may also want to explore the potential  allergy problem.  Would be a horror to adopt a kitty you fall in love with but not be able to keep her due to an allergy. You sound like a really responsible person.  Best to you and your possible future feline friend.,catcare,cljcl1a,2,t5_2sic2

Make positive associations with the other cats like them getting fed together at the same time with the door separating them. They will learn to associate the other cat with good things like food.

3282522,0,t1_cp163su,Shes not declawed and with  toes you can imagine how dangerous playing get the finger with her can be.  As for arthritis she moves about the house up onto the couch up her cat tree easily enough for such an enormous cat.  I havent seen a skip in her step yet but at  years its certainly not impossible.  The outside boxes are high sided though due to a chihuahua with a taste for kitty poo.  Now while I dont think its arthritis Haiku is certainly LAZY and the high sides could be the culprit.We tried whole cloves scattered across the area to see if the scent would mask whatever scent is triggering this behavior last night.  But then we had a HUGE thunderstorm and NONE of the animals went outside to do their business last night.  So tonight well try the a cat box with nice low sideson the floor to see if shell use it.I fear my next post will be in rdogcare How do I get my dog to stop eating cat poo?,catcare,cp2fncs,1,t5_2sic2
3374625,0,t1_cpckmdn,Well maybe not Animal Control but I was thinking some animal catcher expert person like Call of the Wildman lol. There has to be some professional or person with expertise that could help you no?Are there any places it could have gotten out to escape? If not if it went in then its still in there but dead or very sick and dying. It probably could have stopped peeing because it has no access to water. Now you have a different problem a carcass in the walls.Sorry Im not much of a help. I just honestly have no idea. Im really interested to hear the outcome though. If the cat didnt escape and its still in there I hope it can get out soon.,catcare,cpcxkg7,1,t5_2sic2
5413056,0,t3_3p5o96,My first thought was a tick but I have no idea how accurate that actually is  you usually can call a vet and ask questions to see if you need to take your cat in maybe try that in the morning. Good luck!,catcare,cw3ks9q,2,t5_2sic2

8425952,0,t1_d5us67z,Hm okay. There arent many chew toys out there it seems. I ordered one that I could find though.,catcare,d5usad4,1,t5_2sic2
9800813,0,t1_dal4bs4,Chances are probably high lol. We bought a pack of five so we can cycle through them as they get stuck or hidden places. Theyre supposed to turn around when they hit a wall and usually do but not always. And he likes to hide things. Im still missing a pair of tweezers he stole months ago. Infodump to follow just brainstorming from my experiences with our hyperactive twoyearold catTheres also some toys that we bought that squeak when hit or bounced. One is a toy mouse and one is a ballcage thing with a toy bird in it. Both soak up a lot of abuse and get a lot of attention. You might also look into the automated toy where its movement under fabric. That can help with redirecting the hunting and pouncing instincts. Were considering getting an overthedoor string toy. The string is covered elastic and has a stuffed or feathery thing at the end so when he pulls on it it doesnt behave in a predictable way. It kinda sounds like yours is struggling with some boredom during the day which we struggle with too. And were working from home all day! We still get love bombed all night though its less attacking and more gonna purr and lay on your face until you love me. Our older cats dont have the same desperation to their needs but our youngest needs lots and lots of brain stimulation and so much energy needs to be burned off...I swear hes more puppy than cat. I like to throw things for him to chase at the top of his tower so he has to climb or drag his fishing pole toy over furniture so he has to jump more. We even invested in an overthedoor cat climber so he has even more things to climb. This puts us at three tower structures for the cats...all of them are used a lot. The vet joked that he must have some Bengal in him somewhere.,catcare,dal5tiu,2,t5_2sic2
