6706726,0,t1_d0d13bj,Not at all. Actually I think Machine Learning as a theory is one of the most popular ones right now. As you said all speculation at this point because we have nothing to go on except only a few facts that could mean many different things.One thing I believe is this channel alternates between computer automatic uploads not performed by any person themselves like these  seconds videos every few seconds continuously  and manual upload These Lock Delock and longer videos.,UnfavorableSemicircle,d0d17ey,1,t5_392ml
6709191,0,t3_47hn2n,For sure.  Videodrome was one of the first films that explored the use of video on video and on society.  There are some elements that could be related especially if one were to believe in any connection to Cicada .

6983400,0,t1_d17tzof,First off yes the WHY? Is killing me as well... Weird person seems IMO very Unlikely because if you can script something to upload to YouTube that many videos AND do it on Twitter as well... Why arent you trying some Person of Interest shit instead of messing with a bunch of people on the Internet... Number  is the fact that if this was pentesting then why continue on Twitter which has far more uploading restrictions? Thought  is that if this was viral marketing you would think that there would be better ways like subliminal messaging social engineering etc. If this was alien how would we know if they actually are? We have had Internet Trolls forever and the like their fake UFO videos and such... The only possibility for me right now is recruitment tool of some sort...

7694658,0,t3_4ko574,I think i may have lost my mind but please follow me on this and dont trash me as this is my first reddit post.The image in Lock looks like the image in Brine to my eyes.  It also looks like a beyblade which is a Japanese toy that my kids played with...doing a bit of searching I found a few things too interesting to pass up. Many of the images of the toy tend to be taken at the same angle as lock. There is always a hexagonal or octagonal bolt in the middle. There is a version called Sagitario which has an emblem of semicircular eyes one of which has an arrow through it.I will try and post a few links below.Apologies in advance if I have broken any protocol here.Again...no idea why he they she it would post a pic of a beyblade but it looked too close not to share.,UnfavorableSemicircle,d3gtzu0,3,t5_392ml
7699209,0,t1_d3haqlt,It looks like either it would be a gradient or another series that will create a complex composite. I am thinking it could create an image with a monochrome dithered color similar to the other one I forgot the name of that created the hexagonal spiral.,UnfavorableSemicircle,d3hcljc,1,t5_392ml
7740412,0,t1_d3lsymt,The frame rate has changed thats for sure. It looks extremely low now. I can check it when I get back home late tonight if no one else does it before then.Might be a lower frame rate because its displaying a lower bit color depth gradient. Fewer colors to show so you might need to enlarge the pixels on this one.Edit  if someone else wants to check just see what the frame rate is on this one and calculate it as a percentage of the frame rate of the other FEND videos which are probably fps then apply the difference to the pixels. So if the older FEND videos are  fps and this is  fps that means this is half speed and the pixels need to be twice as big. See if that fixes the problem. Hopefully it does!,UnfavorableSemicircle,d3m11pl,2,t5_392ml

7976339,0,t3_4ogyhc,Some thoughtsFirst of all these are not only letters and numbers like all the other series. There are definitely words in some of these videos.There seems to be only black and white frames so far which instantly makes me think binary. White  on Black  off. There are only  images per video though and a single byte would need .These videos seem to be fractures of a larger video but sections are missing between them. Some words seem to be cut off but they dont continue at the beginning of the next video. Theyre possibly out of order.Edit Check out DEPTH  Pretty much sums up all my observations in one post.
