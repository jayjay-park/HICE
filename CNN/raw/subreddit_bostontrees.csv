1091514,0,t3_26mbfe,Heyo!  Welcome to Massacheusetts. Home of stuff!How are you? I am also well. So Massachusetts is a Medical Marijuana state meaning if you or or wife or your both get medical recommendations you can find a caregiver and eventually purchase from dispensaries.   Will make the whole situation a lot easier.,bostontrees,chscx36,11,t5_2s8kk
1105025,0,t1_cht8rmd,I guess I just havent heard as much about concentrates being a bigger deal but then again I dont really get into concentrates. Not my style. To each their own though. Ive never heard of someone having more legal issues in Massachusetts due to concentrates.The only legal mumbojumbo I have heard in regards to concentrates all come from out of state and relates to whether a patient needs concentrates or not   I do separate the Medical and Recreational side of the cannabis argument though. I understand that people want to do concentrates and thats totally fine by me. MA is such a liberal state in regards to cannabis anyway that the only time people ever seem to get in trouble for cannabis is either AThey were stupid or Bthey were really stupid.  ,bostontrees,chtwcgx,2,t5_2s8kk

3672481,0,t3_32dogm,My only Kowloons experience was after a high school play in which my two best friends and I played in the pit. The castcrew party was taking place there and after blazing in the parking lot we went in to find that a great majority of the cast had also just partook. Cue the massive buffet house band playing greatest hits covers and us being seated next to a table of postprom girls that gave us all of their food after they admitted that they were too self conscious to eat anything. Such revelry. Actually I have another memory... I was at an EDM concert in Boston with a couple close friends and one quasifriend that was usually up to no good. He ended up taking at least four tabs of acid by himself and becoming so disoriented that he left without telling any of us. As we live a half hour outside of Boston it was our duty to bring the lad home unscathed. Naturally he didnt pick up his phone when we attempted to reach him and spent hours fruitlessly driving the streets of Beantown screaming his name. He eventually called and informed us that he had taken a taxi many miles to Kowloons to blow off some steam. Such a mindfuck. Thanks for the brain blast OP,bostontrees,cqavxlf,4,t5_2s8kk

Which is fine buy you also seem to be bashing other people as well.These PATIENTS without quotes all have different needs most patients do not need extremely strong sativas. Indicas and hybrids tend to be the norm for medicinal uses.gtMe The only strains that are available for  are mediocre and not worth it in my opinion.This is ENTIRELY ON YOU. remember that all cannabis treats people differently just because this strain or that didnt work on YOU doesnt mean it wont for other people This dispensary has what it has because of the DPH they have to grow everything from seed and also because of the DPH they had to receive a special waiver to open early and because of the DPH they have to meet certain standards in terms of mold heavy metal content etc. All the dispensaries are doing the best they can to accommodate the needs of patients you cant call it Constructive Criticism when youre acting like a weed know it all.Now this is one of only  dispensaries in the state and you have said you prefer delivery services. and you said gtDelivery services also tend to have much better strains Sour Diesel Blue Dream Granddaddy Purple Train Wreck Star Killer Super Green Crack. Most of the strains you see at NETA do not exist anywhere else so you cant even research them.Give me one example of how you KNOW these are those strains? Because the service told you? Well thats up to you to trust the service.Some of the strains they have there are offered for as low as OZ. Yes thats still high IMO. However due to supply limitations they cant always offer that amount because they have to be able to supply more patients not just ones that want to get high.I really think you should re read Julie Hollands Pot Book and learn more about why cannabis with Lower thc may effect you in better ways and why high thc doesnt always mean good things.

I highlighted the part where she mentions police COULD do some more.I spoke to Jody Lehrer  a fantastic cannabis lawyer and activist in MA and she wrote this today on Facebookgt Received an interesting question from someone just now regarding possession of cannabis for recreational or adult use purposes in MA lets assume for the sake of argument that a hypothetical buyer is age  or over.The question is whether if such a person buys cannabis knowing as most of us do that no business in MA presently may legally SELL cannabis for recreational adult use purposes might that person be charged with illegal possession?The answer is no  IF the person in possession of the cannabis the buyer is  or over AND the quantity possessed is within the confines of the law e.g. no more than one ounce in public no more than  ounces in that persons primary residence.
