8714486,0,t3_4zdjwb,To have a free will would imply that nothing is influencing our way of thinking and thus our decisions. Which is wrong since we think differently and about different things depending on where we are born which cultures we experienced and how we were treated. I think the illusion of free will and conciousness comes from the fact that we feel like our mind is seperate from the universe but that isnt the case. Since our brains are real physical things they have to obey the laws of nature. So fundamentally the laws of nature will always determine what we think and why we think that. Although all of that doesnt really matter to me because in order to predict someones thoughts you would most likely have to know all quantum states about every single particle in their body and thats literally impossible because of Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle. So who cares if im thinking freely or not if no conscious observer can predict my thoughts. Influence yes predict never.  ,ThisPlace,d6uy5lp,2,t5_3ba6i
