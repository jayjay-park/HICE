3305087,0,t1_cp4llf0,As utusko points out  you actually need to produce something which deserves debate and not some politically driven rightwing narrative. the Society for the Dissemination of Historical Fact is as much of a historical organization as Stormfront. Do not call it as such. They do not publish academic papers. I dont believe the orthodox view of Nanking. The figure of over  people being killed in a city in which the population was only  is ridiculous. There is a difference between the scholarship of Hata Ikuhiko Tokushi Kasahara Masahiro Yamamoto  or even Kitamura Minoru and Itakura Yoshiaki  whos views almost mirror mine to the political and refutted ramblings of Tanaka Masaaki and Higashinakano Shudo. As David Askew point outgtThe notion that rape looting and arson did not occur in and around Nanjing is so absurd that even the most radical corpse mimimisers do not advocate it. Askew  The Contested Past History and Semantics in the Nanjing DebateIt seems hes wrong. Being a nonhistorian does not necessarily invalidate your work. Nonhistorians such as Itakura Yoshiaki have made huge contributions to the Nanking Incident. In fact he even exposed Tanaka Masaakis fabrication of over  of Matsui Iwanes diary entries. With regard to the sources my secondary sources are better than yours. There is no question. My biggest issue with Moteki Hiromichi as well as you is not the sources he used  its the lack of them. I cant address the subject matter when you are producing nothing that can be sufficiently countered. As I said in my original post it takes so much mental gymnastics to come to a conclusion like Moteki Hiromichi that it really doesnt deserve the attention.There are dozens if not hundreds of studies available on the AsiaPacific War. Why is it that youve only managed to produce a short and politically driven essay published by a quasiacademic site and with little sources and citations?,TokyoTrials,cp508j4,1,t5_36dlp
