196475,0,t3_1w2xjc,i actually did this several times in my time in wow and it works well but you do need a pretty decent bank roll to get something like this started. Its not something you can do from the begining and usually it works better at times when an item will be more needed like right after a patch or expansion. I actually had  friends and we would control various server markets like this. Was kind of fun,wildstareconomy,cf0tjhc,2,t5_2zu9r

1295629,0,t3_28wrc0,Ill put things in auction priced low just to get rid of them and open bank space. As long as I get more than vendoring something Ive decided I wont use anyway then Im happy. Fast sell and Im good. If you want to spend the time to mark it up and wait for the sale then good profit to you. ,wildstareconomy,cifdiht,1,t5_2zu9r
