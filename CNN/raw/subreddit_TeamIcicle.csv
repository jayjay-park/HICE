5668065,0,t3_3q1dz6,Hey Im an  year old girl in my second year of college battling major depression. Couldnt tell you if Im winning or not. Im sorry for being put on your team. Or maybe not. My weight and appearance bum me the hell out so Im scraping the bottom of my motivational barrel for this challenge. My MFP username is bizmo although I dont use it very much anymore. Maybe Ill start again. Ive never really had a supportive group and I dont know what to expect. But Im competitive as hell so lets crush this. ,TeamIcicle,cwzogdr,2,t5_3agif

5730446,0,t1_cx72ton,umelodieriver pretty much nailed it. Sorry to hear youre going through this. I agree that the best possible way to deal with it is to focus your energy on something else the gym is great. Plus as she points out youll feel great and look great soon. Then honestly the number of potential new girlfriends will increase significantly. I know that doesnt help if you want this girlfriend but sometimes unfortunately these things happen.  ,TeamIcicle,cx7f1sr,1,t5_3agif
