161688,0,t3_1vq4an,I started small and got  Chauvet colorPallette LED lights. Also got  O ring clamps so they fit right on my speaker poles. I turn the settings on beat pulse so the lights change w the bass beat. Then I got a  redgreen laser which is a nice simple fill. I dont like light trees and its just me so I want light compact systems. My future purchase will be an up light system of  lights but thats a ways off and about . ,mobileDJ,cewukvh,1,t5_2wz8c
876507,0,t1_ch35jn5,Sometimes i go for a walk around the party to get food and ill listen in on what the adults are saying.  times out of  i hear them dropping the F bomb like there is no tomorrow and their kids are right next to them. Normally i take that as that they dont care that i play explicit music.,mobileDJ,ch3wvae,3,t5_2wz8c
908054,0,t3_24i5xc,I have a pair of ZLXs and they sound EXTREMELY similar to QSC Ks. I also have a buddy with QSC Ks and those sound EXTREMELY similar to QSC KW. Sooooo... The ZLXs sound EXTREMELY similar to QSC KWs in my opinion. The QSCs definitely do not sound hundreds and hundreds of dollars better than the ZLXs and you dont need ridiculous amounts of volume for that size party. I intend to pick up another pair of ZLXs maybe even two more pairs.As for the behringer subs I also have a pair of those. Ive heard them next to JBL PRXXLF as well as next to QSC HPRi. The behringer subs are quieter than both the JBL and the QSCs but they get allllmooossst as low as the JBLs. They just sound more rough. But I really wouldnt say that the JBLs or QSCs sound like theyre worth hundreds and hundreds of dollars more than the Behringers. I know behringer has a lousy reputation but the BD is really something they got right.,mobileDJ,ch7i2cf,0,t5_2wz8c

Plus you can just image a new harddrive and swap it in and out of your pre existing laptop leaving your personal hard drive in tact and away from catastrophic failure. The gf might be mad if here selfies were deleted.,mobileDJ,chg60gy,5,t5_2wz8c
1206093,0,t1_ci56uv1,If I were you Id probably just stick with Intro and turn up the EQs if you need more volume and if you want to get back into it and have a bit more of a professional kit upgrade the entire controller rather than drop more money on DJ...Would also help to get an additional mixer like a mackie or soundcraft to slot between the controller and the speakers to get an additional gain stage.,mobileDJ,ci5ay1g,1,t5_2wz8c

10464287,0,t3_5pqr5k,Aside from many of the good ones already listed I always get a good response from Boogie Shoes  KC amp The Sunshine Band.  Although I havent played it in a while Come On EileenDexys Midnight Runners used to go pretty well next to Brown Eyed Girl.  Also try the Jimmy Buffet version of Brown Eyed Girl to mix it up.  ,mobileDJ,dcu8erq,3,t5_2wz8c
11474032,0,t3_6285g0,It sounds like you have identified a business opportunity.  DJ equipment is simply electronic components.  If you really want a career in repairing the gear get a degree as an electrical engineer.  If this isnt a career aspiration but rather a DIY endeavor to save money then Im sure you can find howto videos circuit explanations etc online that you can learn from.  Prepare to burn up a fair amount of gear before you get it figured out.  I would recommend buying broken gear on the cheap and practice fixing it to start.  Components should be easy to source relays switches etc but printed circuit boards are likely proprietary and you will have to go to the specific company for those. if theyll even sell them to a nondealer  DJSoo is correct as usual youll void any warranty if you crack open a case.  ,mobileDJ,dfwkrtl,1,t5_2wz8c
