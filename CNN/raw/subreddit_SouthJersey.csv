As for bars the Main Street bar in Voorhees is a bit hard to find but has some pretty good food. Dubh Linn Square in Cherry Hill right across from the Voorhees Middle School is a bit on the pricey side but has a sweet selection of draft brews and a pretty nice place to chill at.

Moorestown is super close to Mount Laurel  Cherry Hill is basically split into two sides  east and west. The east side is very close to Mount Laurel the west not as much but still very easy to commute from. Haddonfield is a little further but still not a bad commute.
