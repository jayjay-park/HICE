Not all profs know if theyll have the same grad students or more the following year to help you out so they are a little hesitant to immediately take students. Some profs choose their students after early January the pickier profs.  Most I found were full after midFeb or so. Hence youre not late just yet but youre not early either.

3302073,0,t1_cp4iaab,Im aware that transcripts will be promptly mailed when they are made available the problem is with regards to when they will be made available. For example lets say my graduation is pushed back one month due to the strike. That would lead to my final transcripts being made available to graduate programs one month past when they were supposed to be made available and possibly PAST the final deadline which would screw me. I agree that my situation is optimistic considering Schulich Graduate Admissions will be understanding of the situation but I have friends who will not be so lucky some of whom will lose job offers and acceptance offers if graduation is postponed by as much as a month.I disagree with you on your second point because I believe all education should be an investment. This idea certainly is not unique to Schulich as I think most people go to university and take on debt with the hope of getting a job afterwards. Rather the more unique circumstance in my mind is people who educate themselves even when there is no financial reason to do so. Im sorry if this comes out rude but I dont think theres any luster logic or any other positive spin on spending a huge amount of money on something that wont give you a return e.g.. a PHD in philosophy. When you spend money to learn something you dont need to know youre spending money on CONSUMPTION. This is the crux of Yorks problem many students are going into debt to FUND CONSUMPTION. If CUPEs wages are increased past the fair market wage likely what theyre making now we would in essence be redistributing wealth to fund the consumption of these people.That being said if someone really likes philosophy and wants to get a PHD go wild. But when that person realizes that there are no jobs out there for Philosophy PHDs that by getting their degree they made themselves poorer i.e. lownegative return on investment and the only place they can work is as a TA at a University they better not strike and ruin the lives of others because theyre unhappy with the life that THEIR decisions brought them.,yorku,cp4nvlv,2,t5_2s8jd

3353869,0,t1_cpajlie,In my opinion the recognition of LGBTQ equity language alone is enough let alone tuition indexation. It speaks to a deeper problem with Yorks administration that we are in a situation to address. Nevertheless Im not in the we have York by the balls camp personally. I want a swift resolution more than anything right now. I apologize if I seemed insensitive to your very legitimate concerns but I do feel that you are missing my point if York is refusing us fair tuition indexation which is already in our contract theyve simply found a way to undermine it and giving it to us would cost them nothing why are we to be held responsible for continuing the strike? Weve made it clear that tuition indexation and equity language are our two major sticking points and that they are all that are needed to end this strike. If Im being honest despite the best intentions of some of our members I dont even think York would need to budge on the equity language given their me too clause. So why is it the union upon whom you are calling to back down when York has it within their power to end the strike today by bending on the tuition indexation? I think theyve successfully created a climate in which the union assumes responsibility in many minds.

3391315,0,t1_cpdtc32,I am a York MSW grad. The things to remember is that UofT MSW is unfunded and Ryerson MSW isnt open to those without a BSW. If funding isnt a consideration then its important to consider what type of social work you want to engage with. Theres some clear differences between the schools. UofT has a tendency to focus on clinical social work to the point where I have known students take issue with their lack of critical understanding and PhD students refuse to take courses within the department. York and to a lesser extent Ryerson has a much bigger focus on Critical Social Work.

3482383,0,t1_cpp7co5,gtThere are limited government resources. Some of which go to ODSP and Ontario Works. Others go to things like funding York and by proxy funding CUPE . Other resources go to other things as well. But they are limited! So when you add more resources to one thing such as giving more money to York to resolve CUPEs issues it has to be taken from somewhere else. The majority of Yorks revenue comes from tuition specifically undergrad tuition and York posted over  million in surplus last year for example.  If you want to make this argument then  is happy to support you and again if you have been reading the news and commentaries aroudn these strikes you should know this.  and  demands are less about asking the province for more money to fund YorkUofT what they are pointing to is how the revenue generated by these institutions is used such as the president of York making  per year on top of other benefits. These strikes make a direct comparison between York and UofTs claim that they have no money with the massive and disproportionate salaries of their administrators which make up a significant portion of their expenses and they continue to receive disproportionate raises every year while the  to student ration decreases and the teacher to student ration decreases.  and  members who are responsible for about  of the teaching at these universities only represent between  of the universities operating budgets. So the money you say could be better spent elsewhere CUPE would agree but it is not CUPE taking this money. UofT is posting record surpluses yet TAs have not even seen a cost of living raise in over  years while the salaries of administrators have ballooned disproportionately in comparison to any other sector while less and less is invested in actual teaching and education in those very universities. So yes there is a problem and funds could be distributed more effectively but again I urge you to go inform yourself about the realities of the ways these universities work the way they distribute their revenue and then come back and tell me CUPE is to blame. CUPEs fight is using these exact same arguments you are making that the university is not effectively spending the resources it has and needs to distribute them more effectively.,yorku,cpp7toh,3,t5_2s8jd

If you end up not being able to transfer and are in a situation where attendance counts towards participation marks you might end up losing points for those weeks you were in the other tutorial. If you want to do this I would definitely talk to the prof about it first. Theyll be in a better position to let you know what to do and how to apply for a transfer in a way that might minimize risk to your performance in the class. That would be my number one recommendation. However if someone decides to just go at it and sit in on another tutorial in hopes of transferring then at the very least talk to the TA about it even though theyll probably just tell you to talk to the prof about it.  I guess the short answer to your question is that while I dont necessarily recommend doing this if you do just make sure that you talk to the prof andor the TA before you decide to go ahead with sitting in another tutorial. Just make sure that all of your bases are covered.,yorku,ctu6o89,1,t5_2s8jd

Yeah sometimes we get security bulletins about assaults or robberies that happen in the Village but there have probably been only a handful that actually happened within the confines of the Village in the past year or two.  York has such a bad rep because any kind of crime that happens within a km radius of the school gets labeled as a York University crime. Yes people should be mindful about their surroundings when theyre walking anywhere around campus but the same goes for anywhere around Toronto in general. Ive never had a problem anywhere around York and I frequently walked across the Village multiple times per daynight over the past  years to visit my girlfriend on the other side of the village. Most of those times I had headphones in and was reading my phone the whole time.Stop instilling so much fear into anyone potentially living in the Village and to anyone who is considering living in the village dont listen to this crackpot.,yorku,d19j7uu,10,t5_2s8jd

So while a Schulich class might give out  As a BAS class will only have  As regardless of how many people objectively deserve an A.That being said Schulich students are obviously keener and more likely to get high marks than BAS students so the higher curve makes sense.,yorku,d1v5iq3,2,t5_2s8jd
7197702,0,t1_d1vsswz,Ive always been a that kind of person who people would open up to as a child and as a teenager and helping people validated me. And then in university when I became a don in a residence I worked one on one with many of my students for many of their issues mental health sexual assault eating disorders etc etc. I found that so very fulfilling and meaningful.I was initially on the road to law but after this job I realized that might not be for me. Alongside this job my political activism got me thinking about antioppression and different peoples lived realities.  So Ive been taking courses mostly about development inequality or behaviour in psychology. Ive also been working a bit in research and communications! I started thinking about what I wanted to do and thats when I found the MeD program at UofT and I loved it. Then I spoke to a bunch of people who started getting me thinking about social work I had never thought about it before.The programs looked great because it seemed like it would be studying and learning while also working. Im kind of getting really tired of all these theories in my undergrad that are just theories and critiques of theories. So Ive just been giving a lot of thought into what I would like to do! I definitely do want to study further but in something a little more applied.I would love to work in any Universitys counselling clinic working with students one on one. Or perhaps in a hospital although I dont completely know what that would be like.  However amongst all my support work and activism friends burn out is super real. So I felt I must ask you that question! Thats why I realize Id like to do a job in a controlled setting like  to  it cant be one where I take it home with me or am on call...Ive found thats not very good for my mental health.
