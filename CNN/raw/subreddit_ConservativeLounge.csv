Itd be better for the conservative movement to keep the few important voices we have in the Legislative and get someone else for the Court.Id be most happy with Willettgt In a  interview Willett stated Our Constitution exists to secure individual freedom the essential condition of human flourishing.  Liberty is not provided by government liberty preexists government. Its our natural birthright not a gift from the sovereign. Our founders upended things and divided power to enshrine a promise not a process.Or Judge Napolitano but thats unlikely although less unlikely than Donald Trump becoming presidentgtAll presidents but Jefferson have argued that their first job was to keep us safe. All presidents but Jefferson were wrong. If you read the Constitution you will see that the Presidents first job  as Jefferson understood well  is to keep us free.,ConservativeLounge,d9tqwri,2,t5_3gxi6

9671825,0,t1_da57x9l,The Prager University video on it he claims hes not attacking Unions but showing what adverse affect they have on the education system. And I  agree but the problems he associates with teacher unions are the same problems affecting public unions across this country. This is why I was excited to see Scott Walker in our primary as I was hoping he would lead a national effort to reform public unions so that arent such a toxic drain on our society. He was my first pick because of the reforms we saw him do in Wisconsin while at the same time he was able to take on the Teacher Unions and the Democratic party.Teacher unions are horribly corrupt in California where I live. When proposition  was being battled reaffirming the definition of marriage since the courts kept over turning it Teach Unions spent tens of millions of dollars battling it. It had nothing to do with its designated members or their interests it was ludicrous and no one batted an eye lash on the fact that the Teacher Union was acting as a political arm of the Democratic party. They throw money at nearly every major democratic policy or program and throw money against any type of reform. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger attempted reform but the Unions rolled out hundreds of millions of dollars and utterly destroyed him in a public initiative battle. He acted like a whipped dog after that which is why we all consider him a super moderate Republican.Had the Scalia not died and that SCOTUS decision had gone through you would see a significant shift in the state in terms of how left leaning it is. The Teach Unions are that powerful on public policy. I dont know the Constitutional basis for striking it down as I havent researched the topic at all I just know that stopping the law mandated money flow to teacher unions would go a long way to balancing the political power in the state.We could have a whole post dedicated to public unions and their negative affect on the country. So I wont take this into too much of a tangent. But these old corrupt Democratic institutions need to go.,ConservativeLounge,da59748,3,t5_3gxi6

The goal of libertarianism is to reduce the amount of force that can be imposed involuntarily on another person to as little as possible.  We want to reduce or eliminate government a sentiment I think most here could and would agree with to some extent.,ConservativeLounge,dcin9k5,2,t5_3gxi6

In this case they are attempting to crush the global economy which ultimately leads to more poverty. Impoverished people care less about environmental impacts and are more likely to burn anything to stay warm. Environmentalism is a luxury of first world countries.,ConservativeLounge,dgo7qx5,5,t5_3gxi6
