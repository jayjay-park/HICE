It would be a sculpture or a bowl or whatever. And you could keep fingering it forever and it wouldnt necessarily be more finished or better. It is just up to you to decide when that piece of clay is something. Thats sort of how it is with me. Ill start working on a song and in a couple hours its a song it can be listened to.

4265314,0,t1_cs68rok,Agree wholeheartedly. Im not sure why this post is being downvoted. Well no I understand but I think its stupid to do so.I feel like every time an artist releases something new after a while we all have this underlying feeling of dread because were afraid we wont like it and then well have to contend with the idea that maybe weve outgrown the band or the band has moved in a different direction. Then when new stuff comes out its a confirmation bias because part of us expects it to be a disappointment. Not that its impossible to just not think Currents is going to be that good but I dont think the tracks released so far would cause such widespread panic and worry if they had been on other albums like you said.I was really really surprised that Cause Im A Man seems to be the most disappointing track for those who arent satisfied with the recent releases in this community. To me its the one that feels the most like classic Tame or at least in the vein of FLWOGB  its so spacey and has so many layers while still having that poppy sensibility that KP is clearly going for according to interviews. I wasnt entirely satisfied with Let It Happen on the first listen but its grown on me. Disciples and Eventually are really good too. Definitely not my favorite Tame tracks but I think thats just because well what are the chances that the most recent thing an artist releases is going to be your favorite thing?,TameImpala,cs6f3bv,1,t5_2t1l9

Currents is a great album  sounds really unique and was created very skilfully  but I still think Lonerism is a better product overall. ,TameImpala,csy2y51,2,t5_2t1l9

4541526,0,t3_3d9abn,A mostly fair review and I can agree with almost all of it except the complaint about the vocals. Pretty much every song in all their albums has the nasally falsetto vocals and it seems kinda weird that he didnt mind it on the previous  albums but complained about it getting overbearing on this one. Regardless I can agree with the issue of the last track fading away which I wasnt a huge fan of and can understand why past life isnt everyones piece of cake.,TameImpala,ct335tl,4,t5_2t1l9

4548174,0,t1_ct2nteq,Hi Comiclover sorry for the delay. Here are the original concepts and very rough sketches. True Orbit of the Planets based on skewed perception of the planets in the Solar System orbiting the Sun in concentric circles when in reality the Sun itself is orbiting a larger body at relatively incredible speeds.   !!! documenting of trails of planet bodies with a centred Sunstar. importance of composition centred Sun streaming planets around.  glowing stars on black background ?. image would be D still representation of three dimensional movement of the Solar System Currents.Sketch . Manipulation of Wave Forms based on this image  horizontal lines can be transformed into streaming wave forms. the manipulation of line weights can draw an image into the forms. The face in the example can be replaced with appropriate imagery for Currents a silhouette hands a sphere etc. change in line weight can be subtle therefore creating subtle image.Sketch . Wave forms create literal image a finished example of this is in the main link currents literally wrap object as it moves through space. in the example below the object is a human moving forward the streams suggest the movement they are making as they navigate.Sketch . Geometry currents trace main geometric body where orbit of celestial objects is apparent. Further currents wave forms and arrays are created from the energy of the main bodySketch . Cosmic Starry Night perspective from ground shows immense scale of currentsSketches  variation current gradient variation,TameImpala,ct3x79n,1,t5_2t1l9

An electric current is a flow of electric charge. In electric circuits this charge is often carried by moving electrons in a wire. It can also be carried by ions in an electrolyte or by both ions and electrons such as in a plasma.Its a roll of the dice as to which you get.
