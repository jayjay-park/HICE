2434658,0,t3_2nagka,I find that it helps me the most when I get some food like  hours before the test so your not still full but not going to get hungry until after the test and kind of do some study while eating to review ports and acronyms the. I just relax for like the last  minutes before the test.,ccent,cmcmoih,1,t5_2t90w
2754246,0,t3_2rjkoz,Congrats dude. I had an OSPF troubleshooting simlet and knowing the show commands for OPSF really helped. howpass.com was a great study source for me. I never tried measureup.com how does it compare to howpass.com? ,ccent,cnh59pg,1,t5_2t90w

2882950,0,t3_2t2bue,I might edit this as you read it...Im guessing the formatting will be all fucked up                                                                                                                         Actually nm the formatting..thats close enough irl line everything up in  columns...But heres a suggestions...write it  times... that way you dont have to erase and possibly smear the ink. I did it with only writing it out once...but knowing what I know now I would have written it out more times because theres a shitload of subnetting to be done. And thats all you need the whiteboard for.,ccent,cnvslhu,1,t5_2t90w
3729492,0,t1_cq0rpiy,Not sure I agree with that. In the official cert guide there are  pages on the topic. Doesnt seem like a big emphasis to me. ,ccent,cqhdx7m,0,t5_2t90w
3750704,0,t3_33676h,If you cant get your hands on actual Cisco IOS image files use Packet Tracer. My networking teacher who is CCNP certified created some challenging packet tracers. My teachers custom packet tracers and their task lists.  A link I found in the CCNA subreddit with Packet Tracer itself and activities for download. There are simulations on all the Cisco certs. According to my networking teacher they are weighted heavily if you flunk one and still get everything else  on the test right youll still flunk the test.Good luck in pursuing Cisco Certs! ,ccent,cqjt110,3,t5_2t90w
4473931,0,t1_cstv7zi,To belabor the obvious or perhaps not so obvious what NAT does is allow every major ISP or company to use private IP address space .x.x.x ..x.x or ...x instead of sucking up real ip addresses for packets that dont need to be routed across the Internet. When a packet has to go outside and talk to someone else outside that corporationISP it gets an alias that is routable and keeps that alias for the length of the transaction. Depending on how you have the translation set up that alias might be temporary or it might be permanent. ,ccent,csulzx5,4,t5_2t90w

5141714,0,t1_cv5nt90,I second Todd lammles book. Check out Chris bryants ccna series on udemy. If you can afford it cbt nuggets. They explain everything from the ground level up.especially their subnetting series. ,ccent,cv5ro84,1,t5_2t90w

5564320,0,t3_3rbeuz,Router interfaces arent like the interfaces on a switch. In this case like the other person mentioned youd need to set up another network if you want to connect through the router then the router would do its job and route traffic between networks. ,ccent,cwmsyuo,1,t5_2t90w

8305864,0,t1_d5dzrlu,Make sure you know how to subnet and how to choose subnet masks based on a set of requirements. Additionally make sure you carefully read the questions. If you simply skim through them more than one answer will seem correct.As far as most common topic it varies. Cisco has a huge question bank that the exam pulls from so it is different for everybody.,ccent,d5fsg1h,3,t5_2t90w

8647087,0,t1_d6mh2u7,That was the impression I got as well. Does the ICND v have an extended bit on security? They also have questions relating to DoS attacks and IP spoofing which is covered but only in mentioning without going into detail,ccent,d6mhwwz,1,t5_2t90w
9083076,0,t3_54olic,Had this idea for a game I wrote up the other day.  Its a puzzle game to learn quick conversions between binary decimal and hexadecimal.  If Im on the right track I thought about add some more features which basically all revolve around the same core mechanic having to quickly compare multiple numbers that are in different number systemsRight now there are only  predefined levels to get started but then when you hit level six it will infinetly generate random levels.Just FYI The randomly generated levels should never take more than  turns.  ,ccent,d83mz8s,3,t5_2t90w

9654792,0,t1_d9ke8bl,Looking over my notes and came back here and was curious about another thing haha. I get that WAN coming in was able to work with T or E. Coming into your CSUDSU were those RJ? Those supported . Mbps or . However you said Ethernet was used on LAN at  Mbps. How was this possible if the most you were getting into the router was . or ?Sorry for so many questions man! This picture explains my question though! Picture,ccent,da35k2n,1,t5_2t90w
