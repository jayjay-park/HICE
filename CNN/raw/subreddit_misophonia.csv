287174,0,t3_1xdzmc,Im actually about to let my lease expire because one of my neighbors a few times a day knocks something around hard enough to rattle my light fixtures.  Its unpredictable and it happens at all hours.  Ive asked my neighbors when I see them in the hall because Im not actively being triggered and I can talk about it semicalmly but nobodys owned up to anything.  Apart from camping out in the hallway and waiting for the thud I just have to deal with it and thats not working.  After about a dozen complaints over three months management dealt with one constantlybarking dog by telling me the owner was moving so Im not expecting much there.Youve already talked to your neighbor theyve had the chance to adjust and decided not to.  I think BasilFaultys point is probably your best bet especially about calling the landlord.  Leave voicemails if you have to.  Hi Landlord just calling to report this noise problem again.  Its ltdate and timegt Im in the far end of my apartment right.  This is how loud my neighbors are playing the music.,misophonia,cfaj2wc,2,t5_2sd5e

I just found out about misophonia last month. Ive told my girlfriend and she had been really awesome trying not to eat chips in the car or while we are watching movies etc.I have been battling this for over  years now and its something that will not go away as far as I have researched. I hope things get better for you.  Try sitting down with your roommate and talking to him.  Maybe show him an article on misophonia so he understands exactly what you are going thru. And if after he still gives no fucks then I would strongly consider getting a new roommate or getting a place alone.Good luck!Edit spelling,misophonia,cfnvl6l,3,t5_2sd5e

He is always sat right next to me and every annoying noise makes me wish I could murder him.Its not so bad during the week. My PA is my employee I pay her wages. If she pisses me off its not good for her. I can happily tell her to shut the fuck up each and every time she triggers me.I cant do that with my husband though. He just gets mad at me and says its his house too and that this is the only place where he can do that kind of thing without being judged.He does try to curb his annoying habits when he spots me glaring at him but he doesnt see why he should have to stop them entirely. I understand his point but he doesnt seem to realise that it makes me hate him.There is no reason to sniff constantly. Blow your fucking nose and shut the fuck up!! There is no reason to whistle when he knows its like a knife in my brain. If youre happy fine just dont make others miserable with it!If my PA can control herself around me why cant he?

Now place that sound in your ear. No not just so you can hear it but IN your ear as if it WERE your ear. Now take that same noise and put it in your head. Now turn up the volume till you not only hear it but you feel it. Now keep turning that sound up until it fills every single bit of your existence. Until its jampacked inside of you  times bigger than you but still stuffed inside of you ripping you apart at the seams. Every nuance of that sound ripples throughout your thoughts making you willing to do almost anything to stop that unbearable sound inside your own head. In that moment you disappear and become nothing but that horrible noise magnified to encompass all of your existence.If its just a quick ask or explanation of why Im wearing headphones or earplugs itd be something likegtIve got a medical condition that can make me oversensitive to noises sometimes.OrgtIve got a brain disorder that makes me hypersensitive to certain noises. ,misophonia,cgq3j3q,6,t5_2sd5e

That way I can still hear enough to participate in conversations but most of the eating sounds are blocked. Since we dont know how the seating arrangements will be in advance I keep my earplugs in my pocket or purse where they always are just in case until we get there then go into the bathroom sometime before the food comes and put it in while Im in there. Then no one even has to know Im wearing it since my hair is long enough to cover my ears which especially helps if there are other people there who I dont want to have to explain myself to my immediate family knows about my misophonia but other relatives dont.,misophonia,cn4vto5,3,t5_2sd5e
2830735,0,t3_2sil3c,I dont know what  if anything  theyll try and give her. I take certain drugs that help me cope with anxiety in many situations and calm me down and let me try and stop panic attacks. Its a class of drugs called benzodiazepines or benzos which include things like Valium and Xanax which you have probably heard of. They definitely do have a calming effect. I really doubt these would stop her issues though. I cant fucking stand the sound of people eating and nothings gonna change that. Luckily Im from a family who never had family meals but my mum seemed rather bothered for a while that I always insisted on eating alone. Theres gonna have to be a compromise somewhere. It just looks selfish to me that theyre trying to put her on drugs in order to make her conform and keep them happy. Again I have no idea if these are the type of meds she would be put on but its the only thing I know of that has a strong calming effect. They can also be addictive. Not necessarily in the same manner as other infamous recreational drugs where you crave like mad and will do anything for a hit but I notice that I get symptoms when I dont take them. As someone whos had massive anxiety issues for a lifetime and cant get these legally from a doctor Im in the UK  apparently the US will give all sorts of dangerous pills to just about anyone I dont feel that its a good attempt at a solution. ,misophonia,cnpully,4,t5_2sd5e

2933167,0,t3_2tfvte,I see it as the neurons that process these specific sounds have been attached to the emotional pathways of rage disgust and sadness.

This sub has regrettably become a haven for that sort of thing.Ive been into the misophonia zeitgeist for a while now and honestly do not know if people ever truly get over misophonia. I personally am trying to fight my way out of it and its a bitch. It can get seriously detrimental to ones life and relationships. Try and prepare yourself for the possibility that it will seriously alterhinder her life growth relationships et cetera.I dont have kids but one thing I always wished was that my family would try to see past my intense reactions and try not to take them so personally. That is a lot to ask but its a seriously convoluted condition. Your daughter is probably accumulating just as much emotional stress as everyone else from this and theres a good chance its being compounded by all the isolation anger anxiety and what not. Im not wellversed on outlets that help abate those symptoms but if you can find some by all means push for them. That and keeping ones life in order outside the disorder wherever possible is hugely important.It would be good to have her see a behavioral therapist. If you can find one who has some specialization in this great but I dont know how prevalent specialists are. Talk to the therapist ahead of time. Let them know that she has note most of whats out there is still largely speculation a learned disorder whereby her brain processes sound in such a way that produces a fightflight response. In my experience even talking about it with friends has been quite helpful so even talking to a professional in general would probably help a lot.I hope this doesnt impact her and everyone elses lives too much.

4740893,0,t3_3ftcav,Xanax is a drug in the class called benzodiazepines which are drugs that act on the same protein receptors in your brain that are also activated by alcohol. There are some subtleties to their differences but being on benzodiazepines is similar to drinking alcohol. If you go that route you should make sure youre always being safe as far as driving goes.Alternatively you might consider asking your psychiatrist if SSRIs have been shown to be helpful in this condition. Likely there are no studies to evaluate them in the treatment of misophonia  but SSRIs can be really helpful in providing a more stable response to a variety of mood disorders including anxiety and depression.Im not a psychiatrist so take what I say with a grain of salt but I just want you to be aware that benzodiazepines like xanax are not a cure but more of a cheap bandaid for the problem.,misophonia,cts4u3k,1,t5_2sd5e

I usually wouldnt blast my music if others can hear it because its a jerk thing to do when others do it they are being jerks same thing.I can comfort myself with ideas of these noises are necessary e.g. construction work or these people dont realize theyre being disturbing but those thoughts are usually accompanied by me leaving the area.

I have earphones in and that usually does the trick for me and I can leave it at that. Seeing people eat is a problem as well but thankfully Im not in that situation a ton so I just deal with it when it happens.Animals on the other hand. I cannot stand to hear see or feel animals eatinglickingchewing. It shoots me straight to a  on the scale and makes me want to hurt them. I obviously wouldnt ever hurt an animal but if my cat is sitting on my knee and she starts to lick I will usually start shakingcrying and I throw a lightweight blanket over her so she is restricted and cannot lick herself and that usually makes her fell asleep.If this is happening why she is on my bed I will hallucinate the sound for hours after she has stopped. While she is licking and I can feel it I usually need to get out of bed and pace my room while violently shaking and sobbing this usually goes for  minutes or so and then when she is finally finished I can get back into bed. Thats when the hallucination comes in even if Im listing to music I will still imagine that I can hear the noise sometimes I even imagine the noise is part of the music.I have tried to leave the room while this is happening but she will just get up and try and follow me and then she ends up stopping wherever I go to and she continues to lick so its no point really trying to get away from it the best I can do it get away from feeling the movement.,misophonia,d80wou1,3,t5_2sd5e

9572737,0,t1_d9sziea,All the recommendations are just from what I have experienced being around dogs. I have the same sort of triggers as you in terms of dogs so I thought I would give my experiences in what dogs I try avoid it could be different with you!I think German Shepards are very pretty. I havent met many in person but I dont think they have a slober problem or anything. The biggest problem would be the panting after exercising the dog I guess it would be easy to avoid and probably one of the easier things to deal with aside from the eating. We dont walk our dogs that much they are pretty small and we have a massive backyard that we play with them and throw their toys and I always find they need to stay outside an extra  minutes or so to calm down and stop panting. It would be easy enough to do that with a German as well I guess. We put our dogs outside while we are eating and while my dad is at work and they are fine by themselves but I would never leave them outside permanently. We feed the staffy outside and my  maltese dogs inside the staffy is a piggy and try to steal their food but they are always away from me so I dont hear them eating thank goodness!I have a bit of a problem with my staffy snoring it isnt super extreme or anything. I will either leave the room or put my earphones on. His bed is on the other side of the room so I can sometimes tune it out by watching the TV depending on how loud he is being. The biggest problem is his snorts. They call them pig dogs for a reason and my goodness his snorting. He basically sounds identical to a pig sometimes. He only really snorts when he is excited so it isnt super hard to deal with but its definitely triggering. He also loves licking his paws if they get wet. I have never seen it before with any other dog but the vet said its nothing to worry about. If he licks his paws I will call him over to pet him and distract him and he usually forgets about it. Honestly I find my cat grooms more than my dogs. I have  dogs  maltese and my staffy and I very rarely get triggered by them. The biggest problem is eating and drinking and the occasional licking. I find my maltese dogs very rarely lick since they have so much fur but Im not sure if thats normal for all long haired dogs.If your boyfriend isnt going to budge maybe try compromise by suggesting a foster program first. That way you can try get a dog without a ton of commitments of adoptingbuying straight away most places here in Aus anyway will take the dog back if it doesnt suit you and they find a different foster home. That way you can trial a dog and see how it goes for you and if it doesnt work out they can find another foster carer but if it does work out you might decide to get a dog of your own. You can even try different types of dogs in terms of coat lengthactivity level and see if that changes anything. I know how hard it is good luck!,misophonia,d9t19wj,1,t5_2sd5e

I knew I wouldnt be able to leave the room as easily for those couple of weeks to keep my sanity. It eventually morphed into despising my mother and order sister when theyd chew.I was physically abused by my father that stopped at . We left our church. Religion does fucked up shit to families. I was molested as a child. As years have passed it got worse when I was raped in high school.

I wouldnt say I have a healthy relationship with sex either.I also suffer from anorexia and purging. ,misophonia,dc06wsd,2,t5_2sd5e
10235018,0,t1_dc3rhxu,Kiddo this guy is right. Your mom sounds like a narcissist and I know because mine was too I too have misophonia and I too was scolded for it. Im so sorry you are going through this. One day you wont live with them and you wont have to put up with their crap anymore and they will have to treat you like a human if they want you around. When you have time try and listen to the sound of people eating on Youtube with white noise over it do this for a couple of seconds and do this every day until you build up your tolerance. I know it sucks. You arent in the wrong at all I hope youre ok.,misophonia,dc47331,4,t5_2sd5e
10340790,0,t3_5lkkdp,My coping method with mesophonia and anything really is to just not think about itblame it. Ive just accepted my fate know ok I have it oh no and just dont overthink its existence and ever sense I stopped thinking about it I can say it has gotten easier. I remember reading somewhere that the brain doesnt ignore the sounds like it normally should and causes eating and such being a problem and not thinking about it has helped my brain ignore those sounds a bit better. Not an end all solution by any means but its better then how I used to be.,misophonia,dcg6rbv,1,t5_2sd5e

10510750,0,t3_5p1deo,I was put on zoloft when I was  or so for anxiety I think. Ive been on a few different anti depressants since then. I dont think being on the drugs affected me negatively and that was much younger than you. But I think there is now much more criticism about prescribing drugs to children. But to your actual question  none of the antidepressants Ive been on have ever helped my misophonia and I havent seen too many accounts of other people having them work for this either.,misophonia,dczi71w,1,t5_2sd5e

10916505,0,t3_5vxlhz,It doesnt help that much. Maybe slightly but its really not worth the side effects of physical dependence youd get from taking it daily if you end up taking it that frequently. My ex convinced me I was too crazy when I didnt take Xanax so I fell into the habit of taking it every day for . years. Now Im trying to taper down to zero and battling horrible withdrawal symptoms. This medication is just not safe for longterm use. Please be careful. ,misophonia,de5yl01,6,t5_2sd5e

11122064,0,t3_5xaojk,When I was a kid I used to flip my plate with food on it and rage quit the table. When I was a teenager I yelled at people in then canteen or even I class to the ones chewing gum. It is actually forbidden to wear hats chew gums eat and during in class where I live as its considered impolite because it fn is. So I often reported my classmates to the teacher. When I was a young man Ive dumped girlfriends because of their noises especially mouth and stomach sounds. They could not believe me thought I was cheating or not loving them. As a man in my midthirties I have organized my life to have less human contacts as possible always wear headphones avoid public transportation found a good spot at work bought an isolated house have a limited social life only with people I trust. But once in a while I have to... take the metro I switch to another metro if Im in a bad spot take the train for long trips ask people who eat to go to the bar. Ask people who use their phone to go to the platform pointing my index at the no phone stickers  go to the cinema to please my gf I wear earbuds and I chose the seats. If things go south we have to change seats  on my motorcycle i yell at people. Makes no difference usually they dont notice but damn it feels good,misophonia,desodog,1,t5_2sd5e
