6758946,0,t1_d0icv3v,All gerbils have a naked patch where their scent gland is. Some are barely noticeable others are larger  that one has small tumors on it but see how wide it is? If you can get a pic wed happily help evaluate ,gerbil,d0ifjok,1,t5_2sof2
6981989,0,t3_4bbzde,While its not considered their ideal circumstances the fact that shes already alone makes it harder. Youd have to carefully socialise himher with another one over the course of weeks in a split cage before theyd be friendly and not try to kill one another.Alternatively keeping himher alone isnt bad you just need to remember to allocate a lot more time to socialising with himher yourself so that she doesnt get super sad. So short answer  no not an awful idea and youd have a new little buddy!,gerbil,d17qx2r,5,t5_2sof2

8803702,0,t3_50m18g,get  sheetsthrow blankets of different color amp change them out on the floor between gerbils amp find a way to keep them on the blanket.  its also handy for bundling up the blankets amp holding over a trash can to get rid of poop amp easy to toss in washer for pee. wash your hands between playing with each set of gerbils too.,gerbil,d7633ay,1,t5_2sof2
