Unfortunately I wouldnt be able to explain why I thought that but it made sense at the time I thought of it.,IntelligentMinds,dafwvec,3,t5_3hp91

9834338,0,t3_5g4d6s,The universe is a encapsulated environment. Containing matter and anti matter pursuant to the laws of physics. It is the bubble  that space time permeates and has a finite amount of energy and mass. However this bubble environment has no physical boundaries therefore is able to interact and overlap arbitrarily with other bubbles of space time which inhabit four dimensional space on three dimensional planes of existence which expand and contract.,IntelligentMinds,dapfq4x,2,t5_3hp91
