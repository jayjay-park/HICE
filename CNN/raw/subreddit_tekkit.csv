530419,0,t1_cg0k9ex,Big reactors .. was released in stages rc rc rc and latest version which is ..A alpha. RC added the ability for the coolant ports to automatically pump out to adjacent inventories and tesseracts count as an inventory. So I have a coolant port set to output and then a tesseract sitting right on it. It is able to pull as much steam from the reactor as is requested by the turbines which has its own tesseract receiving steam.If you dont want to use tesseracts I recommend the pipes that are part of the extra utilities mod transfer pipes and nodes instead of fluiducts. Transfer nodes with speed upgrades can transfer more than fluiducts. I still ran into bottlenecks but they worked much better. Tesseracts have no bottlenecks though. ,tekkit,cg0kdhu,1,t5_2tokf

6221548,0,t3_3zd21q,There are actually several at least  maybe more types of ingots that dont have EMC values in legends and you have to process them from ore. I set up an engineers toolbox factory that first crushed the ore then refined it using quicklime then spun it in a refinery and then cooked the pure dust into ore. It took about a week to finally get all the ores processing automatically that I was getting from my quarries. Maybe that is something you can look into.,tekkit,cywtmm4,1,t5_2tokf

10532156,0,t3_5qql5r,That stuff was supposed to be disabled by default and enabled with a code in motd.  I think it got flipped at some point where its enabled by default and disabled with the code.There is a list of codes to put in motd it says it is to enable them but since I think it works opposite now you should try to use them to disable.,tekkit,dd1xpsn,1,t5_2tokf
