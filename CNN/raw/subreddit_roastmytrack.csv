5996416,0,t3_3xl3gl,interesting start. attention grabbing. nice mixing in the intro. that low processing is awesome.   damn. well done.Edit If you dont roast youll be banned on your next post. Keep in mind. ,roastmytrack,cy5nt4f,2,t5_3au7l
6011794,0,t1_cy7l3bu,Thanks for the feedback  All of what you have mentioned I agree with and is all part of my current set of problems I am trying to fix for last part no need to worry. I dont plan on going the chiptune route I just wasnt entirely sure how to describe it. Im actually going to create tracks with singing on them as I can actually do that somewhat better. Ive just been experimenting while waiting for my lyric writing skills to improve.  Another response calls it a fugue and after some research Id say thats a better description.,roastmytrack,cy7obql,2,t5_3au7l
6012756,0,t1_cy7eiuq,The issue with the white noise is that its lowpassed too much and the part of the white noise that really makes it sound like a riser is the movement to a higher frequency. This can mean opening it up with an increasing lowpass or by sliding a bandpass up the frequency range. I make my own white noise riser by sampling some really loud white noise and then automating a bandpass filter over it plus some panning. The white noise youve got is just not noticeable enough to be doing its job. Youre right though you definitely dont need big room risers to draw attention to a drop and I dont like to use them either.A better kick means a better sample that really fits with the track. Its pretty subjective but you have clicky kicks punchy kicks housestyle kicks hardstyle kicks and whatever. The kick you have has a pretty long tail and not much high end so it doesnt stand out in the mix it just kind of thumps away in the background. I would get something snappier for a house track and put some weight on it with the Corpus Kick Tight preset in Ableton if youve got it.,roastmytrack,cy7suax,1,t5_3au7l
6053535,0,t1_cycdako,love the feedback thanks man! its definitely a work in progress and the final version is heading in the same way youre thinking. tbh i  wasnt sure what to think of those synths either.. they sounded really cool when I was playing around with them but then not so much. I need a partner.,roastmytrack,cyd49vn,2,t5_3au7l
6094966,0,t3_3z0q2g,I thought the idea for the video part was awesome and really entertaining but I think there couldve been more going on in the drop like a lead bass etc. I think this would be really cool with a launchpad if you beef up the actual music more. ,roastmytrack,cyifo0u,1,t5_3au7l
6188808,0,t3_4081uy,bountiful distortion lt i like that. got a cool glitchy vibe early in the track. like when the melody switches. good note choices. expecting a change at . and you did sorta.. but by change all you did was add on more drums. try to spice up that switch more. consider taking away from the melody for the  bars preceding as an idea. rd attempt at a final mixmaster.. welllllll.. the levels dont seem to be off for what youre trying to convey. id have to hear it on other mediums to judge that further but sounds fine on monitors.  min you go into some crazy shit... that should come earlier in the track because to me thats your bread and butter. thats some interesting intricate use of chaos and could serve you well not only on this track but on future productions all the same. will your listener make it to  minutes is the question.  minutes your going too guitar solo for my likingdance music. now its switched up again to something completely different. the quick pan on it before the break is smooth though. like the .blips. going on at  minutes. nothing is repeating besides the cheapest part of your track. thats an issue. whats the hook. whats the memory of the track? what will make someone want to listen again and again and again? youve got talent. now taming it and using it in an organized manner is your issue. again at  this is some dope complextro style stuff. snare becomes stagnant in that section though. the best word to describe what Im hearing your voice say in this track is the world is chaos  ,roastmytrack,cyt3p7o,1,t5_3au7l

6456411,0,t3_43s0c6,I agree that this song has potential. To me it sounds flat. Theres no real depth to it. I like the melody maybe mix it up a bit. Add some other instruments or lyrics. Something to break the monotony. Its a good start it just needs a little push!,roastmytrack,czn4wgi,1,t5_3au7l

6721527,0,t1_d0ek7rk,Hi thanks for the feedback!I can hear the sounds clashing now youve pointed it out! The snare is sadly part of the drum loop I added on top so Ill have to edit it out sneakily and probably add a tighter one instead.,roastmytrack,d0ekb67,1,t5_3au7l
6730586,0,t1_d0eln2h,Thanks for the input I actually straight up ripped the structure from another song since its one of my weakest areas will be something Ill look into improving from now on.,roastmytrack,d0fi2j7,1,t5_3au7l
6840188,0,t1_d0psraq,I think that has to do with the chaotic nature of the beat. The main gripe I have is with the beat actually. It lacks separation imo and really just becomes a wall of sound rather than separate instruments. Too noisy there wasnt any room left for the vocals.,roastmytrack,d0rn1b2,1,t5_3au7l
7153238,0,t3_4difid,Arrangement is amazing on this track. I really like the chords and the upbeat feel!There are some minor mixing issues that could be solved with a little bit of EQing and volume mixing. Just clear up the low end make sure every element has its own space. Check out midside EQing.Love this track.,roastmytrack,d1r92y8,2,t5_3au7l
7157858,0,t1_d1rry7i,thanks dude good advice. hard to tame that stuff,roastmytrack,d1rs202,1,t5_3au7l
7192093,0,t3_4duwuu,The tone is gorgeous at the start. Its not easy to eq glass sounds. The lead starts out with that nice tone but as you introduced more sounds it started to sound harsher somehow. The dramatic change wasnt really to my liking. The hats in that section were too loud. You went from using some really nice sounds to some more lacklustre ones in that section. ,roastmytrack,d1voiuq,1,t5_3au7l

7262862,0,t3_4eup0h,The lyrics need a helping handful of biodiversity. Otherwise the mix is slightly sloppy but thats fine for what youre doing. Pretty basic sound design. You were going for minimalist vibe but the actual rhythmic stuff isnt cool enough to make me interested in the song. ,roastmytrack,d23qinb,2,t5_3au7l
7272278,0,t3_4ezdxa,The main drop seems like it could use one more element or maybe some vocals. It sounds great though!!  ,roastmytrack,d24t4xb,1,t5_3au7l
7284828,0,t3_4f3m3x,This is actually pretty dope at least for my ears. Nice variations on the drops and nice punchy drums! Solid work,roastmytrack,d268ig6,2,t5_3au7l
7317498,0,t1_d29c5c0,Word Ill have to listen more closely to that maybe play around with the EQ a little more. I just started a few months ago and was just cranking out tracks without paying to sound design EQ mixing etc. so listening to my stuff on different systems is something I just figured out a few days ago. Ill play with the panning too. Thanks for getting back and thanks for the feedback man!,roastmytrack,d29y7db,2,t5_3au7l
7324877,0,t1_d2arkkm,Thanks for the quick reply dude. I will definately toy around with the ideas you presented on the synth. Its a cool thought and I actually really like that synth and wanted to do more with it anyway lol.I will also see what it sounds like to remove that first half. A pitch bend would probably have been easier than what I did for that one haha. I cranked up the bend time and  just inserted a midi note an octave higher than the rest which essentially accomplished a pitch bend. Thanks a ton for your input dude!,roastmytrack,d2ase2m,1,t5_3au7l

7374279,0,t3_4gcape,The track sound a bit flat to me. Also that sample from  to  and throughout gets really repetitive and quite annoying after a short while. Maybe you should change up some things here and there to avoid the track becoming too repetitive. And I would look into your mixing id I were you the mix sounds a bit lifeless and lacks impact. ,roastmytrack,d2gek82,2,t5_3au7l
7567013,0,t3_4iyxym,Very beautiful intro. The percussion coming half way in could be a bit louder though. Nice and thick sub bass. I love the panning of the snare but it could also be just a tad louder.The talking vocals are a nice touch but the quality is a bit lacking.I like the change up on the second drop. Keeps the consistency of this song while making it unique thoughout.the same melody does get a little boring by the end.All in all a solid track! Keep at it!,roastmytrack,d32bzms,1,t5_3au7l
7578278,0,t1_d33kg3z,That means a lot man I appreciate it! I didnt think people would catch that line so props to you brotha.,roastmytrack,d33m45e,1,t5_3au7l

7801116,0,t3_4ls0mp,I would call this ambient because its more focused on tonality and not on rhythm progression or melody. This song didnt really do anything for me since Im not an ambient fan.You might want to look into more examples of the genre from other artists and see how you stack up.,roastmytrack,d3swms2,1,t5_3au7l
7876248,0,t3_4n6uoe,This seems kinda like my work.It sounds like you need to make a few variants of this and maybe a B section to break some monotony so you can get closer to like a  min mark instead of . mins.I like it though good sounds!,roastmytrack,d41d2ni,2,t5_3au7l

8715410,0,t3_4zdsig,I mean shit son what is there to say the track is absolutely bangin. The glitch on the vocals in the drop is super cool. system ememem mmm mm mmIll try and find an issue. I feel like the  bass sound seems loud in the intro and the break maybe you could automate an eq to fade the low mids in a bit? It seemed to jump out a bit suddenly in the break. Just an idea.The main sounds are all killer. That second drop is intense. Mix sounds very big and clear!edit If you feel like you have any advice for achieving the cleanliness your hats and percussion have... I am curious!,roastmytrack,d6v2byc,2,t5_3au7l

8871253,0,t3_51pu3z,Great track.  Only thing i can say is the dubstep growl used the most is a little dated in my opinion.  Some of them are okay but that one that starts the phrase YOI is a little old.Id try something different there and i think youd have one of the better tracks ive ever heard on here!  keep it up man... im gonna give you a follow!!!,roastmytrack,d7e772s,2,t5_3au7l
9230771,0,t3_56qsgt,I give feedback best when I just share my thoughts in a progressive way as I listen to the track. Apologies if it seems a little disorganized loving the intro super fat and loudwow those reverby background melodies are beautiful and sit wonderfully in the mixthat swishy sort of hihat thing is cool I think it might sound better if it was a little sharper. Also what do you think about maybe having a few different sounding hihats that you alternate between?Fantastic switch up at  and it develops really well into The chiller emptier part at  is great too awesome contrast to the parts before and after.Fucking sick drums at !This is just personal preference but the vocal sample at  feels a little out of place. The whole track has been without any sort of voices and it feels like it takes me out of the musiclove the anthemic ending and despite being abrupt the outro works totally well. Overall Im really impressed and the whole thing is super enjoyable!EDIT Also wanted to ask why did you classify this as EDM Metal? I was expecting some kind of screaming or something haha.,roastmytrack,d8m2g5q,2,t5_3au7l
9281949,0,t3_57g2g9,The production sounded good. But the atmo of the song didnt do anything for me. Ok this is going to be hard to describe for me bare with me I didnt feel any relief I just felt disappointed when the drop came because I didnt gain anything off it. The song felt the same the whole way through.,roastmytrack,d8sjym8,1,t5_3au7l

9795726,0,t3_5fiydx,im generally not a fan of moombah but this was pretty cool and i can see it getting stuck in my head today. also never realized how well grime and moombahton can go together lolas far as the mix goes nothing seems to be worth critiquing imo. i do think that main synth melody gets repetitive and sort of annoying near the end though especially with it being such a high frequency. i would recommend switching it up a bit at some point.overall pretty tight though,roastmytrack,dakj9kk,2,t5_3au7l

10698175,0,t1_ddg0je5,Well yes in some ways. For example it is leaning more vertical when headless which helps when taking the notes furthest away from you. ,roastmytrack,ddjfqy6,2,t5_3au7l
