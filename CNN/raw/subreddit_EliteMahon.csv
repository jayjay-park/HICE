4225415,0,t1_cs1twlv,You think we can simply just do nothing and they will go away now? just mind our own business and work on preparation  expansion fortification? these things in themselves are hostile activities they will not simply let us just sit here and get more powerful by the day. if you think this is the case then you are severely mistaken. Our  priority should be to take systems that will give a strategic edge while at the same time bring in a good CC income. I dont mean we should be just going randomly hostile and doing things to piss them off  but if we dont actively oppose them then they will be knocking down our door in no time flat.

If they show aggression against our Sirius allies we should respond to any request for assistance honoring our pact.If after a while the Utopians have proven themselves to be trustworthy and nonaggressive both towards us and our allies we can discuss a TIMBA. However instead of forging a second independant pact with the Utopians we should have trilateral talks about expanding the existing TIMBA to include the Utopians.

4692340,0,t1_ctm05f8,First up seems I misunderstood your post which is on me  We did meet the fortification trigger for  systems but some were undermined and cancelled so it may actually be that the displayed number is . Cant check right now. So it might not be the bug just a reading comprehension failure on my part.As for the bug though if you do have it it affects the overview screen and the stats screen plus the power standings page on Galnet which would all show information from last cycle rather than the current one. The control screen is unaffected. You might also see a nice red turmoil sign instead of the expansion tab since we were in turmoil last cycle.

4970131,0,t1_cukqxcw,gt Now admit your mistake since I already told you and please fix it !Ill admit it  there was a mistake in the spreadsheet that was a holdover from last weeks fortification suggestions.Heres how the priorities of systems are determined. . Is it now  or more undermined OR was it  or more undermined last week?. Is it a system that will be fortified by randoms?. Is it a profitable system?. Is it missing more than  merits OR are there less than  hours left in the cycle?If the answers to these are yes no yes and yes it becomes a high priority system. If the answers are different it becomes a low priority target.Lets go through these for Aasgaa and CybelleQuestion | Aasgaa | Cybelle||. | Yes this week | Yes last week. | No | No. | Yes | YesSo far they are both identical.The difference is in question What makes a profitable system?Well first we need to find the systems income. This is done via a relatively simple calculation Income  Undermined upkeep  default upkeep. | Aasgaa | Cybelle|| Undermined upkeep |  CC |  CCDefault upkeep |  CC |  CCIncome |  CC |  CCNow we need to calculate the profit from each system. The profit is the income  default upkeep. | Aasgaa | Cybelle|| Income |  CC |  CCDefault upkeep |  CC |  CCProfit |  CC |  CCSo far it looks okay. However that version of profit doesnt tell the whole story. We also have to pay the overheads for each system and the overheads are identical for all systems and for Mahon this is currently . CC.  | Aasgaa | Cybelle || Income |  CC |  CC Default upkeep |  CC |  CC Overheads |  CC |  CC Actual profit |  CC |  CC Since Aasgaa isnt a profitable system it will never become a high priority system for fortifications. This is why it is below Cybelle in the list.So why did I say thisgt Ill admit it  there was a mistake in the spreadsheet that was a holdover from last weeks fortification suggestions.Because the spreadsheet had a holdover from last weeks suggestions where we set the profit criteria higher than being able to cover the overheads and on some of the systems it hadnt been changed back. As it happens Aasgaa was one of the systems that had been affected but this doesnt change the correct outcome because Aasgaa is only profitable if it hits its fortification trigger AND doesnt hit its undermining trigger.We have other systems with similar problems and those are systems that it would be okay to lose because it would actually improve our overall ecosystem.I do appreciate the feedback for several reasons.  You asked a very good question.  You made me find a mistake in the spreadsheet.  You made me question the validity of the conclusions in the spreadsheet and thats always a good thing.  You made me realize that instead of hiding a certain part of the mechanism for determining the priorities in the formulas I should move it into a separate column instead which Ive now done. Its called Profitable? and should make it more clear why some systems are low priority in the future.  Instead of simply accepting my conclusions you are looking at them with a critical eye and that is very important in all aspects of life.My response may seem like Im trying to be dismissive or condescending but that is truly not the goal. My goal is to explain exactly how we arrive at the conclusions we do because its better that people question the conclusions and understand the methods than it is for my ego to be stroked by people just blindly following my suggestions.,EliteMahon,cul0syg,3,t5_38hio
