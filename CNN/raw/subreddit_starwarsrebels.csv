Kallus explains that he and his rival arrived on Coruscant at about the same time even though the guide books say that Kalluss homeworld is Coruscant.The comics in the magazines are apparently checked by the Story Group too even though the stories arent likely to be talked about in the actual show.

As of now it is probably the theory I would most like to see happen.The entire Ghost crew turning to the dark side or aiding it in the case of the nonforce users is a huge stretch though. I am not completely resistant to the thought of Ezra having some ancillary role in the Knights of Ren. I absolutely do not see it happening but I imagine Filoni and crew could write that story line fairly well. I do think I want Ezra to go down a dark path with... Old Master.

The specific direction we go depends on who the current villain is and why they were on Alderaan in the first place.Personally I would like it if Thrawn is still around at that point and this is his masterstroke. He knows in advance about the Death Star and knows that Alderaan is going to be its first target. He then uses that knowledge to orchestrate a scenario where all the Rebel forces in this cell have to go to Alderaan at this specific time whether its their last hiding spot or theres a mission objective there which will take their entire fleet to complete. With Alderaan destroyed so to is that Rebel Cell and the crews only connections to the larger rebellion for a time at least.

Sabine is not fleshed out yet and its one of the things theyll be expanding on in the third season theyve promised. Characters develop by interacting with each other and we dont know yet how much if any interaction they might have in the third season. If they do interact a lot its entirely possible it might turn romantic or might not. If it does I think the writing team has the talent to pull it off.It would be interesting to have them act as a foil to some degree. The path Ezras turning down is particularly violent might offer a contrast to Old and New Mandalorians the peaceful bunch not the KOTOR bunch and would definitely be reminiscent of Death Watch. Of course the Force does throw things up in the air.Id argue in season  they threw in a few hints here and there it was just never a major thing. Apparently Ketsu had heard about Ezra?

8775718,0,t3_50ahfm,Well we know the Empire is the ultimate threat but mainly because it is run by an Emperor who is both a military threat and a mystical threat.  This juxtaposition was first alluded to in ANH when Vader says the power to destroy a planet is nothing compared to the power of the Force.  The military threat is the immediate danger to overcome while the mystical aspects of the Force represent the far reaching impacts of how you deal with the military threat.So for those two things to play off each other with any meaning the more dangerous the mystical aspects of the show become Thrawn will have to be equally as dangerous to really showcase the choices the Ghost crew will have to make to overcome the danger.

I dont really care much for Wedge Antilles and this episode is stuck between the Holocrons of Fate and the very promising looking Heras Heroes. So I didnt have very high hopes.  That said this episode was perfect. It was the first time since season  in which a  minute episode was well paced and didnt feel rushed. The characters were amazing. Theres tons of teeny details that I loved like how the Imperial base resembled a Star Destroyer.  Not only that but the episode itself is gorgeous. With the constant sunset which is just really pretty.One of my favorite bits is actually the simulation. Since it proved one thing The Empire is starting to take the Rebellion seriously but even worse than that they know that the Rebellion has one particular ship that is stronger than the others.  Theyre pretty much aware that the Ghost Crew are the heroes.Then theres Kallus. Now during his first appearances in the series I couldnt care much for Kallus. He had epic sideburns and a decent backstory but compared to the Grand Inquisitor he didnt really keep my attention.  But damn theyve made him into a great character. I almost squealed when he said his line.  This episode has so much going on in it without feeling cluttered or rushed unlike this comment which Im writing in the postepisode hype. So I may be biased.  A side note I love that drill sergeants voice. Its so stupid and nasal that I love it.Quick edit  I think what shocked me the most is simply that this isnt all about Wedge. This isnt like A Princess On Lothal which I didnt like or the Lando Calrissian episodes which I did like because it isnt all about that character.  Wedge was important but the episode wasnt the Wedge Antilles episode. This was an action packed well written and great episode.,starwarsrebels,d8jmop0,31,t5_2xavr

9371429,0,t1_d93t4pg,It isnt that genius. Any halfway competent  intellegence agency has operations like that. You give them good but not very damaging information build it up with bigger targets then lay the big trap to take out most of them. If you are smart you have multiple with one never getting caught amd always escaping with a few others to fight another day. This way the rebels keep getting defeated and there will be a known group for revolts to cling to a group you already have infiltrated. Eventually people will see how ineffectual the rebellion is and it will lose support until you can wipe them out without anyone caring.Thrawns true genius come from his appreciation of his enemies not just their skills but their histories and cultures as well. He understands them and is able to anticipate their moves. When you know what move your opponent will make in response to you it ceases to be a conflict and instead becomes a game of solitaire a  test of inevitability. ,starwarsrebels,d93w8so,5,t5_2xavr

9503102,0,t1_d9fl5yr,Yeah but what then? We get maybe  it  seasons? Fuck that man. Adventure time is on season  going on season . GoT too. Plus westworld will be at least  or more seasons. Clone wars when three years in the timeline. And Rex is somehow still allow even with the aging process never being addressed. Or wolf or Gregor just disappearing apparently? We could easily get  seasons if they chase thrawn into the unknown regions. And I think the space whale episode and zeb navigating space with the Force will play a big role. So will thrawn and his whole speech about knowing peoples culture and heras we just werent ready for that admiral comment. Theyll look into thrawn and the chiss plus maul story line will hopefully come in on the finally of season  or early season . Plus time skips. I dont want this show to end for a long time. What will they replace it with? Star wars is huge money plus the animation will just keep getting better. In  seasons itll be absolutely mind blowing. If they can have excellentI mean top of the line xwingthrawn series writing. we could get a good  seasons easily. And the merch opportunities along plus books interweaving itll be worth it. IF the quality increases. Obviously shows like GoT and adventure time have kept the quality the same or better with a few lack luster things here and there. But I dont see viewership for rebels declining anytime soon. If anything itll keep increasing over each season. Especially with the new movies. I mean I am so freaking excited for Rouge one and the possibility that Lando and Han will be on screen together in two years and that they could have other characters from rebels and clone wars in the movie.

9846925,0,t3_5g8mm8,I love the delicious irony going on with Kallus as Fulcrum. This is the same man who helped assassinate a Minister frightened for her life when she tried to join the Rebellion seeking asylum yet also the same man twothree years later who helps a rebel and defecting pilots defect to the Rebellion. And of course hes an Imperial Security Bureau agent hes supposed to be after dissents within the ranks of the Empire that are just like him. I could go on but I dont wanna make this too long.Chopper automatically trusting Kallus reminded me of Appa and Zuko in ATLA when Zuko was also trying to persuade the heroes that hes changed. Since Chops never been around when Kallus did the nicer things Im just going to assume that Chopper messed around with the Fulcrum audio and never bothered to tell anyone who Fulcrum is.Kallus being the Butt Monkey despite having changed for the better already made me happy lol. Not in the weird way but in the humorous delayed karma kind of way.I like that the ending implied that Kallus knows he blew his cover to Thrawn so now Kallus is probably savvy enough to try to get around obstacles Thrawn may put up in information databases and stuff to find the accurate data he can present to the rebels and maybe tell the rebels that he will acknowledge that his information may become unreliable at some point but says that he trusts their judgement. I feel like with that reflection with the crew about trusting Kallus I think Kallus getting inaccurate information without realizing it will end up screwing him over with the crew and itll start leading into his endgame from there.I also really loved Oyelowos performance as Kallus this episode. I liked the franticness not sure if thats the right word? in Kalluss voice when he was trying to convince Ezra and Kanan to trust him in the elevator.I have been waiting for this episode for a long time and Id say its probably my favorite episode in the entire show.

She does have a lack of flaws and vulnerabilities but I feel thats more the fault of the writers not giving her enough depth and character growth a problem hopefully we can resolve this season. I guess shes a power fantasy at best like when you were a kid and made up your own Star Wars character theyd probably come out like Sabine Shes Mandalorian because Mandalorians are cool and she has bright blue hair and shes a rebel and an individual oh and she does graffiti and she has all these skills! she really feels like a character heavily aimed at kids to me which is an issue for older viewers because shes boring with the lack of depth but maybe for little girls shes cool. On the Mary Sue scale I feel like Ahsoka has Sabine beat shes such a special snowflake but Star Wars fans always excuse anything if its a Jedi not that she is one she left the temple before completing her training and somehow she can go toe to toe with Vader now the one who trained her who became so much stronger after turning to the dark side. Oh and she can switch off lightsabers now something only the great Jedi masters can do and shes super important to the story even in rebels she was the one who practically created and pulled together the rebellion. ,starwarsrebels,db6wtgh,4,t5_2xavr

10894150,0,t1_de3lm9p,Again if that was an option why would Maul ever bother dueling or fighting anyone? Why wouldnt he just crush jedis lightsabers or pirates blasters? Or just crush their heads? He doesnt so I assume thats not really an option though Im sure someone as powerful as Palpatine or Yoda could prolly pull it off though.I actually would give handtohand to Maul. Like I said Maul is very much a martial warrior in that most of his Force use seems to be based around augmenting his fighting skills rather than arcane powers.As for the saber throwing...Mandos have energy shields in their gauntlets. So the Mando pretty much just has to block it with his energy shield.I dont think you can deflect a cone of fire. Its not really the same concept as a blaster bolt. I figure if Mace Windu had to retreat from a flamethrower someone like Maul probably doesnt want to try to facetank it either. And that handboltpower seems mostly unique to Vader. And again...Maul is not as powerful as Vader. Hes just not not by a long shot. Vader is a total anomaly in the Force his power is not normal by typical SithJedi standards.Like I said before as well none of this really matters since Fett and Maul will never meet and even if they did the outcome would depend purely on what the author or direction wants to do with the story. The mando armorvambrace design to combat Jedi yadda yadda is just a plot device that authorsdirectors can use if they wanted their story to go in the direction of the Mando winning so people arent sitting there going huh? how?.,starwarsrebels,de3nkc9,1,t5_2xavr

11024105,0,t1_dehiu4y,They care with Star Wars because theyre footing the bill more or less for a whole mess of new films in a long running saga. They want it to sell. Boba Fett keeps getting pushed back because theyre hesistant to go too dark with them. They want to appeal to a mass audience not just a few people. Thats why Rebels is like it is on the cusp over family friendly. They dont want to risk losing the core audience kids. Marvel in the meantime is slightly more adult centric its audience is a bit older they can get away with more. Star Wars still skews young. Its just how it is.The allusions to the Nazis will always be there. You cant escape it. Even if theyre not as bad. Which is hard to argue when you see all the terrible crappy stuff they do. Alderaan was not an isolated incident just blown up to a singular planetwide mass murder instead of slow crushing death.And then you say It doesnt have to be for kids while arguing it can still appeal to kids. Make up your mind please.So you want to portray the forces against the Empire the Rebels as horrible awful terrible people. Present the Rebels the good guys for the majority of your official film series... as bad.Yeah do I even need to point out the problems there? Even if its not the official Alliance or a different group it still presents various problems concerning the depiction of the brand.No that creates contrivances. Youre trying to force some grim gritty narrative onto a series that is meant to be a homage to classic scifi serials. Youre making the heroes evil and trying to present imperials as misunderstood. It doesnt work because in the context of the wider universe they arent. Theyre the bad guys they do bad things. You make them sympathetic you make the stormtroopers more than just Henchmen and you basically start wondering WHY they arent turning on a government that is clearly frickin evil.Ive written from the perspective of Stormtroopers in my fanfic I know you can write them as more than just D cardboard characters. But you cant pretend they arent the villains ultimately. They are. They might not think they are but they are. Theyre the bad guys. Trying to pretend theres a moral grey here is pointless. Theyre called Stormtroopers for a reason.Its boring what you describe is boring. Its just watching a bunch of Nazi standins complaining about why everyone hates them trying to give them humanity only to have them blow up and then claim the rebels are evil because... he had a family. Yeah everyone has family. One faceless Stormtrooper having a daugther the most cliche way to make a minion sympathetic doesnt undo the fact hes not working for a good cause.There is more the Empire than being just bad guys... but at the end of the day that is who they are meant to be. Ignoring that is impossible and trying to pretend thats not who they are is pointless.,starwarsrebels,dehjw9t,1,t5_2xavr

11579467,0,t1_dg8gn1t,I will note that I absolutely recognize that EU canon Revan and player Revan could and essentially were different from one another I was just speaking more to the dissonance that a wide enough gap between the two can create. A lot of people experienced that with TOR Revan just not feeling right and a Canon Revan thats even more drastically different would definitely shake the tree more.gtThe issue with Revan is IMO that hes part of the old republic continuity which is gonna be a tough one to adapt into the new canon specially with TOR game which still prospers and has a lot of fans.This is a big thing I think too yeah TOR has carved its niche but despite that the LFSG has been pretty clear that its not going to ultimately carry a ton a weight when they get around to that time period in Canon and its sure to alienate some people. They will share some elements as a call back Im sure but I fully anticipate the complete erasure of stuff like Valkorion and Nihilus which imo is for the best and should be done.Otherwise yes I agree the most elegant way of handling it would be via holocron its just that as has already been pointed out theyve sort of played that card already and it would be hard to make work a second time without seeming repetitive.,starwarsrebels,dg8jf0z,1,t5_2xavr

11659595,0,t1_dghh7b5,gtTheyre on the wrong side. This is war not a humanitarian effort. I know. Which is why Rebels specifically strikes me as twisted and onesided and troublingly dishonest. For example We KNOW logically that Rebels must be executing any live Imperials they capture or who try to surrender if for no reason other then they dont have the facilities to secure that many prisoners BUT... thats not the side of war anyone wants to see in their childrens cartoon where the lady with the colorful hair fights people with paint bombs. Hera and Kanan are Space Mom and Dad not makers of child soldiers. Heck this Child Soldier thing is so great the brats of Iron Squadron cant wait to give eachother fun nicknames and kill Imperials and feel like heroes. Killing Imperials is always a Good Thing no matter who is doing it or why. Thats why I wish we got more from Thrawn Yularen or... I guess thats it. Still those two presumably could show us a different side to the Imperials. ... If you read Thrawns book you see he is capable of compassion and forming genuine friendships heck even TARKIN can do that much but onscreen these characters have to be either totally evil Thrawn steals toys melts speederbike guys and picks on little kids or absent Yularen only had one brief appearance in one episode where he did very little. Its moments like this when I miss Pellaeon. That guy was an unambiguously Good Man who happened to be devoted to a Bad Cause. He was with the Empire BECAUSE he had compassion and a sense of nobility and a reason to believe he was serving the greater good. He was a bit strict and dictatorial but no one can doubt that he only had good intentions. Hes a Space Nazi sure but hes the sort of Space Nazi you could trust to babysit your kids. Theyd be bored but theyd be safe and anyone who came near would get an Imperial gun in the face. Im not sure Id use Hera as a babysitter. Shed probably have the kids organized into a commando squad and out conducting raids by the time I got home... adorable yeah until you remember that real people get hurt... and if someone came near Im imagining Hera would tell the kids to fight back show em whos boss.

11787084,0,t1_dgw1rfw,Ahsoka is literally immortal since the Sister did that Weirdness on Mortis. Death is relative to her. And Plot Armor is obviously suspended when it comes to the films. That is the only place where plot significant Heroes can die. Tell the truth thats one reason why despite the many overlaps in ships locations gear and even characters I STILL have a hard time buying that Rebels the cartoon takes place in the same universe as Rogue One. What happened in one would be literally impossible in another. Even tertiary supporting Heroes dont die like that on the cartoon. ,starwarsrebels,dgw3ssc,-5,t5_2xavr
