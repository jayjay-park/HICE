2886461,0,t1_cnw65kz,Its completly understandable.  I get it. Thing is many places and people see it as acceptable.  While others dont. Like Washington state.  I got a good friend that has moved there. He has had back problems. Crushed a vertebrae the docs are more then happy to give him scripts for opiates.  He would rather smoke weed for pain management.  Thats ok with me. He says its better health wise too. He sounds better from the days when he was in south Carolina.  It isnt legal there or at least it wasnt when he lived there.You can go thru my post history and see I frequent rconspiracy I will admit my tin foil hat shines bright sometimes. I play devils advocate in there. Its my nature to question everything. I am sorry for that. Everyone here seems to just want to help. Its nice that the ones asking for help actually open up to you. That makes a big difference.  Its nice they want to be open and not just I need money .....the end. I am not the type to give money I will however offer assistance with food diapers or toys for kids. The worse thing as a parent is your kid having a bday and you not being able to give them anything. You can rationalize it to yourself and to them but I promise it hurts you down deep. That is where I will help if I can. I also can help by pointing in the right direction or with my black belt in google fu. ,Need,cnw6z27,0,t5_2wthz
