428665,0,t1_cfp4phq,People also need to keep in mind that there are machines that bridge the gap between manual and CNC. For instance there are tracer machines that would mechanically follow a  pattern of the design you want milled. So you could have your very best machinist make the pattern at great cost of time and money I assure you and then the tracer could reproduce it. Also Im no car expert but isnt it very possible that older transmissions werent this compact and intricate? And would therefore be easier to machine? EDIT I was on mobile before and didnt watch the video nor did I take a superclose look at OPs image. Both the valve body shown in the video and the OP are very clearly cast and you can see the casting surface finish in the grooves. This means that the grooves were not machined at all but were molded in their current forms. The top surface of the casting was machined so it is very flat but the grooves havent been touched by a machine.Now the die that made it or sandcasting form but given the intricacy Id go with die would be very impressive and intricate but you only need to make one of those to get a couple thousand of the finished parts.,MachinePorn,cfp72t0,19,t5_2sdcw

599105,0,t1_cg8c5q7,Interesting. I can see two potential issues  one is that the price you pay for it being disconnectable is that its less efficient when its actually in use because you have to convert mechanical energy to electrical and then back again. The second is that how is the flow from the supercharger regulated? The nice thing about mechanicallydriven superchargers is their speed is linked to engine speed. For positivedisplacement superchargers like Roots and twinscrew types this means that the boost pressure stays relatively constant through the engines power band because the flow rate changes in the same way as the engines air demand. An electricallydriven positive displacement blower would either have a very weird powerband if it was run at a fixed speed or would require some additional complexitycircuitry to make its speed vary as needed.Not sure how it would work with a centrifugal.,MachinePorn,cg8de5z,3,t5_2sdcw

1646463,0,t1_cjmcv8p,Tacitus basically covered what I was referring to.  This particular railgun doesnt seem particularly suited to shooting other naval ships.  For reference the USS Cole bombing blew a ft hole in the side of the destroyer and failed to sink the ship.  This railgun appears to punch a grapefruit sized hole in steel.  That would take a lot of rounds to disable an enemy ship.Im no naval artillerist but I imagine that naval guns can be set to airburst which kills people more effectively than having the bomb explode on the ground.  The railgun cannot at this juncture do that.  The round they mentioned in one of the videos stated that it will have guidance so I suppose it could have some kind of explosive at some point.Perhaps with a much larger railgun you could shoot a  ton bomb at very high speeds at someone.

2808537,0,t1_cnmsbf1,gt And surprise cars that are more expensive? Back ordered for months or years.Im glad you brought that up because it illustrates my argument.Certainly when a new model of supercar is released theres a back order that can last for years. But I said the same about plane engines or entire planes when a new model is released. But after theyve plateaued and filled the back orders you can buy them off the shelf. The same as with most supercars. There are dealers that have them in stock right now.Of course if they did build bigger factories and ramp up production to satisfy oredrs in a year instead of taking three then theyd saturate the market in the first two years. Everyone who wanted one would have one and theyd have nothing to do until the next model was developed which may be years away. Theres only so much demand for super expensive cars.Of course the exception is when theres a special model thats a limited edition with a limited number being made. Most of the time in those cases you have to be invited to buy one or you have to be approved. They deliberately limit the numbers to retain the value and exclusivity for their most valued customers. If there was no limit and anyone could buy them then the mega wealthy wouldnt be as interested.Theres nothing exclusive about a jet engine. They want to make and sell as many as they can to anyone whos got the money.,MachinePorn,cnnblyl,1,t5_2sdcw

Beneath the Jesus but lies the thrust washer and you also have split cones and a lower pressure plate. All of these act like a sandwich simply put but the split cones are what actually keeps the rotor head on. Now dont get me wrong the Jesus nut wont just back off because of a series of bolts that thread through the Jesus nut and push down on the thrust washer. And the rotor blades are attached to extenders with  bolts which are attached to sleeve and spindle assemblies on the main rotor head. ,MachinePorn,cun7clt,0,t5_2sdcw

Yes yes they do but either way they have to be cleaned regularly. This is approximately as much of an expensive pain in the ass as youd expect it to be and a BIG reason why diesel locomotives took over but the engines are designed to make it a bit easier to clean. It also helps that you can have larger tolerances with steam engines than you can with diesel engines so some impurities or buildup on moving parts and valves is less Oh shit this could quickly destroy the engine and more Oh shit Ive got to clean that later.In fact when engines like this need refilled with water its common to ask the local fire department to do it  as theyre the only ones in most areas who are used to moving such huge volumes of water in a timely manner. The fire departments just use their own local water source. Steam locomotives today being as rare as they are cant rely on the presence of water towers along the rail track to refill even with the use of a water tender.,MachinePorn,cvba90e,1,t5_2sdcw

When the big one goes through they use these engines.  Usually  at a time or more when its full.  Then on the way back I can see all the empty auto racks and I dont know about the others cars when they go back..  But Ive seen ft plus trains and they always seem to have  engines in front.Also as they pull very long double stack containers into Belen they have  and  engines up front!  Perhaps it has to do with altitude?  Im not any good at identifying locomotives or how much power they have so I dont know.

So you have a high pressure low velocity fluid moving into the combustor add gas now you have a high velocity lower pressure fluid moving through the high pressure turbine. Another thing all these engines have is cooling air running through the HPT components. The cooling air is routed from the compressor around the combustor into internal cavities of the part. The pressure differential between the cooling air and combustion air allows the cooling air the exit the cavities and onto the part surface. This air creates a protective barrie to help prevent the part from melting.  ,MachinePorn,d4ol3xq,1,t5_2sdcw
