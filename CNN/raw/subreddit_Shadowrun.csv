41611,0,t1_cej5nqi,Then its probably time to house rule the way the gloves work.  Under th ed rules the non lethal weapon is superior to the equivalent lethal weapons in every way.  The rules are at fault as theyre simply not balanced.  So your options are ignore the rule and ask people to not create situations where its needed fix the rule with a house rule or compensate for the broken rule by taking non realistic in game actions such as ubiquitous shock resistance.Youve got to pick one of those options...Personally if I didnt want to step on the Sams niche Id start looking at house rules.  Try using the th edition electricity damage rules.  No secondary effect if there is no damage loss of initiative and a  dice penalty.  th Ed also removes the BodWil roll to resist being incapacitated but personally Id probably keep that.  ,Shadowrun,cej62kj,2,t5_2s4v2

334980,0,t1_cff3jw5,The funny thing is I agree that reasonable stuff from earlier editions should be allowed but the OP stated right out that its SR only so the suggestions to use SR stuff were bound to cause problems. Regardless of whether one agrees its perfectly possible to suggest changing the ruling without being rude.Im GMing a new SR game and if my players want to bring in something from an earlier edition talk to me about it and the answer is probably yes. That said none of my players have any books besides the SR core book and arent likely to get any. I could see making a strict SRonly rule if the table thought it wasnt fair that someone with a big library got to do things that other people without it couldnt. Since I have by far the most SR books of anyone that doesnt seem likely.I feel that there is plenty that isnt being fully communicated here like  OPs table dynamic. OP doesnt seem unhappy with how things are going nor like a gaming newb so the GM probably isnt actually that tyrannical.  Its the GMs game isnt that controversial a statement given how often rule books say something like The GM has the final say in rules disputes. Decisions like what rule books to include are typically the GMs call. Most GMs are reasonable people and so are open to reasonable propositions like There are no rules for buying security doors in SR but there are in SR and they convert directly. Can I use them? which OP said heshe would try. Outside of closely regulated conventionstyle play no GM Ive known would deny that.

He was already has multiplepersonality disorder in life and I can see this only amplifying in the Matrix. Which just leaves Celedyr the only Great mucking around with the Matrix which I personally think is going to bite in him in the tail one day.  In my head canon Dues Mirage  and Megaera have effectively become the Deep Resonance and as a result have become akin to the christian god Father Son Holy spirit. Mirage Megaera Dues and effectively rule the Matrix the same way and they keep a close eye on NeoNet and Celedyr. Even created AIs called Daemons for my games which effectively serve them Angels and Daemons.

Ive read the E core book and im currently playing E while im sure some people will disagree with me theyre not massively different. Of course at the same time they are but the way the game is played and the most basic rules are similar so I dont feel that changing from one to another would be a huge problem.Others here can surely help more than me on that topic.As for tricked out cyborg? Hell yes! You lose an arm? Have the whole thing replaced with a robotic one it can be stronger more agile armoured and you can have a gun mounted in it or wolverine type retractable blades. Legs with hydraulic calves so you can jump higher and fall further safely sure! Replace your eyes with cybereyes that can see in thermal vision have better accuracy and transmit your vision to your team no problem. Have your entire nervous system amped to the point that you can react faster than should be humanly possible quite common among Street Samurai. Your bones can be coated in tougher materials to boost your durability. Your muscles can be augmentedreplaced to make you stronger and more agile overall.Now granted you cant necessarily do ALL of that or if you can maybe not cheaply.

The scars might be almost invisible but some people scar more than others. A few towns folk have the same slight scarring in the same place say behind their right ear upon further investigation it can be seen that more people all if you have a good enough perception have the same scars. Detailed matrix searches report that some people have  active commlinks one running silent. Further investigation leads to everyone having a silent commlink the implanted one. Shipping manifests show X thousand of the same brand of commlink shipped in... possibly too obvious maybe theres a lot of them  of the population looking further leads to the rest being smuggled in by other means unusual for a legal product. Assensing could lead to both the oddly imbalanced emotional state and the presence of cyberware in everyone. As common as cyberware might be everyone having it could be considered weird. The Face could pick up on the fact that everyone seems to know a little too much about what others are doing. You tell one person something specific and a different person asks you about it. They brush it off as small town gossip even if it would have required a commlink call directly.

900986,0,t3_24fmt8,Ok first things first. Where exactly was Dodge? Hong Kong? If so the E sourcebook Runner Havens can provide an excellent source of hooks for Triad Wuxing and Lung related plots. However digging up an obscure sourcebook for one plot hook seems overkill. We can do this on our own. So whats a secret worth killing over?Now if your player was extriad there really is no reason to go nuclear and have it be related to some hugely powerful separate entity. No discovery of a vast conspiracy related to an AI or a Dragon necessary. Nobody ever leaves the Triads really so running off may have gotten him on a hit list and the fact that he holds some juicy secret just sweetens the reasons to off him. Maybe the character discovered that a high level associate in the triads was having an affair with the beloved wife of a rival faction leader that they are supposed to be allied to. The secret getting out could lead to a huge loss of face for both parties and lead to a massive business disrupting gang war and someone thinks your character is too much of a risk to business to leave alive. But being out of town maybe we need to step this up a little as leaving may have mitigated the risk of blood being spilled.So what other reason does a Triad member need to kill. How about consolidation of power? Maybe a member came to power by betraying his own people to a rival and the secret getting out would cause a hit to be placed on him. Rather than risk the secret being exposed by the character for whatever reason he decides that the character needs to become a permanent underwater resident.Or maybe he discovered a high level Triad member was a WuxingPoliceSome rival faction mole working his way up slowly and carefully over the years secretly feeding information to the wrong people and that person and the organization he really works for knows you found out. So rather than risk years of infiltration being flushed down the toilet they decide to off the character.

When he returned to the boardroom he brought with him an unthinkable plan. He wanted to move the corporate headquarters of Yamatetsu to Vladivstock.  This was unthinkable even to Yuris few supporters... That is until Buttercup gave a twentyfive minute speech urging the board to vote for Yuris plan. She also brought forth a staggering amount of voting stock both owned and proxy and called on Ramon Dizons assistance. With the minority bloc Dizon brought with him Yuris stock and Buttercups own they were able to force the vote in their favor.Remembering her debt to Dizon Buttercup worked closely with Wuxing Inc. to join the Pacific Prosperity Group PPG. The PPG was a coalition of corporations that banded together to fight against the Japanacorps economic dominance in a call that hearkened back to Yamatetsus own beginnings.Buttercup was able to use the confusion of the move and the financial backing of the PPG to attain a  majority of Yamatetsu stock. Between her Yuri Rizon and the Filipinno minority they Japanese backers were suddenly outgunned when it came to passing a vote in the boardroom. They were now the minority and any hope of working with the other Japancorps went right out the window.The move to Vladivostok took almost two years but well leave off there. The move the maneuvering that when on in the boardroom and the power plays at work really belong more to Evos Know Your Enemy So Ill make sure to begin there.Sources!

So the exterior is shielded but the interior devices can still communicate wirelessly.Kinda.  You have two options for connecting to the Matrix. You can connect to a Grid or you can connect to a Host.If youre in an isolated area you cant get on the Matrix as you cant connect to a Grid.  Which means to have connectivity you need an isolated host that you can connect to.These exist but they tend not to have wireless that can be breached by someone leaving the wrong door open or someone drilling a hole through a wall and sticking in an antenna.  When there is no Host involved isolation is generally used to kill wireless networks not separate them. gt That being said couldnt a TM make a cage in their basement and create a pocket network for Sprites? I get that everything wants to be wireless but hidden is always an option. So the TM leaves a basic commlink lying on the table in case theres a driveby network check or whatever.

1094236,0,t3_26n8um,. Depending on GM interpretation most of your devices show up as a single PAN with the exception being Smartlink Weapons Drones or anything that an enemy Decker is specifically searching for. But surface wise it would just be a PAN with all the individuals devices under that category. Certain items that are restricted or forbidden might show up outside your PAN because of their dangerous illegal nature but that depends on the DM andor item. . Not sure on official rules for that but I usually play it that you would have to mark the comm link or deck specifically not just something connected to the network. . Its randomized but I remember seeing something saying it can be randomized between a specific target. so say for example you wanted to have it search for smartlink weapons and you did your randomized matrix perception test it would randomly select one of those weapons rather then randomly finding one item out of all those in the AOE. I could be wrong about that but its how our dm plays it and it seems to work pretty well as a balance between overpowered and too weak.Hope some of this helps.,Shadowrun,chso2yq,2,t5_2s4v2

I have been super busy lately and have just had zero free time to write one up sadly.Youve hit the head when it comes to Wuxings role in the shadow community. Theyre the megacorporation that everyone forgets about and they play up that reputation. They have a middling to good intelligence network and pay fairly average. Thats not to say that their security isnt good. They are a AAA megacorp so they can afford to pay for some of the best toys and well trained troops. So dont expect a cake walk...As for the Coins of Luck there are four of them indeed. They originally or at least as far as we can tell belonged to a Great Dragon named Mountainshadow before the Scourge of the th World. The coins were hidden away in the Vault of ElAethor by a rebellious group of elves. Where they stayed hidden until the Second Theran War broke out when the Vault was devastated.They next appear as legend in the th World during the Xia Dynasty in China. Supposedly the DragonKings gave the four coins to humanity each representing a different type of good luck. The DragonKings were servants of the Celestial Emperor and controlled the rains from their crystal palaces in the four seas surrounding China.The Four Coins are rumoured to have the ability to sway luck in one of four areas depending on the specific Coin. In addition to their individual powers as a collective they unlock an even bigger effect. Its believed that with the Four Coins in hand one can divine the perfect moment to cast a spell for maximum effect. IThe last time the Four Coins were together in one please was in . The Mongols invaded Japan in that year and the Japanese Emperor used to the Coins to divine the precise moment for his priests to summon a Divine Wind to smash the Mongol fleet. His efforts were successful in preventing the Horde from landing on Japanese Shores.These ancient magical artifacts resemble early Chinese bronze coins each one round engraved with faded characters and possessing a square hole in the center of the coin. Each coin is worth nearly a million nuyen based solely on age they are at least  years old said to date back to the Xia Dynasty. They appear like other coins from the Xia Dynasty but never tarnish. The Coins are difficult to tell apart as each possess the same four faded characters and does not tarnish. Furthermore the Coins auras are masked which can only be pierced by a skilled magician. However once the masking is pierced one of the characters on the face of the Coin fu lu shou and feng will glow revealing which of the coins it is.Heres a break down of the Four Coins what happened to them and what they are believed to be able to do individually... The First Coin of Luck Prosperity  Wealth the Lu Coin  The Lu Coin was granted to to a poor fisherman named Sun YatSun of Hong Kong in the secret portion of the Big Ds Will. Sun supposedly had performed some service for the Great Dragon in the past and the Coin was his reward. Unfortunately Suns prosperity did not last long. He was assassinated by Yakuza forces posing as Triads. It was then stolen by an unknown agent and fell into the hands of the Sons of Thunder runner group. They tried to sell it to the actual Triads Yak posers in reality and were almost killed. It was then in the possession of the Great Eastern Dragon Ryumyo until . It was then stolen by an agent of the Great Western Dragon Ghostwalker. Ghostwalkers agent died suddenly upon arriving in Denver and the Coin disappears from sight. Some say Ghostwalker has possession of it but no one knows for sure. Most recently the Awakened runner Lei Kung claims it was in an anonymous lock box located in the Kowloon Walled City though how it got there is unrevealed.  This Coin is said to bring great material wealth to the possessor if they are able to hold on to it long enough. If misused it supposedly brings down bad luck on the owner.  The Second Coin of Luck Longevity the Shou Coin  The Second Coin was granted to the Great Eastern Dragon Lung by the Big D in his Will. The request said To Lung I leave the Second Coin of Luck in hopes that he might benefit from the long view as I have.  The Shou Coin is assumed to grant the bearer an extended lifespan. What this means for Great Dragons is up for debate. However like the other Coins if misused it will strike back the bearer with bad luck. The Third Coin of Luck Fertility the Feng Coin  As we discussed above the Third Coin was given to Sharon ChiangWu in the Big Ds Will saying simply  To Sharon ChiangWu I leave the Third Coin of Luck.  As mentioned this Coin is thought to be associated with fertility and growth in all things. It could explain the Wu quintuplets and Wuxings meteoric rise up the Corporate Ladder. Its also believed to be a powerful focus for healing magic.  And of course bad luck follows those that misuse it. The Fourth Coin of Luck Good Fortune  Happiness the Fu Coin  Akira Kageyama was the son of a Japanese pop singer who claimed to have been impregnated by a dragon. Akira does possess certain unusual attributes which may lend credence to this. Kageyama was also a financial consultant to a number of companies and one of Dunkelzahns Watchers. He also received the Fourth Coin of Luck as a secret bequest.  The Vancouver condoplex was apparently built by Dunkelzahn on a whim in the s after he read in a Chinese storybook that dragons are supposed to live in crystal palaces under the sea. The condoplex is indeed under the sea and made entirely of glass. Kelvin the master craftsman who made the glass for the condoplex became a master mage after the Awakening and combined his skills. They say he managed to fuse his essence with the glass living on in the walls of the crystal palace in astral form. Three Adult Eastern dragons known as Mang Chiao and Li possibly working for Lung Rymuyo Wuxing or just themselves learned of the Coin and attempted to steal it but were ultimately unsuccessful. In the end the shadowrunner Night Owl sold a fake coin and kept the real one. This Coin brings happiness through good fortune to the user. And causes anyone holding it to be washed in happiness or joy. Its unknown whether this Coin brings bad luck on those who attempt to misuse it or not. Some believe that the Fu Coin is the only that is unable to be abused.   ,Shadowrun,ci5nmhb,3,t5_2s4v2

1523989,0,t3_2bmm7w,This is one if the reasons why I tend to GM rather then play SR. Though Ive found as Ive gotten older that my abilities to separate what I know have gotten better then when I was younger. When I do play I tend to make support characters not in numbers but in personality. I cant do group lead and I only add to the planning where it would be fitting and then only at the end. One way to partially work around this is through knowledge skills but those can really only take you so far. Also remember that in sll theory supplement books are written ingame because anyone with shadowlands access could read them. Which is why they leave parts vague. This doesnt help a GM who knows less about the setting then the players do though.  And why I never ran Forgotten Realms games in DnD.Edit the one thing to be careful though is getting to far off when adding new stuff. Ive got a friend who really likes SR but got very loose with cannon concepts and eventually just quit reading books or supplements. This lead to him GMing a game that I could stand to be in and having a player base of Shadowrun players floating around who had never actually played Shadowrun. Which lead to them joining other SR games having completely misinformed notions and concepts that ended up driving them away from the game.,Shadowrun,cj7b4qr,3,t5_2s4v2

And since were going through all the major runs so far theyre quickly becoming Sixth World buffs too. That was the main idea. The Sixth World is dense and its hard for all of that information to stick. Unless that is youve been there and done that in game. Then its not just random factoids in a book it was the reason you lived or died on a run. And those facts stick with players for life.

1900765,0,t3_2f2ezn,I played an older guy with mainly cyber eyes a heavy pistol and an old rifle. Used a personality program with his flyspy and argued with it. Only other cyber was an under the tongue gun. Regardless this isnt about him.We had a friends girlfriend playing with us since my fiance was playing too. She went back to college right when  of  players got captured her a gun bunny. And our decker. Decker hacked and bricked the vehicle he was in and escaped but wasnt able to stop her vehicle before it got out of signal range. Our decker found her about  weeks later strung up by the organ slinger gang that caught her. Theyd removed her cyber arm already and wanted to get the rest from her too. We smooth talked our way in sans our decker and left all our weapons behind as per the rules of the chop shop. I pretended interest in buying some second hand cyber arms until we found hers. I blew some smoke about recognizing it from a bitch that double crossed me and asked if they still had her. When guy grinned and told us yes I offered nuyen to see her before they finished.I made a big bullshit speech about no one crossing me while she suffered from shock and bleeding out. Then the hammer fell. We play a dark fucking game and the GM ran npc says I think well have some fun with her before we rip that commlink out. And offered me a go. So I say yes and get access to the Butcher room shes hanging in with a few docs and guards around. I touch her check and say you deserve this and give her a kiss. I shoot off  rounds from the under tongue gun and end her right there. By deserve this I meant a clean death obviously but they thought I meant just death. They make a big ado about me sneaking a gun past but the guy who walked us in clears us from the guards and tries to hire a team with such a heartless bastard for some dirty work. We end up toppling their little empire by bringing in RFID tagged ware we stole from a mortuary our decker tagged it and added physical switches for the tags so the load passed the scanner and we turned the tags on as we offloaded the ware.

1906084,0,t1_ckgw7dx,gtI think this post was intended for the player not so much the GM.I mentioned that at the beginning of the post. This was meant for new players to Shadowrun. I might need to do a companion piece for GMs. Thats not a bad idea at all.But Im confused as to why you say its only half right. Being that it was written for new players and not new players and GMs which part is wrong?gtRemember its a game and the players are the characters and the GM is the vehicle to take them to their star performance.This is something I actually disagree with in Shadowrun. I would totally agree with it in DampD or Pathfinder or some other epic hero adventure game. But Shadowrun isnt like that. Its a dystopian world where the setting is quite literally trying to keep the team down.The GM making it to where the players can breeze through the opposition to get to their star performance is the exact opposite of dystopian. Starting characters are not special or immune to the threats of the Sixth World. As a matter of fact they should feel like little worms on a big fraggin hook.That being said if they are able to survive to the point where they become Prime Runners then that focus shifts. Now theyve proven that theyre the best of the best and able to take on all challenges. Thats when they become the unique runners of the Sixth World. Because lets face it starting characters are literally the bottom of the barrel. Anyone can make your exact same character if they Prioritize correctly. They arent unique in any sense of the word.It isnt until they get Karma and Nuyen that they rise above the pack and become unique.,Shadowrun,ckivddl,2,t5_2s4v2

2193335,0,t3_2k73g1,Ive got some basic advice for you.. ALWAYS have a plan of action. Every step you take that isnt on territory you already know about is a step that can get you killed.. Have contingency plans that account for EVERY variable outside your control. This will help you coursecorrect WHEN your plan goes sideways. Not IF WHEN.. ASSUME only that the plan is going to fall apart at some point in the mission.. Do your homework. Research and Intelligence Gathering is KING in Shadowrun. Combat skills arent even needed if you do your homework right.. Be polite be efficient and have a plan to kill everyone you meet. Collateral damage makes the Corps mad and risks damaging whatever youre in there for. So be polite to avoid having to pull the guns spells and clubs out. Be efficient to keep the level of destruction to a minimum and pray the Corp doesnt get angry. Have a plan to kill everyone you meet because not having a plan means the runs going to go South.. Have escape plans for every step of the mission. If the job goes south you need to be ready to run for your lives.. If you can do so steal janitorial and maintenance uniforms from the company youre breaking into. Youll probably have to split the party a bit but your Decker wont draw as many bullets in meatspace if he looks like the IT guy fixing a bug in the system.. If youre running against SaderKnupp If the guy who just walked in on you isnt armed and wearing a nice suit... do not shoot him. You got unlucky and Lowfyr was in the building. Do not make happy fun time Lowfyr angry. Apologize profusely and beg for mercy... and maybe a job. If youre lucky the job youre on is an audition for something bigger. If youre unlucky...

2225850,0,t1_clmqz38,Marks are a game representation of having a User Name and a Password to access something in real life.Having  Mark is like being a standard User. When your character logs into their Hotmail account they have  Mark to access the email Host.Having  Marks is like a Power User or something. You have a little more privileges so you can change some settings but youre not as powerful as your company Admins. Marks is the Admin level. They can make all sorts of changes to settings and such.Only the registered Owner of a device can get up to  Marks on a device. These are automatically there whenever you want them. So when it comes to using something like Trace Icon and it says you need Marks on something to trace it... you can always track down your stolen car bc you automatically have  Marks on it.When you use Erase Mark you have to have Marks on the device youre trying to erase. If the teams Street Sam got hacked and now somebody has Marks on his gun you need to get your own Marks on the gun first before you can erase the enemy Marks.When the enemy hacker doesnt necessarily need to be a Host gets Marks on you and your stuff you automatically have the Marks permissions to affect yourself.

2388921,0,t3_2mrefa,I try to never have the players painted into a corner completely. Killing a made man is a bad idea but its not inevitably fatal or no one would ever kill one. So yeah you could just keep throwing Vory at them until they die. It sounds like what should happen but remember the Vory arent an unstoppable superpower. Theyre an international crime syndicate so theyre serious players but their resources arent infinite and the runners fall somewhere low on the list of priorities. If they keep sending hitters after the runners and they keep getting sent back heads it becomes expensive for them in money and reputation. Its hard to be an infamous and feared crime syndicate when you cant actually kill the people who cross you. You can use their Vietmanese mob contacts to help them since the Vory wasting resources hunting the PCs is a bonus for them. Since theyre already on the Vory hit list the Vietmanese can hire them to hit Vory operations for them. Have the Vietmanese deal with them through neutral proxies their middlemen will have middlemen to keep the Vory off the scent. Theyll pay the PCs or let them keep their loot and will supply them with what they need for a mark up!. It will look to the Vory like the PCs have just gone to war with them and it also gets the PCs paid while most of the shadows want nothing to do with them. You could eventually tie them into the Vietmanese mob getting them made which would protect them but also make them beholden to their bosses.You could keep the pressure on the runners for awhile until the bodies start piling up and then have the Vory make a big push. Grab an NPC assassin from one of the books or make up yourself someone whose skills cost and have a whole adventure where the assassin just tries to bait them and trap them really mean shit. If they win the Vory let the matter lie for awhile having spent too much money for not enough vengeance and get called off. This doesnt mean they forgive the blood debt just that theyre not actively pursuing it. Your PCs will remain shoot on sight for the Vory and anyone tight with them will probably not deal with the runners. Others will deal with the runners but probably try to keep it low key. You can always have more Vory show up new guys looking to make their bones and have them take a shot at the runners. But really you want to save up the revenge bank on the players. Wait a looong time long after they think everything is fine. Theyre enemies with the Vory but so are a lot of people and they may be under the Vietmanese mobs protection. Then have a new player show up like the dead Vory LTs brother or father. Someone for whom this is personal and for whom the Vorys failure to take vengeance is a personal affront to their reputation. They are here to clean up this mess and bury the PCs hard core. They dont give a shit about the Vorys rackets in the city theyre here for revenge so theyre willing to burn the Vorys operations to get at the PCs. At that point in the campaign the PCs should be stronger and fairly confident and settled. Have the new Vory enemy announce their presence and intentions publicly so the PCs have fair warning at whats coming. Then you declare postsoviet bloc gangster vendetta on them. Their apartments and safehouses are burned down the Vory torch whole apartment blocks full of innocents to try to kill the PCs. Their cars are bombed even if it fails to kill them an expensive vehicle just got blown to shit and bystanders are hurt. Their contacts are attacked neutral parties who do business with them get their legs broken and are told exactly why theyre getting stomped. Their actual friends and allies are killed or badly wounded. The Vietmanese mob if theyre still in tight with them is basically threatened with all out gang war if they dont drop the runners right now. Depending on how close they are you can have it go either way. If anyone has the Dependent flaw they get kidnapped if they took that flaw never threaten the Dependent before this so it will be that much more surprising. Basically the citys on fire like in The Dark Knight and everyone knows why. The Vory. Want. The Party. DEAD.The cops are after them the shadows are turning on them people are dying and their lives are circling the drain.And then the local Vory ask for a meeting.They want to make a deal and reach out to the Vietmanese to referee with the PCs. They dont want any part of this war anymore which is why they dropped it originally. Vengeance got in the way of business so they stopped. This new guy has made VENGEANCE their business and they are hemorrhaging money and bodies the heat is coming down theyre basically embroiled in an undeclared gang war and worst of all theyre not earning any money. This whole war is a loss for them but the outside guy doesnt give a shit its not his town or his money. Even if they win and he gets his vengeance their operations will be ruined. So a resolution is required. Killing the PCs would certainly work but theyve lost a lot already and there isnt much profit in that. They want to bury the matter permanently and get paid back for some of what they spent so far. So they want the PCs to kill the outsider boss and deliver his warchest to them. The guy liquidated most of his assets to fund this war so hes got bank sitting there in reserve. The local Vory have cooked up a scheme to frame him and his dead relative the one the PCs killed for embezzling and treachery and all kinds of good shit. So the PCs cack the bastard loot his corpse pay off the local Vory and clear their good names. The local Vory will tell the Vory Commission a story about treachery and these outsiders who uncovered it and were wrongly persecuted for it but they uncovered it and did what was necessary and now everything is square. No more vengeance back to business as usual the outside guy was responsible for all the bad stuff. So the whole thing gets wrapped up nicely...or does it!?,Shadowrun,cm6z7qd,9,t5_2s4v2

The fact that they are two stats both used together on a type of defense is an extremely bad thing and creates a critical weakness.Unlike DampD charisma is not really a dump stat. Professional runners are good at networking and blending and charisma  makes it really hard. Granted it is such an archtype to be uncharacteristically bad at that that multiple social disadvantages exist but it is a very deliberate decision that will create problems for you.You lack many key skills. Gymnastics and stealth are rather vital for melee characters because charging straight at someone is generally not a viable tactic you will simply be ventelated trying and die quickly. Stealth is also critical because it prevents you from blowing the run and it is very easy to get enough to be undetectable when not in line of sight. You also roll  dice on ettiquite tests meaning the second a situation becomes remotely stresstful you fall appart you are essentially impossible to get along with and contacts will very quickly leave you.  negotiation means you cant buy things on the black market  con means you really cant lie. The average person probably has around  ettiquite. Clubs at  is an odd pick with a blades as high as you have and as an adept you are encouraged to pick one melee weapon anyway. Basic social interaction is difficult in a manner hard for most people to wrap their head around though he isnt out and out uncouth. He doesnt have to roll in situations others have to but he is utterly incapable in situations with even mind stress or discomfort. He may fly off the handle break down or just insult people to their face when pressed.Adrenalien boost is a decent power but you really forever lock yourself out from improved reflexes taking it. Kinesics is a rather worthless buy for you as your PC is basically required to wear a bag over his head in any situation besides murdering people. You lack unarmed so killing hands is a waste. Pain resistance is regarded as pretty worthless as it is a very situational bonus that is overpriced. Missile parry is ok you have the dicepool to make it work. As a body  adept you have absolutely no reason to take rapid healing they provide a very small relative increase to your overall recovery time.Meta links are pure garbage and should be used as little as possible. You lack any form of ranged attack even throwing knives are vital to survival. You lack any form of image link subvocal communication or enhanced control of your link as well you are going to look silly playing around with the links scroll wheel. Finally you lack armor meaning your lifespan as a melee character is going to be about  seconds.Overall this is a very nonstandard runner. He seems to be socially disabled to the point it may be a condition or psychosis and he exclusively lives for a straight up murderous fight perhaps he was a gladiator or conditioned assassin. It works as a concept but could definitely use some tweaking as even within specialty he is missing some vital things. And if you cant afford the go to armored jacket get even cheap armor. It vastly extends your survivability. And finally a combat knife is very easily concealed allowing you to remain armed even if you cant brandish a katana about. And they are cheap and powerful too.,Shadowrun,cna4uwx,1,t5_2s4v2

2789375,0,t1_cnkwtl1,Thats a big assumption.In the previous versions of Shadowrun they made a big deal out of storage space. But specifically in SR theyve chosen to ignore how much you can save at once. You may be limited to how much you can run but storage is hardly a consideration. Datachips are more for handing off data than for extra space.So I wouldnt assume that anyone has to redownload their avatar from anywhere after the first install. And I really dont think performing Change Icon over huge swaths of the general public is going to happen.Now what you could do in a much more drawn out manner would be to hack things like Electrochromatic surfaces clothes billboards etc and start piping out messages that way. The book does mention that people could become walking billboards and presumably some people would volunteer if they received some kind of royalties. I know Ive heard of people getting brand names tattooed and the company pays them to be a walking advertisement.So if in your game this is a common occurrence then you could hack whatever is sending out those advertisements and get the same result.

2937467,0,t3_2tsfr5,The matrix is best thought of as something layered on top of the real world rather than its own thing. Everything on the matrix represents something physical except for weird stuff like dataservers that dont even have rules yet anyway.In that sense it is best to think of decking as two classic psychic powers Telekenesis and telepathy. Deckers do not go into a fantasy world to battle other deckers though that often happens as a side thing. The objective rarely lies entirely on the matrix.Instead deckers go into the matrix to read an enemys mind Snoop enemy com chatter or to control the game world through pseudo telekenesis by doing things like opening and just as importantly closing and sealing doors or running people over with parked cars. Remember that anything people regularly use is almost certainly wireless and more stuff is unprotected than protected.There are run objectives that are mostly matrix based. You can make it so the PCs have to steal or edit a file but I dont recommend doing this until you are comfortable with the matrix rules. The matrix is now wired enough into the core system that you dont really need to go out of your way to make content for it so much as remember it is there.Also do not be surprised if your teams decker reacts to seeing a spider by going Nope and just not engaging him. Matrix combat tends to be extremely suboptimal and mostly based around denying your opponent the right to do anything. If you want an epic matrix kung fu fight you probably will be dissapointed as most runner teams will try to assassinate a spider so that the decker maintains complete dominance over the airwaves.

Spend it elsewhere and the first time the GM says So what are you doing you can say Im compiling and registering Sprites. Bam! Done for free.

3300301,0,t3_2xy3j1,I dont see how that makes things worse. In my opinion different levels are just a kind of flavour to your game. Obviously your GM will adjust your enemies level as much so you it might feel like playing a low level campaign. The other way around I dont see how playing normal level would be an impediment either. Again it is just how epic you want your game to be. You should just straight forward talk to him about how YOU FEEL you want to play normal level. Oh and before I forget You can always leave out some aspects like magic the matrix or anything your group or GM feels you are not up to. On ANY level of characters. And on top you cn go rules lite to make the jump into Shadowrun easy as possible.,Shadowrun,cp4glhb,1,t5_2s4v2

3354294,0,t1_cpafrv7,Well Necromancy IS present its a big school of metamagical initiation with multiple rituals and such tied to it. In Shadowrun its just not really about the kind of classical DampD Necromancy where you raise corpses to do work for you.Here is the fluff text about them from e Street Grimoiresorry about formatting of the block of text dont know how to smartly do paragraphsgt Necromancy is not the same as the wizards bringing back the dead as shown in the trids. Only the gamemaster and burning ones Edge can do that. Necromancy is the power and understanding of magic to resonate in human remains and bring forth memories within the bones. The art derives from shamanic rituals for speaking to ones ancestors but many traditions frown upon it for philosophical and ethical reasons. Necromancy can often be mistaken for blood magic especially with rituals like Blood Sight and items like the Hand of Glory. However necromancy is only interested in aspects after life not to use life as fuel for magic. Regardless its not commonly practiced and few magicians accept practitioners of necromancy. Those who practice necromancy are known as necromancers though shamanic traditions favor the ancient Babylonian term manzazuu since its sounds less negative.Only magicians who can summon spirits of man can practice necromancy as the magician must understand the various virtues and fundamentals of humankind. Lawenforcement officials often have provisions to allow forensic thaumaturgists to follow this path of learning for professional reasons. Necromancys darker connotations can quickly lead a magician down a path of blood magic so corporations and law enforcement often require necromancers to take routine psychological evaluations.Very few schools teach necromantic courses let alone help students initiate in the art. Loyola University in New Orleans has one of the few official Forensic Thaumaturgy degrees that offers necromancy initiation and certification. Necromancy classes teach a lot of history and human anatomy. At Loyola students must study human remains and identify the cause of death both from scientific observation and by speaking with the bones. A knowledge of all aspects of death is key to necromancy. Students learn both past and present burial and funeral ceremonies from across the globe. The first ritual necromancers learn is Grave Bindingp.  so that the dead can rest in peace. Necromancers commonly use reagents from the nightshade family which includes belladonna and tomatoes so this may be why they are mistakenly called veneficior poisoners.,Shadowrun,cpam4fq,6,t5_2s4v2

3376177,0,t3_2ytl40,The AAA corps only have each other as peers at the level they live at. And its not a static level Corporations from B all the way up to AAA fight tooth and nail to rise up the rankings and the AAAs are at the top of that struggle. Whatever else they may be theyre the collective entities that have excelled at this competition.    They can only do that by being ruthless and devious and they only maintain that status by being ruthless and devious. Its not a hard thing to lose AAA status and that comes with privileges that are more valuable than any principles. So no matter what character a megacorp would like to embody it has to be colored with the bloodthirstyness that makes a forerunner in corporate conflict. In that way theyre all cut from the same cloth.    When a corp betrays you when they come after your family when they kill their own people when they spin the truth and hide the tragedy its not personal. Theyre not doing it to relish your pain and oppress. Theyre just playing the game and youre not the one theyre playing against just another piece on the board.

Company B does not currently own these shares. No problem.. Company A suffers from flooding their shares plummet.. Company B snaps up loads of shares at bottom of the market  way lower than what they promises to sell them for.. Time comes for Company B to sell the shares they promises at the earlier higher market rate. They bought these for far less. They make a healthy profit.Tadah!

4719543,0,t1_ctpc5c7,The point youre making is actually adressed by the th edition ruleset. th edition was a bit wonky in that regard you could actually start as the top in your field there but th specifically prevents that. Best case scenario youre  of the way to the peak ability in that particular field.    Also Im pretty sure theres literally noone in the shadowrun universe who can waltz into a Mitsuhama ZeroZone laughing the whole way. At least not someone who isnt a dragon or works for MCT. Anyone else even the absolute best of the best is going to have to plan and gear up properly before going in and even thats not going to give them a  success rate. Thats kind of the point of shadowrun and why shadowrunners even exist in the first place. There is no defense that is  perfect but at the same time theres no  perfect way to walk INTO a facility. And in that area of uncertainty is where shadowrunners thrive.    Another important part of shadowrun is that teams are generally composed of several specialists. There are very few teams that are made of  mages that can also do a bit of decking shooting and sneaking on the side. Theres usually a decker a mage a sneaky person and someone to murder people when things go wrong. And thats why you want your characters to be specialised you want them to be good at what they do because with the possible exception of combat you dont have a good fallback. If your deckers has to bust open a missioncritical door and fries his brain on the black ICE in the system youre fucked. If your sneak gets caught halfway through a vent and riddled with bullets youre fucked.

I can only think back on how many times I couldnt remember a rule and had to break out the book even as an experienced player.I still think its easiest to limit options and do a simple ganger style campaign and branch out later. He could add magic but it will definitely make the game tougher to run. It is important to remember too that the GM should have a good understanding of the game in order for it to run smoothly.

Your character that could get away with lower skills because he had edge to use isnt quite so good when his effectiveness is cut in half because hes escaped death  times. Thats not even mentioning the other problems he has from negs other people have mentioned.  Thats assuming he doesnt get retired  because hes spending a few years in a x with Bubba.  Basically the way I look at it anyone burning edge should either have gotten seriously unlucky on a roll and be burning edge to fix that or be taking a hard look at whethe it fits their character to continue on.  If youre having issues other than that I think you need to take a look at your players and discussing it not imposing a harsh penalty simply because you think it could be abused.,Shadowrun,ctx38sw,3,t5_2s4v2
4785369,0,t3_3gfqmo,I would say that around four is still pretty normal three is where you would start feeling different. At three youd start being less emotional and start becoming a little impersonal but still normal. Some people may pick up that you feel a little... off. At two youd be getting into soulless territory start losing friends very few emotions and people would be put off by you a sort of sixth sense telling them that youre not normal.At one youd be almost a machine start going into cyberpsychosis and only feeling the extremes of emotions. Youd be devoid of any love and anything that makes you a human being. You could even lose contacts as people start to clearly avoid you and its pretty obvious despite your normal appearance that theres something deeply wrong about you.Less than one Essence and youre certifiably insane the only emotions remaining would be anger and the joy of killing perhaps not even that. Youd have no hope of any kind of social interaction besides scaring people and small children would burst into tears at the sight of you. You are no longer human and you would cease to care and know what it meant.

4785424,0,t3_3gfqmo,. is mechanically where you start seeing results ... but the net mechanical effect from . to . is lowering your social limit by .There isnt a set point at which you gain any given psychosis. cyber superhuman etc Its expected that the lower you are and the less well adjusted  supported you are otherwise the easier it is to lose a sense of being part of society. From there it just snowballs.Cyberpsychosis needs . essence lost to augmentations but the greater requirement imho is that you stop considering how others feel and are unable to regain that empathy. ie you need the Antipathy negative quality Thats something you or the GM can gauge a character by.gt ... despite all the hype that cyberpsychosis getsin the press the actual number of such incidents has been remarkably low. Sure sociopathic tendencies can result from the senseof empowerment and invincibility that comes with extensive augmentations just as heavy mods can spur an increased sense ofalienation and detachment from everyday reality and metahumanity.

4798182,0,t1_ctzaq6j,Well I actually gave math and an argument.  Your argument is complex forms are super powerful except Fading which you dont address at all.  And sprites are super powerful at hacking except they arent.  Theyre like an Agent because you cant Register the big ones because nothing ADDS to registering except skill  res and then you only get a very tiny amount of services for several days of bed rest from physical drain.Suppression helps against IC not against enemy deckers.  There are severe logistical issues to deploying a crack sprite repeatedly if youre going through multiple mid or low rating Hosts.  Every sprite that isnt a machine sprite is a Diagnostics buff youre missing out on.  Etc.You also completely ignore that that decker gets all those dice with  skill points around k of gear and  attribute points.  Your complex form using techno has spent more than him in terms of priority order.  A full priority C at least on Resonance  skill points registering compiling software at least  attribute points WIL and LOG for amount of registered sprites.  And hes worse at hacking.  By far.  The decker can hit up any number of commlinks while looking for info.  He can go into hosts willy nilly.  He can murder devices or people all day.  The Techno has to get their ducks in a row summon up their registered dudes order them then send them home when theyre done and is personally only useful if he takes a bunch of stun damage from using a complex form.  The decker has an army and is personally an unfindable matrix ninja for less cost in chargen resources.  More flexibility more power for cheaper.If you want to argue this point actually use some numbers thanks.  Ive supplied numbers and a logical framework of how they would be used various types of hosts ability to do lots of hacking ability in combat and to be undetected.

4824362,0,t1_cu2g5z4,Sorry this is actually not true.If a camera is slaved to a Host you do NOT need to log into the host to hack the camera.Hacking into the host makes hacking the camera much easier because at that point you will be considered Direct Connected to all slaved devices. Thus if you hack a camera youd just be rolling against the Cameras DR which will be  or .If you were not logged into the host and you saw a camera you could attempt to hack it but youd be rolling against the full rating of the Host instead of the cameras DR making the test MUCH harder.Of course you could also take out you Hardware toolkit and remove the casing to direct connect to the CAMERA. That would allow you to roll against the cameras DR without the trouble of logging into the Host. In this fashion any Marks youd get against the camera would translate to marks against the Host making your life easier in the future.Secondly concerning the Archive if you just have SR anything in the Archive cannot be hacked out. So as a GM Id recommend either going with encrypted files rating  to  for sensitive data.If you get Data Trails then there are new rules for hacking the Archive.

4839879,0,t3_3h61ih,The first thing you should do is probably figure out what sort of a mage you want to play. Are you going to focus on being really good in certain situations or try to generalize and have a little of everything? Im going to jot down a few thoughts on each of the schools and let you decide.Combat as uTyrhaynes suggested its good to get both an indirect and direct combat spell. This gives you something good to cast at pretty much anyone. AoE spells I may or may not get depending on how combat heavy I want to focus but I also like to get a stunbolt. Sometimes you want to take someone down without killing them. Extractions or maybe just to pump them for information.Detection Can be quite handy but for many theres often alternatives. A lot of the astral stuff I find a bit redundant because you can astrally project and find out a lot of it so long as youre confident you can slip through any barriers that get put up. Theres also other ways to do some of the clairvoyant recon drones and hacking etc.. Mind spells can be very strong but abusing them can rack up the infamy so people wont trust your character so its a mixed bag.Health Some focus on being a medic and take a lot of these but usually Ill at least take a couple from here because theres some really great stuff. Awakens nice for getting your troll buddy up because youre not going to have the Str to drag his ass back to extraction but so can a good stim patch. Youre definitely going to want Heal as it lets you double up healing attempts. IncreaseDecrease Reflexes is great for buffingdebuffing an allyopponent to control their effectiveness.Illusion These spells can be a lot of fun and help you get in or out of trouble. They can serve as a nice distraction or if you need to get away having the illusion of a troll with a minigun laying down suppressive fire as you run can do wonders until they figure it out. Im a big fan of Chaotic World. Being able to incapacitate or reduce the  of hits your opponents are getting so you can do your thing and get out without too high a body count can keep your heat from getting unmanageable. Theres also some great infiltration stuff with invisibility and blocking sound. Being able to walk into an office throw up a soundbarrier and take a guy down without the rest of the building knowing sure can be helpful.Manipulation I like control pack turning a pack of hell hounds around to your side whether its to get past or just flip the tables is a nasty surprise. Levitate can come in handy as can the barrier spells especially if you want to focus on combat. Theres a lot of controller stuff here a manipulation mage can really be powerful. But if theres only one spell you take here Sterilize at the scene of fights before you move on can destroy all that nasty dna you leave laying around the place.Rituals Wards and Circle of Healing can come in handy and earn you some cash on the side as a day job cover. Watchers can also be useful especially if you want to send a message or recon somewhere without going there yourself.Apologies on the wall of text hope it doesnt turn you off.,Shadowrun,cu4ls5h,2,t5_2s4v2
4848754,0,t3_3haldi,Depends If youre doing a Burst that is a simple action then you can aim and then burst aiming resets you recoil.If you have one of the guns that only lets you burst as a complex action then youre in trouble. In that case the recoil continues to accumulate.In your example the first round is  the second is . But that only works if your second simple action in the first round is the burst and the first simple action in the second round is the burst. The third round in this case would be back to  because the second simple action in the second round would automatically reset the recoil. This is all assuming youre not using complex bursts.The question really is is the cost of the Gas Vent R worth the dice it will save me when I burst? Of course maybe youd prefer a silencer over a gas vent so theres that too.Anyway decent example on page  of the core book.,Shadowrun,cu5pz90,1,t5_2s4v2

This is actually part of its charm in my opinion because it lets you set very granular targets on things provided your players brought enough  siders.e days had the best overall storyline stuff in my opinion and its been a very mixed bag since then. The gt timeline changes have not done much for the game which felt best in that early s view of the future it had and trying to rationalize that versus actual technological developments killed a lot of the charm.e was an attempt to clean up e by different writers.e has all the complexity of e but none of the fixes and suffered from some highly abusable mechanics around skill checks.e is closely related to e but not as streamlined when the fixed target number of  was introduced as well as wireless.If you want to run a game with zero prior experience e is the way to go. ,Shadowrun,cuc63vk,5,t5_2s4v2

An example is slaving an Avalon to a deck with high firewall but then slaving a gun to the Avalon which has higher firewall than the gun does. Drones have intense combat limitations that mean even if you could have  and they all cost nothing when you lost them there would be still be limitations that would make the sam superior to the drones.

Its pretty expensive to get a highForce lodge and this will make one almost required to do some solid alchemy. I would go with no more than Force preparations which are all less than Force Force. Your second point  are you basically saying that you dont roll when you activate  you just take the potency and make that the number of successes you get? I like that. Its different and reliable. Can I do one combat and one noncombat preparation per turn? With my other suggestion for Alchemical Storage you can store Force    Initiate Grade preparations of no greater than Force. That would be really solid. Alchemical Master is both overpowered and underpowered. I dont think its needed with some twisting of the triggers from Street Grimoire.All in all decent first stab.

5358145,0,t3_3odque,Caution Incoming wall of text from a thread I posted in before...The big things that make a Rigger are the Control Rig implant a fancy Datajack and the Rigger Control Console RCC a fancy Cyberdeck.Mechanically... the only thing you gain from using a Control Rig is An extra state of being online. Offline  AR  VR  Jumped In. So it takes that much longer to get ready or to get clear if youre at risk of Dumpshock. You treat Vehicle actions as Matrix actions so the  for Hot Sim applies. The limits of your Vehicle actions as well as the Thresholds are modified by the rating of the Control Rig .  of any damage the vehicle  drone suffers while youre Jumped In hits you as Biofeedback. ColdSim  Stun HotSim  Physical. Matrix damage targeted at the vehicle  drone youre Jumped Into affects you  your RCC instead of the drone itself. So you save the drone from getting bricked by getting yourself bricked instead.These are the only things you gain from using a Control Rig... Thematically you get to become the vehicle you experience life running down the highway at  mph blah blah blah. But thats all just fluff. From a game mechanics standpoint you really dont gain much and you suffer damage when your drone body gets shot up or someone plays bumper cars with your getaway van.Whereas... Any hacker can go into VR and basically experience life from the drones perspective. They wont become the drone but they could be surrounded by floating viewscreens of all the drone sensory data. You can use Control Device to give the drone all the same Vehicle commands as a Rigger would and if youre HotSim youd still get the  bonus. You dont get the bonuses to Limits or Thresholds. Any damage the drone suffers doesnt hurt you in the slightest. Maybe you have a life bar like a video game and when the drone dies then the words GAME OVER float before your eyes. But since you werent inside the drone then you dont suffer Dumpshock when it explodes from gunfire.Now...I didnt mention the RCC yet bc pretty much all of its functions work whether youre a hacker with drones or a Rigger with implant. If youre a Rigger networking your drones through the RCC you can transition from inside one drone directly into another with a single action. Without an RCC if you were networking your drones through a Commlink or something youd have to spend one action to get out and another action to get into the next. For any user you can issue a single command to all the drones networked through an RCC at once. Instead of saying Rotodrone A attack. Rotodrone B attack. Lynx A attack. Lynx B attack eating up actions with each order you can say Attack and all the drones receive it at once. For any user the RCC can boost Noise reduction to make controlling drones over great distances easier. You can make an Electronic Warfare check to temporarily boost the Noise reduction. For any user the RCC can share out a single copy of Autosofts to all applicable drones. Instead of installing  copies of RotoDrone Maneuvering into each one you put out a single copy to all  at once. Since all the drones are Slaved to the RCC they are all protected by the RCCs Firewall.All of these functions aside from fast transitions are available to anyone with an RCC even a hacker who just happens to own some drones.,Shadowrun,cvwkaqs,2,t5_2s4v2

5406477,0,t3_3p1m61,I was the GM for a game with one player character named Limwen. She recently had hired one of my old Prime runner charactersturnedGMPCs Rin Fancypants Valyrin to do an investigation on her mother who she suspected had ties to an underground live snuff performance ring. Not only was her mother connected but she had also quite literally killed Rin a year prior in one of her performances yes he got better. Long story..Well shit went down when Rin started his investigation. Long story short he planned on capping Limwens mother himself as revenge but a hitman hired by the rest of the snuff ring got to her first in order to keep her from outing the rest of the organization. Rin ended up buried under a few feet of rubble when he brought down the performance hall around his ears and the ears of the pissedoff bodyguards with a huge Blast spell. After spending some time in traction thanks to Doc Wagon he went back to his favorite club and got stonecold drunk to cope.Limwen came looking for him. When she found him Rin was feeling particularly fatalistic and told her the entire story top to bottom.She replied by swinging her tiny furious elf fist into his face.I rolled Rins dodge and got a crit glitch meaning that Rin got hit HARD. She broke a Prime Runners nose and very nearly knocked him out in one single shot.

5551635,0,t3_3r5zx1,Healing becomes perminant after a number of rounds not passes equal to the boxes healed. So you can sacrifice the amount of healing to heal faster. When a magician or shamen casts a spell the limit of successes on the casting check is the force at which it is cast. So if Mage is going to heal their buddy and casts heal at force  they can only count  successes. Even if  dice are s only  successes count. This is good because drain is based on these successes. Casting at force higher than ones Magic rating causes the drain to be physicalHere is the interesting part. If you choose to preedge a roll the limit goes away so if you cast at force  used edge and got  successes now you heal  boxes but since the successes exceeded the magic rating even casting low force the drain is still physical.

5813519,0,t1_cxhfjdo,Social tests are the one type of test that are hard to just roll away. If a player doesnt know how to operate a computer well in real life you can just say your character would know this and move on telling them what to roll as appropriate. But turning what could be an epic dramatic roleplay encounter into an extended test and being forced to describe to the autistic nerd who you know couldnt spit out a coherent sentence if they tried about how their super suave babemagnet totally charmed everyone while they masturbate under the table to their optimized dicepools and image of their character in their head?Its not fair. Social rolls have almost no rules. Its not like combat hacking or magic where you can effectively wait for the GM to tell you what to roll and what the appropriate skill is. You have to rely less on optimized dice pools and more on roleplaying ability and fluid narrative thinking. Thats the tradeoff of having the simplest role imo. I mean you expect the street sam to know their shit when it comes to combat mechanics so why wouldnt you expect the face to know something about roleplaying and communication?,Shadowrun,cxhpz9z,2,t5_2s4v2

5826106,0,t3_3uzj1i,This is a thing that always bugged me about the canon  they have real cartels like La Cosa Nostra and the Vory they mention the Big megacorps buying out real companies but then they make up fake gangs.I prefer to use some real gangs a few new ones and update it for the timeline.  With all the upheaval of the Awakening if the mafia is still around why arent inner city gangs like the Bloods and Crips?  or highway er outlaw biker clubs like the Hells Angels or Sons of Silence or Outlaws?  It seems like they would lock down their territories even more viciously in that time.One of my updates was a merger between Bloods and Crips based on the truce while Tupac was around.  I call them the OGSCs Original Gangsta Shot Callers.  They still have their cliques some wear red some wear blue they even have inhouse rivalries but they team up against any outsiders challenging their rights.  I also like to include some Haitian Dominican gangs some chromedout skinhead neonazis some antifa SHARPs and so on.For the er biker clubs they do what theyve always done.  They have a clubhouse in a town heavily fortified with cameras steel gates and guns and inside they throw parties with lots of booze drugs and strippers.  Otherwise they go on rides as a group to various meetups with other regional chapters of their club or to the funerals of dead members or to biker rallies or whatever.  Most of them have done some jail time have blue collar jobs as mechanics electricians or construction guys and make extras by running drugs and guns between cities on their rides.  When two clubs come into conflict theyll settle it as easily by brawling with knives and clubs to shootings and ambushes to straightup bombing another clubs clubhouse.  Due to their often interstate crimes they fall under the scrutiny of the FBI and the ATF Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and are typically brutal with informers.,Shadowrun,cxjbte8,3,t5_2s4v2
5839526,0,t1_cxl1p2j,Step right up folks step right up and see what FederatedBoeing has to offer. Right here parked on the tarmac with its teeth bared is the Merlin IV Ground Assault Helicopter.  Folks if youre on a limited budget but need some muscle for CoIn operations look no further  the Merlin is your bird.  You might look at this beast and wonder whats a helicopter need with those big wings and friend on an ordinary helicopter youd be right.  But on the Merlin they serve an important function Carrying more ordinance than your average close support jet and giving the helo enough lift to bring it all to bear almost as fast as a jet.In the center chin position  this is all optional by the way but our lovely and talented sales reps can help you to configure your Merlin IVtm to your needs  we have a long range laser illuminator to assist your forces in putting guided strikes where they need to go.  Mounted next to it is a coaxial AresStoner LMG.  Why? because this bad boy can move so much metal we figured why not! Never hurts to have area suppression capability and  rounds of belt feed ensures you can keep suppressing.  Next to that in the number one and two position on the wings are a pair of Panther XL rotary assault cannons.  Each gun has  degrees of independent traverse and  rounds of ammunition on a belt feed system.  Theyre normally keyed to the operators view focus but they can be manually configured to specific directions and targets for special purposes.  Strafing a hardened target has never been so easy!But guns dont always get the job done do they folks? No thats why the Merlin IV comes standard with the BattleScout OverTheHill sensor system mounted right there above the rotors.  With the BattleScout OTH Systemtm the operator of the Merlin needs not expose himself to the enemy to get a good idea of whats going on out of his line of sight.  Combining RADAR LIDAR and optical observation systems he can collect an accurate picture of the battlefield with none the wiser and then pop up use that image and unleash the Ares DRAGONFIREtm AntiArmor Guided Missiles in the number three and four positions on the wing.  Each of these babies may be a little pricey but if youll refer to the screen to your right I think youll agree theyre worth every single last nuyen cost.  Look at that.  A single DRAGONFIREtm placed properly can disable the mobility system of a Stonewall MBT and in  of cases trigger a catastrophic event in the crew compartment.  Two hits gives you a  kill rate against Stonewall class MBTs some restrictions may apply.And last but not least on the wingtip locations are the Ares AimX Rattler airtoair missiles.  Because its not worth sending an expensive close support unit into battle if theyll be taken out by the first flight of interceptors that looks their way  no friends what we have here is the reason why the interceptors will look for other targets first.  The Rattler is really almost more of a drone friends.  Its a smart missile.  In its first mode of activation the pilot need only look at the target and the helmetactivated haptics integrated with the BattleScout Systemtm will lock the missile onto your target and after that just fire and forget  the missile will keep pursuing its target until the missile is out of propellant or the targets a cloud of smoke.  But the second mode folks the second mode is where the magic is.  Any of you combat pilots have experience flying in combat situations? You sir? UCAS Air Cav? Good for you sir! I salute your service! You would certainly know that in the heat of combat tracking dozens of ground hostiles and maintaining your air space can get awful distracting and complicated and thats what the second mode on the Rattler system is there for.  Ares took the fireandforget concept to the next level when they made this one folks.  Just enable and launch the missile and after it leaves the rails it will assume a hover mode just balancing on its motor over there on the left hand monitor all kinds of graceful really while it acquires a target.  See the drone brain in this missile will be loaded with your designated list of friendlies and foes and once its activated in mode  itll go up search for foe signatures and take off after the closest one.  After that I think you know what happens.  All the operator needs to do is authorize the launch its that easy folks.  AiMX Rattler one of the best close range air defense systems you can get.The last thing I want to talk about before I start talking questions and I know youre gonna have em is probably what the gentleman from the Air Cav is wondering  its a helicopter so wheres the tail rotor? how does it avoid just spinning like a top? Well the answer to that is jets.  Im not kidding folks Jets are the answer.  The dark section at the tip of the tail? Those are the jet louvres that apply counterrotational force but not only that because the louvres can be opened from any direction they give the Merlin IV its legendary aerial agility.  Folks what you have here is a one of a kind ground attack tool with the agility to dance ballet in the sky and the payload to make your enemies think twice about tangling with you.Alright folks you got questions and I wanna answer them.,Shadowrun,cxl37fl,11,t5_2s4v2

And it had this turning key so you could match up your car against the key and see what roll you needed to make or else you would skid out of control...  Man that was a fun game.Edit  Oh yeah it had rules where you won some money in each game and you could spend the money to buy clones for your driver.  Your driver had a driving and a gunnery skill that went up and spending money on clones was a way to save your progress?Edit  I havent thought about this in decades.  It had a rough setting where Crazy Al won a demolition derby by mounting a . cal machine gun on his car and somehow created a business out of that meanwhile WWIII happened...  so in the setting the main thing was cars fighting on the highway ?!? in some vague Mad Max continuity.  Your driver had two stats and a health score.  You could buy body armor and personal weapons just in case your car got destroyed.  And you could buy clones.  The main thing was starting in a compact car and upgrading to a luxury or sports car.

6120560,0,t1_cylbim5,Alright lets have a crack!     Im pretty sure that you cannot have a Host within a Host. I cant recall if there is a specific rule for it but there are no rules for subhosts and it just doesnt really make sense. The main conflict you end up with is the same as the PAN conflict. This is where people ask if you can slave a gun to a commlink and then slave the commlink to a deck. I dont think there is a specific rule saying you cant but the general agreement is that you are not able and having a subhost would be the same thing but with WANs. Really if you want something like that just use multiple Hosts. Many corps might do something like that if they have really valuable data on one host and just the cameras or whatever on another.     Ok so what Patrol IC actually does is always a pain and something Id need to spend a fair while looking into but Data Trails managed to work it down to a mechanical logic. So Patrol IC looks for people running silent or scans for the Attack attribute which most people shouldnt have or validates their icon against the Database of People not to kill. Data Trails explains that the bigger the Host rating the less frequent you are directly targeted by Patrol IC when they meander around scanning. So mechanically if you are running silent you have X turns until you need to dodge a Perception test but you will be safe until then. However the big problem I see is if you ARENT running silent. Because if you have the correct mark you should be ok to wander around. Hiding in plain sight and all that. Im not sure but the way I will run it is that it is the same as running silent aka X turns and then resist a scan but they are just checking off your ID or something. The main difference would be when dealing with other personas especially spiders. A  or deal with the spider thinking something is up?     Ok as a note a PAN doesnt work like a Host. So yes the decker could see those icons. The disadvantage to slaving devices isnt as bad in a PAN compared to a WAN but of course a Decker doesnt really want to have someone getting free marks on their deck. However the PAN would give those guns extra dice to hide from said Perception check but wouldnt shield them like a host. ,Shadowrun,cylcelt,3,t5_2s4v2

6212455,0,t3_40j9z4,I have just finished running the Season  convention missions for my players. They are written in E but we played in E. There were stat conversions which were made easier by a couple of resources I found. I am wholly unfamiliar with E but I imagine the conversion is going to be no more difficult.That being said I had to do conversions UP and then BACK DOWN from  to  and that was exhausting for all NPCs. Thresholds and challenges and damage had also all changed and I had to entirely adapt those from scratch so all security devices and weapons were converted to what I found to be their closest analogs.The worst issue which I didnt always have the foresight to correct in certain places was anachronisms between the E and E settings. It sounds like you are aware of yours but Im fairly certain E was preCrash . my history lore is quite lacking unfortunately which means that ALL SECURITY required DNI and my players with wireless hacking could easily bypass most of the missions. Additional anachronisms included companies that no longer exist big NPC characters that have died or gone missing etc.It was easier to handwave flavor details that were out of place and you may find that also works if you dont want to rewrite the plot to fit E.tldr The best bet would probably be to convert as many numbers as possible first then grab analogs for anything that needs one with a full rewrite in places that cant be fixed by the first two solutions.,Shadowrun,cyvsf98,1,t5_2s4v2

6397839,0,t1_czgv182,Yeah Sammies you got the lingo right in Shadowrun or at least Shadowrun the way I play it tend to be Plan B. When the face gets called out when the Decker gets caught when someone realizes Kansas City is in Missouri thats when the sammy shines and boy does he shine. Unfortunately when that isnt happening he relies on his other skills be they infiltration intimidation or magic to help the party which for pure sammies can be a problem because they can get bored. With only two people and one playing a pure sammy youre games are pretty certain to be a lot more explosive than mine usually are. That isnt a bad thing just a very different way to play thatll require your GM to think outside the box a little bit. In this case a rigger is actually a perfect choice since they can fill dozens of bit roles including infiltration and data gathering. ,Shadowrun,czgva0i,3,t5_2s4v2
6400661,0,t3_43ae1b,gt Greetings everyone. Ive been lurking around this subreddit for a while for informationinspiration but otherwise Im brandnew to Shadowrun and even newer to Reddit so bear with me.Welcome to the shadows of reddit.  gtgt Some background Ive been playing DampD for the last  years give or take and thats the only RP system Ive ever used albeit  different editions of it. This is also the first thing Ive ever posted to Reddit so I hope I didnt break something.So far so good on the posting.   years of DampD is commendable especially playing through th ed when so many people didnt like it.gt Ive been deciphering SR which may very well be a capital offense on informative layouts since the end of November last year and came to the conclusion its an awesome game that Id like to try and convince my group to switch to. This is currently already in processIt is an awesome game that does indeed suffer from layout issues.  Give them a little slack though they arent FASA.  Nobody is FASA any more sadly.gt However. Ive run into a problem that worries me. The beautiful thing about Shadowrun is that youre given a lot of freedom agency and room for creativity in how you wish to tackle challenges. In my experience thats also the reason a lot of things break. Having had no experience with this system having never actually played it I cant tell what the system can and cannot handle. Just because something you can build is technically legal by RAW doesnt mean it wont just break the whole system.Yup the whole anyone can be anything thing is great.  The advantage is also a means of hanging ones self.  If you spread too quickly you find yourself a jack of all trades master of none.  Without mastery over at least some gimmick youre not often going to get to the next pay day.  Make sure your players know that some versatility is good but a slew of s and s is going to get them nowhere fast.gt Examples weve found in short order  A character that can casually punch through reinforced bunkers.  A character that is invisible  of the time.  A character that never needs to be physically present to do anything.  A character that is unfazed by anything short of antitank missile volleys.As bamce has mentioned many times anyone who can punch through walls will eventually find themselves punching plasteel reinforced walls possibly bolstered by magic since people with that kind of rep will often be sent on more...  aggressive runs.  Or used as distraction duty while a real team breaks in silently in the confusion.  Or at least will find the place they punched their way into has a lot of highly trained guards on duty with orders to shoot on sight.As was also mentioned invisibility is worthless when astral perception comes into play.  All magic and indeed all living things give off an aura on the astral plane.  Sustained magic just happens to shine brightly.  This means that to anything capable of perceiving the astral plane dual natured creatures spirits magicians and adepts with the power purchased will see some idiot nonchalantly walking across an open courtyard asking to be interrogated by bullets.The character that doesnt have to physically be present part is a bit of an up in the air thing.  Deckers often do their best work remotely.  However some systems are still legacy and arent open to wireless hacking necessitating direct access to a system somewhere seriously banks still use Fortran.  There are very few Fortran programmers left in the world.  You can bet that there are organisations in the future who wouldnt have upgraded to  wireless matrix access when  minute hard line windows are more than enough.  Likewise riggers with their potential armada of drones are still subject to noise too many wireless ads in the future or active jamming requiring an onsite presence to counteract the noise.  Mages can astrally project and scout out buildings that arent built with natural materials river stones bushes acting as living walls for some inner sanctuary etc. but they cant actually do anything to affect the physical world.And characters that can eat rockets for breakfast are two things  Extremely obvious and usually weak willed.  You very very rarely encounter a magician who is also a street samurai wandering into the thick of battle with heavy milspec armour making him resistant to both spells and bullets.  Your average street samurai doesnt invest highly in the stats required to resist spells.  Even if they did theyre dramatically more vulnerable to a mana spell than a rocket.  Theres honestly very few ways to make a high strength manabolt go away.  All a mage needs is line of sight.  Binoculars from an HTR response VTOL some km away is enough to roast someone.  gt Are these okay to play? I cant tell. Interesting for certain but they feel more like thought experiments and while it seems like it might be fun to try and play one of those for how long?gt TLDR Where should I draw the line? At what point does a character concept stop being fun to play? Where does the system break itself?Going back to that extremely obvious part Shadowrun is a world of duality.  In DampD its just accepted that there are people running about in armour.  Shits scary out there.  You could get shanked by highwaymen or eaten by trolls.  You dont travel unarmed or unguarded and thats what the players are for.  In Shadowrun though youre in a city.  A city with real people.  Not just a city but a thriving metropolis with millions of people and the means to protect itself from the encroachment of the paranatural hellhounds are captured and trained as guard dogs for corps for example.  They dont wander the countryside terrorising the populous.  Normally.  If you were to see someone walking down the street looking like some anime reject or with more gun than Neo from The Matrix you would avoid them at all costs and probably call the cops.  Sure Mr. I can take a tank shell will survive said tank shell but can he avoid being pestered by the local rentacops on his way to that date?  Will he even be able to hide again after being so obvious and being tailed all over the city?  Theyll certainly be a warning for the corp youre trying to run against meaning their HTR teams will be en route if not already on site.Shadowrun is about doing a thing and doing it well.  But its also about subtly in a world where the common person is likely your enemy if youre obvious.  Being a master with a pistol is great.  You can sneak guns into everywhere almost.  Being a master sniper is by contrast very difficult to get by as unless youre on the corps side with permits.  Having a person with a silver tongue smooth things over and coerce information from people so the others have a leg up on the run is a must.  But if everyone lacks the basic social graces to pass as normal theyre going to stand out right away anyway.  Abuse their lack of metahumanity if they forget their Etiquette skills and treat Charisma as a dump stat.  Make them suffer for it before giving them the scenario theyve built for.  Make it impossible to get their big ol weapons into the run because they dont have the skills to properly conceal weapons.  But most of all make sure they know at character creation that everyone is going to be part bard or will suffer for it.  gtgt Perhaps the best question there is how many dice is too many? But Im not sure thats even how it works. Some insights from more experienced players would be welcome. DampD is boring enough because I cant do anything without breaking it. I was hoping Shadowrun was a bit more... flexible?How many dice is too many?  Youre looking at ish dice possible to start with and it just goes up from there.  Considering an average thats  successes.  Your average street thug might not be much of a threat but remember that the guards theyre going up against will be roughly as competent ish dice.  Theyre trained well just not augmented.  Consider also that the Mr. Johnson whos hiring the team is going to give them runs suitable for their expertise.  Got a team heavy with magic?  Theyre going to be doing runs against magically protected enclaves.  Got some people in the group who like to go loud in a big way?  The team might find themselves on a lot of suicide missions while a ghost team they didnt know about gets top dollar to do the job right while theyre playing the part of decoy.  How will the runners like that when they find out?  Is  dice too much?  No.  Its  dice for a specific scenario.   dice to shoot someone in the face is great in combat but when it comes time to negotiate pay and they cant negotiate because they have all of  dice base Charisma?  Thats the price theyre paying for that super specialisation.,Shadowrun,czh6ukd,1,t5_2s4v2

6437528,0,t3_43uudd,This was a background for a character I was thinking of playing...back in nd edition gtgtuozurr has your bases covered as far as Priorities and skills etc go so maybe I can help on the flavorbackground side? As he said this is absolutely a case of giving up power for versatility.One straightforward   if obvious  way to do it could be to base the character on Jake Armitage from the SNES Shadowrun game yes the same guy who shows up in the first SRR  He was a Decker who discovered that he was linked to Dog after a failed hit put him into the morgue He got better!. He found himself equipped with ...shall we say...a little bit more chiba in addition to his existing datajack and ended up becoming a fullon hybrid deckershaman with no penalties to either. I realize that this blatantly disregards how things work in well ALL SR games except for maybe Boston Lockdown  but it was a fun game and well worth looking up. Youd have to adapt him to something more realisticwithin the rules but it sets a baseline of a character who is at the beginning of his career with only the basics in shamanism Dog decking and firearms use.The way mine was set up it never saw the light of day was to have him be a former hermetic wagemage who got volunteered read gassed woke up on an operating table for a program that was designed to see if DeckerMages could be a workable corporate thing. The assumption was that the corp wanted to keep Magic loss minimal so they used the best quality chiba they could get yes the character still had to pay for the stuff to keep essence from dropping down more than one point.  This character would likely begin statted out as a typical wagemage  CorpSecurity etiquettes and Contacts some pistol skill most of his starting points into magic and into spells that his bosses required with Decking at skill  an alphaware datajack or modern edition equivalentSOTA and a decent but notbyanymeans impressive deck that still has a hidden chip in there that sends copies of any programsdata back to the home server from time to time. Hed be unlikely to even know much Decker slang at the start.If the character had remained loyal to the corp they would have eventually arranged for him to earn more cyberware under the same condition  never letting his base Magic score drop by more than one point. If he had abandoned them hed be a moderatepriority target and need to leave his home town at the very least. In this case I would have assumed that the Corp wanted their ware back by any means necessary and that the first attempt to get it back had already taken place. This would result in the newlychristened runner a having a need to infiltrate their network and have himself erased completely and b end up with a very small pool of Contacts due to his abrupt departure assume that any Corp contacts would have been warned not to aid him. He might choose to forego ANY future cyberware  or he may choose to keep with the OK to get some headware but dont let Magic drop any further idea  or he may just say Screw it let his magic go to waste because it reminds him of the Corp that betrayed him and embark on a career as a proper Decker.,Shadowrun,czl6g4p,3,t5_2s4v2

6629542,0,t1_d050yi9,It gives runners more control over the bad events deck and some ability to control the obstacles deck as well so the game becomes more about risk management and less of a math equation where you solve to see if you can handle the threat or if you lose the game.Also the dual color cards allow you more flexibility in handling obstacles which again makes it more a game about deciding what needs to be done rather than just going whelp this is  face damage so its going on thsi obstacle here because any other choice is dumb.The new roles are not super interesting they are social adepts and drone riggers and the gimmick is instead of getting  of one color and one of each of the others they go . Drone riggers are hackersamurai and social adepts are facespellcasters. Neither change the game very much riggers are worse at what they do than the single class hackers or samurai because those decks tend to be very synergy focused especially deckers. Magefaces sorta make some sense because faces often splash magic but the magic they splash is never the magic that cares about blue cards and if you need a mage with a side of face the face basic cards arent helpful and for the love of god why is the mage splashing and not the samurai into face? If you have to chose between a face and a mage pure mage is a better choice than the split by far. That said they have synergy with the new hybrid cards and maybe I am missing a way to make it work.The lower difficulty missions just make sense.

That way as a rigger if I think Im in danger of being dumped because the drone is going to be shot out from under me I can switch to it as a simple action depending on the mode Im in.  Might not be a bad Idea for an AI to have a safety bot somewhere either.Tacking on to these ideas Id also add that you or any rigger should remember to kit out the sensors on each drone.  A fleet of FlySpies circling a building is a great thing if they all have the same sensors but if each has even just one different sensor you get the benefit of a fullrange sensor net from a variety of similar shells.  You may have to cycle through them all but you increase the odds of finding something.As an example six FlySpies go for a leisurely stroll in the park.  They all spot the same troll and decide to circle him to find out if hes the same one who stole the drones owners purse.  All have a camera and Omnidirectional mics but one has a Geiger counter one has ultrasound one has an Radio Signal Scanner one has a range finder one has a MAD scanner and one has a cyber scanner.

I think I have written the equivalent of a  page essay on them by now! but even though they sit at a good power level they are still immensely frustrating to play and make without tanking your PC anyway so being liberal with diagnostics is a good way to help them stay relevant.While technos can do really cool things on the matrix the archtype struggles with as you said quality of life things off of the matrix. Without machine sprites being useful they basically cant do much of anything! So let the techomancer hack the proxy network on your Smartlinks or Coats router in order to download more harddrive space... or whatever!Is it more than the designers intended? Probably!But the golden rule of reviewing the rules is twofold Will this option make designing encounters that are exciting exact wording there! Excitement doesnt always mean challenging! too hard? And will this option be so overwhelmingly good that it forces people who didnt take this option out of the spotlight?Machine sprite diagnostics definitely isnt exactly the biggest buff for your buck at its oportunity costs and it is the antispotlight stealing power it actively makes someones big moment bigger by making it a duet. The technomancer isnt the primary actor it is still the samurai doing something insanely awesome like shooting the three badguys that are threatening to nuke the orphanage all at once but the samurai will be greatful that the techno set them up for such a cool moment and if the samurai wasnt already basically capable of doing what they wanted to do the techno wouldnt help that much anyway it is winwinwin everyone feels good and you still can present real problems to the team!Remember that each machine sprite is one of the technos registered sprites. Registering a big sprite takes a hefty amount of stun and technos struggle to get bonuses to registering meaning each technomancer is going to have fewer services on each sprite. Reregistering a big sprite is also really challenging meaning that machine sprites set to diagnose someones object is a sprite that cant be doing other things.Also remember that technos WANT sprites to be doing other things every sprite is a huge boost in power for the technomancer and allows them more active participation in the run. Machine sprites specifically serve as the technomancers only way of utilizing their powers on the physical plane either by diagnosing critical objects or by using gremlins to allow technomancers their only meatspace attack. Any sprite permanently on diagnosing duty is one that cant aid on a different critical roll or one that cant help make an entire squads worth of guns misfie to save the day.,Shadowrun,d13oke1,0,t5_2s4v2

Thats why binoculars mention having optical versions which allow spellcasting that cant take any other modifications other than vision mag and Electronic versions.No. Just because something displays things does not mean it is not transparent. The hard rule for spellcasting is that if light transmits from target to your eye and you can process it you can cast a spell at it. Period. The Difference between electronic binoculars and non electronic ones is that electronic binoculars digitize the image. The light cannot transmit from target to eye because there is a camera on one end and two screens on the other. gtIn the next section it lists Optical Devices where they specifically say that unlike the previous secion these items use optical tech instead of electronics. Which is the only way to allow spellcasting.Incorrect. The relevant sentences from that passage aregtThese devices use optical technology glass bending or reflecting light not electronics to function. They have many uses one of the most dramatic of which is that they enable a magician to obtain line of sight for spellcasting from cover something that cant be accomplished with electronic devices.There is no mention of the previous section or how they are the only way to allow spellcasting through vision devices. They are however the only way to cast spells without exposing yourself to the enemy. That is why optical devices exist. They give options to extend your line of sight. gtFor balance reasons the game dont want mages casting through vision enhancements except vision mag unless they paid the essence. This has been going on for multiple versions. Theres something about throwing holograms on your vision that fucks with spellcastings visual targeting.This is where the misunderstanding truly occurs. You cannot cast through vision enhancements. This is correct. I even wrote that myself. Vision enhancements are stuff like Thermal vision and Image Magnification. An Image is generated and overlaid onto your vision. You cannot cast spells at someone through thermal imaging if that is your only way to observe him. If you can see the dude normally but also have thermal vision installed on your glasses and probably turned off on account of duh you can cast whatever you want. Glasses and contacts are not vision enhancements. They are simply see through things that you place in front of your eyes and then possibly upgrade with vision enhancements. Vision enhancements can be turned of with a free action pg. . So even IF holograms messed with spell casting you could turn them off prior to casting.

The th layer of Dantes is Anger so i turned into a cage fight a giant center cage surrounded by smaller cages where people were beating the the hell out of each other. Added mind numbing Industrial music. Half dressed customers and staff waiting to or cheering on the fights random unsanctioned brawls in the club. A few of players wanted to enjoy the club so I gave them time after.The helicopter one was memorable because we were helpless. We were flying hundreds of feet over Berlin back in the Flux days we were a  man team with a Johnson his pilot and his bodyguard. Because of this my badfeelingometer was going off and if something happened we were screwed. None of could fly a helicopter we were out gunned. and couldnt go anywhere if something bad happened.  Why a helicopter? Whos gonna overhear you talking. I use movie references to help describe the scene like the Bar in The Departed to describe a Pub where my players were meeting a forger. The key is I guess is make your meets extravagant bordering on insane but not all of them. The you meet the johnson at a bar gets boring after a while. Meeting your Johnson at an Urban Brawl game is a little more memorable? but always have a why. Why does he want to meet here? let your players try to figure it out but never tell them.

7493190,0,t1_d2tocc4,If GMs populated the the Matrix with free and feral sprites and dissonant Resonance beings technomancers are going to be more vulnerable to them than magicians are to scary astral beings. Most technomancers dont engage in cybercombat or use the one I guess  including derezz damage dealing CF Resonance Spike. Decompiling is even more rare than Banishing.  Only one kind of sprite is able fight in the Matrix as opposed to ALL spirits in the astral. Adepts at least have access to weapon foci if it comes to it and metamagics that help them disguisehide their auras. There is no technomancer equivalent.      Magicians have spells offensive and defensive and spirits often many to deal with astral beings. Mysads too. Adepts have some options. Magicians can even take the offensive against dualnatured creatures who dont project.   And this is not counting more typical encounters from spiders and IC. Even in these situations technomancers can be pretty wrecked from nonbiofeedback damage while deckers have a lot more options to protect themselves.  As for initiative astrally projecting magicians are on par with their foes in the astral and astrally perceiving awakened benefit from their magically enhanced physical initiatives. Yes technomancers are as fast as other hotsimmers when in hotsim they dont have ways to boost their physicalAR initative in any technomancery way.

7693634,0,t3_4knkom,dont be a mysad  just be a mage or an adept but mage seems to fit the character concept.  A mysad sucks up so much karma just to keep at a decent power level that if the Karma exists the rest of your team is going to be superheros and youll be happy to get an  dice pool while they have  dice pools for their hobbies.Each net hit also gives the subject a bonus die while operating the device and allows the subject to ignore any skilldefaulting modifiers for using it as long as the spell is sustained.  This line from the analyze device spell can be OP when used properly  analyze a SMG found lying on the ground become an instant gunslinger.  This spell adds so much utility that it should be considered mandatory.A quick and dirty way to cover astral signatures is the mana static spell. It isnt as effective as erasing the signatures but it does make it harder to read them.  Also the sterilize spell makes it more difficult to use physical debris e.g. blood for tracking. Alchemy doesnt suck it is a niche style which isnt flashy requires thought and preparation to work can be hard to adjust on the fly and any resource a mage commits to alchemy is unavailable to make them a better regular mage.  Alchemy is not about making a mage better at being a mage and an enchanting mage is never going to be the equal of a spell casting mage in terms of raw power but alchemy allows nonmages to cast weak magic spells and lets an enchanting mage do things which are not in the casting mages toolbox while shifting the drain to the time of enchanting and letting the enchanted  object handle sustaining the spell.As for spirits and sustaining spells a spirit must usually remain near  the summoner and spirits sustaining spells are easier and more likely to be shut down than a focus is.  There are uses for spirit spell sustaining but most of the time a shodowruning mage is better off getting fpcii to handle sustaining spells.,Shadowrun,d3gpt61,2,t5_2s4v2

7806528,0,t1_d3synls,Online  They may have embedded ware that requires or benefits from wireless? I guess you can just leave those on themselves or it could be ruled its all or nothing if its embedded in a cyberlimb.  I would rule that a machine sprite could run diagnostics on a cyberlimb if it was running wireless.  I think the auto arm would be tough without the sensor package but I can conceive of a limbdrone. Cybereyes can have ocular drones. These drones actually double as your eye. Or even a modular mount for a cyberarm and one of your mounts is actually a small drone hand I think these officially exist in rigger ?or a gun. You can buy a partial cyberlimb with a mount at the wrist and replace hands on it that wouldnt have to connect to biotissue.Control override  BrainOwner still has  marks on a limb even if an enemy hacker gets the max . A hacker can control device to simulate a complex action say firing a weapon if they get  marks but what they can probably do would be limited by lack of sensory data. If they were in the same room as them or had a visual footage I bet they could aim and shoot a weapon like any other control device action using their ARVR display like a joystick.  However because the person with the arm is the  mark owner they can just turn off the arm or reboot it once they know its been comprised aka their arm starts to move on its own. Depending on initative the hacker may be able to get a shot off. Its probably all too much work and impractical for any game but I wouldnt disallow it. Cyberlimbs are devices that have their own range of motion. The game abstracts movement and body functions a little. Its why shooting a one handed weapon from a cyberarm uses that one arms stats even though every movement we make depends on other body parts. ,Shadowrun,d3til1f,1,t5_2s4v2

Unfortunately Im not familiar with the Jesse Custer reference but I imagine the whole shtick is somewhat similar to Shepherd Book with a bit more action hero in him.Its a bit minmaxed for my taste but thats personal and I cant fault you for that.  I play with a bunch of noobs so Ive geared myself toward characters that sacrifice mechanical ability for fluff.For example I do love mixing magic and ware but youve only sprung for cyber with the strictest mechanical benefit.  I wonder can you squeeze any flavorful bits into that . essence?I would put more points into SSS.  SeeShootSneak are usually skills I have at   spec for every character.  The importance of this hinges on the question how often can your character perform their specialized role vs these core skills?  Some tables youll find it easy to ignore a deficient there but on most I think youll find that the GM will try to force you into uncomfortable positions where SSS can save you.Disguise and Impersonation can be critical despite your distinctive style.  Simply put a lot of people just wont listen to you if you dont look like youre the right person disguiseimpersonation or belong there etiquette which you have.Overall I think youre gonna need a higher skill priority or youre going to suffer in same areas.  Its not critical enough that its unplayable or even main face roleable as long as the group is aware of the limitations of the character great at talking bad at becoming other people.  Especially since you mentioned hes good at HtH and mechanics of which he has neither.  Good contacts but I might switch the Gov. Agent for a AAA Corp buddy around the same level.

8320738,0,t3_4thfhx,Melee is entirely pointless to compare to ranged on things like damage or versatility. Instead simply be aware of the depth of investment required and the problems you may have.The problems for melee are these. Mobility. You have to move from enemy to enemy. This exposes you more than your ally who is in cover. Additionally it uses your movement meaning you can be caught out when you need to Run For Your Life.. Damage. You need a dedicated melee build to approach the damage numbers that a casual investment into automatics will give.. Threat. By being a melee character you are presenting yourself as a larger psychological threat and GMs should do well to have you targeted more.. Area denial. Being reliant on accessing certain areas of the battlefield area denial really cramps your style. Even gas grenades or ultra glide will completely negate you.. Range. When the opponents are at more than room range you will be left out of the fight since you wont make it to the enemy before it all comes to a close.. Versatility. You can hit  chop  karate people. Thats cool but its got nothing on SnS vs Capsule vs Suppression vs full auto vs called shots.Thats not to say that you shouldnt do it and have a melee character.

8432700,0,t3_4v5e68,Assensing doesnt simply show you magic. It shows you the soul of all things around you. Even objects have some spiritual substance to them even if they mostly appear as grey technology blobs. Shadowrun has what I call the three worlds. The material the astral and the matrix. The flow of data has become so pervasive so intricate and has had so much of humanitys collective heart and soul poured into the matrix that it has become a world unto itself as real as any other. True AI comes into being not simply as a deliberate act of programming but as an emergent property of this world forged by the collective mind and soul of all of metahumanity. These AI are sapient beings with a will a desire a soul all their own. They are life. And at the five hit level Id let a Mage see an AI.The resonance is magic but not as the sixth world knows it. Magic is of life of will of soul of God. Magic is deeply tied with religion and practicing magic is in a way drawing on the power that created us a power that is fueled by mortal faith in whatever that creator may be and that creators faith in us. When a Mage pierces the veil and sees the resonance the reason it is so difficult is because it is magic backwards. What the Mage experiences is not a mortal looking upon the power of God. It is God looking at the power of creation.Metahumanity has created life in its own insane image and the resonance is the prayers of our protean children trying to reach out to us. ,Shadowrun,d5vmm2z,8,t5_2s4v2
8464978,0,t3_4vkrzo,Yikes.  Sounds like hes compensating for poor tactics with strong enemies.  Essentially making them bullet sponges.When I run a game I generally tone it down as soon as a player goes down.  Ill stop shooting to kill and start shooting to harass annoy or create a firing retreat.I do like to amp up the drama though so while a character is providing medical aid I use the Care Under Fire rules from Bullets amp Bandages Ill throw lead their way to keep them on their toes.My players love to use stim patches and trauma patches.  Especially with wireless on.  So sometimes Ill throw a loop by having an enemy hacker destroy the patch.  But in either event once a player goes down the story of getting that person back on their feet becomes more important than the combat scene.Your GM sounds like hes got a great sense of that sort of thing.  Id advise that heshe considers utilizing more advanced tactics ware and numbers rather than making a single enemy into a boss.As for how to tell your GM that will vary from one GM to the next.  GMs basically break down into two groups those that have lost players and those that have not lost players yet.  Im going to guess that your GM falls into the first group.  Heshe will not want to lose another player if it can be helped.  As such Im sure that heshe will listen to your concerns.There are basically two ways to approach the GM with this information.  You can do it by yourself as an aside from the table or you can do it with the rest of the table involved in the discussion.  Its up to you on which is appropriate  you know your players and GM better than we do.  But in most cases Ive found that doing an aside is better.Also do not at all appear confrontational.  If your GM is emotionally invested in the game heshe probably is then it might come off as saying that the GM is a bad person or something.  You want to make sure that youre coming across as supportive and encouraging.  Say you want more of a mental challenge and less of a dice challenge.  Tell himher that you want to fight enemies that attack using some of the tactics from Run amp Gun not some sort of Juggernaut unless youre fighting a Juggernaut then all bets are off.  Im sure that if you approach the GM with compassion and understanding the GM will give you compassion and understanding right back.  In the end Im sure youll all be fine.  ,Shadowrun,d5znqv5,2,t5_2s4v2

8529099,0,t1_d670dg6,Ruleswise  no. Fluffwise  maybekind of if the mages tradition imbues spirits with more individual autonomy and self as a reflection of how the spirit is summoned and what the mage expects the spirit to be like that they summonwhich mean the kind of spirit that they actually summon even though mechanically there are only a few types of spirits.Good oldfashioned Hermetics wouldnt care and wouldnt summon one to chat anyway because they see elementals as constructs of mana aligned to one of the four elements. They probably wouldnt experience or convey discomfort the way dragging a person across dimensions would because its like pulling a toaster out of the appliances dimension. For the more Intuitionbased traditions summoning a spirit is more like the State Farm commercial where the agents are in the middle of office banter and then they poof out of being because theyve been summoned by one of their clients. So say a Crow shaman summons a spirit from the Aerie a location where spirits with mostly avian specifically raptor natures congregate on the Plane of Beasts. The spirits buddies other crows exhibiting varying degrees of anthropomorphism just shrug Oh GVUYIK just got summoned again by that goofy human.It depends tremendously on how you roleplay the spirits. If they are the same individual spirits summoned repeatedly with identifiable names and characteristics then this is likely going to result in a scenario more like the second one even where the mage is from a coldly logical tradition like Hermeticism. This has actually been depicted in fiction and Im specifically recalling Kyle Tellers pet elementals in Burning Bright. They have names and have taken on even more amplified characteristics of their spirit type because each summoning subconsciously imbues them with more and more of an identity. For example his usual fire elemental is much more of an aggressive hottempered jerk than a usual fire elemental would be.,Shadowrun,d67p8xq,5,t5_2s4v2

Then the more I thought about it the more I realized that this sort of post doesnt really belong in the shbreddit anyway.In rShadowrun we strive to be open and welcome to all people who love the Sixth World. However there are people in both rShadownet and rRunnerhub and a few minor other play subs who feel the need to bring their personal beef onto the mainstage.This has happened in the past and based on the number of reports that your post had it was happening again.So in order to prevent any such potential for flaming trolling hurt feelings and general nogoodery I removed the post. I dont mind if the play subs want to try and hook on new players that come to rShadowrun looking for games. But you should keep your runs book keeping and general day to day stuff in the the sub that originated it.This is not a personal thing. I liked you run idea and the synopsis was cool.

Which ive seen.Isnt.. all of that... causing a lot of friction?Sorry I just dont really understand why if all those things are there on a regular enough basis that ive seen them happen a lot despite not posting on rshadowrun much is my run summary and AAR not allowed?from BlackKnyghtM via rShadowrun sent  months ago    Uh I was just putting that there because a runwriteup takes a while to write and its probably useful for peoples home games as an idea for a run.I can see that. But this wasnt just a run idea. It was also the AAR for three run that you did. If you want to repost with just the run idea portion of the post please do. Like I said I thought it was an awesome idea and a great implementation.What isnt needed necessarily is the who did what when play by play.    Ive seen other resources posted by bamce katnine paddywagon strikingcrayon and so on that mention shadownet or runnerhub so why is this one not okay specifically?Specifically? You were the first one to post such an AAR into the sub after a huge conflict between the hub and the net spilled over into rShadowrun. The mods have been in discussion for almost a week about how to maintain a neutral stance and how to help ensure that heated tempers dont flair up in a subreddit where all are welcome regardless of where they play.Sadly your post was the first one to come up since a decision was made.Which was yesterday. I was supposed to do a modpost about it but I crashed out on accident while writing it.     Also theres people specifically answering questions about where do I play shadowrun with shadownet or runnerhub and writeups about how one is better than the other. Which ive seen.And thats fine. If someone comes in looking for a game everyone is encouraged to give their pitch to the new player. We actively want new people to be able to get involved in the Sixth World.But I can promise you that if the comments section turns into a problem I would just as quickly delete that post as well.    Isnt.. all of that... causing a lot of friction?As far as the looking for a group posts go... surprisingly not. Everyone keeps things civil for the most part. So it isnt really seen as a problem.But if it did turn ugly it would be removed as well.    Sorry I just dont really understand why if all those things are there on a regular enough basis that ive seen them happen a lot despite not posting on rshadowrun much is my run summary and AAR not allowed?Like I said youre just the first casualty and its on me for not posting last night like I should have. You have my apologies chummer.We want rShadowrun to be open and welcoming to all. And this is one of the ways that we figured could help minimize any potential problems that might arise.Again you have my apologies. I will get a post up about it ASAP. It might be a few hours sadly because I am just now sitting down to GM my weekly Shadowrun game. But if I get a break I promise you that I will use that time to write it up.to BlackKnyghtM via rShadowrun sent  months agoRight. Well ive certainly noticed some people being less than reasonable on both shadownetrunnerhub while im not particularly partisan about any of it  I just like the idea of running games online and shadownet approved me GMing first.If I strip out the shadownet name drop in the opening paragraph would it be possible to keep the AAR in? I think its honestly more useful than the run writeup. How something acts in play and some of the shortcuts I used to keep the plot roughly on track is the part that would be personally useful to me as a GM rather than just the idea.If its a recent thing you guys have decided to do I guess that makes sense. Like I said not intending to advertise shadownet just thought it was some useful writing that could reach a larger audience if I edited it a touch and posted it up. Internet shitstorms should be avoided but if that means interesting or useful things cant be posted thats a shame.to BlackKnyghtM via rShadowrun sent  months agoHey so id like to know how to alter that post so I can still post it up and people can use it in their home games without getting involved the runnerhub shadownet thing.Would it be possible to remove the references to shadownet and use it like that? Remove the names of the people on the run in the AAR? Remove the AAR entirely? Dont really know how to move forward with this. Prefer to keep it as functional as possible.Additionally ive got like  other runs that I like that id like to put up. So this would be useful for that as well.from BlackKnyghtM via rShadowrun sent  months ago    Hey so id like to know how to alter that post so I can still post it up and people can use it in their home games without getting involved the runnerhub shadownet thing.The community discussion is still ongoing. But I am sure we can work out a temporary fix for you until we get the details ironed out.    Would it be possible to remove the references to shadownet and use it like that?Most definitely. This would be a great start and guideline. Instead of an online game describe it as neutrally as possible.    Remove the names of the people on the run in the AAR?Thats another great idea. Do that too.    Remove the AAR entirely?I dont think you need to do that.

INERTIA STRIKE CLARIFICATIONChange the third and fourth sentences of this section to read as followsIf the adept is successful with the attack she adds Magic x . to her Damage Value solely to determine if a knockdown occurs p.  SR. Inertia Strike does not change the actual Damage Value of the attack.Emphasis mine.So the no damage is no issue anymore.However there is one problem Both rules refer to p. Knockdown. Which is the rule that if you take massive damage either more boxes of damage than phyisical or more than  you get knocked down as a bonus. It doesnt mention anything about not doing damage in the first place. In fact it relies on doing damage to even work.There is the Knock Down called shot on p.  that makes knocking someone down easier and doesnt do any damage in the process.I would think Sweep only works with the Called Shot and they just added the wrong page since using it with the former would mean you essentially do two attacks.Inertia Strike would definitely work with the massive damage knockdown from p.. You do  damage you count it as  assuming Magic  compare it to the targets  phys limit gt Target on his ass.But Inertia Strike is considered a called shot which would probably mean you cant do the Inertia Strike called shot and the Knock Down called shot at the same time so you couldnt actually combine the two after all.In my game Id probably allow it to stack but thats GM ruling.,Shadowrun,d6qfgax,1,t5_2s4v2

Then we reduce everybody by . Sammy  adept  mage  same goes again. Then sammy is at  adept at  mage is out of actions and so on. So that the sammy does not act two times before the mage gets his first go.The only group wipes we had so far of either kind of group before anybody could act were because of grenades.

How they intertwine in the world and in some cases conflict cyberware and loss of essence it all seems to mesh in an interesting way.Elves and dwarves didnt just come out of a magic portal into the world and starting building cities retaining their traditions names etc. No they were introduced into the world through humans. Trolls dwarves orks they all retain their human origins and names. And people didnt shrug off these additions with its magic I aint gotta explain shit it was documented it was observed there was a scientific process to it. HMMWV feels like a prime example.I think however it also sets itself apart from games like CP with its view on the shadows SINs general life. CP felt like a parody of something in a lot of ways to me and those who were getting into the kind of jobs that you see in Shadowrun have little between them and the average citizen in the world.

But I always love messing around and trying to make things work mechanically so lets list off the things that are required Like you mentioned drones are a great way to do this.  It requires you to have drones and a way to control them.  With any semiserious drone usage youll want them slaved to an RCC or Decker backup.  Being behind walls causes noise requires long distance control and since youre killing people probably bypassing defenses.  Another solution is a high quality Sensor Array in a helmet.  Depending on your distance and what youre firing through Ultrasound Motion Sensors Thermo Vision and exceptional audio capabilities might be enough. Depending on what youre firing through this may or may not be an issue.  Like mentioned lasers are an excellent but difficult choice.  A more realistic choice would be a Sniper Rifle or preferably Assault Rifle Since youre infiltrating something more mobile.  The Ultimax Rain Forest Carbine is incredible in the hands of a skilled shot because its P .  APDS and youll be punching through plenty of material.Dont forget that unaware targets get no Defense roll but youre going to have a hard time penetrating and landing a hit but all you need is one success.,Shadowrun,d70ewls,1,t5_2s4v2

IT is also a two way street if an enemy mage throws up a barrier the rest of the security team cant shoot at you either. And then for good measure its an LOS spell. So it can be countered by any blinding effects. And since spells can pass through it just fine breaking the sustained effect is easy for a spirit or mage.Even ignoring the talks f breaking it outright the main use I found for the spell is as an alchemical preparation. Throw a wall grenade with a command trigger on the ground when HTR shows up to give everyone time to escape.

Priority D for skills gives you  skill points to raise skills and nothing else.When you have used all your attribute points to raise attributes and skill points to raise skills you can do stuff with karma. In character generation Priority you get  karma  extra from negative qualities. Karma can be used for raising attributes skills or extra money and to buy qualities.To raise an attribute costs  times the new attribute. To raise Charisma from  to  costs  karma from  to  costs  karma. To raise skills costs  x new skill rating. You can also get extra money where one karma equals  nuyen. Say you have choosen E for resources and the  is not enough you can use up to  karma to get up to  more nuyenYou have these  up to  karma in ordinary priority build as in the core rulebook.

Gives you more flexibility but usually ends up worse.To be efficient in character generation use attribute and skill points to get high ratings in your main attributes and skills. Then buy low rating skills and maybe raise really low attributes with karma. ,Shadowrun,d81l4mo,1,t5_2s4v2

Our employer was delighted that the asset was now a freelancer and wanted to very strongly considering joining their corporate family.We set up a fairly simple trap that resulted in the rival runners van becoming stuck in a narrow alley. I was our combat monkey so we tear open the roof and I drop inside. The runners are just babies. Their gear is still creased from being folded and their guns have that new gun gloss. I have no clue who is the asset. I am also playing an uncouth elf merc with poor impulse control. Knowing I have only a few seconds before the noobs remember theyre armed I inform the GM I am firing a burst from my drumfed shotty into the closest one. He asks which side. I choose my right. She gets gibbed badly caught completely off guard.The GM puts his face in his hands. I am suddenly worried I have just reduced the asset to a set of legs and tomato paste. The GM informs us the runners surrender instantly as I have killed their team lead. We quickly leave with the asset and later discover the rival team was primarily made up of middle class kids limelighting as runners with the leader being the only one with delusions of being hardcore.

9202163,0,t3_56dhlk,Using standard dicepools you are averaging four hits on defense without full defense and  on full defense assuming low end numbers. Thats less one hit on a short burst two on a long burst or short FA burst and three on a fullauto  round burst. That means it takes  hits to tag you without full defense adding  to all the numbers if you choose to take a full defense action. Against average opponents  dice to shoot youre getting hit if theyre firing anything above a short burst. Thats less than ideal if your goal is to be tanking bullet shots. Its about enough to protect you from any random idiot firing single shots though. The numbers change based on what you expect to be fighting and in what situation youre in.  is standard for professional level cops security guards and gangers.  is around specialist level which is also fairly plausible. Dice pools of  are likely to be found in HTR and experts the folks you dont want to be around to get shot at. In your case your defenses are above average but not impenetrable especially as it seems like one or two shots would take you out or make you significantly less useful and therefore prone to getting shot more or killed. Full Defense should be considered in terms of your initiative and what youll be doing in a round. It needs to be evaluated on a casebycase basis and in terms of what your character would be doing at that time. Generally speaking you break even if it would help you not get hit by three or more attacks in one turn. That means its usually a smart decision to use it if youre anticipating being fired upon by three or more people in the same turn. Im assuming youve got Increase Reflexes so your init is sitting somewhere around d. Youre averaging  passes every round and cant actually drop below  so losing one is not a huge drawback for you since youre likely still getting at least two actions a round. If youre the main combatant for your group youll have to balance the need to keep the group safe with the need to keep you safe if that lost initiative pass prevents you from firing the shot that takes out the guy stabbing your decker it might have been a poor choice to use Full Defense.

This sounds like the players have planned out every step and then just execute it successfully.  Players like the Ateam love it when a plan comes together. You dont actually want to punish that any more than you want to have a TPK.  If they are truly planning themselves bored then your runs probably have become too straightforward.  Youve got the right idea for a twist.  Here are some other things you can try to keep things from getting stale   Red herring  A piece of false information that lures the players.  A contact mentions that theres juicy paydata in this offline terminal thats up for transfer. In reality it was already moved by the time the players arrive. In over their heads  Of course the hacker is gonna skim the datasteal.  But its too hot plans to assassinate the mayor records of experimenting on children poisoning the aqueduct whatever.

9719151,0,t3_5e8enk,Building off what uValanthos said why would AZT bother sending their own task force against a bunch of nobodies? Even if the runners did something to royally piss them off unless AZT has reason to believe that your runners will continue to be a problem theres no reason to go after them. Then if we assume that AZT will send someone after your group odds are they wouldnt send their own personal forces to deal with the issue especially not a specialized runnerkiller that likely has far more important missions to be on. AZT or any AAA for that matter will always outsource to the cheapest available option when given a choice. And that means AZT will be hiring other runners to geek your team first before they decide to send in anything bigger. Remember AZT is still in a proxy war with Amazonia in Central America which requires a good chunk of their attention and resources. And again unless your team is posing a consistent threat against them or is in possession of something that they desperately want AZT will only spend as much cash as they feel is worth the effort.

You can write a program that does that and that uses a gun cam to find targets. You would need someone in the team to actually designate friends and foes of course else you are shooting random people all day every day.Pair that with some feedback by the gunclothing the character is wearing that tells him how to move to point the gun at a target and you have a sort of working system. A system far worse and far slower and far less accurate then a normal off the shelf turret but a working system.We can go further still If the character gets a move by wire system I would argue that the system could remote control the character. He would have aiming software puppet his body and shoot.None of this is strictly in the rules and none of this is very efficient but it is possible.

10012963,0,t3_5j1h3h,A DDoS isnt a Data Spike I always envisioned the latter as malware packets selfexecuting and overtaxing the CPU with stress tests. A DDoS involves flooding a device with enough message requests to make its connection to the internet unusable either for access to the web or access by others.  DDoS doesnt really work as well as you think it does. Firstly it usually only works against public connections as the security of most private networks disallows those requests. Also its a sustained attack by a very large number of botted machines. Five minutes of flooding isnt going to inconvenience anyone much. A novice hacker wont have the resources to pull a successful one off.    Now lets put this into a sixthworld context. First the matrix isnt locationbased its devicebased so a person switching from one matrixactive device to another bypasses your attack. Also if youre targetting a device in someones PAN this is going to do nothing as it only communicates with their link or deck. If you attack the hub of their PAN this doesnt interfere with the function of their PAN or any devices on it either.    Also the grid is  a completely wireless mesh network meaning devices are constantly shifting their connection point. If they go silent running your DDoS dissolves as your bots no longer know where to send the messages the previous address being nobody here.  Another effect of that is regardless of the effectiveness of your DDoS youre going to be creating a Noise streak a mile wide between you and the target. This is going to piss off not only GOD but every Decker Rigger Technomancer Sprite AI and CFD headcase anywhere near it. Not to mention anyone whose trix service you happen to disrupt during your shenanigans. You really dont wanna make the feed flicker while Turbo Bunny is trying to watch Run Bunnies those types tend to get ornery about their downtime.

10080511,0,t1_dblgsu4,gt Have you ever actually tried shooting at a target thats not only trying its damndest not to be shot but also shooting back? Its not easy.Right. Im not doubting that its reasonable to expect to be hard to shoot something if youre not good with a handgun. However SRs system is one in which someone bad at shooting has an easier time of hitting what theyre aiming at if they use a fully automatic machine pistol than if they use a handgun mainly because dodging bullets is a thing. Considering that learning to handle recoil is very much part of firearm skill use its odd seeing that the system highly incentivizes people with lower firearms skill to use Fully Automatic instead of SemiAutomatic weaponry in order to be effective i.e. a firing mode where controlling recoil is incredibly important is better for an untrained person than a firing mode where controlling recoil is less of an issue.Even fluff text generally hints that pistols are marketed more towards civilians and police than automatics its just that the systems mechanics in this case do not connect with the fluff. Rule  of firearms is to only ever use them if you intend to hit what youre shooting at so your third paragraph is not correct civvies who would never want to kill anyone with a firearm will never be carrying one and instead carry a taser at most. Civvies who are carrying firearms do so because they know there is a such a situation where they would want to kill someone most likely selfdefense and even if they dont want such a situation to ever arise they still have a gun just in case. When that gun ends up being needed the civvie will expect it to perform.Rather than rewrite SRs rules so that civvies would be incentivized to conceal carry SA pistols instead of FA weapons I thought Id just add a pistol that civvies would want to use and worked my way back from there i.e. Civvies want FA because they have a bad dice pool against dodge how do I give them a high dice pool without FA? gt drones with highrating autosofts generally have decent dice pools how about an SA weapon fired with autosofts? gt how on Earth do I justify a pistol that still works like a pistol but is fired as if a drone were firing it? gt the SafeShot.The Safe Target System in the gun is there mainly for flavor purposes since the gun would be used by people who would be afraid of shooting someone they dont want to shoot.

10592056,0,t3_5rmb13,Welcome to the shadows!First off dont think in terms of a campaign.  The campaign will develop as time goes on.  In the beginning it will be a bunch of oneshots that just happen to have the same characters and players.  As time goes on you can start weaving things in and together to turn it into a campaign.  A personal opinion here shadowrun campaigns are really mislabled.  The word campaign gives a feel of going away to or for some grand or epic adventure with heroic deeds and mighty tales as a result.  Shadowrun setting kind of implies these longer session links should be called lives or something similar youre not going away on a quest youre trying to keep food on the table.Secondly theres a lot of different approaches to character building.  This episode of the Arcology Podcast discusses many of the second tier skills characters should consider.  Which brings up an ancilliary point you can build stat blocks or build characters.  Stat blocks are characters that are good or maxed out in combat skilluse skill.  Characters can have a story told by their character sheets.  uBamce has a video on that topic.. I personally think characters should take skills and accept lower points on skills because its better story and play but dont feel you have to do things my way.Third I understand you have experienced players and some players with littleno table top experience.  RPGs dont all ork the same.  Or work the same for that matter. Shadowrun works best as a cooperative storytelling game meaning the players have the responsibility to contribute to the story direction as much as the GM. Perhaps the best way I can describe this is to quote something a Catalyst Demo Team GM told me once GMs are there to run around behind the players with the duct tape to hold the world together.  Players are going to throw curve balls or running chainsaws at your plans from the first moment.  You will have to learn how to catch them and not lose an arm even turning the results around on them at some late inopportune time. Meaning railroad stories where you play the video gme quest straight through are an oddity.  Its all an open world open map game.As for the books well dont think of them as play modules.  They expand the settings and gear available to use.  You can pick and choose from them to add what you want or ignore want nobody wants to use. Shadowrun is different in that all the books build on the previous one with fluff to make a continuity universe but the books are not required from previous editions to get that continuity.  Thats where uNeoAnarkyOptis NeoAnarchyPodcast really shines telling the lore of the setting without requiring you to purchase five editions worth of books. Also head over to rSixthWorld for other lorebased discussions.  And the Shadowrun Wiki and the Dumpshock forums and.... umm most of the sidebar. So dont feel you have to incorporate everything from Data Trials in your game.  Yes I know its a typo.  It just happens to summarize how many feel about the book.  Good info but the layout logic is different from how the players think so its a trial to understand it.  doncha love explaining jokes when others get it already?Anyway Im sure more aid will be dumped on you in a bit.  Just wanted to helpl out with a few tips where I could.,Shadowrun,dd8hlvo,3,t5_2s4v2
10610534,0,t1_dd9y937,You do know that DampD had a very specific cosmology in which alignements are a semidivine tangible cosmic force that has their own planes of existence and are driving force in the physical plane just like wind and water right? There is no genuine free will in the old DampD. Its sorta how the world of Middle Earth is actually a song and all the actions within it are actually mostly predetermined where divine actors like the Elves are unable to properly react to human actions since they are compelled to only follow the script while humans being mortals can adlib cacophonic bits to the song. Another though weaker exemple is how the elder scrolls is a dream.Alignment was only superficially similar to ethics but was actually a fundamental element of the DampD narrative.On the other hand what I meant was that the ADampDs paladin was just the noble Arthurian Knight and his reason for Charisma as an important stat was that he was supposed to be a leader first and his powers were an added gift by the divine caused by his inherent piety. He was a specific fantasy while the modern paladin is closer to a cleric variant. Theres also the element that you needed a  in a stat and you were supposed to define to define your attributes by rolling  dice and rolling for each stat individually without swapping them around basically being even able to play a paladin required an almost divine intervention and that was part of the concept.Same thing with druids They were a specific fantasy that became a very very very generic template.Its not a problem its just different. And well its a good change in the sense that people didnt understand the original versions anyway.TLDR Alignment is a narrative conceit to allow truly evil wizards to exist and be compelled to create both the living dungeons and the monsters within that otherwise dont make a lick of sense.,Shadowrun,ddae932,3,t5_2s4v2

10686664,0,t3_5stt61,After reading the whole thread this person sounds absolutely brand new to Shadowrun but with enough aptitude to understand how rules work and is clever enough to think of fun and interesting plans.Its been mentioned enough that this player seems to be wanting to be more Pink Mohawk  Im Chaotic Neutral! than you want?I didnt notice Edge being brought up as a way to handle this.  Not just as bonus dice but the concept of Edge is to make the players be able to do the nearimpossible.  You can explicitly Burn Edge to succeed in this but thats kind of an extreme situation and not terribly relevant..  First Id talk with the group and see what level of Pink and Black they want.  He seems to want more Pink.  You mentioned this so thats perfect..  Give him the math breakdown on how things like this work and ensure that he reads the important rules for himself.  Put together a cheat sheet for his relevant role Street Sam I suppose? including all the Called Shots movement rules and quick references to dice rolls..  Suggest to him to be an Edgelord and possibly redo his character creation to accommodate this if he wants to.  Rolling  extra dice plus exploding s can do some crazy shit..  Show him some appropriate Qualities and ware that can help.  There are several sources of ambidexterity that can help with this as well as the Called Shot Qualities.  He could end up taking off some significant penalties here..  Consider a new option for Edge.  In one of my groups we had a variation on the Burning Edge Smackdown.  By using Edge you could attempt to perform an action or skill check that was plausible but not impossible.  You get to use your Edge pool but no exploding s and your limit still applies.  The justification was you just dumb lucked your way through it without virtually guaranteeing a success via normal Edge rules.,Shadowrun,ddi8zq1,1,t5_2s4v2

11130735,0,t1_detkhns,Funnily enough now that you get free contact points and knowledge points in karmagen there tends to only be about a  karma difference between most priority characters and karmagen.Alright so Id be reviewing this under karmagen expectations and k karma to boot good to know. Negative nuyen is still illegal though. Post split into multiple parts because of character limits.Before I get into the finer details the concept is a bit problematic. It seems like youre going for a ranged physical combat offface character. Thing is Vulpine shifter adds absolutely nothing to these roles and based on your sheet these roles add nothing to you being a vulpine shifter. You could literally just be an elf with identical stats and attributes but have an extra  karma with which to tailor your character. Simultaneously you could replace your ranged physical combat role with a social infiltration andor investigation one and suddenly your Vulpine nature meshes extremely well with who your character is mechanically. Fluffing is always nice but  karma is a lot to spend on something that is purely fluff. Itd be like if a decker with  ratings in pilot watercraft decided to get a miniyacht for k nuyen. Sure it adds to the characters flavor but there is a point where these things dip into the obscene.Attributes EDG  is yuck because EDG is absolutely vital for salvaging critically bad rolls and having  means you will free to use it more often plus it means you can make use of EDG regeneration while still having some EDG left in case you absolutely need it. WIL  instead of  or  is yuck because WILs main benefit is the extra stun CM and you dont get that on evennumbered WIL. LOG  is unnecessarily high for this character feel free to drop it to  and spend that  karma elsewhere. For a physical combat character youve got very bad soak dodge and initiative PhysAds generally find it easier to rely on dodge and initiative which means REA  is too low for the role. You will need that dodge especially when youre in fox form and have  armor with which to soak stray shots except for harnesses of critter armor that a teammate puts on you.Active Skills Ho boy. Using bows for Archery is a very bad idea when youve already sunk your luxury karma into being a Shifter. Bows require way too much investment for way too little payoff. Additionally if youre in your natural form theres absolutely no way you can make use of bows. If you really want Archery go for crossbows instead. I see youve spent karma on the Influence Acting and possibly Stealth groups. Thing is you should only be buying groups where you will make use of at least three skills in the group otherwise youre better off just buying the individual skill levels instead. For example do you really think youll be using Leadership often enough to get R Influence instead of just  ranks in Con and Etiquette separately? What about Performance andor Impersonation in Acting? Youre also missing a lot of specializations while they may not be too karmaefficient they undoubtedly add flavor to your character and indicate the precise ways in which they use a particular skill e.g. maybe a Forest spec for Tracking a Street spec for Etiquette Dancing spec in either Gymnastics or Performance that sort of thing. It seems very odd for a wild animal to have no levels in Survival especially one who has a Street lifestyle and absolutely needs Survival to well survive. Youre missing ratings in Arcana which means your initiations will get delayed.KnowledgeLanguage Skills Couple good bits but mostly a bit generic and built tall which is usually bad for knowledge skills. Knowledge skills operate off of a variable threshold system where more appropriate skills only need to pass lower thresholds so its often better to have low ratings in skills that are more specific see Smuggling spec Pacific Slave Trade though Id probably call it Human Trafficking because Slave Trade tends to be used for bigger volumes than the ones present in Shadowrun than higher ratings in skills that are more generic see Yakuza. Knowledge skills are also one of the few places where you can show dont tell so leveraging of lots of lowerrating specific knowledge skills that give insight into your characters backstory are encouraged. To get a bit more specific it seems odd that your character would know about Tokyo Gangs but have no area knowledge about NeoTokyo itself shed know about the street gangs there from experience if it wasnt from experience itd be an Academic skill yet she hasnt been in Tokyo long enough to actually know about the area?Contacts I assume youre being given a free fixer contact otherwise you should definitely make sure you have one with  points put into them. Since contacts are one of the few places where you can show dont tell your characters backstory you should probably put more attention into your contacts who they are what their agenda is what the nature of their relationship with your runner is etc.Qualities Problematic is how Id put it. As a preface qualities are the third big place where you can show dont tell your runner. Negative qualities in particular revolve around show dont tell so negative qualities that dont really add to your runners fluff e.g. Astral Beacon are bad even if they are mechanically efficient. Now specifics. The positive qualities or rather the positive quality that I have issue with Athletes Way. Since adept ways can be purchased for  karma after gen i.e. their price doesnt double and because they do not give any  extra fluff that cannot be gotten with other lowercost qualities you should almost never purchase them at gen. Swallow the effective . PP loss and focus instead on qualities like Natural Athlete if you really are an athletic adept andor Agile Defender if you want to be a dodgebased physical combat character with a much higher AGI than WIL and of course there are a bunch of other positives that would work quite well. As for your negatives Never Ignore Insults is not a Code of Honor it is Poor Self Control Compulsive or Poor Self Control Vindictive Codes of Honor are usually much more involved check out the examples in the core rulebook and Run Faster. Astral Beacon is a bad negative quality because it does nothing to fluff your character you should be looking at qualities like Prejudiced Favored Creature of Comfort Lack of Focus Poor Self Control Phobia Paranoia et al. qualities that inform how your character interacts with the world andor how the world interacts with your character. Im also not seeing your Uneducated quality and I see no indication as to why you wouldnt have it dog shifters dont have it because theyve lived their entire lives in human company while the only foxes that could come even close to that would be a Russian domesticated red fox.,Shadowrun,detnqba,3,t5_2s4v2

11302139,0,t1_dfcv217,gt Cyberdecks are too expensive. Compare the cost for a Street Sams cyberware.... and now compare the cost of a steet sams ware to the cost of a deckers ware. The most expensive sam build is biosam and even then R Muscle Toner has costs comparable to R Cerebral Booster while Cerebellum Booster and similar INTboosting ware is more expensive than Muscle Aug... if youre going any other sam build you are going to be spending less money per attribute on ware and if you need your attributes at a certain level then so does the decker need theirs. The only big difference is that street sams initiativegiving ware is usually incredibly expensive except if youre a drugsam in which case Nephritic Screen  Narco  AutoInjectors are going to be cheap as chips... and technically even deckers need that if they want to operate properly in AR.EDIT Oh yeah and all the important decker ware is Cultured or a genemod so you cant even take Used Cerebral Boosters or Cerebellum Boosters like you can with Muscle TonerAugReplacement.gt However deckers often roll less BruteHack actions than infiltrators or faces roll their skills when deep in a facility.Nope its not just BF and HotF that catch you out its any Attack or Sleaze action. That means Snoop Spoof Hide yes you can get marked just for using Hide and failing since its a Sleaze action and Control Device for devices that dont require a test. Oh yeah and you also still need to evade Patrol IC scans while youre at it something deckers tend to forget about because they are most likely going to fail faster than the Patrol IC scans them thats how bad their chances are. The BampE analogy with Sneaking works for the decker having to evade Patrol IC everything else on top of it is just BS for the decker to have to deal with. The cherry on top is that hacking rolls rely on mental attributes which are much more difficult to increase than the physical attributes that a BampE would rely on. Neither deckers nor BampE are comparable to social infiltration with Con as social situations usually allow for salvaging of failures via followup rolls just like they allow for successes that arent  whereas if you fail on BampE or decking you failed theres no way you can really salvage the situation.gt Rebooting as a first defense is overrated.Im not talking first defense Im talking you know you are being hacked and you cannot turn off wireless for your personacommlink what do you do? Answer because you do not have access to Sleaze or Attack the only thing you can do is curl up virtually and withstand the attack... or just constantly reboot so that you can still use actions like Send Message while the opposing hacker gets frustrated by the fact that their marking attempts are constantly being instareset by your reboots. The entire interaction is just boring as all hell especially if the attacker is authorised to use restricted actions i.e. they do not gain OS.gt  longcon hacks are impossible. Thats not a longcon hack thats a solo run. Longcon hacks would be like I slip a virus onto the targets commlink that lets me monitor their every action wait a few weeks or months for the target to let slip something important then follow up. Its how most realworld hacks proceed via slow and steady infiltration. Longcon hacks have less to do with long setups and more to do with long execution times.gt Seriously youve set off an old school Active Alert and its easy to shrug off?If you have buddies with you like I said you would in that situation absolutely. A host can only run one instance of IC at a time so if you have  buddies with you you all can just play whackamole with IC hit convergence asynchronously so that each persona has time to Erase Mark before the next guy gets converged if you even care about Erase Marks since if youre bopping IC efficiently the hosts marks on you arent worth jack anyway and then its completely smooth sailing from there. SRes IC mechanics make it a waste of time for one hacker to fight but allow groups of hackers to easily ignore IC by playing whackamole.,Shadowrun,dfd2x0m,2,t5_2s4v2

11335778,0,t3_61se5p,Music. Music can help an absolute drek tonne. But youll notice in films everytime something bad is about to happen there wont actually be any music at all. When youre listening to the film the music sets somewhat of a backtone and can be faded out with some action and other loud moments. But it wont every completely go. When the music goes we immediately notice the absence of the sound and that combined often with the lack of any real noise on the board can work to set a scary moment. With the right group.As for an actual design think of it in twofold ways youve got the actual architects themselves. They will want to design something that sets a certain aura and if theyre working on something especially horrific theyll design a building to deter people from actually venturing too far within the depths. You could do that with lots of blast doors and security systems and give the impression that its essentially impregnable. The other perspective is of that to give the monster a chance of actually escaping and not only that a chance of being actually terrifying. Youll do this by having lots of ventilation passagescrawlspaces closed oppressed rooms hidden sections. If youve ever tried to pull back your shower curtain after watching a horror movie youll know just how much your mind screams at you that the thing with many tentacles is hiding there it almost never is. But its that fear that you as a GM can encourage. Its a very primitive one. One of the scariest things that can happen and its often done in such a bs way is splitting up and as a result isolation. When youre trapped inside the building. Sure a runner can function well by themselves but when theyre isolated theyre not nearly as effective. And when they know shit is going down that can really send the players insane. You also need to set up the precedence for just how scary this monster is. So maybe while the runners are midway through they hear a message across the intercom about the monster breaking through that with screams cuts to static or you find mutilated corpses of soldiers in heavy milspec armour mages burnt in brutal flames security spiders with their brains melted. Present the monster as basically unstoppable.  Imagine this as a pitch the runners are told to infiltrate the building for an artifact very milk run style. They plan. They execute the plan. They are caught by guards in heavy milspec and the like and are thrown into individual cells. They hear rumours of the monster down blow. Then lock down happens. The monster escapes. They hear screams and roars outside their cells. The doors ping open. Outside are the same guards wearing heavy milspec brutally torn to shreds. The runners are pinged with a message from the Johnson before to leave you have to kill the monster I hope this helps Chummer in anyway at all but just remember Im not a pro ,Shadowrun,dfgw2ln,5,t5_2s4v2

11526009,0,t3_64iu2x,A SIN is a file and it will usually live on your commlink. You broadcast a SIN to the Matrix to establish your identity. You can think about it as a set of credentials you use to log in to the Matrix if you like.When you switch from your real SIN to a fake SIN you should do so discretely. Anyone watching you in the matrix will see your real SIN disappear and your fake SIN replace it. If an observant bystander has matched the icon of your real and fake SINs to your characters realworld location this might be quite difficult depending on how noisy the area is theyll suspect something is up  just as if they had watched you remove the license plate from your car and replace it with a new one.As for tracking Im not aware that any National SIN users must remain online at all times. You could imagine that might perhaps be a requirement for Criminal SINners. Your SIN being online or offline might be an avenue of investigation for law enforcement but you should be aware that cuts both ways e.g. you might leave your real SIN broadcasting on a second commlink at home while you get up to no good.,Shadowrun,dg2h3wd,4,t5_2s4v2

11630204,0,t1_dge9wr8,Gotcha.  Did you mean to say Doberman instead of Dalmation?  Either way I recommend this kind of loadout for direct combat Fly Spies.  Surveillance and Swarm piggybacking is important and these guys are a cheap versatile option to handle both of those jobs.  Always have a handful of them around or at least something like them Noizquitos are typically banned at tables. Rotodrones.  Theyre good skirmishers and each upgraded and equipped one will cost you about  Nuyen.  Have them harass enemies and hide behind walls or massive distance between sweeps.  They have a lot of speed More defense dice and can get almost anywhere. Paladins.  These can protect your group with Good Cover and even provide a small amount of firepower if modded.  Theyre almost impossible for anything short of an HTR team to bring down because of  Armor. Steel Lynx.  These badasses will wreck shit and at a modded  cost they better.  Upgrade the armor give them Gecko Grips and a bunch of ammo.  Use the Vehicle mod rules not Drone mod rules for these ones.I dont recommend Dobermans as the Steel Lynx is simply a bigger better one and the Rotodrone is basically the same thing but faster and flying for the same cost.  The only real advantage the Doberman has is its weapon mount is legal but not as many slots available for modding it.Heres a post I made a while back its a Drone catalogue with suggestions mod ideas and gameplay uses for a number of useful drones.  ,Shadowrun,dgeao7x,3,t5_2s4v2

11652621,0,t3_66a6pu,I would love it if more Riggers exist even a Dwarfian stereotype but I would not recommend it for a noob. The rules are complicated and all over the place and theyre not the most beginner friendly. Hell I barely get them myself.An elf caster is a good place to start. If you want to go for Magic. I or many other of the excellent redditers on the subreddit can give you a walkthrough of how to make a good elfin mage if you want it. But as a basic overview of what you need at least from my perspective I will give you now. One of the important things to consider is your tradition. Now as an elf you can have obscenely high Charisma meaning your drain stat the stat you use to resist casting spells and the like should be based on Charisma  Willpower. Traditions decide which drain stat you pick so pick a tradition which suits this combo though you dont necessarily need to be a Charisma  Willpower if you dont want. You could be a Shaman nature loving Black Magic evil but not really and many many more. Look at Street Grimoire  Shadow Spells there might be more in other places that I cant remember for more details on traditions.SpellsNow the important thing to remember is you are a mage. Some builds can get away with having low spells but if you wanna have the maximum utility before focusing on a specific class or two here are my recommendations.Heal. If you dont pick this youre an asshole.Levitate. Its the only way to fly.Improved Invisibility. Cause its so helpful its obscene.Trid Phantasm. All the illusions that you mind can conjure oh shit did that guy just summon a dragon? Physical Barrier. Utility and function. Pop a shield in front of your buddies or use it as a ramp incredibly helpful.For Gear follow Bamces suggestions. Hes a goodun and a basic gear guide will help you substantially.If you want any more ideas were here as a sub to help but just remember with any of my recommendations Im not a pro still and likely will have got many things wrong.

11658396,0,t1_dgh3rnq,gtAn exosuit only takes nuyenWhile this is technically true it takes Nuyen to a degree unimaginably expensive. All  limbs at once plus the frame the interface to control it so you had to invest in a full suite of rigger gear. THen theres the notoriety factor an exosuit cannot feasibly be concealed anywhere except maybe a construction site. So youre getting a free round of distinctive appearance qualities to even use it. Then theres storage maintenance and the high likelihood that anything standing out that much means HTR showing up as soon as you go loud....Like theyre a lot of fun in Pink Mohawk settings probably but anything that takes the keeping a low profile part of the game seriously just makes exosuits a huge target.,Shadowrun,dghhsbe,2,t5_2s4v2

Generally speaking I am probably more interested in cognitive than in physical enhancements but it would be pretty cool to be able to  customize your body like a video game character.

11669020,0,t1_dgh19ke,HiFirst thanks for such a well written and articulated response. After reading yours I do now see that the tone of my initial response was a little blunt and could be taken the wrong way. My thought process wasnt to call people out on not getting what they want but more on the surprise that no one was actually talking about the announcement and what I personally perceive to be hypocrisy in what some people were saying about the book. You pointed out good points in your post I agree with I mentioned it in passing in my initial post but I do fully sympathise with people who think technos have been horribly mishandled this edition and the fact something for Technomancers hasnt come out  does show a disconnect and lack of understanding from Catalyst. However I do see this information being trickled down from the Technomancer Team such as the fading values Errata and have hope that the books is in the pipeline. This seems to be something some people dont seem to share here which is understandable but I dont think should detract from excitement for the new book we are getting now. I think thats the key point I so poorly made in my initial post. I love Magic in Shadowrun its the reason I play Shadowrun and not one of the other games I mentioned. I feel yourself and I interpret the lore differently because I feel Magic is a flat third of what makes Shadowrun Shadowrun. I came into this thread hoping people to be discussing the post in ways such as What are Mastery Qualities? What new traditions are we getting? Is this more Goddess or actually good Mentor Spirits? etc. But instead I saw the section of the community disappointed in this announcement and in areas seemingly ridiculing it. I was disheartened and the arguments people where making seemed unfair one sided and sometimes incorrect about the state of Shadowrun th. So I tried to push back with my Initial post in hindsight I made my points poorly and should have explained them more but I still standby them. Your post has explained that there are some deeper seated issues that people have that I havent ticked onto and foolishly glossed over. I still stand excited for Forbidden Arcana and cant wait to see what the writers have done with it. I hope that when its released there is some excitement and honest discussion about the book instead of using it to vent issues about other areas of Shadowrun which while warranted that can exclude people like me who love the magic side and want to revel in it from the conversation.Thanks again for the informative response its shined a light on a lot of things I didnt fully understand.  It just seems that this thread and maybe therShadowrun community just isnt the place for me to discuss Shadowrun right now especially Forbidden Arcana.  ,Shadowrun,dgip6dg,4,t5_2s4v2

Is there more than one credible threat against the players at a given time? Are they AWARE of all credible threats against them at a given time? Can the noncredible threats provide support in the form of area denial Shakeup Called Shots grenades or anything else which will restrict the players?As far as scenarios go not all objectives will be in the same area not all characters will be able to smoothly get to a given area and sometimes things will force the party to split up somewhat. Say that for example you need to simultaneously shut down the power grid to the building at a precise time while also infiltrating it from two seperate points.
