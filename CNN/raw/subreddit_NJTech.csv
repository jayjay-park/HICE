At the very least you shouldnt use AirVPNs proprietary client due to concerns about lack of eyes by the general public on the source code so you should be using something like stunnel. Or ya know OpenSSH. But wait you say? Dont I need a shell not just a VPN service for that? How right you are!The reason its not necessary is that you can just use any of the various free shells on the internet.

If its a technical elective it doesnt have to be that same course it can be another technical elective. The professors dont give a shit if you graduate or not.

11103586,0,t1_deqk6s4,I know but the only thing I could remember is that the width of one field is  bits. I ended up subtracting  bytes when it should have probably been . Pretty weird though considering it could be greater than . For the wire shark lab I just looked at the length field within the packet. It ended up being  but the total length shown on the preview screen was  meaning the IP  TCP header was . I dont know man that exam seemed easy and fair but it wasnt really based off of the homework we did. There was no real math problems which was the bulk of what I studied from homework I did. I would have just read the book if I knew she didnt care about any formulaic algorithms.  ,NJTech,deqkymf,2,t5_2s9ey
11103688,0,t1_deqkymf,not really what wireshark shows you included the Ethernet. headers so some of the  bytes could be that. Also if u were using Ethernet  sounds like the packet was fragmented since iirc Ethernet mtu is  and  bytes sounds like the . length.Anyway yeah IP and TCP can have  bytes of header so your teacher isnt right either if she didnt provide you this info. Thing is  bytes each is even more wrong lol.EDIT yeah . Ethernet header is  bytes Some dont have the  byte CRC at the end so it ends up being up to ,NJTech,deqldm0,1,t5_2s9ey

11469682,0,t1_dfv32sv,. Let me explain the SAFRB process a bit. The reason why we have the SAFRB fund is because there was leftover money from previous year budgets that was designated to be spent on onetime purchases to benefit the entire campus. We start off by getting feedback from the student body through Public Office Hours. From there the Student Affairs committee takes ideas and does the research about how we would implement it on campus. We write proposals that specifically detail how much it would cost to purchase transport and install while justifying the need for it. The proposals go in front of the Senate who approve it. It then goes in front of the SAFRB committee which includes stakeholders from the university like Albert Martinez from Campus Center and Andrew Christ from Real Estate Development and Capital Operations. When they approve it the proposals will be accepted. At each step in the process we ensure that the money will be spent responsibly to benefit students. A lot of proposals that have been approved will be evident in the fall semester after the university purchases and installs them.. I definitely enjoy being a part of Senate. For me it is very gratifying to be able to make an improvement on campus. Even if it is small like a water bottle filling station every time I use it it makes me feel happy  to have made some difference. Unlike some schools there is never a shortage of things to improve at NJIT which keeps me engaged and motivated to do my best work on Senate. Ive also found that Senate has helped me personally. My time management and public speaking skills have improved drastically since joining and it has allowed me to be much more confident and comfortable working with the many groups of students on campus. I hope everyone running for a position has a genuine love of NJIT and feels motivated to leave it a better place than when they started here.  ,NJTech,dfw2zkz,1,t5_2s9ey
