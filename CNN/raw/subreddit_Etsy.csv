5905,0,t3_1u66rj,Hi painter ... Ive had two etsy shops and Im also a buyer.  Probably buy more than I sell.  I think its a great read easy and relatively cheap way to test the waters selling your art online. Ive tried selling my work on my own site before and it was for me much more challenging to get visitors  with Etsy a big plus is that there are already going there looking for art to buy.  Hope this helps!,Etsy,cef3xr0,1,t5_2qq24
97423,0,t3_1v7eka,Cool idea!  Im pretty new at this too but I have done some research.  My advice is to use  to  word phrases instead on  word tags.  cat painting or cat art.  Consider selling prints.  Complete your About page.  People like to know whos painting cats with coffee.  They want to know why and how.  Consider your policies re exchangerefund.  You say everything will be handled on an individual basis but it is beneficial to have policies in writing to fall back on.  You have it set up to only ship to US.  I did this too when I first started.  Consider researching shipping rates and including international orders.  Your items arent too heavy I imagine it would probably be worth it.  Your banner is really lovely but it doesnt speak to your sillyfun brand that you have going with your cats at the moment.  If you plan to add a bunch of serious stuff dont worry about that.  But if silly quirky stuff like coffee kitties are going to be your thing you might want to consider incorporating that vibe into your banner.  It looks really nice so far!  Good luck with it.   ,Etsy,cepis2f,3,t5_2qq24

206305,0,t1_cf1x4nl,For lack of a better word  I believe I used the medium level. Not the most expensive and not the cheapest. I do not buy any other type of advertising. I have some great friends that repost from my facebook page. And if you are on pinterest repins can spread like wild fire.I just got an Etsy order last night from a woman that said she saw something of mine and has spent almost a year trying to find me again. I wish I would have asked her how she found me. I will later.One other thing I mentioned to someone here not long ago was to watermark your pictures with at least your email address. That way if your picture comes up on a google image search a customer will be able to find you.edit One more thing I forgot to add.... Get a twitter account if you dont already have one. Add your suppliers and generally they will add you back. Post your items to twitter. That way your items will be seen by many people that share a common interest.,Etsy,cf1xwua,1,t5_2qq24

394650,0,t3_1y8zbq,The photos are really good. Here are just some tips to make them great.  As a photographer who specializes in selfportraits I have learned through trial and many errors....The photos do not clearly convey the product at first glance. This can be fixed by the second close up photo of the item but a way to correct this with regard to the model is to eliminate confusion and have the model wearing the same thing with the different scarves. Either that or have the model wearing simple clothing in neutral colors black grey or white. Dont have things competing for attention with the scarf.The scarves hide the models neck. While thats the point you could add an additional shot of the scarf worn by the model where it is partly open. It allows the viewer to see the models thin neck and prevents the viewer from thinking its too bulky.The model is beautiful but straight on shots should be avoided. They are static and symmetrical and therefore a bit boring.  A rds angle would define the models face as well as emphasize the profile of the scarf. Asymmetrical shots are more energetic and interesting to the eye since they appear less flat.  Side angles make models appear thinner and taller. Never shoot a woman with her hips parallel to the camera. Also have the model place her weight on the back foot. Other poses can be used to emphasize aspects of the scarf.  For example have the model touch the scarf. Our eyes are naturally drawn to hands.  Also emphasize playfulnessfun by having the model doing more body gesturing  laughing leaning waving. Have a shot where the model is looking off into the distance. Avoid direct eye contact if possible since the eyes are the windows to the soul and we want people thinking about the scarf not whether the model is in a good mood except as described earlier regarding how excited she is to be wearing the scarf. Finally the shots feel a bit cramped. This is due to the tight cropping and the black vignetting.  It is better to crop above the waist or halfway down the thigh. Right under the hip area feels awkward.  A little background or negative space around the model will give the viewer a space to rest the eye. Finally the black vignetting may be more appropriate if the photo background was darker. As is the vignetting makes the photo more cramped and is unnecessary. It also is a bit oldfashioned. Something you want to avoid when selling modern clothing. The photo needs to match the vibe of the product.Good luck and hope that helps.,Etsy,cflo6hm,3,t5_2qq24
480668,0,t3_1zmbxz,There are a lot of Chinese factories that set up shop on Etsy so you could be seeing a cheaply made Chinese version of something they could have even stolen the original images to sell the item from another Etsy seller. There are a few articles out there that talk about this kind of seller on Etsy and how they shouldnt be allowed but with Etsys recent rule changes you can have multiple people working to make one product. So you could get what you buy you just may not get the best thing out there. ,Etsy,cfuwlbn,4,t5_2qq24

1195978,0,t3_27t4ef,etsy provides lots of seller helpful tips. theres some really good articles on successful sellers that could help you. mostly.. its marketing google ad words and crap like that. honestly I havent fully understood it myself.. I would not recommend doing etsy in site marketing  i found it to be ineffective. maybe i was doing something wrong? i dont know..try to improve your pictures  do an insite search for similar products and see how theyre presenting their pieces. ive found customers tend to be attracted to clean lines natural light and quality photographs. I noticed some of yours arent quite crisp  try shooting indoors against some light neutral fabric in natural light out of direct sun. next to a window works great This will improve your cameras ability to focus and improve color balance. Hold it steady or use a tripod to decrease camera shake. your concept is cute. try some variations. think about creating a product that makes you unique. develop a personal style create a niche market. this is super hard i know.. but fun! think about who you are marketing to whats your target demographic? teens? moms? retro pinup types? this will help you in using tagsearch words too. give it a go and good luck! ,Etsy,ci45zgl,3,t5_2qq24

Etsy would just be the listing fee and their percentage and I think they were both about . This is assuming that you dont pay the  to both parties Im not totally sure.I just looked and PayPal is . of each sale and as the transaction total goes up the  is less which seems the opposite of what you want to do to a small business owner.

2204202,0,t3_2kchii,If you have two shops you are required to let customers know.You must use separate accounts to run the shops. Its a pain but there is no other way to do it. I have six and it keeps me busy. You must have separate emails also.You will do better having two shops rather than putting confusing items in one shop. Etsy changes the way people are allowed to search so often that no matter how you arrange your shop having two such different products will probably drive you bonkers if they are in the same shop.I sell vintage supplies and my own designs.I have such a diverse range of items that I felt more comfortable splitting them up into six shops with ten categories in each shop rather than one shop with a bunch of categories that wouldnt interest a lot of visitors. People get bored wading through things they are not interested in.As you said the market for bath products and knives is pretty different. However you might want to think about branding yourself for instance my shops are username plus a word such as ephemera supplies etc. I have the same logo for each shop simple just the letters RB on a plain background. This keeps copycats from trying to use variations of my name because they will never show up any closer to sixth in shop name search. There is a lot to Etsy. Moving things from one shop to another is a pain in the patootie. Thats why I still have seasonal things in my Flagship shop although I started a Holidays shop because it was just too much work to move them and it gets expensive.Good luck send me a PM when you set up and I will favorite your shop.

2617108,0,t3_2pulvy,Its good that people are finding your store. Your SEO needs a little work and I recommend having a simple picture in your listing with all of the available chains clearly labeled so customers arent confused and you dont have to deal with a return if it wasnt what they were expecting. Your jewelry is really unique which is great for the jewelry category but I think you should add more items. I know I know. Youve only been open  days. But as a buyer I love seeing tons of variety and if I see something in search that I dont want but like the style of Ill check out the shop to see if theres something that suits me.That advice should help get even more views. To make the sale you need an about page shop announcement filled out and POLICIES!! I will immediately leave a shop that doesnt have policies but can forgive no about page or shop announcement. I just dont want to deal with the headache and honestly I feel like the shop cant be that professional to deal with if they dont lay them out. It takes about  minutes max. Look at really successful shops and see how theyve done theirs. I dont sell jewelry but youre welcome to take inspiration from mine.As to how long it takes? Its different for everyone. Some take days some weeks some months. If you give your potential customers the confidence to buy from you it could only be a few days in your case. or a couple weeks since most people are burnt out from Christmas shopping,Etsy,cn070if,5,t5_2qq24

2726919,0,t1_cndvffv,I think you can create a FAQ in your About Section. That would be very informative showing that you know a lot about leather. I thought Veg Tanning might be some way of trying to vegan or vegetarian which though you other phrases didnt seem likely. When I buy things esp fairly expensive I like to be educated about it. Makes me seem like an expert too. I understand what you mean when you say Im not a photographer. You might want to look at expensive store watch bands to see how they display their bands. Its been a long time since Ive changed out leather watch bands so Im not really sure what I need to see when purchasing one. Inspecter Jones has a point when saying why to buy your watch band. Do you have enough knowledge about wearing them to say how much of a beating theyll take? They seem very rugged. If you have one youve been wearing forever you might want to have that in the photo with you. I think one of your biggest selling points should be durability and quality. Also being active on the Etsy Forums helps. You learn more about what buyers are looking for like full disclosure on animalssmoking and you may get a sale that way.

Their experience with your product starts at the photo and the description. Make the most of it. Use sensory language what does it feel smell and look like. Let your passion shine through. You need to love the product for them to love the product. Make it unique. Look at similar goods and try to make your post stand out. Are you funny? Be funny. And its okay if it sucks at work.

3216270,0,t3_2wv7fd,Coming from someone who got the advice of the more listings you have the better off you are I dont entirely agree with this. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt depending on what you sell who your market is and who your competitors are. I have a lot of listings for the amount of time Ive had my etsy store but only a couple sales and not a whole lot of admirers. I think it really just comes down to what youre selling and how many other listings youre competing with. If you search your item on etsy and ten thousand pages come up unless you make hundreds of listings youre not going to come up that often. Even if you are priced more affordably and have better quality products than your competitors it wont matter because the customers cant find you. However if your item is useful unique looks great and theres a market for what you sell I dont think anyones going to care that you only have one listing. However with that said if you are going to have only a few listings you should increase your trustworthiness or reputability to your customers by telling them about your shop filling out your bio so you come across as a genuine person rather than a stranger on the other side of the world who may or may not take their money and run. ,Etsy,covd9qp,1,t5_2qq24

3317372,0,t3_2y51fi,My two cents Im not going to repeat what has been said. I do think you should spend some time on your keywords. From what I see they for the most part are all one word keywords. You should think of yourself as the consumer what would you type in the search to get to your product? Leather bracelet? Custom Leather Bracelet? Woven Leather... etc.  That should help you get more views overall. Once you update them see which are being the most commonly searched and update your listings accordingly. ,Etsy,cp6epyo,1,t5_2qq24

Just look at their response after you explained your reasoning. People like this honestly think they are doing you a favor by offering to review something for free and feel entitled to your product. They cant possibly imagine why you wouldnt want to give them something for free in return for all the publicity they think they are giving you.

3976604,0,t3_36062n,OK this is a big long advice lolI was like this last year about this time weddings...this year I have taken a big drop in sales but the last  years I have hovered at about  open orders at a time for like  months at a time.What I do is I schedule orders based on the date they need them. This allows me to book my production and I can manage my schedule much better I started doing this the first year I was open and its been aces. I have a big wall calendar and I write the clients name on their delivery date. I check this every morning to see how my week looks. I print every invoice out and this is how I track everything. I have a clipboard for design out for approval and make and I move the invoice from one to the other as that project moves along. I make notes directly on the invoice and highlight anything unusual like needing to order a special color or if it is an international order etc.Not sure if you are operating the same way or if you are doing first comefirst served? If you are operating on first comefirst served then my advice is to shut it down for  days....vacation mode or deactivate listings. This stops the convos mostly so you can concentrate on the tasks as hand without losing too much in sales.Get yourself together look at every order and plan your attack as far as if you need supplies for it etc. Look at your shipping supplies and get them a little more organized. Place orders or go shopping to get yourself stocked back up.Then group your orders based on urgency and make piles and take the most urgent pile and tackle that first then move on along...When you feel like you have a handle on it open back up ,Etsy,cr9keq7,3,t5_2qq24

4481858,0,t1_csvl8kb,Im glad its helpful!For those listings you see  they are all illegal  they are taking the risk of their shop being shut down or worse. Ive heard of some people being sued directly from Disney and them taking everything from them. Its really just a bad spot to be in. So its better to avoid it altogether and have a safe and responsible shop. I completely understand the watermark thing. I think the solution to that is mock ups.

Etsy is such a great tool and has such a huge market already that if you wanted to debut an original design it would be a great place to do it. As for lending your talents to existing shops I would find some on Etsy that you want to work with and reach out to them directly. Give them these photos to show them what you got and see if theyre willing to work with you. Our reddit community is fairly small compared to how many sellers are on Etsy so Im not sure if you will find who you are looking for here.

I would also say that you probably need more items Im not sure what the average is for paper products such as yours but Id look at the competition and set goals in that way.Definitely though the pictures need to be done ASAP.

I agree with metarinka comment.If youre small you can get a design patent for a couple grand and do it yourself. It might be enough to prevent sales of direct knockoffs with American distributors.

6391457,0,t3_435m51,This would work better for previous buyers as Rogue pointed out. Showing your items to a previous purchaser if theyve purchased from you before.If a buyer bought your cat necklaces and searched for cat bracelets  weeksETC later you showing up for that result where you normally wouldnt maybe youre on page  and the buyer hasnt went that far yet would end up helping you out by pushing you to the front of the line. Thats if you also have cat bracelets.Say you dont have a cat bracelet but have a kitten bracelet and that user already purchased your cat necklace you might return for that if they factor in keyword relations.The same would work for if they did another cat necklace search. Maybe your listing dropped from the top pages now might reappear again for that user but why would they purchase the same item again when theyre already well aware of that listing since theyve bought it unless you offer multiple variations of that search term and the new listings appear over the ones previously bought.Maybe previous buyers might not see items theyve purchased before. Using the example above why show a result that someone already bought when other variations might be more suitable to that user?I dont know how well this would do for previous search results. I dont see it happening efficiently.If that same person searched for cat pillow I dont see why a cat bracelet result would appear if they searched for bracelets previously w no history in their results for anything cat related. Its only specific to one variation of the keyword and isnt a very targeted result. It muddies the results. Someone searching for dog pillows then doing a broad bracelet search might end up getting a few dog bracelets returning in the results if their previous searches were dog related though.Hopefully their algorithm is smarter than their business practices.,Etsy,czg558h,2,t5_2qq24

6443573,0,t3_43w4sq,My first recommendation is always to choose something from pop culture and create something inspired by that to draw customers. The hot air balloon necklace is very cute but not many people are searching for hot air balloon jewelry. Most of my nonpop culture sales are because someone came in looking for a pop culture item and saw something else they wanted too.    I also recommend continuing to improve your product photos. Theyre not bad by any means but the more professionallooking you can get them the better they showcase your pieces. If youre not using a tripod do so. Even if you dont have great lighting a lot can be done by increasing the aperture while using a tripod. Keep your ISO low increase your aperture and adjust your white balance. I always have trouble with the white balance so I use Quick Color Fixes by tavfan to correct the colors in Photoshop.,Etsy,czlszwm,-2,t5_2qq24

When you place your lighter on the magnetized cradle it attaches over the bowl and oxygen cannot reach the glowing embers. The burning pipe is immediately extinguished.

On all of my sequin listings my production time says  weeks and I say explicitly that one of those weeks is to allow for fabric to be ordered.

Accounting is not something you should scrimp on. Its a write off for your business so Id consider  a deal for peace of mind.

8479757,0,t1_d61g7ic,Poking around your etsy and instagram. Ill post a quick critique shortly   Okay! I think your SEO is pretty good but in case you havent seen it yet... marmalead.com is a great resource for tag research. Your pictures are pretty good because they were taken in natural sun however the composition of them makes your product a little unclear. I think your necklaces would look great if they were displayed hanging from a nail on a distressed wood background. Maybe a little foliage can peek into the edges of the photo but you want your product to be front and center with minimal background noise. Because your products are really earthy and spiritual I think it would be too sterile to put them on a solid white background. As for your crystals you have this great photo on your instagram of a handful of calcite crystals. I think this is a great way to photograph your crystals! It gives them scale and just looks really appealing compared to crystals just sitting on a surface.  Instagram is my homeboy. Find people who sell or promote a similar aesthetic as you and follow their active followers. Comment and like their photos. Engage them! You are more likely to get loyal followers if you engage with their content. I think you have the hashtag thing down already . I also do my etsy shop part time only evenings and weekends...and lunch breaks...lol. It is sometimes hard to make time to promote your items so I often find myself posting to instagram while Im working on orders or during lunch or on my commute to and from work.  Other things I noticed I know you are just starting out.. but lack of inventory! I would try to carry at least  different types of crystals. Offer them for sale individually and make custom listings for the necklaces so the same crystals can do double duty. Is there any reason why your necklaces are priced the way they are? I dont think your prices are bad I just think the . cents is kinda weird. I like to keep all the numbers pretty even. Also makes them seem more high quality for whatever reason. Like when you go to a fancy restaurant and a dish is listed as  and nothing else.  I think your item descriptions are really good but I did notice some typos. Im happy to proofread for you if you copy and past into an editable google doc. That is the easiest way Ive found to work with people online and keep all the revisions well organized.  Have you ever thought of doing an adjustable size necklace? So someone could wear it long or shorter like a normal necklace? Also I feel like tumbled stones work better in necklaces unless the rough ones arent too super jagged. Just my opinion!  I also do crystal wrapping and what not.. PM me if you want some tips or tricks. I dont know how well I can convey them through text but I can try! Also... crystal sources  Okay so this critique wasnt all that quick. I really love your shop and I want to see you do well!!,Etsy,d61igvp,3,t5_2qq24
8503932,0,t1_d63njbr, A Seriously ask yourself the questions in the OP number of and quality of photos tags titles etc. They are designed to help you improve your views favourites and hopefully sales! You should be using the entire length of your titles with keywords and search terms. For instance I would title this listing something like Avante Garde Mixed Media Collage  Iridescent Pink Glitter Art  Mania Creature Unique Artwork  Handmade Winged Eye Picture B I use a bunch of different social media but consider it more of a long term investment instead of instant results. I just think of how many times Ive found an item from Etsy I like on Pinterest. Also theres no harm in free advertising and it helps establish your brand! Check out what similar shops are pricing comparable items at. This is a good way to see if your pricing is reasonable. You can absolutely have plenty of personality but dont let it get in the way of shoppers finding your item! Just think of what people would search for if they were looking for items like yours. The first words of your title are the most important so choose them wisely. I like your banner however its a little dark and out of focus. Cast a wide net to start and then narrow in on items that sell well. The more listings you have the more avenues there are for people to find your shop.Good luck with everything!,Etsy,d64jncu,2,t5_2qq24

My pipes are handcrafted in America and are different from any other pipe makers pipes.  My pipes all feature the patent pending Ember Out system which is a cradle and magnet designed into the wood along the top of the pipe.  The cradle is the same shape as a Bic lighter and the magnet attaches to the metal part of the lighter.  When used in this way you can use your lighter as a lid and because it is designed to tightly seal it stops the oxygen and puts out the burning bowl.  This also keeps your lighter handy and helps prevent spillage even if the pipe is tipped over. There is NOTHING like a Ember Out Pipe and I am very proud of them.

Especially since part of a trademark is that youre actually commercially active in what youve trademarked? Like I couldnt go trademark a random name for a random product I dont even sell could I? I met a guy once who trademarked the name of his roleplay forums and he was pretty proud of himself for doing so. And then threw a massive tantrum when it was pointed out that his trademark on that name for one specific use didnt actually give him  control over how everyone on the planet used the words in question.

10057920,0,t3_5jsaak,I dont have a trademark myself nor am I a lawyer but my understanding of them is basically that in order to keep it you have to enforce it. There was this interesting thread about trademarks a couple weeks ago. It would seem like you should at least be enforcing it in regards to your main competitor whos doing the most damage to your brand. How aggressively you should be defending your trademark against all the other people using it seems like the kind of thing your lawyer should be advising you on  if theyre not a specialist in trademarks then they should have a colleague who IS who you and they should be consulting with.,Etsy,dbikkuk,7,t5_2qq24
10075593,0,t1_dbktvbc,Thanks for the support and advice.Many of the ideas you put forward is in my current business plan. I have mentioned somewhere in the comments that Etsy although an awesome tool is my main online cash point. This means it is the tool I use to sell items like a cash register and not the essence of my shop or brand. The other things like a customer base and online platform is very nice but if for some reason Etsy stopped existing today I would like to be able to continue with my current strategy of making and selling designer wooden items definitely focused creating something the customer would enjoy  and I love making commissioned items working closely with the customer especially during the design phase. I also try to build a following outside Etsy using Youtube Facebook Instagram etc but will need to find a balance between making stuff and advertising. Currently I have a few commissioned items and also need to make some stock and do not have time to even design anything new let alone create nice content to post online. I have a feeling that this is a indication that I should focus on making at this stage... Note most of the commissioned items are from customers I got offline and I will continue to build on this also larger items are also easier to sell when the person is closer since shipping is quite expensive.I am aware that many of the negative comments from people I know is because they are worried  and I have to admit that what I am doing is not risk free. It is good to hear both sides even if it is not nice to hear that the business is doomed given that they have some reasons for why I might fail. I think I have learned more from those who say I will fail and why. However without the support form the people who think it may work I would have never considered that it may work and never even tried.But it think I will document this process and keep people updated...,Etsy,dbkvdg7,1,t5_2qq24

I have a  day return policy but if Etsy allowed it I would have a return period of  year. The truth is Im always going to accept returns if a customer asks.

Number of items in your shop can also give you a slight boost to visibility.Luck might have a little to do with it but really you get out of etsy what you put into it.  That said obviously there are some niches that perform better than others so I cant say that just  because you work hard you will be successful.

Weve gotten really positive feedback on this product from other people. Not all folks skin can tolerate oil cleansing so we cant please everyone!

Feel free to ignore since I know I am being that person.The bubble that you only get the top half of and the little bits of coconut fridge that are cut off annoy me when it is up in your shop. The fact that Etsy doesnt have a bottom border on the shop banner like it does for the top and that your banner has a white background to match Etsy causes the parts of the banner that cut off to seem slightly off. Since you cannot clearly see the bottom bounds of the banner you expect those pieces to continue and instead they are just cut off for no apparent reason.,Etsy,deawrij,2,t5_2qq24

11327648,0,t3_5x7cy7,Hello all! AspenBlueCo    is my shop. I have been active since January  and Ive had  sales. I dont promote on Etsy as I havent figured it out yet. I was looking for some feedback on my photos. I have a ton of people viewing and liking them but few sales. Do I need better photos? Any and all feedback appreciated ,Etsy,dffyxkp,1,t5_2qq24

11392161,0,t1_dfn6sfc,True. I dont know what Paypal requires. I would imagine its similar since theyve integrated somewhat into Etsy checkout.But both Etsy and Paypal hate chargebacks. If you attempt to get one through your credit card when the issue isnt with the product or the service but rather that you dont like what you agreed to or arent being reasonable about international shipping times they will fight it. Not all chargebacks end in the customers favor. The credit card company doesnt have the money anymore after all. They have to successfully make a case to Etsy or Paypal to get it.   ,Etsy,dfna9ez,1,t5_2qq24
11478293,0,t3_63twuu,Dont respond a review until you look into your options.  Etsy seems inconsistent about removing review but uses your response a locking it in so they dont get involved.  In the future dont get too involved in delivery discussions you cannot control.,Etsy,dfx2746,4,t5_2qq24
11496159,0,t3_6426lh,Thanks everyone! This is slightly still falling under hobby that I sometimes make money from so part of me is like yeah Ill remake it NBD. But I also know it would not feel great to spend this time making something and then have nothing come out of it. So its awesome to get a more business approach to it. Well see if anything comes out of it!,Etsy,dfz37mm,2,t5_2qq24
11557516,0,t1_dg61o7t,This is good news if true. Will update when I hear back! ,Etsy,dg61r9g,2,t5_2qq24
11579564,0,t3_659k4p,Make them both  or  and be done with it.  Its like food companies. Some flavors of chips or hot pockets cost more to make.  They just charge the average.You can do the same OR make separate listings. ,Etsy,dg8jta8,45,t5_2qq24
11610882,0,t3_65n54x,Can you not report the shop for stealing? Theres an option on her shop page to report the shop to Etsy.,Etsy,dgc3qot,2,t5_2qq24
11654485,0,t3_667jw5,I think its just some intern trolls through and picks some stuff that looks good. Itll have to be something with a clean photo that looks appealing at many sizes and they probably filter for shops that look professional in general. They probably look for stuff thats unique or that not many people would have seen before. But I dont think theres much pattern or predictability to it.I had one of my items get featured as the cover photo for Etsys Fall Fashion Trends page last October. My typical background level of orders is around  per month spread across price points up to around item. But in a week period that October I got  orders of that one  item. Luckily nothing went too wrong and I was able to get them all made and shipped out properly but damn I was not prepared.,Etsy,dgh1toy,2,t5_2qq24
