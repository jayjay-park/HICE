5014984,0,t1_cuqhlsc,Yep I aint even mad except for negatively impacting the groups weekly weighin though in a vacuum I dont think weektoweek numbers really mean much anyway. My calories stayed exactly the same but the composition of a couple of meals in the middle of the week resulted in a lot of excess sodium. No big at all.,TeamWitch,cuqhuan,3,t5_39qxp

5127599,0,t3_3l4o4t,Heres what I do for dinner most weeks.  On my Saturday grocery shop Ill pick up a few pounds of whatever vegetables look good for example  carrots  zucchini  or  yellow summer squash and a small to medium head of broccoli or cauliflower.  Ill usually also buy a pack of whatever meat looks decent and is on sale.  Usually a pack of boneless chicken breasts or thighs or lean pork chops.Sunday Ill prep everything.  Wash and chop of all the veggies then toss them all together in a large bowl and place in fridge.  Marinate your meat of choice.  Here are a couple of marinades I switch back and forth between from week to week all measurements approximate as I just eyeball itQuasiTeriyaki Marinade  to  cup low sodium soy sauce  cloves garlic sliced  inches fresh ginger peeled and sliced  tablespoons honey or brown sugar if you prefer  teaspoons sesame oilSpicyGarlicy Marinade  to  cup sriracha  tablespoon garlic amp black bean paste  cloves garlic sliced or a couple tablespoons garlic powder  tablespoons dry minced onion or onion powder or a bit of fresh onion  teaspoons sesame oilCombine ingredients in gallon ziptop freezer bag massage to mix well add meat and massage to evenly coat place in a bowl in case bag leaks and place in fridge.  You could take the meat out of the marinade after  hours but I tend to just leave it in there all week as I use it.  You may want to flip the bag over once a day if you do that though.Each night preheat the oven to F.  In a baking dish throw in a large handful of the veg mixture.  Drizzle with olive oil then sprinkle with garlic and onion powders and a pinch of salt.  Toss to coat.  Add a piece of marinated meat and bake for  minutes.I find the chicken usually takes closer to  minutes the pork closer to .  My grocery store often also has gonga sales on frozen fish such as cod tilapia or swai.  When thats what I have on hand I dont bother with marinating.  I just toss the frozen piece of fish in the baking dish and sprinkle with a pinch of salt.  The fish usually takes around  minutes unless its a REALLY thick portion.Hope thats helpful.,TeamWitch,cv42gf1,2,t5_39qxp
