3768621,0,t1_cqllsgw,For the moment I think if we give that sort of timeline people will lose interest. I think even if that comes as the eventual timeline its better to continuously keep the discussion going.I dont agree with another login. People will always find a way to cheat and I think that makes it more real and less accessible to everyone. We should keep it within reddit.I like Kreddit personally. And definitely not dollars. Not everyone is from Murica in reddit...I do agree that  shares isnt going to work though.,subredditstockmarket,cqlumfx,1,t5_37xrl
