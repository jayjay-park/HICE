5582,0,t3_1u6rcc,Metagame is shaky af right now. I dont even play that much mostly what I know of CoD Ghosts is based off of livestreams but do you remember BO and the FALKap bans being imminent rather than official? Or even better back in BO do you remember trying to scrim against teams when the Famas looked as though it was going to get the axe or the Rapid Fire AKU? Its a similar situation because of how important Nades are. Double nades with Danger Close and some Strong Arm have been dominating the metagame. Just like how some teams were running a Famas setup before Rapid Fire was banned or how teams were switching to the AUG and using the Spectre instead of using  Famas like what had been the norm theres a lot of shifting around. Everyone knows that DCx are going to be banned but players are shaking around on whether or not theyre using them. Some teams will literally have all  players in nadespots on defense in SnD this is from my playing experience while others dont use either. Because of that theres a lot of confusion and theres a lot of hecticness. The metagame is really in shambles.Another piece are Tracker Sights. Basically Target Finders but you can see through smoke. Lots of teams are abusing this in respawn gametypes like how some teams used to use Thermal ACRs on Terminal in MW. Trackers look as though theyll be banned in a while as well though.From what Ive noticed is effective is a LOT more pressure are coming from  SMG teams. Even on Octane there are a ton in Domination. The metagame is now more focused on using stuns to slow rushroutes while you push up and let your subs dominate most of the map. Sov now has the Bulldog overkill with a Remington in Top ControlMap RoomWar Room you control the area then spawnkill from there.Classes are simpler. Incog vs nonIncog. Double Stun or StunNade. MarathonLightweight or Ready UpSteady AimResilience. FlakTac or not. Less smokes and less thermals. Most every AR runs a nade most every SMG runs a double stun. Much like BO you want to have a full array of stunstacticals to force the other team to counter or be slayed. I dont play a ton though due to time and my schooljobs so it might be a bit off. This is mostly from what little playtime I have and watching a lot of streams.,CoDCompetitive,cef2m6r,10,t5_2tvg8

37931,0,t3_1uikdd,If IW are serious about making CoD a respected esport then they should start watching LoL tournaments and see how professional and well run they are  and learn from that. After a LoL game they cut to an analysis desk to highlight good plays etc  which makes it a lot easier to stay watching for long periods of time. Having said that the breaks between LoL games in the same series are STILL shorter than for CoD  and considering that a single LoL game can last x as long as a cod game I see that as a problem.Its also really bad how they dont make major balance changes before these tournaments. Not even in terms of fixing it but just banning the use of something that triggers it. Something like the ghillie suits which could be banned  in LoL there was a bugged champion so no team was allowed to use it for the duration of the tournament. ,CoDCompetitive,ceiqzu4,4,t5_2tvg8

You said in your video that you think things shouldnt have went the way it did and you the team should have made it work. Do you think the reason he was unhappy is because the team house changed from an outlet to practice more to a popularity contest on Youtube and Twitch? And do you think that is what made the team not perform good at all the events since living i the team house except Anaheim and G?Q Hecz said earlier that he would have made things work with Scump if he came and told him that the reason he wants his own nd team is because he doesnt want to team with you. So if Seth had done that would you be with or against you having your own team and Seth has his own team? And why do you think Hecz denied Scump having his own team he gave YOU your own team when you asked in the pastwhich led to him leaving the team after being  years with the team.Q When Parasite wrote that TwitLonger for hecz was that after or before you approached him to join be honest. i just wanna know if that move really does magic? thanks for your time i had alot more questions but im sure people would ask them too.,CoDCompetitive,cekmv04,7,t5_2tvg8

But then I was becoming optimistic. I knew they werent picking up dedo so I had a feeling something big was going down to replace Saints. Then I heard goonjar in an s lobby saying dude is this a troll? And MerK responded with no bro I think this is serious then I was like OMG proofy or scump as their fourth? Then the chances went from minuscule to . My prediction of scump making amends before champs was slowly coming true. Then the tweets from Scumpii confirmed it all.

In fact CoD  had surpassed Halo  as the most popular multiplayer game on Xbox Live in   with a boasting . million players daily only a year after its release. Your final point is simply speculation and is disproved by the sources above.

I use PC s hooked up with the Turtle beach DSS and in my opinion hearing people is about the same as Astros but the quality is superb. The downside is that buying the headset alone was the cost of Astros  Mixampvirtually if not then I also bought the DSS. So I mean if you want to have the hearing capability of Astros with the sound quality of Audiophile headphones use a Mixamp and Sennheiser PCs. If you feel like  isnt worth it and would rather spend  just get some Astros.

Also this sub is sometimes the best place to look for info on upcoming events and news. I would also go to CODpedia for a bit of history on the scene.

508547,0,t3_1zy9fw,I find it interesting that there are  comments in this thread but nobody seems to have really responded to your point that growth happens because we encourage teams from other areas of our world to grow by giving them a chance at a trip to a million dollar tourney. It doesnt matter if they are bad or if they only had to win one match to get there  because thats not the point. The point is future growth potential and I think you hit the nail on the head. The problem is many people here only watch US teams and maybe some top EU teams and of course they would rather have LV in COD Champs than a team theyve never heard of  and is likely quite bad  getting steamrolled. I suppose it matters what you value more  the international growth of COD esports or the entertainment of COD Champs. I could see a good argument from either side. ,CoDCompetitive,cfy2p6z,16,t5_2tvg8

By competing he is sacrificing so much time and effort into uploading YouTube videos collaborating with others streaming other games and making way more money than he is right now. For sure. The guy has mil subs T subbed on Twitch consistent viewers theyre not leaving if he quits competitive thats for certain. He is losing money by playing competitive COD.Now Nadeshots a good player if there was a team of  gods  Nadeshot that team could still win any team with Nadeshot has the potential to win. Hes not a bad player hes not an amazing player hes just there good for him.

859810,0,t3_23xda9,People are hyper critical of this NV team because parasite is on it. In truth this squad is no more bitchy than most other teams. People just have this perception of parasite as a cancerous aspect to any team he is on as such people notice things they would have previously ignored and attribute it to parasite and then start saying things like look what parasite is doing to this team. Personally I think NV is one of the few teams he can have success with hes a very talented player but does admittedly cause problems. However with an organisation as structured as NV he will never be the dominant voice both Rambo and Hastro will be there to keep him in check. I hope for the best from this team and Im not going to make judgements based on online tournaments that are insignificant.  ,CoDCompetitive,ch20k8q,1,t5_2tvg8

879511,0,t3_247749,Im one of the people that believes going to cable would be a horrible idea and moving the eSport backwards in terms of exposure. Currently scheduled cable programming is going the way of the Dodo and getting replaced by ondemand programmingstreaming services such as Netflix Hulu Plus HBO Go etc. You would also have to deal with the channel not being offered on every cable providerin every country which would potentially limit viewership even more. My guess is such a niche market would be forced onto some of the most expensive cable packages if its even offered at all so it would be unattainble for most viewers.One of my favorite things about streaming competitions is you can change what broadcast youre watching whenever you want. If it was all on one master broadcast you would lose that power and just have to watch whatever they deem would bring in the most viewership. ,CoDCompetitive,ch495ez,6,t5_2tvg8

880365,0,t1_ch4af0w,Did you even read my comment? Why does the fact that an event serves as a qualifier for another event in and of itself automatically disqualify the first event from being a real championship? Why isnt MLG Dallas  held to the same standard? Is winning the English Premier League not a real championship because it serves as a qualifier for a more prestigious competition? The winner of the World Championships for a majority of Olympic sports earn qualification to the next Olympic Games are those World Championships not real?This qualifier argument is baseless a silly idea perpetuated by delusions. The only grounds anyone can dispute Regionals status on is the fact that there wasnt any prizemoney. That is the only difference between Regionals and other events that are considered true championships that I can identify if you find any others please dont withhold the information. Whether this one difference disqualifies Regionals from being a championship is up to the individual. As far as I can tell neither side can firmly claim to be in the right.And for the record I can actually recall the winners of the m and m even though that wasnt one of the sports I was referring to.

Looking at other eSports I think its ok to buy some cosmetic stuff like skins and stickers. Even if you never use them again at least theyll still be there since youll still be playing the same game for years to come.

I could see them picking up Dedo though because hes got that confident and arrogant attitude EG seem to like being very confident and hes got a better AR than Karma and a good SMG on this game. Hed be a possible replacement for him if he doesnt play well but really I dont see them dropping anyone.,CoDCompetitive,ci02t58,4,t5_2tvg8

I know its not the target audience but when people watching ESPN see these gamers are competing for these medals the likes of which the pro athletes they are rooting for are also competing for it may draw their attention to the MLG event. Why not show them interviews of our most marketable pros Nadeshot just talking about how the event is and what competitive gaming is rather than showing people random clips they wont understand from a video game. OpTic met Tony Hawk and a few other pro athletes im sure if you even show these guys dropping by in the MLG tent it will get people curious about it. Any publicity on ESPN is good be greatful. How do you get athletes to go to the MLG tent? Maybe just ask if they want to come along for  minutes and watch if they have spare time and know these gamers are actually competing for medals like them im sure theyll be a tiny bit intrigued to see what is going on.,CoDCompetitive,ci26c3h,2,t5_2tvg8

1302619,0,t1_cig4hb1,This game is so dependent on chemistry and composureattitude.  Looking at it from the sense you just did is incredibly primitive.  A more indepth analysis on the move could bring up the fact that they are replacing a more emotionally volatile player with a player that brings a better attitude and communication.  Adding a more rounded player also puts less pressure on Formal to play an Objective role which could have positive implications on his overall performance since his role on the team was basically to replicate what Apathy was doing with Dedo and Saints already on the roster as Slayers.  Despite Saints being a top player individually this move could realistically produce a better overall team for FaZe even though on the surface it just looks like replacing one good player with another good player.,CoDCompetitive,cig5t58,1,t5_2tvg8

1305468,0,t3_2913zm,Thanks for hearing us out and taking the time to post here.Features I would like to see as well as a good portion of the community would be. Hardpoint from Black Ops  return.. A higher time to kill such as Black Ops  but with better hit detection. Not too much health so that your opponent eats bullets and not too little health where you die instantly. Sometimes in Ghosts you die before you can react or go around a corner. . Have colorful balanced  lane maps. Black Ops  is a great example please do not put that grey filteroverlay that they love to put in their games. They did not have it in MW and it was their most colorful game. Maps like Standoff Raid and Slums where SMGs and ARs can coexist and balance each other out. Standoff and Raid were versatile as well because you could play SnD CTF and Hardpoint on them.. Fix broken camera angles I believe this was tied to the engine of previous games but if you guys are able to fix it somehow when making the new engine that would be great.. Good hit detection Ghosts and MW are good examples but they can be improved. . Theater mode and a Cod Caster mode.. A variety of custom game options like the ability to turn battle chatter off pick teams in the lobby and detailed options like in halo such as changing weapon damage or movement speed. . Balanced weapons that allows for Adjustable Stock to be used on Assault Rifles. Pretty much like Black Ops . ARs are better at range while SMGs are better up close dont make one weapon class too dominant. . Make the perk and attachment system like Black Ops . If it effects your gun make it an attachment like in Black Ops  with sleight of hand steady aim quickdraw and adjustable stock. While things had to do with movement and your character were tied into perks like dexterity lightweight extreme conditioning toughness etc. Please include dexterity as a perk as well after making god knows how many perks IW forgot dexterity for some reason.. Make is so that you dont climb objects from far away for some reason you can climb objects from a considerable distance in Ghosts and it is very annoying especially in SnD when you get into a gunfight. Black Ops  and other CoD games have it perfect where you need to be next to something to climb it. . PLEASE include Custom Button Mapping or a button layout that lets you jump with the left bumper like bumper jumper in Halo. This allows for players that dont claw or have a scuf be able to atleast jump and hipfire or jump and preaim a corner. I claw so i dont have this problem but its frustrating that people dont have the option to jump and aim at the same this puts them at a significant disadvantage yet it could be solved simply by putting in a Bumper Jumper layout or custom button mapping. I know CS GO on  utilizes custom button mapping I dont see why CoD cant. . Make scorestreaks viable for competitive like Black Ops .. A league play system that improves on what Black Ops  did. If a player lags out allow that player and only that player to join back into the game. I cannot count how many times Ive had a teammate lag out during the loading screen. If you guys can also include your own tourneys that would be great or a tourney at the end of a league play season.. Micro DLCs that promote esports and a certain percentage of the proceeds goes towards a prize pool. Team camos emblems etc.. PLEASE do not sacrifice framerate for graphics. I would rather have the gameplay feel smooth than have crazy graphics. In Ghost the thermal scope lags on Xbox One while it does not on the  this is just an example. Also please make thermalinfrared how it was before Ghosts it is overpowered in Ghosts because you can flip to normal sight when using thermal. It should be something sacrificed because you used thermal. . Custom Emblems I know these get abused but just have a report option.. Something different or original that could work in competitive. A dark map like Makin in WaW or Hanoi in Black Ops . Or a rainy map like Downpour from MW. Im not saying to copy these maps but making a map that is dark rainy or both that could work in competitive just to make things interesting and different as well as original. . Make the game as consistent as possible.. Option to disable dynamic elements.. Cater to different playing styles so that one meta doesnt take control of the game. Make it so that teams can have setups but these setups can also be broken strategically this is more obvious in Halo  on the map Midship when one team has Pink and Carbine control.. Make nades useful but not overpowered Black Ops  had it perfect imo. . I know I mentioned Black Ops  a lot but make AW have its own identity.. Nerf knifing by either taking out the lunge making it require two hits to the front and only one to the back or instead of knifing when you press B make it so that you have to hold B when you knife so panic knifing can be avoided.

I feel as if it would help teams a decent amount but youd need to find the right people to do the job.  I feel it could help with respawn game types telling players that other players push this buildingarea X of the time.I agree with others statements that CoD is such a fast paced game that the only thing that would help would be tendencies. For example Clayster has a v on offense on Freight against Goonjar.  An analyzer could only really help Clay by telling him Goonjar goes nd story red  of the time in vs on defense on that map.  These stats could help a player increase certain stats by small margins but Im not sure it would be worth it for an organization to pay a person to massive amounts of time and effort into compiling these stats and reports for the players.,CoDCompetitive,ciib8zf,1,t5_2tvg8

I also think there needs to be  leagues one for pros and one for Ams. Top  from Am play bottom  from Pro to see who gets into pro league for the following season. Bottom  from Am should play the top  from a separate online qualifier to determine who stays in Am league as well.,CoDCompetitive,ciikdi6,1,t5_2tvg8

Online a Qualifier open to any all teams for EVERY LEAGUE!  or more spots should and must be left vacant for an online qualification similar to champs.. CoD isnt like Pro Sports your average Rec league player can not keep up with a pro team however this game had shown time and time again surprise success stories have been able to come out of open bracket and been able to complete with pros thus the best of the open bracket or teams unknown should have a shot at every event of competing with the pros.. Prize Pool should not be less than Teampass grand total if you are doing the current  bracket set up. If open pays K in Teampass they should get that much in prize pool and MLG as a whole should be able to generate money from the pro bracket to make a prize pot for pros.

1388087,0,t3_2a07se,I feel like both sides need to make some adjustments to accommodate the other side but because this post and subreddit in general is basically a MLG hate circle jerk I find myself compelled to play devils advocate. Growth of competitive can be attributed to players and not MLG? Didnt MLG run Call of Duty when it was the smallest part of there events or before they streamed on MLG? You think there is another Esports company that would of picked it up if MLG hadnt? Who? COD isnt as big anywhere besides NA and there really isnt anyone who is credible as MLG or have the resources to make it as professional as it is now.The Players are advertising MLG or is MLG advertising the players? The system of streaming doesnt work if both parties dont do there part to help the other. The same is true for Twitch which makes this side of the argument less stimulating. I think its a pretty well known fact although I cant find proof so maybe not? that MLG pays more than Twitch does. MLG has been growing since before Twitch or MLGs player streaming services existed so its not just that. The current situation brings to light what the players think of MLG and its unacceptable. EG wanted to play in MLGs league that they have essentially been putting money and time into creating for the past couple years and becuase they had a prior agreement before entering the league with a different streaming platform they think they should be able to break the rules that every other pro player and team has been able to abide by. Thats bad business. MLG has offered to give the  COD team in the world as much exposure as they want through streaming at MLG.tv but since they team has an agreement with Twitch they have turned down MLGs offer. Team EG and twitch need to find a way to abide by MLGs rules that everyone else abides by or not participate in the league. EG is still able to stream on Twitch while Scrimmaging or any unrelated MLG material. If EG doesnt work out a way to let there players stream using MLGs platform like every other pro team has done it should be clear to EGs fans that EG doesnt care about them. ,CoDCompetitive,ciqa1eu,0,t5_2tvg8

1427374,0,t1_civ19p1,Melee is pretty much what theyve decided is the best game for them to play. When the next game in the smash series came out Brawl they decided that it just wasnt good enough to be played at the same level. So the Melee community went on theres still a community for competitive Brawl its just not as big playing the game. Picture it like this it would be like if Ghosts came out and we said Nah this game is no good and we just went back to BO. Some people would still be playing Ghosts competitively but BO would be the more popular game simply because its just better made as a competitive game. That situation pretty much happened only it took place over a longer time span with Melee coming out in  hence the old system and Brawl coming out in .I highly recommend you watch the series. Pretty much this documentary alone has started another golden age in competitive melee. Its quite well done and smash is something that a ton of people have played its almost a universal experience at this point. It explains the history of competitive melee and its pretty much a crashcourse in getting involved with the community. It really is a great community theres a lot less douchebaggery going on in that scene in contrast to this one. Its a part series each episode about a halfhour long. Take the time watch the series.

1460367,0,t3_2av3rf,Ive actually had the privilege of playing quite a few pros.NadeshotIll start with this one because it is probably the best story. It was HP on Slums and he was on my team. It was v because one of teammates left and he went insane. Me and my friend went negative and he carried so crazy well that we actually won and he dropped  or  kills.TuQuickIt was black ops  league play and I actually seemed to kill him alot. In gun fights he always seemed to be ready to challenge and I am a reserved player so I am assuming he was lagging and being aggressive wasnt working. What surprised me most was how he would jump out and kill people in the middle of sprint quite frequently.Ogre Victix Rambo SK Halo GodThis was a gb we accepted a random game and we hit this team in black ops . Needless to say we got shit on. It was HP Yemen and they beat us  to . Every time we came from anywhere and ar destroyed us. I am head glitches or anything and it being on their host did not help at all. They knew everything we were going to do when it would happen and just executed so well.GoonjarJust a quick game of cvc and I played horribly.  I took a picture and tweeted it. He was crazy with the prefires and spectating him was a treat. Every death was from behind I didnt see him loss a gun fight.Edit TeepeeOh yah and at MLG Providence  my brother played  or  games with teepee he described it as it sucked but he let me kill him once I remember watching the game and teepee knew where hed spawn and my brother rarely plays pubs never mind comp so teepee just dominated him.,CoDCompetitive,cizbz92,1,t5_2tvg8

1480715,0,t1_cj1t746,Oh I see. I knew Damon always capped the home flag but never really knew it would make that much of a difference to his OBJ stats compared to yours. And I understand where youre coming from when it comes to situational plays in Blitz. A few people hold down the spawn trap while the others go for caps. Thats why Damons Blitz caps were probably higher than yours you were probably going for kills while he was putting in the caps. Or you were baiting in SND and letting your team mates get the kills. So I guess you did get the job done but how much were you actually baiting for your teammates? oO I mean your making it seem as if you were doing that the entire time. As if you were literally playing around Karma and Crim. Maybe I just didnt notice you actually doing it but there were several times where you were just sitting in the back while the other guys were putting up the aggression. For example Freight Dom. Or is that map an exception and your main role is to follow around Crim and Karma and be their support? Once again not disrepecting just need clarification. ,CoDCompetitive,cj1vsy1,2,t5_2tvg8

To go into detail about everything I see wrong with it Id end up writing a book.To make it short in Halo  when I hit  in various playlists that felt a bit rewarding and almost accomplishing especially for MLG playlist.  Even at the very worst youre still playing against pretty decent players and therefore the quality of the games were much higher.  League play sometimes it feels like a quality game half of the time it just feels like playing against random GB players and the rest of the time feels like playing pubs with eSports rules.  Divisions are simply too broad to use as an appropriate ranking IMO plus its a system that rewards players who grind LP games  hours a day.  ,CoDCompetitive,cjfgxao,2,t5_2tvg8

Given the highspeed movement and armor for the person carrying the ball its way too difficult to kill them add a respawn delay onto that and it would be even worse. Someone can literally run straight into the goal from mid map because its so difficult to kill them. Its way too hectic without a respawn delay but add a delay and it becomes impossible to stop the other team from scoring once you go a couple of players down due to the armor. When all you have to do to score is pick up the ball and run trying to avoid gunfights its not a competitive gamemode just like blitz wasnt.,CoDCompetitive,cjrz8fi,2,t5_2tvg8

1733122,0,t1_cjw90qd,gt IW is ActivisiongtAhahah. No.Ahahaha YES. Maybe you missed the boat when Activision bought IW and replaced half its staff.Owners Activision BlizzardIW are not some freelancers that run their own schedule and make games that Activision buys.  They are controlled by Activision their time is Activisions money and if Activision bid it it will be so.  They wont spend their time doing something that goes against Activisions planned schedule.  Like a patch.  They will complete any work done if Activison gives a nod like a patch.Your whole argument is based on it being an impossible bug to fix.  Nothing is impossible here its been fixed broken fixed again so saying that it may be impossible to fix is highly unlikely Activision just dont care its as simple as that because they want you to move onto the next game and be tired of all the irritants and imbalances.  If Activsion hear your cries for another patch they will give a yay or a nay to a patch being worked on and put out because Activision pays their wages and runs their work schedule.  IW is Activision.And if there is a YES from the uppers Activison to patch IW will spend some of their time and resources working on that patch.  If NO they wont simple as that.Activision themselves ignore your cries.  They say NO.,CoDCompetitive,cjxmhqg,0,t5_2tvg8

I cant count how many times thats happened to me and I end up still playing v its just now that kid is free scorestreak points for the other team. I think in LoL the game highlights those players in red at the end of the game and you can report them for being afk and that should honestly come in play in this ranked playlist. There should also be bigger punishments given out for repeat offenders and after they clear like  complete matches or something they start over at like a  minute probation period again if they leave another game after they complete the  matches. This shouldnt be that hard to maintain or implement imo and Id really like to see it...but only if the ranking system is good along with the game and whatnot. Also to add I really liked the...offseason or whatever it was called in BO  its like a one or two week period between the seasons in league play where you dont get ranked. I think AW should have that and that could let players try the playlist out and the punishments for leaving could be a lot less serious. If that makes sense?

ON is pretty safe I see people saying they should drop Ricky but Boze likes him and hes their in game voice of reason.

The maturity of some of the players. How long a single game is around. for example loldotacsgoand starcraft have all been out for multiple years but cod gets released with a different dev every year.. the final thing i feel is holding cod back is the fact that many view cod as a kids game. there is nothing that anyone can do about this but  its a problem that makes the cod community not as respected,CoDCompetitive,ck68y6n,1,t5_2tvg8

Skyrim for  had a bigger world. I expect them to add DLC in the future to add more worlds but I wont be buying it unless Im convinced that there is more depth. The missions are basically running to a spot possibly deploying your ghost to scan shit for  minutes and spraying waves of enemies. Maybe at the end youll get to unload on a boss for what seems like forever. Then after all of that the boss doesnt even drop loot. The multiplayer sucks. Its filled with  shot kill weapons pulsescouthand cannons are basically gimmicks supers are pretty much support killstreaks that can get easy multikills servers blow.

Choked the snd destroyed them in the blitz but got hammered in the sov dom. This time they couldnt take the game  which admittedly was hugely unlucky with rise getting some insane timing.They were inconsistent their snd was shaky and in the respawns they either destroyed the opponent or got destroyed themselves.edit I say destroyed and hammered way too much in this post. xD,CoDCompetitive,cl7ndb6,1,t5_2tvg8

Theyre always right even when they have  people commenting telling him that hes being an ass about something.And then after all of that he pops in randomly as far as I know he never posts here comments here or supports rcodcompetitive in any way and tries to selfpromote the FeaR brand as coming back. What did he expect?  people to be ecstatic about it flip shit and be all happy about it? The whole thing is just a big grab for him to gain followers. From that other threadgtWho would you like to see us play with at MLG Columbus?Right like the opinions of people on this subreddit would have anything to do with those decisions. And then what happens? People explain that hes washed fucked up before with FeaR and he gets all offended and goes off on people.First off he just being an ass in general but second off he has no idea how Reddit works. He must have just assumed that everyone was going to agree with him on everything and that anyone who didnt doesnt know what theyre talking about  because thats really how he comes off as  newsflash that aint how Reddit works.

2195744,0,t1_clixe6y,I feel its different with Esports though. Like i have and always will like the same teams in Football Basketball and all those sports. But since teams are so small and you dont really grow up watching that team like with other sports you kinda just go to individual players. I think the main reason for that is because they stream independently unlike other sports where you only see the whole team play or practice so you learn to like those  personalities that you watch all the time.  ,CoDCompetitive,clixlin,3,t5_2tvg8

2353271,0,t3_2may59,Not sure how many will agree with me but I think that the money raised from microtransactions should go to the events other than CoD Champs to try to reduce the massive deficit between the prize pools of the World Championships  Million  vs the largest non CoD Champs tournaments like MLG Anaheim K  I believe.  Having such a large difference makes all the other events feel so insignificant in comparison prize pool wise. CoD Champs being the World Championship deservedly and rightfully should be the largest event but the gap between the other events shouldnt be so drastic.  In a game like CoD which isnt the most consistent and reliable having only  huge pay day event means that the overall best team throughout the games lifespan could just have an off day and loss the chance of winning an event that counts like  times as much as winning all the other events of the year. Such a huge gap can also decrease the drive of the players and make the later stages of the game feel much more dull compared to the intensity in the run up to CoD Champs.I think splitting the fan funding into the other events prize pool would make more sense than to increase the prize pool of a already massive tournament with by far the largest prize pool. Lets say  Million  is raised by fan funding Id like to see  huge MLG events including a National Championship near the end of the games life cycle with a prize pool of K   K total  K x  already used  K used by fan funding out of  Million raised Use the remaining money to make the UMGs have maybe a K prize pool each and bump up the Gfinity prize pools as well. All this should be doable in under  Million  which I personally think is more than achievable. ,CoDCompetitive,cm2kpw7,1,t5_2tvg8

MirX  If ON could get Mir to separate from Adam Sloss then Mir could be a great pickup. His communication is on point his shot is good hes very talented at the game and would bring a lot of depth to the team.

2667810,0,t1_cn6j63v,I think the difficulty comes with the mid tiergt GBsUMG Wagers and possibly scrimsI would separate these into two or maybe even three tiers. Anybody can play a normal GB match and I imagine a staggering amount of people have only played a normal GB match. Thats tier  after Ranked Play. Tier  to me is probably scrims and low betting Wagers with Tier  being playing scrims high betting Wagers and playing in tournaments how I picture AMs spend their time.In a better world I would like to see Tier  and  possible from in the game no rd party involved. Imagine the game automatically recording game results switching which team gets host loading up the right rules and right maps for the best of x etc. It wouldnt be an easy task to implement but itd be revolutionary for console players.

2739511,0,t3_2rfs1n,Hardpoint is mainly about your teams rotations if you can rotate between hardpoints first and setup AROUND the hardpoint to keep players off of your players inside the hardpoint youll be good to go. Dont ever be afraid to give up  seconds of scrap time on the hardpoint in order to rotate youll gain it right back and more if your team slays a set or two kills. Hardpoint is a very fast paced game but dont ever flood into the hardpoint from one side of it. Always pinch from every angle you can.CTF  this to me is one of the most simple games I dont think I ever lost a CTF on Black Ops  now yes this is a new game so some will argue its different with the new movements but when you have the flag get the flag carriers cut offs and ALWAYS anticipate that one more person will be in your base. ALWAYS count the number of players killed when you have the flag being pulled. You kill all four players? Push up and kill them again then pull. None of this just rush mid map pull the flag and get killed by them spawning. Notice where your team are on the map before pulling.SND  I feel the way you will get good at SnD is by watching pros playing it. Theres so much you can do in SnD. It can be such a slow game or really fast. You can play for picks and then get the bomb down with a  advantage in players. Dont be afraid to clear out say B bomb in school on Detroit and rotate through the back of the map to A as well same applies to most maps. When youre in a vX situation dont spread yourself out. Stay together not holding hands but together to trade kills or bait players. Uplink  This is literally all slaying.

2779423,0,t1_cnjow0m,I think what he is trying to say is exactly what Im saying.  Optic was TRYING to qualify for champs via the online league.  They only stopped trying to qualify via the online league because they were already too far behind the rest of the teams and would have never caught up Optics words exactly on stream.  They then tried to qualify via the online qualifier TOURNAMENT and got beat by Soar at the time.  It was then that they had no other choice but to go through open bracket at Dallas to try and secure top which would then qualify them for champs.  They only qualified via the open bracket because they HAD to and not because Scump was underage.  So the question remains if  was for online only then why did Optic continue to try and qualify via online if they knew that they would have been disqualified even if they did make it?  I remember it being  no matter how they qualified for the event and if Im not mistaken I remember Hecz is the one that got AV to lower the age restriction.

OpTic NationProofy leaving in change for Clayster is the only change here IMO OpTic GamingNo Change Rise NationNo Change given the recent trade with Aware Gaming Aware GamingThey need a th possibly need to look at Legal or Fears from Prophecy ProphecyChanges are obviously coming due to the conflict between Parasite and his teammates so whether or not its Parasite going or not is controversial. Regardless Parasite will go to FaZe or the new UNiTE if he leaves or is dropped. FaZeAches will be leaving this team IMO. His attitude will cause his drop and a trade to Denial for Saints is something I can see happening. Denial eSportsAgain Saints may leave this team for FaZe while Aches will join ZooMaa Replays and Attach. Other option includes dropping Replays a popular opinion on this sub eLevate eSportsCurrently LF I see this team possibly taking Merk JKap or Nameless from EnVyUs depending on what happens there. Justus ProSomething is going on with this team and EnableMochila leaving for a teamup with Slacked and Spacely is a possibility despite the obvious drawbacks of not being able to attend champs.

In some respects its actually worse. rleagueoflegends will go through weeks at a time where literally metaphorically  of the top  posts are RIOT PLZ and requests on how to make the game better. This isnt at its face value bad but these suggestions are frequently repeated and unfeasible. There would be multiple threads daily when Azir was buggy. There is constant complaining about packet loss from the East Coast. Players get shit on more than is possible to comprehend in match and postgame threads. People complain about Riot People complain about the pros people complain about the toxic community. Its absolutely brutal.Its looking fairly good now because there is a new patch coming character updates and OGN action. Just wait for a lull. Itll turn to shit real quick.Also their userbase is  larger than ours and is directly tied to the game itself not just the competitive side of things. Were certainly dealing with apples and oranges here.That isnt to say that all of Hitchs comments are not without validity. I agree with almost all of them.

2830233,0,t1_cnps2dp,At least you understand his decison and think reasonably rather than automatically jumping on the hate wagon asking him to be banned from the league etc which is just absurd.Parasite is contracted but its my view that its better to have a player that wants toplay for your team rather than a better player that doesnt want to. I think Acid and Ricky are in the wrong for essentially keeping him hostage. From the skyme messages released we can see that there was trade possibility they just didnt want parasite to get wat he wants out of spite maybe? which they have every right to do but just shouldnt IMO.You also have to remember if it wasnt for the awful timing of CoD champs he would have stuck with the team for S. The only reason he wats a trade is to have a better shot at winning the biggest event of the year.The way I see it he was left with no other choice. Its an awful situation but people are blowing what hes done way out of proportion just because its Parasite and they want to hate on him no matter what he does.,CoDCompetitive,cnpsjjm,1,t5_2tvg8

2835109,0,t1_cnqbegk,How Is proph in the wrong. He signed a contract. Just because a player wants to be traded or demands a trade the owner of said contract can do as it pleases until it gets an offer that it deems fair. Not to mention the known history of haggy sketching on teams or being a child and just throwing a tantrum and refusing to play which he has also done in the past. He is the one pro I would absolutly make sign a contract with his history. I mean jesus he and the others on elevate talked an org into dropping all their players that finished top  in the previous season. What did he do what a week later ummm... sketch. Who honestly can feel bad for this child.,CoDCompetitive,cnqcja0,9,t5_2tvg8
2835935,0,t1_cnqfpm1,Fair enough if he did but hes mistaken too.You didnt follow the simple logic then and you still dont. I stated Censor is a twotime national champion because he won US as in the nation champs. Activision declared it as such.OG won CoD XP not Champs. See the difference? Its not bias its being consistent. You mocked my view weeks ago claiming I was the only person who could have such a view and then created a poll that confirmed reasonable assumption here that almost half the users of this sub agreed with me but its still clearly my bias.gtThe ruleset or level of competition does not define a world championship. Agreed! Activision not you I or the players decide such matters and thats why Censor is a twotime national champ and Nade is not a world champ.And please drop the you started watching in BO chat. It adds nothing to your argument.,CoDCompetitive,cnqfxk0,0,t5_2tvg8

He is the leader. i think you were spot on with clay and mirx to partner with teep and karma. clay has openly said that he spoke to the COL guys and they resolved their issues and put everything behind them. for him Mr X and Aches were the problem and he was chatting on the ESR with Mr X fine and even said he would team with aches.Teep Karma Clay and Mirx is a very good and solid team IMO. would love to see this for champsseason  if they make it,CoDCompetitive,cnxrxis,2,t5_2tvg8

That CoLEG squad was the best no doubt. When OG wins  LAN events in a row then this discussion can start not after winning  event and doing well online.

2944989,0,t3_2tw45l,Argument being Casuals dont want to spend  on map packs and adding dlc maps in rotation will alienate casuls from hardcore was also over exaggerated. Casual players start playing competitive via ranked play. You dont need dlc maps to play ranked play. If we have dlc maps in mlg tournaments or on lan nobody is being forced to buy map packs to play competitice unless youre a pro or a top am. And those guys compete for a lot of money they put lot of money in their competitive equipments. They would be willing to pay few extra bucks for dlc maps.Besides if dlc maps were to be added in competitive a system could be worked out where nobody is forced to buy the maps yet whoever have them can enjoy those maps in competitive setting.Lastly all i wish to see is dlc map along with regular maps played by pros on lan mlg league and big online tournaments.,CoDCompetitive,co2ux7q,5,t5_2tvg8

Off the top of my head I know that ESL Cologne had over k peak viewership in the finals on GoTV includes Twitch and any other stream link that enables the viewer count to show up and DHW had around k when you add all the different viewing methods.  What people dont realize is that CSGO is growing just as fast if not faster than CoD.

Just to be clear. Were not a dating platform. We take the privacy of our users very seriously.

3105901,0,t3_2vnub3,Can we just stop saying its because Optic had a larger following. How would you like if you had an argument with the number one karma holder on reddit and then his downvote brigade followed you around from that point on?The only thing I saw pros tweeting was that they didnt like the negativity. They didnt have anything against Optic itself except maybe its acceptance that they dont care what their fans say. Before you argue that theyve tried putting their fans in place look at the very incident we are discussing.Optic was blacklisted for crying out loud and all I saw was its members and ownership calling other pros babies haters and unprofessional. If your fans are so toxic that people want nothing to do with you then you should tell your so called fans to shut up and stop harming you.If theres proof of them doing this then my whole view will be changed. To the same degree show me proof that Aches was a part of it let alone the leader. Im sorry but Methodz got caught and blamed the most hated player by Optic fans and you all jumped on it like it was a freaking fact.Its disgusting that these things are being thrown around like its written in stone.

3542780,0,t3_30v6jj,Personally where I stand on this barely is that it warrants a new word. What is that word? eSports. It shows clear distinction from classic sports while hi lighting its similarities too. I think that it is fair to say that football and competitive gaming are different enough to be called different things but similar enough to not be totally disconnected from each other. Regardless of the definition of the word sport which like all definitions is fluid the real life connotation of the word implies extreme physical activity where eSport implies extreme mental ability. So basically like with anything new the appropriate terminology must be invented and adapted. But also my real stance is more along the lines of who gives a shit. We need to stop arguing semantics and tiny shit. Ok so we are a sport... now what? What real value or disadvantage does that provide us? Maybe a bit of mainstream acceptance but beyond that its just a name and this debate really needs to end.,CoDCompetitive,cpw3lgf,2,t5_2tvg8

3596304,0,t3_31jpxx,Marketing is a extremely deep hole it would help but it has to be in a perfect way and a great opportunity. To give a little example from my personal experience I work for a company that has an outstanding quality in the product but the company hit the maximum in sales because quality stops being important in sales at a certain moment. The website was good the company was good but it needed that  thing to happen to let it grow further. Well the opportunity to get on TV came and that gave us that little extra recognition as a big company. More people came to us because they heard our name on TV. And now we are looking to open another location. Thanks to that moment on TV we got that little boost that we needed to keep growing.

4144757,0,t3_37s2hq,With the streaming aspect going on at MLG. I think they are holding CoD back. Other Esports dont even know CoD exists CoD is getting isolated. Everyone who loves watching games goes to twitch. So with MLG.tv u get a situation where people never see cod getting high numbers on twitch. Just because every codplayer is on a different platform. To compare it to another game In league u got a player Faker from Skt . He is from Korea but he has been the best player in the world for  years now. He is insanely popular but korean teams have deal with Azubu to stream on their site. He gets like K viewers on average. While on twitch someone who was just spectating his games without facecam or commentary was getting k. This just shows how influential twitch can be when u look at viewcounts.  I watch a lot of different games on twitch just because when I look at the games and something has really high numbers i check out who is streaming. Also a lot of the codpros play CSGO HZ If they streamed on twitch they would be able to get new viewers who like those games through twitch who eventually could get into cod. People watch streams and certain games because of the personalities. If Optic and their players would stop CoD would fall of hard. Ive never played CSGO in my life i dont even own the game. And Ive been watching a couple of streamers just because they are entertaining like summitlove that guy. I even watched some competitive games on ESL ESEA.,CoDCompetitive,crspwie,1,t5_2tvg8

In AW and in most games Sending data from player to host is faster than host to player. The biggest issue with this is that it is in a perfect environment. Online games have fluctuations in ping so this graph isnt always correct. In a lot of games the data is being sent to a dedicated server which is host. The biggest type will be player to player as usually you play on dedicated servers,CoDCompetitive,cs4tk36,2,t5_2tvg8

4305575,0,t3_3ab6c1,PS. Previously on the PS. I got invested into Sony years ago before I even knew what competitive COD was.I stayed with Sony and bought the PS because all of my friends were sticking on this system  even the guys I GB with and play a ton of COD with didnt want to switch. Were all getting older okay early smid s and a lot of people I know got out of COD and into other games  especially exclusives. I actually did own an XB though. I bought it right after Halo MCC came out. I had never owned an Xbox so I wanted to experience Halo. A month of that game just not working and being a complete disaster of a release turned me off. Also trying to play COD on the XB without a Scuf after owning a Scuf for so many years is just about impossible. Crucify me all you want for that but Ive had a Scuf since BO and could never go back to playing COD especially AW without one. If I had never owned one it would be a different story. Anyway I sold my XB after getting sick of the Halo bullshit and overall just not enjoying the XB as much as my PS. I find the overall UI on the XB to be so cluttered messy and even laggy. Party chat seemed to work  of the time. I had to buy a  controller adapter just to use my headset Its  isnt it? wtf I also have a few complaints about the PS but no as many though. Battery life on the controller is pretty shit. The overall feel of the controller is great IMO and feels sturdy compared to the XB controller that felt like it came out of a toy box. PSN definitely goes down more than XBL however its usually sporadic and isnt down very long. The PS free games of the month make the membership  worth it in the end even if I dont play half of them. Harddrive space is an issue. GB is just not enough. Ive been deleting old games for months to make room for new ones  thats not very satisfying. Overall what I want to say basically is I would hope XB users would give the PS a chance. Its actually a great system  this is obviously subjective but overall I believe it is the better system between the two and the sales are kind of proof to that. The UI and features alone are better for gamers. Im not saying the XB is bad I just believe the PS has a bit of an edge  anyone who says the PS is shit has probably never used one before not to mention the exclusives that Sony has released and also the ones they showed at E all look amazing. ,CoDCompetitive,csayp35,1,t5_2tvg8

When they werent around I would happily play FFA until they got on. Now I can pretty much only play FFA which is ok but doesnt get me to come back over and over. In Black ops  it was pretty much the same thing but with an even smaller group of people I didnt know IRL and sometimes my real life friends wanting to play zombies or something. I do however have a new group of friends mostly from this subreddit that play CSGO with me. I can always find a group of  to play matchmaking with. So I go to where my friends are.

Like you get in a gunfight your shot is hot ass you die and then see him using a speakeasy. It wasnt the variant that killed you. Your shot was shit. Again this is not a personal attack just a hypothetical. As far as lag comp goes I see no difference at all with other games. I get melted in  shots sometimes sure.

5230276,0,t1_cvgfj6v,No I definitely appreciate the effort. But you can not hide behind the fact it is a free tournament for fun when you blatantly went against your own rules. If you want the main focus of the tournament to be fun then dont make rules to forfeit  people just make rules to replay the map. Its pretty simple. This is the third tournament I have been in that you have put on and each time my team has referenced the rules and you have not followed them as stated. And in not going into the semantics of using the MMS. But if you look at the game tape he is pretty much out in the open using it to check bomb in SnD. I myself will not be participating in any more tournaments you run because of this. Not that it affects you in any way its just my choice.

5429172,0,t1_cw54wli,I think if you can accept that Aches and Teepee have a pretty decent chance of not teaming together in BO and the fact that Envy might want a more solid slayer than Merk I think they could very well compliment each others playing styles. Merk is a slower but excellent methodical Anchor AR player  Teepee is a much more tactical OBJ player who in an almost systematic fashion makes amazing plays. I think those two together have a similar pace of play are very comfortable in their roles and boast a LOT of veteran experience.  Now add to that the young talent of Royalty who with BOs movement will still be  turning on people. I think Royalty has proven himself both at S playoffs where he was arguably Epsilons best player and at MLG Finals when he was carrying his team Thrust against Optic on mainstage and through the Open Bracket. Ive heard Merk in a stream talking about how talented Royalty is which gives this prediction a chance. Im particularly excited for this team prediction because if Merk acted like a mentor for Royalty and really helped him with his critical decision making the potential for Royalty is unbelievable. LEt me put this into perspective for you the number of individual vs in respawn that Royalty won against Scump in all their matches together on mainstage is actually greater than his number of losses. I have been counting each match. Royalty is faster has better reaction time but is just young and inexperienced. Now give him the leadership and strategy caller of Merk particularly in a game where Merk will understand the game fundamentally and situationally better I think you have the emergence of an incredibly powerful and clutch slayer in Royalty. People should give the guy a chance he is raw shot is literally on another level with how quickly it turns and locks on you its BO Veteran Botlike.  As for my prediction of Neslo I do agree that thats probably the weakest prediction of the entire set. This team needed a th and Neslo was at this point a FA. Neslos become pretty talented with an AR but also is a strong SMG. Hes also a very technical player preferring to do a situation by situation analysis of games which is why I think hed be pretty good as the th. At the top of my head I cant think of a th whod be better in terms of gunskill and talent as well as is a free agent or in a team looking for players other than Dedo and I dont think Merk and Teepee would team with Dedo unless if Dedo came out and offered to do so. The addition of Dedo would send this team potentially into Tier  given how much each of these players are playing within their comfortable roles and the fact that they are all very talented and tested players. However I just dont see Dedo leaving Iso for this squad.            ,CoDCompetitive,cw5mrx3,1,t5_2tvg8

Sure having Activision can grow CoD eSports in the long run but weve never  shouldnt rely on them. Weve had a few rocky moments in our eSport but weve benefited from most things.Call of Duty isnt gonna die anytime soon and we as a community can band together like weve been doing for all these years. Take it from me  Ive been involved in CoD eSports since  and throughout those years weve done nothing but grow.I cant remember if it was Clay or another pro who made a Youtube video on this subject but the general jist of it was no matter how tough things get the community  CoD eSports will never take  steps back.

Its not like BO where shotguns had massive hipfire spread and thus a lot more forgiveness in hipfire aiming. You get a little more forgiving aim in exchange for being punished much more if you fail at map awareness and movement.And I understand that LMGs being better at defense and long range can make them annoying but they are bad at offense and close range meaning to do well with an LMG your team has to first set itself up to win on offense and overcome flank weakness.My point with LMGs is that the communitys reaction namely saying that all LMGs have to be banned or nerfed rather than just the gorgon andor dredge serve as an example to the general attitude of the community when it comes to different weapon classes.,CoDCompetitive,cx7smn9,1,t5_2tvg8

5768817,0,t3_3u5q1y,I thought the whole concept behind BampP was to add a new competitive element to the game to make players have to learn to adapt on the go. If we have to waste bans on uavs doesnt that kinda defeat the purpose? For example instead of needing to ban uavs we could be banning a gun we know a certain player on a certain team is really good with Then were forcing him to adapt on a larger scale then just bringing out a rocket launcher or running ghosts. Imagine if the endless possibility of bans if we dont have to waste them on uavsCuavs Wouldnt it be more interesting to watch people play out of there comfort zone and have to switch things up big time rather then just chucking on a perk. Im  sure if they stay everyone will be banning them. As for your scenario a less skilled team can easily get a uav just by juggling a hill for a few seconds? Is that really fair a few seconds effort for a game changing score streak? Obviously this is just my opinion its not right or wrong however just thought Id throw my  cents in.,CoDCompetitive,cxc6bbz,1,t5_2tvg8

But the aches I have seen throughout AW and the first month of blops is complete toxic to any team. Its the same deal with players like phizz and killa who have never even tried to be able to grasp the new uptempo speed cod revolves around. Guys things do change and no matter if we like them or not we must adapt. I have high hopes for teep and NV but for as long as aches keeps being toxic they will never qualify. Old Egos will soon be dumped by top teams once players like the under  E god squad becomes of age. Good luck to teep with that NV squad.

I agree if someone is threatening someones life or well being it should be addressed as long as it is a result of something GB related.

I feel the spawns for other maps are controllable but not for combine.

5897741,0,t3_3vzwsu,Judging by the majority of responses to this thread people seem utterly unaware that every bad thing theyre predicting as a result of this league already affects the women who play competitively. This league isnt going to cause a massive skill gap between men and women and its not going to make traditional teams pass us over for scrims and make it harder for women to be taken seriously. All of that already happens.Fem League is a plus imo. The aim isnt to segregate women. Its to make women feel welcomed and included in comp CoD. Once we have carved out a space for women we can look at breaking the wall back down and being inclusive. But that equality and inclusion is utterly impossible in the scene the way it is now for a number of reasons. A womans only league is not a solution but it is a step in the right direction. In saying that I think the traditional league should be open to both genders. Lastly  as uQueenSelly said  if someone is offering us this opportunity why not accept it? I was taken by surprise when I saw that some women are totally against having a femalesonly league. This whole debate has been conducted as though the female league is nothing more than a concept. Its not. Assuming it all goes ahead this is a real league with hopefully real money and real prestige on the line. Are you going to turn that down because youre mad that the CoD community isnt the idealised paradise of equality that you want it to be? Hell nah. I would love for CoD to have an even gender ratio amp equal opportunities for all but thats not the way it is right now. We can work towards change but right now we can only play the hand weve been dealt. Im jealous that this is NA only  ANZ has so few serious female competitors that wed struggle to play a v between us. Id fucking kill for an opportunity like that.,CoDCompetitive,cxsq7cn,2,t5_2tvg8

5926066,0,t3_3wbn85,Im from Singapore and honestly its extremely hard to get into competitive CoD on consoles.First of all a console is considered an expensive investment over here and with the XboxPS player base split theres even lesser Singaporean players on each console. I am seeing more of my friends and people I know getting consoles though so this point may not be as valid.Secondly its extremely hard to really enjoy the game competitively when the amount of time we have to wait for Ranked is about  minutes and even then we almost never get  bars since well be playing against someone from around the world. Not sure if this has to do with servers or whatnot but since Im not an expert I wont infer.Lastly the Asian scene is mainly dominated by FP games since like I said above consoles are considered a luxury item so plenty of people choose to play FP games and go to cybercafes instead of play on console. Thats why plenty of organizers over here have been leaning towards PC games such as Hearthstone LoL DotA and some Asian FPS games since there are more players.The only exception I know of is probably FIFA because soccer is probably the most popular sport among our population so theres bound to be more players but its tough to convince organizers of competitive FIFA to delve into other console games.,CoDCompetitive,cxwfshu,1,t5_2tvg8

I see amateur teams giving the pros a run for their money now this is a very good thing.  The amateurs are embracing the changes and being creative with the tools at their disposal.  The pros are trying to rely on just gunskill and their egos.  Lets face it gunskill in a game with this low ttk is a thing of the past anyway.Change the game to a game of strategy and creative use of the map and equipmentspecialists and you might actually come up with something people are interested in watching.Use the equipment that defines the game stop calling everything anticompetitive.

To many players are voting S amp D and to many plays quitting if it is not S amp D.Want to play S amp D? Complete a CTF HP and Uplink game first. The end.

6233064,0,t3_40yih1,gtAn example of this is how there isnt a simple colour distinction between the two teams as youd see in any sport where the teams wear different colours. I get that you can see whos currently on screen by looking at the score board in the top right but if each team had a specific camo on their weapon it could make knowing which team youre looking at a lot easier without having to take your eye off the action.Camo is something that can stand out on a map. Forcing a team to use a specific colour of camo could be to their detriment on a map like say Stronghold. If a player is lying in the snow they could be missed but not if there made to have a bright red camo on their gun. I think this a nonissue. Just glance at the bottom left it says whos being looked at the team theyre on and it has their colour too. Surely you can spot the green or red out of the corner of your eye? Thats all you gotta do .gtAs for the technical terms again Im comparing with conventional sports broadcasts and I feel there isnt that level of prerequisite knowledge needed when watching them. Is this just due to the fact that they have been around for much longer and any terms they do use seem less specialist as we have always been exposed to them?Yes. Yes it is. More conventional and more widely reported and discussed.gtAnd do the casters ever take a moment to explain some of the terms used and the basic rulesmechanics of the game and Ive just always missed it? As Ive already said it must be quite hard to digest for anyone who doesnt know much about Call of Duty or even to someone who regularly plays multiplayer but doesnt know much about competitive as the two are worlds apart.They explain the rules of every game before it. Before almost every single map they explain the rules and how the game mode works. The exceptions are when games start quickly and they dont have time. They explain terms when they can but the game is very fast paced. If a team are rotating from one bomb site to another its not going to be a good cast to explain what that is every time its happening at the expense of commentating whats happening.gtId just like to hear peoples opinions on some of this stuff. Maybe give some more suggestions on how they could make it more appealing to the average viewer and maybe even give me some tips on what to look for when Im next watching.Watch more! Its the key to any eSport or regular sport really. Commentators cant really break it down to the brass tacks for you because the majority of people tuning in know those finer details. The more you watch the more you understand. They might not explain what flanking is the first  times you hear it but you can see whats happening and when its explained that th time itll just confirm what you suspected it is from watching.Watch the pregame discussion between casters too. Thats when they explain more because they have more time. ,CoDCompetitive,cyy4qws,1,t5_2tvg8

Weapons in CoD were HK lasers that took little to no skill to master. Jugg and SP were eventually taken out of CoD for a reason. They were crutch in nature and had no place in the game other than to fuck up perk and weapon balance. I believe if CoD was remastered and implemented what made all of the good stuff that made CoDs after it great and left out all the bullshit than itll be amazing. Other than that CoD in its current state is dated and if it were to be brought back the way it is now than itll ultimately be a huge step backwards for the franchise.,CoDCompetitive,czjhsdk,1,t5_2tvg8

6695221,0,t3_479xxo, Riminjeet Singh  ScotlandUK I like eSports not sure if sport is the correct term as it seems to promote physicality which seems paradoxical despite PokerChess being in the same boat I feel but I dont see how anybody can find anything wrong with people competing in a fair environment to see who the best is. To me its pretty much the same as watching someone play Chess or something  and its something I thoroughly enjoy and find entertaining. Definitely feel the scene is growing  I started off watching in BO and everything has been improved since then production value maturity prizepools etc. Think CoD eSports will continue to grow but hit a plateau in a few years Definitely interested in eSports  mainly CoD viewing and playing GBs etc but also watch CS and LoL very occasionally. First started in BO when I was just going through CoD videos and came across competitive and fell in love. No real favourite organisation I love the competitiveness more than an actual team  at a push Id say I had a soft spot for OG a few years ago for introducing me to the scene but I really like every team unless they give me a reason not to. Touched on it before  its a fastpaced game which in the competitive ruleset allows us to compete to see whos the best a natural human instinct. Glad to see how much the community has improved over the years and how big names are paying attention from Activision getting involved to several big names having links to CoD teams  hope it continues but just feel like it will plateau. Not looking that far head really happy to see how far competitive CoD has come. Not really  just online tournaments. Not many LANs in Scotland and I dont think Im good enough to justify going many hours out my way to one. Would consider going as a viewer if I had someone to go along with. Somewhat  see answer for Q. I dont think it should be stigmatised whatsoever but I personally wouldnt call it a sport despite it being competitive entertaining and fair. Would not like to see it be an alternative  Psychical Education is very important perhaps have it more of a workshop kind of thing where its done afterschool or something but dont feel it should be uprooting existing subjects.

In the real world people lay down bombs underneath the road which makes the opposition use more strategy to get across stuff like that. Also there is something called ban  protect.. which could change the game everytime. Also someone using a trip mine in a corner building with me using engineer will make me think they are using map awareness which could help me locate where they are on the map. Then I could communicate to my team mate who has hard wired to plant the bomb or run that route while I check for places he could be.

At the same time though I think you make a rule that subs can only be made before a new map begins teams must notify the official of any roster changes prior to joining the lobby once a team member joins the lobby the roster for that team is locked.  I think it would definitely add another layer of complexity to the whole scene.  The conversations are no longer about the matchups but the roster swaps mid match who they should have started what comp of players would be best considering what another team has...There are definitely enough players to fill these roles as well.  ,CoDCompetitive,d0sdt2u,10,t5_2tvg8

Loony has always been someone who thinks hes the best pro on the circuit but like Slacked is actually one of the worst also his loony doesnt miss thing needs to go because a lot of pros out there have better shots than him and if you look at players like formal who are literall laserbeams and you dont see them banging on about how they dont miss. Just another way loony proves his immature ignorance. Anyway I do actually like octane and classic theyre talented and good people.

He said he felt as though you should start the game with your specialist but only be able to use it once per map. I agree with him this would make it used more sparingly as each player only as one chance to use it. I think it would make the use of the specialist far more strategic and valuable. Also getting killed while using a specialist weapon would be far more damaging. I think theres some issues with implementing this obviously overclock becomes useless in this context so youd have to find a positive change for that perk and you arent really rewardingpunishing players for doing wellpoor which I can see as a problem.

If Crimsix happens to have his Camo while in a fortunate position he can make an exciting play that changes the game gets the casters screaming and makes the twitch chat explode. He kills two players that cannot see him. Exciting. Woo.However no specialists means the better teams win each engagement and promotes less random gameplay. Personally Id rather see Crimsix pop out and get a clutch two piece with both players shooting at him a real nasty play. But this would happen less often.Weve traded actual excitement and extraordinary plays for manufactured excitement and bullshit plays. But some people find different things exciting and if you like flamethrowers and invisible people who am I to say you are wrong.,CoDCompetitive,d1aicfs,17,t5_2tvg8

7011763,0,t1_d1b3mev,You really just picked EG to make your example? They dominated Ghosts and when they have a bad event it shows they werent consistent with their online play? LOOOL what type of fucking sense does that make? You are picking out exceptions out of every example to fit your narrative. OpTic dominated the entire AW season but since they lost to FaZe it means online is a joke? Loool how about the fact that they won  events and dominated the entire year just like how they did online? Their online play was just as consistent with their LAN play. You dont just dominated on online and shit the bed on LAN or you dont shit the bed online and win an event on LAN. Try to name a team that dominated online but couldnt perform on LAN I will wait for you all fucking day. The entire UMG SC event was flukey. Almost every match was affected by blue tooth scuf problem creating unfair play and flukey matches. Also youre clearly a Aches fan haha claiming Formal has NASA net to make yourself feel better after he shits on your team. There is a reason he has been a top  player since Ghosts and is currently amp with Scump he cant bring his so called NASA net to LAN.

7189081,0,t3_4dxjfk,You wont get noticed from having a good GB record. But if you have a good GB record or on whatever site you want then its an indicator you know what youre doing. The better you are the more likely you are to play pro teams or against pro players in tournaments.If youre good enough thisll happen on multiple occasions. Theyll take notice when you beat them or even if you run them close a couple of times. But you want them to take notice of you in a good way so dont be a dick be respectful dont shoot bodies and teabag unless youre freakishly good and you want to show them that cocky attitude but thatll affect my next point. After getting known youll probably get a chance after a few dozen tries to play with a pro player who knows you if he tweets out hes looking to do a tournament but needs one more player. If he knows youre decent and nobody better responds hell probably rather play with you than not play.Once you start playing with pros do not cause any drama do not get into anything. You want to be on the good side of everyone  Im not saying ride everyones dicks but dont give anyone a reason to not like you. If you prove youre a good teammate calls out accepts criticisms and comes up with new strats or just make big plays can keep things lighthearted theyll play with you again. By this point youll be playing with other nonpro players and youll slowly transition to playing with pro players more and more. From then you should be picked up by a proper team someone the same stature of XGN  lets say who arent great but people have heard of. Then you show up prove to people youre good and then make a better team. And so on til you reach OG.Sounds simple right? Not really. Youll need not only talent but also a lot of luck friends you need to trust in the scene who dont stab you in the back and a great attitude. ,CoDCompetitive,d1vc5go,6,t5_2tvg8

7237210,0,t3_4ejtei,Yes! I Played quite a few years of GBs and my most memorable moment was a day where we played a GB match against Nade Scump BLFire John and GB match against Proofy Fearless Stain and some kid who was relatively known at the time and played with the nV crew quite a bit. Anyways it was MW GBs and our team record was like  or something we had been a top latter variant team for a few years first NA team sponsored by SCUF when they expanded into the United States. Hey Duncan Hey Simon  we had also been scrimming seriously to attend a UMG event that year so we were super hyped when we found out that we were playing a couple members of the actual nV team because we hadnt been having good scrim partners for a while. This was like the second match of the day that we were playing. First map was like Seatown CTF. We lost in OT after a hard fought match. Second map was Underground SnD. We traded rounds with them and then I was placed in a v. I was Defense and I somehow pulled out the clutch. The next round was offense and I got a k which allowed us to easily win the round. Then it came down to the last round. We got defense and we had battled it all the way down to a v. My Buddy Chopsticks was trying to defuse the bomb planted by the known kids name that im blanking on right now. Anyway he was on top platform all the way up by the one spawn. Chopsticks had only a few seconds left to defuse so there was no time for a fake. The nV player choked a full ACR clip and  shots from his magnum from top platform by the stairs and umbrella I think? on Chopsticks who was defusing the bomb behind the actual bomb. It was probably the craziest game that Ive ever played in. And extremely lucky. So the rd map was CTF Dome and we got our shit pushed in when we had dome spawn but we were able to keep the score close. Then with about  minutes left in the second half we found ourselves with the lead. We turtled for  minutes to hold out for the win. There is a VOD from Proofs and Chopsticks stream from this game but Im having a hard time finding it RN. Then late that night we ran into Nade and his crew. My buddy at the time was living in a small apartment with his parents house got fucked by a falling tree so he would usually have to go to bed earlier otherwise he would wake up his parents. But this one night he decided to stay on late. I think it was because we were still buzzing from before and were pushing for  wins or something. Anyway halfway through Bootleg CTF Vod of this match somewhere as well my teammate says to us that his mom is pulling the plug and that he was fucked. Regardless of being down a man we battled for most of the map but eventually lost. Played v the next map SnD on Terminal we got beat but it was also close if my memory serves me right. I then sent a message to Nade saying that if we told him what happened then he would have cancelled the match. But by the time we told him what happened we had already reported that we lost.There are VODS of all of these matches somewhere and I would love to watch the games back especially Underground SnD with nV. If anyone finds anything please LMK! Edit Just realized OP said funny in your post. I guess the choke was pretty funny lol,CoDCompetitive,d20th3y,6,t5_2tvg8

They lost  of the group matches at Pax Prime and then lost  to Unite in the finals.  UMG Atlanta wasnt dominant from coL wasnt it like  to coL versus tK?

The argument to ban the verix sight is the same argument you could have against the grip on the Vector in Ghosts or grip on the BAL in AW. How is the argument even remotely the same? The Varix can literally REPLACE foregrip. You can have an extra choice of attachment because you dont need foregrip whilst running Varix. This is not even close to comparable to limited recoil on a gun when you were actually USING foregrip. The only way to have foregrip in AW was by running foregrip.

Youre just saying its possible and Im just saying its obvious.gt If the players did decide to even the series out they wouldnt tell the casters. The casters work for ESL. That would be a ludicrous idea.Of course.. but I think youd notice that the series you casted the week before which ended  was being replayed and back to . My only point about the casters is maybe they were told to keep quiet otherwise they were just absent minded because casters usually refer to previous games the teams have played even if they werent strange. So thats uncharacteristic.gt During the game the casters mentioned that it was an odd game.They were fine to mention it then yet they didnt mention it on the replay? People usually talk about things like that even if that particular instance hasnt happened in the past.All Im saying is that this is still all kinda weird and unanswered and an explanation from someone like the lovely zed would be cool.E I guess bygt If they did throw the game to even the series theyd never say it.you meangt If they were to have thrown the game to even the series theyd never say it.because then youre not saying it was possible they threw the game away.E I dont wanna keep debating lol CoD is on.,CoDCompetitive,d4i5dtx,1,t5_2tvg8

After all that theys hould get punished with a forfeit and pretty much hand pave the way for a struggling dT to get into the S  playoffs? it doesnt make sense.

If this is the case then it would definitely balance specialist because they wouldnt be some one hit wonderOP ability char in game. Thus ban and protect can actually make sense because say theres a lot of water. You obviously would want to protect or ban the reaper.

I hope both rosters stick together but I could honestly see something like Formal to Optic Halo or Clay to OG. Well see though Im hoping for the best.

9339278,0,t1_d8zlqnj,This is the case entirely. And for uComplexityFanboy and his point. The reason behind jetpacks making low TTK more viable is simple. Yes in pubs you can then zoom around and get a bunch of kills but since this sub is geared towards competitive that mindset needs to be kept. I cant even count how many times even in BO Ive had a guy dead to rights even on bomb defusing and he jetpacks up and away and kills me because I get him really weak but that extra bit of health makes it hard. Now you could say to me simply turn up your sensitivity but that creates inconsistency. Turning up sensitivity no matter how much you practice it enough to keep up with boosts cant be perfected. Its that kind of inconsistency that ruins competitive and if were forced into jetpacks we need to work around it. Lower TTK means two things. That person boosting still has the advantage of deciding where they boost and can still win that gunfight if the play it right.. The player shooting at them has a chance to easily counter them so long as the have adequate reaction time and aim.Now you can say to me what about games like Halo or Overwatch where TTK is high or variable? Well in Halo it makes sense. The game is centered around power weapon control anyways and I think that makes it different. Same for Gears too actually. Overwatch has its own system and in the end it really is a completely different game anyways.I do see potential value in perhaps dropping health regen in comp and having higher TTK cause that would force you to have to value your engagements and might make it better but Im not sure about that and would have to actually try it in practice. I think youd also need some sort of HP counter and then you end up looking like a shitty CS clone so that becomes less viable but I am still interested in it.Any of these ideas do one thing as mentioned before and that is makes the gameplay more consistent. Consistency allows for you to be able to really practice. Like indepth work on strategy. Yeah we have them now but its kinda like go here throw a smoke or whatever and hope for this reaction. Or rush maybe itll work. I think if you could have total consistency and make tactical grenades actually tactical you could make it so that they could even have a place in strategy. Smoke off an open area for a flag run so they have to boost over to get the kill then you have the advantage because you know the likely outcome. Then it can get really meta and you can slide through the smoke instead. It can all evolve organically this way. I think of how my team playing GBs did for this game and see how we always had potential for greatness. Hell wed face a top of the ladder team and play well. But that slight bit of inconsistency that thing you cant practice for caused slip ups now and again. It ended up feeling like most of the losses were by chance and not skill. Dont get me wrong some games we got outright stomped and so that says to me there is some competitive nature even in higher TTK but its that randomness that shows otherwise.I think of our same general team on Ghosts. We lost some games because of dumb stuff but this is Call of Duty and its online so shit happens. But I always felt that every loss was because we either had worse gunskill or because there was that slight something we lacked. A well placed smoke or a lack of coordination for pushes. Ineffective trading capabilities. The game might have been halfbaked in terms of maps but I think it played better as a competitive feel otherwise.I dont know much of how IW map design will be though because we havent seen every map yet. I do think DLC should be free though and the games should last longer than a year. Id say maybe  and each DLC can have a possibility to add a new map. Or maybe have maps as options for comp and do a community pick for what is best and add a map or two for comp to keep it fresh. But that wont happen cause money rules COD in the end.I think ultimately we become to enamoured with the idea of making it what makes it better for us that we forget that often makes it noon friendly and by proxy less skillful and competitive.Things we should be concerned about are things like specialists and now rigs. They become a problem because you just start banning this banning that. In the end it becomes clear the game isnt suited for competitive anymore. In the end it goes to what Gandhi said what makes a good competitive game is a game that ships ready to be competitive. If you have to pull stuff away then it wasnt that great of a game for competitive.Dont get me wrong the game never will be. Activion clearly doesnt care about that in the end and its about sales. Theyre aware just like you that comp sells well but not like noob friendly pew pew laser guns and big explosions. So they will appease us by paying for champs and promoting the scene but this game can never be pure competitive with a dash of DM and casual like other games.So what Id say is swallow your pride and admit that sometimes your shot isnt good and because of low TTK youll lose gunfights. But that is what is actually competitive and fair. I dont want ultra low  shot level stuff just not a whole clip to kill. I also believe that accuracy and damage falloffs needs to be better adjusted according to fire rates so that we arent crossmapping with SMGs. As an SMG player I should only be viable in short to medium ranges. Those AR players should shred me at long range.Sorry for the long essay but I think at this point this deserves more than telling people to quit their whining.TLDR I suggest reading my whole rant because although I ramble a bit its important to understand what about TTK being low is good in terms of the current meta and a bunch of other stuff. I respect if you dont though. Short at sweet low TTK means lower sensitivity and more consistent and accurate shots. Makes the game more competitive as a byproduct.P.S. Again this deserves more than a simple quit your whining. I think I did a mediocre job of actually making a clear picture so if people are interested and I can actually find the time Ill write an actual full essay on this shit and explain my perspective on what COD specifically needs to thrive as a competitive game. I have been tossing around ideas for years and as Ive bounced around and played probably every competitive shooter there is on some semblance of a competitive level Im slowly getting a picture of what the niche might be for COD and have a case semibuilt. Id be interested to see what the feedback on that would be. Though time constraints would hinder it a bit so even if for some unknown reason people were interested it probably wouldnt happen until after IW launches. Though that might not be a bad thing as it would also give me real perspective on how the game plays out and might even change my opinion on TTK a bit. And again sorry for this brick of text I tried breaking it up some because I really had a lot to say.,CoDCompetitive,d8ztl3f,0,t5_2tvg8

Losing in a tournament early shouldnt mean you are playing at a disadvantage even if you manage to make it all the way to the finals. Youre taking away an advantage from one team in the finals but you arent punishing the WB or rewarding the LB team at all. The winners team would have had an easier road to the finals.The team that hasnt lost is being put on equal position from the team that has lost youre essentially saying straight from that that the loss didnt matter that its okay to slip up or that we shouldnt give the advantage to the team that performed more consistently. The WB team should have an advantage because they performed better in the tournament. Or you can look at it as the losing team despite making it hard for themselves after they lost a series i.e. didnt play well enough to win that time being propped up in the finals.gtYou see all the time Team A can lose to Team B and then beat Team C who beat Team B. You also see teams struggle against a team and then beat the team that absolutely destroys that team. For example Envy goes to game  with Elv and then Splyce destroys them but it was obvious that Envy is still the better team than Splyce. Another example is that Optic s Elv but some maps are close while Envy beats them even harder but when they come against Optic it is clear Optic is the better team.Right well this is just hugely simplified to say cod in inconsistent. Teams match up against each other differently they play at different tempos they nullify each other differently you cant definitively say Team A beat Team B and Team B beat team C so therefore Team A would beat Team C. Also no is it clear OpTic are the better team? They didnt play against each other at S Playoffs which nV won they faced in Grand Finals of MLG Orlando a close  for nV then OG  then at XP nV won . Its very hard to say who the better team is when you look at the last  months or so.gtCod is inconsistent losing a series to a different team can mean pretty much nothing especially in a bo.Right. Which is why a league is probably the most fair format to do it in. But in a tournament you cant do that so thats why you have brackets  and the best teams have better seeds and therefore an easier road to finals.gtWhat matters is how teams stack up directly against each otherSee above point youre not doing it through the rest of the tournament.gtAlso a game  r is basically pure luckgtOf course you could argue that the game could go to map  r SnD and although that would still technically be luck its obvious that the teams are evenly matched if they took  maps off each other.If they took  maps off each other it would show theyre pretty evenly matched tbh.gtAlso how can you argue how much more exciting it would be to see an epic  map battle between two teams. It is the best way to decide who is really better no flukes.Well first I dont care about the excitement value I care more about ensuring the fairest format possible. If we have that in place we can make it exciting but I dont want to compromise the fairness of the finals to make it more exciting.Also what if one team starts off the BO slow like goes down  in map count. Then they trade the next few maps showing theyre equal but lose because they started slowly. They lost because they played one part bad and the other part good despite showing theyre evenly matched. You said it yourself teams can play below average at any point if youre that worried about it occurring then you should allow the team coming from WB the same advantage you give the other team. Otherwise in that scenario one team loses has a lifeline the other team plays poorly but shows theyre eve and gets punished.,CoDCompetitive,d94awzs,1,t5_2tvg8

They are totally different things. You can still get a ton of kills pubbing and stuff its just a totally different way. You have to play slow and ease your way to their spawn.

I dont mind IW as imo the beginning of it is exactly the same as BO. No proper competitive playlist some guns are OP as hell people judging the maps for sucking and the whole jetpacks suck argument. Matter of the fact is and some pros need to realise this too is that this is the game for Esport COD this year. It will get better as time goes on. But to make it a better environment for new players we dont need the whole toxic bullshit. Fair enough if you just dont like the game Im not one to tell you what you like or dont like. But its retarded to bash a game and presume all these dumb illogical negativities when its no different to last year. Lets face it its only because MWR is released with it as to why a lot more are hopping on the hate train. Because its easier to go back to a game they have enjoyed in the past than to adapt and try be positive and try something new. ,CoDCompetitive,daita09,6,t5_2tvg8

Our roster participated in ESEAPremier for four seasons and was considered one of the top AMsemipro rosters in NA. They were recently acquired by eUnited and the definitely deserved everything eUnited offered.Our goal entering the COD competitive scene was to secure an AM team that has the potential to perform at a high level while representing us in a professional manner. We thought it would be best to establish ourselves within the scene as a reputable brand rather than signing a high profile roster that might leave us after ATL.Were excited for the future and we hope to be a part of the competitive scene for quite some time!,CoDCompetitive,dbrdmt2,9,t5_2tvg8

10197943,0,t1_dbzz2x6,In honesty I kinda think so too. However the trouble would be getting their attention. I think that if they took this idea had their staff go over make the changes they are paid to come up with run it by a board of directors that it could happen. Maybe not exactly like how it is here though. Heres why  They approved a remaster of Modern Warfare to make some more money.  Releasing BO remastered even as a mainly competitive game would make them more money as well. This is because MW Remastered was needed to help sell more copies of IW instead of helping to boost an investment in the eSports side of things  which is currently going no where and that Activision is likely under a lot of pressure to try and fix. They were willing to remaster something to make more money before they could be willing to do it again. Adding a focus on eSports makes it even better because it is likely to sell a LOT of copies since its cheap the existing casual base will probably buy it along with people who are interested in eSports.  And will continue to sell copies as the eSports scene continues to grow since not only is it cheap but it is fun to watch. As a bonus it doesnt cost nearly as much to remaster just the multiplayer in the beginning.Sure it does close the door of pulling the same kind of tactic they did with bundling MWR but it also opens a lot of avenues in terms of their investment of eSports and the future of gaming. ,CoDCompetitive,dbzzrxz,3,t5_2tvg8

10199166,0,t3_5m14qb,gtOpen the doors to casual players to become more interested in the competitive scene.You identify this yourself as a must but I dont think youve actually addressed this very well the proposed system is going to sound much more favourable to people who are already interested in the competitive scene but where does the attraction lie to casuals? Or will they still continue to buy the annual CoD game that gets marketed to all hell?And thats one of the major things  the newest title will always be the most valued. Creating a standalone title might be great for us but the growth would be terrible I fear. Activision could make more on competitive attaching it to the newest title each year most likely.Lastly and I dont mean this personally because Ive said it to others as wellgtyo fan trying to understand and help you understand Activisions current competitive CoD marketing strategy and suggesting ways that it can be improved upon.What youre suggesting is that teenagers and young adults either do not think much about the plans they have for competitive or that we can do it better the fact is we more than likely dont. The time effort and resources Activision have dwarf ours and what we have in game knowledge doesnt actually mean too much to them since they can easily garner that information if they want.Not saying its a rubbish idea but it just wont happen.,CoDCompetitive,dc04ryd,1,t5_2tvg8

10218063,0,t3_5mb5ho,Worst reason is by acting like youre the best just bc of a score line. Now Im a Slayer so dont get me wrong I love a game where someone is going off with kills but a killwhore can be just as detrimental as a person going double neg that is actually playing the right spots. A killwhore could be playing the wrong side of the map on rotation just bc he wants more kills counteranchoring where as the person going double neg was able to set up his teammates better by getting some key kills on spawns to win them or a couple gunfights to get the last  on a hill regardless of how many kills they get overall. Score lines are a semi false sense of who is better than who and people let it get to their head. ,CoDCompetitive,dc29wvh,20,t5_2tvg8

10246527,0,t3_5mo4ai,All this drama IW brought on themselves.  Damon acknowledges some of his comments were out of order but frustration can get the better of you. I have never known a Cod game to have so many issues affecting casual and pro players. Some of them are mindblowing and just look amateurish and lazy. IW also feed the frustration with their lack of information regarding issues . There will always be people you can never please but a large majority want the game to be a success .Like it or not but the fans are the customers and we are the most important part of this equation. You need to have good relations communication between players and devs. If fans keep leaving there eventually will be no more Cod. If this game had not been coupled with MWR then sales would have been terrible for a Cod game.IW needs to communicate inform and fix all these problems. Whether it is true or not to the community this game seems more about cash grabbing than quality. Karma loves Cod and just wants the game to be of a high standard. You cannot turn the heat on the community for IWs failings.,CoDCompetitive,dc5i15d,1,t5_2tvg8

Its important that both of you give each other daysnights off and to take a break from reality for a little bit. For example I take my kids at least once a week for a day so my wife can have some time to her self. Just as I get my own time. Balancing time is also balancing your partners time.

10618485,0,t1_ddb7e8f,gtBecause I find that to be the highest degree of competitiveness in CoD? Controllers are tolerable but Id respect the skill level required more if I knew that high accuracy and precision wasnt just gifted to you upon starting up the game it was a skill developed over months and years of practising and grinding the Game.CoD would be a laughable eSport imo. Compared to CSGO it would just be a point and click game as I explained earlier. Besides many pros depend on the game to pay the bills. Perhaps it would be a little bit more competitive but why sacrifice the economic lives of so many pro players for a little bit more of competitiveness? gtWell of course not haha itd be their livelihood at stake. But sometimes you gotta either fight or flight I think itd be fascinating to see which Pros try to adapt to a KBM Comp CoD scene and which just hang up the sticks because they cant adapt.This just makes me believe your entire argument is crafted out of pure evil. Whats so funny about peoples livelihoods at stake? Its what they do to put the food on their plates.Thats the most hostile wish for the pros that Ive seen someone say on this board.,CoDCompetitive,ddb7sx9,2,t5_2tvg8
10619683,0,t3_5rza2j,This can work for cod but most games in general I have gripes with these things. People that dont make calls but then complain because we didnt follow up or trade. Especially when they say we should have done x so we could win the game AFTER the game. If you arent going to make the call mid round or match then you shouldnt do it in that  hindsight vision. It always comes off as smug if you talk down to your teammates like that. Someone that says stop doing x when they are performing just as well and you are losing. Its usually always a communication error not a performance error in similarly skilled teams. ,CoDCompetitive,ddbc94y,7,t5_2tvg8

10625307,0,t1_ddbvpn6,I had Slacked in my T and Classic in my T. IMO these two were consistently Rises most important players throughout the year. Octane was a great AR but he started playing less as the game progressed and you could tell how much Rise struggled when he wasnt slaying. Which is essentially why ARs like Clay are more useful because even when theyre not slaying like monsters they just do little things that still have a huge impact on the game. ,CoDCompetitive,ddbx3uj,1,t5_2tvg8

When I got here my internet used to be a kbps satellite connection recently got a different connection still satellite but better ISP which is Mbps with a data cap of GB after that it drops down to around kbps. Internet is a bit expensive here Id say.Although My ping is okay not all that though its like a ms to the capital New Delhi but that doesnt matter because I could have a ms ping reading to some server but that doesnt tell me the ping to hosts in CoD games. Ive never had problems playing custom games with friends but the only problem that really happens is when someone uses the internet in the house. mb really has no cushion for usage. Its either all for your game or you lag until the person stops.The worst part though is when an update drops. Takes hours to finish. I cri. Still havent finished the IW update mb left as im saying this.Tldr. Speed doesnt matter it takes time to update though. Make sure you drop your PSxbox in the DMZ or forward ports. Ive had mine in the DMZ and always have an open NAT helps joining any host as you already know.

Yes they cant go for every timezone but theyll want to cover as much as possible and probably shoot for pmpm Eastern time if Im guessing under the current system which is way better than starting at in midafternoon. Theres no way we get good production if the casters and MLG staff are pulling Gfinity like working but worse because theres  streams so less down time week after week after week. CWL Stage  last year was like  matches  days a week. You want to increase that to  matches  days a week. It would be too much. The only way we make your idea work is by turning it into a  week stage rather than a  week then I see it working. But then thats too often for teams to travel.,CoDCompetitive,dfm3q92,1,t5_2tvg8

But we know Clay can as he has shown it multiple times in the past and thats why I a nobody have put him in my list giving a thorough explanation each time. I dont get what you want me to say Sorry for thinking about this differently from you here Ill put on someone for your favourite team who I dont have that far behind anyways?,CoDCompetitive,dgb6wlv,1,t5_2tvg8

11605136,0,t3_65lnnr,I was one of the best players in WaW. Played with people like Karma and CMPLX but most competitive players stuck with CoD due to the PCL and such. The game just simply wasnt good. Snaking was unbelievably broken. You couldnt see someone and they would almost be teleporting. Head glitches were broken more than any other CoD game. You legitimately could not see someone at all and they could kill you. The MP with stopping power had a  bullet clip and can kill you with one shot to the head. The game modes were okay but War was broken where if you were winning when it went into overtime you were Punished for it rather than rewarded. TDM was part of the competitive set. There was also no real tournament support because of the lack of interest. I think there were single digit tournaments over the entirety of the games life that I can remember and they were mostly noncompetitive ones I won  of them being v on dome. You also had to play every map and a LOT of them were either huge awful or huge and awful. It was a fun game but just awful for competitive likely the worst in CoD history. ,CoDCompetitive,dgbg9wb,9,t5_2tvg8

11763275,0,t3_67s1q3,have your most aggressive player run kinetic because he can use shockwave most plus he should have the most engagements so the most kills and be able to get it.For camo Im a bit torn. You dont have to have an IQ of  to use it effectively and most of the time its a team decision or shotcaller anyways. The player just has to know how to use it sneaking behind enemy lines etc. For uplink it definitely helps to have the guy with the probably second most kills run it. For hardpoint its just like snd a team decision as I said.Imo you have to be smarter to use FTL jump effectively than camo. You can make sick plays with it. either use it to alleyoop no idea how to write that word with yourself in uplink use it in snd to fly high etc. Imo you need more quick smart decision making for it than for camo.Slowest player plays stryker then.,CoDCompetitive,dgtea8u,1,t5_2tvg8
