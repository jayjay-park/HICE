6156989,0,t3_3zrelr,I live in Evanston but used to live right around the corner from St. Andrews. Always thought that was a great location and deserved a better barrestaurant than the tired uninspired St. Andrews. Glad to see its finally gonna happen. I drive by here most mornings on my way to work and will def. stop by once its up and running. This is good news!,EdgewaterRogersPark,cyphhar,2,t5_2wcdo
