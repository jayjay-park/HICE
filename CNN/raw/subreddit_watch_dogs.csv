Youll be missing out on the gunplay a large amount of hacks etc. Theyve said missions have multiple approaches so I hope I can replay them to go at them from a different angle.

You should have run the setup first and then register the game a.k.a. use the CDkey which would let you install the game rather than just download it.Some websites sell just the CDkeys which let you download the game if you dont have the installation files. When you get Watch Dogs put the disk in first launch the setup and only after it asks for the CDkey put it in.Even after you have registered the game you can still install it from a CD just by launching the setup from the CD. It will often pop up steam origin or whatever is needed and just confirm that you have already registered the game but still install it from a CD.Note you often have to download a patch.

I also have that feeling of Meh its just a game. But when I have it in my hands I change my mind and play that bad boy for hours on end.,watch_dogs,chn8970,7,t5_2u884

1048327,0,t1_chneh3k,I cant answer for him but I can answer for myself No need to swap discs when you want to play another game. It makes it easier to enjoy all your games when you dont have to worry about discs. With discs you have to go look wherever you store your games and then think about what you want to play and take the disc and put it in your PS and start up the game. With digital downloads you just look at your list of games and go Ooh I think Ill play that one for a while. click X and youre now playing the game. If it isnt as much fun as you remembered it only takes  seconds to select and start another game.  When you take your PS over to a friends house you dont have to bring all your games. If you dont bring your PS or games but suddenly want to show your friend your game on his PS all you gotta do is log in with your user and download it. You will never lose or damage a game. If someone breaks into your house they may steal your  PS but they wont steal your  collection of games. No need to install from disc which can be quite slow.There are disadvantages too of course but theyre mainly economical. If you have a good job and choose to spend your money on games you probably dont care about not being able to sell your games or buy new games used or borrow games from your friends if it looks fun just buy it.,watch_dogs,chng6rn,4,t5_2u884

They do matter to me at least but only to an extent. Im getting this game on the PS so Im not worried about graphics. The way i see it having great graphics is simply a bonus. That said I dont fault those who honestly dont care one bit about graphics. There are many great games out there that have either terrible or subpar graphics but theyre still enjoyable.

Get the pump action grenade launcher and when you think you are close enough of the circle is really small start shooting EVERYTHING. Cars bushes buildings pretty much every hiding spot.

I wont argue semantics.gtAnd this is not enable and disabled. The majority of the things werent in the final game and they are not e stuff like people thinkCome on man... Are you serious? Final game? What are you saying? That the game never had these things to begin with? Because it did. Thats why this is all possible. If you look at the unpacked files youll notice everything is already there and unless youve added additional code that the game reads this isnt a mod. Its simply a patch. But wait!

1647986,0,t3_2d5zxp, They misrepresented their original product. You can make all the excuses you want but that is what they did. Settings leftover prove that they intentionally changed graphical settings. These settings are now enabled turned on by the Worse Mod. While you do point out that PC has mods...that is not the point you can make the argument that they had no idea about the hardware on the consoles. However on the PC this argument falls flat you make the best damn game possible and let the players decide at what resolution and graphical presets they want to render the game at. MORE ON THIS FURTHER DOWN If you have a lowmid end gpu. You will run the game relatively well. If you have a highend nVidia card...you do not get the performance you expect which out to be fps ultra presets. Forget about it if you have a AMD highend gpu. There latest patch talks about the stuttering that they have been unable to fix on highend cards.  The game came out and it was immediately obvious that there was something wrong. People that had pirated the game were having less problems than those that actually bought it. It was due to the requirement of UPLAY and it caused stuttering. Their response was very slow.A Now it was revealed that the game had been graphically downgraded. Their initial statement dismissed this and was not positive for the image of the game. Particularly considering the fact that people with highend cards were having more problems. People have spent a lot of money on those GPUs to get the best performance which is typically pfps along with ultra AA custom presets. So for these cards to still be experiencing problem is not positive for the game. B Furthermore there were separate comments made with regards to other games by ubisft. One was regarding Far Cry  console version being the same quality as PC ultra version...There is no way that is possible consoles will not be able to hit the performance that PCs can hit LinusTechTips video on five year old GPU. Similarity there is no way the quality on the PS will be the same as the Xbox One itll be a bit better. Here is what one frostbitedice developer had to say about it Then The Division devs also gave an interview and said that the game was going to be locked at fps. All this combined has created the hate wagon towards Watch Dogs and Ubisoft in general.,watch_dogs,cjmw4ly,1,t5_2u884

Damian eventually  cleaned him up and taught him how to breach a network. Damian also states that the reason Aiden does the whole vigilante thing is to try to deal with the death of his niece. The way I look at is Aiden isnt a good guy nor was he ever suppose to be. The vigilante thing was just an outlet for him which revealed what a violent horrible man he was hiding. I dont think he really cares about others or the city. Im sure he also has a lot going on his head that we dont know about which is a character development problem for sure. Personally I liked the character but I felt like there wasnt enough depth to him. Especially since many of the audio logs can only be found by doing the ctOS breaches,watch_dogs,czqgljg,4,t5_2u884

I do hope theres more worthwhile progression this time and some natural evolution to the gametypes. Also feel the design encourages glitching behaviour sometimes like it encourages you to fall into a hole between rocks and just camp it out or exploit some awkward piece of geometry. Would be good to see that unnecessary. Would like larger goals and also some finish with more personality than your adversary just vanishing from your world  like some flash screen with both avatars.Some good clips below    Love it when long chases ensue. Think evasion needs tweaking though as ten seconds after a burst of acceleration doesnt compensate the pursuer for their invested time  basically too easy to lose people  This character looks so much better than Aiden,watch_dogs,d4f87u7,1,t5_2u884

The bar for posts really just seems a tad overwhelming. I much prefer having the dark background that really makes all the bright text a lot prettier. And then there is the lack of the selection boxes around optionsposts. Kinda in between on the UpvoteDownvote. Not hating it but kinda lackluster if you havent selected either one. I do think its better that the TextMedia buttons arent so isolated anymore. PostsComments  And yes this is amazingly better. I find it easier to read comment points without having to highlight it. If I wasnt so illiterate I would have better ways to describe everything. My two issues is that for one the upvotedownvote circles arent full circles due to overlap from the comment. And then two the animation delay is kinda distracting if you move it from upvote to downvote and vice versa.So I dont really know what I would vote.

9804203,0,t3_5fk3ha,Ive got an interesting performance issue with WD that I havent seen mentioned elsewhere so I thought Id detail it here.My rig specs are available here tldr iK GTX  GB DDR. Short version WD gets double the FPS when installed to my secondary HDD rather than my primary SSD. This picture shows the realtime readings for my GPU usagepoweretc while running these tests. When I installed the game to my  RPM HDD my GPU would go up to  usage and I could get FPS. But when I installed the game to my primary SSD the one Windows and Uplay are installed to my GPU wouldnt go up to . It instead hovered around  and I could only get FPS. Very odd behavior.Installing WD back to the secondary slower drive literally resulted in nearly double the framerate. Im genuinely confounded as to how that is possible. EDIT Issue resolved. It turned out to be unrelated to the hard drives but to a setting on the WD executable file under the Compatibility tab for Disable Desktop Composition. It should be checked by default when installed but I had erroneously unchecked it. Installing to my SSD with this option checked with Windows Aero disabled results in full use of my GPU.

Its a game that requires you to take things slow enjoy the ambiance and puzzles and just experiment with little things over time and appreciate what you find. If you dont realize this a few hours in and get that click feeling Im afraid you might screw up the whole experience because theres no point rushing when youre not feeling it.

10414336,0,t1_dcihmal,Sorry for taking so long to reply. But I meant in terms of the multiplayer features and modes. Not just free roamThey got rid of the v pvp deathmatch and team deathmatch for a maximum  player sudden death. They removed  player free roam for a  player free roam.They completely got rid of online racing.And although tailing isnt completely missed it was still a really fun feature to just stalk and mess with people in. Honestly the only good thing that was added in the multiplayer of watchdogs  is the coop... Actually no. Thats not true because the coop was in the first Watch Dogs aswell. The second Watch Dogs just removed a bunch of multiplayer features for unnoticeable online joining. But if you ask me I would much rather have the other game modes than that. This is coming from someone who has  hours on the first watch dogs due to the multiplayer. I honestly think that the second watch dogs multiplayer is significantly more boring. I dont think i have more than  hours on the multiplayer of watch dogs . ,watch_dogs,dcoj6yq,1,t5_2u884

You can either rent a mini office or a desk and the point of the place is that you have a cheap alternative to owning your own office and also access to other entrepreneurs to bounce ideas off of.

My point is that... although far fetched a little... its something that isnt totally out of the realm of possibility and its interesting to see the negative impacts technology can have in the hands of the wrong people. ,watch_dogs,dfkeref,1,t5_2u884

11793176,0,t3_689cxh,Through modding its possible to fly one. There are actually two seats in the cockpit area although there isnt a model for the cockpit itself. Aiden can be seen on the drivers side when hes flying one and a passenger can be on the copilot side.I suspect they didnt add a pilot because it would have complicated things to do so. If you shot the pilot for example the helicopter would have to fall out of the sky and crash into stuff. This isnt really possible considering that the helicopter doesnt have real physics. Its more like slew mode in flight simulator with a feeling of inertia added. For example the helicopter could be upside down after hitting another vehicle and could still climb with the W key as if it were right side up. It can also fly forward with the nose pitched up if you fly it in a specific way. Basically the helicopter attempts to rotate to match the way its moving and not the other way around like properly simulated physics would do.Theres also the fact that it doesnt collide with the environment at all. It will go right through anything that isnt a car or person. It also lacks any sort of damage modeling which would be essential to see if the heli crashed into the ground.Finally we know how much the game was cut down visially. Rendering a cockpit and pilot would only be an added burden for the consoles albeit a minor one.,watch_dogs,dgwsodd,6,t5_2u884
11794983,0,t3_68a7w1,Grats! There were still enough people playing to do the online missions?  When it came out I got it on  but didnt have live so those were all I couldnt complete.
