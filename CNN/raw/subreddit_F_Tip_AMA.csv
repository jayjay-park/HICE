2259732,0,t3_2kz9ev,Wow great question. thanks for asking. truth is im not a troll. i just post my life stories and opinions on reddit when i feel like it and debate people about various things occasionally. but even so is what you and i post to reddit objectively more constructive towards our lives than a troll? you have been a redditor for  year and  months but since you havent been trolling that time wasnt wasted? how is spending time talking about video games and bull shit stories any less wasteful than antagonizing people on the internet like a troll would do. for my case not a troll i chose to come on this website occasionally when i have free time to do so. i happen to have made the account  months ago and have been coming on here since. now what is your excuse?,F_Tip_AMA,clr0va0,-14,t5_34a0c
