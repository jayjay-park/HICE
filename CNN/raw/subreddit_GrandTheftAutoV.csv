185657,0,t1_cezkm7k,Sorry for the huge wall Of text rant but some people just dont understand how games and gaming hardware work these days.People dont understand that increasing resolution scale doesnt compromise other aspects such as textures or draw distance. There were just some frame rate analysiss of bf posted today on digital foundry on a very low end graphics card amd r x where bf was on high settings and ran at p p and p. p was smooth fps  p only dropped to fps at high action moments but fps most of the time and p only dropped to fps at high action moments but fps most of the time. People automatically assume that increasing from  to  means you have to make all the textures super low res and remove lighting aspects and other things just to make games run smooth but just no modern game optimization and hardware optimizations means we dont have to make those compromises anymore. Also there will be a huge mantle amds game optimization language coming to bf soon and with this patch the game will probably run smooth fps on p on the very low end card tested. So with the sheer power of the next gens p fps with an increased draw distance and texture quality should be no sweat probably along with multiplied AI and traffic.,GrandTheftAutoV,cezl1i9,0,t5_2t0xk

219650,0,t3_1wmpm5,I think you take the few people complaining on here as how everyone feels. I for one would rather them space their new content out then blowing their load all at once. I also understand that they had to put stuff on hold to fix problems. While were at it lets talk about the micro transactions as im sure thats where you see them failing as well. While some companies places these micro transactions in games to help line their pocket R has more then likely added them for smart reasons. R has already stated that all DLC will be free that means there are people working day in and day out to create new content. Believe it or not they are not doing this all for free. GTA Online also requires servers to be ran and maintained constantly which again require money. Now i know what youre gonna say LukeNeverShaves they made a billion dollars. While you are correct you forget that that billion dollars goes to a lot of things among adding to the future DLC fund it is used for future games. While everyone is slaving away making the next R game they require a paycheck which will come from these funds. Not to mention that  months after a game is released its profits begin to shrink. Why you may ask? Used games. Yes that thing we fought so hard to keep for next gen eats into profits. Joe Schmo walks into Gamestop and picks up a new copy of GTA because his buddy said its amazing when he approaches the counter he is told by the associate we have a used copy of that for  less if youre interested he is. Boom R just went from getting  for their game to getting . Which means R has to put their game on sale to try and make some money off their game now. To say R is making rookie mistakes is a poorly thought out attempt at whining. R have been in this for YEARS and know what they are doing and what needs to be done to keep making games. Everything theyve done is carefully thought out and tweaked to be just right. Will fans still be there? Idk why dont you ask the people who buy BattlefieldCODMaddenect every year after complaining about it for  months prior if theyll be sitting outside a game store waiting for the midnight release next year. TLDR R are not amateurs and know what theyre doing. Fans will continue to support them even if you dont. ,GrandTheftAutoV,cf3gpj6,3,t5_2t0xk

You fly in low over the first building and position yourself so you fly down the road in front of the hangers heading west more or less in the center of the base. The first little hanger on the right has a jet right in front of it. You wont see it until you get close but its there every time. Land on the east side of the hanger run to get the jet and immediately drive straight south and pull up as fast as possible. I can consistently get out of the base with little to no small arms fire I have never even had to take a shot because there are no guards at that hanger. I have never even been shot at with a tank using this method as it usually takes a few seconds for them to spawn if you move fast. As soon as your over the fence drop altitude below tree tops and make a hard left around the base under the bridge if your a decent pilot then once your heading north keep on the right side of the mountain directly north of the base. You should have to dodge one or two missiles at most but by staying low they shouldnt be able to get a good shot due to the building on the east end of the base.

As he fell past the floor below a shotgun shell went through the window and hit him in the head blowing his brains out and killing him instantly. He then fell a further  feet onto a fire escape totalling a storey drop.The shotgun shell was fired by an old man brandishing his gun a family heirloom in a fight with his wife. Upon questioning by the police both the man and his wife agreed that the shotgun hadnt been loaded in years it was simply an ornament he would get down and wave around in arguments to each their own I suppose.While questioning other residents on the same floor one neighbour said he saw a man handling the shotgun a number of weeks before and thought nothing of it upon describing the man to the couple they identified him as their son. The couple had recently cut him off financially and he had been visibly distraught.When the police began to look for the couples son to inform him of what had happened they found that he was living above his parents without their knowledge and had snuck into their apartment and knowing that his father often took the gun off the wall and waved it around in an attempt at revengeloaded it in the hopes that he would kill someone.Having waited several weeks for a result and realising one was not forthcoming the man fell into deep depression and jumped out of his apartment window in an attempt at suicide only to have his brains blown out by a round he put into the gun with which someone else shot him in the head.The police couldnt decide if it was deliberate suicide accidental suicide or manslaughter by way of negligence. They fudged the paperwork and closed the case.,GrandTheftAutoV,cfakpdr,71,t5_2t0xk

In a parimutuel pool odds are dependent on where the money is  which is why you see the odds on your player change from say  to  after betting on him. Essentially youre betting against everyone else which differs from a fixed odds system where the house gives you set odds and assumes the risk of having to pay out the winners. Fixed odds would seem to work better with GTA online where not everyone is looking to bet.  ,GrandTheftAutoV,cfg4dr3,7,t5_2t0xk

487681,0,t1_cfvngmv,I think the one with michael freaking out is due to the stress and depression he experiences throughout the game. It happens frequently after the DeSantas leave him. post game if you choose the deathwish ending he restores a great relationship with his family and seems overall more happy. these cutscenes stop happening. however if you chose the something sensible ending they keep happening and I dont think his family dynamic is as great showing how much Trevors death impacted hims,GrandTheftAutoV,cfvpbf8,8,t5_2t0xk

The blast radius and range are more than enough for the guy riding it to get someone even a whole block away. It takes virtually no skill.

If the game can handle  pedestrians MAX that means it could handle  pedestrians and  animals.  Seeing that the animalspeople are only spawned when you are near them  that means that it could EASILY have animals especially if every player was out in the mountains.

500249,0,t3_1zuop2,Well I personally like the Entity.  There is a lot of testing to back up this being the best super car.  Truthfully an Adder Entity or the Turismo are all pretty equal in performance one is better with acceleration another has better top end another handles really well.Go into single player and order up some cars to test out.  Find the one that you like the most.  I have lost in my entity to drivers in Vaccas so a huge part of it is driver skill.If you do not have a super I would say to check out that Turismo it is a nice looking car and it has nice performance and at a realistic price point... K as opposed to k or a cool Mill for the Adder.

Which would take you aruond you  minutes which is  odd hours..  Jesus actually quite a bit of grinding so effectively making . worth IRL moeny via buying sharkcards per hour that you can grind in game.. currently. Or you can get a job in the real world for whats the minimum wage in the US gotta be x that about similar to in the UK where i guess that same sharkcard is just over  or sumfin.i couldnt see why people bought shark cards. now maybe i do a bit.. but its pretty exploitave of r by the looks of that math not that im a stats guy or some mathematician mother fucker. lolmill is a lot of ingame cash but for the cost of the game again your not gettin half the content that you got for the first just under  you paid for the game... who made the most sales on day  of any highstreet product didnt they? the whole time ive played ive got like just over  mil probably a few mil from doing the glitch probably and a good  mil probably more from doing playlists with higher paying missions k and the other few mil or so from general shit. ive played the game slightly more than average at a guess.... using  IRL money to  ...  of my money.... i just dont ... get it. i wouldnt think of it lol its a lot of money for the game itself which was an expensive i miss the  days and then  before the next edition came out a couplefew years later. now im paying  for a few months months of in game cash so i dont have to think about how im managing money in game? a game thats been all about blowing cash and being gangster? lol r are cleeeevvveeeeerrr. got on that money printing game. hooked up a money printer to the vitrual reality. taking note of that stanford prison experiment and dat stockholme syndrome is real useful. an orwellian futurists wet dream ,GrandTheftAutoV,cg6fugb,23,t5_2t0xk

587012,1,t1_cg6vtd0,That happened to me once. I was going to the base and died on first attempt some nearby person destroyed my car I was using personal. They too were trying to get a jet. I spawned and got a jet first the other person didnt seem to fully understand evading the NPC jet that trys to kill you after leaving the base at first. Got my jet and stalked the army base and flew around it killing that dude  times with the cannons. They got a jet and I shot em down once. Said into the mic something like that was for my car and flew off.Now normally Ill fly a jet around for people to be like yo is that a jet? howd you get a jet??? and just dick around in the air raising my flying skill. Saw someone in a chopper and normally I start this whole Uhhhhhh unidentified air vehicle please identify yourself or you WILL be shot down.And then either shoot them down or just fly around em for practice. Then out of no where I hear the missile lockon sound and I am shot down from seemingly nothing. Turns out the other person who I shot down had taken off their blip and came up from behind. Ok no biggie kind of a hassle to get another so Ill move onto something else.  Nope. Captain Revenge comes back and kills me on the beach. Circles around real quick and kills me again. Put on passive mode and he flew so low it hit me. Pretty impressive really to be THAT low. Didnt kill me cause Id say hed have to hit me like  times in passive mode.He flew off and I went to the apartment to watch TV to see what hes up to after I got slaughtered. See him do some really strange moves in a jet. Like really choppy up and down movements. Lag? No its not rubberbanding its something else.... Meanwhile at the same time the jet has somehow lost its cockpit glass covering and I notice the person flying it is blinking alot. Like invincibilitycheat blinking. I got out my phone to record it and hopefully send it to rockstar for some ban hammer action. File was too big for email and I didnt feel like getting on youtube to upload a movie and then send that link to youtube to rockstars email. Not at am when I had been up like  hours past my normal bedtime.Oh well.,GrandTheftAutoV,cg6zwyr,0,t5_2t0xk

I was able to sell one but not the other and eventually the one I didnt sell disappeared.

932852,0,t1_chab6tz,Point  It took them  weeks after the release not months. You base you judgment on what? The crashes and char deletion? Its funny how EVERY MMO game that was released in the last years got the same SERVER OVERLOAD problems...Point  Mission payouts have not been lowered each patches. They lowered the payout on a lot of missions that were too easy to farm in two minutes and earned as much money as a  minutes one and IMO it is fair. Lets all admit it...  for a mission as easy as Rooftop Rumble is too much.I can agree with the SEPARATE and Unranked freeroam where there is no cash no property no levels nothing.

In other words it would take less bandwith to keep it synchronized with other players.As long as there is disk space its possible to simulate more and more scenery.

1150890,0,t3_27arl1,Only real gripe I have is the lack of control over matchmaking. Would much prefer some way of seeing what jobs were open at any given time and with what settings so I dont get dropped into  creator races doing a freeway lap around all of San Andreas with catch up and slipstream on.Like sure whatever if people want to drive in a straight line for ten minutes its no skin off my back but Id like a better way to find those that dont. Instead I think those of us interested in more niche or skilled racing are spread thin across things we dont necessarily want to do.And before someone says host your own jobs!  of course! But what I want to do is just as onerous to the Long Haulers as Long Haul is to me.On the other hand I think the lack of control is good in a way in that it sort of gives incentive for people to try other things and gives dropins to people hosting creator content that otherwise might not get played. And despite the proliferation of facile highway races and big ramps there is a lot of fantastic creator content  some of which is much better than what R offers I think.,GrandTheftAutoV,chz382c,2,t5_2t0xk

1211284,0,t1_ci5vtda,Exactly the game is either all on the disk or hard drive making it faster because when youre pulling from both the disk and hard drive at the same time on last gen you had slow delays because reading from disks is really really slow and the hard drive tech used in last gen was also very slow but the new hard drives and disc drives in the new systems are very fast. So drawing from one fast form of memory is way faster and stabler compared to last gen where you had to pull from  slow forms of memory which both had different speeds making load times slow and unpredictable.,GrandTheftAutoV,ci5vyx7,2,t5_2t0xk

It should be fairly obvious by now that they will likely be coming out  between late September and early November likely to be timed with the release of the new versions. Thats my prediction. Itll likely help boost sales of V. and give users an appreciation for the new features and graphics of the game. If we view the initial release of GTA V as a beta with the updates such as High Life as kind of tests for rolling out DLC what works what doesnt work then we can view the upcoming release as the full release. At that point its available to EVERYone its a good time to release the biggest initial DLC for your game  when no one has had a chance to play it yet but everyone can now experience it at the same time.,GrandTheftAutoV,ci9wrni,2,t5_2t0xk

No of course notAnd actually thats wrong. Depending on the situation. What if you were in med school and your grade put you ahead of him and you got the best internship or whatever.

1492574,0,t3_2b7cvj,I usually just grind out races deathmatch or missions. Also do a lot of gang attacks for some quick cash and RP. Ill also find Griefers or anyone that attackskills me and set up traps for them. My personal favorite is to take my pink Panto intentionally flip it over  sticky bomb the bottom go into passive and then go find a bastard park near him and get out. I like to follow them in passive while they try to get into shootouts with other players. When they take cover or go off radar I intentionally give away their position. Then almost every time if they get pissed enough at me they will try and blow up my panto or steal it. I wait until they get close to it go out of passive and detonate the bombs under the car that they had no clue were there.  Not cost effective  But they panto is pretty cheap to replace and totally worth it to kill someone like thatBut anyway I had the same problem until I got recruited into a new crew. Id recommend that. There are like  ppl in my crew over half of which are PS players. And out of the Xbox guys I tend to play with the same  or  people so theyre becoming friends for sure. Id definitely head over to rgtacrews or whatever its called and find a crew that has similar interests and join.,GrandTheftAutoV,cj3dah8,1,t5_2t0xk

Northern SA is the other part with SF. Also they did say that they wanted to add new locations to GTA O but they have disk size limitations. So maybe they will package northern SF with maybe a new trio or keep these guys i see a few ways they can still use them and a smallish story and add lots more to GTA O. Then maybe create a separate disk for LG users to get all this content.And another thing the trailer sort of stayed away from the Paleto Bay area so anything could happen. Land was seen in some post card of Paleto Bay too. Theres a shit ton of evidence in this thread on gtaf  scroll down a bit the post is by ivarblaauw.

1578583,0,t1_cje4wlq,I have the GTA V ISO downloaded for the sole purpose of file hunting Maybe port some to GTA SA when Im bored too and I can say it is difficult.For example GTA Vs audio is in a .awc archive and isnt openable by LibertyV and the only .awc archive extractor I found was for PS so I spent about a hour trying to figure out how to open them before I found out OpenIV can open the archives and extract them all to a folder in a .wav format. The models are a pain to convert. Some guy Cant spell his name made a xdrobj converter and I cant work it right. I did find a batch file someone made which should convert all .xdr.xdd files to .obj and everytime I run it I just get some Magic Mismatch error and it crashes or produces a kb .obj file.  DKPAC A well known GTA SA modder made a tool similar to it called xdrdff GTA SAs model file format and like xdrobj it just crashes. If I use cars weapons or peds. | With the GTA V Console Texture viewer viewing textures is really easy.  You can export the textures in a .dds format so to edit them youll need a DDS to TGA converter or a plugin for Photoshop. I already found some hidden yet random pictures of Michael Trevor and Amanda.  Seensins actually has original individual files uploaded such as the DLC and Xbox  instaltion disc files etc. ,GrandTheftAutoV,cje5j8u,3,t5_2t0xk

1773061,0,t1_ck2anci,I always thought it was interesting how parking a tank on a god moder killed them. Its always so great to do then you just grief the holy living shit out of them cause lets face it if youre using a god mode glitch you suck ass at the game. I almost wish it didnt kill them though. An interesting thing about the tank is that unlike just about any other vehicle if you get stuck under it your character doesnt just magically teleport more of a weird slide out from under it. So if they couldnt die from it you could indefinitely trap them D you could just park it on them and sorta just hop out and walk away. I got the idea when I actually did it once by accident. This douche bag was in god mode and he ran as he saw what I was doing. I managed to get him under the tank but it was weird. He was next to a wall of sorts and I managed to pin him in the corner. Something about the positioning managed to keep him under there without actually killing him. It was amazing! I sent him a message asking if he was having fun under there and he obviously responded with rage. Anyway sorry to ramble thats what I do for the most part to. Have fun goofing off with friends doing missions. If Im not with them then I usually just fly my Cuban  around swooping over peoples heads and just kinda cruising. I do that until and this usually doesnt take too long some asshole shoots at me. I mean its obvious I couldnt do anything to harm someone in a Cuban  meaning theyre just attacking for no reason and so I just kinda make them my target. Ill keep flying around them just having fun swooping over them until they actually manage to damage the plane to the point of smoking and sputtering. At that point I paratroop down and go on to kill them repeatedly. If they leave I just kinda repeat from the point of grabbing a new Cuban . Anyway man sorry to ramble even further. Have fun with the game ,GrandTheftAutoV,ck2nduc,2,t5_2t0xk

It only stopped when I died and the cops literally blocked off the highway with a dozen inert cars and even then thanks to the bulletproof glass it took a few minutes for them to shoot the driver to death.

And then wasnt even good enough to manage to finish the mission without everyone dieing including him. If you are going to be that much of a dick about disliking some one at least dont be so lame as to need the person to finish the mission.

If you drive that uninsured car into your garage youll receive a free tracker. The tracker shows you where your car is when you exit it nothing more. If you drive that stolen liberated car straight to a LSC you have to pay for Tracker first then Full Coverage to be completely protected. If you buy a car online via one of the two available websites your car comes with both a tracker and full coverage as well  so theres nothing more for you to do.

Nope.  Nothing but a ton of high level dudes in jets.  Just kept asking them if it was a Besra.  One guy crashed trying to respond amp two bailed out of their Lazers to call up a Besra.  There was just one guy in a Lazer hovering over Sandy Shores Airstrip so that no Pegasus vehicles could spawn not to mention how many drops are in the north part of the map amp he would have total control of the air.  Crate drop was getting closer so he goes off radar amp starts heading towards me in a Buzzard around Maze Bank building so I haul ass towards him gambling the drop will be up there.  The drop is right off of Sandy Shores Airstrip amp I hear him near me.  I go off radar amp get into the drop zone while I see a jet crashing down north of the drop.  I get out of my chopper amp walk over to the crate taking slight fire from the NPCs.  Other guy cleans up the rest of the NPCs amp aims at me but cant fire.

2434216,0,t3_2ndcua,Those lucky shots are the best.  Yesterday I found myself on top of one of the buildings at the Las Santos Airport in the middle of a giant freeforall fire fight.  One guy had a buzzard and was shooting down every plane that attempted an escape.  I just was hoping to maybe take him down with enough hits with the heavy sniper to at least force him to land before getting killed.  On the third shot though I managed to score a direct hit right through the cockpit window killing him instantly tis was a nice feeling.,GrandTheftAutoV,cmckprc,6,t5_2t0xk

They didnt want to release a halfarsed oldgen version of the game on PC so waited until they could make it in line with the currentgen version that we were waiting for.

Not really matchmaking just invites.And then you have the people who click the join job button in the phone.  Thats matchmaking and sure thats broken but we really should do a poll to see how many people actually use that feature because more often than not it dumps you in rockstar races and not personal ones and everyone is always using supers so why bother doing it anymore?  The DMs I like to make and playwell thought out balanced maps with good weapon placement and strategic routes almost never come up when clicking join DM.That could be bad matchmaking or it could be no one uses the feature.If that makes me naive this makes you a condescending ass.Plus my comment was being flippant.

2667211,0,t1_cn6pvd6,Yeah well didnt have much choice since her account doesnt have Gold and Im not willing to buy Gold for a second account lol. And yeah she makes friends fast too but thats only because theyre girls. They see a girl playing and if theyre a beta virgin they get the urge to help them. Like the first game I got her into was Red Dead Redemption and she loved it mostly because of the horse riding. She played on her own account at that time because she had the free month of Gold. She made friends with this guy and hed spend heaps of time playing with her to help her level up faster. They even know she has a boyfriend and theres been a few times where this guy and his friend would call her beautiful or something even though they havent seen her and shed just be like um you know I have a boyfriend and hes sitting right here.But heres the best part. He ended up adding her on Facebook so she could tell him when she wants to play the guy looked like an absolute tool with no friends and posted really weird statuses. But of course he ended up messaging her trying to start conversations and flirt with her. She ignored him most of the time and hed spam her until she replied like a typical virgin who doesnt know how to talk to girls. So I messaged him basically saying learn to take a hint if shes not replying she doesnt wanna talk. He got really offended and started messaging me stuff like calling me a little boy even though Im older than him and making threats to come to my country to kill me. It was hilarious.After that my girlfriend is very wary of who she decides to add as a friend on Xbox Live. ,GrandTheftAutoV,cn6q9fs,2,t5_2t0xk

2672632,0,t1_cn6yr3v,It is pretty sad. Look at my posts. I said that MS and Sony should be giving them the service that they pay for. And  kids shouldnt be able to take down the that they pay for. What do they do? They downvote the shit out of me! Lol. This is why MS and Sony will not learn from Lizard Squads attacks. Nobody in the console community puts their foot down to these companies. The only time they showed any criticism was when MS had always online DRM. The funny thing is that their criticism worked but they still didnt learn from it.I guarantee that SonyMS will get DDOSed again and and all the console fanboys will go full circle with the whining.,GrandTheftAutoV,cn7foy1,1,t5_2t0xk

2722334,0,t1_cnde7ic,As I said Im not a fan of waiting for more RP per mission either but in a way it does make sense I am not claiming you will earn more RPhour by waiting.    Even if you can finish the mission itself quickly for each mission you will lose time with matchmaking and loading screens. You will not earn x as much money per hour if you finish the mission in  minutes instead of  because you have to go through the loading screens more often. And of course you also get a bit more money per minute mission compared to minute missions. If loading screens took much longer or if the added minute was much higher waiting could be the fastest way to earn  but in this case its not.    So yes I know that the fastest mission tempo will give you the most money per hour Rockstar even said so on their newswire.    However when were talking about wasting more time it really depends on what you like most in the game. I think the time lost in matchmaking and loading screens is much less enjoyable lost than the time fooling around an extra  minutes per mission.      So if you wait   you will get less RPhour. Do not use the waiting strategy if you are grinding for RP or money. you get more playing timehour less loading screenshour so do use the waiting strategy if you prefer a bit more effective playing time compared to a bit more RP per hour. you will probably annoy some people for stalling.    I do not like the waiting strategy but if someone on your team is fooling around you better make the best out of it I suppose it can be a nice change of pace when you have been grinding for a while.    After all its a game you play with people you dont know so you cant really expect others to enjoy it the same way as you do. However the people who think that waiting  minutes per mission is really the fastest way to earn money are just dumb.,GrandTheftAutoV,cndin7n,2,t5_2t0xk

Ive often had a mission fail once or twice because I didnt want to switch thinking they had some contingency plan that would happen along the way.  For example if you dont switch to Franklin when Micheal is trapped at the dog food plant.  Micheal will be stuck on the hook till hes eventually put through a grinders.  Also the Three Man Army achievement can only be unlocked while on a hangout with the three of them and in case you didnt know you cant switch while in hangout mode.,GrandTheftAutoV,cnf0oca,1,t5_2t0xk

We compared it to MP and LA Noire who didnt have info about PC till  weeks before and we were so pumped.The game may very well turn out to be great but the damage is done  Im sure people will still buy it but they would have lost a few potential ones.,GrandTheftAutoV,cnnnesh,2,t5_2t0xk

In addition the city being poorly laid out the game had several game breaking glitches that most have forgotten by now.

I dont remember if the race type GTA Noncontact makes any difference but I dont think it did.Also when you are grinding races try out all the cars in a given class.

3325431,0,t1_cp79l8c,While I both understand your point and have never played as a girl except when the game required it e.g. Tomb Raider I can understand in some cases its just a fun thing to do in the role playing approach the game can offer. Kind of like a very very violent The Sims. A couple of my girls many characters on The Sims were dudes but on GTA she plays women only maybe just because of the nature of the game. I guess you can just role play like I role played a witcher even though Im no alchemistwizardhunter called Geralt. My girl also made for a great Geralt of Rivia and it wasnt weird for her even though the guy likes to bang everything that moves.I do however get the impression that some dudes just have a wicked fantasy of waking up in their bed one day only to find like in some cheese s magical body swap movie that they have boobs and its not weird to play with themselves anymore. Ive honestly heard guys making quite good impressions of fake female voices and other dudes thinking its a real girl just flocking around and flirting the most surreal shit the same way it used to happen to my girl at first every time she used the mic. Ive also noticed that the skankier the faker almost no real girls dress like hookers in the game judging by my experience so far. Ive only seen one classy girl that turned out to be a guy now a friend of mine. Ive only seen one real confirmed girl dressed like skank but it kinda fir her personality. That girl had some stories... real life friends of her were there to confirm... you cant unhear what has been heard...Anyway theres a lot of wirdos out there and I can understand why you think its sad.,GrandTheftAutoV,cp7bs2o,4,t5_2t0xk

3372244,0,t1_cpcnc07,That sucks but it is a problem with playing with randoms more than the heist mechanism. Its the same playing single missions but then it matters less  its easy to quit and move on.Think of free roam. How many players will sit on top of a building taking potshots with a sniper rifle at people outside their apartment? How many players will see you coming past in a car and try to shoot you as you pass? How many players will drive past see you standing at the side of the road and run you down just because? How many players see you are in the clothes shop block the door and shoot you inside?Those are the randoms that you are trusting with your heist order.,GrandTheftAutoV,cpcnsox,12,t5_2t0xk

K guns per K people does not mean KK own guns. Its more like K and if only counting adults. Cars a bit more distributed. From your wiki source Despite concerns that it contains systematic errors the Small Arms Survey  provides an estimate of the total number of known civilianowned guns in a country per  people of that country.The figures are distorted by two facts . People may possess multiple firearms as is common in the USA and . In various countries such as Israel and Switzerland a significant number of civilians have in their possession for decades governmentowned guns which would not be included in the figures below.

Its like other vehicles just arent even there and its even better when you literally blow one up by ramming it so hard. And another funny thing is that most dont even think to use an actual God damn gun to kill you when youre in it. Its just a barrage of explosives. The other thing I love about it is that I can give people a chance without worth of death. I start peaceful with other players and then when they sticky bomb or shoot at me for no reason I just obliterate them until they leave.

3619888,0,t1_cq4vgmo,When you post mostly in a GTA and other video game communities AND you moderate one you pretty much have to be ok with downvotes.  The gaming community is full of A LOT of toxicity and then when you add in the anonymity of the internet you have a recipe for disaster.I cant say with certainty that your statement is correct since I personally dont know what everyone who plays GTA plays it on but I can say its a good possibility that you are correct.  I mean the game has been out on consoles for a year so that is to be expected.  We do have a lot of good people also who just want to talk about GTA and dont give a shit which platform it is on.Console things get heavily downvoted also and sadly there really isnt anything we can do about it.  You can quote reddiquette about downvotes until you are blue in the face but that doesnt mean anyone will listen to you.  You can also disable the downvotes via CSS but everyone knows how well that works.We could put the subreddit into constant contest mode but thats just a bandaid because then you run the risk of having to see shit that should be downvoted and TBH I dont think it affects anything but comments even if its enabled.,GrandTheftAutoV,cq4w6sa,0,t5_2t0xk

I have to give it about five minutes in order for it to boot up properly.Here are three screenshots of from Speed Fan the first one is right when I boot the computer up the second is about five minutes into the game and the third one is after the computer is booted up from the crash.As Ive stated before Ive never experienced anything like this before with any game Ive played in the past.,GrandTheftAutoV,cqchyx8,1,t5_2t0xk

3730395,0,t3_333csh,ITT nobody realizes that this is a throwback to the original thing that started gta.gtLong before the Grand Theft Auto series became the gold standard in video game mayhem simulators Rockstar Games back then known as DMA Design was working on a racing game called Race and Chase. The idea was to produce a fun addictive and fast multiplayer car racing and crashing game which sounds like it could be Mario Kart until you see what it looked likegtIf there was ever a game in need of a bit of attitude this was it.gtEagleeyed viewers will notice a stark similarity between the above screen shot and the original GTA series that isnt a coincidence. As far as the play testers were concerned the game sucked except for one glitch which made the police in the game go apeshit for no reason. Instead of politely pulling you over the cops would ram you off the road their AI was accidentally trying to drive through the player. Suddenly everyone was crashing nonstop.gtPlay testers thought this was freaking hilarious and in fact abandoned the missions just to screw around and see what kind of mayhem they could cause. The designers decided to not only leave the psychotic cops in there but build the entire game around the kind of ridiculously violent car chases caused by the glitch.gtThe game was eventually completely overhauled to create Grand Theft Auto. By the time Grand Theft Auto  came around a few years later the series was one of the most influential ever. It would go on to revolutionize open world gameplay that now seemingly half of the games on the market try to emulate. But at its heart its still all about the joy of abandoning the objective and just dicking around. All because nobody knew how to properly program a video game policeman.,GrandTheftAutoV,cqhhmi7,2,t5_2t0xk

Yes absolutely. Its been an issue ever since the game was released. A lot of players feel like having infinite money doesnt give them a competitive advantage just lets them buy fun stuff to mess around with in free mode.

3788030,0,t3_33s8b2,Yesterday i was playing with two mentaly challanged individuals. I was lucky to join at the heist itself instead of doing the setup missions. The heist is called Pacific standard everything goes normal. We get out of the bank and make our way towards the ally. A few minutes in someone dies. Alright maybe they didnt have any armour. Supposedly these kids still dont understand the concept of snacks and how essential it is to heists or any other mission. Someone keeps on dying over and over again. I try to keep my patience and still play along. We finally make it to the bike section. One guy is already on one of the bikes. And three of us were trying to grab some armour. I shoot all of the crates. Some dumbass in the group who died a billion times before thought it was a splended idea to use a rocket launcher to blow up two crates with armour at  feet away. Guess what? He dies and we start over at the bank again. At this juncture you could tell they were frustraded and started to rush the mission. They kept on dying because these guys were reckless. After this whole debacle someone managed to get more pissed than me and finally left. That was my wakeup call and decided to join him as well.

3830054,0,t3_345bzr,I know of at least one thing to alleviate some of your issues Start the game up in singleplayer then go to Online Play GTA Online then start a CrewFriendInvite only session. Empty games of this nature take a lot less time to load overall as it doesnt have to load other players in the same session. You can still send and receive invites without issue as they are rarely confined to the session itself and in time you will get spammed with all sorts of invites anyway.With regards to freezing do note that when you first encounter certain aspects online like entering your first garage or various stores it locks your camera and displays some text in the upper left. You cant skip past it or do anything while this is happening unfortunately. Apparently Rockstar thinks we read things at the pace of a toddler. Whether or not this is related to the freezes you are experiencing I couldnt tell you but the amount of time you have to wait to get past these screens could certainly make everything else seem frozen or unresponsive.,GrandTheftAutoV,cqsux7k,1,t5_2t0xk

You can be friends with a girl without hitting on her  so no is obviously the answer. Can you consider that my defensiveness comes from having to see this same friendzone shit in my inbox all day long? Its just exhausting and its sad that so many people are blocking themselves from having a friendship with someone of the opposite gender and taking it out on us.

4359273,0,t3_3aws7t,I bought the Hydra. Its so damn useful! It spawns on helicopter pads for me at least. Im on  and theres always one nearby. It makes those purple Lester areas a breeze.The handling is... weird. It accelerates very slowly. However once you hit top speed its insane! The handling isnt as twitchy as the Laser. I actually prefer it to the Laser because I dont overcorrect in it. It just feels right to me. Just know that in a dogfight situation with an equally skilled player a Laser would win.The handling in hover mode is a different story. Its sluggish and a bit unresponsive. However in heli mode it can still go damn quick in a strait line.TIP stay near the downtown core in public lobbies. Weaving between buildings is an excellent way to escape missiles and give yourself cover.But if you want to flaunt your wealth the Osiris is a good choice. Also that new gullwing car can be made to look like a rally racer so if thats your thing it would be worth your while. My personal favourite expensive car is the Topless Coquette Classic. Looks sexy as fuck.TIP CHECK LIFEINVADER FOR DISCOUNTSAccess it via the R Social Club. For example if you stalk Warcache you get  off of your next purchase well you still need to have the full amount you just get  back. Sleazy as fuck but money back is money back. For the Hydra that amounts to  back in your account. I assume Legendary Motorsports has the same thing.,GrandTheftAutoV,csh0up3,1,t5_2t0xk

Keep in mind that the first car you choose is probably the one that is going to get you through all the missions you do for money so you can buy that chromed Adder with red wheels you want. When you finally get your car focus in performance before looks. If you spend k in a pretty paintjob and a spoiler instead of bulletproof tires and performance upgrades then youre gonna have a hard time both in missions and free roam. Get bulletproof tires. Yes theyre expensive but theyre a necessity specially in free roam.Online mode is to play alone at least in free roam. Every single player will kill you on sight no questions asked.Get only the guns you actually need and avoid spending extra money in useless modifications. You may think your rifle looks cool in bright pink it doesnt but maybe a scope or an extended magazine would help you more.Join heists setups and stick around for the finales. You may get lucky if someone decides to be generous with the payouts. Join as many jobs as you can with the Quick Job feature from your phone but avoid the  amp RP ones theyre all a scam.If you manage to amass a good quantity of money get a highend apartment so you can host your own heists.

4421715,0,t1_cso1ksa,Yep. Although i do believe we are entitled to a working product. So when considering the amount of players on the platform Im on even on a good connection  it takes  minutes to join a random session only to find players disconnecting immediately thats when Im bothered. I know its Rockstars game but when they spend time fixing issues that dont harm anyone including Rockstar instead of fixing actual exploits thats when they become ridiculous. I.e. fixed an issue that caused the hood to stay up even when no mask or hat is equipped removed the rat rod from players garages because it wasnt meant to be there even with all the customization options for it removed the neon option from the dune what vehicle was that with the rag on top because it wasnt meant to have it the list goes on for miles. And to anticipate a rebuttal they did say during the gate launched glitch fad we will not patch glitches that dont affect other players in a bad way or something to that effect. It seems that Rockstar goes out of their way needlessly patching problems instead of pushing more time to fix actual problems like match making heist lobbies lost car glitches which have been a problem since online release and single player. This is where i believe that calling into question the idea guys or whoever is responsible for patching those problems thinking into question is warranted. ,GrandTheftAutoV,cso297m,1,t5_2t0xk

Additionally heists were advertised as a main selling point of the game so there would have been a major shit storm if they tried charging for that.Ive received over mil in the last couple weeks from hackers and Ive never had more fun with the game until this point. I dont feel obligated to run missions when all I want to do is hop in a lobby with a couple buddies and dick around in free roam. Ive been able to pick up all the cars I want and mod them to look how I want and I can call in any of the pegasus vehicles I want on a whim too.

4734556,0,t1_ctonn0h,I almost solely fly helicopters. If you think dodging a rocket is impossible in GTA I promise you that its not. uthecoffee offered a good technique to use among just generally well dodging the missile...I mentioned that I occasionally fly in ARMA as well. Now theres a game where its possible but seemingly impossible to dodge a guided missile. Ive had zero success with it but have friends who can at least most of the time. In GTA the only time a rocket catches me is if Im not paying attention or very close to the person who launched it. Its very easy to make the missile lose track of you with evasive maneuvering not to mention the plethora of buildings and other cover that you can use to take the missiles explosion instead of your heli or use to evade the lock.Edit I did a quick YouTube search to see if I could find any helpful videos for you guys having troubles and theres tons... I didnt take the time to sift through them but this showed up twice in the top  or at least it had the same preview image the link provided being the first video that popped up for my search and is around two minutes longer than the other.Quick Second Edit I actually use a lot of these techniques. Flying toward the rocket is sometimes your best or only option sometimes its rapidly descending or possibly damaging your heli by flying into cover. Its better than being blown to bits and worst case scenario you get a suicide instead of giving the person a gratifying kill  also costing them money in ammo. Another quick tip is to adjust your altitude according to how many possible threats are on your minimapradar. If a blip is hauling ass to catch up to my heli or a blip stops abruptly as if theyve gotten into position to AA I fly low and between buildings using them as cover. If I absolutely have to and I guess this is better than suicide or suicide by entering a situation I know Im not prepared for negligence Ill disengage and reengage on my own terms.,GrandTheftAutoV,ctrc0d7,2,t5_2t0xk

Then you could jack the space shuttle and either fly it up and then fly it low like a plane or you could fly it really high and hit the edge of space. Obviously thered be absolutely nothing to find up there but it would be fun just to jump out in an astronaut costume or to reenter and see flames and heat as you burn into the atmosphere.I cant imagine it being too much of a waste of development resources. Just have it act like a verticallyflying LazerHydra and have the sky get progressively darker as you go over the maximum flight ceiling of the other planes. Then add some sort of flames when coming back down and BOOM done.They probably wont ever do it though as the lowerend news media and the less intelligent people of the world will accuse them of making a ColumbiaChallenger Simulator.

5067767,0,t1_cuwp9t7, PLEASE DOWNVOTE THE GUY ABOVE ME HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT.First off I have delved into modifying games with NPCs before.  I used to be really into Unreal Tournament which had bots monsters etc and from a game server perspective an NPC non player character is the same no matter what it is.  It can be a cop it can be a pedestrian it can be a dog it can be a cow. When you have players in GTAO you have pedestrians traffic and cops spawning all over the place.  When you are up in the mountains you have the occasional hiker but mostly you have nothing.  Let us assume that the max server load on the PS for example is  players and  NPCs.  This could explain why during an epic cop battle traffic basically disappears as it is being used up entirely by cops in cars swat teams helicopters etc.  HOWEVER.If everyone in GTAO was up in the mountains there is literally NO FUCKING REASON we cant have animals spawn.And if you dig even deeper animals will tax the system less than pedestrians and cops as they do not have accessories.  They dont have  different hats  different shirts they arent carrying cell phones or coffees they are just animals there is only ONE model with no accessories and very limited audio clips.   Animals use even less memory and less server power than pedestrians.So why then has Rockstar chosen to keep them out?That is a good fucking question I have no answer for but the guy above me is  wrong and does not know what he is talking about and is spouting bullshit as fact.,GrandTheftAutoV,cuwuvgg,-20,t5_2t0xk

The only militaries that still use it are third world countries and even then its only Bulgaria and Brazil. Brazil doesnt count because its only used for ceremonies and when was the last time either of those countries got into a warconflict. Also why dont you look up the military budget of those countries. The . would operate exactly like the musket but with two shots. That would make it a weapon that could actually kill at close range but if you missed youd be screwed. It would make sniper duels completely unfair unless it had serious handicaps when was the last time you saw a marksman pistol dominate close range combat.

I cant stand it and neither can anyone else. People have uninstalled the game and havent touched it again because of this bull.

They all USED to be  until greedy console marketers though of the idea to start charging for DLC and mods remember Oblivion?. Thankfully Valve learned that lesson with Half life Episodes. Notice how all the long lived online communities were supported with free content because that used to be the norm?  Quake  Warcraft  CounterStrike Team Fortress.When you downgrade your standards you downgrade the community at large.

5471763,0,t1_cwa78af,Technically you dont need anything but everyones idea of fun will always be different. People have different aspirations some people want to train hard in video games and become more experience and some people find fun in grinding and spending their virtual currency on meaningless items.  Others play just because its a fun game. For me I typically dont care about payouts sometimes and often am generous with splitting payment cuts during heists however I understand why money is important to others and for my own personal achievements. Believe it or not people find enjoyment in all different aspects of video games. Why else would people knowingly choose to play extremely difficult games? Sure it seems unfun to us but its all about perspective. Grinding is unfun exclusively to you which is probably due to you not finding the luxury of fulfilling achievements in some particular games which is ok!. ,GrandTheftAutoV,cwb2i5m,1,t5_2t0xk

Spoiler more closely resembles that of the STi. In fact theyre almost an exact match. Grill and foglights matches the evo. Kurumba and STi have a small window behind the rear door window. The Evo does not. Headlights are all very similar but the Evo and Kurumba are the closer match.The following are based off these imagesKurumba Evo STi The Kurumbas taillights are most similar to the Evo The numberplate however is on the back of the trunk like the STi. The Kurumbas diffusor is most similar to the STi. The Kurumba and STi also have  dualexit exhausts unlike the Evo. The basic shape and side profile of all  cars are extremely similar.SummaryThe Kurumba is a combination of the Evo X and  STi. Its neither one nor the other. Stop fighting about which one it is its both.EDIT Fixed spelling of Kuruma. Ay kurumba!!!!,GrandTheftAutoV,cxk9w4d,5,t5_2t0xk

The new armored vehicles can withstand some explosions before being destroyed  the kuruma cant withstand any if you or your passenger shoot out or give someone the finger that window is rolled down  thats not an issue in the kuruma with enough bullets the armored glass breaks  thats not an issue in the kuruma with enough bullets into the car I tested engine area the new vehicles will catch on fire and blow up  thats not an issue in the kuruma inside the new armored vehicles youre completely safe against limited fire no matter what angle the enemy is at  at certain angles inside the kuruma you can easily be killed finally these new vehicles look and perform differentHope that helps but with the extra garage spaces I strongly suggest trying one or more.

James grew up in Vice City and in his teenage years worked for a man named Vercetti. When James turned  he did something to Vercetti that ended up with James being run out of VC. He took what little he had left and hit the road in his Elegy with one town in mind Los Santos. James now  always looks over his shoulder and always sleeps with one eye open. He constantly changes his hair color and style. He changes the apartments he lives in. One month he lives in Vinewood Hills in a house with a pool next is a rats nest on Vespucci Blvd. He even changes the car he drives on a daily basis. Right now its a Blue Primo. He used to be wary of strangers and always kept an eye on everyone around him.

6517039,0,t1_czteif2,That was the intention of GTAV anyway. Rockstar wants to build the GTA world from here on out they had mentioned that way back before the game even hit last gen consoles. This drip feed of small updates is getting stale its naive to think that R isnt working on the next installment to their bread and butter.Edit If this was real and is coming for sure it would be paid DLC which would justify it being like a new game.

6758019,0,t3_48bndb,I think gta online is lacking in property sure theres loads of ten car apartments but when they all look the same whats the point? I think a house store should be added we could purchase new couches new appliances new technology and even new paintings. One thing that bugs me is how my Richards majestic apartment has a helipad at the top yet I have to drive to the other helipads on the map to get to it why cant I take the elevator up to the roof? Another thing that I believe should be added is the ability to replace the bland paintings in my apartment with my snapmatic photos I have many beautiful shots of the map I should be able to print out my work. Also why cant I have a radio and be able to switch between channels? Theres speakers all around the apartment but no music. One last thing that I believe should be added is games why cant I play a round of darts or go for an armwrestle in my home? I think adding table tennis pool or even beer pong would also be great.

6925776,0,t3_4akwa4,Yeah as soon as ScripthookV.NET as well and RagePluginHook are updated for this update someone will probably find the script responsible and kill it. The ONLY motivation I can see behind this move is greed or stupidity on Rockstars part. Especially the greed part what with how expensive the modifications are in GTAO. Either grind the money up OR cough up for a Shark Card or two. Sigh...UPDATE RagePluginHook added a new feature in the latest version RAGE Plugin Hook  Open Alpha  ... that counters the autodespawning of the new vehicles in Single Player. For those who dont want to use RagePluginHook theres also this mod which is an ASI mod using ScriptHookV that prevents them from being despawned.

This is laughably stupid because Rockstar does not handle the actual updating of your game  your platform does.

7873663,0,t1_d40yk80,Well I admit my own experience is anecdotal but speaking from personal experience Ive just never had any trouble making money and despite playing this game since  I didnt get into online until midlate .I played a lot of races which I was good at and enjoyed a lot and regularly made between k on races if I could find a decently full lobby which I didnt have difficulty finding.Then I also played a lot of missions semi enjoyed semi grinded them. And with the arrival of the Armored Kuruma I could now play them by myself and get a good amount of cash every hour.And then Heists came and that was a breath of fresh air because making money became much more easy. After doing all of them with my friends which paid very well with the first time bonus I then started joining random Heists not preps from the random invites that would come to my phone. With this I could make any where from k to about k each day. Plus since I got the game for PC the loading times and disconnections decreased tremendously.Yesterdays update is also a VERY GOOD way of making money. After buying the office and warehouses I made k since yesterday and if I take out my failed deliveries and cost to actually buy the goods I probably net profited around k. ,GrandTheftAutoV,d412m04,2,t5_2t0xk

Communicate with others in the lobby a lot of them are just like you and want to get their CEO work done without interruption.

Also if you look at the handling data the LWB is quite clear based on the normal Schafter.

When it hits C or so its going to be throttling for thermal protection significantly.  SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOUR COOLING!!! When you cleaned your coolers and stuff did you take the CPU cooler off your CPU? If you did did you clean off the old thermal paste and apply brand new paste? If you remove the cooler and dont apply new thermal paste youre going to have cooling issues. Air bubbles will form in the paste and dust and other contaminants can get in which will cause serious issues with cooling.

I know people with way more losses than victories seem to pay more at first  is the most Ive seen but that ratio goes to hell as soon as I place  on them. I also dont know how much the size of the bet itself affects that return. I generally put  down since k seems way less effective and most of the time it gives me k back which is too much risk for so little return. k give back close to that very frequently.Someone in  years must have figured this out.,GrandTheftAutoV,d7tlrth,2,t5_2t0xk

9268906,0,t1_d8qvtvr,Yeah I agree its redundant. But I mean how different could they make it? Theres only so many ways to deliversell drugs and they covered pretty much every way with the different delivery missions using bikes vans boats etc.So sure the delivery and supply runs feel like basically any other gta mission but thats pretty much what gta is all about. Drive somewhere shoot people either steal or sell something make a get away. Its not any more redundant than every other thing is my point. Add in the original things that this update adds like formation riding ability to manage a business that produces by itself the detail of the business interiors bike exclusive weapons and melee moves and Im able to overlook the redundant stuff. This is the best update yet in my opinion. But Im really into bikes and biker stuff so that might be biased ,GrandTheftAutoV,d8qwepn,1,t5_2t0xk

9296625,1,t1_d8udrt2,I suppose its wrong of me to blame specifically Shark Cards because its the Peer to Peer Networking that ultimately screws everything up Shark Cards are just the motivation behind Rockstars and Take Twos decisions.The game certainly does not suffer in regards to content at least not GTAO. GTA V singleplayer gets screwed in the name of Shark Card sales on a regular basis. Every time a DLC is released actually.Free DLC was a great decision by Rockstar because it adds more potential Shark Card buyers. Cheaters are bad because they remove potential Shark Card buyers Rockstar fights cheaters as they should because cheaters circumvent the need for money and also drive away legitimate players who could have been Shark Card buyers.Cheating is such a plague on the game because of Peer To Peer Networking and its insecurity. Rockstar changes things in the games core to fightthrow off the cheaters. This can and does lead to poorer optimization. The game ran perfectly fine when it finally came out on PC every patch since then has worsened its performance while simultaneously making it look worse. When the Bikers DLC patch came out my average FPS dropped by  with the same exact settings. Several months ago a patch was released and coincidentally my Distance Scaling slider has stopped working it is now a dummy setting permanently set to its lowest value and has remained that way ever since.So ultimately we end up with a game that runs worse and looks worse and at the same time singleplayer gets screwed even harder because you cant buy any of the new content added by DLCs except for the DLCs that came out on the older consoles and maybe a few others. My personal thought is that its this way to prevent players from trying before you buy and thus leading to less ingame sales and ultimately for some players less Shark Card sales.People try to fix some of their woes with GTAO long load times cheaters poor online optimization  all a symptom of the cancer that is Peer To Peer Networking by developing or playing multiplayer mods for GTA V that are separate and not connected to GTAO and then they get shut down by RockstarTake Two because that threatens Shark Card sales.I cannot be mad at a business for trying to make a profit I can be mad at a business for trying to make the same level of profit while reducing the quality of their product.I do play GTAO and I have fun in spite of all these issues because I play with my friends.I wait patiently for the fan boys who read half of the post and instantly downvote without offering an actual argument.,GrandTheftAutoV,d8uewlp,2,t5_2t0xk

Steam detected it all right away though and refunded me like half an hour after it happened. But then they banned my account and I had to go through a  month process of Steam support to get it back. They were asking for CD keys as proof of it being my account but the games in my library were from like  so I didnt even have them anymore. I forget how but I eventually got it back. Also while they refunded all the money Steam never got rid of the Dota stuff in my inventory and I was able to sell it in the Steam Marketplace for Steam money.

People who dont agree with sharkcard economy are upset that to play around it requires a significant timeinvestment specifically to entice people to spend money to save time. The game becomes a LOT less fun when you are spending it grinding your night away just to drive a pretty car while you play a video game. Having to make intelligent budget decisions and having to work for your enjoyment in a video game isnt why people buy Grand Theft Auto at least for the most part. Maybe you are a sociallyawkward SINK or maybe you are just a NEAT but not everyone has the time you have to sink into a single game and enjoys doing it. Some people have maybe  hours  nights a week to play games and at that rate it will take them weeks to get a fun car to play with.

He said how the autospoiler on the base model like the T gives you extra traction while its raised.I wonder if it does not give you added traction at all speeds like adding a fixed spoiler does on other cars at very lowstandstill speeds.

10368151,0,t1_dcjafb5,yes. Same with the Banshee R and the sultan RS.Those cars dont have changes to their spoiler traction and downforce modifier upon upgrading. This is a thing which happens with the cars released after the cunning stunts update in which they first used this whole downforce modifier concept. As a result the REB and the other cars got glitched because they forgot to remove the spoiler traction resulting in the suspension bumping against the floor at a high rate causing the car to go a lot faster.Not all new costum cars without their spoiler traction are slower though.

10456524,0,t1_dctbzhi,That approach is littered with bringing the same problems in from the current version though. GTA  is going to be a huge blockbuster even if they try to make it suck on purpose. They do not gain very much by allowing people to port over all of their assets. It also locks them into the present day time frame since they could not go backwards or very far forward in time and allow crossovers.If they do decide to continue online at all in the next game I think it will feature a character transfer at best with most or all of the income being lost or seized by the government. I do not know how much benzie helped keep GTA as what we all know and love but do know that postBenzie onlines success has brought a large change in what content has been made and what we can likely expect from content made in the future. ,GrandTheftAutoV,dctco6g,3,t5_2t0xk
