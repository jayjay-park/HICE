1634098,0,t1_cjkytb9,Its cool but is there any way you could make it harsher or more choppy or distorted or something? It reminds me of a tiedye for some reason which isnt really bad in itself but might not go with a noisey release. Thats just my initial reaction though what does anyone else think? ,noisecomps,cjl55rq,1,t5_2xypv

5282094,0,t1_cvlkgeh,I was thinking no hardware. When I say that Im referring to synthesizers and circuit bent things that would typically be used for noise on here. Hardware like an electric fan with little balls of paper inside would be allowed.,noisecomps,cvmuksq,2,t5_2xypv
5328743,0,t1_cvo5uw7,I emailed the store a while back and never got a response. Would you want to ask about it next time you stop in there?,noisecomps,cvst3q7,1,t5_2xypv
5860138,0,t1_cxnronw,Which one is the other split? It is essentially  bucks per person per release. It will cost between  and  bucks for the materials for each run of  tapes. So since they are splits well say  bucks per artist. And well just split the tapes down the middle as well if thats cool. So everyone would basically get their tapes at  per. ,noisecomps,cxnskt6,1,t5_2xypv
