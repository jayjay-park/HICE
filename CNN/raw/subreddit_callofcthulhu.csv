Neither had guns or any actual weapons. So they improvised as well. Critical success on a wrench throw from one. The other was compelled for  rounds. First round she thought the others skin was melting off their bones. nd round thought her own hands fell off.

You could go based off of Credit Rating and give them an allowance for starting gear or you could base it solely off of their occupation or you could just give them free reign and allow whatever they want and just have the limit be your own reason for the situation.

3491347,0,t3_3078yf,Being scared is not dependant on the game you play but on the mood and atmosphere you have in the game and how much the players buy into it. If everyone treats your CoC as a schlocktastic monster hunting game with insanity and high rates of character death no noone will be scared of CoC.What CoC does well is present strange entities with messed up ideas that can genuinely creep people out if played properly. Properly in this context means going and actually building on atmosphere and mood and getting the players to actually worry about their characters and the setting they interact with. So you obscure the opposition create horror and tension abuse the scarcity of resources and generally make the characters lives messed up while giving the players the atmosphere they crave. If you do this right there doesnt even have to be anything going bump in the night for the players to be scared witless.At the end of the day any game can be scary as long as you do it right. ,callofcthulhu,cpq8lk3,10,t5_2sdez

4222093,0,t3_397xfd,My group has been playing around with some house rules in ed. Weve found that whenever fights do come along unless youre VERY skilled at combat in some fashion then theres a whooooole lot of whiffing going on. Its annoying and drags out any fights that do end up happening. Kind of boring really. So one thing weve been trying out is that when youre in a situation where missing just seems really improbable a hit is guaranteed unless you fumble. If you fail the skill check then you do minimal damage. Example Youre standing right in front of someone. Youve got a bat. You lift it up and swing it at them. They fail theyre dodge check. So what? You just miss too? What happens when this occurs  times in a row? Everyone gets frustrated and doesnt enjoy the action. But if the blows being traded are chipping away the HP then it feels kind of slow but you know that if you can just last a little bit longer than them you might live... ,callofcthulhu,cs1hytf,1,t5_2sdez

4553250,0,t3_3devuk,I personally enjoy it for the aspect of horror. I love scary stories and Call of Cthulhu campaigns are generally just interactive scary stories. That combined with the fact that your character is usually very brittle allows for a style of game where each player is constantly on the edge of their seat in regards to whether death and insanity lurks right around the next corner.That and Lovecraftian lore is rad as fuck.,callofcthulhu,ct4k4pl,7,t5_2sdez

7783114,0,t1_d39jfo0,That may be true as gridbased combat is rarely needed.  You are right in this area.Personally Im a stickler for LOS ranged combat movement rules as it brings a layer of realism.  Yes it may bog the game somewhat but as the players get used to it it gets better.Per pg.  of the th Ed. its vague but suggests that it can workIf the keeper wishes each unit nominally stretches a yard to several yards depending on the situation.  If distance and rate becomes important in the game the keeper can provide specific measurements or better yet answer the question in game terms You can get there in one combat round.One unit equals  yd. to  yd.  I could suggest at least  yd. per hex.  So the Investigator could move one hex per  yd to cover ground.Movement need not be represented by tokens or figures on a table.  The keeper can set the scene and statements of intent can be general.  If no physical position is kept the keeper uses Luck rolls or some other semi random way to determine which investigator is near or far touching or untouched and so forth.This is suggesting that it doesnt have to be done but could.  I do like the imaginations that run wild among my players but at the same time Id like to convey where the players currently are at track their movements and be able to bring into light new creatures that the investigators may see.Sometimes I do feel rushed when the players are going up the stairs forget to check around and then automatically move up to the first or second door on the right on the second floor.  P  Perhaps there was something they forgot to check?  Ha and I do tend to not reveal those details.  P  Sometimes I sure am caled out as an evil GM for this.,callofcthulhu,d3qvimu,1,t5_2sdez

10706997,0,t3_5t06pu,Personally I dont represent the dream realm as being mechanically the same as the waking world.  I dont always handle it the same way but for example in the campaign Im running now the plan is for a character to voluntarily enter the dreamworld they have to recite a specifically mantralike chant.  At the point where they reach the end of it its like the flip of a switch they experience extreme vertigo and are in the dream which is a dark representation of prominent characters images and themes of the campaign represented in the dream not realistically so not like for example Stranger Things Upside Down where its just a dark cold misty alternate version of reality.  While theyre in the dream realm they cant speakor rather they are speaking but their mouth moves of its own accord reciting the chant that they used to get here backward and when it reaches the beginning they return to the waking world.  They cannot will themselves to speak anything else though with a successful power roll they can stop themselves from speaking to prolong their stay at the risk of losing some sanity the longer they stay the more checksfirst sanity check is D second is D third is D sanity and so on.  This makes them want to work quickly and creates a sense of urgency in the dream realm. Generally speaking when I create important NPCs or monsters I try to have some sensory trigger associated with them.  Perhaps an annoying laugh or the smell of manure or a golden tooth.  Then in the dream realm for whatever it is I want them to learn from the experience Ill create something that shares that sensory trigger combine it with something that the player doesnt necessarily know about the character.  So just as an example lets say that the landscaper Wilson has all of the three traits I mentioned above and is digging up corpses harvest body parts which he sells to the Big Bad but the player doesnt know this but by finding out and catching Wilson hell have a means of getting at the Big Bad.  In the dream realm the player would probably first smell the manure which would lead them to finding a jackal feeding on the corpse of somebody recently dead in the campaign.  The jackal would look up upon the players approach and grin a toothygrin with a momentary golden gleam from one of its fangs.  If the player seems clueless and decides to stick around the dreamscape longer Ill also have it do a kind of creepy animalistic approximation of Wilsons laugh before taking one of the arms and darting away with it under the fence of an enormous house thats looming over the entire environment.  In this way Im representing Wilson as a scavenger who is providing for himself by exploiting the deaths of others and that hes running to the sanctuary of someone who seems omnipresent and foreboding. Its a very silly example just cobbled together on the spot but its a pretty accurate representation of the process I use.  ,callofcthulhu,ddkci0a,3,t5_2sdez
