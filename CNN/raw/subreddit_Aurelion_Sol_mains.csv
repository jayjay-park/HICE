7025634,0,t1_d1cog3q,Ya thats what I suspected but it makes for better ganks and healthier clears since the stun is longer. In lane I think it might be best to take  points in W then maxing Q ,Aurelion_Sol_mains,d1cpini,1,t5_3cmo9
7038698,0,t3_4c0eyd,Hes actually really good in jungle  I think hell see more play out of the jungle than in midlane at least at the professional level. After a couple test Ive been leaning towards Runic EchoesgtRylaisgtLiandries into tank stats. Focus on getting massive Spirit Bomb Qs and act as an AP Tank of sorts think a Rumblelike play style if youve played him before.,Aurelion_Sol_mains,d1e6y9i,1,t5_3cmo9

8286681,0,t1_d5dd9pb,I disagree with your assessment but I can respect how you came to that conclusion.My biggest issue was that you implied that  game Aurelion players competing in the most competitive solodynamic queue experience in the world are using Stormraiders because theyre uncomfortable with the champ.

8925732,0,t3_52j0se,I personally go for midjung. In the jungle play champions like Mordekaiser Diana EkkoAP Hecarim and sometimes something else.

9089263,0,t1_d84dezc,Well the simple fact is you cant play him quite the same way early game as were used to. Youre gunna have to limit the usage of your W that means not using it to clear the waves early on and instead using your passive. Were also gunna be destroyed by virtually every matchup we face early now so thats also an issue that needs to be overcome. Overall the focus needs to be getting as much CS early on and waiting till you get  points in your W which at that point we can roam and get some kills. Its certainly not easy but its manageable.,Aurelion_Sol_mains,d84dsfn,2,t5_3cmo9

9227561,0,t3_56cm83,If you ask me besides any stat changes the real change Rylias needs is better classification for its slow. Aurelion Sols stars Azirs soldier attacks and even to be fair Cassiopeias twin fang abilities that dispite their coding are in all fairness realy hard DoTs. They should get the dimished return. A nerf to Rylias might make Aurelion Sol less dependant on it if it didnt offer so much to him. All Aurelion Sol cares about is the strong  perma slow. If it were nerfed maybe it could give players more choice. And if its to much of a nerf how about something in the lines of this to compensateNew W passive Hitting a star three times in a row on a champion deals a slight bit of bonus damage and grants Aurelion Sol a short movement speed boost.,Aurelion_Sol_mains,d8lnt37,1,t5_3cmo9

9312317,0,t1_d8vfxij,Aurelions winrate dropped because of worlds. Dude just check at what runessome of the items people run on him there. TF is the better champion on paper but I predict his gold card will get nerfed because he is strong just under the radarcheck out challenger soloq korean scene most midlaners spam him alongside Viktor exactly like with Aurelion .,Aurelion_Sol_mains,d8wekth,1,t5_3cmo9
9430679,0,t3_59pd0y,The cantcancelE bug happeneed to me at least  times in the week after they changed it although I cant remember it happening recently in the later patches. The  second cooldown for cancelling it though is still really annoying it should maximum be half a second or maybe even  second so that you dont immediately stop it on accident by double clicking.,Aurelion_Sol_mains,d9beiuf,2,t5_3cmo9
9505255,0,t1_d9k6beu,Rotating counterclockwise reduces the rate at which your stars will hit the enemy while rotating clockwise increases the rate at which they hit.

10118632,0,t3_5kt77s,I was really hyped for Aurelion but didnt think Id play him as much as I ended up playing. For the most part I was excited since he was a new cosmic character and one also made by Bards designer. I was looking for something new to play mid lane and  he popped up as this uniquely cool champion. At the time I was mostly playing Viktor and Azir so I figured Id use him every now and then.I remember listening to his VO which I do believe is the longest in the game and watching gameplay as I did for most new champions.I didnt get to buy him day  since I was on holiday at the time but I was lucky to come home after his price reduction so I could instabuy him. I dont remember a lot of flaming Ive been flamed a lot harder for picking BardIvern close to their releases even if Ivern was actually good with a few games under the belt and I had a lot of fun with him. He was a champion that enabled me to put my roamingmap skills to use and I never was a TF fan. Honestly I was shocked that not more people liked him but I found it understandable that theyd migrate towards flashier champions. I looked forward to seeing him in pro play and I remember waking up early to watch MSIs first game and having the nice surprise of seeing him. I remember doing well with him but eventually hit a plateau until I found the Corrupting Pot start. Aurelion was just broken.Presently Im happy with where hes landed in terms of general power. He does have a few difficult matchups now but his playstyle fits someone that has played support in the past but doesnt want anything to do with the likes of Karma. ,Aurelion_Sol_mains,dbqgrgl,2,t5_3cmo9

11332569,0,t3_61pr3t,Thats normal.When the Nexus explodes all champs get invulnerable like with a kayle ult but if you are in zhonyas or bard ult you wont get the effect. So after Zhonyas effect ends you are still vulnerable and sols stars just keep going forever anyway so sooner or later you will get the kill and it still counts.,Aurelion_Sol_mains,dfgizsq,7,t5_3cmo9
