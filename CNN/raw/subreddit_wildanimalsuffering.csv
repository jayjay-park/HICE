5906685,0,t3_3w6t18,I couldnt agree more!Im both bewildered and horrified when I think back on how I was only a year or two ago  I saw no issue at all with the lives of wild animals only concerning myself with the suffering of captive ones and even then I was way too permissive. I had a very romanticized and idealized view of nature  I didnt like seeing the lion catch the gazelle but I didnt concern myself with it too much because its only natural. By not thinking about the issue any further I allowed myself to maintain the illusion that wild animals live happily. I am glad to have a clearer and more ethical view now but it took no small amount of effort to get here and sadly most people around me dont seem to be willing to expand even half that amount of thought on a being that they cant relate to... it makes me worry about the future of the movement.I find it genuinely distressing that the happy nature and superior humans beliefs are so widespread especially in the education of children. I think a big part of the problem is that people are fed these lies all their lives and theyre such comforting ideas that getting rid of them can be very difficult. Theres so much distance put between humans and other animals sometimes even other humans that true empathy becomes almost impossible  they tend to see that gazelle as being a fundamentally different being from them when in truth it is remarkably similar. They say that any requests to imagine themselves in the place of the gazelle are unfair because theyre on a whole different level but scientifically this is simply false. Yes intelligence can be a factor since it allows for deeper emotional anguish. However this hasnt been completely proven to be worse than what a less intelligent being endures  in fact it could be argued that our intelligence at least allows us some control and comfort even in the direst of situations  if we get mauled by a lion we can at least hope that help will come or think of our loved ones. A gazelle most likely has no such chance. And what of mentally disabled humans? Surely no one would want them to be killed in such a brutal way and rightly so  even if some of them have about the same level of intelligence as a gazelle.,wildanimalsuffering,cxtwe6p,3,t5_3akri
