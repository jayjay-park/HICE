8637795,0,t1_d6km4te,I totally understand where you guys are coming from. I personally get grumpy when companies arent open and talkative too Currently looking at you Niantic and Hello Games.Unfortunately I cant use the Tofugu site to post news about EtoEto cause thats just not our thing. We really dont want it to be an ad machine for our other stuff. Its supposed to be for educating fun and interesting content about JapanJapanese. It feels kinda trashy to be like Hey we added a picture to EtoEto buy our stuff! every week or so.That being said umechakoichi had been posting teasers to fugu on his Twitter page Since hes the one in charge of Fugu for those updates following him there is probably your best bet. I dont even get to see his stuff until everyone else does if that helps. But I do pester him to post more things there.Kappa poor middle child is completely dependent on Fugu since it comes after so nothing will be going there until Fugu is complete. This is mostly because things are still being moved around and its possible something in Fugu might end up in Kappa and vice versa. Ive seen the giant chart Koichi has and its pretty intense. Theres going to be a TON of content when its all done. I tried to sneak a picture once but I dont think I have it anymore.And as I said before Kuma is pretty much done but well probably be adding content forever. We have hundreds of stories conversations and essays in our backlog and there will be at least one released every Monday for the rest of time or as long as Im alive and have a say in it. Hopefully well be able to do current eventsnews once the site is live too.Again I totally get that this is frustrating and crappy. Ive been trying to post art teasers to snapchat because its nice not to have our art floating around outside the site for long  so you can follow us there for that stuff tofuguhq. I used to do an update post here on reddit for Kuma too but everyone ignored it and just asked for Fugu over and over so I stopped because honestly I dont have an answer for that.There are only five of us working on the site. Koichi is working on FuguKappa I do Kuma Aya does literally every piece of art Mami manages all the audio and Viet is making the site from scratch. With us also working on Tofugu and Wanikani it makes for a lot of juggling. And even I feel guilty when I ask Koichi if he can please please give me something I can tell the people waiting.I guess what Im trying to say is that Im sorry we havent been more vocal. And were trying really hard but making a textbook from scratch is really tough. Like really tough you guys. And we certainly dont want to let people down or have them feel like were cheating them.TLDR Im were sorry. Weve been working hard and our updates dont seem to be reaching people because theyre in weird places like personal twitters and snapchat. So my proposition is thisDo you guys want me to make a tumblr and post a ton of updates and secret behind the scene things there? I wont be able to do TOO MUCH fugu stuff but Ill do a regular weekly one about the kuma episodes I add at least. And art previews etc. What do you guys think?,etoeto,d6lbze7,4,t5_331ai
