7812805,0,t1_d3tr3ke,Excellent points and some very valid issues I hadnt thought through. I really do like your sister sub idea. It was a concern how to keep the quality and content more or less uniform but if there were two or more linked subreddits coalescing in a finished work type main sub that might be a good solution. Ill have to ponder your points good stuff.The credentialed journalist bit was actually from over  years ago when I first created the subreddit. I was disgusted at all the great stories ignored by mainstream media. It was to the point where fellow redditors knew of important happenings in the world but family and friends who read the paper and watched CNN had no idea. I was hoping for the subreddit to become a resource that could hopefully find its way into mainstream media as a source of information. Weve seen it this election cycle reddit threads are actually being quoted on MSM. It might be less involved than Id originally thought of well have to see how it grows.Modwise itll be a bit difficult as I wouldnt put it past shady groups to try to become mods on a subreddit in a sleeper agent sort of way. Im thinking more of a stalking of various subreddits and seeking out users who have open minds thoughtful discussions and enough frequency of posting that we know theyre active users. Moderation is tiring Im lucky my other subs are basically selfregulating for the most part thanks to a few simple autodelete settings wed need folks willing to put at least a modicum of time into it. Good point on logging removed posts transparency is important though we dont want to have a modlog full of repeated garbage from spamming users. Fact issues will arise no doubt and opinions are certain to spring up. Im actually ok with that so long as it is not done in a bombastic manner and the underlying data is good. Spin wont be allowed but hypotheticals or personal opinions often lead to interesting debate and discussion... so long as it doesnt poison the well. I was thinking some form of citation beyond someones blog or an opinion piece might be required for posts. Make submitters do a little digging for the underlying data at which point if they post that then let them have a more opinionated disourse. What do you think of that idea?I appreciate your input the suggestions are good ones and once my insane work week is done Ill sit down and properly ruminate.,NewsCollaboration,d3u82e2,1,t5_2x0oi
