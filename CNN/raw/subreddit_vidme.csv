2681871,0,t3_2cpzgq,So I saw a video posted using vid.me and what immediately caught my eye about it is that I could open the video without leaving the page with RES just like I can with images.But when I have uploaded videos I have to link directly to the video in order for this feature to work. Also I cant get the thumbnail to work.Here is my post as you can see there is no thumbnail Here is another post of a video someone else uploaded and as you can the thumbnail works and it doesnt have to be linked directly to the video for it to work with RES.Is this because the second video is shorter? Thanks and I hope this was clear enough.,vidme,cn8n31y,1,t5_322sg

The redirect URI must be the one registered with your app. Scope is optional but you wont have access to much without it. Response type is optional and defaults to code. The scopes required to access particular methods are in our API docsToken response type will cause an access token to be returned in the URL hash and is suitable for javascriptonly apps. Code should be used by server apps and can be exchanged for an access token with the oauthtoken methodYou can use the authcreate method but that gives full access to the account so wed prefer you used OAuth. OAuth allows the user to see exactly what your app can do with their account.The videoupload scope grants access to video uploads. The videos scope allows full access to createeditdelete videos.,vidme,cnpax27,3,t5_322sg

10188566,0,t3_5lw09a,The site is still new and do you automatically follow someone the moment you see their channel? My advice is dont watch the follows too hard and just enjoy being a content creator anything worth it takes time. I usually dont followsub until I feel like I know the creator well enough and some people could be lurking until they see a good time to follow,vidme,dbyxi8q,1,t5_322sg

11711887,0,t1_dgm2ksj,Id rather filter channels than tags personally because Id like to browse a category and be able to remove people that are particularly prolific uploaders to see the smaller creators.  Im sure there are some gems that I just cant find because theyre obscured by a handful of people that have  videos each in recent.,vidme,dgnkll6,2,t5_322sg
