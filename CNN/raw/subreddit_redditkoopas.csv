2564301,0,t3_2owze2,I agree with the lower half attacking first then top half mopping up. I think that is what most clans do no? Also any strategy help either in chat or here prior to attacks would be welcomed.,redditkoopas,cmtaj4v,1,t5_35663
2585431,0,t3_2pdy4v,Could I get a second opinion on my attack idea? Im attacking  Clash Warrior.Ill send in two goblins from the south to run along the wall for  tiles and take out traps. Theyll die pretty much instantly but theyll set off any traps that are there. Two because there are only point attacks there so theyll take a minute to reload to get the second one.Then  or  giants to get sicced on the AD. This will clear out the CC and theyll be sitting just at that wall. Zap the CC troops with lightning hopefully damaging the AD in the process. Drop the CC which will contain a dragon next to the wizard on the bottom right.Healing spell on the giants while theyre taking fire and send in  wallbreakers to get to that caramel core where almost all the defenses are. I have lv wallbreakers for now so it takes  to break through gold walls.Once the AD is dead a healer on the giants.Wizards in each of the  corners to take out the one building placed far away and then theyll converge and do damage to the main base.From there... should I fill the rest of my barracks with balloons and send them in? Or should I drop barbs and archers and wizards for a ground attack?Or should I scrap it and find a new attack completely?,redditkoopas,cmw1xw8,1,t5_35663
