409764,0,t3_1yqogs,Ephys suggestions are slightly better but this doesnt really sound like much of a limitation since it covers nearly all the jutsu typesgtThe jutsu limited to this ability were academy techniques attacks barriers and low upkeep jutsu like eye techniquesAnd CC sounds rather high especially since very early mechanics discussions with CCCC regens were dismissed as spammy. It would also need to once again revamp the chakra exhaustion mechanic if a sort of limited CP regen is put into place. ,Konoha,cfn8lhd,1,t5_2waiq

696010,0,t3_224zg9,Ryo earnings and feat changes Feat changes have never been meant to be cheap or easy and were originally not even part of the system and only implemented when people requested to change them in exchange for high costs and with specific limitations. At the time they were implemented ryo was scarce with the player base earning Kmission so it has always been meant to be a steep price to pay for the convenience of changing them.PvP As I said before players need to clearly indicate to the OS via PM if they wish to keep their intentions secret or via post that they want to step in if certain conditions are met so that the OS knows to hold the thread and notify them. Edit  Costs of revivals changes etc. were also considered when changing the ryo earnings since the previous system of ryo rewards allowed for all these things to be obtained far more easily than originally intended.,Konoha,cgjdzrm,1,t5_2waiq
