5377213,0,t1_cvyxv5v,yeah i think they made a mistake by calling this Minecraft Story Mode because like you said it wasnt the story and I think lots of people thought this but I kind of like that it just fits anywhere in the world because this makes you think any number of these detailed stories could be going on anywhere in this world at any time and then it gives you a more personalized feel whenever you actually go back to your own regular Minecraft game. I think lots of people were surprised andor disappointed by the kiddie feeling of this one to but I feel like . it got better once you got out of Endercon and . If people have played telltales older stuff Sam and Max SBCGAP etc they can still make great games without going violent or dark and even though it wont be an extremely in depth violent story itll still be a nice entertaining thing that gives more meaning to the minecraft world,MinecraftStoryMode,cvz002a,4,t5_35his
