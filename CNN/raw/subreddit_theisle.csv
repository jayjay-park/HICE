10818594,0,t3_5uk5cp,There are playermade maps you may use. The Isles Discord has them and Im sure theres a The Isle guide that provides them. I recommend going to those areas for help. Once you get used to the map and coordinates the game should be much less frustrating. And yeah they made the game really hard to start as a new player for sure. This game is so new and unfinished though that I kind of dont blame them for not getting into the tutorial part of the game yet.,theisle,ddvv149,3,t5_366so
