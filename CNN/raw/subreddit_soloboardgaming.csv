977497,0,t3_25a2p7,I dont quite agree.  The game still retains the critical flaw of mythos cards after all players go  and while they try to balance this with card difficulty scaling to the number of investigators it does not address the issue of movement capabilities.In a solo investigator game I can move  spaces and thus random draws across the world mean many wasted turns getting to the location to deal with it.  With  investigators it means having the ability of having someone within  turn of a card to deal with it even if they are less than ideal.Compare this to similar Flying Frog games or Pandemic where you have player turn  villain turn instead.  It does not matter if I have   or  characters since each turn also contains a matching villain phase.However overall it is enjoyable.  I just find it is designed for  investigators and suffers at .  When playing solo I will use  investigators but it can be a lot to manage.  I prefer  player with my wife so I can control only  investigators and have someone helping me track the game.Oh yeah it is also one of my favorite games.,soloboardgaming,chfeep3,1,t5_31pu4
