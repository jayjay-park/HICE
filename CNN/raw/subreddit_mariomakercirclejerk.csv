7472502,0,t1_d2revkt,Ok so first off you saved it as a .jpg which has no transparency. It needs to be in .png format like the original for it to work. If you dont have any fancy image editing programs I recommend GIMP which is a sort of open source photoshop of sorts.I have a bit of time so Im gonna try doing it.EDIT So the spritesheet has been properly edited now I just have to wait for the new image to propagate to Reddits CDNs. Its uploaded in the config panel but hasnt hit the actual subreddit yet. Why does caching have to take forever...,mariomakercirclejerk,d2rkus5,1,t5_3a487
