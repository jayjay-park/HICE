206111,0,t3_1wh4e0,I didnt know that I could use Google maps to get biking directions when i first started bike commuting.  This is basically the route that typicalpdxer suggested.  You might want to give yourself a little extra time the first time you ride it.  Bike routes in Portland are pretty easy to use but it takes some getting used to at first.  ,CyclePDX,cf1x48p,2,t5_2s26i
207373,0,t1_cf1wmlz,Your idea seems the easiest and smoothest...though on nd between tillamook and Halsey the map indicates difficult connection is there anything god awful there? Its a small piece of my route but again Im a total beginner. Thanks again!,CyclePDX,cf22aac,1,t5_2s26i
281424,0,t3_1x03c0,Just signed up this is my first year.  I have some friends in Seattle who will be participating as well.  I see there are shuttles set up to take people and bikes back to Seattle after the event.  What is the best way to get to Seattle with my bike without having to drive my car?,CyclePDX,cf9xlda,2,t5_2s26i

1422015,0,t1_ciu4915,Great! If youre still there we can still get you set up with a sweet ride just not public on the site yet. its sort of like ordering off the menu at a really good restaurant ,CyclePDX,ciuizkm,1,t5_2s26i
1621714,0,t3_2cv3fl,Its tough I do my best to try and read where the drivers attention is. Usually its pretty easy to tell by where they are looking what their next move is. Whether their head is cocked back examining their rearview and side mirror or looking to their left to make sure no cars are coming before making the turn. Also if there is a bike lane and traffic is moving slow down to the speed of traffic and find a spot in between cars while moving through the intersection. If cars are stopped get in front of them so they see you. ,CyclePDX,cjjkzfz,1,t5_2s26i

2430339,0,t3_2nbe8b,Get ready for some hills. The trail along  is the best way to get to Portland. It ends at Canyon Drive then you can take that though Washington Park. ,CyclePDX,cmc3hza,8,t5_2s26i
2635707,0,t3_2q32p0,Here in Portland we can leave the bike lane any time we have to. Its a funny video but it doesnt apply here. Just look over your shoulder indicate and take the lane.,CyclePDX,cn2mc4b,1,t5_2s26i

3014126,0,t3_2uo2jy,Theres a slew of adapters and parts that most bike shops should have that will certainly let you add a rack to that bike. The coop on Alberta would be a good place to go. I hope youre at least  or  though thats a big ass bike.,CyclePDX,coaev0d,1,t5_2s26i
3078864,0,t1_cogopfx,I did the Urban but also wished there wouldve been an inbetween route. ish miles wouldve been perfect.  was too short with a lot of stopscross traffickids etc. Despite that it was a blast!Ill actually be back next weekend for Mini Bike Winter with a crew I ride with here in Seattle. More shenanigans to be had!,CyclePDX,coh4ed8,1,t5_2s26i

3581219,0,t1_cq0hbdu,Thanks!So I road the Novara randonee and Novara strada.  The Randonee had a steel frame lbs but it felt easier to ride around in vs the Strada lbs carbon fork disk brake.It might be the order I road the bikes in not sure yet.I need to ride more bikes but thats all REI kind of suggested for me.  I havent tried other bike shops yet because its raining and its downtown.,CyclePDX,cq0hk5j,1,t5_2s26i
3744147,0,t3_33afmx,If you want new. Your best best would be to buy a hybrid from one of the major bike manufactures. After a couple of years of commuting on a hybrid I found myself longing for a road bike. You could invest in a road bike initially but you get more value from your dollar in a hybrid at the entry level. You could also try River City Outlets ,CyclePDX,cqj236r,5,t5_2s26i
4202002,0,t3_38zr8q,I havent ridden that hill before but as far as a few decent climbs for conditioning in town SE Ankeny from thmansions and the little hills near Laurelhurst SE Salmon NW st near Burnside? I cant remember exactly but it was a huge mistake NW Macleay Blvd up to Calumet Terrace is a good workout as are the rest of the West Hills but this little strip was doable on my xOtherwise shifting before the hill into a light gear too easy and spinning before you need it is better than shifting when youre too far into a steep section riding with your hands relaxedon your bar ends and for me mentally breaking the route into race stages helps keep me going.Disclaimer Im either riding my BMX bike up those roads or a heavy chromoly singlespeed MTB around so my idea of a bigger hill is a little skewed.,CyclePDX,crz7xll,3,t5_2s26i
4524523,0,t1_csyuz0e,Last I remember Community Cycling Center had basic tools a pump and rudimentary stands behind the shop. Assuming business hours only wouldnt be surprised if they lent more specialized stuff as well.,CyclePDX,ct0ye5o,1,t5_2s26i
4532669,0,t1_ct1wv8c,Im  ... I think playing basketball got me to the point that I was able to do those training rides to begin with I cant imagine biking  miles if I hadnt been playing hoops.Also before I would bike on weekends leading up to the STP I was doing hoop fitness on Saturday mornings but that was mostly to get myself in better basketball shape which I dont feel did much for my overall endurance.EDIT Looking that amount of training it definitely doesnt look like much but for me more important than the training was eating appropriately and making the best of the rest stops.  I skipped the rest stop at around mile ish on day  which was a big mistake as I was feeling horribly broken going down the trail from mile  to the rest stop at mile .  I barely could keep my bike moving forward during that stretch.,CyclePDX,ct1z6nf,1,t5_2s26i
5143989,0,t3_3lb0o9,Having a good cycling rain jacket a set of rain pants and a waterproof cover for my helmet biking in the rain is fine.  I usually go at a slower pace to keep from overheating but its not unpleasant.,CyclePDX,cv61klc,1,t5_2s26i
6625330,0,t3_46d82c,I bought an ultralight Specialized jacket at River City Outlet for  a couple months back. Not a hardshell but keeps you warmer and drier for at least a commute. If they still have rain gear  could get you something more substantial.,CyclePDX,d04m6we,3,t5_2s26i

7890686,0,t3_4nc543,Its been like this every year Ive done it. Number one always has some insane numbers and number two is way off and much more reasonable. Tempted to start a profile next year and claim I do  miles every day all day. I mean why the duck not?Pisses me off on strava as well. Why bother to play at all if assholes are just going to leave the GPS on the bike while they drive around Portland? And reporting does nothing because its always you appear to be reporting an issue with an effort and no shit strava thats what Im doing but you wont let me. ,CyclePDX,d42zilz,6,t5_2s26i
