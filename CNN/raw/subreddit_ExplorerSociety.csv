Its a beautiful ship but also one of the most poorly defensible in the entire universe.Even cargo haulers have better guns and better options for installing additional ones.Now I know the purpose of the Carrack is for us to fly out to the edge of the known galaxy and sip contraband cognac by the light of an alien star but even so theres always going to be riff raff jealous of our fine humble pioneer ships.  A few extra bigger turrets or maybe a fancy point defense system would not at all go astray.,ExplorerSociety,cxgjtd9,4,t5_3b1x6

It implies that there is a best ship for exploring and that that ship is the Carrack. Alternatively this one isnt bad either  however Im not a huge fan of the white on black and prefer the color of the one chosen. Probably my favorite overall is this one  although it runs into the same issue I had previously mentioned about just the Carrack being represented. ,ExplorerSociety,cxjzotw,1,t5_3b1x6

First of all a discussion takes place in an atmosphere where ALL ideas are put forward and considered not just the ones that you agree with and if you dont like them say so just as Juggernautsc  suggests dont be forced into being quiet because you want to be popular or try to force others to not comment your very idea no matter how bad it may appear to you may be the one to finally bring consensus to the discussion and resolve the final draft of the idea.,ExplorerSociety,cxpozw8,1,t5_3b1x6
