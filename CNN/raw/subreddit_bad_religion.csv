Secondly if you come from a decently conservativefundamentalist background youll have learned extensively about all the wrongs of the people who view the religion differently and how liberal interpretations of your religion will bring about the end of times Im not even kidding this is what my grandmy told me recently.As you might have guessed I also come from a strongly conservative background and Ill admit that the ratheism viewpoint is really attractive.

1715920,0,t3_2e1g8z,Dunno about bad religion but its certainly bad linguistics.gtThe translation committees of all Bibles over the last  years! sic didnt travel in time and have a breakfast video conference at which they decided Lets make Christ a sinner in Mark by ignoring the antecedent of met orges should be their anger not His sheesh. But at least all the English translations since  make Him into a sinner in that verse!Not really.  I see what the author is getting at but the problem is this only works if you decide what you want the verse to mean and then work backwards.The Greek text in question from the Society for Biblical Literatures Greek New Testamentgt                        . The words hes talking about are in bold.  So its vaguely plausible only because theres no specific possessive marker for  anger.  The problem is that the preposition before it  when followed by a word in the genitive case which  is means with and some other similar ideasSo the verse begins and he looked at them with anger....  It really doesnt make sense for this construction to be used to refer to the anger of them the Pharisees in the synagogue.  Theres nothing in the context to suggest that theyre angry they are hoping Jesus will slip up by healing on the Sabbath but thats not consistent with them being angry.The New Revised Standard Version translates this passage asgtAgain he entered the synagogue and a man was there who had a withered hand. They watched him to see whether he would cure him on the sabbath so that they might accuse him. And he said to the man who had the withered hand Come forward. Then he said to them Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath to save life or to kill? But they were silent. He looked around at them with anger he was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man Stretch out your hand. He stretched it out and his hand was restored. The Pharisees went out and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him how to destroy him.Verse  is the Greek I have above but context is everything in translation.  The King James version interprets this passage the same way.But of course our author somehow has secret knowledge of Greek that as he readily points out no other translation committee has had.  That they all made the same mistake just means theyre all equally fallible not that our person is wrong.From a bad religion standpoint theres nothing in Christian doctrine that Im aware of that equates anger with sin wrath? especially when attributed to the divine.  God and Jesus get angry all the time so I dont at all see the problem from a theological point of view.,bad_religion,cjvgcr1,0,t5_2yu3u

2936346,0,t1_co1vie1,Continued from aboveFurther the other archallegorist Origen accuses Jews as a whole of overly literal interpretation of the Law the reason why we do not live like the Jews is that we think the literal interpretation of the laws does not contain the meaning of the legislation Contra Celsum .. Also interesting in light of what Ive said about Marcion is that in De Princ .. Origen mentions this sort of naive Jewish literalism in conjunction with Marcionism.Suffice it to say however Origen followed Pauls supersessionism completely that at least the literal sense of the Law had been abolished... and in fact the former suggests that really all the doctrines of the Jews living now are myths and trashfutility   Yet again the nonhuman and absolute eternal nature of the Law is ubiquitous in Jewish tradition. In Mishnah Sanhedrin . denial of the heavenly origin of Torah is enough to disqualify one from salvation  afterlife rewardgtthese are the ones who have no portion in the worldtocome  He who says the resurrection of the dead is a teaching that does not derive from the Torah  and the Torah does not come from Heaven...The Talmud goes even further heregtBecause he has despised the word of the Lord and broken his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off Num.  This refers to one who says The Torah does not come from heaven. And even if he had said The entire Torah comes from heaven except for this one verse which the Holy One blessed be he did not say but which Moses said on his own such a one falls under the verse The th and th of Maimonides principles of faith certainly affirm the extremely exalted position of the Law  which needless to say have been among the most authoritative principles for Conservative and Orthodox Judaism. Also if theres any doubt as to the ubiquity of these traditions from the azal on to the Rishonim I recommend Heschels monograph Heavenly Torah As Refracted through the Generations.Yes Reform Judaism is a different beast... though for the most part a thoroughly modern one. As you seem to realize in your quotatiob of the th century ! Columbus Platform.Where does Jesus fit into this then? I think theres a bifurcation in the gospel traditions ultimately due to snippets of archaic sources embedded within where there are slight vestiges of the highly conservative Torahaffirmingexpanding Jesus but then also the supersessionist Jesus probably already found in Mark  and .But just as Zimri and Korah may be the archheretics for Josephus re the Law Jesus along with Christians in general is targeted as an egregious heretic in rabbinic texts.This whole line of discussion seems to have stemmed more or less solely from your comment these laws are not divinely ordained by God in the ordinary sense. I challenged this as an extremely idiosyncratic view that only really made its appearance in Jewish tradition due to early Christian antinomianism and shortly thereafter Christian made its heretical break from Judaism altogether. Every single fact out there is on my side and the fact that you took your arguments in the direction you did is absolutely astounding re that the minority status of the Law was at all retained anytime after the th c.

It was ended by Diocletian who dropped the pretense of the Emperor being the First Man of The Republic and started wearing a crown making his subjects kowtow to him etc. and marginalized the Senate for good.Economically the empire never recovered back to the level it was in the AD s and the western part of the Empire was hit especially hard. And even after order was restored by Diocletian the rate of civil wars and coups remained much higher than in the early empire and that would eventually doom the Western Empire because various claimants for the crown cared more about killing the other claimants than keeping the Germans out.Culturally it was a huge turning point.

A lot of Ratheists IMO dont understand faith exactly because they were raised in a Protestant cultural background where the deep emotional mystical spirituality behind such faith is ignored.,bad_religion,cujfnes,2,t5_2yu3u

For instance the thing about the moon god what the fuck?! thats so made up its not funny. They got the star and moon from the Ottoman Empire that dissolved in  not some magical fucking moon god.

6900055,0,t3_4a6775,Id encourage you to read the works of Peter Berger Grace Davies Linda Woodhead Jrgen Habermas and Talal Assad on secularism and religion. Quick and brutal summary of each...Peter Berger  used to argue that secularism was universal process retracted this belief and now considers secularism to a more momentary social phenomenon that is itself disappearing.Grace Davie  looked at how secularism and demise of religion is a very European thing which is a trend that is being increasingly reversed. Looked at different forms of religiosity beyond organised religion.Linda Woodhead  there are old types of religion and new types of religion in Europe. New types typified by personal choice looser communal identities. Old types still present and in some places growing.Jrgen Habermas  proponent of postsecularism as term to describe new social relationships including a loss of confidence in secularism and values of modernity. Talal Assad  Protestant Reformation in Europe created a particular privatised form of religion. Europe has increasingly redefined religion to be private personal and about belief such that it increasingly occupied a less meaningful and less powerful role in society. I think to give a truly meaningful reason for the decline of religion I would want to zoom in to a particular example. So why is the Anglican Church in UK losing Sunday worshippers? Which I believe would for different reasons than why are less people entering Catholic priesthood?. Im inclined to thing lots of little particular reasons create trends like declining religion in Europe in twentieth century such that I dont think its possible to answer a question about religious decline with only a few answers. Which is itself a useful answer I hope.,bad_religion,d0yfudr,11,t5_2yu3u
6915128,0,t1_d0zvu2d,There is just a teeny bit of badreligion in this comment here. Some misunderstandings of theology.gt The rest is all just a spiritual purpose which is not observable saying we have a soul is similar to the sun praying to God. Ehh not quite. Close though. Yes the Sun prostrates but so do trees planst stars see  prostrating is not bowing.gtAnd the star and the trees prostrate themselves.gtSimilarly even Muslim theologians did not take some of these things as the absolute truth but rather saw a metaphoric and spiritual meaning behind the scripture.Not necessarily they often just consigned the meaning.gtVery few Muslims actually take science from the Quran and base their teachings on it the Quran is used as a spiritual guide rather than a basis for science.Correct. However many things are indeed taken literally eg. Adam and Eve are indeed real people who did not have human parents they were created miraculously although no time frame for when any of these events took place is given.But you are missing the point entirely.The reason for these statements not being literal and thus anthropomorphic god is a man ect  has nothing to do with oh but spirituality or oh but metaphor. No theologian does this.It is based on two Quranic maximsThere is nothing like unto Him  and basicaly restated in other places.AndgtIt is He who has sent down to you O Muhammad the Book in it are verses that are precise  they are the foundation of the Book  and others unspecific. As for those in whose hearts is deviation from truth they will follow that of it which is unspecific seeking discord and seeking an interpretation suitable to them. And no one knows its true interpretation except Allah . But those firm in knowledge say We believe in it. All of it is from our Lord. And no one will be reminded except those of understanding. God is the creator of everything including time and space thus he transcends time and space. He cannot be a body of any kind nothing like unto him and logical contradiction with transcending time and space. This is a simple logical consequence.So using these principles when we get verses like established over the throne you can follow Quran  and consign the meaning tafweedgtWe believe that the Merciful established Himself over the Throne  and we do not know the reality of the meaning of this nor what is meant by it l nalamu haqqata mina dhlika wa almurda bihi while we do believe that There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him  and that He is exalted far above the most elevated of created things. That is the way of the Salaf or at least their vast majority and it is the safest because one is not required to probe into such matters.  AlNawawi.Other scholars felt the need to go past consigning and elaborated on figurative interpretations such as  His establishment istiw over the Throne is a metaphor for establishing dominion istl over His kingdom.But fundamentally none of this is about being spiritual.Its about negating certain meanings as impossible based on the rest of the text eg. Nothing like unto him.,bad_religion,d105hyh,14,t5_2yu3u
