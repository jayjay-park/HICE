22040,0,t3_1ubuvo, His views or at least his style of advocating probably did contribute to him being cut. I dont like that at all but I doubt it is the entire reason as he tries to claim. He draws a parallel to Longwell being cut which I think is strange as basically everyone agrees picking up Walsh was the right choice. He claims that people cant read because he never actually called anyone a lustful cockmonster. That doesnt change the fact that people can still object to the tone of his writing. Also his condescension is not appreciated. Getting in trouble with the law will get players released. Ask A.J. Jefferson. The team has to be invested in you to bother sticking with you. Kluwe doesnt want to ruin Priefers career but doesnt think he should coach again. Pick one or the other Chris.

33045,0,t1_cei3mf3,Patterson was actually worth a rd th and th. We spent those to move up from our nd round pick to th overall. We would have to give up much more for st or nd overall. Something like what the Redskins did or more. I would only trade up for Bridgewater. If the Texans dont take him wed probably have to trade up to nd overall and give up a first this year and next year plus a lot of picks this year. I think its better not to trade up and lose all those picks though. We need a lot of help on defense. If we do it I wont call us stupid. Its just something I wouldnt risk. I mean we really do need a QB. Wed just be giving up a lot of picks this year and next year to do it which would really hurt us for the long run unless that QB actually works out and sticks around and does well for  years. I think the better option is to begin to rebuild our defense this year and draft a QB that could maybe develop into the future. Then if we think said QB will develop build around him. Otherwise try to trade up the next year. Itd be much more worth it to trade up if we had a good team for that QB to come into. Next years QB prospects will be just as good as this years I think.,minnesotavikings,cei6zc3,3,t5_2qocl

502562,0,t1_cfv0bbw,I did specify that when was the last time a QB didnt get an invite and had success? Tony Romo was the first thought but he got a combine invite. Brett Smith is just another example in a very very long line of draft gems at the quarterback position. Because he does a few things well at the college level and has such low expectations having never been considered a top QB before people started looking for draft gems people get excited. That quote is not correct. EVERYONE  is less manic than Manziel and Manziels mania is what makes him look good.I didnt extensively look at him but Im looking again now on draft breakdowns vids of this year. Im  minutes into the New Mexico video and I havent had to see him think once. Its all spread offense first reads and designed runs. actually Im wrong at  seconds he comes off his first read thats triple covered and goes to the checkdown. What I dont like about him is that hes so typical college quarterback that it hurts. Plays in a spread pretty much all first reads good athlete so he can run. Isnt asked to hit receivers in routes. Slants outs throwing guys open that sort of thing. Thats not his game. His game is what so many other functional college QBs do. Throw to first read throw to short curl route after the guy has been standing there for  seconds. Throw screen. Oh fuck my first read was taken away time to run around a little and hope I see someone wide the fuck open so that I can throw it to them. I dont want to see someone have their first read taken away roll out for  seconds and then hit a guy who got wide open because the secondary didnt do their job in staying with him. I want to see someone have their first read taken away and they just stand in the pocket and hit the next one taking one second. Thatll work on a consistent basis thatll work in the NFL.Brett Smith has average stats in an average conference a good but not great arm and good but not great .. speed. Im going to make a new rule now.

966616,0,t3_256fvy,So I would have preferred a different pick but I can see the value. First off he was seen as a second rounder by a lot of people second off his stock would have gone up had he finished school. Hes a big samoan boy who had a faster  yard shuttle than Clowney...thats right. We got a guy in the third.Hes got a very good first step and good tackling technique. His biggest weakness is a genuine lack of rushing technique. He stands up and doesnt have the moves to rush the passer. Gets obliterated by doubles teams no ability to split defenders. I can see him as an end only he will not rotate to tech for any games or I will eat my shorts.That having been said he is not on the level of someone like Girffen. They are both  and  but Giffen benched  reps and was faster in the . Crichton only put up  reps and was slower in the . So the top end of him is not as high but he should be a solid rotation player if he develops technique. ,minnesotavikings,che5wn2,18,t5_2qocl

1103010,0,t3_26qwm8,I defend him when people make brazen accusations void of any facts at all against him. Example He has a weak arm. His arm is adequately strong. Anyone who says Ponder has a weak arm only watched that one hail mary against Dallas last year and no other throw hes ever made and theyll only ever reference this. Ponder has thrown the ball farther than that multiple times during his career. Notably a few times to Wright and I think a couple of times to Harvin in . Thats not even what his problem is with his arm strength. The problem is driving the ball with zip into tight windows. He hardly ever did this before last season. He had the arm to do it he just wasnt really confident enough it seemed to put zip on the ball like he was scared he wouldnt be able to control it. Last year he actually started to throw the ball harder more often. I recall being very impressed with some of the zipped passes in the first game of the season vs. the Lions. He zipped the ball over the middle quite a few times. So it wasnt his arm strength it was his confidence in his control.I hate it when people say he has a weak arm. ,minnesotavikings,chto2sh,3,t5_2qocl

While in Indy they got giftwrapped Andrew Luck and since then their GM has drafted  worthwhile players and traded a first round pick for trent richardson.

So people will get cold feet people will only see what they already think he has a bad deep ball lacks arm strength not a personality and dont wanna bet their jobs on a guy like that.

1257139,0,t1_ciauvxk,There are quite a few OCs that dont allow their QB to audible out. The idea of packaged plays is gaining traction though for sure. The old school ideology is that there is a gameplan that could be destroyed by changing plays. For example you want to show defenses a certain thing over and over to get them to adapt to it and then surprise them with a similar play that is actually vastly different. Personally I am not a fan of that line of thinking but I really enjoy CKs Philly offense and the packaged plays that they run. I dont think Norv will do things that way but he will allow audibles for sure. The other thing about the AC system though is although it allows for audibles they dont get called as often just because that way there are fewer mistakes etc. ,minnesotavikings,cib1k96,1,t5_2qocl

Longer and skinnier compared to my first shortfat one even though the same size. The white in the sleeve stripes has some red in it was almost pink. The second one was more gold on the sleeves than the first which was bright yellow. And the little nike tag at the bottom was a big thick rubbery tag like the nfl one at the collar. The second was a sewed on piece of fabric. So I guess its a gamble.

And the legislative process to define those degrees.  The NFL just hasnt defined any degrees for things such as these.  So we have to fall back on the legal system.  And that takes time.

Just a penalty.Bullying taunting thugging it up on the field to hurt someone? Just a penalty.The NFL needs to drop the charade and say hey this is gladiators. We dont care about the players we dont care what the players do off the field we dont stand for anything but money. We tolerate violent players on and off the field we hide the evidence when one of them beats a womanuntil the film leaks and then we pretend to be shocked. Grown man beating on a  year old child with an object until the kid is bleeding  and already scarred for life AP says he was such a brave little man because he didnt cry.

1930759,0,t3_2grfsk,Look if you just want to see people punished then you are wanting him to never play again.  If you want to see the world become a better place you want to see people with problems get punished justice deter others all that jazz.  But you also want to give those folks a chance at redemption.  To become better people and inspire others to change their own ways.  I think at this point Peterson should only miss  games as required by the CBA if he is convicted.  But unfortunately the prosecution illegally released their entire case early so the NFL has no choice but to suspend him until the proceedings are done.  So now Peterson can lose  games if he fights the case and wins.  Or he can lose potentially less games and play this season if he pleads guilty to a lesser charge and is put on diversion or probation.  So in a really odd way this preemptive indefinite suspension with pay means that Peterson may see the punishment for pleading guilty as less than the punishment for fighting the case and winning.And for those folks that think he has no chance to win the case keep in mind that there really is no clear definition of the line between discipline and abuse.  Keep in mind that some of the prosecutions evidence may not be admissible due to their illegal disclosure to TMZ prior to indictment.  ,minnesotavikings,cklubye,16,t5_2qocl

Maybe we were just more focused on coverage Barr seemed to drop back into coverage almost every play for example but even on blitzes our pass rush was practically nonexistent.

I also predict a clean hit on the QB that will draw a flag. These flags will also be on rd downs and on their side of the field ultimately extending their drives and killing our moral.

All Im saying is that Ponder could turn into a better QB with a competent coaching staff. Plus he is only . Why not let an actual good coaching staff try and mold a quality backup out of a smart and athletic QB who just needs to learn to read defenses better and make quicker decisions and not the exactly what you see play with Cassel. Dont get me wrong I was ecstatic when they resigned Cassel but with Teddys time here let the young gun get a shot. I know what youre thinking But he had  years to prove he was the man but our coaching staff did suck majorly remember and it was surviving off the play of a very gifted Running Back. If Ponder doesnt improve noticeably to the coaching staff by the end of the season well then San Fran is defs in the market for anyone halfway decent at this position.

2276988,0,t1_clsyjsj,It doesnt make sense at all.  Just because him sitting out wasnt technically punishment doesnt mean that isnt what it was.  He missed half of the season as a result of this and it wasnt time he spent in jail.  Thats a punishment.  Just because the NFL chose to call it something else doesnt invalidate the time he missed.  Its reasonable to say he served his time on the exempt list and so he doesnt need to be suspended further.  The only reason you think he should miss more time is because you think what he did is morally objectionable and you feel like he needs to be punished more thoroughly.  But that doesnt make it reasonable or fair compared to the rest of what goes on in the NFL.    ,minnesotavikings,clt5kat,1,t5_2qocl

2317694,0,t1_cly1mlj,I clarified by indirectly. I think a poorly managed franchise would lead to losing which would definitely hurt ticket sales. We used to be under threat of blackout because people werent buying tickets. We had to get Target or some other corporation to buy the rest of the tickets in order to avoid the blackout. Target buying the remaining tickets isnt really selling out. This is as recent as .A poorly managed franchise leads to losing which usually means free agents dont want to sign. Most players want to go to winning teams. They want money but they also want to win.Corporate sponsorship is a tell in how well the franchise is being managed. Do corporations want to associate with us? Do they not? IF no corporation wants their name next to ours thats bad for the franchise. The owners would probably sell and the new guys would try to do something new and turnover everything. I just dont want us to have any of the tells of a bad or mismanaged franchise. I dont want to see losing. I dont want to see Vikings trying to avoid blackout headlines. I dont want to see a lot of turnover in management the front office or coaching. Thats what I think you get if you mismanage a situation like this. Negative public opinion can really hurt a franchise. I dont mean to fear monger and I didnt mean to say that this specific Adrian Peterson situation would result in the team moving. Im just saying that when you mismanage a situation like this it could really hurt a franchise. And if you get turnover in ownership that could mean a change in location. The stadium pretty much ensures that we wouldnt move for a long time but ownership could still be stupid and do it anyway. I mean look what happened to the North Stars.,minnesotavikings,cly6jvo,1,t5_2qocl

Hes done some great things for us but no matter what were gonna add a RB to share carries with whether through the Draft Free Agency or trades. McKinnon is good and has a bright future with us but hes not the type if back that can the whole workload he needs another guy to help him out and although Asiata has done some nice things he isnt the answer. Maybe Tate or Blount arnt the answers either but neither would cost a lot to get so why not bring one in for the rest if the season as a practice run.

I appreciate the work you put forth in the comment in a completely nonsarcastic way I mean it but I do hash this out a bit. The point that Teddys passer rating and YPA are higher is driven in part by the stark differences passing between  and .For a first year player in  nonrookie it was actually a pretty good year.

2697919,0,t3_2qyawd,gtMy main question is what are the Vikings thinking of doing with AP? It might sound like a stupid decision but Ive given it some thought. Jerrick Mckinnon has looked really good and I think getting AP off the roster would open them up to a lot of opportunities money wise. Am I completely wrong here? Just a thought.At this point I think enough sources have confirmed that the Vikings organization would have him back if he wants to come back so I think that its pretty much up to him at this point. Id put his return to MN right now at about  probably but thats just my opinion. Paul Allen says hes about  sure and he talks to a lot of people from the Vikings. gtIve heard some talks about the Vikings trying to get someone in Free Agency. I believe Dez Bryant is a big target. What are some Free Agents the Vikings are trying for and is it realistic they will sign?The Cowboys are definitely keeping Dez. Theyd drop Murray before Dez if it got to that point. gtWho are the top young prospects on the team? What players are the most coveted in your opinion and what does their future look like?Obviously we are all going nuts over Teddy so you can read about that in the hundreds of other posts that analyze him better than I can. Other than Teddy McKinnon looked pretty good before he got injured so well see where that goes. I have a lovehate relationship with Asiata. He gets TDs and shows flashes of a real bruiser type RB but most of the time he gets stopped at the line and hes pretty slow.  Harrison Smith FS is pretty awesome and young. Easily put him at top  safety in the league. Blanton our other safety needs work if were going to continue using him but he might need some work. Xavier Rhodes CB is doing awesome stuff. The second half of this season he has been playing like a top ten corner and hell continue to develop under Zimmer.  Everson Griffen DE has done some good things and has a really fungoofy personality. We just gave him a huge longterm contract that was criticized early on but it looks like it was the right decision.  Cordarelle Patterson WR was supposed to be awesome this year with how he played last season but hes been a disappointment. Hes not improved his route running or jump ball and hes dropped a few catchable passes. That said hell be going into his third year next year and Jennings says hes going to focus a lot on mentoring him over the offseason so everyones hoping hell get better. Charles Johnson WR is the classic offthepractice squad story. We picked him up from the Browns practice squad around week  and when Patterson was benched due to poor performance Johnson kind of came out of nowhere and became Teddys favorite target. He runs really good routes so hes open a ton. Still hard to say if hes our WR of the future but its a possibility. Maybe hell be able to replace Jennings in the slot when he inevitably retires in a couple of years.  Matt Kalil LT was frustrating earlier in the season with his atrocious. Hes been OK for the remainder though and he had a really good rookie year so its possible hell bounce back. We know really badly need to replace our LG Charlie Johnson not to be confused with Charles Johnson WR so were hoping once we do that itll help out Kalil as well or worstcase we flipflop them and make the new guy the tackle.  Anthony Barr SLB was drafted high in the first round this year. Had a great year including a forced fumble recovery and TD to win in OT earlier. Unfortunately this season was cut short for him due to injury but well be excited to see him back next year. Jarius Wright WR. Young guy was Teddys favored target earlier in the season. Shown some flashes including a yard TD catchandrun on a screen but overall kinda meh. Could possibly get better with another offseason though.  Blair Walsh K. Apart from a couple shaky games in a row this season Walsh is very solid. Can rely on him to get  yarders through the uprights most of the time and lt yarders are usually close to automatic. Old guys you may or may not remember Greenway WLB. Probably retiring soon and his play has diminished due to age but hes still loved for his long tenure and community service projects. Brian Robison DE. Gotten a few sacks and still awesome but well have to think about replacing him soon. John Sullivan C. Hes awesome goes on local sports media a lot and just seems like a cool dude and hes very smart. He helps out reading the defense on the line and has been awesome helping Teddy develop. Im probably forgetting a few people. ,minnesotavikings,cnaqj6d,3,t5_2qocl

If we go offense first round it has go be Guard. Go receiver in the second round if you have to but I can think of three or four other positions we need more in the first round. Especially if your head coach preaches defense. Look at the offense Wilson is winning with. We have more talent than the Seahawks on offense outside of their superior line. I believe a young stud at LG would greatly reduce pressure for Teddy but also Kalil and Sullivan. ,minnesotavikings,cncpb0g,2,t5_2qocl

I think hes actually kinda close to his ceiling physically but Zimmer will probably use him even better and hell read offenses better. He was playing around with Harrys positioning a lot this season and seeing what he excelled at. I think next year Zimll have Harry move around a lot still but more focused on his strengths. I actually want us to give him something like a yrmil contract if possible.

As far as best throw Id definitely put it in the conversation with the  should have been TD passes along the sideline against the phins.

Hell we might even have a chance at Fitz if they dont restructure in AZ. Not that he would be a long term option but he would be an excellent  year bandaid and an additional mentor for Flash and Johnson. WR is the sexy pick to be sure and I would love to reunite Parker and Teddy. But I would rather solidify the line first. Scherff solves a huge problem at LG and if Kalil doesnt pull his head out of his ass then Scherff can slide over to LT and solve that problem as well. That is too good of an option to pass up...

Otherwise I think the rest of our line is fine if healthy. Sullivan is a top center Fusco was playing amazing before he went down and Loadholdt is a slightly aboveaverage right guard who can run block extremely well.. MLBBrinkley is downright bad and MLB is probably our most glaring need on defense.. WR Good WRs can be found later in the draft and hopefully someone with good measurables can be found in the rd..

The guy consistently doublecatches passes and is not much better with his routes than Patterson. Patterson can run routes just not as well as an elite receiver.  The question about his playbook knowledge may be that he is simply slower to absorb the information as others. That doesnt mean he cant do it just that he is behind others.

Not as many qualities starters or depth there I think the reason for that is the samemore talented players tend to be put in positions to be a tackle or CB so Im not sure its easy to fill them in in FA. The weird thing about guard is that the distribution of talent in the draft for them is relatively flat so if you pick a late one every year youre bound to keep hitting which is what the Vikings do hits Sullivan Fusco. Lots of misses but its the thth round. There are some options in FA this year though some require gambling Jah Reid or position conversion technically Wisniewski but more Barskdale.I agree with linebackers however.

Norv will help evaluate receivers. Reiterated how good talent can be found late in the draft Thinks the skill players are having a solid offseason after buying into what the team was doing in the second half of this year. Likes Jarius in the slot. Points out that he already got a lot of work there with Jennings on the outside. Also mentions Theilen and says there are lots of options there. Thinks Theilen improved a lot last year as much as any player we had. Got a chance to go in vs Chicago and made some big plays.

I have listened for years and lately I have to constantly change the station or walk away. I harbor no personal ill will towards the hosts but most of them love playing general managers capologists and to speak for the real fans when they dont pay their hard earned money to watch the games. And the AP thing has taken their stupidity to another level. No I dont agree with him overdisciplining his child but when did proper parenting begin and end with whether you corporeally punish your child. I know parents who verbally abuse their children and a lot of them neglect personal time with them as well. I guess that doesnt adversely affect children. AP has no responsibility to placate KFAN hosts just his family the judicial system the NFL hierarchy and the paying customers.

I honestly dont know why hes being touted as the top corner in the class..he was in the media spotlight after the combine and mayock hashad him as his no corner so I have a feeling a lot of people here on reddit that havent watched the other corners just parrot that..Ive heard it quite often from people who admit they dont know much about the prospects. Im just not sold on waynes..especially at . Hell nah. Hes got tight hips..not a huge fan of his footwork..you can just tell hes going to struggle against average nfl receivers if theyre decently fast. He isnt going to get away with all the grabbing he threw around in college. Peters would be the consensus  corner if it werent for the issues he had with the new coach that came in while he was in college.Ive said it multiple times but after listening to his interviews I trust what he said..how he explained everything. I highly highly doubt hes going to bring any of that into the nfl. He fully understands how he acted wasnt right took full responsibility and matured from that experience.Ill predict right now that peters will have a much much better nfl career than waynes. Hell I dont even think waynes will end up being the second best corner in this class tbh. The media has over inflated the hype and itll show this year.Peters will be better in the nfl imo.  I need to watch a few of the other top prospects on draft breakdown when I have time.  Its easy to get hyped on waynes if all youre doing is watching highlights and watching post combine media but you can make a great highlight video from pretty much any player no matter how bad of a player they are.  Watching theyre play on draft breakdown will give you a much better picture ,minnesotavikings,cpxio1o,5,t5_2qocl

Three down linemen three LBs three safeties two corners. One of the LBs would be Barr who could creep up and rush or hang back and cover. And one of the safeties would essentially be a LB hello Taylor Mays. He did this in Cincy with James Harrison. Although when you look at the  that way its actually a  considering that one of the LBs is rushing and one of the DBs is playing linebacker.

3959466,0,t1_cr7dly4,The benefit this year is that adding Kendricks makes every formation but especially  overall more effective in pass coverage. Plus with Barr rushing or dropping and Kendricks most likely dropping allows us to be reallly really flexble with the rd LB in the set. Go heavy on the front  Griffen|Floyd|JohnsonCrichton and have another primarily rush LB or go Griffen|Floyd|RobisonCrichton and then rely less on the rd LB to rush the passer yeah Im high on Crichton as a pass rusher from the edge amp interior.Im kinda spitballing but my main point is that the addition of Kendricks and maturation of the Dline especially if Crichton develops allows the  to be played to its full capacity more effectively. Each piece will arguably be better at doing its respective jobs. Also helps that we can have Rhodes and Waynes on the outside so the extra DB rd safety or rd CB can be any of Munnerlyn my personal favorite Mays Exum if hes not starting Anthony Harris Robinson etc.God Im excited for this season.,minnesotavikings,cr7m272,1,t5_2qocl

4129441,0,t1_crqxv28,So now the options are much smaller offseason rosters were talking  down to  maybe  to help cut down on dead money costs which means less talent to evaluate and more people that have to go work real jobs like us peasants oh the humanity. The NFL doesnt even have to make it a rule teams just wouldnt sign as many players because they couldnt afford to. That would still lead to at least double the dead money teams see now. Raising the cap any significant amount to cover the insane rise in dead cap money which would make about a dozen teams in the NFL unprofitable including the Vikings meaning they are going to fold. But we dont need  teams anyway its kind of overkill right?Or just give all the players guaranteed contracts. Lets say for arguments sake that somehow all teams stay profitable and manage to stay under the cap. Now you sign a player and youre stuck with them until the contract is over. Even if they decline like crazy dont want to play anymore get a ton of injures etc. Because you will always owe that debt.Or we could.....nope thats pretty much the only way to get all players fully guaranteed contracts and all would be detrimental to teams and the game.Fully guaranteed contracts are only good for the players period. And considering that AP said Crazy that one side has so much power. Yet he thinks the logical thing to do is give the players all of the power? Yeah okay.The NFL will never see fully guaranteed contracts because it isnt a feasible option. This isnt Baseball or Basketball where teams have to field  people plus backups at a maximum. This is the NFL where there are  starting positions plus their backups. It absolutely blows my mind that the only argument you people have is someone could figure it out. Come back with some original ideas or quit trying to argue people that are obviously putting actual thought and effort into the situation. Just because you dont want to use your brain doesnt mean other people arent. Give me a break. ,minnesotavikings,crqzau0,1,t5_2qocl

Now Id take Kendricks over Cann too but Id have traded down from  to take a slightly lesser DB snagged an extra secondrounder and taken Cann with it. Thats not hard. Or traded up to snipe Cann from Jacksonville.But good news about the minor injury. I still like the value of Clemmings and think well be just fine but LG was our number one weakness going into the offseason.

It is no secret Bahktiari struggles big time in the run game but given his favorable positioning he should have been capable of at least delaying most players.

So if we have a good season because Patterson Waynes and Clemmings  all do really well then the credit will be split between Zimmer and Spielman.

4607976,0,t1_ctbb7sf,Learn how to read between the lines. My analysis is  percent based on what Adrian or his agent said nothing more. Why did Rick and Zimm have to fly down to Texas and beg him to stay? Why was there zero commitment from AD to return if It was important for me to continue my career in Minnesota when he was ALREADY UNDER CONTRACT. He was smart in not saying that he didnt want to come back. He let his and his agents actions speak for him because he would have to be pretty damn stupid to tell an entire fan base to fuck off while still being under contract. He knew there was a real solid chance he would still be playing here because for the umteenth time he was under contract so outright disenfranchising his entire fan base would have been a pretty terrible idea.,minnesotavikings,ctbf3hf,-1,t5_2qocl

We know hes amazing as PFFs  safety last year but he cant argue he deserves Earl Thomas money when people dont even know his name and he has zero accolades to back up a big contract.Maybe theyre worried about him staying healthy or they want to know what they have better before taking their chance with a long contract?

As someone who has smoked daily for  years I personally do not notice a difference falling asleep with or without smoking. I think the people giving it a reputation as a miracle drug are the people who have been newly exposed to it. I dont feel like it has impeded me from doing anything in my life so far but I have several friends who have more or less dedicated their existence to it and it hurts their professionalsocial lives.HOWEVER compared to pain killerssleeping pills that literally slowly kill your body it is a VERY healthy alternative. Theres a reason pharmaceutical companies are opposed to legalization their sales would plummet.  Edit ProTip for falling asleep Turn your screens off and shut your eyes.

Hate it when I see a player wearing that speed revolution design. Dennis Ryan the equipment manager seems to think there is no other way to put the logo on that design without splitting the logo. Even though a hand full of teams  such as the Bills and  Dolphins have a similar issue. He is worried how grass gets under the logo and creates a sticky mess. Why do these other teams not have a problem with it?  All he has to do is not take the backing off the logo in the area of the vent hole. Problem solved.

The bullshit conspiracy theories on a hat Mike zimmer says and what he actually means ignoring any fact that contradicts their theory. How about we just dont talk about him and see how he performs the next two seasons at more than a reasonable price? Then we decide if he worked out for us and we resign him or just let him leave.,minnesotavikings,cufeyra,28,t5_2qocl

4954300,0,t1_cuj0ec1,You guys didnt seem too high on your draftLots of people agreeing with me...I have concerns with our draft too however. Two things our top need was LG. And we didnt address it. Were moving our RG to LG and then plugging some other RGs and RTs in there. We drafted three th round and later guys to fill us out. Not good IMHO. Ive been saying this for a LONG time. Other problem? Waynes at  is odd. I said all along we should trade down snag another second rounder and take a different DB. Peters Jones Collins... whomever. All worth it if we get AJ Cann out of it. Been saying this for some time as well.Otherwise? Our draft was awesome. And free agency was sweet too.Of course were only guessing. I mean Waynes could bust my concerns at oline could all come to fruition and Kendricks may end up being a tweener LB without a true position etc. and some of your picks could blossom with the right tutelage and system. Who knows? Everyone judges drafts immediately so dont get your panties in a bunch on that point.Williams is getting older sure and House got overpaid. I understand those. All Im saying this whole time is weak offseasondraft will cost you a game. Jordys injury get well soon buddy might cost you a game all by itself.  last year   this year. And I know you have a tough schedule because we share most of our schedules together...We were  last year. Teddy not being a rookie plus a good offseason and a year of seasoning for important young players like Rhodes Barr etc. is worth at LEAST a game. AD is worth at least a game. No way  even with our harder schedule  were not at least . Plus we had a ton of injuries last year.,minnesotavikings,cuj12ok,1,t5_2qocl

The Friday after Thanksgiving we agreed to meet some of her good friends who still live in the area out for dinner. While we were in the bar waiting for everyone to arrive there was quite a bit of commotion down at the opposite end of the bar. There was a  foot tall bald headed African American guy at the end of the bar. Everyone was snapping pictures getting autographs and buying this guy drinks. I asked some fat drunk lady whats going on over there? She said its Donald Driver as she is getting her cell phone out. The guy did not look like Donald Driver at all. Please note this was  Drivers last season and the Packers were playing the Giants in New York on Sunday. But this random bald headed black guy was soaking up the attention and getting free drinks. As he walked by me I was laughing pretty hard the guy smiled and gave me a wink. I wasnt going to ruin his evening by calling him out. The old saying in Green Bay was always if you were African American you were either a Packer or just passing through. This guy was definitely just passing through but getting a ton of drinks for being bald.,minnesotavikings,cuqoyij,45,t5_2qocl

5643405,0,t1_cwwjjfm,Dirty doesnt have to imply that he had intent to injure TB. Dirty is a style of play. In my opinion Joyner wanted to lay a hit on TB for scrambling. Teddy had been killing them with his legs. The problem is Joyner had no problem lowering his shoulder and launching into a sliding QB. That is dirty. You want to hit the qb when he runs I get it. But do so within the rules. Williams coached teams play through the whistle and then some.

Try betting on basketball and youll quickly see how apparent it is that its fixed.  In the nfl the refs have so much control and penalties are so vague that they can call a penalty on any play they want to. Its so easy to swing a game however they want.Now have the Vikings been victim of this before? Of course  being the most glaring example anyone who says otherwise is insane. I wouldnt say its a yearly thing against us as Im pretty sure every team has been on the butt end of it but if you pay enough attention the betting lines scores and games themselves its pretty easy to figure it out.

I feel like some of our other safeties charge in and fly for a big hit but Harris knows to break down even if it means  more yards. Thats a great place for a rookie UDFA to be as we continue to develop him. He also blew up a short yardage run play which was kinda baffling because thats not what hes supposed to be able to do at all. But its not all perfect  he let up a huge pass to Fitz by being late to the ball and got his ass pancaked by Fitz on that touchdown where Waynes abandoned his zone. The first problem is an experience thing the second one is a size issue that would be a liability for his whole career should we decide to use him.Hunters tenacity impresses me but hes always trying to get away. Id like to see him bull rush more instead of handfight. Good tackles can just let you handfight all day and keep you in front he has to use his power. But he got by plenty of times tonight and for a  year old rookie DE I love where hes headed.Tom Johnson filled in admirably as always. He gets stuffed sometimes gets eluded sometimes but hell make a play or two and be a factor. Steady as they come which is exactly what you expect from a veteran backup.Edmond Robinson looked invisible today which is good and bad.Bottom line  of course we missed Smith Barr and Joseph tonight but the backups came in and played admirably. It burned us sometimes no denying that. But a lot of the problems boiled down to youth which I dont really mind.,minnesotavikings,cxv2kln,2,t5_2qocl

5917074,0,t1_cxv66lc,I do too. Logically. But I really really am getting to the point where Im unable to watch close games. I really dont know how Id be able to watch us play in a superbowl. Ill never forget or remember the  ship. I had some ambien at the time for some reason and after the secon or third? turnover I stormed upstairs from my mancave and took an ambien. My plan was to go to sleep. Because I could just see the writing on the wall. But my parents were over and when my head hit the pillow my dad would yell BEANERY he calls me that for some reason Ive never understood ITS NOT OVER YET GET BACK DOWN HERE! and Id run back down wed fumble it and Id go back upstairs and eat some Ambien. I was holding onto this little rock my mom gave me that said miracles do happen struggling to maintain a consistent heart beat and watching Childress that smug bastard take a time out and then send  men on the field AFTERWARDS to take us out of FG range and change our future forever. The game last night felt A LOT like the  Ship. Actually. The turnovers. The I GIVE UP moments that turned into misguided hope shortly after. The multiple chances to win or rather the  different things that couldve happened to allow us to win Rhodes making that INT that Waynes INT counting the fumbles not happening the Cardinals bus exploding on the way to the game etc. Either way. I agree?  ,minnesotavikings,cxv9d0n,-4,t5_2qocl

5923617,0,t1_cxw20eh,Its a fairly human thing to manage expectations. And I think its a fairly different thing when the immediate prior experience fans have four days earlier with those three players being out is annihilation and then they get to go up against the top offense in the NFL. So maybe your team is complete enough to deal with major injuries or at least for a quarter but the Vikings literally promoted a practice squad player for one safety position and started him immediately while converting a yearold cornerback for the other. They moved their pound threetech to nose tackle a position that had previously been filled by a guy who weighs  pounds more. The guy replacing Barr was inactive the previous game and was nearly cut in camp because you know thround rookie.It is reasonable to expect a team whose strength is defense to do poorly against the top team in the NFL especially when they got boatraced four days prior with an arguably superior setup the only reason they promoted Harris from the PS is because their third safety Exum got put on IR. And it is a human thing to not want to get hurt.,minnesotavikings,cxw48mk,16,t5_2qocl

6228842,0,t1_cyxmcm4,I think the biggest problem for us outside of OL which will get better is the lack of a dominant  WR and we have to get one somehow. We tried to do that with the Jennings signing and then getting Wallace and maybe thats the best thats available but I think Alshon is a better talent than either. Maybe we can find a superstar through the draft which would be ideal but honestly its always a crapshoot and picking at  makes it even worse.Looking at the safety FA market it seems like theres a fair amount of talent out there so hopefully we can pick someone up for a reasonable price. I definitely dont think we should overpay there but at WR we really really need a playmaker.Realistically I think trading AP is the boldest move here by the front office and thats what we all take for granted ITT,minnesotavikings,cyxnh61,1,t5_2qocl

What is likely is that if we were to draft Jack Kendricks would come off in passing situations since Jack is so good in coverage. So Kendricks would maybe see the field  of the time? If that? But yeah I feel as though drafting Jack would be one of the picks that would least improve our team in the first round. Im not saying hes a bad player but the improvement he would provide to our team would pale in comparison to other choices we could make if he is even there.

6290409,0,t3_41r5ds,Bottom line its going to come down to how Norv AD and the OL shake out.Third year in an offense is nice but Norv needs to let Teddy spread his paws fly. Hell he shoulda fucking did that this year and let Teddy make mistakes this wasnt our year to be a legit SB contender. He had to be told to be conservative and play not to lose. We absolutely needed him learn in a trial by fire way where hes free to be aggressive and just let it go while making mistakes. Not next year but this year we did. Do you recall him ever audibling? How about the many times hed get the D to jump offsides but wasnt it always a run play and when not never taking a shot deep on the free play. OL pass pro was shit but what do you expect? Norv tips our hand to the D where when we want to pass we go into a passing formation telling the DL yep all out rush. Conversely we line up in a heavy set and run again telling the D to key AD. McKinnon had some success running mostly because he would from more balanced or passing formations. If we continue to give away our plays like that an improved line still wont help as much as everyone seems to think here.We all wanted to see what Teddy and AD could do together. Oh how magical it was going to be right? Welp we seen it and given the plays Norv calls both cannot coexist in his offense I definitely believe that it could have. So its time to move on from AD. With McKinnon and a rdth round pick well be fine and free up m. Side note Teddy is an amazing escape artist and whether its him andor our WR when he extends the play we must take advantage down the field.

You cant and wont know how a player will transition to the Pro level.From NFL.coms draft analysis of Matt Kalil in gtKalil is the undisputed top tackle prospect in this years draft after two successful years starting on the left side for USC. He is an earlyentry junior who has been a reliable blindside protector for Matt Barkley. He has all the physical tools to achieve success at the next level and has continued to develop his game technically. Kalil has an NFL pedigree as his dad was a former semiprofessional player and his older brother Ryan is a consistent Pro Bowl center for the Carolina Panthers. He should be the first lineman off the board and could easily be a topfive pick and immediately hold down the starting left tackle position for an NFL team.I guess he didnt pan out exactly as expected.

Youre basing the lackofseparation argument on the Reception Perception article and Im basing it on my impression when I watch his play. Im not arguing Boyd has elite separation skills. Im arguing he has shown enough flashes for me to predict he will be able to develop that skill well.I dont really agree with the notion that numbercracking will lead to finding the best prospects necessarily. I get it because we live in the internet age and everyone is trying to get their blog noticed with a new algorithm or whatever but so many of those stats arent necessarily predictive. To me this is one such case.I dont care how often Boyd or Doctson or Thomas or whoever beat ltinsert coverage heregt in the NCAA. I care how they did it.

I think we could wait until the fourth or fifth though if we wanted to add a depth receiver. If we did want to draft a receiver in the third Id rather go with Miller because he has a ton of potential and seems to actually be a hard worker.

7719408,0,t1_d3i6imn,Thats OK. At least you recognized my true yet sarcastic statement.The fact is last year was a down year for ALL RBs. Obviously minus a few samples from here or there. AP was the leading rusher for the year but even he wasnt happy with it. Why do you think hes taking part in the OTAs? Another thing is AP losing a step is still better than most backs in the league. I agree hes lost a step but I feel its not as big of one as people think it is. Weve been spoiled watching him this last decade or so. We expect a certain standard and it is unfair for us at this point in his career to keep that expectation. Leveon is arguably more agile definitely a better receiver and has less wear and tear. However AP ran behind what can be considered the most disgusting offensive line in his career last season. So before we say X is better than Y lets remember that hes still easily top  and it wouldnt be surprising if he repeated as the number .,minnesotavikings,d3jn6m3,1,t5_2qocl

We werent getting much out of him and he might not have been worth much without a good quarterback. Keep in mind he wasnt productive in Oakland either. Should we STILL have kept him? Maybe.

7977465,0,t1_d4cm4co,Honestly Im not too optimistic about our receiver corp this year mainly because its the same receiver corp as last year without one starter in Wallace who admittedly didnt produce either I think itll be fine but nothing to write home about or scoff at any FA over. Then we added a rookie and its rare for a rookie WR to produce like  per draft class produces their rookie year and with getting news that Price is shutting him down Id say he might take a year or two to be the receiver we want like most first round WR picks. Even if you believe in him its a lot of faith in one unproven guy.When we have young guys that havent produced whats the harm in bringing in some veterans? Better a hasbeen than a neverwas. I like Roddy White and we arent above or too good to pick up an old veteran to our corp.,minnesotavikings,d4cqqu5,6,t5_2qocl

Ill give you three that arent my opinion theyre Zimmer and the coaching staffs opinion. Mechanics need significant help deep ball is inaccurate and hes hesitant to throw aggressively down field to nfl open guys. Again not my opinion Zimmer and the coaching staff specifically pointed these out as weaknesses to work on this offseason. You can argue with them but if he stagnates and isnt more aggressive throwing the ball isnt more accurate on the deep ball and his mechanics dont get better you can bet the conversation isnt he went from flawless to flawless you cant improve on perfection high five. Its is this really his ceiling his deep ball mechanics and ability to throw to nfl open guys wont improve we got to think about the future differently now.And no Shaun hills not better I dont understand how thats remotely relevant to teddys progression,minnesotavikings,d52ifh0,1,t5_2qocl

Teddys much much more accurate throwing deep when theres a horizontal element to the throw i.e. he struggles when hes throwing over a receiver rather than to the receiver and we dont really have anyone that specializes in running inside. All of our deep throws seem to come on crosses and outs where theres limited space for a receiver to work to gain YAC.I have no idea whether or not this combination will be successful but this write up has me excited to see whether or not Norv can redeem himself.,minnesotavikings,d5f38jy,10,t5_2qocl

8648375,0,t1_d6mn9sg,Thats true thats a possibility but Patterson is the best in the league at returning kicks and its no secret. Teams are smart and will probably just go for the touchback more often than not. Big thing that killed him as a receiver is not listening to the Zimmaster and choosing to train by himself that one summer instead of with Irvin. Zim seems like the kind of person you dont want to go against if you want good things to happen to yourself.,minnesotavikings,d6mnq7c,1,t5_2qocl
8651361,0,t1_d6n092q,gt Show me one wide receiver over  that came back  from an ACL tear. Specifically one whose main asset is their speed.Sure Jerry Rice did it when he was . Welker did it when he was . Joey Galloway did it when he was . Unless you think there is some magical line that you cross when you are  these are all comparable examples. gt They were also one play away from missing the playoffs completely. If that Hail Mary against Detroit falls incomplete then the lions sweep the packers and take their spot in the playoffs.And I could say the same thing about the Vikings in their close wins during the regular season? Come on man you can have better points than that. gt Congrats you beat the redskins one of the worst teams to ever make the playoffs. Meanwhile the Vikings should have beaten one of the best teams in the league over the last  years.Shoulda woulda coulda. Doesnt change the fact that we went further in the playoffs. gt Im not sure how this is relevant at all when all but two of those wins were with Christian Ponder or Brett Favres skeleton playing QB.Because its the same reasoning why the Patriots have the edge over the Jets or Buffalo even though they change QBs all the time. Head to head match up record within the past are indicative. If you want to get technical we are  against you guys in the past  years. The first game was with Ponder and was a  beat down if you think Teddy B playing his rookie year would have made the difference in that game then Ill leave that up to you lol. Other than that Packers are  against Teddy B. ,minnesotavikings,d6n17od,-5,t5_2qocl
8651853,0,t1_d6mxq50,I guess the reasoning for me listing the historical consistency is more that the core that gets them deep into the playoffs EVERY year is still intact while the Panthers havent had  winning seasons in a row for a decade or more.

There is a lot of respect given both ways. A lot of coaches get up there and treat the reporters poorly and then are shocked when the reporters act in an adversarial way. That or they use the chance at the podium to boost their egos. With Zimmer its like youre sitting down with a friend and shooting the bull.A perfect example of this is the question about Peterson playing next game. Zimmer wouldnt answer but he respected the reporters asking the question and explained his rational for not saying. So yeah he didnt answer the question but you understand and respect why. ,minnesotavikings,d6tsi0w,25,t5_2qocl

All kinds of things.  We just dont know.What we do know is that this is currently a very talented team that lacked only a quarterback.  We hoped Teddys progression hes only  was going to elevate him to be that guy.  Hes gone now.  Bradford is in.  If Bradford can play his best football and stay healthy there is a chance that Sammy Two Sleeves can add his name to the long list of mediocre QBs with superbowl rings.  For all we know due to unforseen events this could very well be the best chance the Vikings have to win a superbowl in the next decade.  I mean what if Teddy is never the same or doesnt progress as much as expected and by the time we have someone decent the rest of the talent has eroded?You gotta take your shots.

8915229,0,t1_d7jguxm,Thanks for the great post! I agree with much of what you have so eloquently stated. I agree I should most likely pump the brakes because its only week one and he had a tough match up. I think most of my displeasure in Johnson comes from his tenure with the team. I just have never been overly impressed with his game. We will need to see what we get from him week  but if its much of the same I really think its more beneficial to get the ball rolling on Treadwell. I also completely disagree with him needing to look for the ball sooner this only slows down a receivers momentum. It was just a slight overthrow. ,minnesotavikings,d7jha9q,4,t5_2qocl

9414315,0,t3_59l65k,I thought this part was interesting and might be a bit illuminating to all the Fire Norv hes too predictable! commentarygt Last Friday as the Vikings headed into their bye week I wrote in my All column that there was a silver lining to Adrian Petersons absence This offense has an opportunity to develop a more stylistically diverse rushing attack. Peterson is an all time great but as an inherently impatient runner hes largely confined to straightahead carries. You dont see many outside or misdirection runs with him. All things equal youd take AP over Jerick McKinnon and Matt Asiata a dozen times out of . But if youre stuck with McKinnon and Asiata at least you can run more out of shotgun and to the perimeter mainly with McKinnon.gt Except heres Part B of that equation The Vikings ran mostly northsouth to accommodate not only Peterson but their offensive line as well. This front five is not athletic enough to consistently reach the perimeter get out in space or land blocks on the move. Thats why Turners ground game even in Petersons absence still mostly runs behind oldfashioned plowahead doubleteam blocks. This ground game might be a little more diverse without Petersonits shotgun rushing numbers have almost tripled for examplebut by no means is it multifaceted. The diversity you do see tends to be gimmicky wildcats endarounds the occasional Hback wrinkle. Not surprisingly this rushing attack ranks st in yards per game ..,minnesotavikings,d99bwa3,10,t5_2qocl

9474395,0,t3_5ajq9e,Bradford played well for what he had and the god awful play calling. At this point it seems to me like we need to blow up the offensive line. I just dont understand how it can still be so bad with so many additions and a new coach... moreover Norvs play calling has reverted to what it looked like last year. We are going to lose every fucking game when we run Asiata that many times. Complete lack of creativity running up the gut on almost every first down. Anybody that watches this team knows that our success lays in short creative pass plays. With all that being said however the thing Im most concerned with is the defense. Two full games in a row now where we have looked underwhelming at best. At worst we just straight up look bad. Blown coverages missed tackles droppedtipped interceptions and a complete lack of pressure on the QB. they have one sacks in two games. I dont know whats going on but for two whole games now we have been outplayed and outcoached by teams we should have very easily beaten. Its like we have no gameplan. Im very troubled by what weve seen. Pretty much regression on all fronts.

Oh you find it interesting do you? Interesting that youre seeing exactly what you want to see as per the entire purpose of your sub?Telling you your experiment is broken and nonsense is completely unrelated to the Vikings or Packers fandom. Its broken because its broken not because Im a Vikings fan. Nobody has fallen for your passive aggressive BS here and apparently thats interesting to you. Again this is not an experiment. This is you using confirmation bias to make it look like your team is more relevant to the rest of us than it is.

Take your BS elsewhere its clearly not welcome here.EditgtLions sub has been almost completely silent the Bears have asked for clarification LMAO you fucking bullshitter.

9850996,0,t3_5g7sgr,Robison seems to play more of the early snaps for veteran reasons. He is great at reading the screen passes draws and general trickery that someone younger like Hunter may be a little bit more susceptible to. Atleast thats my theory.Robison also plays DT on obvious passing plays for the  man rush. This indicates to me that Robison is a pros pro. Works hard does what he needs to do. Obviously he isnt a slouch and still plays some snaps even when it isnt as a DE I have even seen him as an OLB on rare occasion. Zimmer likes his vets I assume because veterans are less likely to get burned. Even if they dont always get the rd down stop theyre less likely to give up  yards on a single play. Which really kills our conservative run the clock style.Also Hunters specialty coming out of college was the run. That and being a monster thats as buff as the biggest OLineman are big. He was considered very very raw as a pass rusher with only . sacks to his credit coming out of college as a Junior and I think  his Sophomore year. He was seen as a run destroyer with potential to be next level and a candidate for st round pick if he stayed for his senior year. Kinda the opposite of what Clowney was slated as but in my biased opinion.. has out performed in almost all categories. Most of all being playing time.I would lt for him to sub in for Griffen a little more often. And Trattou for RobisonHunters spot for Hunters rotation of Robison.

10152051,0,t1_dbtzz7g,Well I will say that I was absolutely wrong about Adam Thielen and its entirely possible that Im wrong about our quarterbacks as well.  Heck I thought that Christian Ponder Tarvaris Jackson and Joe Webb had the it factor at one point or another.If I look back at the last decade the one thing that I think has consistently held back the team was the conservative offensive strategy.  Its not as fun to watch as the highflying downfield game that the Vikings ran in the late s but more so its that the more conservative the offense the less they are capable of recovering from mistakes and coming from behind.Whatever happens next year Ill support the team and by September I will be convinced nobody in the league can beat them.  The problem at quarterback is the best problem at quarterback the Vikings have had since Brad Johnson and Randal Cunningham were on the roster.  The real issue on offense is figuring out the running game and the offensive line.  Do that and whatever Zimmer wants on defense and this team is on its way.,minnesotavikings,dbush9b,3,t5_2qocl

He has no run game and a crappy OL but hes got a pretty solid receiving corps and was running an offense designed around taking the pressure off of the OL.I think outside of his first read throws his accuracy is a lot like Alex Smiths. Its good enough to get a completion in most situations but he really doesnt do his receivers any favors with the placement. And if our WR talent suddenly drops off to where it was in the Teddy years were screwed. Ask guys like Wright or Johnson to make the kinds of catches Thielen was making this year and it just wont happen.

11793463,0,t3_689qls,So I watched some Pat Elflein tape  games last night after the draft...Pros Hes a great technician. There were only a few cases in all the games I watched where his technique failed him. Hes very good at realizing who he has to block on pass plays when the defense is trying to get around him. Again only had a couple cases where this fell through in the games I watched.Cons  I can see where the physicality concerns come fromhe isnt the strongest guy coming out of college. On the couple cases his technique wasnt solid he got completely bowled over by DLinemen. Stronger interior linemen would still be able to get some push in those situations. While hes quickfooted in his technique and setting his stance he is slow footed in situations where he has to pull. ProCon As Spielman said in his presser he appears to be a bit hotheaded in games as well. He plays hard as a result but sometimes borderline goes too far after a play is done he doesnt always stop blocking a guy when the whistle is blown. Id be concerned if he went WAY over the top on plays did dumb stuff and got penalized but he never went too far from the games I watched.Honestly he seems like he could start day  at Center for us potential but with us switching to a more zone based scheme with more guard pulls in run plays Id worry about him starting a little bit at OG day  given his current level of strength and pulling speed.I think his strength issues can be fixed by a NFL strength amp conditioning routine but I wouldnt expect them to be fixed until year  at least. Although I think wed all much rather worry about a player getting stronger than a strong guy who has trash technique...,minnesotavikings,dgwtujr,17,t5_2qocl

In Laels case his ex gf was killed a couple of months before the draft. Police gad already came out and cleared him of not being a suspect because I believe he wasnt even in the state at the time she was killed. Well police were questioning him at the time of the draft about the victim since he knew her well after already clearing him as a suspect. Well NFL teams just avoided him altogether because of it. He went from a st round pick to undrafted losing out of millions as a result. Basically he got screwed out of millions for essentially no reason. As a fan of both players im sympathetic. ,minnesotavikings,dgx7fjp,2,t5_2qocl
