3184533,0,t3_2wlqg9,Im looking specifically for someone who was a union electrician when the legislation passed chose to stay union and pay their dues and how it affected them. Im wondering if they saw a reduction in benefits or wages if they saw union market share dive etc.Anybody from Michigan or Indiana? I know right to work was passed in both those states in  and they seem like they would otherwise have a similar work climate to Wisconsin.,IBEW,cos2rsa,2,t5_2tzsz

9739277,0,t3_5ehr6x,Umm what kind of local is this that they can just fire an apprentice like that? Our union has rules even if they fire or lay off an apprentice they cant pick up a different apprentice. They have to hire that one back first. I would raise a shit storm if the foreman blamed you for your coworkers fuck up. Call the hall call the project manager If you did nothing wrong they can do that.,IBEW,dadku78,1,t5_2tzsz

10402294,0,t1_dcn0bvr,Im in the same boat thankful to have no kids at the moment. If electrical work is what you want to do sorry to say but it wont get better elsewhere. A pretty respectable non union electrical shop started apprentices wo experience at exactly . Its not an issue with the trades its cultural. Very very few employers pay well enough to put any noticeable money into savings or retirement anywhere any profession. And most well paying professions come at high educational costdebt. The more you make the more owe someone. I dont just look at the hourly rate. If Im stuck at a job that isnt teaching me anything I can use or apply elsewhere and especially if I dont have any kids to worry about Im a goner. Sure I wish Id have started earlier also. Im  but that isnt gonna keep me from doing what I want to do. And keep in mind that in construction everything is always in flux. Some of the guys go their whole careers terrified of being laid off. Im not gonna do that. Ill be smart with my money and put it aside to weather the down times. But if stability is high on your list of priorities Id recommend looking into other avenues. Maintenance is where I started really learning to like my job. Pay doesnt go up quick but its steadier and certainly a lot easier than construction work physically speaking.,IBEW,dcn60n2,1,t5_2tzsz

11314713,0,t3_61f6nb,Show up early you get to relax before work. Show that you want to learn. Write things down. Stay busy on the job site. Journeymen will teach you or at least put you in a spot you will be useful.Im a first year like you will be. Its hard not knowing anything but they should and will teach you. A lot is on you though so study. Homework is online know and is a great way to prepare for tests. Good luck on DC Theory!,IBEW,dfei6hr,4,t5_2tzsz
