As I was previously staff I know how to SS use livechat and generally be a staff member. I am a very nice nontoxic person and am always willing to lend a helping hand to the community. I am always reading chat and on TeamSpeak so I am easy to contact. Also I am a very active player and am willing to devote lots of my time to iPvP. I can spend  hours on weekends and  hours on weekdays on iPvP. I can also multitask which is a very important aspect of being staff. I am able to be tping to reports helping players in chat and helping people on livechat at the same time. I also know how to screenshare players and am experienced in catching cheaters. Have you had any past experience? Yes I have owned two factions server which eventually went down because I ran out of cash and as I previously said I was moderator on iPvPWhen did you join iPvP?  months agoAre you staff member on any other servers? No I was previously moderator on the iPvP Network but resigned and I am looking to come backWhy do you want to become staff? Before I begin my application let me just start off by saying yes I know I resigned and you normally do not get accepted back after applying but I feel that after it being a  weeks since I resigned I am ready to come back and will not resign this time. My grades started dropping and I started no lifeing iPvP because at the time there were not many active staff members and I wanted to keep my job as moderator. If I am welcomed back into the staff team I will try my hardest to do an even better of a job as moderator and even though I may be a tiny bit less active like  to  hours less on weekends I am still willing to be active and work my hardest to make the iPvP network a better community. So I would like to become staff on the iPvP network because I am ready to come back and would like to help iPvP as much as I possibly could.About me My IRL name is Aidan im  years old and play Lacrosse. I am in th grade and love playing video games in my spare time. I started with simple iOS games like Clash of Clans DragonVale and then began to play computer games and have pretty much stuck with them ever since.PS I know some of you may have not thought I did a good job as moderator but please keep these friendly comments. Thank you for reading my application have a nice day.,ipvp_network,cx0i010,1,t5_3al39

I was an avid host on the Badlion network and and fulltime moderator on their faction server for a number of maps. Im a very active player and moderator. I know when I need to moderate and I know when I can relax and play. Along with activity of moderation Ill always have access to Slack and Skype either via Mobile or PC. I can play upwards of  to  hours on weekdays and  on weekends. These Are the reasons i Think i Should Be Have you had any past experience? Yes i have been Mod On Para And I Have Been a Admin On a Opfactions server called velocity When did you join iPvP? I joined ipvp about a  months ago and Ive Decided I Should Not Let all these hackers go on And Help the Community and Because a staff member And Ban Those Dirty hackers Are you staff member on any other servers? No i no Longer Staff on Any other Server Why do you want to become staff? I would want to moderate on this server as I feel as if I could really benefit the community. I have seen this server grow so much recently and strangely it brings a warm feeling knowing how well the server is doing and how well it is going to expand to be. I enjoy helping people and in some way I believe one of my purposes in life is to help others. I believe I can help the community and server expand. I would help the server by using a dynamic route and approach as I feel as if every server I have been staff on I have used this approach and it has grown the servers and highly benefited the community. About me Ive been playing video games since I was a little kid starting out with a gameboy color and a PS. Ever since then Ive been addicted to any video game I can pick up from DOOM to Counterstrike. I play both varsity soccer and tennis for my school. Ive been playing Minecraft since  and I plan to continue until I see that its no longer fun for me Or Everyone Starts Hacking And it Has no Point,ipvp_network,cxgtno5,1,t5_3al39
