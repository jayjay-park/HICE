So interacting with a foreigner probably allows her to feel shes not breaking some rule she believes in because the foreigner doesnt know about it.She does seem  uptight though even for a Saudi.

Guess who she have to get approval from if the fatherhusband both past away?? The elder son !!my mom have the exact situation my big brother have to submit an electronic paper that allows her to travel.another thing there are many cases of Saudis who had big problem with their wives that cannot be fixed but they dont file a divorce they just marry the second wife and leave the first one just hanged there not married and not divorced courts are full of cases like this for years.Im a Saudi and Im a  sure that Saudi Arabia is not a good place to raise your children not until the people controls the country not the other way around,saudiarabia,ch385i5,1,t5_2roj4

2903815,0,t3_2tdrbf,Ok here we go.First of all Saudi Arabia is a big country not all places are the same. the quality of life differs from one place to the other. To sum it up the closer they are to the eastern borders the better but I guess they will be teaching in Riyadh since thats where all the foreign business takes place.As for your questions regarding visa I cant help you sorry.Women cant go to tourist attractions without a man.During prayers I recommend that they stay in a car its OK to just walk around but sometimes the religious police lose their minds and forget that there are nonmuslims in Saudi and might arrest them.No they arent allowed to worship privately several months ago I heard that the religious police arrested people who were doing just that. please note that laws against other religions are exclusive to the country and not islam islam has nothing against other religionsthere are gyms exclusive for women by that I mean no men are allowed inside but during my time in Riyadh which wasnt much assuming they will live there I didnt see that many womenonly gyms. No. there are no cinmas. however we do have Virgin megastores and you can crack Netflix and HBOGO to work in Saudi.Ive only used shipping once and I didnt find any troubles. My brother however buys everything from USA and I hear him complain every now and then so maybe there are problems with shipping from USA.I dont know much about the government policy towards complaining on the internet but id tell them to avoid that just in case.dumb questions are a part of the daily life Saudi.around high school. But not to worry foreigners can wear abyas that cover almost nothing and not cover their faces. Only Saudi females are obliged.Music instruments can be found at Virgin megastores but then again id  tell them to stay clear.I see foreigners in Jeddah Riyadh and the Eastern Province.,saudiarabia,cny64at,-1,t5_2roj4

3565704,0,t3_31544e,Just one quick note actually. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy not a totalitarian state. Saudi Arabia doesnt censor everything and if you read the newspapers even the English ones youll easily find satirical cartoons lampooning policy decisions cultural norms and even clear displeasure with certain policies. Ive read editorials about the usefulness of the religious police and their efficacy for example that were respectfully critical. You have to take the time to understand a countrys system of governance and not jump to conclusions. Its also worth noting that while Saudi Arabia is generally a conservative country Riyadh is the most austere while other areas like Dharan or Jeddah are more relaxed. You wont fine a liberal city in Saudi but theyre not the whipcracking taskmasters the news makes them out to be. ,saudiarabia,cpypt8t,9,t5_2roj4

4267042,0,t1_cs66tlu,RaaRs point however is that while impact may be increasing much of it may not be attributable to homegrown talent and her data does seem to be showing that. Collaboration statistics like this can go up when for example the government funds research in foreign universities with the stipulation that they must collaborate with professors in Saudi Arabia to ensure Saudi universities names are on them essentially buying papers. They can also go up through grassroots means maybe there really is more contact between Saudi and international researchers. Anecdotally from what I hear from former colleagues Id second RaaRs views. As someone who is deeply connected to the Saudi university community though not personally part of it anymore Ive been hearing more of the former of the above two explanations than the latter. An example is the Center for Clean Water and Clean Energy at MIT which is funded by KFUPM and Saudi Aramco. Ive also been hearing of professors kept on the books by Saudi universities through funding and publishing papers in its name but not physically living in the country.

5220055,0,t1_cvf5vtt,gt For me one thing that seems noticeable about rSaudi is that there is almost no criticism of the current regime. Its not that. Its just that recently theres been a plethora of bad press and people on this sub went on the defensive because they felt that they are being attacked. Every time something bad about Saudi is reported the entire population is blamed. We get called savages barbarians and other things. The problem is that we feel that by acknowledging these things we are contributing to our own demonization. Other highly demonized countries like Iran and Pakistan sometimes get a break from newspapers like The Guardian or The Huffington Post or on social media pages like Humans of New York however I do acknowledge that Iranians in particular have always had it worse because of the sanctions that devastated them and it makes me happy to know that they will soon be free of them. But we the Arabians of Saudi never get such a break. We are always savages barbarians ignorant fat lazy radical misogynist and secretly hoping ISIS would overthrow the AlSauds and rule us. And the way people talk about us in the news and such makes us feel as if we the people are being targeted not just the regime. Then there is fear. People here are afraid of being arrested or something for speaking against the regime. On top of that unlike neighboring countries the Saudi population has been practically isolated from the rest of the world before the s. The ideas of civil society and political organization have never reached anyone but the very few members of the social elite who studied in Egypt and Iraq and brought these ideas with them when they came back. Not to mention that the only source of information since the s was the religious establishment. While the rest of the region was opening up Saudi was closing down. Television was only introduced in the s for the first time and even then it was very limited. There was a short period of opening up in the late s but that ended after the  Mecca Rebellion which made the religious establishment more powerful than ever. On top of that there is also fear of an alternative. Every time a regime is overthrown in the Arab World it is replaced either by a worse regime or a failed state. ,saudiarabia,cvf7im9,9,t5_2roj4
5224196,0,t1_cvfpfie,gtOn one of your comments you said t was reported his motorcade required a street to be closed maps of the event are available and the detour the pilgrims were forced to use was a proponent of this tragic event Yes because that is what was reported. I just googled and even the Saudi embassy commented on it.gtSaudi Arabia today denied that motorcades contributed to the trampling of the pilgrims in Mina yesterday.  In response to inquiries from Western media Ambassador Osama Ahmed Nugali manager of the Media Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cited the statement by Maj. Gen. Mansour AlTurki spokesman for the Ministry of Interior that motorcades of guests of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other dignitaries do not pass through the area in question and that these reports are unfounded.

Ive been to a campingelectronics kind of place to get a GPS navigator and the place was absolutely loaded with Kenwood radios.Anyway to answer OP Sorry no idea not actually a ham myself. In the CITC laws on amateur radio I see clauses about recognizing foreign licenses but only in conjunction with a local one as well as local licenses for saudis of course  No direct experience but the fans online seem to be super knowledgeable and a tightknit community. Might be a good idea to look into saudi amature radio forums if any. the CITC document from earlier says that customs will not clear equipment unless you have a valid license. No idea if the stores selling the equipment will check your credentials or what. Just in case Id wait until you have your local license before bringing anything over.

5932783,0,t3_3wknv2,Arapasta gave it a very good explanation there. But as someone who is close to the Royal Family I can easily say that the reformists are more abundant within the royal family than the conservatives thats for sure. However they are obliged to give a more conservative leeway due to pressure from the conservatives and the blow back from angering them meant historically a rise in terrorism activity in the country. The reformists are without a doubt more powerful than they have ever been in the country. Powerful enough that they control a lot of government institutions usually the ones that require competence because the conservatives have more tendency to be incompetent. The National Guard has become the military face of the reformists as well which is something the Royal family now has to balance in their reform calculations as well. No one knows what exactly will happen tomorrow or if the country is on the brink of a social and cultural shift but we are surely getting more open minded people injected into society who come from the younger age groups and the ones after our generation are going to be waaaaaaay more liberal than our generation as well. As far as I am concerned I am of the mind of dont rock the boat and let it reach its destination safely it already has to navigate through a storm and to try and push it into a tornado is not good for anybody. ,saudiarabia,cxxbgwf,3,t5_2roj4

7948835,0,t1_d49c0zo,Well from your history I see you are fond in reading and understanding about other religions and have really good grasp on their aspects. So I will try to recall what we have studied in the early and secondary education I am an old timer. Now I dont claim that As far as I recall there isnt any explicit mentioning of hate toward other religions but there is something I took under the religion studies called Al Wala Wal Bara Now the wiki I have linked to is in English and doesnt even touch the matter but the Arabic version of the wiki is sufficient. In essence the whole principle is based on being loyal to God and opposing who arent. This is based on a verse in Quran that is roughly translated to Immunity is granted those idolaters by God and his Apostle with whom you have a treaty. AtTawba verse Now that verse has been interpreted by many Islam schools and caused so much confusion on what exactly does it mean? does it mean we should dislike nonMuslims? Or we should actually oppose them? Or disavowal what the idolaters do? You can search for that verse and look it up.Now If I recall correctly what we are taught in school that we should disavowal the actions of non Muslims like drinking alcohol. But at my time most of the religion subject teachers were fanatics who either been taught the Jihadists ideologies due to Afghanistan war and the state of Israel and their occupation after Arabism failed to win the war on Israel. Again this was my case so it really varies based on the school. Anyhow you got those fanatics teachers who are all lets go rogue and start a Jihad teaching those young children. Most of the children didnt care cause they are children but like a snare it will eventually catch some little minds. And thus those children grow up on hating nonMuslims.Now this is the best way I tried to answer your question but the thing that many dont understand is the schools were used as a platform for hate by those fanatics indirectly which is in my opinion what causes people to misunderstand the situation. Now that is another bigger issue the government forcefully resolved after . Hope this gives you and idea.,saudiarabia,d49ivo0,2,t5_2roj4

8749237,0,t1_d6ykx9p,Really hard questions to answer but Ill try my best. Imma set my self as an example. Im . Its complicated. If you ask them in general youd find a high percentage. If you ask them as in face to face youd get a different result which I would guess roughly . If you want to be more specific Ill speak for my self I do believe in the laws taught in Quran. But I would say also that there should be exceptions for example someone stole cause they are hungry which happened to my grandfather when someone stole from his house some meat and my uncles caught him and were gonna hand him over but my grandfather talked to him and he let him go and gave him food. This is what I believe it should be. If the person is pushed into stealing for reason like food then it should be considered to help the person instead of punishment. If reason is just greed or so then yeah amputation is what he deserve. As for stoning I dont support it even though I believe in it. Mixed feelings I would say. Youll find different kinds of Saudis here. Some are still tied to the tradition and rejects westernization. Some want westernization cause it looks fun. Some want more open minded culture while keeping tradition. But hardly ever I saw someone support Islamic state beside the radical preachers. Yes. I my self do the  pillars of Islam would follow some rules. But I do enjoy a good drink. I dont mind going to parties although I hate loud sounds. Im open to dating.  I never met someone who believes in evolution yet in our country. I have a friend who believes in aliens though if that counts. So I would say not common. Yea we do have nonmulsims I would say the number is about correct. Not religious is kinda difficult here. People call me religious cause I practice the basics of Islam. But then my cousins would call me not religious cause Im not dedicated enough. In Islam you need to understand that as long you do the  pillars you are considered a Muslim. If you do not break them but still do other sins like drinking for example youll be punished accordingly in day of judgement to be cleansed before you go to heaven or so it is stated in the teaching. I dont know if this helps.,saudiarabia,d6zb60j,1,t5_2roj4

Have you done any work like a small project or something?If you seriously have exhausted physical jobs and you have perhaps a portfolio to show go register at Upwork.comThat thing is a bless. I really wanted to get a job but every placed I applied to just shrugged me off. I dont have a bachelor degree nor a master I just know how to code and make web apps.In September  I registered in Freelancer.com I really dont recommend that place its full of people whod work for like  peanuts an hour but I targeted the contests and won a couple. That built a portfolio for me to show.In around OctoberNovember I got on Upwork and took a job for hr hrs a day  hrs a week and holy shit. So far Ive made over k riyals just building up a web invoicing app. Technically speaking if I max  hrs a week Im getting paid .k riyals a month this is included the fees I have to pay in transfers to my bank acc.The pretty thing is that they send the money directly to your bank account and mine is ANB they only need your IBAN Upwork takes a  fee and strangely my bank account doesnt take any fees which is cool.My only worry is when the day comes and the bank would be like How are you getting this sort of  wo education?. Keep in mind that KSA doesnt really recognize freelancing laws or even think about however Upwork can send you proof of work if required.You have an IT Masters. That shit is serious.

It is unacceptable because everyone knows how it affects our community in a bad way not making anymore children.
