They will look better though in better fitting jeansyou look to be in pretty good shape and jeans that are tighter in the legs would be much better on you. Try Gap and experiment with different fits. Bring along a friend who will tell you the truth. ,GayRateMe,d7ryale,7,t5_3g7hb

If the poster is seeking advice on why he doesnt get a better response the wardrobe might be the missing piece of the puzzle.,GayRateMe,d9j9k71,1,t5_3g7hb
