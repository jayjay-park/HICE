Work with what RNG provides and what the storeslogin provide including buying FacelessDominators and a Starlight to get the basics for a  star team. Its all RNG and patience after the initial jump of playing for the first few days. I was stuck at one campaign level for a week while waiting for the next fusion so I could get past  and past tower .

First you get purple stone back when you use a hero as material for fusion Im not so sure about gold as I did not notice last time when I fused but I believe you get a portion of everything you invested back so dont worry about wasting resources leveling up  to . Get a full  lv  team is your first priority.. Baade and Gusta are considered two of the worst heroes so just use them as  for now and feed them to better heroes later.. Go for Faceless. You wont regret. Most raids and marauders have mages and in my experience to pass many stages and tower floors the trick is to kill some of the enemy asap which is Facelesss specialty.,IdleHeroes,dcpd82g,1,t5_3fzsh

10924984,0,t1_de6t4pw,Nice power laying around man! I feel like you are on the right path and considering your words my goal is to just decimate the enemy back line it sounds like you want a miki  dh added to your team. You will then be hitting hard quickly but not really able to sustain a longer fightwich are rare anyway. For the Groo i would pick Iceblink to go with him over emily and after that try to get the miki up as a replacement for mirage in the backline. Mainly to dodge alot and keep the AoE on the backline for longer aswell as keeping enemy assassins trying to hit he instead of the front. Eighter way both paths are very solid for you and when your done with the first set of  you will have very good swaping around potential with the following two. What it really comes down to is how you want your tank to act. Miki for that dodge and avoiding enemy getting their specials off and Groo for a less RNG tank. But if you go with Miki  DH i think you will be very happy with the results. ,IdleHeroes,de6u3or,1,t5_3fzsh

11076248,0,t3_5y5wcz,The game isnt really built to take advantage of the auras since you have to invest so many resources into getting powerful heroes and those resources have to be of their color.

11450963,0,t1_dft1q1r,HG at  star is tons better than DS at  or even . While you are working towards another Dant dont overlook Balrog. He has great survivability for maraudersbosses which will allow your DoT to pile up. If you leave him at  star you can feed him to Dant later on. I actually prefer Balrog over HG at  star even when using a healer for Trialsmaraudersbosses since the stun basically doesnt work in anything but Trials.I wouldnt be overly worried by the lack of a fire hero unless you feel that the rainbow bonus is that important. With the addition of all the new team bonuses there are other options to try for.Having a  star tank will help you more than a  star Mirage. Mirage especially when running an assassin team will be a big boon later on so he can be a situational hero worth keeping around.I suggest you keep a healer around for trialsmaraudersbosses they can make the difference between going to the end or dying off before the finish line.You might want to hold off on OD just yet he becomes pretty important when you start hitting the tower levels of all Gerkes and Disciples.,IdleHeroes,dftyhai,2,t5_3fzsh
