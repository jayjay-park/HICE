Gallstones that cause symptoms or complications are usually treated with gallbladder surgery or nonsurgical procedures that dissolve or fragment the stones.

If you do a diet and lose weight then go back to the old way youll gain back the weight with or without exercise. Gradual change is best or if you do choose to flip overnight do something you can maintain. Choose foods you actually enjoy eating that are healthy and stick to those and dont have a list of foods you cant have. One thing that has helped for me while quitting soda was that I said I can have a soda if I want but I dont want to. I want to be healthy instead. Keep that in mind when times get rough as they inevitably will.Good luck!,HealthyFood,csxt6tb,2,t5_2rhbm

8346231,0,t3_4ttssg,Its so easy to get stuck in a rut when you are short on time.Maybe adding some variety might help  corn sweet potato capsicumbell pepper squash zucchinicourgette purple carrots instead of orange cauliflower brussels sprouts asparagus etc.  They can all be steamed or boiled which sounds like your preferred method.Also try roasting veg with a little olive or coconut oil and some spices when you have time again for variety.  You can do a bulk lot and reheat them the next night.Another idea might be a salad.  Then you could incorporate some more variety with which leaves you use and other salad items eg tomato snow peas cabbage etc that you might not steam.  It would probably take less time than steaming and you can do a few days worth in one hit.  Mix it up with different dressings adding cheese seeds or nuts.Do you have a slow cooker?
