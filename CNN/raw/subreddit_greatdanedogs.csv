After a few days both understand if they want to go outdoor make the bell make noise so mom will open the door. Makes it a lot easier but often he just want to go out to play or chase after deer or coyotes.I train for tricks x a day for about  minutes big session do not work well with lazy dane or bull terrier haha,greatdanedogs,cxeo0wd,1,t5_2y2nl

Dont sound angry just hurt. they do understand that. Once they start to understand the yelp you can use of if they bump into people hit them with their paws etc. Im disabled and this is how I teach my service dogs to be super careful not to hurt me. we can still play and roughhouse but they are careful. Its wonderful. ,greatdanedogs,dbqbo4a,4,t5_2y2nl
