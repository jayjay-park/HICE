699928,0,t3_225sxm,i much prefer to low serve especially against the male opponent so that is my default serve. i normally plan what serve i will use as soon as the previous point has finished so i will tell my partner usually before i even have the shuttle in my hand.i normally make sure that i go to pick up the shuttle from the front of the court or maybe i go forward and steady the net cord if it is moving.  i then whisper flick serve or something to my partner as i return to my service position while i have my back turned to the opposition.i only use it rarely and normally only against the female player once ive figure out her game a bit.  as others have said theres no point deciding to do a different serve without knowing why youre going to do it.,badminton,cgju1iq,3,t5_2r6dm
863606,0,t3_22gyp5,Im  days too late to reply this but thought Id give my opinion. I have both the Voltric ZF and NZS. I got the UG ZF and the UG NZS. I use the ZF for singles and NZS for doubles but if I have to choose at gun point I go with ZF.I used the Voltric  for quite a long time before trying out both. Personally the NZS feels the closest to the V the weight and repulsion felt very similiar but better. Its heavy but it gives a nice kick to hard hits and allows the great amount of power if you wanna play offensive especially for doubles.However ZF is my new main racquet. The weight seemed to be more emphasized on the head than the NZS and the thinner shaft makes it better for quick swings and defensive plays. The difference in weight balance takes getting used to if youve been using a more balance or headlight racquets but if youre already a poweroriented players youll be fine. Oh! ZF also has a wider head than the NZS thus a wider sweet spot in hits.One thing I do have to point out personally I feel like NZS has a better BANG when it comes to smashes  not saying ZF is a slouch its definitely not  but when you hit that shuttle perfectly the NZS just thunders. Id say its a matter of preference and what it feels like in your hands. the ZF just feels quicker and more responsive the NZS is mainly for offense and heavy hits.,badminton,ch2g495,2,t5_2r6dm

1779534,0,t3_2eujda,after trying a few grips i like to play with the yonex supergrap. its a solid pretty tacky overgrip that can be found almost anywhere you buy badminton stuff. other grips ive tried include the wilson pro overgrip which is alright but doesnt feel as good as the supergrap. ive tried some babolat grip from citi sports or something that was nice and squishy but very expensive  for !!. and some RKEP grip that was really hard and got slick with sweat. ,badminton,ck3gqro,1,t5_2r6dm

6768496,0,t3_48g1rw,i have to say im the sort of guy that will press the first point  i dont especially like seeing people get hit even if they are being obnoxoius but unfortunately you cant even guarantee wholl come off worse in a collision. youd feel like shit if your best friend snapped a  racket or rolled his ankle and ended up in hospital because some beginners were in the wrong place at the wrong time.on the second point if another shuttle lands on my court  times one of us will call a let unless play is focused in a totally different area and the rally feels close to the finish even then the expected losers often take the opportunity to call a let rather than lose the point  cynical but happens all the time. ive been known to sneak on another court and scoop the shuttle up quickly but only when its clear that i wont be getting in the way.,badminton,d0jhmka,1,t5_2r6dm

9608902,0,t3_5cldt1,The first few shots of a rally are all about who can gain control. Except for the occasional surprise it is unlikely that a player at any level will be able to put their opponent under pressure with a serve so the goal of the serve should be to give you the best chance of taking control with your next shot. These days particularly in mens singles players are very good at attacking with their overhead shots and then following up well to continue their attack so a high serve will likely mean you start the rally defending. To avoid this problem people serve short and rely on very good movement to gain control of a rally. Since the backhand is more effective for short services it is more common to serve low and backhand. This pattern is almost always what happens in mens singles at a good level and getting more popular in womens singles too. Whether you should serve high or low depends on your strengthsweaknesses and those of your opponent  dont just serve low and backhand because that is what other people do. In a match start off with whichever you feel most confident doing and stick with it as long as it works change if you find yourself often behind in the rally after your serve. I think this summarises the main points but if theres anything else Ill be happy to answer!,badminton,d9xhryb,21,t5_2r6dm

As long as you dont get a crappy knockoff you should be fine. Looking at the page again that particular racket doesnt come with a covercase and from that site isnt in stock at the moment so if thats a problem you could try to find something similar.For shoes... there really arent so many variables. As with all shoes different brands will fit differently  some fit quite bigsmall some are more narrow etc so thats probably worth looking into. But yeah anything above  or so thats marketed as an indoor court shoe  squash volleyball or badminton  should do the trick,badminton,dazrl91,1,t5_2r6dm

11457727,0,t1_dfuf438,ronsonc spotted what many havent  a very late rearcourt backhand clear where the shuttle is further away from the net than you are requires the thumb on bevel . On most backhand clears contactable at a good height lots of time and with shuttle the same distance from the net as you or closer you want your thumb to be on bevel . On shots where the shuttle is closer to the net than you and you cant contact it at a good reaching up height then bevel  is where your thumb is at. This could be because the shuttle is far in front of you like a drive battle. These arent likely to be the case in the rearcourt anyway unless you like to hog the back lines in doubles  its more he case when people drive at you from the midcourt. If someone gives you the chance to play a backhand well in front of you and with good height then basically you could have played the roundthehead shot which is preferred. The reason is to do with where your racquet face is pointing. With  the racquet points to the opponents rearcourt corner when the shuttle is contacted level with you same distance from the net as you. If you use  you point completely out of the court and will slice it or have to contort your wristbody to hit it straight i.e no power. Crosscourt shots will be very awkward if not impossible to execute well. If the shuttle goes behind you further away from the net than you then bevel  gets the same problems with bevel  before  with bevel  the racquet face again points out of the court. In this case you need to rotate the grip even further to bevel  to get the racquet face to point straight at contact. This means you cant use wrist supination as effectively but thats your fault for being late the the shuttle  you have to have extremely good technique to play a full backhand clear from the late backhand position.  Hope you understand why the bevels move for a backhand now!       ,badminton,dfuq4g3,1,t5_2r6dm
