8134804,0,t3_4qkmb2,Yeah  this is basically the one feature Im missing from the app to make it my main app of choice. Just a simple folder structure. ,bearapp,d4ufc3a,1,t5_3eqxu
8444345,0,t1_d5x2208,Ah I see. It worked for photos. But PDFs it shows that there are no notes to connect to,bearapp,d5x2xme,1,t5_3eqxu
9702932,0,t3_5dyqic,I dont want to shoot down your idea but I like the way the bear app organizes things now. Have you tried using the hashtag feature? You should dig into the welcome info or their website more more information. Its one of the quickest ways to organize and I dont want the Bear app to become another Evernote because they are doing things right. Ive been looking for the app for years and its finally here! Ive already subscribed for a year and cant wait to see the improvements and customizations they make in their own way to the app. ,bearapp,da93ej8,4,t5_3eqxu

10606144,0,t3_5rsnb6,HiI think this is how Apple Notes behave but I dont know if what everyone expect from lists. Well think about it.,bearapp,dd9xxz5,1,t5_3eqxu
10697315,0,t1_ddj6lwy,Synching the whole backup can result in a terrible sync. Imagine having GB of notes  attachments and have to sync the whole thing each time a device modify a note.Reasoning with a file for each note works but we have to reparse each file every time it changes and also resync and import the attachments even when they are not changed which make the sync way less faster.,bearapp,ddjcjz7,1,t5_3eqxu
11083415,0,t3_5y4jrs,One simple way to mimic dividers would be to prefix tags with a letter or character. You can get these fake groups of tags sorted by choosing the prefix characters you use appropriately.For example I have a set of multiword top of mind tags that look like  Action   WaitingFor  !Inbox  KeyInformation  Template   Journal   These tags appear at the very top of my list of tags because the character  is sorted before any numbers or letters. And the !Inbox is at the very top because it has the leading !So you could also have a p ... and a w ... set of tags to separate personal and work projects.,bearapp,deoan3d,1,t5_3eqxu

11362337,0,t3_6231jq,Hiplease check if you have free space on iCloud. Eventually try to give it some more time images usually take sometimes to be uploaded depending to your internet connection.,bearapp,dfjwe5y,1,t5_3eqxu
11364367,0,t1_dfjw3hk, Hmmmm. Okay. Unless were not understanding one another I think Im going to have to respectfully disagree. Maybe Im weird but I cant think of a single time Ive looked at the style status buttons in a rich text editor to know if something is formatted. I just look at the text. If its bold I know its bold. Same for italic. Since Bear does visual styling its totally obvious when something is bolditalic. Plus theres the added indication from the markup so not only do you have the emboldened visual style but you also have the markupshowing its bold. So I see absolutely no reason why it would be difficult for a user to know if theyre in bold mode. So I guess we just see things differently. But thanks for letting me know this isnt viewed as a bug by yall and therefore it wont be fixed. Ima think about this but this may be a dealbreaker for me and I may need to move back to Writer and MultiMarkdown Composer which handles this in a standard way. I write way too much to be having to arrow right after every bolditalic style I use. Personally I would MUCH rather see the caret put between the markup with a temporary space than an uneditable HR. The way things are now is suuuuper confusing and frankly a PitA. Oh that makes perfect sense. For some reason I thought this was programmingrelated.,bearapp,dfk4o4e,1,t5_3eqxu
