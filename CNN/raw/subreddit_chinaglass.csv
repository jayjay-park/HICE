3505424,0,t3_30f0in,I have this piece from them and it functions great. It took a couple weeks to get here but it was  shipped from China and its thicker than I expected it to be.

4812327,0,t1_ct2arsz,I know its reviving an old thread but I finally took a good look at a quantum egg a couple weeks ago and its definitely higher quality than the Chinese stuff. The build feels solid and the work looks a lot more precise. The barrel perc thing at the bottom looks more like it was made by Mobius than in China. That said I still havent found out much about the company. I just assume theyre not Chinese from the fact I pretty much have only seen higher end shops carry their glass never in the lower end mostly Chinese shops. I think it would be worth the  price tag.Just thought you might be interested since eggs seem to be your thing.,chinaglass,cu14ttd,1,t5_37k43

6771956,0,t3_48godw,Here is why. Everybody shut down for New years for several weeks but they dont close their shop because they still can take orders. But now they are running behind and DHgate puts pressure on then to ship within a given time or they get penalized. So they buy a few days by giving you a bullshit tracking number because your item might not have even been made when you bought it a couple weeks ago. Youll get your item once it ships this week it will likely have a different tracking number in the end. Happens every year for the past decade Ive ordered shit from Hong Kong and China.,chinaglass,d0jvspn,2,t5_37k43
