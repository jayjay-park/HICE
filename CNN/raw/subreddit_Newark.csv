4674810,0,t3_3evjq4,FWIW this isnt a problem with Newark just cab companies in NJ in general. The lack of regulation is a total joke. I once was forced to share a ride with a stranger from Princeton Junction to downtown Princeton same route to the same drop off place. He tried to charge us  separately for the  mile trip. But it was am so there was no other option. Fuck the cab companies. ,Newark,ctjt6jb,1,t5_2rc7a

4995895,0,t3_3jcznf,I hope this works but my guess is most people in Newark are homeless because they cant abide by rules regarding drug use in group housing or they are mentally ill and too hard to manage in group housing.  I do hope it helps people or gives them better access to psychiatric care.,Newark,cuo6wn3,7,t5_2rc7a

6389893,0,t3_436iaz,There arent too many bad areas of East RutherfordRutherfordCarlstadtLyndhurst. There also isnt much to do in those towns either. Over where you are staying there are some... gentlemens clubs if thats your thing. Rutherford is a dry town all restaurants are BYOB but has some truly excellent restaurants. You can also buy liquor at a couple of good stores in town Rutherford Wine Shop Masons Cellar.A new sportsbeer bar just opened up in East Rutherford. We went for dinner a few weeks ago. Service was really slow but the food was solid. Nice tap list with a ton of local beers. For dessert I had their peanut butter cheesecake with a Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Heaven.Newark is worth traveling to if you have the time. Amazing diversity of food and a lot of decent areas. Museum  there is quite good. Its generally recommended to stay in the area called Ironbound be sure to get Portuguese food and around the Prudential Center but thats slowly changing. ,Newark,czfyqoq,3,t5_2rc7a

7399685,0,t1_d2fq5xx,See thats what I dont like. AUTOMATICALLY I dont like black people because I have a different perspective on how policies and economics should be run. Is this the only response Baraka supporters can say to someone who criticizes them ? Oh you dont like Ras you must be a racist. I liked Shavar Jefferies and he was black. Booker was cool until I learned that he was a sellout. At least Sharpe loved this city but again he was a ghetto politician. What kind of elected public servant calls his opponent a white fag and thats just ONE example. What kind of argument do you have against me when you dont know me? Its ridiculous. The guys and gals in this forum could vouche for me from previous conversations. Im born and raised in Newark bro my best friends are black Ive prayed alongside black people in mosques and churches. Ive been welcomed into black homes and Ive welcomed black people into my home. Dont you dare say that to me without knowing me.As for the poor. A city that is broke and has no money has no way of supporting its citizens. Projects CLEARLY have worked right ?! WRONG DUMBASS. Housing Projects were failed projects its a matter of just looking at the numbers the statistics. Put housing projects into a decent area and it goes to shit. Period. WHY WOULD YOU EVER WANT MORE ? You have to understand  with complete objectivity  if there are too many people that just take from the system and dont contribute than how can a city possibly grow progress better itself ?!? Im a democrat voted for Obama and voting for Sanders but you cant blindly follow a partisanpartycandidate line. There are other ways of addressing the poor than just throwing money at them.Come with me debating policies not calling me a racist. Thats an argument for the smallminded.,Newark,d2jan4w,2,t5_2rc7a

However I feel like they are taking into account all the amenities the development brings plus being relatively close to  light rail stations Penn and Broad Street Station. Hopefully this does well and NJPAC tower as they can start to truly prove the type of market downtown has.,Newark,dbqatr5,1,t5_2rc7a
