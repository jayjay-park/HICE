7365265,0,t3_4g71r9,Its always hard to imagine the result of combining elements of different inspo pictures but I think what youve got will work well together once you get a feel for styling the clothes and the hair at the same time. I definitely think the first style is a better choice for the type of shirts that you linked and I think the end result will be something like a punkierandrogynous greaser look. It sounds cool!One thing to note is that the first style has a lot of length on the top with very clean sides so its actually a cut that could offer you a lot of flexibility. If you were to style it forward it would give a similar feel to the model in the second shirt picture you linked. Its easy to overthink all of this I totally know! but in the end you just have to try things out together. Give it a shot see what works see what doesnt.

7375496,0,t3_4gczpf,Finally left the house and drove to Harrisonburg to get the HAMSTERBABY yesterday! There were two girls and one boy left and I chose the blackandtan female because she was much less skittish than her sister. I was super tempted though I love the reverse eyeliner on the darker ones So I brought her home and while the trip landed me in bed with massive pain in my legs and arms for the rest of the day she jumped in her wheel about a halfhour after we got home and RAN NONSTOP for FIVE HOURS. Then she took a little nap. THEN SHE RAN SOME MORE. I finally took the wheel out around midnight so both she and I could get some sleep. But I woke up around am and heard her running in the UFO wheel. WTF hamsterbaby. SLEEP.Oh weve settled on Missy for her name. Im not sure if shes named after the Mistress from Doctor Who or Missy Elliott yet but considering shes already peed on me Im gonna guess its the former. Mona Lisa NEVER peed on me. I was a little more put out by this than I expected.She also hasnt drunk from her water bottle  which isnt too worrisome yet because shes getting fluids from that cucumber  and she built an open nest not one in either of the TWO houses Ive provided for her so Im going to switch some stuff around and just keep an eye on her today to make sure she knows how to hamster properly.If I can get those DAMN bookcases built today I may even move her into the media room for a few days before Grandmother gets here just so she can get on a good sleeping schedule. My room has the window completely blocked off and hamsters need natural sunlight to set their internal clocks. So I need to get to work.  ,fringefashion,d2gjjhq,2,t5_33m31

So Ive decided to use the birthday money my Aunt sent me to get started on the Battle Vest Im making! I have patches and pins saved and a shitton of ideas. But what I need help with is picking out the vest itself! What do you fine ladies and gentlemen prefer of these to go with my strega punk style?More grey than black but I like the hood and the price.Not Denim at all but again it has a hood and a decent price!I love the ragged look and big collar but the price and made in China tag makes me unsure.I love the length of this and I can cut off the sleeves but the collar is kind of tiny and the buttons will need to be replaced. Not to mention its a bit more than I want to spend on something Im gonna heavily modify.This ones a really nice dark black and I like the lines. But its honestly pretty plain beyond that.Im trying really hard to not spend a lot on the vest itself around  at most but if anyone can recommend more options or pick something from the list Id really appreciate the help!,fringefashion,d7didpo,3,t5_33m31

I tend to ignore the fact that dressing for sexuality can be a form of personal empowerment. I will admit that I was initially a little grumpy about the tone of LaVeys comments but I love how youve interpreted those comments to make a quite inclusive album given the very female theme.,fringefashion,d80mt0q,2,t5_33m31

9706558,0,t3_5e3pr2,My family had Early Thanksgiving this weekend so yay thats over. Except we found out my mom cant have butter at all not even after its been bakedcooked...sigh. Well have to revamp all the recipes AGAIN. And just when we finally figured out the glutenfreelowdairy green bean casserole and apple pie...FUN FACT Coconut milk can totally sub for evaporated milk in pumpkin pie. Except my sister doesnt like coconut. So next time were gonna try lactaid.ANYWAY.Black Friday. Whos ready? I already spent my money alloted for Small Business Saturday and finally got a plushie from this Esty seller Been trying to get my hands on one of her creations for three years! But right now for Black Friday Im trawling all my favorite stores making wish lists and trying to figure out what I want what Ill actually USE and what price is actually going to mean its decently on actual sale rather than an false markdown. EDIT Im really debating getting this coat even though I rarely get to use the coats I already own. Why? Well for one thing I obsessed over a similar Victorias Secret coat for YEARS and never got it  not only could I not afford it I lived in Alabama and Florida and it was entirely impractical and that was besides only having a center row of button closures. It was more a car coat than anything. But this coat is doublebreasted and fitandflare instead of straightcut so its much more suited to my body shape than the VS coat ever was. And right now while Im picturing wearing this with future bubblegoth or lolitatype fits even if I gave all my current aesthetics up completely and went back to that slightlyleftofnormal style that defined my college and working years this would still suit me. People have a lot of different criteria for investment pieces and this coat is checking a lot of my personal boxes. I may not get to wear it more than once or twice a year in my current situation but Im fairly certain I will still love this coat a decade from now.Im also glad its NOT made of wool  wool makes me itchy.,fringefashion,da9ji2g,3,t5_33m31

A few brands actually make a special kind of glue to keep them held up despite being so baggy. Its like a gluestick for your legs.,fringefashion,damle4d,1,t5_33m31

9932876,0,t3_5hpsne,Im suddenly remembering why I dont like winter. I moved all my and my girlfriends fringier clothes to my girlfriends sisters room last year because hey shes not home we could use the space and she doesnt mind a couple extra racks hanging around her room for her clothes either which works great except for two things. . I have to get dressed to go across the hall and get dressed so theres a bit more planning involved. And the more important one . Her heat doesnt work. So when its  degrees outside with a  chance of snow her room drops down to according to the thermostat  degrees which is too damn cold for inside the house. And really too damn cold for trying on clothes for the closet clean out or changing out of your nice warm clothes into some clothes that feel like they should belong to Elsa.Ive currently got our portable heater in there warming the place up a bit hopefully so I can not freeze to death while putting my new stuff away. If that works Im just gonna keep it in there and turn it on before I need to do anything in there.,fringefashion,db2a1q3,3,t5_33m31

10331885,0,t3_5nw8tp,I struggle with the whole seasonal changeover every single time. Its like I forget that the heatcold will end eventually end and Ill get stuck for a bit LOLIn summer I aim for thinner lighter natural fibers like linen and cotton. Ill do silk in summer if it is gauzy tissue thin stuff because if it is a thick silk it becomes an insulating layer. Texas heat makes me sweat like a buffalo so I like fabrics that let the heat out. All that sweat and Texas dirt means that I generally go for dingy dirty colors like tans and greys and greige and such so it doesnt show stains as much.I tend towards a lot of dystopian stuff and asymmetry the more shredded andor asymmetric it is the better and it has taken me a while to build up a semiacceptable summer wardrobe of tops. I still so a lot of jeans during summer I just switch to lighterthinner ones in summer. Once it starts hitting F around C with heat indexhumidex over C Ill do shorts but I dont like them because they seem harder to style. Of course once its F I kind of dont give a shit what I look like I just dont want to die of heatstroke LOL. My big old calf tattoo does help me feel a little less normcore in shorts as does my lack of a tan LOLI dont know how to link to a comment thread on here sorry but heres a copypaste of a comment I posted to this Dystopian post apocalyptic wasteland future fashion dark fashion apocalypse cyberpunk futuristic steampunk goth cybergoth deconstructed demobaza  urban style ninja goth ninja Now we all know that these are actually all different and distinct styles but they all get lumped together in pinterest sometimes,fringefashion,dcf6dfi,5,t5_33m31
