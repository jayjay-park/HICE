9493371,0,t1_d9j48vq,Ill be honest with you Soon means valve time. Every time we mention soon it means we are preparing to launchrelease then something normally comes up or we have to do a huge change and the time gets pushed back for the original plan. But this is all to give you guys the best and most stable mod possible. You shouldnt have to design your mods on top of a shotty mod framework  So sometimes Soon could mean this week in a few days or a month or more out. Depending on our workloadfreetime.,VeniceUnleashed,d9j9ex4,3,t5_33moq
