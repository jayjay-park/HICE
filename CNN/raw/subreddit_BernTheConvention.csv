7522093,0,t3_4icx7l,Came here from SFP. Keep posting there about this if you dont get up voted enough to move the post up.   There are a lot trolls on that site a lot.  They down vote and post trivial posts to move important posts down so they get lost. Keep posting people will see it.  Maybe try to contact the mods.  They are generally swamped trying to tame the trolls but they seem ok and are eager to encourage activism. ,BernTheConvention,d2x8431,17,t5_3eh6c

7554984,0,t1_d30xnms,If hundreds of thousands of people turn out then the practical reality is that people will tent out and sleep in their cars. Itll just be so many people that will just end up unavoidable If the city wants it or not. There are massive parking lots around the convention center and a massive park.I hope someone in the Sanders calls on a million people march to this event. That is a totally doable number.

7605243,0,t3_4jgh71,Imperative that you have a way to communicate your suspicions and findings with others on the spot. It might also be useful to have a contact at some central location HQ  a lawyer type  and attorneys among you as well. I think the ACLU has task forces or lawyers available for this. But you are so right  they will use agents provocateurs to discredit the effort to discredit Bernie to justify the crackdown to dissuade others from joining  going  being active in the future etc. etc. Plus there is guaranteed media coverage for disruptors but NOT for the peaceful so if even ONE person can be found being disruptive it counts against all no matter how many thousands were not.I cant go myself health but my heart is with you.,BernTheConvention,d36od95,10,t5_3eh6c

7652586,0,t1_d3by0kf,Is there information about what to do if you are being threatened with arrest or are actually arrested? Are there certain things people should say or do? What about being detained vs. being arraigned? Informed protestors that know how to handle being arrested may have more confidence about what they are doing. I remember a few years ago a friends husband was protesting and he had lawyers phone numbers written on his arms in marker so he could contact them if his phone was taken.,BernTheConvention,d3c21he,3,t5_3eh6c

Are there  or so pet projects that I would love to see tacked onto Sanders platform? Yes definitely.
