3251475,0,t3_2vmra0,A former friend of mine is in VemmaVerve Whatever its called from here on Ill call it VV. My friend Lets call him George left his lucrative catering business because a  year old college drop out introduced him to it at a catering conference. George threw everything he had into VV. Tried to convince me to jump on this ship before it sailed. His wife left him his two college aged daughters wont go near him because everytime they did he wanted them to bring him on campus and pitch to their sorority and introduce them to fraternities so he can pitch VV.Despite making upwards of K every month with his catering company he thought earning  a month with VV was successful and all he needed was a few more subscribers then hell be able to retire.George cut himself off from all his old friends who tried to tell him this wasnt working and he was being silly. He quoted some ridiculous motivational quotes and things like dont be haters. George gave his wife the house in the divorce settlement because next month thats when the big money is going to come in. He now lives in a one bedroom short term let apartment. His daughters deleted him on Facebook because he kept messaging their friends with VV offers and how it would help their nutrition.George was eventually got so much business at VV that they gave him a MercedesBenz. Wow we all thought.. It wasnt a scam except they take the lease payment from his monthly check.What have I got against VV it has turned my friend into a delusional idiot.,Vemma,coz0wdm,3,t5_2uikd
3779097,0,t1_cmsabjs,And you did not understand what he stated. He said that there were studies which provide the evidence for cigarettes to not be dangerous. This is not true ofcause. Because cigarettes are a danger this is the reason he chose that example. Once upon a time there were studies which made people think smoking is safe big studies by big companies. Today we know that claiming smoking is safe is bullshit. He chose that example to show that studies dont necessarily provide you with truth.,Vemma,cqn1ltj,0,t5_2uikd
