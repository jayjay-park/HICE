3246677,0,t3_2x9yxi,First good luck with your plan to continue climbing throughout your pregnancy  I know a couple of women who managed it... I didnt  I climbed  times a week too generally twice inside once out. I had the easiest pregnancy imaginable but I felt off balance from about  weeks and then my pelvis separated ugh really painful to me. I couldnt climb how I wanted to and so I stopped. Id still head out with everyone but towards the end there I would feel more miserable than happy watching my friends climb wanting to try a new route or whatever knowing that if I wasnt pregnant I would smash it plus being out on a crag somewhere at  weeks pregnant needing to pee every  mins put me in a bit of a sour mood  . Im pregnant with my second and havent climbed much since then I miss it soooo much its not funny. We moved just after I gave birth the first time so we lost our climbing support crew amp havent figured out how to head out the two of us plus toddler. Were determined to just start bouldering more often once  is here  we enjoy the additional problem solving that comes with bouldering and are hoping that managing small children will be easier when youre not having to belay.tldr I didnt manage to continue climbing throughout pregnancy but plenty of women do if youre experienced amp have skilled amp understanding friends go for it!!!,fitpregnancy,coyiyk8,2,t5_372t2
3250855,0,t3_2xcp92,Id been trying to lose a bit of weight right before pregnancy and was on a diet where I restricted carbs even the delicious fruit and starchy veg ones and ate tons of protein and green veggies. When I got my BFP I was like well that diet seems really unhealthy now. I was so excited that the Canada Food Guide recommended  servings of grains. Mmmm pasta. My first trimester goals were really to shove  servings of fruits and vegetables in me. When I start to try to get all the food groups in the recommended amounts I would get full and nauseous and feel terrible. Later I read that in the st trimester dairy and iron arent as important and if you cant eat dont make yourself miserable so getting all the recommended macros is going to be my goal in the next month...Also not binging on donuts once Im no longer hiding the fact that Im pregnant from work. Now that my appetite is returned I want all the donuts and gummi bears and bagels. ,fitpregnancy,coyyk9r,2,t5_372t2

Hopefully the band will mean I can resume walking to work instead of resorting to the car every day. Fingers crossed!,fitpregnancy,cu2iall,2,t5_372t2

8627363,0,t3_4vtc1a,I would say I started the nausea around  weeks myself which was just another clue as to something was not right. That was about when I found out I was pregnant and had just began training for a half marathon for this fall. I had days where fatigue and nausea hit me like a bus and I could just not do a thing. However on the days I woke up feeling alright I would try to get out and just accomplish a short  mi run. If I started feeling sick I walked until I was okay. Ive been able to complete about a half dozen k races among my own runs since finding out I was pregnant and am starting to feel a lot better. If you must eat something small and just keep drinking your water. ,fitpregnancy,d6k0vo5,1,t5_372t2
9014305,0,t3_53opzj,I know several women who had to stop running during the first trimester and were able to ease back into it in the second tri. The biggest thing Ive learned about running while pregnant I ran my whole first pregnancy and Im now  weeks with  and still plodding away is listen to your body! It will definitely tell you if you need to slow down or stop! ,fitpregnancy,d7vdnur,5,t5_372t2
9804417,0,t1_dalbufa,Yeah I really suffered from that with my first pregnancy. I already have really loose joints and the relaxin made it impossible to do anything more than walk. I was really out of shape though so I am quite curious to see the difference in my pregnancies. I had SPD and sciatica on top of that.,fitpregnancy,dallsug,2,t5_372t2
9986046,0,t3_5igiqm,If you can afford to buy a few more pairs of leggings in a much larger size. I just recently broke down at  weeks and bought maternity leggings because I was sick of my love handles spilling out of my normal pants and leggings. Theyre a bit loose right now but Ill grow into them and will probably want to wear them well after the baby is here because of how comfortable they are. ,fitpregnancy,db97kdn,2,t5_372t2
