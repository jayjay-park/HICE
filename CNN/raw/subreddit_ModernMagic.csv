38723,0,t3_1ufew2,I see you want devotion but I played against a really cool mono black at a GPT the other day. The decks main focus is to force discard and and use edicts to destroy your opponent before killing them with Phyrexian Crusader. non of my games saw this but I watched him play my friend in the semis and he had discard sitting on a scepter to hit her before her mainphase each turn.

49013,0,t3_1uafmv,I agree that you could use some more removal while you set up your board. Melira Pod doesnt need much removal cause they dont play fair. Youre not really trying to do unfair things just toolbox up a bunch of good creatures. I forsee Batterskull Wurmcoil presenting problems. Also I think Blood Artist is a little weak here.

202581,0,t1_cf1b7r8,There is nothing. Wed play Aetherling or something similar if we just wanted to win the game outright but thats not the purpose of Wurmcoil. As a nonTron player you already recognize its power by seeing first hand how difficult it is to regain the upper hand once your opponent resolves one especially if youre playing a creature deck.  The only thing close to comparable might be Frost Titan but that is still so so so much worse. It requires double blue and cant be tutored with Trinket Mage. Im sorry youre taking an interest in this deck the week after the price spike. Maybe Remand will be in the event deck to make up for it.,ModernMagic,cf1imt7,2,t5_2xs5t
209653,0,t1_cf270l8,BGx would only have problems playing Bitterblossom if Deathrite were to be banned alongside the unban. Also they might have to cut down to BG to really support it without hurting themselves too much. In between Scavenging Ooze and Deathrite Bitterblossom wouldnt kill them. Obviously you have to side accordingly in the matchups where every last bit of health matters but it would make some matchups even better and provide some pretty insane card advantage.BW Tokens could get better but I doubt it would become Tier . It still just isnt as good as the top tier decks and Im not sure its enough.You are largely overestimating how good Faeries would be. Yes Bitterblossom is a big card but it would not push the deck over the top. And yes actually the existence of Abrupt Decay as well as other better cards that currently exist would make Faeries much worse. That said having a new tempo deck in the format would be awesome.,ModernMagic,cf2bnel,3,t5_2xs5t
216536,0,t3_1w80f8,Your goal is to assemble Tron as efficiently as possible stick a threat and win.  Heres a few things to keep in mind on the early turns. Always play Tron lands first.  Lets say your hand is Mine Grove x Stirrings Karn x Chromatic Star.  It might seem reasonable to Grove gt Stirrings turn  but thats never the correct line  always Tron gt mana rock gt T Stirrings.  You dont need to Stirrings turn  since youve played a land and you have a chance to pull a Tron land on the draw step.  Play the Grove if you whiff and Stirrings again.  If you do happen to pull a second Tron land off the top you now have saved a Stirrings to find a threat instead of a land.  . Play Tower last.  The reason you do this is to give you the most options if youre a turn behind on Tron  youll often end turn three with a single untapped Tron land having played it after burning the other two on fetch.  Playing Tower last lets you play an OStone turn three or the option to play and crack a Map immediately for another land  things you could not do with two mana.  . Dont be stingy with the mana rocks.  You want to crack them when you can  cycling through your deck is of utmost importance.  You need to find your threats and lands and find them fast.  The more cards you see the better your chances are.  Even if you have the Grove burn the rock unless youre saving it for a Slaughter Games or something.  The one other case where I would save a rock is if its postboard against a deck that you know runs Stony SilenceBlood Moon you have a Natures Claim in hand AND no other green source.  You will get stuck not having colored mana with this deck at times.  Fact of life.  Its up to you and the situation to determine if burning your last green source with no card to play is your only to win.  . Against Tectonic Edge.  Your best plan against Tec Edge is to sit on three Tron lands and brick it until you can Karn it or have a full set of Tron in hand to replace what they kill.  No matter what fourth land you play Tec Edge breaks Tron which will set you back farther than not playing a Grove or a duplicate Tron land.  Of course if your opponent played a Tec Edge early they are likely thin on land  consider that when choosing Karn targets and take their more important colored sources before the Tec Edge.  Also consider that almost every opponent will Tec Edge a Tower so you can gamble on that if youre feeling lucky and have an extra one in hand.  Further consider than Karning a Tec Edge is usually not the right play and this deck runs just fine on one set of Tron lands.  . Against Ghost Quarter.  Hope they dont draw a lot of these.  GQ is pretty good.  . Against Stony Silence.  Crack your mana rocks early and often. Crack them in response to the Stony Silence to float a green for the Claim if you have it or crack it for green and hope to pull a Claim on the cycle.  Its not doing you any good as a onemana artifact with no abilities might as well turn it into a card in hand.  Turn  Expedition Map gets bricked by Stony Silence if youre on the draw so deprioritize that if youre postboard on the draw against a deck with white mana  use other fetch or play mana rocks first.  . Against Blood Moon.  Same tactics as Stony Silence except youre more likely to have Tron already.  Float mana for an OStone activation if youre so fortunate as to have one on the board and five mana to blow it.  ,ModernMagic,cf33w9l,2,t5_2xs5t

893120,0,t1_ch5sds8,Yeah UB has a lot more hard removal that kills more things than UWR. However the truth is that when the metagame shifts towards A. combo decks and B. Many creatures that can be killed with a bolt. That hard removal becomes less useful. Id rather just have bolts if im going to be dealing with many sub  toughness threats. Same reason why abrupt decay sure a Destroy target non artifact creature. Effect for  mana is good but  damage to target creature or player is super diverse and it can remove planeswalkers burn players down which is sometimes the UWR control plan anyway to bolt  snap bolt  helix someone down And UWB or URB doesnt have quite the same access to that sort of removal that also doubles as pressure while still being about as universal.,ModernMagic,ch5svnc,3,t5_2xs5t

The problem with playing Junk is that you still heavily utilize the graveyard while Dega can be a strong midrange shell that can pack cards like RIP.Bolt is one of the strongest cards in Modern and is something I value over Abrupt Decay. Decay is an absolute monster in Legacy but loses its power in Modern while bolt is still at full strength.Finally I believe Ajani and Chandra are better than Garruk Relentless.

1182398,0,t1_ci2kss4, rounds out of ? No thats not oppressive but thats still boring and really good.They do and do not care. Sure if they dont have to they probably wont  but that doesnt mean that they wont and that you can say that they wont. Youre using the fact that they probably dont want to as a reason for them not doing so. However they have and you cant really use it as a reason when you look at the precedent. They have destroyed engines in the past and will probably do so in the future. Also for storm they did destroy the engine Grapeshot is not the card that matters  Seething Song is. And the fact that its still a deck is not to say that they didnt try to kill the deck.Also bans are definitely what Wizards hates. Have you ever played Storm? Its super fragile and super beatable. You cant actually tell me that Seething Song is too strong because it makes turn  wins sometimes and beating storm is actually one of the easiest things in the world if you actually prepared for it. Its like saying Belcher needs to be banned in Legacy  its completely laughable.Jund is still high tier  I wasnt saying that it isnt Im saying that people used that excuse for DRS and they used it for a lot of other bannings and that didnt stop WotC.Also Pod definitely falls into your reason B for banning it.gtIn a format of thousands and thousands of cards thirty of them are banned. You cant tell me that banned cards arent chosen with the utmost care.Is that actually an argument? When WotC has stated that they purposely create BAD CARDS is that an actual argument? Not even regarding the depth of the card pool that still isnt an actual argument because not only is it not chosen with the utmost care see Valakut Wild Nacatl Bitterblossom there is a very reasonable explanation for Pod to be on the list anyways. though I dont think its good enough.,ModernMagic,ci2n0xl,-4,t5_2xs5t

Witchbane orb would be good against Storm but its extremely narrow and they can win before you can get it out.  Really the best defense against storm is to just get a very disruptive opening.

They can get in for a few damage and when they cant anymore they can often take out a mana dork block then sac to do one damage and prevent combat damage useful for lifelink. They can also just get that one more damage that you need to often kill a creature or finish a player off. They can be considered as a small investment almost like a mini rift bolt.

More of what Im getting at is how often of an oversight entry fees are when setting your Magic Budget. Fees are very much a part of playing as evident here.

A new affinity player is usually easy fodder disregarding a total nut draw.Edits However if you can live to stick a Platinum angel with counter backup then you just won as most affinity players that I have played only play a few Galvanic blasts and maybe a Dispatch.  The other great play is to non lock Mindslaver and sac all of their stuff to their Arcbound Ravager and then sac it to itself.  Sometimes Wurmcoil just doesnt get there vs. Affinity due to flying Vault SkirgesPost board it gets better but it should.  U tron routinely sides  cards some people go all the way up to ! but the most Ive sided is  against affinity.  I mean Ive won matches and final rounds vs affinity but Id say overall its probably .

Like you know that feeling when you didnt get an amulet the lands just match up wrong and you just play a turn  Titan and say go.The other problem I have is I dont like playing any combo deck where the combo doesnt just win me the game. I put an early Titan out attack for  get a bunch of lands but I dont just win. Its not like nauseum or storm or twin where the moment I get my combo its over. Its get my combo hold my breath and hope everything goes ok for a turn or two. And I know youll say well we win if and name  specific cards I need in my hand to do a thing but having  cards at a given moment in my opener doesnt happen every game. And my cards do nothing but enable my combo I have no play if I dont have it. Thats why twin can be successful their combo is only two cards they have enough permission and reach to go mid game even if they cant combo.

1683339,0,t1_cjr2rks,I think youre underestimating the power of Wasteland. If the card itself were printed in Modern a larger  than  would run  I think. Even with your Shockwaste many would run . Tec Edge doesnt get played as a  of as much since it is much much worse than Wasteland and Ghost Quarter is only usable in certain decks. I think the amount of people playing color would drop as say UR Delver wasting in Modern would improve the deck.Anyway not sure how youre using Jund and Shardless as a counterargument? Jund Shardless BUG RUG Delver UWR Delver Stoneblade all  Waste. Sure the format would be less greedy in their mana base but Wasteland would hate out many  color decks in general in favor of  color. GBx becomes just BG mostly they could definitely handle the full  in that case and UR decks like Twin and Delver would get a boost. Instead of selfpolicing I think the format would just centralize more. As for unbans I really dont want to see JTMS and Stoneforge in Modern. Cool everyone plays Stoneblade now... Even with a Shockwaste fetching for a shockland would be far more unattractive for everyone. You also cant use Legacy as the only predictor of how good a card would be in Modern. Nobody is playing Remand or Cryptic Command in Legacy and yet those cards see tons of play in Modern.  I think  life is just unprintable as far as current WotC policy goes. ,ModernMagic,cjrcj3i,1,t5_2xs5t

There is really not much you can do about this particular matchup other than to play a deck with a more favorable matchup.Angel Pod is stronger versus combo decks like Splinter Twin but its significantly weaker against decks like burn affinity and infect.  I would not recommend playing Angel pod in the current meta and would opt for Nathan Holidays Melira Pod list from Worcester.The real question isnt Melira vs. Angel Pod its Melira Pod versus Kiki Pod.  Kiki Pod is stronger against RG Tron and Scapeshift because it can combo out faster.  However it does have a shakier C mana base and you are making sacrifices against burn and infect.

Path is another card that should have its count upped. x Path and x Terminate feels much more correct when there are cards that can only really be answered by Path Wurmcoil Gideon. Finally new Sarkhan seems cool but Stormbreath is probably just better in your deck. Its the same as Sarkhan but dodges one of the most relevant removal spells in the format Path. I will agree that Sarkhan is better if youre facing more BGx decks than anything though. If you get Bobs and Lilianas then you can probably drop Arena Nights Whisper and Crackling Doom fun card but Liliana does what it does but better. I really like the base of the deck that you have.

2091261,0,t3_2iu4nh,Hi!I never really liked the polymorph version of cheating out emrakul because it opens you up to getting  for d and forces you to run subpar enablers like Raise the Alarm.  Even resolving polymorph doesnt win you the game right there and there is a very real possibility for other decks to beat you even with an emrakul in playTwin can tap him down with exarchs repeatedly even with the chance of comboing off after you play your polymorph.GBx can use liliana to make you sac emrakul Tron can blow up ostone or exile him with Karn in which case you are completely screwed.Pod has the very real possibility of comboing off or even more embarassing using a zealous conscripts on your emrakul.The new jeskai ascendency deck probably just doesnt care because itll be turn  at the earliest when you can combo off in which case they can combo off and kill you right after they let you resolve polymorph.Of course you are running your own countermagic to disrupt your opponent but it seems pretty flimsy to me that its very possible to lose the game even if you resolve an uncontested polymorph.  Sure you can steal games when they have absolutely no answer at all and you have an emrakul in play but I mean twin wins  of the time when they combo off with no disruption  this deck has a very real chance of losing even after resolving polymorph.Have you considered the Possibility Storm version of the deck? Its turn  instead of turn  but resolving possibility storm typically means you win the game because it blanks all the answers your opponents have unless they get extremely lucky and you actually CAST emrakul allowing yourself to timewalk which is very important.,ModernMagic,cl5n8ka,2,t5_2xs5t

2139086,0,t3_2jh1ig,If you are interested in cheapish decks because who wants to spend  on their first modern deck mtgsalvation has a whole budget modern forum with heaps of crazy ideas.With the introduction of treasure cruise and monastery swiftspear I was only thinking today you could make a budget delver deck on the cheap that would be good enough to let you see the format but cheap enough that you get a feel for the format without severely damaging the wallet.Here is a list I threw together to see what it would cost  ish. Any khans fetches you add improve it as does snapcasters but both are expensive. sleight of hand is the cheap mans serum visions  and although it is pretty risky to run  treasure cruise without fetches it will probably be OK. once again you arent aiming to be a world beater straight away but just get an idea of the format before committing. The reason I think this is a good deck is because you are playing a tempo deck and will be required to learn other players deck lists and powerful cards to determine whether to counter them. Yes you could play something that doesnt require as much background and interaction but if learning the format is important while staying competitive and cheap! this is an option.

No thanks. the reason that rg Tron is getting worse is that aggro is becoming much better and the format is becoming a lot less grindy. This means that your match ups that are clasm or die increase and even then may not save you ex in the zoo matchups. The bans of Drs was a huge kick in the shins to Tron not even mentioning nacatl. That shit sucks as it eliminated Tron bye  round. Post is actually super absurd its basically strictly better than Tron and is way more consistent.

Its a loss in power but it still taps for mana and is still a threat the opponent must address before you ramp out of control. As for the goyf well... Its the price it is for a reason. Hes hard to replace in most lists. Ive gone with  Voice of Resurgence in place of Goyf for being able to try and shut down counterplay.

Free mana as in treasure cruise is almost always a bad decision just look at the modern ban list. Treasure Cruise is almost as powerful as a piece of p and it has no restriction. You could put  delve on any piece and have it dominate modern and thats why vintage is such a Ux format. Legacy has the powerful blue spells we dont in modern and it too is dominated by blue. Until Khans modern was overall quite even in colour pie playability keeping cruise around could change that. The reason I love modern is because of how diverse the decks are and since khans the changes that have happened have really hurt that. Moderns identity has changed drastically because of cruise and only in a matter of two months. I just hope we dont wind up being legacy formats type .. ,ModernMagic,cm4kla4,-3,t5_2xs5t

2391015,0,t1_cm75o9a,Whats actually happening is Delver and Burn are pushing every attrition based deck out of the metagame. I dont think Cruise and Dig are just allowing UR decks to compete with BG decks I think they are singlehandedly redefining the format to favor aggro and combo strategies without really increasing the diversity of the metagame.All thats actually happened in the format is that Jund Junk and UWR in their original incarnations have been dethroned and aggrocombo decks that can compete with delver and burn are filling that void. Similarly Pod has gone from an attrition based deck that wins through extreme value to more of a midrange beatdown deck as evidenced by additions of beatdown cards like siege rhino and thragtusk and removal of cards like reveillark.If you want to talk strictly about the number of decks that are competitively viable then maybe diversity has gone up? Honestly I think that has more to do with this format basically being entirely new than being more diverse. At the moment no one really knows which decks are the best alongside delver and burn. But in the end if you want to talk about a healthy format Id be hesitant to call a meta thats  aggro  control and  combo healthy by any means according to mtgtop.,ModernMagic,cm78j7o,0,t5_2xs5t

2812037,0,t1_cnnom92,I originally dipped into modern when my good friend got me two promo Cryptic Commands. I found a UR Delver Fae deck that I really liked and started with that. I was smashing FMNs with it left and right. Then Treasure Cruise was released and I have been on a spiraling confusion of decks ever since. I quickly switched to the current cantripping aggro delver deck. A control player at heart I didnt like it and I felt dirty inside not using the Cryptic Commands.Ive been tweaking and tuning this deck for a while with and without Young Pyromancers. Ive been testing two versions of the deck the current one and one where I remove the mutavaults for Islands take out the Spellstutters for Young Pyromancers and make room for a couple Vedalken Shackles or Serum Visions. The Young Pyromancer version of this deck doesnt really go off like the UR aggro version but kind of locks them out with counterspells and mild token generation. I really like the Spellstutter version as it provides extra counters and can just lock people out. Mutavault and a Snapcast are really all it takes to close a game out. Or just a couple Mutavaults. I even won with a few Spellstutter Sprites. The game is really remove counter and just setup your beats while denying theirs. There is no need for a haymaker. Ultimately Ive been finding the nonScalding Tarn and Mutavaults to be a little greedy and inconsistent and Ive been getting punished for it. Im going to go back to trying the Young Pyro version with a couple of changes Ive been making. ,ModernMagic,cnnpxzm,2,t5_2xs5t

2877562,0,t1_cnv4f34,First off thanks so much. Its always great to hear these things. Now to your questions back in the day I played several Gifts decks that were more based in blue that did play a large counter suite. These decks almost always include a copy or two of merchant scroll. As it stands im not very high on the concept of counter magic in modern as the format is just a few turns too fast to effectively play a lot of counters. I also dislike the results of playing many counterspells alongside liliana of the viel. It seems to me like the spells you are inclined to play might be better suited for a Mystical Teachings style control deck which is a deck I very much wanted to make happen in modern but never could! including V Clique Tefferi and Venser as win conditions.

Summoning Trap seemed to me to exacerbate both of those problems.Worldspine Wurm also has a shuffle into library effect so unless Im missing something I dont think Im any worse off because of graveyard hate.I see your point on Path probably being on the rise though. But I think with Path on the rise Lingering Souls will also be on the rise which is probably the best way to deal with a Breached Emrakul.My hope is that having less dead draws and more consistency will give me some edge without Emrakul but I havent played my Summoners Pact version enough to make any conclusions.,ModernMagic,cnw9m79,1,t5_2xs5t

3213960,0,t3_2wxdst,First ask yourself how powerful do you want this deck to become? Because this can eventually evolve into Junk which runs very expensive cards. Playsets of Tarmogoyf Liliana of the Veil Verdant Catacombs etc.Or you can go the route of Vengevine which isnt tier  but can put up some results. Playsets of Vengevine Bloodghast Gravecrawler Stinkweed Imp Darkblast Abrupt Decay Grizzly Salvage Woodland Cemetery maybe Satyr Wayfinder maybe Inquisition of Kozilek. Thats probably where you want to be. The most expensive thing is the Verdant Catacombs but you can probably wait for their eventual reprint whenever they return to Zendikar.In Modern its better to go fast and wide than slow and big.

Between past in flames and having so much redundancy in the deck thoughtsieze decks arent your problem. Decks that race you like burn and infect sound like the bigger problem and theyre around cause abzan is around but infect seems weak to twin and everyone is packing burn hate so well see if they stick around infect is pretty much a combo deck too.

I have personally found raise the alarm to be fairly mediocre especially a  of. a lot of people are running timely reinforcements in the raise the alarm spot and gather the townsfolk is also an option. raise the alarms instant speed is decent but I dont know that it has been a game changer for me. mirran crusader is nice to have but your meta seems to be relatively free of junk and abzan. auriok champion is another creature that does a lot of work in the current meta. a fun but it wont make the deck more competitive addition is  squadron hawk.in my experience BW tokens is a great deck that can win a lot of matchups but it needs a strong land base. I myself only have two marsh flats and  godless shrine but it makes a world of difference.

Point is perception is key and anyone looking to get into modern has that outlook from the get go.Players dont ban cards wotc does. And wotc has shown that they will hit things that perform at the top consistently whether deserved or not isnt up to me or you. If wotc was more transparent and open to discussing the banlist with the player base before making decisions then Id agree with you.

The difference between winning and losing can very often be what you choose to target discard at T  what can you deal with based on your hand what screws up their curve the most what absolutely wrecks you what needs to go now and what can wait a few turns before paring away. The deck encourages knowing the other decks of the format more than most due to reasons aforementioned. It is not the easy deck you are describing and based on what you describe I believe your rack testing partner was new at it didnt know what they were doing or were working with a severely deficient list. ,ModernMagic,cp07wip,4,t5_2xs5t
3265029,0,t1_cp0fdj2,you realize that then entire article boils down to now these interactive cards arent reeeally interactive in type  vintage are they?they also say that counters are interactive but they lead to noninteractive games down the line. gtCounters are generally highly interactive cards involving decisions based around the other players cards and predictions about what he might be able to do next but in Rome the free nature of Force of Will made it perfect for forcing through a combo in a room full of Force of Will. In certain decks even Cabal Therapy is used in essentially the same manner as Grim Monolith Dark Ritual or a cheap catalyst that facilitates an essentially noninteractive game plan down the line. finally remember they have hard counters that cost nothing we have soft counters that cost . its an entirely different animal. ,ModernMagic,cp0fuvk,3,t5_2xs5t
3269244,0,t1_cp0szqv,I played around with my list after looking at yours  Notable additions and subtractions from original list   Remand  Izzet Charm  Ideas Unbound  Visions of Beyond  Snapcaster Mage  Retraction Helix.  What I realized after playtesting against the URw control deck is that interaction especially in the form of protecting this decks combo pieces as theyre hitting the board.  My main reason for combining the Jeskai Ascendancy combo with the Blistecoil WeirdParadise Mantle combo was to broaden how the deck can do what it wants to do.  Hate out the Ascendancy?  Thats fine Blistercoil Weird and Paradise Mantle can do it on their own.  No Mantle on the board?  The man land will do it.  Fatestitcher in the yard?  Perfect.  However in practice giving the combo more potential pieces did not prove to be the unstoppable onslaught of comboing opportunity that I thought it would be and the RemandIzzet Charm backup is hopefully what it needs to be  more resilient.

3274293,0,t3_2xmq53,It is going to be hard to say much without a list but I will try to be general. Versus BGx your best way to win is a transform post sideboard your best cards in the match up are Jace Architect of thought KeranosBatterskull and Sower of temptation along with Blood Moon which can be game ending if not played around. You want to side out the majority of your combo pieces leaving in  Twins at most. You are essentially on the bolt snap bolt plan with card advantage and tempo generated with sowerjacekeranos.  Versus zoo if you play anger of the gods that card is very strong against them but one of your best plans is to just Exarch end of term and combo out Tribal flames is one of their only cards that can kill Exarch and it is a sorcery so make sure to not try to do upkeep shenanigans with Exarch and just wait till end of the turn.

3350351,0,t3_2yiu93,The matchup is pretty miserable. I dont know where people get as close as  in the matchup  this matchup does not look even on paper and its not close when playing. The reasons are all stated already and in theory it is not really possible to outtempo them with your secondary plan.    There is a way to shift the matchup though depending on your list. Leaning more in the direction of Patrick Dickmann the more Spreading Seas and Blood Moon you play the easier it gets. Try to find a good split that works for you and try to force them into the situation that you dont have to stare down a Rhino after it drained you. This is a way to steal games you usually should not have won otherwise.    You basically have to overload on threats they have to Decay in order to slip one through in order to win against them. You are on the Blood Moon plan? Well play out your Seas as a bait. Make them spend their spells inffectively  thats how you have a slight chance of winning. Of course this plan fails when they doublediscard you and have a Decay open. You need to win the games where they dont have that Pray that your opponent keeps a hand full of Path to Exile and Siege Rhinos when you are on to SSea them and then Moon them for good. ,ModernMagic,cpa5y3d,2,t5_2xs5t

People are sideboarding for it. People are informing their gameplay decisions around it let them. Have your cake and eat it too by not having this card that is in all honesty pretty bad oftentimes sit in you hand.Twin is a great deck but Twin is not a great card. Playing fewer copies answers this problem thats how we got ourselves down to three. After we had three cutting back to two was relatively easy and it hasnt been missed. We still draw an outrageous number of cards most games we find it if we need it.Were also playing more Mites which is a much worse combo creature.Infect is not a matchup I want to combo in they have cards to fight me over the combo and if they untap afterwards Im probably dead. Id much rather kill everything that moves playing heavy control then beat them to death with a Goyf I can safely deploy on turn two usually or later when I can leave up mana still. Goyf is actually very good versus Infect. Im not trying to race them if they have a creature in play still then Im not doing my job.I actively do not want to combo in Modern right now.

3412866,0,t3_2zay5e,I do like your list but Im not sure Id bother with assault formation at all. You can basically run up to  dorans already with Treefolk Harbinger although I guess formations are much harder to kill especially game  or game  if you board them in and the opponent doesnt expect them.Other than that Id definitely ditch at least Wall of Omens and Wall of Tanglecord and similar cards because even though they block well they cant ever attack and that isnt really where midrange wants to be even if you are getting a  defender for . Id replace them with cards like Siege Rhino and Tarmogoyf that do still get better with a Doran effect out but are also good on their own if Doran or Formation gets removed during combat for example.EDIT oh and I very much like Collected Company in here this seems like the perfect shell for the card running cheap high impact creatures like Doran.,ModernMagic,cphai6g,2,t5_2xs5t

3425370,0,t3_2zglxu,I like the list but mana tithe seems kinda loose as well as weartear. Playing some amount of discard is probably better to combat the combo match up given that your turn one plays are limited to bolt and souls attendant. Duress limits life lose or IoK hits many of the big combo threats.  Path main also has a significant amount of advantage given that a siege rhino or any creature with  toughness will be difficult for you to beat game one.Mentor of the Weak may not be doing what you need.  CMC cards that dont have some kind of inherent protection or effect are a big liability. Think of the CMC creatures in modern there are ether bolt proof or hexproof Exarch Etched Champion have some kind of ETB effect Reclamation Sage or Finks or are way above curb Master of Etherium Loxodon Smiter  Thus some kind of draw engine could also fit. Maybe sign in blood or even altars reap give you more late game power. Dangerous Wager or even tormenting voice are good options as well You also might be interested in something I have been trying in my ur aggro list. I have been trying out colateral damage as a  of for more late game reach in the case of a board stall. i.e.swing with tokens sac any of the blocked ones for three points of damage to the face or finish off another threat.As for the side board you have some of the same problems that BW Tokens has.

3456840,0,t1_cpmavb5,I guess what i was getting at with the mention of Legacy is the cards in the deck arent likely to lose their value.  Especially Aethervials lords and Mutavaults.

The great thing about this deck is that Im able to do multiple things in a turn and I honestly think that  and up might be pushing it for artifacts.

3466943,0,t1_cpnercq, I think that this deck is fundamentally about board position more than immediate damage so Im not really a fan of Giant Growth here as a functional Lightning Bolt to the face.  I like Giant Growth in decks with smaller lower toughness creatures because its also protection from sizedependent removal and its a way to help a little guy bring down a bigger threat in combat.  But since youre running a deck full of big guys I would rather see a different tool employed.  Rancor is good because it gives you some evasion through chump blockers and its almost like a power drop creature in and of itself which lends toward the board position concept.  Giant Growth is just a onetime deal so unless its winning the game on the spot...no thanks.But if you want to play a combat trick there are quite a few very good options out there.  I would probably start with Vines of Vastwood since that counters hard removal spells.  Another thing to consider is playing acual equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice etc.,ModernMagic,cpngg05,3,t5_2xs5t

Why do you play  Rakdos Charm? I dont see why you want to play four of them. The first two modes wont find a target in many matchups and the third mode will often hurt you more than the opponent.  And I guess in todays Meta there are not enough targets for Bolts so I am still in favor of dumping them in favor of PathTerminateDismember.

Use the fundamentals from your deck like Delver Mana Leak and Azorius Charm Feeling of Dread but add some cards like Lightning bolt Izzet Charm and Grim Lavamancer to add tempo. You need Spell Snare also Spell Pierce would be good too. These protect your win conditions. You might not be able to afford Serum Visions but if you can get those if not then use Thought Scour.

Its not that it stifles creature creation like the other poster said because theyve said it before that RampD does not take into account eternal and non rotating formats when creating new cards. However the problem is that the new world order mandates a power creep in creatures which means that Pod will get better and better. You can see that with the printing of Siege Rhino which is a ridiculous creature in by itself. Having a consistent tutor for him is even more ridiculous.

Youre definitely not favored in a match where you have to face down something like Kataki or Stony Silence but you win game  almost every time and have a reasonable shot against anything.

3726115,0,t1_cqgxe4n,Control decks dont use serum visions because its a bad card.  If you want a better idea of what I want look at the fact that every control deck has run x ponder in every format that its been legal.  Ponder and to a lesser degree preordain give you control over what you draw when you cast it which is invaluable to a deck that needs something specific right now.  As for jace its true that basically only control will use it but that doesnt mean it solves all of the fundamental problems with control in modern.  All jace does is finish games that you were ahead in control decks in modern have a really really hard time getting far enough ahead for him to do that.  Control does need help finishing games and Jace would probably fill that role well but it also needs help answering an enormous swath of decks with the same  cards.  RampD seems set on powerful narrow answers to fast linear strategies which means the control deck needs to be able to find those cards fast enough to not lose.  Jace is way too slow to fill that hole  and so is ancestral visions in all likelihood so we need something cheap to find our answers.  Control needs preordain or ponder a lot more than it needs Jace.,ModernMagic,cqh03kn,3,t5_2xs5t

3751232,0,t3_33djzj,Against bloom titan try to keep counter magic in hand and get them to waste resources by countering the right things.  Game  is a tough matchup that you will probably lose without experience but games  and  are better after siding in of blood moon and some number of artifact destruction.  If they side out the hive mind combo which they should you shouldnt have too hard a time beating them down post board.Burn is always a hard matchup that requires tight play and averagetogood draws to win.  Your game plan is to make their cards as inefficient as possible so you need to be stopping their creatures from doing too much damage and killing them whenever possible while you assemble the combo.  Ive only played a few Fae matches and advise depends heavily on their list but try not to let bitterblossom resolve and never play into spellstutter sprite.  Postboard blood moon can be good if theyre running a lot of nonfetch duals and manlands.  Grim lavamancer is huge in the matchup try to keep one alive and your graveyard full.  Above all be patient.  Resolve a creature or sideboard bomb and just slowly start beating them down until theyre forced to make a move.  Create a board state of inevitability and you will usually win.UWR control is a strange matchup thats also heavily decklist dependent.  If its the snap and resto only version remands get really strong and your tempo plan will often get there.  If theyre playing a more slow version you want hard counters and you want to commit resources when it will exhaust theirs.  Blood moon is strong here.  Be sure to have a remand for when they try to snap back a counterspell for the glorious card advantage.For infect bolts and electrolyze are crazy good here but you have to play around the pumps.  Your creatures are blockers and theres little they can do to stop your combo if you live long enough to cast it.  Side in artifact hate and enchant hate if you have it for spellskite and inkmoth.Affinity is another matchup where your removal and artifact hate are essential.  Spellskite can block an ethersworn champion.  Save artifact removal for platings ravagers and masters.  Bolt overseers and flying creatures.  I keep a Shatterstorm in the side for this matchup and it just wins if I draw it.  Always have an answer for inkmoth  plating but if theres no plating inkmoth usually wont speed up their clock.What color are you splashing?  Nearly all UR twin lists splash one color for some sideboard options.  ,ModernMagic,cqjv7aj,3,t5_2xs5t

3761435,0,t1_cqkzz9y,My point about the game favoring blue isnt that blue is too good. In a format with a large card pool you get a lot of opportunity for linear decks. Blue is the only color that the color pie gives tools to for reliably keeping a large format from devolving into a mess.

3866303,0,t3_34oons,Your best plan is to try to burn me out. Thundermaw as a two of is incredibly good. Pulse as a  of is mandatory. You dont have good ways to deal with souls and its just solid removal. Olivia I dont like because I think she costs too much mana to function. She also dies to bolt against twin. I think shes fine as a sideboard option for this match up but maindeck seems greedy.  Dark confidant is not a card I think you want in your deck. Ive played against jund before a couple times and i just left their bob alone. I killed everything else and used lingering soulsrhino to kill him.   I honestly cant think of a good reason to be playing jund over junk. Its why im playing junk not jund. You get access to bolt but lose souls and rhino. So I suppose the advantage you gain is in putting a clock on junk. You are always the beat down. Scavenging ooze should be a card you try to enable. It gives you a cheap threat to try to fight junk and is solid in most matchups.   As ustTurnNegator mentions chandra is very good here. She prevents your opponents from blocking and kills souls tokens. She is one of the tools jund used to use to win the mirror match. Grim lavamancer could also be a good addition as a  of to further allow you to go to the dome.

This is particularly true for some lands  youll see pro decks only running blue no red playing Scalding Tarns as fetches  when Polluted Deltas are the absolute functional equivalent in their deck if youre new to modern to explain this you would only need one overlapping color to fetch the relevant shockland which has two land types in this case it would be a shockland with one of its two types being island. Horizon canopy is another example  a fine addition to Bogles but hardly the most important  in the deck  youll just maybe gain a couple of  in consistency but at the cost of making the deck around  more expensive  not necessarily a worthwhile cost for FNMlevel play.Edited some additional explanation to clarify for any newtomodern readers.,ModernMagic,cqzh1tc,5,t5_2xs5t

Holy shit after typing that Im going to need to test it. As for its power level its firmly someplace below tier . Some say . and some say .

Every awesome creature printed would come with a backlash as players saw them bashing their faces in in Pod decks.  Any two creatures that happened to be a combo would be utilized in a pod deck.

I didnt play Pod. I have no interest in playing Pod. Pod should be legal and if the other decks arent as strong then cards should be printedunbanned to make them stronger and competitive. Repeatedly banning the cards from the best deck is not how you sustainably balance a card game. Modern is practically Yugioh at this point.The reason that Pod was good is because Wizards is constantly printing stronger creatures not because new creatures of the same power level makes it stronger they clearly dont. Constant new creatures that are constantly stronger and stronger and stronger is what makes Pod better over time. Theyve been doing this for the last few years and its very tiring.Pod doesnt limit creature design. Pod limits creature power creep. And thats a good thing.,ModernMagic,crtsvi5,0,t5_2xs5t

4178740,0,t3_38o7v5,. In terms of efficiency buying all at once from a place like cardhoarder mtgotraders etc... will take much less time than going from bot to bot looking for the best price. You might be able to save some tickets buying individually using something like the mtgowikiprice library to search for the bots with the best prices though. Disclaimer Only mtgowikiprice bots are shown here which isnt nearly all of the available bots. I use this method frequently though and you probably get at least close to the best price available this way. . Spreads are generally stable on staples just depends on everything else. They can be good or bad depending on how the cards are trending.. There are dailies mans and v matches with prize support. Descending EV in that order. v is practically not worth it if you are looking to make tickets off of winning. You need something like a  win rate to come out ahead. I think mans you need like a  win percentage to profit and dailies you just need to at least  once every  dailies I think. There are constructed open rooms too where you can grind away for free to get practice. Your opponents will vary from casualbeginner to very competitive its a bit of a lottery playing in the free rooms.Id definitely recommend MTGO to anyone who enjoys playing matgic especially if youre just looking to get a lot of magic in at your convenience.,ModernMagic,crwkxu2,2,t5_2xs5t

Auriok Champion beats grixis delver on its own and is only  mana on the play it gets under Mana Leak and otherwise since its only  mana we can wait for five mana or try and sneak it in after something else later.

4231245,0,t1_cs2bzym,Just so I dont write another novel Ill just say that I understand all of your card choices and your thought process on running each of them. None of them are bad its a question of preference. A few commentsKor Firewalker is great against the mirror. Its nearly an autowin. Unfortunately I dont like it in any other matchup. To beat the mirror I run xHelix mainboard and a couple deflecting palm with more in the side. I feel that theyre more versatile.Searing Blaze is generally a  of in the main with  or  more in the side depending on what I feel the meta will look like. Havent run searing blood in a long time and havent missed it.Blood Moon is great in mono red but its a real issue for you in Naya. In mono red I always run it in the side since it autowins some matchups but with three colors I use Molten Rain. Its also on the plan which is nice.Revelry is a  of in my side.Path is a hard one. Its lovely to deal with creatures and is the best answer for Firewalker. Unfortunately it also gives a land which can be huge in some matchups. Ive literally never had an Iona resolve against me and Ive only seen champion in soul sisters where Id rather have skullcrackAtarkas. Not running it means I concede some matchups but this is something Im at peace with since in my meta it was far too often a dead card. In the lt of matches where I brought it in it was amazing assuming I drew it but in  of matches I wanted the spaces in my side for other cards.

Blue does it with filtering cantrips draw spells and scry and similar riders on spells. Black does it with tutoring effects. Green does it by thinning lands from its deck with ramp and playing creatures that can generate mana.

Snapcaster is less important when Treasure Cruise is around because with Cruise theres no need for incremental card advantage and reuse of things. You can just draw more things with Cruise.

4529844,0,t1_ct1jnd3,As a general statement yes it is asinine. As a statement specific to dig through time is actually pretty apt. Wild nacatl might actually be a great analogue. The card was banned shortly after moderns inception because it was actually quite dominant. If you played a non affinity aggro deck it probably was naya and played nacatl. Things had changed in the time between its banning and unbanning. Had they unbanned the card shortly after they had banned it it likely would have risen to dominance again because the format would not have changed much in its short absence. The same is likely true of dig through time. Right now blue is very very strong in modern. Lightning bolt serum visions and snapcaster mage are the three most common cards in modern. Releasing dig through time back in to this environment is pretty foolish we know how powerful it is so we know its not going to see little play or have no affect on the format. Its going to go right to the top of that list and hang out there with serum visions and snapcaster. Perhaps once the format changes significantly and blue is not as dominant as it is now then we can safely get DTT back and if will find that middle ground but it needs to spend more time on vacation for the health of the format. ,ModernMagic,ct1mf8n,2,t5_2xs5t

As for a card that I feel is underrated Niveous Wisps. I just love this card because its so cheap and it offers so much. Snapcaster loves cards like this because it oozes value  with him similarly to how Unsummon is forgettable but Vapor Snag is a force when combined with Snapcasters and Bolts.

5012868,0,t3_3jj1ko,The main thing as with all symmetrical effects is that you can build your deck to not care and they will not. Historically some of the most powerful magic cards have been symmetrical Balance comes to mind but just like the Wrath in a control deck one side builds their deck with it in mind.This has several effects. It can slow down greedy decks and pretty much close the game on super greedy decks. Decks like Abzan and Zoo affinity and Jund to a lesser extent and U Tron all find Blood Moon annoying often adding turns to the clock. Decks like Scapshift RG Tron Tribal Zoo any c decks and Amulet are all basically shut down by it.. It keeps people honest. If you are a red deck and post board you start fetching basics they have to respect the threat of blood moon even if you do not have it. This greatly limits their options in a format where the tier  decks are basically all colour. This is a very underrated effect of blood moon and can also often buy a turn.Its printings are in The dark which for all intents and purposed has no effect on supply th which was before the explosion of players which really began around M MMA which was a set largely criticised by its print run so small it increased the value of the cards in it and maybe one other cant remember where. Given this its not hard to imagine that supply is really short and demand far outstrips it.,ModernMagic,cuq8nl8,1,t5_2xs5t

5379827,0,t3_3ooih4,I have the deck and it can do some broken things but it also has some pretty big weaknesses. It doesnt usually do anything at all until turn  which gives your opponent time to get the ball rolling and you tend to be pretty far behind by the time you cast a balance. If your opponent holds up a remand on your big play turn youre just going to outright lose. Greater Gargadon tends to be an all or nothing play as well which can get shut down by a single path to exile after youve dumped all your resources into balancing and swinging with the gargadon. Artifact hate is a real problem and unfortunately due to affinity theres a lot of it. If you think stony silence is good against affinity imagine it against a deck where it reads W your opponent cant generate mana. Kolaghans command blows up land against you as well as does ancient grudge. Lastly it mulligans and top decks pretty badly. Its pretty common to have to mull down to  or  to get a workable hand and if your original balance gambit fails youre left top decking borderposts several turns in a row. Its a fun deck and I like it but it has enough weaknesses that are inherent to the deck that I wouldnt suggest it as a primary modern deck. As a fun deck to bring out once in a while that can even win with some good draws its great though. ,ModernMagic,cvzc0gw,4,t5_2xs5t

The reason it is so good in modern and legacy is because it works really well with cards like fetch lands  mana can trips and other such cards that fill the yard quickly. Yes it would need to be in a set where it cant be a  consistently by turn  or  but I dont see why it couldnt be reprinted in standard.

I keep a lot of other notes on my sheet such as when my opponent scryed on top T or TT with Visions their cards in hand from ProbeDiscard and anything else I find I want to know at a glance.I really like this because if you keep good upkeep of the sheet you know for certain the size of a Goyf at all times.  You generally have some level of information asymmetry. Also you wont get in trouble for misrepresenting the size of your goyfs because its merely your personal notes.I find this a handy tip and I recommend it highly if youll be playing Goyf.

I play RUG delver in legacy also and Tarmo Twin in modern and while theyre very different decks they are all about tempo and playing around your opponent. Its the most fun when you get into racing situations so you can be tricky with your flash creatures and instants. For instance if you have a tapped goyf and somebodys attacking you you can flash in Bounding Krasis and either tap the creature that they left to block or untap your goyf and then eat two of their creatures.

5449183,0,t3_3pp06c,I love Grixis delver and Ive been playing it since the deck first got popular. It is a very complex deck to master the sequencing is huge and affects how the rest of the game plays out. Some games can feel unstoppable when an early delver flips with counter backupremoval or a turn two fattie. The deck is in a very fun position where it can get the tempo win with quick beats and bolts  snaps or fall back on tasigur snap and kommand to grind out advantage. The deck can actually outJund Jund which is pretty sweet.That being said I just dont think delver is quite there yet. It has some pretty bad matchups against some of the tier decks burn rg tron Grixis control can be tough and merfolk. It doesnt feel quite as powerful as control and doesnt have the twin combo to fall back on so right now I think it is the weakest of the three Grixis decks although in my opinion the most fun to play.Someone actually just compiled a list of all the decks that made top  in all the SCG states events and delver only had  showings which is abysmal for a tier deck. The deck is the cheapest of the Grixis decks to build though and if you do build it you can very easily build the other decks mentioned.

BR just isnt as strong a colour combination as BG because Tarmogoyf is just that good. You can get Bolt anyway as a splash in your BGx deck. BG picks up so much by splashing the best removal spell Bolt plus an amazing manland Ravine or Rhino and some amazing sideboard options. Faeries gets wrecked by Zoo amp Affinity and nastily hosed by Blood Moon. UB Control needs something like Ancestral Vision. Also the finishers in UB completely suck. Creeping Tar Pit is probably the best way available to kill people no jokes. If you want to play a control deck why not play a control deck with a onecard wincon Scapeshift? ok yes I know I play UB control myself but still...You basically explained yourself why WR and GR arent very good on their own. Mardu midrange is again just a midrange deck that doesnt play Tarmogoyf. BW Tokens is a reasonable deck but it doesnt really benefit from a painful red splash. Sultai isnt crazy but Im not sure blue really helps out the BGx shell very much. Cryptic Command isnt at all what the ThoughtseizeGoyfLili deck wants to be doing and while Serum Visions is great actually killing people with Bolt and KCommand is just better. ,ModernMagic,cw95hmg,1,t5_2xs5t

5605486,0,t3_3rsrm6,Ive had some pretty real success playing Zoo. I feel like it only has  bad matchup in JundJunk. I made top  at both my state events this year. Ive played to several st and nd place finishes at FNM. I unfortunately opted to play my nd favorite deckTron at PPTQs and didnt do well. The one GP I went to this year I opted to play Affinity because I wanted to lend out as many cards as I could to get all my friends to have a large magic tournament experience.        But regardless when I decided to play Zoo I based my decision of of this deck                The th place deck played by Corbett Gray is where I started. I liked the idea of playing Eidolon in Zoo but I didnt want to include Thalia in the main deck and I didnt want to include Geist in the sideboard because it does make the mana quite a bit worse.    My first version that I placed th place at my state championship with was almost identical to that build. I cut one Thalia for an Atarkas Command one Become Immense for  more Boros Charm and finally I cut the  Scalding Tarns for  Arid Mesa. My sideboard was also quite a bit different  Atarkas Command  Destructive Revelry  Rending Volley  Rest for the Weary  Kataki Wars Wage  Thalia Guardian of Thraben.      The deck felt incredibly strong. I applied a lot of early pressure and kept opponents on the back foot nearly the entire game. Jund seemed like it was the worst matchup but everything else felt like I was just a little bit faster and applied a little bit more pressure. The deck had a ridiculous matchup against twin wherein they essentially have to Twin turn  and I had to be on the draw. This was around the time Grixis Twin started gaining some traction and the deck has a slightly worse matchup against Grixis than the traditional but overall still quite strong. Infect had a difficult time beating our burn and Eidolon. Overall our deck was also very hard to hate against.             After playing the deck religiously for  months its finally starting to see some very real finishes. Heres the version I played to an th place finish at my latest states                I think there are really  reasons to play this deck outside of personal enjoyment. The first is that you play some really fast creatures that dont die as easily to pyroclasm and this allows you to really pressure their life total early many times before they have times to even fully setup. The second is I play  spells that essentially deal  damage. Boros Charm GhorClan Rampager and Atarkas Command are really powerful magic cards. Boros Charm most of the time is  damage to the dome. But Ive definitely pulled off the combo with GhorClan Rampager to deal  or more trample damage on turn . Ive even had a situation this last event I played at where the permanents gain indestructible this turn mattered a ton against an Elf deck. This is the deck that takes the most advantage of Boros Charm. GhorClan Rampager is almost always a  mana  damage burn spell but sometimes it also works as a  damage spell and creature removal. You have to choose your spots well with him but many times your opponent will have to tap out to keep up with you. Finally Atarkas Command is nearly always a  damage spell between the  damage and the . The final reason to play this deck is that its really hard to hate. The fairly even split between burn spells and creatures means that your deck doesnt just fold to typical burn hate like Leyline of Sanctity or Kor Firewalker. It also means that cards like Ghostly Prison arent as great against us.        If youre set against playing Tarmogoyf I completely understand but there are plenty of other options in Flinthoof Boar Monastery Swiftspear Steppe Lynx Loam Lion. Those are all viable options. I personally think Tarmogoyf gives us a little bit more because it helps with our Jund matchup because we essentially always have bigger goyfs because of our GhorClan Rampagers.,ModernMagic,cwrwxul,2,t5_2xs5t

5713246,0,t3_3tdbw2,Not a lot of the cards you listed are incremental lifegain .  .  .But lifegain is always good. What colors are you in anyway?Green has some of the best options like Kitchen Finks Scavenging Ooze and Courser of Kruphix.If youre including Wurmcoil Engine and lifelink in general cards like Rhox War Monk are playable if youre in the right colors. If youre in BW and can afford to play utility lands you have access to Vault of the Archangel.One of my favorites is Lone Missionary. Four life is just actually a lot of life. Considering a burn deck does its damage in increments of three for the most part Lone Missionary not only negates one burn spell but provides you a  body.Ajani Vengeant is one of the strongest planeswalkers out there and hes a source of lifegain.I play Sphinxs Rev in UW and Esper Control builds and I love it. Batterskull is a fine card if there isnt too much KCommand or artifact hate in general. Thragtusk is more of a sideboard card but it is maindeckable in the right build.Sorin Solemn Visitor is a card that can gain you a ton of life if you drop it when you have a bit of a board. I dont think hes stronger than Elspeth Knight Errant or even Gideon Ally of Zendikar in a vacuum but Sorins ability to gain life is what might make a deck want him over Elspeth or Gideon.Hmmm . . .Baneslayer Angel and Archangel of Thune can both function as fine curvetoppers that have the potential to gain you tons of life. Archangel of Thune supports a team of creatures better but Baneslayer is likely more powerful on her own. Auriok Champion has the soul sister effect of gaining you one life upon creature entry . . . and its maindeckable in not just Soul Sisters but tokensbased strategies as well. Being prored and problack just makes it an incredibly useful card to have around though it wont do much of anything in some matchups.Azorius Charm Jeskai Charm and Ojutais Command are on the fringes of playable depending on your deck. Similarly if youre playing a greenbased strategy Primal Command can be a versatile source of lifegain. ,ModernMagic,cx5a8hn,4,t5_2xs5t

5911035,0,t1_cxudqop,Im not arguing it is too strong generically speaking. It is however entirely too strong against a certain subset of decks namely fair interactive ones. The fact that a tron player will more than likely get absolutely wrecked at some point in a tournament by some aggrocombo deck or another doesnt help the player who made the mistake of bringing a fair interactive deck to the tournament and got run over by tron. Tron has more nongames in either direction than any other deck I can think of in the format. Thats not something Id consider healthy.,ModernMagic,cxugwow,2,t5_2xs5t

Plan A is pretty solid and having the combowin backup plan gives a second angle that makes people really secondguess siding out their spot removal against us and gives outs to games that would just otherwise be completely lost.

It does put you on a fast clock like a lot of decks can do T but still easily disrupted by several cards Path Terminate double Bolt etc.Id honestly be shocked if it had an actual T kill percentage of . That seems way too high even against decks with no interaction. You need Bloom UG Karoo basicnonKaroo Amulet Hivemind and G Pact or B Pact wcreature or U Pact  CMC spell for T Hivemind kill. Thats at LEAST  cards for combo sometimes . No way is that happening  of the time unless you are running x Hiveminds most lists run .

They have had some good series about deck building building on a budget impacts of new sets etc.  They recently started a video series which I havent seen yet where they are trying to play through the top decks of modern against each other and discuss game plan and side boarding which is both ambitious and a good resource. The part where they sometimes suffer is not having very strict outline so they sometimes go off topic or jump right into the topic without fully explaining why this is important or giving the setup.   Some of their side conversations end up being very enlightening though. I listen to each of the podcasts I think they do a nice job and are producing some quality content. I recommend it.

The worry that a lot of people have about a SFM unban is that it would push aggro out of the format. The fact that it doesnt change the numbers by a significant amount suggests that SFM is possibly a safe unban.

6168923,0,t1_cyqsles,Tron is an odd deck.  Much like Bloom it can be the best if it has a great draw or it can do nothing but turdle and die.Tron on the play can crush the thoughtseizegtTarmogoyfgtFulminator draw if it draws correctly but it can be crushed by not flowing correctly and being blown out by Fulminator into Kolaghans command into more fulminators.Ive tested it as much as to be expected as the card just came out.  The card is strong enough that it will change the format around it.  Even the last ability of making a  isnt irrelevant as can be used as a pseudo storage of mana to play wurmcoils if Tron isnt hit.The matchup against Twin and scapeshift radically changes because of Wail.  Scapeshift I would say is a moderately favorable matchup now as the only way that scapeshift can combo through is with Cryptic or Dispel with Scapeshift.  This seems unlikely but possible.  It turns a matchup that used to be nearly impossible for Tron to favorable.The twin matchup comes down to the Twin player.  If the player is very good at twin then it doesnt change the matchup as much as it does if the player isnt good.  Players that just go for it as in trouble and cant just assume that they won if they jam the combo.  Theres a lot more play to the matchup now which is great.  Its a catmouse style game of if they have it or not.  The tron player can still jam things like Karn or Ulamog without much worry but its the Twin player that needs to be constantly thinking whereas before they didnt.

6203627,0,t3_40k471,Unfair decks are usually hated because they give the impression of requiring very little skill to win with.The thing is one of the advantages of playing said decks is exactly the fact that they come with a bunch of socalled free wins.Tron can often cast something ridiculous like KarnWurmcoil on turn  or UginNewlamog on turn  and these cards are very hard to interact with that early so your opponent will often feel thats not fair since youve done nothing to earn your win.The same thing can be said of Amulet Griselshoalbrand or even Burn and Infect. Sometimes you just win easily and your opponent did nothing but play lands so its very comprehensible why they would feel salty about it.Tron specifically relies on a certain combination of lands to power out its more busted spells. Statistically with  copies of each  cards like Expedition Maps its actually not that hard to have the full Tron assembled by turn  or  but it still feels very unfair   mana on turn  or  mana on turn  is bullshit by regular Magic rules. The skill required to play these decks is often related to sequencing  and how to beat hate when playing a very unfairlinear deck you accept the tradeoff of facing more powerful and focused hate cards. Its a different skill set when comparing to traditional magic so its often said you dont need skill to play it just luck.,ModernMagic,cyusbjf,36,t5_2xs5t

6211371,0,t3_40nbpe,Im not an expert in the deck as Ive never played it and Ive only seen it on camera but from what Ive seen happen I think the safest thing to do would be to ban Amulet of Vigor and keep Summer Bloom.The primary thing that enables Bloom to create such massive advantage so early on is due to the fact that the lands come in untapped which allow for the turn  Prime Time or what have you. Without the Amulet of Vigor a turn  Bloom would either allow you to play two bouncelands putting you to  mana on turn  or Azusa and a few more bouncelands putting you up a bit faster. To me at least this is no different from turn  Tron and KarnWurmcoil in RG Tron decks. If youre willing to ban Amulet Summer Bloom becomes just an effective ramp deck that plays Prime Time Bloom and Azusa instead of Tron lands to ramp. I think it would be a lot fairer of a deck without absolutely throttling its existence. Keeping around a third big mana deck in Modern in addition to Tron and Bx Eldrazi would in my opinion keep the format quite diverse. On the other hand if you choose to ban Bloom instead of Amulet you are basically okaying the existence of the nature of the deck but simply wanting to make it less consistent. I think this is a more dangerous route for Wizards to take though definitely one they have done in the past where they cripple a deck rather than allow it to transform into a new way of playing. Again though Ive never actually played the deck so take what I say with a grain of salt. Id love to talk about it though. ,ModernMagic,cyvnzfv,9,t5_2xs5t
6215549,0,t1_cyvzpgq,Goodness. Apologies for not reading this whole post but I did check your decklist. My quick feels  Tasigur  Angler is better than  Tasigur.  The fish is bigger and thatll keep you from legend rule selfharm. Id also split  IoK into  IoK and  Thoughtseize. Tron is gaining a lot of traction and youre saving money on the Thoughtseizes hah. Swap Go for the Throat for Victim of Night. Affinity is gonna hurt a lot more than some guys rogue Zombie brew. I know its BB but youll have that. Love the Shriekmaw good tech for getting creatures in the yard and getting a bonus. There are a couple other dudes that die for value you may want to consider off the top of my head theres Fulminator Mage who would also assist in the Tron matchup. What about using actual Golgari GraveTroll? He turns on Delve and Marauder. You wouldnt get to call it dredgless no more tho ,ModernMagic,cyw53az,1,t5_2xs5t

6220518,0,t1_cywln2j,A deck having good and bad matchups is a normal and healthy. Decks even top tier ones which is a point Ill get to later having matchups they literally cannot win or can only win by drawing narrow sideboarded hate cards to the degree that these matchups are present in modern is not particularly healthy. Its a question of degree and prevalence. I think modern has more lopsided matchups among commonly played deck than any constructed format. I also think that the degree to which these matchups are lopsided is also noteworthy and unhealthy.To elaborate on my statement earlier about top decks I made that distinction to avoid this conversation turning into a discussion about fringe cases. Yes legacy miracles is incapable of beating cloudpost without some serious luck going on. However while post in Legacy is a very fringe deck tron and Bx Eldrazi in modern are not. Odds are almost certain that youll run into decks that make a point of just crushing some matchups at the expense of others. Nongames of Magic are unavoidable to some degree in any format but they are  not something that should be common in highlevel Magic and their presence explains the hesitancy so many top players and people who are just looking for skillintensive games of Magic where ingame decisions matter have about modern as a competitive format. ,ModernMagic,cywpeuo,3,t5_2xs5t
6221142,0,t1_cywqdw2,While I agree on  paths and dropping blue I prefer a  split between the walls just because roots makes your games so much more explosive.   If you feel bad about pontiff put him in the sideboard. Running him comes at the very reasonable cost of putting one black source in your deck overgrown tomb.   If he doesnt fit the meta cause there arent many s running around which I cant imagine due to infect Pia and Kiran lingering souls etc. feel free to cut the black splash and go full retard on WRG.   Also you want to play  Coursers. Except your meta is very nongrindy but usually you have a solid Base of GBx. TT Courser just wins you games off the value in combination with your  fetches.

Waste Not itself is another wincon with this deck as you will often just beat down with zombies.

The red splash gives the deck some reach and the ability to close games much faster once you have the lock up. Blighting gives you  copies of cards that can  for  there hand and lightning bolt removes pesky creatures and can always go to the face. You get access to great sideboard cards as well.

Thing  and  and topdeck mode thing are probable not going to flip true but being that they clog up the board they naturally help the game go longer which is what a deck running creeping tar pits and cryptic commands wants to be doing anyway.

6839819,0,t1_d0rkwff,If a single blocker all by itself was enough to beat aggro decks the existence of Kitchen Finks Lingering Souls etc. would keep aggro decks from getting played in modern. Last I checked modern was an aggro format so Im going to assume a single blocker is not enough to beat aggro on its own. This guy certainly isnt as potent on defense as the other cards I mentioned.Aggro decks lose to Control decks when the control deck is able to actually interact with my threats and get the game to a point where Im ripping cards off the top and they have superior card quality and card advantage and can bury the aggro player in the attrition war while being able to close out the game in a decent timeframe. When you play something that doesnt do any of that then youre just going to get further and further behind in the game and by the time this guy is supposed to flip youre probably dead. Its not uncommon for burn to win games with no creatures on the board finishing the game out with a flurry of burn spells.In a typical UWx control shell this guy is not flipping until turn . These kinds of decks are not built to be playing  spells a turn so flipping this guy will take a while. The decks that can do that are cantrip heavy Delver decks. UWx generally plays one spell a turn until they have a lot of lands in play and thats the point when the blue player can cast  spells per turn. Thats the point where the control player starts locking up the game.You could argue that control decks start playing more  mana spells but the thing is those spells have very little impact on the board state! Serum Visions Probe etc. dont interact with the threats an aggro player is presenting so while youre spinning your wheels to try and turbofliip this guy youre falling really far behind the aggro player and yes all of your guys will be flipped and youll take . Then you finish the game with double boros charm and thats game over.This guy only wins the game for control decks when theyre already winning it doesnt help them win games that they were already behind in.,ModernMagic,d0rlip1,2,t5_2xs5t

6844691,0,t3_49gz2w,I play Temur Kiki and feel that this card will be a great addition to my list. Back when Twin was still a thing there used to be a great bluff that could be done by Turn  flashing in an Exarch with no intent to combo off with it. The result was your opponent would fear the worst and derail their own gameplan to remove it as quickly as possible. If all Thing in the Ice does in my deck is cause my opponents to overreact to it and force removal then its done its job tremendously. Just like a turn  Deceiver could easily mean that I have a Twin in tow playing this thing turn  with  cards in my hand can easily represent a turn  or turn  flip. While my deck is heavily creature based many of them are flash creatures Krasis and Snap or have a beneficial ETB effect Huntmaster. The only creatures Im running that dont are JVP which can flip pretty easily in light of the multiple InstantsSorceries needed to flip Thing and Tarmogoyf which is still good enough to risk the nonbo. Im happy as hell this thing exists and while I do think the card asks a lot more of the decks that want to fit it in than people are currently thinking Im looking forward to giving it a home. ,ModernMagic,d0s5h7r,2,t5_2xs5t

Exactly it doesnt.What did happen however was that Pod was becoming too strong an enabler for creatures that made it into the format and rather than banning cards like Siege Rhino they went after the card that would have the least splash damage Birthing Pod.,ModernMagic,d10omw2,0,t5_2xs5t

6980636,0,t1_d1768wr,This is a copy of my post on the mtgsalvation jund forumI dont play a completely standard jund build as I jam  oath of Nissa. I cut two lands down to  maelstrom pulse and a four drop. My creature suite is goyf dark confidant x scooze x kalitas and two abbot of keral keep. Sry for not adding a formated list but Im on mobile and dont know how to.I shaved down on the  drops because I wanted to play this deck a little more aggressive. Abbot plays nicely with oath of Nissa and the lower manacurve dont wanna flip  drops with abbot but another abbot or oath of Nissa is really nice.Mainly Im writing this because of how awesome oath of Nissa is. I think it doesnt get enough respect. some people brought it up in this thread but it was dismissed instantly. I think the arguments why it has been dismissed are not correct at least partly.I want to emphasise that Im no expert and therefore dont know if the standard jund list is just better. I just want people to give oath of Nissa a chance and test with it.One of the arguments against oath of Nissa was that jund is a oneforone deck that has to rely on its topdecks. Oath would be a bad topdeck if we are looking for a removal spell.Thats just wrong imho. It just depends on what you cut for the oaths. As I listed earlier I cut  lands one removal and one creature in comparison to standard builds. So lets go through these options drawing oath instead of the cards i cut for it out of  times I would have drawn a land instead. In the early game this mostly means a tempo loss because I have to spend one green mana to find a land. The chance to draw a land is very high. Oath lets me keep onelanders as I can just search for my second land drop. Even if I miss with oath and only find a creature or even nothing thats three cards I probably didnt want to draw anyway in that situation. In the mid game the tempo hit doesnt matter that much and I get the option to find a land or a creature or lili which is nice. In the late game the card really shines. It turns a bad topdeck land into a threat!What if i brick with oath in the late game? Well If i have three lands on top i have to take a land. I would have drawn a land anyway  out of four times as i cut  lands. Without oath I would have to draw all three of them!What if I reveal three instantssorceries? Well this happens rarely and is really bad.But it seems like some people dislike oath because you have to put these spells on the bottom. It seems like they think its bad because sometimes we are looking for answers like terminate and now we would have drawn them next turn but have to bottom it instead.This is just false. This is like saying that mill cards are good because we could mill a card the opponent wanted to draw.One out of four times I would draw a maelstrom pulse instead of oath. Thats bad if I was looking for removal and bad if I can only find a land. But like I said before without oath I would draw this land anyway. I have to note that finding lili can act as the wanted removal. Most of the time I will find a creature instead of the maelstrom pulse. As I said in the beginning I wanted to play this deck more aggressively.One out of four time I draw an oath instead of a creature. This is fine as I will find a creature most of the time sometimes I even have a choice do I want Lilly or a goyf.In general oath provides a few other advantages. For one it is nice to grab the land of choice. Sometimes you can choose between blackcleave cliff or a manland. Without oath you just draw what you draw.Another point is its help casting lili. Blue moon is back in action and oath helped me a lot in this matchup even game one havent fetched a swamp but killed opponent with lili.,ModernMagic,d17le3m,1,t5_2xs5t

Feel free to send either of us a PM or just post in the MTGS thread.Im putting together a post regarding ideas for the future of the deck and changes I think need to be made but again feel free to PM either of us or just post in that thread.

Its like spinning a roulette wheel you wont always win so dont set your expectations too high but its always exciting. You can skew the odds in your favor though with good deck building.Kiki Chords combo is more like a finisher. Your Plan A is to value them out. This deck is the opposite you want to combo off as early as possible but if you dont find the combo or if the opponent wants to interact with your board then you go on the valuebeatdown plan.Just do the math  lands  dorks  Spellskite  AnaMelira  persist pieces  Seer  Witness  ChordCompany. Thats the bare minimum so  cards leaving you  slots to play around with. rd land Fiend Hunter more Seers Witness and Skites Scooze and Pridemage etc can be added as you like.I was skeptical of the ThuneFeeder combo at first but I ran it on my sideboard once and never took it out.

Restricting problematic cards in Modern just leads to more games being won on variance and its probably better to just ban them outright.I will say that restricting Eye of Ugin is a nice way of nerfing the Eldrazi deck while keeping Tron intact though as the latter deck only ran one Eye of Ugin anyway.,ModernMagic,d1k9kth,10,t5_2xs5t

7132266,0,t3_4d884i,When Faeries was originally a thing it had Ancestral Visions.  Thats a big loss.  The big issue though is the speed of the format around it.  When Faeries was dominant it was because T Thoughtseize into T Bitterblossom almost couldnt be beaten.  Look at the format now.  How many major decks do you want to spend your first two turns making those plays against?Eldrazi deck are going to run you over obviously.  AffinityZooBurn thank you for the lifeloss and kill you before you have enough faerie tokens to matter.  I havent played against lantern with faeries but I doubt its good.  You can spellstutter all their  drops but eventually theyll sneak a bridge through and then youre in trouble since Cryptic bouncing it is really your only answer.  Tron is going to run you over and laugh at your  fliers.  Jund was always the faerie killer with the big efficient creatures that just outclass your guys Tarmogoyf coming down before spellstutter is online to counter him is a big deal.Storm and Living End are good matchups so theres that.  Thats really the thing though.  Faeries at its heart is better against slower decks and decks that want to control the game because faeries will always just be better at whatever theyre trying to do.  Tron would be that if it werent for how fast their big stuff comes online often before youre prepared with Cryptic and the inevitability they get from Eye.  Also with all the little shit in the format you cant really afford to play  Cryptics like you used to.The best hope for Faeries to become a real deck again is for the banlist update tomorrow to do something that makes control a thing.

Wraths are a nombo and you need either a bounce or enchantment removal a resolved Stony Silence stops the combo and the win condition on its own. Blue Suns Zenith is way better because it wins on the spot at instant speed and can be flashed back with Snapcaster through a counter the same turn. you make  mana cast BSZ counter Snap BSZ or a counter of your own on the GY you can also Remand your BSZ ie vs a Dispel and cast it again is way more resillient.Ill add  Blue Suns Zenith  Snapcaster Mage  Cryptic Command to start get rid of the milling ad a second win condition ie Celestial Colonnade and continue from there.

There are too many expensive donothing cards in it while there is not enough interaction to beat any of the aggro decks that are now in the format.

7301794,0,t3_4fe57q,From a lot of reading articles and the different control themed forums on MTG salvation aswell as a fair amount of testing with proxies and xmage i feel differently than you.  In my opinion AV will be a auto include in any blue based deck that plans to go long wich is most of them.  Being down a card for  turns oftentimes is not that big of a deal since you wont be winning the game any time soon anyway and your main goal is survival.    vs Control  In a control mirror the deck with AV should be heavily favored in my opinion since there it is not only a insane early play but also a late topdeck of AV on a stalled out game can be back breaking for your oponent.    vs Midrange  Similar to the Control Mirror AV should be a huge deal in this kind of matchup especially vs atrition based strategies such as Jund Junk and Grixis midrange.  Being able to draw a entire new hand once it gets off of suspend undoing all the hand disruption that has happened before and having access to  new cards with all your mana untapped before they get a chance to take it apart with disruption is huge.  Not to mention the reliance on  trades by those kinds of decks.    vs Combo  Here AV should be very hit or miss.  Some combo decks will just be too fast for AV to matter in the best of times while in other matchups it will allow you to be more liberal with your disruption knowing you will be drawing  and refilling by the time you run out of interaction.    vs Aggro  This is similar to the combo matchup however with a higher chance of AV being a miss than a hit.  Vs decks such as affinity infect burn zoo etc you will likely not want AV in your deck however vs slower aggro decks it might come off of suspend just in time to refill your hand with removal in order to stabilize.  This has been my expirience in jeskai control mainly since the deck is full of cheep removal thus buying enough time for AV to matter.    My opinion is tainted for sure though since i want blue based control to work in modern thus getting my fair share of confirmation bias  and i beleve many other blue mages feel the same way ,ModernMagic,d285xku,2,t5_2xs5t

Im told BGX is still a great matchup for CoCo! That said I can tell you for sure that Burn is a great matchup with  main deck Finks. In fact a lot of unfair or linear decks feel like good matchups as it can be quite easy to shoot down their game plan with an early combo. That said grindy decks can be difficult. Not unwinnable mind you as CoCo is still great for grinding. It can just be tough to close out games against uw control decks for example.

7463728,0,t1_d2qkco9,Yes in a vacuum Dark Confidant is stronger than Kitchen Finks. But they perform totally different functions in the deck at different points in the curve. You can only run  of each at max and the situations in which you want to draw one or the other are varied. Frankly I just find your analysis of Merrow Reejerey to be pretty shallow. Sometimes we DO want to dump our hand. Sometimes we DO want to untap a Mutavault and attack after casting a creature. Sometimes we DO want to tap an opponents creature with Reej and bounce them with a Harbinger of the Tides. Reej is lords  which is crucial but hes also so much more. Yes creatures die to removal sometimes its true. Paying  mana does feel a little rough when he eats a Lightning Bolt. But many times on turn  with  mana available tapping out for Reej is going to be our best tempo play by far. If we dont have a mana spell such as Vapor Snag Spell Pierce or Dismember in hand how is paying  mana only to have Reej get bolted any worse than paying  mana only to have an Islandwalk lord get bolted? On top of all this well often be putting Reej onto the battlefield with a Vial on  on its way to  so upping our drops actually makes Aether Vial and our mana curve more efficient. ,ModernMagic,d2qkvpw,2,t5_2xs5t

CoCo in modern isnt going to restrict design for new sets. People keep saying that pod was banned because it restricted design space but this simply isnt true. Wizards did not say anything about that in their annoucnement only that Pod was performing too well and that it would continue to do so with newer creatures being printed.Now you could argue that CoCo might eventually become too powerful when more and more good  and  drops are printed but I think thats unlikely.

I just want to make your you know that this deck is not the most competative deck out there and has very poor aggro matchups. But if you are cool with that this deck is a blast to play and one of my favorites.  I personally would start working on a mono green version of Tooth and Nail  . That should help you get started. Besides that I would suggest getting all of the ramp cards first arbor elf uptopia sprawl voyaging satyr and overgrowth.  Then from there I would get the combo Xenagos and Emerkrul.  Seeing you already have genesis wave I would work on filling out the deck first eternal witness primal command harmonize gurruk etc. I would make sure you have the shrine to Nyx and Eternal Witness as those two in combo should generate enough mana that genesis wave becomes Tooth and Nail like. I would strongly suggest though getting the decks namesake though.     From there you should be able to customize the deck with what ever works for you.

Im really not a fan of playing scales alongside two other artifacts that need synergy at cmc and with the crucible already your land destruction abilities seem like a better route. You can up your removal to the cmc slot if youre worried about the disharmony with chalice. Lightning Helix is good against some of the faster aggro decks.

7901933,0,t3_4nh8x3,I guess I will give the counterpoints for Lingering Souls. I currently run Dredge Loam. My list is here  .I like Souls over Skaab for a few reasons. First the two bodies are pretty relevant against some of the more competitive decks like Infect and Affinity. Skaab comes into play tapped and thus cannot block the turn you bring it back. Yes you have other cards like Darkblast to help in these matchups but Affinity and Infect are top tier because they are consistent and can survive under hate. Souls just gives your less consistent deck more ammo.Second Souls is easier to cast. In most dredge decks black mana is easier to come by than blue. More importantly the two cards required to bring back Skaab can be quite prohibitive. Yes you can  do cool things with Amalgams but conversely the discard requirement really hurts when your neutralbehind your opponent.  This is especially true when you have mulliganed which this deck does more often than most.Finally I have found that Souls is a much better card for when the deck is just not cooperating and you need to play fair magic for a while. One of dredges biggest enemies is its consistency. Sometimes it just doesnt go off turns . Maybe you had some bad dredges maybe you never drew a dredge card. In these spots Id rather have a Souls in hand or in the graveyard.  spirits lets you put on pressure or buy some time. Yes maybe Skaab is the one card you need to return an Amalgam and discard a dredge card but in fair game scenarios where your deck isnt already going crazy Skaab can be a horrible top deck or alternatively a card that does little to stop your opponent from killing you.Nevertheless my perspective is different from those running gargodredge or dredgevine. Zombie Infestation is a constant discard outlet that is hard to deal with because its an enchantment. I dont run gravecrawlers so creature typing is less important to me. I also run Unburial Rites so I am aiming more for a turn  kill than vomiting  power on turn .,ModernMagic,d4492ul,2,t5_2xs5t

7947128,0,t1_d491bkl,I wouldnt say its the easiest way to win and it shouldnt be the only way to win. The only reason Nahiri works in this deck is because there are other avenues to victory. I always have to bring this up but you sort of play this deck like you played Twin before it was banned. Yes the deck has a combo win which your opponents will have to respect although the Nahiri combo is much slower and requires less respect but the respect in some magnitude is still there. But Twin and this deck doesnt need to combo off to win. It plays as a control deck and over time of building up mana lightning bolts helix and snapcasterclique attacks will build enough time to have the mana to start sending colonnade in and just doing incremental damage over time.,ModernMagic,d49bykc,1,t5_2xs5t

7977244,0,t3_4ofn4h,Kiki Chord takes a lot of practice and even though testing on platforms like xmage and Cockatrice do help in familiarisation I would take a lot of the testing done on them with a pinch of salt since a lot of the decks that people play on these platforms tend to be decks that are less ? competitive. Meaning youd tend to see less of meta powerhouses like Jund Junk Abzan Company Jeskai Nahiri Scapeshift Burn and the like as compared to in paper where the majority of people tend to build decks that can put up competitive results and win games. Practicing with Kiki Chord is more than just a matter of months Ive been playing it close to about a year now and Im still not confident in saying that Im piloting it to its full potential just because there are so many lines at any point in the game that might lead to a different end result.

But youve already tried this and I suppose aside from the combo finish it plays a fair game much like Jund does. If you want something linear Id suggest Merfolk. Playing blue is very fun and you get to run a very creature dense and aggressivetempo deck. I suppose it does depend on your budget and what pieces you already own vialscaverns are pretty expensive.

8016327,0,t1_d4gvbjv,New Emrakul is best compared to new Ulamog not old Emrakul. There is a big difference between  mana and  mana. For decks like hypergenesis that dont care about cost at all old emrakul has always been and will continue to be the best choice. however For decks like Tron that center around getting into that  mana range new Emrakul and old Emrakul arent really competing for the same spot. New Emrakul and new Ulamog take the roll of thing you slam down shortly after completing tron aka your mid game turn  and old Emrakul takes the role of late game finisher aka turn . Current tron deck dont really run old Emrakul becuase they dont need something in that slot and would rather have things they can slam down faster.

Also I think a lot of people forget how powerful Mindslaver is and it works even if shes countered!... I mean hell you can see their sideboard! Thats awesome! Plus considering you can feasibly cast her for way cheaper. I think a lot of people see a card that isnt strictly better than other cards and dont realize that potential comes in vast forms.

8070442,0,t3_4pqy3g,Of course. Theyre all  completely viable. Temur Scapeshift has the strong Control Points. You dont have to worry much about color fixing so you can focus on more Control spells. The Temur version is the most controlling out of the  and is the closest to a true Control Deck.BTL Scapeshift has the BTL Package that makes it stronger with Silver Bullets and consistency. The Deck has to remove some of the Control power by adding Black or White and not running as many Temur Control spells. So the Deck gets slightly less powerful overall. However BTL makes up for this by being more consistent with finding Scapeshift. BTL also gives you essentially  copies of any Silver Bullet you choose to run.  Cards that find Crumble to Dust  Cards that find Wrath of God makes it much more likely that youll find the Silver Bullet you need to win the game.RG Titanshift is the straightup combo Deck. It sacrifices all aspects of Control for faster Ramp. In doing so you Goldfish a Turn  kill about  of the time. Between  Scapeshifts  Primeval Titan  Vakaluts and  Mountains Titanshift is the definition of uninteractive. If your opponent isnt interacting with you youre probably winning the game.,ModernMagic,d4n6zzg,6,t5_2xs5t

Plus the lack of lifegain from Timely Reinforcements and Sorin is horrendous against Burn and Affinity. Plus Emrakul is a floating brick and when you draw him and not Nahiri which happens more often than youd like since the deck has zero card filtering outside of Nahiri herself you are losing already nonexistent card advantage. The token beatdown plan doesnt work all that well when you have only  anthem effects no zealous persecution no sorin no gideon and youre not even running the full suite of token generators only  blossom  spectral  timely. While Nahiri does help against Tron it makes so many more matchups worse that shes absolutely not worth including at the cost of the decks consistency.

I also touched on my concerns about playing Leaks and Remands instead of Dispels and Snares in the post as well as my thoughts on Pyromancer...Point being I dont see a reason that this aggressive build for Delver is worse than a traditional build. Once I gave Homunculus a try I knew the deck needed a shift towards the aggressive to fit the strategy that Homunculus pushes for.

8215702,0,t1_d544y95,Well yes but with that logic then the difference between a playset Tarmogoyf and   dollar bills is that literally any person in the WORLD will accept the bills and acknowledge their value whereas tarmogoyfs really only have value to members of the MtG community. Now Im not trying to say that I need other people to acknowledge the value of my possessions for them to make me happy but I do think theres something to be said for that when you look at it in terms of of the value of a tarmogoyf vs the value of a dollar bill. Not to mention tarmogoyfs are much easier to counterfeit but thats a whole different can of worms and I am not going to get into that. Sure it can be said that value is subjective and I very much agree but its that subjective aspect to value that has made me decide for myself that independent from how good they are Tarmogoyfs dont have enough value to me personally to make them worth their price. Others disagree because again value is subjective and they think that a playset of goyfs will in fact give them  which if were realistic is probably closer to  or  worth of happiness and so they buy themselves some goyfs thats perfectly fine. Everyone sees the world differently and makes different decisions for different reasons this is just one of the many examples of that.,ModernMagic,d54in8n,1,t5_2xs5t

You need so much black mana to make this deck work it often fails to do its job. Mana con city of brass should be what you use to hit  lands you should run  bonus attack phase cards there should be  griselbrand in both the main and sideboard and finally glittering wish should be researchdevelopment. Also  omniscience isnt good either. Having one out doesnt do much with a lot of the cards in the deck  is plenty. Plus that sideboard can be streamlined way better. Leyline of sanctity gutteral response and Boseiju are good. Plus a cheeky  of biovision means you can beat someone with infinite life.

8365219,0,t1_d5n3nc7,Ok so sideboarding with this deck is weird. What to bring IN is always very simple. What to bring OUT is the problem. So let me preface this by saying I dont have a card for card guide as I usually go by feel. But this is generally what you wanna do. Leylines are for hand disruption decks burn and decks that wanna one shot combo you like the mirror or Scapeshift.Darkness is for Infect Zooicide and Affinity. They have moderate usefulness against aggro decks that arent these three burn merfolk etc but your aggro matchup is so good I dont think its very necessary. Boseiju against blue decks. Seems fairly obvious. Hurkyls against Affinity and Lantern. Again pretty straight forward stuffBring in one echoing truth against EVERY deck. Then if you see a bunch of permanent based hate game  bring in the other one game .Slaughter Pact should be in the main imo. Gives you a simple out to Spellskite and the slim chance of interacting with Infect game Pact of Negation against blue. Some cards that I feel like should be in your sideboard somewhere include Patricians Scorn and Gigadrowse. Scorn is a simple out to Leyline that doesnt require you making  extra mana for Echoing Truth and Gigadrowse has a bunch of random usefulness  tap down blue decks lands tap down creatures etc.What to take out depends on matchup ofc. Here is a quick guidePact is out against not blue decks. However I like keeping one in just in case they try something silly mid combo. Again that depends on matchup thoughI like taking out some number of Unlifes and Pentad Prism against Abrupt Decay and K Command decks respectively. Prism might also be a cut against Spell Snare decks. Lotus Bloom comes out vs remand decks. I always cut lands when I bring in BoseijuSpoils comes out against aggressive decksI also sometimes trim a land even if I dont bring in Boseiju if its a fast matchupCutting a Simian Spirit Guide is acceptable in slower matchups. Only  though no more. Angels Grace Serum Visions Ad Nauseam are untouchable. Sleight of Hand is pretty damn close to untouchable. Hope this was helpful. ,ModernMagic,d5n7chm,1,t5_2xs5t

Besides the synergy with Jace VP looting helps find or ditch combo pieces Jace flashes back Harmless Offering the combo is much more Thopter Swordesque than Twin. Just look at the direction Jeskai Nahiri decks have gone. People arent playing as much countermagic anymore and are instead opting for cards like Timely and Anger. Thopter Sword Nahirakul and Demeownic Pact are all combos that primarily trump fair decks and give you a shot against big mana. Theyre great win conditions against linear decks once youve actually established control over the game but I dont see the incentive to play it like Twin with a bunch of two mana countermagic and Dispels.

If blue is your splash color then you probably dont want two blue sources out at the same time or be forced to fetch into one and thin your mana field to a timely Ghost Quarter.That said.  Serum Visions will probably not be your T play in Mardu Blue.  It might just be some extra dig in grindier turns.  Black White seems to be your priority here with a red for Bolts.

8854661,0,t1_d7c3j2x,Id agree that burn is unlikely to see a ban but it is a little of a different case. Burn is the type of deck that tends to pick up small improvements over time as new sets come out more so than jund. As in burn wasnt really a tier one deck until eidolon got printed in theros and then it picked up atarkas command etc. In that same time of course jund got better as well but cards like k command and kalitas dont improve jund as fundamentally as those burn cards did for burn. I think it largely has to do with the fact that for jund they are looking to replace cards that share a similar role in an already powerful deck eg Huntmastergt Kalitas versus burn which is more linear and thus has more clear upgrades so that if something good gets printed it basically replaces the lowest power card and causes a larger increase in overall level. Like if something new got printed right now it probably replaces riftbolt and makes the deck overall more substantially better. ,ModernMagic,d7c7e0f,1,t5_2xs5t

8889440,0,t3_520d8b,Ive played with and against a fair amount of infect in both Legacy and Modern and heres a bunch of random factoids   You are half combo half aggro half tempo.  Most of your games will not be a combo finish on turn two or three but a slower chipfest of one to two damage a turn with an Exalted Inky or Blighted Agent or some combination thereof.   Save your Gitaxian Probes if you can.  They are most valuable when you need information about whether a kill this turn is possible.   Patience is important.  Dont start a fight unless youre reasonably sure you can win.  Know what removal your opponent has and what they can cast with their current board state and make sure you know your worst case scenario before going in on pump spells.   There are nonobvious advantages that patience will bring you such as you getting to choose what cards to trade for the particular removal spells your opponent has.  Good opponents will represent interaction during combat and execute or not on that threat on your end step.  Breaking the tension lets them choose the strongest removal for the situation while keeping the tension allows you to use the strongest defense.   For example if you fire off a kicked Vines early your opponent may have the chance to trade in a Gut Shot for it which is an great trade for them.  You want to be trading your less versatile spells like Blessings and Mutagenics for their removal.   Gut shot is a card you can expect out of sideboards in Modern which tends to complicate the above.  People who hate to lose to Infect may even have a Sudden Shock or two.  These cards are very good against you so keep them in mind.   Vines can target your opponents creatures if theyre doing their own pumpenchantment shenanigans.  This is important in the mirror match for both you and your opponent.,ModernMagic,d7gdv4a,5,t5_2xs5t

8982831,0,t1_d7rkzzb,gt Why is Wurmcoil so strong? I know it replaces itself but doesnt the deck either have problems with small decks that chumpblock or decks with heavy exile removal?Its important to be familiar with the concept of win more cards. Win more cards are cards that are only good if you are already winning and we want to avoid them.  When choosing cards for this deck we are looking for a certain number of big cards to win the game with our tron lands. But its important that these cards give us the ability to change a losing position to a winning one. Wurmcoil does this. Its almost impossible to attack profitably into a Wurmcoil and if they do have removal for it its even harder. So Wurmcoil can change a losing position to a winning one vs almost any deck that wins with attacking creatures very common. The fact that you can actually win the game by attacking with a  is secondary which is why we dont care about chump blocking. Wurmcoils role is to turn that losing position all those attacking creatures into a winning one. If they have Path to Exile its ok you just have to plan for it. Usually with Chalice on . Wurmcoil also has the added advantage of being easy to cast without the tron lands.  mana is not that much. ,ModernMagic,d7rlk3x,4,t5_2xs5t

9005562,0,t1_d7ubdhv,What a lot of people arent considering it seems is deckbuilding cost. Yes disrupting shoal exists but to play it you MUST be playing blue and you have to exile a card. Misstep doesnt care about that at all. You just pay life.Say Im playing infect on the play and I have a t glistened elf. Misstep can stop that. I have to play my own missteps now just in case my opponent is playing misstep. Pretty soon this ends up with a lot of people playing the card just to counter everyone elses missteps. Thats why it would be bad for the format. Things like counterspell shoal force etc have a deckbuilding cost that puts them into specific archetypes whereas misstep is playable by everyone. As Ive said in other threads about this we already have enough hate card drawing in modern. It is already a format defined by powerful sideboard and answer cards. I dont think what we want for the format now is to add on top of that the misstep factor as well.The card counters bolt path most of infect most proactive discard spells aether vial spell pierce loads of t zoo creatures deaths shadow noble heirarchs dispel and many others at pretty much no cost to the deckbuilder.Another question I guess to ask is why would you not play four?,ModernMagic,d7ubtoz,3,t5_2xs5t

Esper Charm is basically instant draw or discard.  Not a ton of main deck enchantments you are looking to hit.  But it is card advantage.  Geists are just going to be to slow.  The Shinzo interaction is neat.  But itll require a mana investment every turn and you dont want to be constricting your ability to be doing other things.Off the top of my head the things Id look at are adding  collective brutality.  Discard  Life gain  creature interaction is what you are looking for.  Same goes for the Blessed Alliance Id maybe fun of  to start.    Main deck should have at least  dismember.  If your only play is to dismember to not die on their turn  its well worth it.Really what you want to do is shore up the way to not die to the aggressive decks.  Kill everything that hits the table.  Elspeth is a great win con that very few decks can deal with when it hits the table.  Maybe look at reworking your fetches and up your land count. Also Id cut  flooded strand and add a marsh flats.

9040749,0,t3_5424ia,Magic at its core is a game that takes skill.  Theres going to be elements of skill involved in every game you play especially because they are best  with sideboards. However I have played A LOT of burn and I feel like youre overrating its difficulty a bit.  If youre familiar with Hearthstone Burn plays a lot like Zoo decks. At first it seems like the deck has deep decisions and complex lines but after running the scenarios enough times they become muscle memory.  Mulligan rules are pretty simple most match ups have must kill cards otherwise you dont bother.The other issue here is that burn is too good.  Youre turn  percentage is absurdly high with a reasonable chance to win on turn  a lot.  You can just completely ignore you opponent and still win  of your games.  Post atarkas command the density of powerful damage in the deck is too high combined with the damage people take from their manabases so in reality you can spend every spell that goes towards a creature on the creature and still come out with a pretty solid turn  or  win where your opponent playing their linear aggro deck wasnt even in the game.Now I have played some sweet postboard matches and Eidolon and Deflecting Palm do add some unique situations to the deck.  The density of Wild Nacatls and Lava Spikes is a bit too high though.  With the advent of Nacatl burn traditional standouts such as Leyline Spellskite Dispel nonfinks lifegain simply do not provide enough of a challenge for burn.  Your atarkas commands lava spikes searing blazes skullcracks and revelries ruin skite postboard. Some of those combined with creatures ruin Leyline. Access to  crack effects hurts trying to utilize lifegain.Burn is in a very very good spot in the meta and is the favorite in many of its match ups.  Thats not to say theres zero skill in the deck but when youre an advantaged turn four deck it makes winning a lot easier and thus you get the no skill complaints.,ModernMagic,d7yjyhh,9,t5_2xs5t

9071790,0,t3_54imi0, Fastlands is way too many.  While Delver decks arent slow having lands wtb tapped can be a death sentence on turns .I think Grixis Delver being weak to burn is a bit of a red herring.  Grixis Delver while maybe not favored has a winnable Burn matchup.  Turn  s and s greatly reduce the amount of interaction you have to draw because of the fast clock they provide.The main argument against Jeskai Delver in my opinion is that while you can make your Burm matchup better you lose percentage points in more matchups.As for your list it seems intersting but like I said too many Fastlands.  I might consider Soulfire Grandmaster over Seker becauss it doesnt have to attack to gain you life so it wont matter if it gets outclassed in combat.  Its also a fantastic topdeck late.,ModernMagic,d82a62n,8,t5_2xs5t
9074756,0,t3_54kn0c,Seems theres a lot of people who are getting to Ad Naus these days. Theres like  threads a day so it may benefit you to search for some to help you with your decision. Regardless Ill share some of my experience with you.Ad Nauseam is truly one of the more unique Decks in Modern. It is a combo Deck that relies on Angels GracePhyrexian Unlife combined with Ad Nauseam to draw your entire Deck. With your Deck in your hand you can now cast either Lightning Storm Instant Speed or Lab Maniac Sorcery Speed to win the game. Your combo is then protected by  Maindeck Pact of Negation to prevent your opponent from stopping the combo. It is worth noting that you need  mana with Grace or  mana with Unlife to perform the combo but the reason why the combo works is because Simian Spirit Guide gives you extra mana to cast your wincon. If Simian Spirit Guide is banned later today then Ad Nauseam will no longer be a Deck and people need to understand that. How are you casting Lightning Storm on Turn  without that  Extra Red Mana from Simians? You dont.A few things that I enjoy the most about Ad Nauseam Sometimes you can know the outcome of the match  turns before your opponent does. When you have an Unlife while sitting on an Angels Grace and your Lotus Bloom comes off next turn you know theyre dead no matter what happens. Its the only Deck where you can feel the most comfortable when youre at  Life. Theres nothing better than facing down Burn sitting at  or so Life and feeling  confidant that youve won the game. It definitely doesnt feel like other Decks in Modern.I will say sequencing is very important. Ad Nauseam definitely feels like a Last ditch effort kinda Deck. There are many games where buying yourself a single turn is all you need to pull out the win. There can be games lost where you literally needed to untap your lands to win. By planning your turns in advance using your mana efficiently and knowing when to aggressively use Angels Grace or Pact of Negation you can become a much better Ad Nauseam player.Another interesting thing about Ad Nauseam is there isnt really a stock list. Theres the Core of the Deck  Ad Nauseam  Angels Grace  Unlife  Serum Visions  Lotus Bloom and  Pentad Prism but the rest is all up in the air. Some people run Peer Through Depths Sleight of Hand Spoils of the Vault Mystical Teachings mainside Slaughter Pact. The sideboard always seems to differ from person to person. Every time I see Ad Naus do well in a Tournament the landbase seems to differ. Some people like Mikikoro Urborg Tolaria West Dreadship Reef. I personally run Scry Lands and Fast Lands but some people even like running Fetch Lands. Theres really a lot you can do to personalize your list from others. Ive seen people have success with a lot of different type of builds.,ModernMagic,d82mzwt,1,t5_2xs5t

Its odd because when you look at it there actually arent that many amazing instants that you can flashback in modern with him. Cryptic Command is my most frequent target as I am running three of them in the deck and while it does have a large advantage in more midrange matchups the Blue Moon deck normally can do a decent enough time stalling the game so you can chain them off and eventually take over. The other notable thing that I am running in my deck is Time Stop which may honestly be a little bit too cute but this card is something that comes way out of left field and people do not expect it. You can use it to exile spells and effects on the stack end combat before damage and also effectively take an extra turn by casting this on their upkeep.

9496140,0,t3_5au6mh,Red Burn  gt Merfolk gt RG Tron gt Splinter Twin gt RUG Delver gt UWR Geist gt Grixis Control gt UB Tezzerator gt DredgeRed Burn was my budget intro to the format. I won some games but lost most. Not much to really be said I didnt play it for long.Merfolk was my first favorite deck. I still enjoy the idea of Merfolk today but I just kind of...grew out of it.RG Tron was a similar thing. I was super hyped to build it and play it but the shine wore off and I eventually grew bored of it.Splinter Twin was my favorite deck I have ever played in Magic. I had every version built and my favorite was TarmoTwin. It had everything aggro control tempo combo and it was rewarding as satisfying to play.RUG Delver was my attempt to salvage what remained of Twin. It was fun for a while but without access to things like Daze or Force of Will there just wasnt much point in running RUG over Grixis.UWR Geist was a deck that I build just because I already had most of it built. I took it to a few tournaments and had some fun with it but ultimately I grew bored of it.Grixis Control was fun but I didnt get to play with it that much.UB Tezzerator was built out of desperation to do something with the then newly unbanned Sword of the Meek. I liked how the deck worked but it wasnt that satisfying to play.Dredge is my most recent deck and the one I think my Modern career is stopping at regardless if it stays legal or gets banned into oblivion. After playing UXx for a few years Ive realized that I simply dont like the options that blue has in Modern and that its much easier to play a fast aggressive deck than it is to jam a control deck with an assortment of answers in hopes that I can hit something and dont get stuck with a hand full of the wrong  counterspells at the wrong time.Theres also just something about the act of dredging that is very satisfying. Sometimes its your birthday and you find a Narcomoeba with three Prized Amalgams. Other times you just get a smack in the penis.

9508764,0,t3_5b03d1,I say this in practically every thread about the state of Modern so here I go again. In a balanced healthy metagame everyone gets to play something they enjoy and everyone has fun. From the way that Wizards has been managing Modern they either actively dont care about it or actively want it to look like Standard where people dont have to face decks that require coming to terms with the concepts of card games.Ban x to make x more viable or x is too strong we need x doesnt happen in a balanced format like Legacy because with equal representation across the archetypes ban x to make x better just becomes bitching about matchups.Aggro enthusiasts that love Modern as is and dont want combo or control to have strong tools are literally just saying I dont like decks that can fight mine or I dont understand what that deck is doing or how to fight it it must be broken pls ban.As it is anyone who enjoys combo or control are just going to be steadily forced out of the format and as Standard has been equally homogenous and Legacy isnt getting any price support forced out of the game all together. That isnt healthy.,ModernMagic,d9l5off,2,t5_2xs5t

9509926,0,t1_d9laaqz,Yes I have. Ill speak with normal words but where I was top tables were usually nearing  Twin variants. I dont know if the deck was too strong but I do feel that the meta has become more diverse since its banning.So while I dont think a deck of its power level would have been banned in say Legacy power level relative to the field that is not sheer power level. I do think that in a more heavily moderated format like Modern it was healthy to ban it.I also wasnt insinuating anything. I said I disagree with unbanning it. Thats really got nothing to do with insinuating anything. Theres a whole host of other cards that everybody yells about for every BR announcement which I also disagree with. Modern is a format where Id rather have a few too many cards on the banned list than one too few. Which is my opinion. As I said youre free to disagree. But trying to belittle me is a lousy way of disagreeing with me.,ModernMagic,d9latl9,14,t5_2xs5t

9534482,0,t3_5be42q,If youre priced out for the Guides Id ask some friends. I know my local MTG community is pretty good about lending cards for bigger events. Youll probably have a better showing with burn even with less experience playing it as long as youre already familiar with the deck are decent at magic and are familiar with how the top modern decks work. With that being said play whatever deck youre going to enjoy yourself the most with and that you feel you have the best chance of not beating yourself with. If you think youll make too many mistakes with burn play bogles. Youre not just going to fold because you have bad match ups with some of the more popular decks in the format. Modern is extremely diverse at the moment GPs have a large number of players and no matter what deck you bring someone is going to be playing your worst possible matchup. I think almost any deck thats established has the ability to take down a GP right now its just a lot harder with some than others. I think burn is one of those decks that will have an easier time getting through day  and boggles will have a harder time. Both can do it and both can fail to make day .,ModernMagic,d9obodz,1,t5_2xs5t

Delver decks are most commonly built to be a consistent tempo style. Landing a threat protecting it and all while knocking your opponent back on their heels. Path to Exile is great for removing problem creatures but i think giving them the extra land is a little counter intuitive to your game plan.

9715720,0,t3_5e7vyb,Combo aggro decks are Infect Burn Affinity Dredge and any deck running temur battle rage.  These decks tend to have great game one percentages because they have a really powerful and fast way to win that is not easily interacted with.  The weakness of these decks is if their combo engine is disrupted they dont have other ways to win reliably.Card quality aggro decks are midrange decks and these are Zoo hatebear red deck wins skred eldrazi jund junk mono green aggro pretty much anything with goyf is midrange.  These decks all land somewhere between disruption and speed.  Jund is an example of the disruptive end of the spectrum it needs to stop the opponent before it can start winning.  Vanilla zoo super low curve sleigh deck is an example of the speed end of the spectrum.  It wants to remove the opponents blockers and punch them in the face with the most aggressive creatures in modern at  cmc.The best aggro deck right now is affinity but it is also the second most vulnerable aggro deck to disruption aka sideboard hate.  If you dont mind scooping to sideboard cards then affinity and dredge are your best options.  If you want to play interactive games of magic and still be aggressive then infect is the best choice.  If you want to grind your opponent down to nothing then jundjunk is the best option.If you want to get all the chicks at the mtg store then zoo is your best choice.  Zoo is also the best deck anyway so you should be playing this if you have any self respect.If you dont want to admit to your friends that you played mono green aggro last week you should pick a real deck.Good luck!,ModernMagic,daao8pd,2,t5_2xs5t

9734981,0,t1_dacyhnx,You can thoughtseize the Eldrazis. The problem with countering Bant Eldrazis threats is Cavern of Souls. You cant keep all your counters in postboard.I think both decks can play the tempo and the midrange game well. Delver is better at tempoing and Jund better at grinding obviously.Im propably a bit biased because I love the grixis colors and Delver Decks so dont take it too serious.I think Delver is the more flexible deck. For example sometimes you have to play really aggressive for two turns and then decide to play the grindfest for the rest of the game or just another two turns. You have to switch constantly your roles in a match and that and all the instant speed things you can do makes it a harder deck to pilot and master. Jund will give you good results earlier.If you love Tarmogoyf you will love Tasigur. He is not that consistent of a threat but can be much better also much worse. Casting Tasigur for B and quickly activating him on the same turn should feel pretty good.Also the Grixis Delver vs. Jund matchup is slightly favorable for Delver I wouldnt touch sultai. There is no established deck and the pressure on your graveyard is tough. Also playing Delver and Snappy without Bolt seems wrong.,ModernMagic,dad1rhu,2,t5_2xs5t

9744490,0,t3_5epiiz,Well the discussion comes to a point when you look at what Shardless agent can cascade into Ancestral Visions Serum Visions Goyf Scooze Jace VP just in those colors but most likely also Thoughtseize IoK Abrupt Decay or Dark Confidant because Black could be the best third color in this shell. Do you feel like cascading into spells like these would be too good? I think the biggest problem with the card is that it cascades into CMC lt  so you really streamline your cascade threats unlike BBE who becomes much more random when you can cast any card in your deck off of a cascade trigger you know? Add baleful strix to the same equation and you get another fantastic target for a Shardless cascade. But speaking about Baleful Strix on a seperate note I think it would be great for modern. Its powerful enough to keep decks like Eldrazi in check with the added benefit of helping an archetype like BuG form. I think it is powerful but not overly so and adds diversity to the format. ,ModernMagic,dae7y2q,14,t5_2xs5t

No victim of night is at its all time weakest rn because dredge and Viscera Seer and terminate is almost strictly better Consume the meek? another slow sweeper that grixis has better options for LotV leyline and lilli? grixis has no problem running either. If you want to play it at FNM level sure its fun but theres a reason Grixis is topping GPs and UB is nowhere to be seen I know i sound harsh but you have to realized with fair value based decks Jund Junk Jeskai Grixis etc. almost every idea has been explored and the meta has settle on specific decks because those decks are the highest powered after years of different people experimenting unless you are exploring a unique strategy recent examples include Dredge Lantern Amulet Titan Suicide Zoo you are almost never going to break open the meta with some new top tier deck.

9793864,0,t3_5fh94i,Clique is pretty good but between the hand disruption you already have and the threats that are available I dont think it warrants a slot.Speaking of hand disruption I think you should leave your Inquisitions and potential Thoughtseizes in the sideboard. You want a more linear gameplan for g and you do this best by forcing your opponent to invest mana in a card before answering it to gain a tempo advantage. Abrupt decay does this job well as do Leak and Remand. There are definitely things you want them for probably Thoughtseize more than Inquisition but not in most games I think.I highly recommend Nameless Inversion over Peppersmoke. Even if you DID run Clique the chance of drawing both singletons looks really low to me. Inversion can also act as a combat trick that pushes damage on an unblocked fatty. I think theres a way to build the deck so that you have enough blue cards for Shoal. Maybe try Psionic Blast so that you can hit cmc cards? Also gives you reach and extra removal.,ModernMagic,dakb0r3,2,t5_2xs5t

Anything else we can play around.   Ehh...three surgicals and one anger is nice. Though I think an second anger would help you out much more than  Kalitas. Kalitas is so slow youve probably lost the game by the time you play him.   Id bring out the Darkblast most likely since it doesnt have many targets against Grixis Control. Against Grixis Delver Id probably leave it in. Id shave one copy of Conflagrate but probably no more than that I play  MB.really though its sort of hard to discuss since dredge sideboards vary pretty drastically.

People might pick decks like Eldrazi Infect and Dredge because they can do well with them at an unknown meta they can be hard to play optimally but your meta choices wont make or break the deck unlike control.I love controloriented decks. Jeskai Grixis Kiki Chord you name it. I can do well with these decks because the Modern format is about knowing your deck well first and foremost.Please can we start thinking about this logically? The sky is not falling. Modern is a fun diverse format for so many people and the only thing spoiling it is people like OP acting like it isnt.So leave if you want but if you seriously think the opinions of random internet strangers are what will cause you to make the fairly radical financial decision of selling out of Modern then you need to reconsider.Can we go back to constructive discussion on this subreddit for once?

There are really  things to do with itall of which become obvious once you get oriented with the deck and basically when you know your opponent is going to kill you. The last two come up much less frequently for meand I dont really recommend them I do recommend mostly using spoils when you must in the order I presented them. I myself will often NOT take a spoils line if I think I might just naturally draw a card Im looking for or when its really not clear what Im looking for. You kind of have to remember your scrys and consider the  chance of out possible outs.. Spoils on or before the turn you absolutely must to find ad nauseam more rarely youre looking for an unlife or grace since its more likely that you have one of those in your hand already. . Spoils with your combo already assembled and on the stack for a pact of negation. . Spoils on opponents EOT for a simian spirit guide to go off on your own turn.  . Spoils because you scryed already and know whats on top and want it in your hand.. Spoils to bait out out a counter because you have an unlife in play and a winconenough simians that you know you wont kill yourself. . Spoils with a lab man out and a white combo piece to win the game once you draw a card most easily on upkeep before your draw or with another blue mana up to serum visions and draw a card.

In my mind Affinity has historically been the kind of deck thats either  or  in a matchup that uses the board to skew things in their favour in spite of any hate that people might bring in. The main power of the deck to me is that its so damn consistent with the kind of board presence it develops each game. You dont get mana screwed or mana flooded as much as other decks do either.

10177426,0,t1_dbxhv03,Like I said there is much work to do to find a refined list with proper distribution of disruptionremoval now so I cant give you a positive answer but I have been noticing a curious fact happening between IoKTS and Collective Brutality. The decks you want to use the  mode of Brutality against are not the same decks you want to use the Sin Collectorlike mode against. And the situation you most want IoKTS are not the same situations where you want . Then I think the flexibility of Brutality in conjunction with a new piece of  CMC interaction can be enough to cut down on a terrible topdeck card to give place to a more flexible one while still keepimg a core of hand disruption. But I am not sure of this and my assessment can very easily be incorrect. Only testing can tell. But about Push especifically I think at least  is a correct number to test because as a of you wont get consistent data on the card. But if you have the courage and opportunity to test on a fairly competitive setting like FNM I would recommend you to give a run with a full set. Maybe even cutting a Bolt for it. That way you could have a better perspective on which cases the card is better than other alternatives and which cases youd rather have a Bolt or Terminate instead. After a bit of testing like this you would have a better notion of how many to play. But I stand by the original comment I believe in decks with access to BR and considering the meta as it is now the correct amount of Push is probably going to be . ,ModernMagic,dbxo1ck,3,t5_2xs5t

10245431,0,t3_5mouuo,Top  overrated IMO. Engineered Explosives  Great sideboard card but people are getting a bit carried away putting it in their main deck. Its too dead in too many matchups.. Kalitas Traitor of Ghet  A lot of Jund players now treat it as the drop but I dont think it quite deserves such a near unanimous vote. The graveyard hate ability was awesome when Abzan CoCo was popular but now Dredge is the premier graveyard deck and its too slow to matter most of the time. Its also the easiest for control to deal with and Id rather have Huntmasters immediate lifegain against Burn.. Mox Opal  Overrated in the sense that people are always calling for it to be banned on principle because its free fast mana but really its a pretty strong but fair card with a reasonable drawback.. Grafdiggers Cage  Less powerful than a lot of people think against Dredge especially if youre playing a fair deck. It doesnt actually do anything to their yard so when they find an answer for it they are free to do whatever. Also you can lose to giant hardcasted Trolls!. Nahiri the Harbinger  Not really as overrated any more but earlier this year people were seriously delusional about the power level of this card. SCG had an article predicting it would be banned some people were saying it was better than JTMS etc.Underrated. Elvish Visionary  This card is super broken. Stoneforge Mystic is banned because its a drop that creates card advantage immediately even if removed. I dont know why people are constantly begging for a SFM unban when Elvish Visionary is a better version of the card thats currently legal. It can be buffed with Pendelhaven unlike Stoneforge and the random card it draws you is no doubt going to be better than whatever equipment you could tutor with SFM because ya know Kolaghans Command is a thing.. Ravenous Trap  People are starting to catch on but I think this is the best hate card against Modern Dredge.. Night of Souls Betrayal  One of my favorite sideboard cards I dont think it sees enough play for how ridiculously strong it is in multiple matchups. Gifts Ungiven  A card with a ton of raw power that nobody has managed to build a good deck around yet.. Grim Lavamancer  Another sideboard card that I think should get a little more consideration in Jund and other decks that can support it.,ModernMagic,dc5dk8k,7,t5_2xs5t

10300446,0,t1_dcaszdl,thanks for the feedback i will try to pay more attention to avoiding these sentence monsters which i am a bit prone to falling into i occasionally have the habit of getting into these ranty and longwinded clusters well yeah the standard changes are more significant and more extreme which is why i could contribute more there than to the modern changes. but the take away there is which i think i also pointed out in the article that the changes mostly affect zooicide variants and infect especially and will likely not kill but significantly weaken those strategies and give the format more room to breath again. therefore i dont expect to see HUGE changes to the format simply dredge fading out and the mentioned decks decreasing in dominance and popularity letting various slower decks flourish again. i am sorry if that is too unexciting or anything but i really think there is not much else to say regarding how modern changes after the bans imho. the probe ban was pretty surgical and nuanced of an adjustment and troll just needed to go so people dont need ot start their sideboards with  dredge hate cards to have a shot as it has always been with a viable dredge variant legal.,ModernMagic,dcbm0mp,0,t5_2xs5t

10363218,0,t3_5odxxh,I think this is a pretty heavy overreaction to Fatal Push. If people are running more removal cutting Nacatl might be right as some people suggested. This give you the option to consider more Copperline Gorges and Inspiring Vantages for nice smooth mana with no regard for Plains and Foreststhough this might not even be right if you have Lavamancer and Searing Blaze. In cheap removalTarmogoyf infested metagames cutting Nacatal can make sense Goblin Guide and Eidolon of the Great Revel on the other hand are too good. You are replacing the two best creatures that burn decks have ever seen with a  mana sorcery that does zero damage. Sure sometimes you will play Goblin Guide on the draw and it will flip your opponent a land and then get Pushed without dealing damage. The exact same thing happens with Lightning Bolt  which has always been one of the best and most heavily played cards in the format  now and people arent cutting Guide now. The fact that Eidolon trades oneforone while still dealing them damage is one of the reason it is so good. It has always died to removal but playing less than  in a burn deck seems like insanity to me. If people are going to be playing pileofanddrop Dark ConfidantSerum VisionsFatal Push decks it is a great threat and it does huge piles of damage against Infect and other decks that cant get it off the table. TLDR Eidolon and Guide are the second and third best cards in the deck after Lightning Bolt dont cut them. ,ModernMagic,dciqdep,5,t5_2xs5t

Ive never played and I wont play twin if it gets unbanned but I have always loved playing against twin. It always felt like the match came down to who played better and I would be content with losing because I knew it was my fault and I learned from it. If youre idea of fun is goldfishing instead of playing Magic then yes youd get crushed by twin. But thats your fault for thinking magic is a player game. Or you simply dont know how to play against control in which case fucking learn to play against control. If you dont understand their game plan and you play into it you should absolutely fucking lose that game. Just like every. Other. Deck.While I do think banning twin was probably correct I think comparing it to Eye of Ugin is laughable. It is nowhere near eye in terms of raw power. I would bet actual money that twins top  percentage had more to do with a large chunk of the playerbase identifying with that style of play rather than being some monster that cannot be defeated. Twin rewarded skill and game knowledge more than any other deck. It would be make sense that if the best players played the most rewarding deck for skilled play they would make a lot of top s.But while that is hypothetical and cannot be proven I will say that the fact people playing against twin should immediately tip you off that it is not the same and Eye of Ugin or summer bloom. If you are claiming that anyone enjoyed seeing T Eye on their opponents board Im calling you a fucking liar. Or delusional maybe.

10398777,0,t1_dcmpwu5,I suppose the only perfect way to test it would be to organize a few big tournaments where people can build either with new modern or old modern and see how the meta evolves over a few tournaments. not really a realistic approach though.My suggestion would be to keep the original idea the same Test the top decks of different years against each other. However you should allow those decks to have different configurations and sideboards when playing against different years  Allow the newest tron version to play maindeck spellskite and SB rending volley against the twin matchup even though tron hasnt played those cards since twin was banned. Allow decks a few SB slots with graveyard hate against the current and past dredge decks. I dont know how goodamppopular Eggs used to be but allow some sb hate against them depending on how much sb hate they used to be up against.I suppose one way to do it would be to look at what SB cards similar decks from that age used to pack and allow a similar SB. Thus for the matchup of current tron vs old twin look at the configuration of hate from old tron and build new tron in a similar way. For the matchup of old storm vs new Control Look at what cards old control had against storm and allow a similar build and look at what is currently played by storm as protection against control and allow similar cards in the tron sb.Its not going to be perfect but at least youre not going to have blowout twin wins because no deck packs hate for it anymore ,ModernMagic,dcmrngm,1,t5_2xs5t

10477543,0,t3_5q26wh,I guess dismember is the most important phyrexian spell. Its ban would harm decks that cant run much other instant speed removal like Infect  Affinity Living End Dismember was really an antitwin card there. Shriekmaw is better Mono green stompy Mono Blue Delver Bear and other fringe decks if Im not forgetting much. Deaths shadow is also probably not happy about it. Generally I think most decks that run white or black will simply play more whiteblack removal but nonblack decks that already run  paths might suffer. In addition Infect will be hurt by a Apostles Blessing ban but most of all by a Mutagenic Growth banVault Skirge hurts Affinity a little but not terribly so Id imagine?Noxious Revival is a card in some dredge builds and gifts builds? Surgical Extraction is significant as its a good card against combo decks played rather widely. Gut shot sees some play in certain fringe decks I guess. All in all I guess since removal gets a little worse a lot worse for greenblue decks and especially Infect gets slower I guess you could say that combo decks that use a creature in its combo would have an easier time but its hard to say since some players may choose to change to GB Infect with Fatal Push and stuff adding more removal to the format. Others may opt out of their removallight decks and go for a Fatal Push deck so Im not sure if the format will actually be removal light. Anyway thats my two cents.,ModernMagic,dcvqkw3,32,t5_2xs5t

10593742,0,t3_5rkkbs,What kind of plan are you looking at here? Granted AV is great but if youre looking at a drawgoflash type shell then Think Twice is the place to be so you get a mana sink and draw without having to wait  turns. Also if youre drifting towards Drawgo style play then you need to up your land count. Our plan in esper is not really the same as grixis.What matchups have you tested this against? I can see you having some issues with grindy matchups like any midrange or control deck jund abzan grixis. Like other folks have said Spell Queller is a great card but if youre on esper control and not like a tempomidrangey deck like Esper Trancendent or something like that then youd be better off playing the charms or Lingering Souls in its place. Lingering Souls is amazing for the grindy matchups too.Im curious why you dont have any sweepers mainboard too. Decks like these always have bad aggro matchups. I also noticed that a  split between pushpath is good because as games go on push gets worse. For land choices I find the  colonnade really interesting. Im also playing a  land list but Im playing  colonnade and no tar pits because theyre super boltable my meta is heavy on bolt and Esper has issues closing out games which is why I went with colonnade.That counter suite is very interesting. If it works it works but Im surprised that all the cryptics havent been a problem. I really dig the countersquall though.Has  Tasigur not been too much? I have a  split between Tas and Elspeth for my curve toppers and sometimes thats a bit much.Im curious about the AV. How many games T does it see a suspend? Also are you able to get your fastlands so you can do this? I purposely left fastlands out of my deck because it couldnt reliably get to my hand unless I aggressively mulliganed for them.

I would never advocate spending beyond your means but if you can justify the expense the cards are almost sure to hold theyre value since many are staples in legacy as well as modern like tarmogoyf and thoughtsieze. In addition these two decks are some the VERY few decks in modern that dont fold to sideboard hate which in my opinion is their best characteristic nearly every card is a powerful draw at any point in the game regardless of your opponents strategy. The same cannot be said of the blue control decks with serum visions and ancestral which are also very expensive.

The deck has a lot of disruption beyond that though.Now if you dont want to add that combo I would change things around in your list.

You need some more  drops and I would highly recommend some protection for your threats at least  Selfless Spirit and  Spellskite. Scavenging Ooze is good as well.

10765585,0,t3_5twvwe,You linked me over here from your post on rspikes and I like what youre working on. I have over a hundred matches with variations of this deck through competitive play MTGO FNM and testing so hopefully we can help each other out. Here is a link to the current list Im testingHere are some explanations for card choices please ask if you have any questions. CreaturesI was originally off of Pia and Kiran Nalaar but Ive come around to it and I think it may be a necessary card. In the Richmond Modern Classic I had a oneof Vendilion Clique that more than carried its weight. For Regionals I ran  V. Clique maindeck and they overperformed yet again. Snapcaster is selfexplanatory as it has great synergy with a significant portion of the deck and being able to pull the old BoltSnapBolt is a mainstay of URx decks.I played  copies of Guardian maindeck in Richmond I cut one for Regionals and I dont regret it. I always see plenty of cats.Manabase I think Ive nailed the manabase as I havent tweaked it at all in  matches. It has been unbelievably smooth. Lthouse has been invaluable. The interaction with the Checklands x Guardian is important and I had  in the maindeck  Glacial Fortress   Sulfur Falls but they caused some awkward opening hands that I was not fond of. SpellsIn Richmond I had  copies of Remand in my  and I ultimately came to regret it. On my way back I decided I wanted the core of my spell package to be x Lightning Bolt x Serum Visions x Path to Exile x Remand x Spreading SeasBuilding around these spells gave me  flex spots  creatures  Saheeli  lands  spells x Blessed Alliance x Spell Snare x Cryptic Command x DispelBlessed Alliance has consistently over performed and I will not leave home wo  of them. Incidentally they hedge against a lot of random matchups and with all of the jank decks to sift through the first couple of rounds of any event I have never found this to be an issue. Logic Knot has been on my short list for testing for a while and now Im going to throw  in the MD when I play it again.SideboardSee Leyline of Sanctity. I dont really like any of the Leylines they are a clunky but admittedly powerful effect. These come in against ANY deck with red. I have had multiple opponents that didnt expect the card just scoop to the T trigger. Saheeli gains a psuedohexproof and it is significantly easier to defend the combo because the sheer number of cards you have to be prepared for has been cut in half.At Regionals I played x Geist of Saint Traft out of the board. In control matchups I sided out my  combo pieces and brought in my Leylines and Geist to turn into a sort of Jeskai Geist Aggro deck like the ones we see pop up occasionally. I also tried  Sun Titans out of the board for an additional combo but I never actually was able to cast one. Oh well. Sorry for the lengthy response but there is a lot of data and this only scratches the surface. I planned to work on my own Primersideboard guidewhatever when I got the deck to a place that I felt it was consistently powerful enough and I think Im along with the collective effort of the internet close. I do want to say I was on Spreading Seas in this deck a month ago but I wasnt able to  a league and then have Ross Merriam post my list on SCGs homepage. Cue the violins lol.,ModernMagic,ddqe24r,6,t5_2xs5t
10766006,0,t3_5tz8ch,Its nice to see ModernNexus has started to get back on track with their metagame updates. A lot of it looks to do with the transition from Sheridan to Jason but hopefully these past two updates have shown they care about being consistent.Looking at the article the BampR update did do quite the number on the popularity of Dredge and Infect. While those decks are still playable Im guessing fans of those decks are now looking to Burn and Affinity to get their AggroCombo fix.Overall the metagame does look more cyclical than it did before the BampR update. The past couple of weeks have cemented Tier  into a RockPaperScissors metagame of AggroCombo BGx and RampBig Mana.But we can do better. Tier  right now is a conglomeration of a few narrow archetypes while it the past weve seen more diversity in styles of play. Your Corey Burkharts die hard Ad Naus fans or that one guy playing Eternal Command are showing up to events ready to battle but its hard to argue these decks are the cream of the crop.Less viable archetypes like Traditional Control AllIn Combo Tempo or ComboControl used to be Modern mainstays but now theyre regulated to more of the fringe. What world are we living in where Snapcaster Mage is no longer Tier ? And by now youd think Midrange could be playable without Green.This brings up a good question. Theres no doubt Modern can improve but how? The Salvation crew seems to think the answer is a lot of unbans but lets not go full Frontier here. We all know how alternate formats tend to go well except for Commander and Kamigawa Block Pauper Tiny Leaders.Maybe the answer is more bans? Hardly nothing has a stranglehold on the format and its not like taking an axe to the top performers is the best way to let the less viable guys come to fruition. Better answers? Sorry bud Control still blows if Counterspell is legal just like Sultai still sucks with Fatal Push around. The best approach is to look at the banlist look at Tier  and look at the archetypes that could use a boost.Unbans have been the topic of endless debate and quite frankly the discussions have gotten pretty stagnate. Its clear there are some number of cards on the ban list that make less sense than others and one archetype that tends to bring other long forgotten playstyles along with it. Traditional Control isnt viable without a less focused version of it to out grind. Tempo blows unless you have some slow and durdley deck spinning its wheels to disrupt. And we all know Ad Naus laughs in the face of trying to play a Flash game.We can do better by giving Modern some much needed ComboControl. It was the most controversial ban the world has ever seen and it would undoubtedly be an unban to go into the history books. rModernMagic what this format needs is a Splinter Twin unban.,ModernMagic,ddqfmhf,71,t5_2xs5t

10793460,0,t3_5u8zcq,Modern on the pro tour was bad for modern. Wizards basically said we dont like modern on the pro tour it doesnt help us all new sets like limited and standard pro tours do. Also we dont believe viewers like watching the same ish decks every year. The second point is what brought on the twin ban which many people were upset about. Full disclosure I wasam one of those people so Im biased. if you noticed modern bannings outside of TC and DDT always cant right before the PT in an effort to shake up the meta. This is very unhealthy for the format you cant just ban decks to force diversity. IMO the ban list should be as small as possible and only include cards that break the format. If you dont people get afraid. My local store owner built and foiled out pod bloom and eldrazi. He was afraid to buy into modern again he lost several grand over those bannings. Thats bad for the format if a large portion of the player base is afraid to buy cards especially if its justified. Whose going to buy the deck if its going to get banned for being the best deck? And no one buys it it wont get banned and the format is stuck with a broken deck. Look at pauper everyone knew Drake was busted. But no one built it because they knew it was getting banned. But after a few rounds of not getting banned everyone said f it I can either buy Drake or lose to it and thats how the first emergency ban in over a decade happened. Releasing it from the PT solved that but sadly it didnt stop bad bannings from continuing. I could go on about the probe ban but I think people who read this far are tired of an old man yelling at clouds.,ModernMagic,ddt9oyx,1,t5_2xs5t

You need to have the mana available when the opponent plays the spell.With respect to counterspell the trade off for not being able to answer any spells that have already resolved in later turns and needing to risk tempo by holding up mana is rewarded with a broader range of viable targets.Cards like goyf bob deaths shadow and cranial plating all win games if they arent answered quickly. Counterspell literally does nothing but for with these cards has no ability to win the game on its own is a dead draw when you are losing on board and it still has a more restrictive mana cost than them.,ModernMagic,deopawc,12,t5_2xs5t

I have no doubt Modern control decks could support . Id expect  at the minimum.gt Snap gets shut off by Scooze Kommand is clunky against BGx Cryptic is  mana and reactive and AV is trash if you cant slam it turn .Honestly question have you ever played the Grixis vs Jund matchup in Modern? Because if you had youd know that all the cards I named are very solid against Jund and that Grixis was favored. You dont have to take it from me just go read any of Corey Burkharts primers. I find the suggestion that Snapcaster and Cryptic arent good cards vs BGx to be laughable.gt If you can stick any  drop youre going to win unless they answer it in  turns. Huntmaster is a mini for that takes over the game and Raging Ravine is capable of doing  points of damage in  swings. Youre allowed to do powerful things in Modern.You can often afford to take multiple hits from a Raging Ravine before answering it. Then when you do youre back to parity. Ravine is also much easier to answer than Jace. I dont find that comparison worthwhile. It makes more sense to compare to a valuegenerating  drop like Huntmaster but even then you can deal with it and just spot your opponent a  Wolf token which isnt exactly going to run away with the game.On the other hand if you dont answer Jace right away youre going to lose to the insane card advantage he generates and your window to answer him will close very fast.Anyway Im tired of arguing about how powerful Jace the Mind Sculptor is with people who havent played with it in Legacy apologies if you have but thats the impression Im getting.

At best its basically a cryptic command or a stone rain but it has just always seemed underwhelming to me.If I was to play spell queller I think I would want to run like  and  restos and vendilion clique too. That card definitely makes me more of a midrange deck which is fine but another big reason I like the deck is because it blanks a lot of removal. Playing  creatures with flash really makes a lot of kill spells look silly. Spell queller kindof counteracts that and plays right into almost everything fatal push lightning bolt etc. It also is not a  for  which can be bad If i am trying to win with it.

I played TiTi in Suicide Bloo and its crazy good in this deck but sometimes it doesnt feels right nonetheless because of its controlly type due to the bounce if the games go fast you just want the raw power a Kiln Fiend provides so I thought it would perfectly fit into a deck with more interaction.I dont think Delver is strictly better here. Its also a bad topdeck and you want to cast your discard spells in the first few turns. I also dont like its flipping insonsistencies. You underrate Manamorphose probably.

11191844,0,t1_df0k9yd,Let me explain my position then.  At a fundamental level Tron is built in a very similar way compared to a deck like Titanshift or Amulet Bloom.  You have an engine in this case Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map in order to assemble a particular combination of cards in this case  Urzas lands which then allow you to effectively win the game through some set of pay off cards in this case some combination of Karn Ugin Ulamog World Breaker and Wurmcoil.  Similarly Scapeshift relies on combining  lands and Scapeshift or Primeval Titan and Amulet Bloom relies on combining  Mana with Summoners Pact or Primeval Titan.  Those cards are then leveraged in order to win the game more or less immediately.  Tron does it in a less obvious way but I certainly think it does it all the same.  Now if you look at how you beat these decks youll notice a certain similarity.  Primarily youre going to use land destruction and a threat.  I think that the degree to which Tron relies on a particular combination of  cards to win games makes it so its not really a control deck at all.  It has its largest similarities with land combo decks.  It does controlling things perhaps but the way it plays and the way you interact with it are most similar to those land combo decks I mentioned earlier.,ModernMagic,df0kz3j,7,t5_2xs5t

Your opponents will win the games for you also very often with their countless mistakes. Therefore if you have a good Day  deck against your percieved field on SCG Open which mind you are predictable from week to week if you do your homework then you will get placed well. It is nowhere close to GP Day MTGO. I dont think youve tried the deck if you say that this GW deck has mana consistency issues or actually analyzed why it would have any issues.The mana baseSource|G|W|U Saheeli|R Saheeli|||||Lands||||DorksOath||||Total||||You only need to fetch U and R lands if you are afraid of your dorks getting killed or if you dont have Oath of Nissa. If you have an Oath of Nissa you are free to curve out with only fetching GW basic lands. If you can afford it or dont need to curve out you can safely fetch Stomping Grounds end of turn to painfully hedge should you naturally draw Pia and Kiran.Everything you are doing the first turns costs you G or W. In contrast with Kiki Chord you must often be able to cast Bolt Paths Lightning Helixes Dorks or even your th splash color during the first turns. With Frank Karstens work on mana bases and what the optimal number of mana sources is we are at  to cast everything in our deck. Very painlessly.It is like night and day comparing the mana bases and it is one of the reasons I dont like playing KikiChord. The deck folds to itself too frequently partly because of the mana base.,ModernMagic,df1mcbg,-1,t5_2xs5t

Its completely reasonable for you to get it out and be able to crack it without ever getting tron mana due to spreading seas before Merfolk kills you. And once you do the spreading seas is gone and you are free to go to town. A resolved Ugin is also nearly impossible to beat but its much easier to get under that from the merfolk side of things.

11339321,0,t1_dfh6s3u,For the OP Id probably look to add an Engineered Explosives in the sideboard it helps in a lot of matchups. Also seconding the Collective Brutality recommendation card is great.Your sideboarding is pretty much the same as mine but there are a few things I would do differentlyAffinity OP has Zealous persecution which should definitely come in here cutting the third LilianaJundAbzan I would bring in the Damnation here as its one of the only things that can actually help you if you fall behind on board.Deaths Shadow take out a couple of Flayers  they are absolutely tiny in this matchup compared to Goyfs and Shadows. Bring in the Gideons instead  this matchup always ends in a grind.Grixis Control Id find some room for the two Finks as well since they cant exile it and its a resilient beater.Gx Tron I usually leave in the Decays since most of our creatures are graveyard based and Relic or RIP if GW Tron hurt. It also gets OStone and you can even snipe a Map with it if theyre careless. I usually cut a couple of Souls if Im against GR because of red sweepers and I dont bring in the Finks against GW because of Path and RIP. This matchup is so bad that I think its worth it bringing Surgical in just for the possibility that you draw it with Fulminator for an instawin.Eldrazi Tron Definitely wouldnt cut Decay here. Hits Relic and Map yes but most importantly always hits Chalice and Walking Ballista which are very problematic cards otherwise.Company For the Abzan version definitely leave in the Spellbombs and bring in Surgicals too to stop the combo.Storm I kinda like Liliana here. We have a lot of GY hate post board and if you combine that with a Liliana ticking up they are basically locked out of the game since their out to GY hate is going off from hand. I shave a couple of Souls which are slow. Maybe even bring in Damnation as additional insurance against the goblins.Ad Nauseam Decay stays for sure. Hits Lotus Bloom Pentad Prism Phyrexian Unlife Lab Man... Its even more important post board since you need a way to interact with their stuff if they start off with Leyline. Surgical is a good idea as well to pair with all the discard. ,ModernMagic,dfhaj6u,3,t5_2xs5t
11339351,0,t1_dfh6s3u,Was gonna make my own post but Ill piggyback off this one since I agree with  of it.Just a couple of things I disagree slightly withAffinity Id bring in Zealous Persecution for sure here its great in this matchup. Probably in place of the rd LotV.Ad Nauseam Not a fan of removing Decays in the matchup because they hit Phyrexian Unlife even through a Pact of Negation. Id keep them in over Thrun and Gideon and also Id rather have Surgical than Finks. With Goyfs and Flayers I think you already have enough ways to clock them and dont need to bring in the slower threats. Stony silence is pretty decent because it shuts off all their mana rocksLotus Bloom which buys you more time to draw into discard or kill them. Also Liliana the Last Hope is pretty much a dead card here unless you see them bring in Lingering Souls in which case shes worth keeping. And speaking of Souls I dont think I want  copies in my deck against a spellbased combo deck. So in summary I would sideboard like this against Ad Naus Thoughtseize Surgical Fulminators Stony Silence Push Path LtLH Lingering SoulsIf they have Lingering Souls postboard keep the LtLH in place of a Fulminator and bring in Zealous in place of another copy of Souls.Deaths Shadow This matchup gets pretty grindy so I want Gideon here for sure.

11356278,0,t3_622el4,Ive posted about this before but I highly recommend Dark Confidant or even Scavenging Ooze over Grim Flayer in Junk right now. Simply put I tried to make Grim Flayer work in Junk for about  straight months but you simply hit Delirium too slowly and too unreliably for him to make the list. You could try adding some Delirium enablers like Mishras Bauble and Nihil Spellbomb but they are sort of dead cards which is not really what you want in a midrange deck like Junk. If you do want to use Grim Flayers youre gonna have to make Junk into a semiZoo list. Throw in a bunch of goyfs oozes heirarchs and just throw a bunch of creatures at your opponents face. This is currently a pretty popular version of Junk right now look up some of the recent Junk lists on mtggoldfish but it personally wasnt my style.

How long will it take to get it in a playable state? Are you okay with waiting that long? Im not sure if theres a halfway version of junk but my Fae deck very gradually went from kitchen table to netdeck.

11620799,0,t1_dgd4b96,I think hes really implying that UW plays a bunch of cards that are more or less traps in Modern specifically. Across builds that includes Clique Spreading Seas AV although Grixis is its own beast D Sphere Crucible. Trap also includes the idea that running only two colors lets you run more colorless sources when Cryptic is the only intensive mana requirement any of these decks posses. Jace isnt a trap because its a card that should never see the light of day in any iteration of the format reasonably grounded in the card pool. Im also dismissing any UW list running mana leak but I assume for the sake of my own sanity and yours that those lists are abberant and immediately shut down by people with experience in the archetype. The cards that UW and Esper usually dont share that are left are essentially Gideon Jura and Elspeth as potential maindecks by buildboth of which specifically aid matchups UWx decks should already be winning except for Dredge in which matchup both are reduced to traps... One contributing only to losing slightly more slowly and the other being such a longshot that playing toward decking your opponent is more viable G. Edit To clarify Crucible is a trap in UWx but not necessarily universally in Modern. I think it can be serviceable in a deck like Lantern or help expand the axial impact of a generally medium but synergistic deck like Todd Stevens GW. ,ModernMagic,dgd88e2,1,t5_2xs5t

Having said that I think the DS ban is the safest and most reasonable. The drawback of the card is too easy to mitigate in modern with fetchshock thoughtseize and street wraith and what turned out to basically be a goyf in the right deck is a little too strong for modern. ,ModernMagic,dgdskve,1,t5_2xs5t

11641000,0,t1_dgfh994,None of this makes sense. Abzan Company gets to play more copies of Vizier. The effect is already useful for the Persist combo you can easily just replace one Melira if you like but youll see many preliminary lists cutting two Melira and one Anafenza because they feel the dual combo utility of Vizier makes it better than Melira or the second Anafenza.Both lists are known for playing Wall of Roots. As you said WoR is better but the difference is more or less painless.Its definitely not subbing eight cards. If the combo was marginal you only need to swap one Melira for Vizier one WoR for Devoted Druid and play one Duskwatch in a flex slot. Its subbing two cards and adding in one defensible card. If youre not impressed with the floor of Duskwatch in Company compare it to the floor of Vizier in Kiki Chord.I elaborate more in this comment but theres no need to set up a strawman and embellish the differences.,ModernMagic,dgfirce,5,t5_2xs5t

Sure it may take many turns on average to see the benefit but that average both includes games where the benefit is realized many turns in and those where it is realized sooner.  The follow up from that is if we are talking about does it make an impact ithe makes more sense to me to assume a game length and see how often it has an impact on the game rather than saying oh it takes  turns on average.

11668825,0,t1_dgin3db,People still lost games to twin without twin ever being cast. Tron is combo. It is literally a combination of cards which form together to do broken things. Nobody would argue against that since Karn is without doubt not meant to be dropped turn . However it IS possible to lose to tron without them assembling their combo too. They could pyroclasm into ostone survive a few turns and then crack ostone and play karnugin all without ever having seen their stars align. Furthermore when you assemble your tron combo you dont actually win on the spot. Maybe you dont even play something till  mana!Combo isnt defined by deck that wins on the spot. If a Magic player actually thinks thats what combo is then they are simply incorrect and need to readjust their mindset. What about gifts ungiven decks? Its entirely possible for them to cast their elesh norn iona glen elendra or whatever else they might grab with it from their hand and win that way never having seen a gifts ungiven. Does that mean that the fact that they were able to play their cards without cheating them into play and winning that way makes it not a combo deck? No way! They still WANT to be able to cheat their creatures into play it is still their main gameplanfocus. In a game where an opponent brings in RIP doesnt mean that the game is over they can still cast the cards and win later but it is still CLEARLY a combo.Now in the gifts scenario it requires  mana spent overall and  mana spent at once to cheat in elesh or iona. That knocks somewhere between  mana off the cost of the spell. What is so different about that and trying to knock  mana off of a reality smasher or drowner? Is gifts ungiven actually a synergy this whole time since I am able to win without casting gifts if I didnt see it that game?,ModernMagic,dgiodp7,0,t5_2xs5t

11714314,0,t1_dgntdvg,Playing SFM does have opportunity cost. You have to play extra cards in your deck that dont interact. Think about this Goyf doesnt stop you from dying to Ad Naus Tron Storm etc. but it provides a quick cheap clock backed by the interaction in your deck. SFM is cheap but instead of dedicating four deck slots to your clock youre likely dedicating six slots to support it. Meaning you have extra potential draws that dont help and a clock that requires you to spend an additional  mana to make it a clock. This isnt to say SFM is bad or even not great but with how powerful modern is now I think it slots somewhere are Goyf Snapcaster and Deaths Shadow in power level. A good creature but nothing that breaks the game or flips tables. ,ModernMagic,dgnuhr9,7,t5_2xs5t

I have never heard that before.The utility of GSZ in modern is exaggerated every time it is brought up. The closest comparison to it is chord of calling which is instant speed and can grab anything of any color but costs  more mana with convoke.Chord cant ramp on turn one but a lot of people really overestimate the power level of GSZ doing so. Its always better to play Noble Hierarch on turn one when you have both and decks that play zenith will probably play x hierarch too meaning it isnt going to be a mode you use  of the time even when it is available to you.,ModernMagic,dgpesu0,1,t5_2xs5t
11728407,1,t1_dgp6s3e,This circlejerk mentality is full of completely shortsighted and flawed logic.  Commonality in cards doesnt really mean anything at all.Goyf is the  creature because its the only creature that does what he does so efficiently that multiple different deck types are built around him... so he gets a ton of play across the board.  Snap is the  creature in the entire format and that same reasoning applies he goes into every deck that runs interactive blue spells as well as spells of other colors that are cheap to cast so yes he is a major piece of blue control strategies even if he isnt an actual counterspell.Look at the list for creatures the top white creature is ... Thats  places behind snapcaster for fucks sake white is supposed to be a creature heavy color yet none of those creatures individually are good enough to be a modern staple like goyf or snap.Serum visions is blues Path stop crying.  Its a very good card that enables multiple different strategies as well as being used heavily in blue decks.The point of this is that you cant just cherry pick bullshit bullet points and cry about how unbalanced an entire color or archetype is unless youre going to go through every color and do the same thing.  Yes GBx is overpowered right now yes the printing of fatal push has helped black a lot but thats just what happens in this game.
