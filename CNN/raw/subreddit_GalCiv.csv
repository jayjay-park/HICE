4011915,0,t1_crcn9pd,Steam workshop integration will be released in the first major patch build .  but that wont be out for a few months I believe.They really should have postponed launch for a few more months and polished the game first. But alas we live in the get the game out and worry about problems later era. ,GalCiv,crdl83o,6,t5_2uaye
4019139,0,t3_36bc2o,I would say an expanded campaign will come as part of any expansion packs.  Thats what they did with Gal Civ . ,GalCiv,creeuv2,1,t5_2uaye
4036195,0,t1_crfrz3t,yeah I miss the espionage stuff and the morale system needs some fleshing out as well....,GalCiv,crgcun2,1,t5_2uaye

4119806,0,t1_crpvgf0,They are around. It all depends on exactly how many inhospitable planets your map spawned.  I generally only go down the extreme colonization part of the tech tree if I can see a planet that requires it.,GalCiv,crpvt2z,2,t5_2uaye

7804089,0,t1_d3qbdm3,Thats pretty FUDtastic given that GalCiv III . just came out heck . came out less than  weeks ago.Theres never been much of a GalCiv presence on Reddit but its Steam and game forums are very active.  GalCiv III like GalCiv II before it will get updated and enhanced and while Stellaris has its charms so does GalCiv III.  When Civilization VI comes out how would it seem to you if Firaxis fans began saying the EU was dead?According to SteamSpy GalCiv III has a quarter million owners and  players in the past  weeks.  Similarly Distant Worlds Universe a game many feel is better than Stellaris has only  players in the last  weeks and a total of  owners and no one considers it dead.If you want to rah rah about Stellaris thats fine.  I like Stellaris too.  But to suggest that Stellaris somehow means the end of GalCiv is ludicrous.   Lots of players are turned off by the grand strategy genre purely because of the continuous turns nature.,GalCiv,d3t8oml,13,t5_2uaye
