7323503,0,t1_d28j4ri,Great response Jacqueline! The essay is heavy on the topic of autism and doesnt emphasize the essay title until the last paragraph of the paper. Parenting is a topic that Jen talks about but I feel like autism and how parents handle it is the main topic of the paper. The first paragraph opens with autism as well and the paper is very anecdotal on the topic of autism. The last sentence of the first paragraph seems like a better fit for an essay title because it addresses the family unit while discussing the positives and negatives of autisms impact on the family. This is what the paper ends up being about. It is a great paper but for me the title doesnt strongly reflect the overall nature of the essay. To the answer the question I believe treating them equally in terms of learning and their development will be harmful because of the learning levels. Loving them equally is important but when it comes to their development special care should be given to the child with more need.This is a very moving essay and I really enjoyed reading it. ,engl1302,d2amrga,1,t5_3ay2j

This method of therapy can help all patients to stay motivated from small kids to old adults. I believe this unique method can be entertaining way for people to stay active through therapy and carry it on to the real world. Video games is something that can be continued past therapy because they are popular and easy to have at ones home because like anyssa said technology is used just about everywhere. Once put in a real world setting i believe the movement will become natural because the patient will become used to doing it from playing so much in therapy. ,engl1302,d2ds7tu,1,t5_3ay2j
7473497,0,t3_4hlf52,Awesome presentation I chose option  and as your intended audience I liked how you explained what you are doing and you can tell how much you know by the information you provide. I am a gamer myself and I do believe your research question is interesting because you can track the impact of consumer demand on the industry by the quality of a game as well as how often games are being released. You make these points in your conference. I agree when you say that some gaming studios are choosing quantity over quality which is true and is negatively affecting the scope of the industry. I liked your public document because it was straight to the point and shows the method and process of a video game in the industry. Overall your presentation and public document was concise and effective. Thanks!,engl1302,d2roxkq,1,t5_3ay2j
7485622,0,t3_4hlqu1,I agree that the success of a business depends on the satisfaction of its customers. I like how you used your resources to back your opinion with facts. Using a video and visuals from the prezi presentation created more belief for your argument. I really enjoyed what you have done for your final good luck on your other ones!,engl1302,d2t2opf,1,t5_3ay2j
8564503,0,t1_d6by626,I have to agree with you that I am not one to like writing papers but you are right that students who are forced to do more are more likely to learn more than an average student who does not try to be well rounded in their information.,engl1302,d6c53og,1,t5_3ay2j
10602675,0,t1_dd7rv91,Yes it is better to get to know your group members because it will be easier to collaborate with them as well express opinions on specific topics. If a group has good communication their end result will be amazing!,engl1302,dd9l2m8,1,t5_3ay2j
10780596,0,t3_5tx0qc,I agree completely with all you in that writing shouldnt be left to just do in English class instead it should be practice in all the different subjects taught in school. I believe that nowadays you dont really see an emphasis on speaking any more many professors either focus on reading or writing skills theres is very few that actually want to improve their students speaking skills. For example Im a very poor speaker and while I struggle with that all of my previous professors instead of giving me advice on how to improve they recommend that I take a an oral speaking class I think that this is example of what Carter criticizes should change in the education system. ,engl1302,ddrxurj,1,t5_3ay2j
11387460,0,t1_dfjb1md,When you spoke of unaccredited sources it made me think of sources that may also lead you to form you very own opinion in regards to the subject matter having to do with the sources that you use. In other words the information presented by one biased site or source may be truthful up to a certain extent. On the other hand you have an opposing argument that is pertaining to the same subject matter and the source is also biased. This kind of creates an environment where several sources could although biased and in opposition of one another have some common ground as far as the basis of their claims. The internet is valuable in that it lets others access a vast amount of information it is up to the individual searching for information to be able to distinguish material that is credible to their own argument. ,engl1302,dfmqzp7,1,t5_3ay2j
