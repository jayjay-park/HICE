Not all but a majority. From a business standpoint thats a huge reason not to go for it  hence the decision.That leaves us with two cases where a majority of people dont get motion sick  vehicle simulators like truck simulator or elite dangerous which dont require special equipment but are somewhat niche and lighthouseready games which arent traditional in any sense and will have to carve their own niche.However Im not entirely condemning VR. I believe it has a chance  if it bypasses the game industry entirely at first. Specifically I would love to watch sports events via VRready cameras or even pornography. Frankly anything can work. I honestly dont see any downsides here. No struggle with controls no need for overly expensive hardware to support the VR no motion sickness if captured right by professionals who know how to avoid it i.e. not you.Once we develop a strong VR television platform then we can move on to videogames. I dont think were ready for that yet.,ExtraCredits,cz5tmt4,1,t5_2tx06
