4275721,0,t1_cs7l1rg,Ravenclaw! I tried Pottermore a couple years ago and was put into Hufflepuff my second choice house. A Muggle organization exists that wants to prevent and cure a condition I have that isnt even a disease even though they think it is. I call them The Voldemort Foundation and their cofounder the Muggle Umbridge. Her grandson has the condition too and she considers him less human because of it.My mother read one of Rowlings postHP novels The Casual Vacancy and said that there were too many characters in it with the personality of Uncle Vernon.,Casual_Books,cs7lbqd,2,t5_38oir
