9791249,0,t1_dajya4h,Thanks for your response! I doubt ill reroll im sure by the time those units come out ill be even more invested into my account.,crash_fever,dajzg5b,1,t5_3h9po
9838428,0,t3_5g6rky,Depends on their skills and type of unit. For example having two dupes of a recovery based unit probably wont work ,crash_fever,dapyxj2,1,t5_3h9po

10011032,0,t1_dbc579i,Hehe... I dont exactly have enough but I hit jackpot with pulling a few similar units so Im pretty close to Trojan but I didnt want to waste my ghosts on the wrong unit and have to save up again so I asked ,crash_fever,dbcgspm,1,t5_3h9po

10123833,0,t3_5kax6g,Lmao. In Taiwanese version the max is like . million... With  Nikola and One Date Masamune. Using Murasaki Shikibu with a Generic Blue teamRapunzel can also hit . million.,crash_fever,dbr54cm,1,t5_3h9po
10153896,0,t1_dbuzmf3,Unfortunately you have only a few good units. Hazuru Date Baldr are fairly strong units while the rest are very limited in their use and are generally seen as bad units. If you really want to make sure you get good units you could either reroll or make sure that the money you spend in the game goes towards Festival banners. ,crash_fever,dbv00xi,2,t5_3h9po
10163752,0,t1_dbvbzr9,You got Freud Thumbalina Alfhiemer. You are missing a good yellow and blue unit but can use Super Wizards such as Odin or Qilin to supplement that. ,crash_fever,dbw48p4,1,t5_3h9po

10240042,0,t1_dc4r3q0,Your initial pulls arent horrible but Ive noticed that you did single pulls and not a x pull If Im counting correctly. The benefit of pulling x for the current hatchers at least is that you are guaranteed atleast   unit.You dont need to reroll unit you get two of those guys. Really you only would need one and then for example also get Aladdin and Snow White that youve already gotten. Since there are two hatchers overlapping its probably smart to save up  gems and do a x pull of each of them. You can get more polygon by playing multiplayer games. You get  polygons for the first  people you meet and then  polygons for the next . Joining Gold Ducks over the weekend is a perfect time to do this. After you do those  pulls if you feel like you havent gotten what you wanted you can reroll but I think even if you got a few more unitsyoull get at least two  stars youll be fine. Aladdin and Snow White are pretty high rated units as it is but it would be nice to get a more rounded out base of units to start from. ,crash_fever,dc4rl1h,2,t5_3h9po

11126085,0,t1_det4b8x,Roll if you dont have too many good units check the updated tier list but you should wait for the fever festivals or future events. Japans having their White Day event and the Summer event was announced. Should wait for the Summer one hopefully well get it cause that gacha have lots of top tier blue units!,crash_fever,det4rur,1,t5_3h9po
