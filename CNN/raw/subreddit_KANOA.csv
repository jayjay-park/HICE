9056808,0,t1_d80cp1k,I hate to be a speculator ew yuck.I would like the KANOA moderator to say the truth about this but from what it seems like to me is that they were able to get majority of the tech finalized when opening preorders. They released a video of their first prototypes and thought  months was enough to get through mass production but soon realized through alphabeta tests of that the earbuds had major flaws with the antenna the majority reason for the delays expressed through the last couple of newsletters and now we are in the beginning of the longest delay trying to get through manufacturing. In all honesty this latest timeline for spring  seems to be the most realistic but toughest to pill to swallow. KANOA should have said a later timeline though it doesnt sound too good rather than putting out dates and not meeting them. Like seriously how can they expect to change the date  times on us and not expect us to be mad? If the date was set later people wouldnt like it but at least it saves us the huge disappointments. Nobody likes to get stood up on a date especially when people are paying for the date with their hard earned money.,KANOA,d80hesi,1,t5_3c7i8
