3020055,0,t3_2rnavf,Ive been learning grant writing on the job. If I were going for a gt ish grant I would probably go to someone who really knows what theyre doing. In general though this is my experience having won several now and consulting with people involved in various levels of the process follow the instructions talk to the folks in charge of the grant and be very specific. Oh and proof read. Have other people proof read. ,HistoricPreservation,cob0y8g,2,t5_2rt3q
