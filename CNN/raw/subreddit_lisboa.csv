3216745,0,t3_2wh5e3,They there Thisisbullplop! Awesome that youre coming to Lisbon its definitely a great place to eat. Im also a huge foodie and am lucky enough to work for a restaurant appguide. So Id be happy to help you out with some recommendations. Depending on what youre looking for in terms of taste and how much youd like to spend there are many places worth visiting.Around the Lisbon area you should definitely visit some awesome places like O Tachadas  Has amazing meat on the grill with very large portions and definitely wont break the bank. Worth a visit. Taberna Ideal  Really nice place with awesome decoration and a cool take on Portuguese petiscos. Basically you order a bit of everything and just nibble throughout the entire meal. Word of advice Be there early or late as they are always full and usually dont take reservations. Worth the visit though.  Belcanto  Two michelin stars and probably the most famous Portuguese chef hes the one that takes Bourdain to Ramiro. Not cheap in the slightest but Im sure itll be worth it.Volver by Chakall  Also kind of pricey but has amazing food and an awesome ambiance. Meat here is awesome.O Largo  Decently priced with amazing decor and very good food. One of my favourites in Lisbon.La Paparrucha  Argentinian steakhouse. Really really amazing meat and one of the best views over Lisbon. If you go there ask for a booking in the upstairs room its worth it.Estrela da Bica  Kind of hidden restaurant in one of Lisbons coolest bairros boroughs. Also based around traditional Portuguese petiscos. Worth a visit.Also you should definitely try the pastis de Belm custard tarts from Pastis de Belm youll find them in many other places but dont settle. This place is the original and theyre the best.If youre going to Sintra thats my hometown you cant miss Piriquita pastries. You should try both the queijadas and the travesseiros.Unfortunately in the Sintra village theres not many decent good restaurants mostly tourist traps overpriced and with terrible food.However if you manage to get a car or you can also take a bus there you should definitely check out Azenhas do Mar  Youll get amazing fresh fish there and the scenery is unlike anything youve ever seen.Feel absolutely free to PM me if youre looking for any other recommendations always happy to help another food enthusiast. ,lisboa,covf1e7,1,t5_2sein

Por isso preferiria estudar em casa e falar por skype ou pessoalmente com estrangeiros.Julho est escrito mal ,lisboa,d2ubp05,1,t5_2sein

9077630,0,t3_54lhj4,If you want to interact with people I suggest taking the Linha de Cascais and getting off at Estoril. Turn right on the boardwalk and head towards Cascais. It is a little touristy but not bad this time of the year. There are plenty of minibeaches and rocks where you can sit and relax. There are also lots of cafes and restaurants.If you really want to avoid tourists I suggest getting off the train a stop or two before Estoril. Alcatruz is my favorite local restaurant that overlooks rocky cliffs on the river. The prices are reasonable. The closer you get to Cascais the more expensive stuff is going to be generally.Let me know if you have any specific questions or want a recommendation! ,lisboa,d82zfio,2,t5_2sein
