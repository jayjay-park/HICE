When I try to come out of it lately I seem to roll my eyes back as far as they go til they open luckily I sleep by myself or else surely they would think I was possessed! Please update me it does happen again I only could describe it now because yesterday morning it happened to me every time I tried to fall back to sleep about  times.

668746,0,t3_21co64,This is an anecdote not proof and I dont think that having a sleeping partner prevents the condition. But when my husband sleeps beside me he will sometimes hear me whimper a little when an SP attack is coming on and hes learned that touching me gently will snap me right out of an SP episode. I still get the beginnings of an episode when hes beside me but hes learned how to head it off at the pass so to speak. It only progresses to fullon paralysis when he gets up before me or is away at night for work. In any case if sleeping beside your puppy helps thats awesome!

1168517,0,t3_27gtrv,WARNING TEXT WALL!Hey op weird thing is it happen right now its pm here was having a lil nap when It turn to a full sleep. the thing is I discover something what parts you can move what you can do. Lets me say things right now that you are gonna think i am crazy but the thing is I was trying to remember the whole time of what was happening the thing is your brain WANTS IT. Its with your eyes semiopen really little vertical field of vision. I got to clear some things My brother was in the same room as me and he was playing on his Xbox and in the dream it was THAT IT WAS HIM REALLY PLAYING What i am trying to say it is that in isnt a dream its modified reality.  but before getting to sleep I was using my laptop  and I went sleeping with it on my chest I have a fan so no radiation because there is little to no heat coming below the fan. I was sleeping with a  minute video half life opposing force speedrun I was watching for the hell of it. But i started to get sleepy at like the first few minutes the rest is nothing since I was already sleeping I had my huge headphones on with me but no sound. All right I have to hurry I am starting to forget things. I only remember the last few details of my dream Weird I was playing some random game on my Xbox while I was on my chair when My brother gives me like one of those disc cases the Xbox has but there was something weird there was something with the case and it was somewhat related to opposing force even though the video had ended. everything in the was was readable nothing Ive seen before weirdly it was mostly black and it came with just a code to redeem but i couldnt see because it had one of those security covers you can rip out. next thing on my way to my bed room where I was sleeping I saw my bathroom had  DOORS and they were open the other one was at looking at the outside. Unlike all dreams this one had all  senses that I could use so it seem real I could seesmelltaste saliva etc... the world seem a little more grainy and graying than usual but I instantly got the Idea because I was exited and though this is too good to be real because of the opposing force thing but then I look again more words can be read. weird it says some strange things like have the Call of UNuty like it was really misspelled but the words were clear and readable. So I try my common method on checking to see if I was in a dream close my eyes with force and open them had to try  times to which when I semiopen the eyes it look still bit graying maybe it was for the time I wake up. so I tried the same Technic again but in the intension that I get to sleep again to see if I can get in the dream again huge mistake. couldnt open my eyes wider than I wish for because I couldnt and got stuck with semiopen eyes. Was looking at my brother playing halo wars trying to move or say things. only thing i could do to communicate is breathe heavily and louder trying to breathe in a strange way so he can wake me nope but he did look behind to look at me breath but then he continue with my mouth open i could do that. in the state I could think straight I instantly remember things and faster and quicker I instantly knew this was a sleepparalysis. I learned something You can get out by just relaxing and trying to relax. Next thing i am going to say is gonna be like is not gonna be understandable you then next try to sleep but do NOT open them the first experience I could sort of control my eyes and when I closeopen them I couldnt control not even my breathing. Just try to relax dont try to scream just sleep. this stage is probably cause in a state when your sleeping and you wakeup in the wrong moment. All you can do Is sleep. When I closed my eyes all is black everything but then I see like my WHOLE FUCKING UNCONTROLLABLE BODY IS FUCKING MOVING. WHAT THE FUCK. with my eyes closed so It scared the crap out of me tempting me to open my eyes It felt like I was being pulled but still with my eyes closed I got see something a face.... BOOM! A BLACK SCREAMING GRAY FACE WITH EYES HAVING SOME KIND OF BLACK SHIT COMING OUT OF THING LIKE IT WAS SOME KIND OF SMOKE. IT keep going to my face didnt feel anything touch me waited a few seconds before opening again. Waked in the same position same everything and I was really scared when I can MOVE AGAIN. Jesus this happens only to my brother father and me. My mother and sister thinks we are delusional  Only told my brother and walked out the room to see everything again and at last we are in real life.and I when fast to Reddit look up this subreddit. found this in the top of the subreddit just a few hours ago. Seems weird because Iam also  yearsold. Should have wrote this in throwaway but this is a underpopulated sub so theres that.,Sleepparalysis,ci12ty5,1,t5_2se19
2106894,0,t3_2iz95y,Totally sounds like sleep paralyis to me.But dont be afraid of itIf you let it go you will either fall back to sleep or experience a lucid dream  and that is something fantastic to experience!It may be a little confusing and also exhausting if you are new to it but you will get used to it.If you try to move you will finally wake up and be perfectly fine. During the process of sleep paralyis there is no such thing like passing out only falling asleep or waking up.I know experiencing sleep paralysis for the first time holds some sort of panic but there is really no need to worry. ,Sleepparalysis,cl7mr9f,2,t5_2se19

4221461,0,t3_398q6c,Most of the time I can feel an episode coming on and will do a similar thing to you.If I feel that I can snap myself out of it then Ill attempt a little more. Unfortunately me for me most of the time I try and force myself out of it the feeling of restraint just gets more powerful so I just let it happen. Id say my attempts only work about  of the time for that reason.When I first started getting SP episodes or perhaps first started realising what they were I used the toewiggling technique. As time went on this became less and less effective and now  without an alternative method  I have few options aside from resigning myself to the inevitable. ,Sleepparalysis,cs1fe64,2,t5_2se19

Always the sense of total fear and dread I could feel my bodies position where I lay in bed but had a third person view of me laying in bed.  Then everything goes black and I feel a horrific and terrifying feeling of some fucking evil entity right next to me or on me looking at me but never visual or auditory.  I felt it and it knew I sensed it. Over the years Ive learned to fight it and break the spell.  So weird though I can fall back asleep within a minute of this total mental and physical horror.

5079412,0,t3_3ki3fy,Ive had hundreds of sleep paralysis episodes over the years but a few stand out the earliest I remember from when I was about . Laying in bed and someone come in my bedroom half opening my eyes to see my mum standing at the door Shes just checking if Im home and when I try to sit up and get her attention I cant move a muscle or speak She closes the door while saying to her partner Hes fine just having a lay down Whilst I scream for help. At around  I was living with my dad and was sleeping only to hear the bedroom door open again He walks in and ofcause I cant move he takes of my shirt and starts licking my chest while breathing warm and heavy on me until I manage to wake up with a sickening feeling in my stomach I can still remember how warm it felt to this day and no my Dad neve abused my incase your wondering. Age  Was asleep next to my gf when suddenly the walls turned black and I was pinned against a wall In the middle of the room my girlfriend was tied down and heading towards a buzz saw like in cartoons I tried hysterically to get free as I watched the blade cutting her vertically from her vagina towards her head it was at her chest when I realized she was screaming in orgazmic pleasure instead of pain and she smiled at me until the blade split her head in half.Age  Found myself in bed paralysed unable to move thought maybe if I relax it will go away but as I stopped trying to move I heard the loudest deepest rumble noise of my life it was like  subwoofers in my face at once and I was being pulled down into my bed by gravity then I was blinded by a flash of light and when it all cleared I was on a table  tall white aliens staring down at me taking off there gloves as if too say they are finished and then I woke up in bed instantly knowing it was a nightmare but still scared I would hear that noise again.,Sleepparalysis,cuy9f1y,1,t5_2se19
5392856,0,t3_3ouvpv,I have dealt with sleep paralysis for years. I started having problems with it when I was a senior in high school. I would have minor problems with it prior to that but nothing that as noticeable or scary. The times that it started to get very bad was midway through the year. I had just moved back into my families old home and I will admit I was stressed and going through somethings. I started having very bad sleep paralysis problems. First it would start off like what you would normally read or hear. I would wake up but still be asleep. I wouldnt be able to move and I would feel tingly and heavy. It was normal like this for a few weeks two at most. Then things got worse. I started getting the typical there was something in the room with me feeling. I would be terrified and would fight to move and run but I never could. Every time i had one it would get worse and worse but that thing never got close to me. It would stay in the same spot. Right at the entrance of my room. It would stand there. There would be some nights where I could see it out of the corner of my eye. It would be a perfect silhouette of a man. Sometimes he would get closer and sometimes he would be in the same spot. After while I started to experience what you did. I would fight with all my strength to move. Some nights the furthest I could get was off the bed. I could feel everything like I was moving. I would fall off the bed and I could feel the pain from the fall. I could feel the covers slipping off my feet. I personally felt drugged and I was fighting the effects constantly. Every time I made it a little ways to the bed I felt like there was this cord in my stomach and it would yank me back and I would be back in bed. Each time I woke I had more control but I would get confused if i was awake or not. I would try and turn on the light but it wouldnt go. I would be terrified of something but didnt know what. Every time I would struggle to get out of the room but I would keep waking up in bed. Now by this point I was doing my best not to sleep because I had a hard time trying to figure what was a dream and what was real. I ended up scaring my mom because she woke me up and I started freaking out saying I was asleep and the shadow man was going to get me. It really scared my family and also myself. Then I had the most terrifying dream. I had the same thing when I fell sleep. I had the sleep paralysis would struggle to get out but keep waking in bed. I would get further and further. I dont remember anymore how many time I woke up in bed that night. It was more then all of them combined. I ended up making it out of the room and into the front room. I could barely move so I was dragging myself down the hall. I was trying to get to my moms room. I made it there after a million attempts and tried to wake my mom. She kept brushing me off and telling me to go to bed. When I was in her room I felt that thing that horrible thing following me. After that one they did hit as often. I moved in with my boyfriend and his family. I had some very bad accounts then as well. Basically the same. Now I just have sleep paralysis where I cant move or I am able to but I end back up in bed. I rarely now feel the shadow man. I have several no...millions of other times and things that has happened but I never understood. People have tired explaining the scientific part of it but It still scares me. When it hits I have panic attacks. They come and go. I can go months without and then suddenly have them. ,Sleepparalysis,cw0zx21,2,t5_2se19

7125798,0,t3_4d5lqr,After you have a few episodes of SP you can eventually try to experiment around to see what triggers your SP. For me the  main causes are . extreme fatigue ie. Being mentally and physically drained from activities all day long. . Stress ie. Due dates and exams I tend to have continuous cycles of SP during examination periods. Dont be worry you are mentally saint this are just lucid hallucinations that tend to be extremely realistic. Try to avoid your triggers or learn to overcome SP by finding out ways to snap yourself out pre SP zone. ,Sleepparalysis,d1o4dro,1,t5_2se19

7286248,0,t3_4f6fy9,The trick to get out of SP is to increase your breathing try to hyperventilate yourself. As you may already know SP happens when our brains are somewhat awake but motor functioncontrol is still shut off. However messages from the brain can still go to the lungs at all times so breathing can still be controlled though it is difficult. If you increase your breathing you can get yourself to wake up manually.I dont recommend this though as SP seems to be highly controlled by our perceptions of it. I used to have terror SP though I never actually saw any monsters does anyone know if that means anything in a psychological sense? but once I stopped fighting it and just kinda went along for the ride and told myself its all just illusions and there is no need to panic they stopped being a lot less scary. If you try to run away they may get more scary. Now I no longer fear them but actually look forward to them. Sometimes I hear auditory hallucinations of conversations played back from weeks years ago. but then I wake up and find out they werent real conversations but either way its an interesting experience.,Sleepparalysis,d26ebi7,1,t5_2se19

7464152,0,t3_4hj2lo,Sounds more like you had a lucid dream and I think the two are connected. I will have lucid dreams once in awhile but they just started somewhat recently. I also have sleep paralysis so I figure the two might be related.Either way thats shitty as hell. To answer your question no. Try as I might Ive never talked out loud in my sleep. I try to yell for help or even breathe heavier to wake my husband so he can shake me awake but nothing works until I pop up awake by myself eventually.If you know youre having SP or a possible lucid dream try to will yourself back to sleep. I know its difficult. I used to be able to do it for awhile... Now I panic until I wake up again. But for awhile Id calm myself and tell myself to go back to deep sleep if possible. On the other hand if its a lucid dream you might be able to change the dream. Ive done it before but again I havent had many of those.Good luck. Especially to your SO!

Typically SP happens while sleeping on your back not side. Ive also read about it happening when you sleep somewhere you dont typically sleep. Idk how often you stay at your bfs place but maybe that possibility triggered it. Ive had SP for at least  years and have never injured myself as you describe.

Didnt you get that feeling of waking up right after that in the same position you were paralyzed?And in relation to the mental state anxiety depression etc I think it does make a difference. One thing I noticed more than once is that if Im very very tired both body and mind exausted its more likely to happen. And I dont think it is possible to make it become positive at least not yet. I remember having positiveneutral experiences with just warm lights in the door and I couldnt move or speak shout etc but nothing happened and no one appeared but the way this developed through the years have become more and more negative. I have been thinking about facing it or a way to do it. I know that I another way to avoid or at least reduce the chances of happening is to not sleep on your back and sometimes I think about doing it just to see what happens.,Sleepparalysis,d5aaln1,2,t5_2se19

10436750,0,t3_5pfvxw,Just had my second experience ever not even  minutes ago. I am watching a sleeping infant who wont let anyone sleep if he is not near someone tonight. I like him to sleep in his crib but people gotta sleep so here he is. I tell myself that while he is near me I wont sleep so I dont crush or smother him. Well apparently I fell asleep and I woke up laying on my side with my left eye open and I hear someone enter the room I go to turn my head toward them but no dice. I hear them making noises clear as day but I can do nothing to see them. I realize whats happening at this point and start directing all my energy into swinging my arm off of me and I feel like its moving but it is these phantom movements that you mention. I cant even get my other eye to open. The funny thing is I was just at a gathering last night where we were talking about sleep paralysis. I tried all the tricks I had heard about wiggling toes moving your tounge nothing. I figure it lasted  seconds maybe and towards the end I started to freak out feeling like I would be this way forever.

11217864,0,t3_603opg,I have been having SP for a few years now. I understand what youre going through. Like you I also feel lucky in a sense to have experienced something many people claim doesnt exist. But most of my SP was much more vivid and intense than yours. I have been sucked through my bed and into the ground and I have had many scary figures take part in my suffering during SP. But the worst part about your post is that you seem to already know the answer to how you can stop it from happening but you seem to not want to use the tools that are available to you. I know this is exactly what you dont want to hear but I feel like I need to tell you anyways. The only thing that has ever helped me during SP is to call on the name of Jesus. Even if you cant speak you can always think about his name. Even reciting a prayer in your head is enough to make the entity leave you alone. The closer I have gotten to Jesus the less I am harassed in the middle of the night. Its as simple as that. ,Sleepparalysis,df3j4rz,-1,t5_2se19
