3079244,0,t3_2vaaji,Ive got one of these at  cm diameter showing some staining from use lying about. Its pretty much what you see a thin metallic thing quite stable and useful but not as warm as bamboo or wood obviously which is why its become neglected I decided that risking rot is worth it. Also its situated in Finland and our postal fees are atrocious but could check them if youre interested.,teaexchange,coh5th9,1,t5_2tmd3
