3199841,0,t3_2wk61u,Ive had good experiences with Greater Boston Motorsports.  I would recommend going to look at Moms foxboro as well even if you dont buy there its nice to be able to sit on so many bikes and they are easy going about rides if you find something you like.  I dont know what style bike you are looking for but whatever it is Moms will probably have multiple examples from different brands on display.  Nothing like sitting on a bike and seeing how it fits you to help you decide what you want.,MArideit,cotnvri,1,t5_2xfwd
