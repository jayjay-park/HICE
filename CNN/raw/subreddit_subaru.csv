All I know about him is that he had at least a boost gauge installed and the car was returned to stock before he sold it.  Probably not a great indicator.  Second owner mostly kept it garaged so I got it with a hair under k in .Ive had to have the following maintenance items done Front shocks replaced rear soon to follow when I have the  but they have some life left Timing belt replaced Belt to power steering replaced was giving me a rhythmic squeal at turning extremes in low temps Rear brake rotors replaced Spark plugs replaced k mile service Regular oil changes every k milesIve had it  and a half years.  All in all its been pretty easy on me or at least easier on me than my old Runner was.  I dont do anything TOO crazy in it except the occasional aggressive maneuver and only a couple of canyon runs.  Ive got it in my head to keep it in good shape forever too.  Eventually Ill have some cosmetic upkeep to do what with some prior snowbank damage and cracking in the clear coat but thats way down on my list of priorities.  Im sure there are wiser folk here than I who can tell us both what to look forward to on the road ahead BTW whats that you say about the uppipe?

777180,0,t1_cgsm4vw,Sure! If you can find a straight stretch of back road you can practice there just shifting. Alternatively you could find a parking lot but you cant get near as much speed there.Theres going to be times its frustrating. When I was driving my  Corolla I had to learn a manual. I went out to a parking lot and learned out how to take off. Felt good enough so I went on the road. Drove for a few days on the road without any problems until one day Im turning left to go back home. Im in the turn lane waiting for a green arrow. It turns I go to accelerate and I kill it. No biggie. Start it back up try again kill it. I sat there for  light cycles trying to get my car to move. Finally out of frustration and rage I gave it a lot of gas and let off the clutch and off I went. Within a month I felt completely comfortable driving stick and didnt even think about it. It just felt natural after a while.Moral of the story is this Its going to be frustrating sometimes and its going to feel like you keep messing up but seriously youll get the hang of it and be alright. I promise it becomes second nature and you really become in tune with you car even if its a HP Econocar like mine was.,subaru,cgsmbcp,1,t5_2rdhg

797918,0,t3_23a5v0,Ive had a Toyota Corolla and a Toyota Celica before I bought my  WRX. They are equally reliable and they both hold their value. I would consider Subaru Toyota and Honda all on the same page as far as reliability... but Subaru has better customer service and loyalty.If you buy a NA naturally asperated Subaru dont think of it as a project to turn FI force induction turbo charged as it doesnt make sense as far as money spent. If you want a turbo Subaru buy a turbo Subaru. They are a breed all by themselves because of the boxer motor.Worth it? TOTALLY! For the summer speed and the ease of driving in the winter with Subarus AllTime AWD its the best car around in my opinion. There are plenty of videos on YouTube comparing AWD systems for all cars makers. Subarus is symetrical so all of the axels and everything turns the same giving better traction spread to all wheels. Other makers have the tranny off to the side and that makes one axel longer than the others meaning it takes more effort to move that wheel in a slip. The best video for proof is the forester on the dry mud slope. Dry mud is very slick and the Forester was the only vehicle to make it over the top from a standstill on the slope. If you have more questions post or ask questions. I was a Subaru salesmen for  years before moving to banking. ,subaru,cguz5tb,1,t5_2rdhg

The Chicco NextFit is by far the coolest looking one but its just humongous.  Theres no way that thing was fitting.  In the end we settled on the Chicco KeyFit .  Its the only one where my wife was able to actually recline the seat a little and not have her knees against the dashboard.  Thanks for taking the time to  put together a helpful response.

931807,0,t1_cha03rd,Its a pretty simple process but its just really time consuming and there are a LOT of hidden factors that I didnt really consider until they hit me head on. The spider gears in the center dif need to be welded and the front axles pulled. Thats the easy part. The rear axles are GARBAGE. Ive replaced like  or  making around whp. Anyone wanna donate some  sti axles? D lol Another thing is that the stock VLSD r is extremely squirrelly. Just throws the power around back and forth between the inside and outside tires making it really sketchy when the car is midslide. I actually have a buddy with a RWD Legacy SS that lost it on the bank and smacked that ass right on the wall because of it. That was fixed by welding her up which as anyone in the drift community knows is a pain in my fucking ass to daily drive on. This is a temporary fix until I eventually go with an R conversion which again is not cheap and the funds are just not there right now. Stock steering angle is GARBAGE. Straight up like Titanic status. Thats a fix that will be easily avoided by re drilling the knuckles so that the tie rods sit closer. Ill also be swapping the steering rack to a  FWD impreza rack to gain a bit more angle. But with more angle comes great pain in the ass because the wheels will start to rub onto the LCAs. I have a buddy who actually JUST started fabricating custom extended LCAs so those will be another hole to throw money into. BUT once all those problems are addressedfixed the car will be perfect. My motor is built enough to be able to handle a reliable amount of HP for a very long time because thats mainly what I want. Id rather have a drift car that can take a beating with less power than what its capable of than one that leaves me stranded every time I want to romp a little bit.  So basically thats what going RWD entails its a blessing and a curse but the journey has gone too long to turn back now. ,subaru,cha7920,3,t5_2rdhg

From video reviews and stuff it seems like the Xmode works pretty well for steep slippery roads but im not sure its any better than a manual. You see a lot of suvs now that have some sort of offroad mode and i always assumed they had that just because automatics are terrible offroad compared to manuals. The manual is only available for the base and premium trim lines so if you want any fancy features youll have to go with the cvt. If you do choose the manual then get a  because the premium w manual has a sunroof  didnt. I would recommend going and test driving both transmissions. My dad who hates automatics test drove a cvt forester and actually liked it. I think youre making a good decision with the forester.

Some of the ones that didnt crack did flex a ton and attributed to the clutch issues people were experiencing.  Throw out bearing is also a common issue.

1255425,0,t1_ciareza,Point  I would guess they havent updated the STi motor yet because they havent finished the new power plant.  Couple that with a typical American idea that motor liters is better and selling a . STi vs a . WRX makes marketing sense.  The . is still more powerful and the variable valve timing along with other internal improvements make it a very strong motor if a bit dated.  When the new STi motor comes out probably next year maybe the year after it will have all the new toys and will probably make about  HP.  Subaru stages these improvements so that sales stay reliable.  The Impreza is always updated before the WRX which is usually a year before the STi.  Here in the States they gotta make sure things will sell.  As far as the hatchback goes they will acquiesce sooner or later the Levorg exists for a reason.  At the moment the biggest problem Ive heard about it coming here is the fact that it says Grovel backwards and Subaru wont change the name for this market.  A turbo hatch will come back.The  speed is better for everything but going in a straight line which is not Subarus main concern.  The AWD is the real reason Subarus are capable of sub  times anyway if they were FWD or RWD they wouldnt be posting even . seconds.  It is sort of a side effect of the handling improvements that the WRX can do a sub second .  In the corners the nd gear on the  speed is heaven.  It keeps you right in the sweet spot for tight corners on the  speed first is super short and nd goes all the way to .  Taking a corner at  it bogs like crazy.,subaru,ciaumfx,2,t5_2rdhg

On the twisties youll be hard pressed to find a car that screams to be pushed to its full potentialie limits like the BRZ.  I saw you said winter isnt a concern. Does it rain a lot? AWD will help with the grip there as well but canwill still hydroplane so dont be an idiot. So that might push you to the WRX over rwd and the brz. To be fair plenty of people drive in rain with rwd just fine. Again dont be an idiot and youd be fine. If you opt for the brz get ready for people criticizing the car because its slow. Its a great car and ridiculously fun. You cant go wrong with any Subaru really. Cant comment about the  WRX. I havent driven one but the chassis is supposed to be much improved.

1673940,0,t1_cjq58te,Yep. I bought an  STI in  with k miles that was imported to Canada from Georgia. It was clean never seen winter obviously but it had a SPT intake TBE lowering springs short shifter and that is all that the dealership knew of. I was young and impatient at the time though so i just bought it anyway because it was a cool car. I owned it for . years and had to put new struts clutch valve cover gaskets strut mounts on the front and had to do the brake pads and timing beltwater pump as just routine maintenance. When doing the clutch I also found out that it had a lightweight ACT flywheel. I replaced the exhaust because it was entirely too loud and saw that the midpipe was welded to the tailpipe and it was all one piece.When I went to sell it I had to put a catalytic converter on it to pass the etest which means the etest it got when was sold to me was obviously a fake and so was the safety because I needed new tail lights because the ones that were on it when I bought it were blacked out with some spray film which doesnt pass safety. The reflectors were removed from the headlights which I hadnt even noticed  Luckily i was able to source some on the local forum and install them.I had to do this all to a car that was only  or  years old. It made me sell the car because of what i had to put into it and I lost money on it. It really sucks because when i sold it it was in perfect working order.

Taking a right on red without yielding will not result in a ticket only a lost insurance claim. Which furthers my point. And how about this. When you file an insurance claim youre signing yourself over to that company. Once they decide who is at fault you have to accept it. And they CAN say these tail lights are technically legal but are so black we deem them the cause of the accident and there is not a damn thing you can do about it.

1679648,0,t3_2dm03p,You need more external flashes. Or one of those large bouncers. Your single flash is putting that spot of light onto the car and leaves the rest unlighted.Also something i can recommend is a CTO colour to orange filter for the flash. I got myself a sample swipe from Lee Filters and took the  Full C.T. Orange from it. I turns the pesky white light of the flash into that nice K tungsten light. Or the  Half C.T. Orange K which is not too orange. In your pics all the surroundings have that orange tone to them due to the light pollution from the city below. And then there is that perfectly white flash that puts the part of your car that its able to light completely out of place. And White BalanceColour correction cant really fix that.

Rota is a Copier they do not  replicate the wheels. They do in fact do RampD on their Copies before putting them on the market.

2073903,0,t3_2iloov,Firstoff looks like youre in Ontario yes? Remember that while AWD will help with traction in snow and ice it only helps you get moving and with stability when cornering under power. It is not a replacement for proper tires or safe driving technique in heavy weather conditions.Regarding maintenance Youre lucky that you have the EJ engine so are less prone to head gasket issues than the infamous DOHC EJD. Nevertheless it may not be a bad idea to add the Subaru Coolant Conditioner whenever you drain and replace the coolant. Speaking of draining coolant the timing belt in this car needs to be done every K miles.If you ever need to get your car towed make sure its on a flatbed or using wheel dollies otherwise you risk damage to the center differential. Also always either replace tires all together or have new tires shaved down to match the others.Regarding modifyingSubarus are kinda like legos its very easy to swap parts between models and years. For example in my  i put in the center console from an  which has imo better cupholders and looks more modern. You can swap in the rear swaybar from a similar platform WRX in order to get less body roll in turns and make the car less prone to understeer. Some other places that might make sense for some easy and minimallyintrusive modificationsSound the stock stereo and speakers are pretty crappy even by the standards of inexpensive sedans of that age.If you want to ditch the steelies its pretty easy to find OEM wheels from other Subarus yours take x most Subarus take that but some use x or aftermarket options. Or take off the covers and rock raw steelies.A tint isnt a bad idea considering the amount of exposed glass these cars heat up pretty quick in the summer sun.,subaru,cl3fss1,4,t5_2rdhg

Mine is a  with  miles and it runs just fine. What you will want to know is if the head gasket has been replaced and when the clutch was done. If the HG has been replaced and you have plenty of life left on your clutch then this will take you KM no problem. There may be some minor things that do pop up around k miles like Knock sensors O sensors and such but thats cheap and easy to do yourself.,subaru,cl3xsba,1,t5_2rdhg

This week new camber bolts from Eibach are going in along with new wheel bearings all around. Im going to take it in for an alignment after that to see how the suspension geometry looks and depending on what they say Im probably going to do the Whiteline lower ball joint and outer tie rod set. Im also replacing the valve cover gaskets along with a new O ring for the dip stick. Im also getting some new lug nuts and air filter That is all for this week but nothing really worth showing off.

It is true that you could drive Subis almost anywhere with just all season tiresand most do and a lot of care. But If you feel you need them then by all means get them.I feel the main difference in switching from all season to winter tires is the stopping distance and the lateral grip. a lot of subis i know have blizzaks and they love them.

2377923,0,t1_cm5m38g,That would be nice. Not sure. The CV the shop charged me  to put it in. I had my friend with me before when we replaced it but it was bad from the start unfortunately. With him gone I decided to just drop it off at the shop since I was thinking it would need a wheel bearing anyways. It turned out it was a CV all along so we replaced it again and now my other one is clicking. After I picked her up from the shop the VDC would slam on the brakes on its own then pop a code. Im pretty sure they knocked a wheel speed sensor out which is why its doing that but Im really not sure. Ive paid out a couple hundred so far and really am just wanting to get everything straightened out.My boss thinks that its the lift thats causing it but I dont think so. I drove it around being lifted  from the springs not being compressed and it didnt pop a single code or activate when it didnt need to. It only started popping a code after the alignment shop.That seems about right for struts but that labor is so much.  If youre feeling daring you could always rent a spring compressor and do it yourself. I personally wouldnt feel comfortable with it but a lot of people are more hardened that I am. p,subaru,cm5mbrx,1,t5_2rdhg

Major boost creep in th and th all seasons I live in Maryland. temps hit s to low s during summer. I can only get the pedal a little more than halfway down in th and about a third in th without spiking psi and getting a fuel cut.

Bank fees aside which are subsidized by loyalty discounts and things like that the lease can be used as a hedge to prevent me from having to sell a BMW thats worth k less than my payoff.

It still has the aftermarket downpipe so I might as well put an exhaust on it love how the car sounds when you open the pipes a bit. Other than the exhaust my car is back to bone stock but Im not sure about the ECU. My nearest big city is Atlanta and Ive priced a tune from a shop down there. They quoted me  plus a cobb accessport.

3772504,0,t3_33mh7v,So I love all things Subaru even boring ones like the Outback .i. Dont get me wrong I appreciate this car it is brand new and capable in its intended space. But it is certainly not a hotrod like we commonly see in this subreddit. But after adding the roof basket and the factory door trim I am really starting to like the look of the car more. I didnt go for the factory  wheels because mine is a .i Premium not the Limited nor the .R. Rather expensive to add either and I was not  in love with the coke bottle look on the s.The  alloy wheels I have are not terrible though and with a little Plasti Dip I think I could really improve the look. Ditto for the chrome grill which I would likely black out. So here are some mockups which one looks the best?Original  Gold and chrome grill  Deep Gold and blacked out grill  Bronze and blacked out grill  Full blackout  Pardon the quick and dirty chop job and yes I am aware that I may not be able to match the mockups to actual paint colors but this at least gives me an idea of what it might look like. Edit added an anthracite version  ,subaru,cqmak98,3,t5_2rdhg
3773770,0,t3_33msx2,Outback and Forrester are very different from the needs of a WRX. Just be honest with yourself. If you want racecar then no CVT because racecar. If you just want an awesome daily driver then CVT in no way ruins the car. Ive had one in my crosstrek for two years now. There is a slight delay but once you are used to it most situations you just hit the gas a half second earlier getting on freeway or passing. If youre trying to jump a light itll let you down but for practical use no. Plus you sit right where you want on the power curve not so great racing from a stop but again getting on the highway or passing a slower car the things most people actually DO in their cars you would be surprised what continuos peak power can do even in a crosstrek. Test drive the CVT and dont just bow to testosterone fueled stick obsession living in a traffic filled city fixed me of that. Drive what you like but be aware new thrills fade shifting in traffic is forever. ,subaru,cqmfrf8,5,t5_2rdhg
3773877,0,t1_cqmftbp,Yeah you could totally add all of the LSDs and DCCD bigger brembo brakes plus a bullet proof transmission for ! Wait. Thats pretty expensive to add.

While the stock fueling can probably handle it Im not much a fan of good enough when it comes to fueling. Its nice to have some wiggle room. Cant go wrong with a Walbro lph pump and some ccmin  for bonus wiggle room injectors. If you have the stock downpipe you might consider upgrading to a bellmouth pipe.

4028524,0,t3_36m134,Ive got it on my car.  Its louder than stock but not annoying.  The tone could stand to be a bit deeper but it makes the back end look so much better since it fills the rear diffuser better and quality of the welds are second to none. The stock system had a drone to it when you lift off the throttle at certain speeds and Im happy to say the Cobb doesnt do that at all.I got the Cobb exhaust hangers with this purchase and while they are definitely a more solid build they make putting the exhaust on a lot more tricky since you need to get them in the holes perfectly and really have to exert lot of forcewiggling to get them on.

Unequal length headers have the issue that the puffs of air could collide with each other in the exhaust and create turbulence and back flow slowing the flow out and possibly reducing power. Listen to some comparison videos equal length headers have a smoother flow into the turbo and less choppy pressure buildup. Yay Volumetric Efficiency!! ,subaru,crvg2um,2,t5_2rdhg

4212881,0,t1_cs0g0ph,Depends on the tune. Tactrix cable would be the best bet on restoring it to  stock. Not sure if a cobb would do that once the car is married to another tuner.  Tactrix is an open source ecu tuner and that would be your best bet over a cobb tuner for that car cause the community has pretty much got it down after  years of tuning.  Bone stock is preferable but if the ecu has been modded it depends on what its modded for. If it was modded for cat back exhaust thats fine long as its still got the cat back but if it was stage  or more then you will have issues with it running right.  Basically intake and exhaust you will be fine as they are generally not harmful mods. But if its got downpipe or high flow cats once again lifts are awesome then the cars gonna have issues without the tune on it.  Do you have the ad for the car handy? Being able to see that might help a bit. Dealers change that shit all the time once they get the car in. ,subaru,cs0gcp9,1,t5_2rdhg

4290155,0,t3_3a44hj,With the year and mileage of that car I would make sure the head gaskets arent leaking take it to your mechanic and get the car inspected.I am a tech at a Subaru shop and we commonly have customers bring in cars they are planning to buy so we can do an inspection it costs about an hour of labor usually and you can probably talk the car dealer into taking the cost of the inspection off of the sale price if you buy the car.If they find something wrong with the car and you end up having to eat the  for the inspection its still cheaper than buying something and having a major issue come up later.,subaru,cs9805u,2,t5_2rdhg

Its not any more expensive then if you went on your own AND you have an inbetweener who knows the ropes who can help guide you through your insurance journey.Edit I would strongly advise against going under your familys insurance. There are pros and cons but mostly cons where I stand. Take it from me. Up in Canada if youre caught going  km over the speed limit they take your car on the roadside and call it racing.

4453836,0,t1_csrrzba,Ok well the Lancer GTS is FWD and makes hp which means its in the same league as a Civic or Corolla but very slightly faster. Im not sure what makes you think that it would handle well in the snow. It will handle it as well as any other FWD car. What also led to confusion and why I thought you actually meant Evo was that you said the Lancer had a doubleclutch gearbox. It does NOT and if the owner is telling you that then theyre lying to you. Just because something has paddleshifters doesnt mean its a DSG. The GTS only has manual automatic or CVT so its one of the latter two .Also as uLeadfootYT said the current owner seems to have put a lot of rice into a car slow car. Youd probably get laughed at for pretending that you have an Evo.Now that I know the truth you should definitely be going with the WRX. It will be much much faster and actually do well in the snow. Plus the hatch gives a ton of utility. The WRX is the easy choice here.,subaru,css38li,3,t5_2rdhg

The head unit even upgraded to  inches on the limited is junk its slow the volume goes up and down contantly even with speed control off I could go on.IF anything im buying the kicker upgraded speakers on amazon for cheaper than the dealer and found a nice double din kenwood for  with apple play and android on basically turns it into you phone so you will have navigation and then add a small sub I might just get the kicker with the amp from subaru since it fits nice in the trunk.Save the cash use the  or whatever to build a much nicer stereo you will be pissed wasying it on what it comes with even the upgraded harmon kardon one with nav,subaru,ctagah7,1,t5_2rdhg

I got a lot of free shit though out of it. Free detail which usually cost .. A bunch of stuff free. What happen though there were  dock doors. And each lane could probably hold four cars. Well I chose the middle lane and a car pulled up behind me that a customer was picking up. I was first in line so the porter moved my car forward to a different lane. Meaning he pulled out of the garage and moved over and back into the other lane. Well they have automatic sensors. The sensors in the front tell the garage door to open and the sensors in the back tell the garage to close. Its a one way street type deal. So he pulled forward to exit the garage and back in. Well once he hit that backend sensor the garage door started to close and sure enough it smashed my roof. ,subaru,ctcu7sl,2,t5_2rdhg

By doing this firms are able to increase profits and surplus in the market. What allows them to do this is that one segment that is less sensitive to price changes and thus can be charged a higher price. Many other companies do this. For example cereal you would find in a big chain store like Target is sold under a different name in stores like Aldi. By doing this the producer is able to increase profits and those that want to consume the product but cant at the higher price now can.,subaru,ctettrm,3,t5_2rdhg

My  WRX with  STi tranny was tacking around k on the highway not nice. Also you should look into breakin periods on the WRX and STi. Many tuners suggest changing the oil as soon as you buy it. There are many theories out there as to what you should do with this so it would be best to look more into it.

I get in the car plug in my iPhone and get going. It automatically runs the music that was already playingin standby.On the flipside if you decide the CarPlay feature isnt for you I really like the HU in a whole. I used the HU as a Bluetooth receiver with my iPhone prior to the CarPlay update and it ran very well. GPS is spot on continues to be updated by Pioneer and improved sound immediately in my vehicle although I recommend adding on an amp during installation.Apple maps does a leave a little to be desired Apple is working on adding all the features that Google maps has.All in all I am very pleased with my purchase I would recommend to a friend.A few pictures in my STiFeel free to ask any questions.EditGRAMMAR,subaru,cua20f6,2,t5_2rdhg

Two of the dealerships were very slow getting back to us and it ended up that the third was closest to the price we wanted so we continued negotiating from there. Once they got down to the price we were looking for took  days going back and forth we called to order the car and put a non refundable  deposit. They gave us the estimated arrival date though it ended up coming in  weeks early. Overall we were still able to haggle on the price and it was a much better experience than buying our previous car off the lot.

5179146,0,t3_3lxyl6,Oil starvation is usually what kills a highmileage EJ. By this point unless youre lucky it probably burns a bit of oil. Until you have a handle on how much check it religiously. Clean your MAF with every oil change. Its easy and CRC sells a product just for this. This may sound counterintuitive but you should probably run it up over k RPMs at least once a week if daily driven. If the previous owner never did this however doing so could trigger latent issues. The transmission has a reputation for being weak but a lot of that is just because of how a small portion of owners drive. If you dont launch it and drive smoothly it can usually hold hp without drama. Mine is the supposedly weakest AA transmission and it has been doing just fine with around hp for quite a while. Your car is probably running at hp by this point so I wouldnt worry about it. ,subaru,cva9z5e,5,t5_2rdhg

5189131,0,t1_cvbd1q6,gtAny special consideration when a matte finish dip?As far as application  no. Its the most basic of the dips since Plasti Dip Spray the sprayable gallons default to a matte finish.gtDoes it attract lint or need special stuff when washing it?Dust settles more easily on it. Or to be accurate dirt that would otherwise fall or blow off of the slick surface of a clear coat will not fall or be blown off of matte dip. So youll want to keep it clean more often. You dont need anything special. I use simple green but most auto wash detergents are fine.gtYou said youre in FL but would a dip last longer or few years in cold environments?Plasti Dip International rates the duration of the product holding its properties namely the elasticitypeelability at  years. Sun exposure and extremely low humidity shorten the period. So places with lots of sun andor very dry air will shorten the life of the product.

5412490,0,t3_3p5nyy,No doubt the manual is more fun and faster than the CVT. Banging through gears is an incredibly satisfying feeling and will give you the most control over the car. The CVT has the ability to keep the revs in the boost range constantly as you push it as opposed to the manual where you have to shift and drop boost. The main draw back to the CVT is that it will always want to be efficient and will be constantly adjusting the gear ratio. This will cause some power loss whereas the manual directly links the engine and the drive train so you can use every horse you have. Driving stick isnt hard but the clutch and transmission on the WRX is very sporty so it will be more difficult to drive than an little Hyundai or something. The nice part is the new WRX helps you relax with things like hill assist. Wont roll back on a hill so long as the clutch is engaged when you take your foot off the brake I do lots of city driving and there are some days where I get sick of shifting but those are few and far between and the joy of driving far outweighs any benefit of the CVT. ,subaru,cw3i6qi,1,t5_2rdhg

5546531,0,t3_3r3ngw, of the WRXSTIs were beat on. They were designed to be driven like that but that doesnt make it bulletproof. It doesnt have to be launched every day to be considered beat on but Ive seen many threads of people who just got a used WRXSTI and they say stuff like And the previous owner never even took it above  RPM! I cringe hard.Theyre easy to overpay k for a  year old k car is overpaying even if its what they go for. Theyre also easy to break. Im not saying theyre made out of glass but lots of owners dont know when they last changed their oil and they throw parts on without researching. Even something as small as a highflow air filter like KampNs can be dangerous.Theres a large percentage of people in relation to other cars that drop k on a clean WRXSTI only to find that  miles later theyre stuck with a k repair bill.Not to scare you away though. I would not consider these unreliable. If you take care of them they will take care of you but the problem is most people dont take care of them.Do a lot of reading because there are  million threads answering all the questions you have. When you think you read all the threads you need to keep reading because you only read  of them. NASIOC is a good place to start read all the Help me buy a WRXSTI threads.Take the car to a mechanic that knows Subarus buy from a reputable place and DO YOUR RESEARCH.  Research does not mean post a thread about a question that was answered before. Google it read the correct post that was posted  years ago etc. All the answers are out there and you shouldnt be trusting a bunch of idiots myself included to spoon feed you answers.,subaru,cwkljvh,3,t5_2rdhg

5821583,0,t3_3uxpqx, it is EVAP related. Somewhere on the cars EVAP system there is a blockage to the vent or a fault in a sensor reporting tank pressure. More likely going to be a replacement canister installed so be prepared to possibly make a couple trips if they have to order what they need.OOhhhh. Frozen lines or ice in the canister.Frozen drain line  good possibility.From the FSM my interpretationWhen the car is cruising the evap system periodically opens the purge valve to draw the gas fumes which are trapped in the evap system charcoal canister into the engine where they are burned off. It does this by opening the purge valve that connects the intake manifold to the canister. When the canister is being purged outside air is supposed to be drawn into the canister. This path also has a valve drain valve which is normally open and a filter. During the purge action the evap system monitors the pressure in the fuel tank. If all is well the pressure will change only slightly due to the gasladen air being drawn to the intake manifold by engine vacuum. However the pressure should not fall significantly because the airfumes drawn to the manifold should be replaced by air drawn in through the drain filter and drain valve. However if within the first  seconds after the purge valve is opened the pressure vacuum in the fuel tank changes more than the design limit this indicates that replacement air is not coming in through the filter as it should. This can then trigger the P.However while theres usually one specific issue that causes a code its not unusual for other issues to also cause a particular code so some troubleshooting is often still necessary.,subaru,cxiqgdf,2,t5_2rdhg

6123996,0,t3_3zfrpx,Nothing special for an alignment needed. Any tire shop can do it. However I would suggest max front camber they can get to be even in the front. Usually this isnt much so it wont have a negative affect on wearing the insides of your new tires.I find mine only having a very very small additional wear when you get down to the very end of tire life. Theyll be the first to start showing cords but the rest of the tire is toast and mainly even after that.However with that said in three years of ownership springsstruts changed two sets of summer tires and one set of winter tires later... I still havent gotten an alignment and everything is spot on in terms of wear. Honestly if your tires a wearing even as they are now I wouldnt get an alignment.No comment on TPMS as none of my cars are new enough to have that... lol.,subaru,cylqgh6,1,t5_2rdhg

6439975,0,t1_czld183,So Im informed its  of market value w my insurance but thats besides the point I think. I assume its already considered totaled even if I change the body shop and get a real nd quote and at this point unfortunately theres little to no way to remove the salvaged title. Or can I actually argue to have it moved and reevaluated? That would be great actually if possible. And if after a real inspection there the costs jump to near the same well then I wouldnt argue the cost any further.Yep the k estimate is quite steep and Im sure Im getting a little cheated here. Theres painting costs for scratches completely unrelated to the original accident like the quarter panel on the opposite side of the car. Theres at least k worth of such charges.I have item by item list from each and nd place is missing a few nonfrivolous items which can run it up k sure but saves some using recycled parts for body wchih Im fine with and has a good  lower hours estimate which Im comparing same item by item. Again though Im not an expert maybe enticing me with lower prices only to jump up after completion but reviews of the nd place online are great current body shop not so much.,subaru,czlfkh3,1,t5_2rdhg

6479521,0,t1_czpi0j4,No worries I welcome the questions! I have the hatchback. The Mrs and I find it more useful than the sedan for tossing gear and groceries into. It doesnt have the same space as the Outback wagon though so if you are going to need lots of interior cargo space the Outback is a much better choice. If you dont mind a roof rack and cargo carrier though you can balance out in that regard. We also have the black interior and it makes it feel smaller and a bit cramped so Id suggest the grey or tan if available. My wife disagrees here though so it may just be my perception. We also have the base model with a manual transmission so we are lacking a few of the add ons of the higher packages like paint matched side mirrors heated side mirrors side mirror turn signal they sure put a lot of stuff into those nowadays right? and premium sound system. Still have the in dash screen with backup camera and apps though which is great. Ours came with the steel rims which I plan on keeping for snow tires while putting summer tires on a nicer set of alloys.Oh and you can also get the new Imprezas in the Pearl White color which I am told is new for that model for . ,subaru,czpj3ba,1,t5_2rdhg

6624781,0,t1_d042vhi,Yes there is a matching heat sheild on the top side of the pipe. Because of the magic of rust there is no way to determine the status of the top shield. The shields sheet metal could have corroded through near the fasteners and fallen off or it could have corroded in a way that makes bond tighter to the pipe. There is really nothing to worry about. A car that has heat shields falling off because of rust will definitely have more important maintenance issues to think about.

6779515,0,t1_d0kqfvz,I guess you could say that.Salt is spread on the street in its solid form rock salt. Its broken down into pieces that are usually smaller than  and just dumped into the back of trucks. That feeds into a rotating hopper that spins the salt out. The hopper is usually electronically controlled so they can put more or less salt down as they see fit. For example at intersections theyll add more salt so people can actually stop without sliding though intersecting traffic. If youve ever used a hand held or push grass seed spreader that you dump the seed into and rotate the handlepush to spray the seed out over an area its the same concept. Just a lot bigger and instead of planting grass it gives cars cancer. ,subaru,d0kqq30,21,t5_2rdhg

Definitely no cutout there. You would be much better off putting a little ten inch sealed box in the trunk. Shouldnt take up much space at all and will sound much better. You get into some weird issues putting aftermarket subwoofers in stock rear deck locations anyways most subwoofers cant be run in an infinite baffle set up like that. Here is a very decent system for under Front Speakers  Subwoofer Subwoofer Box Amplifier LOC Budget a minimum of  for install. This will be a killer system. Super clean and plenty loud.

Im having a good bit of knock on my  and a local shop says they wouldnt be surprised if its the same problem. If Subaru is just putting out the fix for the s now how did they have the fix for the early s. My  was built almost a year ago now so it seems like Subaru wouldnt have had the fix ready at that time and theyre just waiting for s to go on sale to recall s. Mostly speculation but Im getting a good amount of knock and nobody can figure out why.I dont know enough about tuning to tell you that but since Subarus fix is an ecu reflash then its likely a tune would help.

6987092,0,t1_d185277,FMIC is larger cools more air typically installed when you upgrade to a larger turbo that can move more air. They also get more DIRECT air flow as it is perpendicular to the flow of air hitting the front of the car and exposed. They look freakin awesome.Cons are increased turbo lag and longer charge time due to it being larger and longer piping having to mod your front end to fit it and they are much more susceptible to road damage being completely open and low to the ground I have an upgraded TMIC on my WRX Perrin with a PTP Lava Turbo blanket with heat shield on top and it does me just fine! TMIC is always cool to the touch unless the car has been sitting for a while but then cools again. I can go out for an extended drive get out and put my hand on the heat shield.

7041292,0,t1_d1e5hid,What you are seeing is perfectly normal. The stock fa dits have over boost and then taper off. So you see your peak being  from giving it gas at a lower rpm. So it shoots up then the ecu corrects itself and tapers back down to  which is should be. Subaru has confirmed this is normal. As for oem being accurate. I have seen the access port reads a difference of any were from x. psi. So even if this Rex is seeing  psi the accesport could be reading it as . psi. Which is still way to much. Stage  has a tendency of something called boost creep. It will slowly keep adding boost to the car. Typically a electronic boost controller and a tune will fix that. ,subaru,d1ehk5o,1,t5_2rdhg

7104983,0,t3_4cvbkw,Honest opinion from a  year old who was cheap through high school and college. With used cars with over k youre really taking a roll of the dice. Anything over about k starts becoming a money pit.All ours have about k k etc and things are getting worn down and needing replacing. I have a buddy who picked up an Outback wagon with k and hes needed to be redo just about everything including the engine at that mileage. Every other day something else is breaking... most recently the brake lines just gave out. Before the suspension was completely trashed. Timing belt slipped.Id consider something with under k if you can. ,subaru,d1lq1dg,5,t5_2rdhg

It was too much for me though it seems to be the most popular aftermarket size.As for the x.  being too aggressive of a fitment thats getting subjective. The fitment is identical to the large number of individuals out there running mm spacers on the stock wheels. My current setup is still less aggressive than one of the most popular sizes for aftermarket wheels. So to me it isnt too aggressive. To each their own.

7666444,0,t1_d3dhd6m,Most cars have not enough camber stock.  You want .. mid corner on street tires and around  on race tires generally. Most cars run  or .. stock to reduce tire ware. The only non exotic car I can think of running more is the z it runs . camber and toes  in  degrees. They had to stop that on non nismo cars since people wined about tires going unevenly.|Stanced Cara run more camber and stretch tires. If you stretch tires then when the weight transfers you roll the side wall and are not driving on tread if you have negative camber low profile tires make it even worse. That is why it is dangerous if they just did some camber even more than  it would be same until around  with proper fitted tires. ,subaru,d3dmpya,4,t5_2rdhg

8097519,0,t3_4q54li,What is your intent with the car? Is it going to be a daily driver? Daily driver but also taken through some tight turns on the weekend? Track car? The upgrades in the limited trim level of the WRX never appealed to me. I never used a sunroof power seats are irrelevant unless you share the car and I hate leather seats because it has less traction than the Alcantara gets too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter.If all its going to be is a daily driven car get a lower trim WRX. If you intend to push the car hard or take it to the track Id recommend the STI. I say this not because the STI is ridiculously stiffer suspension it is tighter for sure but I dont think its as rough as some people make it out to be.

If you wish to buy it back they give you the cash value of the car preaccident minus the deductible minus the scrap value they would have received plus any other associated costs or fees.However in this case being that some of the parts would be salvageable like the wheels which are worth some good money it might be worth buying it back and parting some pieces of it out then scraping it. ,subaru,d5g4jw4,1,t5_2rdhg

Definitely at least  RPMs. As you get more comfortable you will learn to start lower and it will punish the clutch less. Plus it will teach you the clutch point faster.

8470518,0,t1_d609a98,I can see your dilemma honestly my predicament is sort of the same as yours just replace STI with WRX. I want to get the best version possible in a short amount of time. Though if I had the chance to get a NEW  WRX I may be more inclined to get that version but I REALLY love the body of that one.Anyway back to you its a hard choice. I think you just kinda need to force your brain that best although it exists is always kinda subjective because each generation is going to introduce a new best. In truth I told you to get the STI but at the same time I am afraid you may have buyers remorse if you get the STI now and then witness the new STI with all the revamped stuff. Final verdict I would say wait just live your life knowing that you will get the STI in  see if you can handle it and it doesnt drive you insane lol Im going insane atm.  Let some time pass sleep on it dont think about it for a day. If it really becomes bothersome just jump ship and get the STI in its current form its in its best version right now believe it or not only that when the next Gen comes out that Gen is going to be its best. In terms of the oil guzzling issue thingy there was a lawsuit being confirmed recently with imprezas foresters and I believe outbacks from the years  or something....I just found the link and it looks like I was confused as the year of these models seem to be when the cars were using the EJ .i engine though I am not entirely sure. The WRX isnt listed though so its fine. Here is the link In reference to the face lift confirmed thingy Ive been following planetsubaru for a bit and theyve been sport on about the  WRX and  Impreza so I am going to guess they will be spot on with the  WRX also. Heres the link read it and weep like I did lol I know I know it states  wrxsti but it talks about the  WRX briefly and usually the wrx and sti come out togethet rihht? Hmm unless I missed this they are claiming the next WRX generation will be ...not ...makes sense its  years not sure why I got  stuck in my brain. This is all speculation of course but I just cant see Subaru making the new impreza and STI on the new platform in about the same year. Subaru has plans to make a lot or all of their models on the global platform by  so  is certainly the max. We really dont know oh check out this really good comment someone made speculating about the newer wrx and sti  offers some good insight...while also causing you to lose more hair because he talks about Subaru possibly up sizing the STI engine back to .liters...though remember its still not confirmed.And going back just try and think about the trade offs you get which each gen. With the newer STI that comes out whenever I can imagine it will use EL headers so the tradeoff you will have is the boxer rumble. Thats about it I guess everything else is going to or should be an improvement.READ so you may hate me or love me for this in that pernalink I sent u the guy also posted this  and in this they are saying that the STI would come out two years from now in . So I guess  isnt much of a stretch. Hmm...the  model would come out Around MayJune of  right? At this point I would say just wait for the  bro.,subaru,d60cs6f,1,t5_2rdhg

He was going way too fast and went into the guard rail then back across all lanes to the divider. I didnt even get to finish my sentence about how foolish they were being racing and they crashed.

8754332,0,t1_d6zmmp0,Ive owned  Evos and  STIs. The Evo has a much better powerplant the G. The motor block is iron and is super strong. The motor itself has been around much much longer than the EJ. The only thing the STI can hold over the Evo is the stronger transmission which on the Evo can be rebuilt with custom gearing for around  with all the bells and whistles. Really in comes down to what car has the better motor and the G is a much better engine than the EJ from a performance standpoint. Also things like being able to easily change the cams in an Evo by just popping the valve cover off where as on the STI you have to pull the engine. I prefer working on the Evo every single time over the STI. With that being said I am a current  STI owner because I wanted a fun daily driver and I dont care about speed. ,subaru,d6zy6hm,1,t5_2rdhg

Pour a bunch of water over the ignition coils and HT leads and look for sparks and listen for a change in the sound of the engine. If that doesnt affect it pour a bunch of water over any sensors or connectors that look suspect. If wetting anything affects how the engine runs then youve found your problem. Most likely some ignition or engine management component that isnt waterproof anymore and is shorting out.Protip get a friend or a brick to hold the revs up around .k.

Great places for this include but are not limited to back roads if you have a solid light set up. Can also have a mate hold the light higher connected to a stand also s great place is the top of parking garages with a nice back drop.

There is no better way to get to know your car than by wrenching on it and the Subaru is one of the friendlier cars to work on.I do my own mods and maintenance. If its something I havent done before I research the hell out of it and find out if I need any special tools or extra hands. Next if its something I havent done and the modrepair is supposed to take say  hours then I budget  hours. That way Im not in a hurry and less likely to break something or miss a step. Another valuable tool I have is the OBDII reader. It was about  on Amazon and connects to my phone by bluetooth. This allows me to read CELs and diagnose the issue.,subaru,d90vwby,1,t5_2rdhg

9610536,0,t1_d9xddv9,Im in the same boat with a polluting diesel fraudulently sold to me as environmentally responsible by the lying scumbags at Volkswagen.  Ask me how I feel about VAG vehicles now...Anyway the Crosstrek gets the highest reliability ratings for any of the Subaru models but I found it unpleasant at highway speeds due to wind noise and a kindof agricultural quality to the engine sound.  The new  Imprezas are getting good early reviews said to be designed to improve refinement and reduce noise compared to previous Imprezas.  Your check from VW should get you far along to a pretty nice Impreza.  Once my check comes Ill be buying a WRX but the ride on those is a lot busier on the highway if cruising is your thing.  It makes up for it by being an absolute hoot to drive on the winding back roads where I live.  Costwise I think the parts costs are similar so its a matter of frequency of repair and severity of failure.  Suburu went through a bad patch with engine oil consumption problems and a lot of engine problems at higher mileage.  I think the latest design e.g. FA engines are likely to have solved those problems.  Hope this helps.,subaru,d9xp0zv,1,t5_2rdhg

I drive all the cars except the rat rod and personally I find them not very enjoyable as everyday driving cars. I love driving them on weekends or charity cruises but I much prefer my Outback for every day driving. In the other cars one miscalculation on my part means Im sideways up the road or I constantly stall the corolla in the first few mins of driving it due to the brass button clutch and it annoys me. But the good old Subie I can start her up put her in drive and away we go with no problem. No changing gears every  seconds in traffic no accidental drifting over the speed limit and best of all its comfy. I know every single noise it makes how it handles every type of road in every weather and I can almost go into autopilot. I dont have to look at any stereo or airconheater controls and I know the exact dimensions of my car for merging and I can parallel park it using only my passenger side mirror. Ive heard nothing but bad things about the cyls which is why I wasnt overly keen on the Outback to start with until I realised it was a .

So I accelerated instead to jump into the ditch on the other side of the road to avoid a headon or a side hit my side had the metal barriers and there was a couple cars following me but the oncoming vehicle that was going very fast still managed to hit me. We both collided on our right front wheels and passenger doors. To add insult to injury in about  minutes after the accident road cleaning equipment showed up and brushed everything  snow debris off the road. That is why you dont see much on the road BTW. Police took their time they asked if anyone was hurt there were no injuries. So we waited for about  hours in freezing cold for them to arrive. Families were sent off of course. When the cops finally arrived they said that we were lucky.

I also swapped a  speed dual range from a Loyale which is a lot nicer to shift than the mushy  speed dual range. The EJ is just running on nearly the complete harness from the donor Legacy with a few things cut out of it for space. Im going to swap it to an OBD ECU and harness this spring so I can use a bluetooth adapter and an Android tablet for digital gauges. Right now the tach coolant temp and voltage gauge are the only ones that work. The speedo should work on the  speed but the plastic threads on my speedo cable are stripped and it wont stay in the transmission. The gas gauge doesnt work because of some wire rot back there Im going to install a fuel cell to fix that and the leaky gas tank. And the oil pressure doesnt work without retrofitting the EA oil pressure sensor onto the EJ block. With the thread adapters and headache needed to make it work Im going to just use an Autometer oil pressure gauge instead.,subaru,ddh0162,4,t5_2rdhg
10675614,0,t3_5snq4a,Id also just check out a few other vehicles just you can gauge the feel of another car and how the Impreza feels  is the Crosstrek in the case you would ever need the additional ground clearance but almost the same car as the Impreza.  The engine for those years  are all the same only difference would be weight depending on trim and also the  were the refresh years that had small exterior changes and a newer infotainment system.  PZEVULEVetc. are just emissions which vary by your state e.g. mine is PZEV since Im in California but realistically I wouldnt worry too much about this.  Always always always check vehicle history see if they records of maintenance like regular oil changes tire thread etc.  If you can pay a rd party mechanic with a good reputation to check out the car before you buy it.  Mileage can range but Id be comfortable buying a car with under k no problem.A few things I heardread about the  years was possibly oil consumption with Subarus FB engines however with my  Impreza I havent experience any of that heard there is a fix maybe?.  Road noise is a little loud but not too bad.  As a daily driver its great average about MPG mixed driving a ton of room for a compact car and amazing visibility.  If you can knab a  try it out they had the newer infotainment system standard with those . screen for BasePremium and the  with the Limited trim.

So instead I waited for them to plow my road so I could get a video of me pulling out of even higher snow.Then the problem arose the borough never plowed my road. So instead me and the old man had to come up with a plan of attack to dig ourselves out. So we opted to dig his van out first after fixing the broken clutch in our snowblower and digging out my uncle and a few other neighbors. That process took us a few hours and in that time the lowest layer of snow turned to ice.So we threw some ashes down and I carefully pulled out and around the  ft pile of snow we made from clearing our sidewalk and street. Not interesting to see but anything that puts me in a driver seat is okay. I might try to go out later and get sideways but Im fucking beat. Will update if I do.,subaru,dexmzsf,4,t5_2rdhg

Of course there are times when a car is a lemon or something just happens. But if you tune your car and it blows up on you then you got a shitty tune. ,subaru,dez5wiv,3,t5_2rdhg

But even then at  throttle op shouldnt be anywhere close to full boost. Do you know what is changed to achieve higher boost? Ill give you a hint  only ONE table and its not boost targets.

11534808,0,t1_dg3fdtf,Honestly just google  wrx headlight disassembly or retrofit. There will probably be some guides on nasioc or hidplanet. Baking and blacking headlights is a very popular thing to do on cars these days. Minimal tools are required. Why do you want to change the headlights? Just the look or are you hoping for more light output. Where are you located. There may be a retrofitter in your area that can do the work for you if youre uncomfortable doing it yourself. ,subaru,dg3h14a,2,t5_2rdhg
