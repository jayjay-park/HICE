8741525,0,t1_d6y2k29,Im in RGR  . Im holding at least until the next NICS numbers and SWHC earnings. Expecting a least a small pop. Might sell after that to free up some capital. Not expecting a fast enough growth from  to justify holding for the nearterm. I think theyre lacking in innovation and riding their very solid current lineup but everyone already has a  or .  ,wallstreetdd,d6ycc7z,1,t5_3f98v

8812375,0,t1_d76zl22,Everything in your last paragraph is exactly why I thought this was a sure thing after earnings. Kinda disappointing that background checks came back the same day in a less than stellar fashion. Otherwise I have to believe we would have seen a little something positive. Agree with your other points too. If you can hold through the next couple months there should be some exciting times. Theres also the military contract deal looming on the horizon. Would be interesting to see what would happen if Smith amp Wesson is chosen for final  testing. If they ever get around to it. ,wallstreetdd,d774lyd,1,t5_3f98v

9347810,0,t1_d8zqfmo,I havent run into anything that really fits my needs but Ive got a few ideas and will be working towards a good solution. I go more indepth into it in this reply and will have a proper explanation of where Im going to take this in a few days.gt This must be a ton of work tracking these like this...Its a lot of work and its very hard to follow. My formatting is obtuse doesnt handle things like differentiating between buyingselling and is just hard to read in general. Its not fair to me and its not fair to my readers. ,wallstreetdd,d90whke,1,t5_3f98v
