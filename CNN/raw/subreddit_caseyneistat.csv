4574395,0,t3_3dntmy,I get the concept and how its in line with his principles of just do it and I think thats great. But I think you have to ask whether theres a big enough market of people who want to share their lives unfiltered and a market for people who want to see others lives unfiltered through  second videos.Personally no interest. Everything I share is heavily curatededited. Not because Im hiding anything but because I want to put my best work out there. I think the idea of wanting to throw everything out there and see what sticks appeals to a certain audience but as you can see from his beme meetup videos its definitely a younger and not very diverse crowd. Its all people who are huge extroverts and social media hounds.I hope it goes well because we all know how much work Casey puts into this. Hopefully it will be a huge viral hit within certain audiences. But I dont think it will as mainstream as something like twitter or instagram. Then you have the whole issue where its not really different from other options out there. I dont know I guess well see what happens.,caseyneistat,ct77m9l,8,t5_2y8ps

4833854,1,t1_cu3tpmj,It is not about using timelapse . Its how you use it and incorporate it into your video . By your logic  what is a Stanley Kubrick movie  or a Steven Spielberg one they just use cameras  actors  dialog nothing different . Its how you implement an idea or incorporate a tool that makes it unique to you or Kubrick or Spielberg . Using a timelapse is fine  he is not the first to do so  but Casey incorporates it into his movies in a certain way in the beginning with the title and in shots like intros where he approaches as an element to an established shot and talks to the camera  also throughout his movies they roll at different times with forwarding and reversing to music . Now that is unique to Casey no one else does that he has been doing it since he started his very first vlog or previous movies on his channel . No that someone else that you havent watched his videos isnt just using a timelapse his incorporating it the same way Casey does the same thing that makes a Casey Neistat movie .. well a Casey Neistat movie . That here is copying from someone else like or not . Combine that with other elements unique to someone else that are incorporated in the same way and you have a copycat . This here isnt a discussion about how great Caseys videos are at the end of the day he is a good movie maker but not a great one by any means  Its about people feeling ok with taking ideas and presenting them as their own . ,caseyneistat,cu3uh4i,-3,t5_2y8ps

6732527,1,t1_d0fozvg,There are a number of reasons why Casey is keeping his space. One would be the sentimental factor. Thats where he made his first big break and created most of his content. I would say most of his cherished moments of his film work has been created in that space.Secondly he still uses the space. He may not show it all the time. Keep in mind a day has  hours and the VLOGs are generally around  minutes heavily edited. He isnt the only one that uses the space either. I think he hires interns from time to time to work in that space on the extra computers.He still creates creative videos from time to time. Not long ago he planned that snowboarding video from there did the Aladdin boosted board prep there as well as new projects like the one upcoming with Samsung. I dont know Casey personally but watching his vlogs I get the feeling he always keeps himself busy so I dont think he will stop being creative and not use that space. I think the whole reason he is revamping the studio is so he can get MORE out of it than he currently is.Lastly the guy has a lot of money so I dont think he would need to sell it. Hes selling his house in New London CT which should help him out financially if he does need the help.,caseyneistat,d0fpadc,3,t5_2y8ps

6827600,0,t1_d0pyjkh,I really dont agree that Neistat has original style. Neistat has original content and thats it. His style is not original but his use of the style in daily vlogging is sorta newits a thin argument.The originality issue has primarily arisen when Jacksgap produced several essentiallythesame videos as Neistat. Also some youtubers produce videos that are sort of like Neistats videos including having the same music. However their content is original because it is theirs. So I would say that they are not copycatting off Neistat anymore than Neistat is reproducing Tom Sachs work.If you are going to push it this far I would say that Neistat owes Sachs everything. I cant say that Neistat learned a single thing on his own including how to emulate other filmmakers like Wes Anderson without Sachs help. To me this makes his level of originality very low.But his level of entertainment is pretty good regardless of whether hes original.

Then a lot of graft and learning clever techniques highly recommend  pencil method which I only came across recently would have really sped up my development. Seeing past what your drawing and drawing purely what you see not what you think you see this is a known effect! is the most important thing to capture realistic portraits. Remember that youre making shapes with clever shading not drawing lines. Skin textures come naturally with the right paper Strathmore  Series Vellum Paper is a good one and affordable. This is on A Arches watercolour paper but wouldnt recommend it for practice. Grid method is the most manageable way to draw a larger portrait such as this but its time consuming!. For what its worth this was one of my first drawings a couple of years ago a few months into starting drawing  I was never a naturally gifted drawer and thats after a fair few failed attempts before.

Some might even say he is a pathological liar. And he lies about stupid stuff too like never flying Emirates before or never flying a doubledecker airplane before.I think lying is dangerous... especially when you achieve hero status...Because many will buy into these lies and fail miserably.I know tons of vloggers who have been at this just when Casey went daily.

Im pretty sure it was always a joint venture after they left Tom Sachs. If Casey didnt take liberties on his storytelling I wouldnt even question it but he does lie a lot in his paid speaking gigs to make the story sound better. ,caseyneistat,d8xptwn,1,t5_2y8ps

Work is play to him so while he hates and bitches about some long meetings or unfun things he largely has a blast editing videos making things and getting things done.

Almost  million subs and the high fashion world is into him...I would say based on his fame alone he falls under attractive. He wasnt a model or a movie star fame gained by creating unique thought provoking content in a new digital age.So your question based on his fame was already answered before you asked.When you say hes not attractive to you do you find him physically ugly? Because of that you cant see the value in what he does or why he is famous?Talent is difficult to measure on a scale or good and bad looking.Also majority of famous people arent ugly...I would never say that. Just saying you can BE famous and not attractive. I tend not to call people ugly as beauty comes in many shapes and sizes outside physical conventions.Mind if I ask how old you are? Ball park it if you want t keep it private. Im asking because o sense a very limited perspective due to lack of life experience or understanding...not an insult just trying to understand your logic bomb here.,caseyneistat,d9qzcx7,2,t5_2y8ps

11373249,0,t1_dfk0zot,Just my two cents...I used to follow Casey religiously way before the vlog was even an idea and I can personally say that I liked his work a hell of a lot better then than I do now.I think it really comes down to personal preference but I would much rather see more sporadically released short films on actually interesting topics that he put a lot of time and effort into than daily vlogs with clickbait titles where half the time he seems to be flaunting his wealth andor extremely good fortune in life not that he isnt allowed to be proud of that it just gets a bit old after a while when hes flying first class from LA to NY to do some fancy corporate photoshoot seemingly every other day.Go back and watch any of his movies from  years ago bike lanes chatroulette  dollar bills and tell me that those are not so much more interesting and engaging than Im hanging out with some other famous YouTuber and flying drones or doing some rich person activity that we get every day now. I used to check Caseys channel all the time for new videos back when he valued quality over quantity. Now its more of a routine where if Im bored I might check his channel every week or so to see if hes released anything that looks half as good as what he used to create. Dont get me wrong Im not hating  I was a huge fan of his for the longest time Ive got the yearsold  bill stickers to prove it!  I just hate to see one of my favorite content creators fall off so dramatically in terms of quality.,caseyneistat,dfl4y0t,3,t5_2y8ps
