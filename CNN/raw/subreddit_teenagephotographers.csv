329605,0,t3_1xsyfk,Although I really should I havent taken anything this week.Every time Ive gone out to ride Ive thought I should bring my camera but then decide against it because I know I wont have the time. Or I go out after dark. Its a shame that I cant bring my camera to school because I had the chance for some great photos today but I didnt have a camera. I guess I ought to try to take something before the end of the week. Maybe Ill take my camera skiing with me on Saturday and hope theres a bit more sunlight than last time.,teenagephotographers,cfexnlp,1,t5_2te4a
