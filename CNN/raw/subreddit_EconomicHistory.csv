Forthousands of years the average standard of living seems to have risen very little despite increases in thelevel of technology and large increases in the level of the population. Then after thousands of years of littlechange the level of per capita consumption increased dramatically in less than two centuries. Quantitativeanalysis of the model highlights two factors central to understanding this history. The first is a virtuous circlemore people produce more ideas which in turn makes additional population growth possible. The secondis an improvement in institutions that promote innovation such as property rights the simulated economyindicates that the single most important factor in the transition to modern growth has been the increase inthe fraction of output paid to compensate inventors for the fruits of their labor. ,EconomicHistory,ck151lv,1,t5_2s82c

Yetcollective institutions are fraught with problems of work incentives excessive grain procurement and the like which in oneextreme historical instance had resulted in great tragedyChinas Great Leap Famine. By exploiting the variation in the pace ofagricultural decollectivization among the Chinese provinces during  we test the respective effects of weather shocks thelasting impact of the Great Leap Famine and public goods provision on the villages institutional choice between collective andfamily farming. We find that bad weather at the time of decollectivization had the likely effect of strengthening the collectives butthat effect reverses in provinces that had experienced greater famine severity or had enjoyed better public goods provision.,EconomicHistory,cxq9oqc,1,t5_2s82c
7244771,0,t3_4ehobu,The economy of the United States changed dramatically at the start of the th century. Between  and  U.S. industrial exports jumped from  percent to  percent of total exports. In other words over about a year period there was a reversal in the countrys comparative advantage which changed the policy equilibrium. One of the factors that helped reverse the countrys comparative advantage was the discovery of iron minesPretty cool stuff. I had no idea that iron played an important role in the U.S. becoming a bigger exporter in the beginning of the th century. ,EconomicHistory,d21ofjk,2,t5_2s82c
