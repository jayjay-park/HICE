548654,0,t1_cg2m0zi,Sure.  Im pretty sure my BST can solo the bosses now with spark gear.  The only one that might be interesting is Amphitrite with the changing between physical and magical resistance.,RedditLinkshell,cg2mzm0,1,t5_30out

3281159,0,t3_2wcsvt,Havent give up on this! I dont have everyones name yet as Ive only talked to a handful of you in the game about this but hopefully Ill wrap that part up soon. Im assuming runs are going to be about pm to am EST and Monday through Thursday.Last Friday not going to be a normal day but we made it work last week we got some people together. Not enough for Delve so we did some SKCNM runs together including one win on Difficult for access to  weapons and we got a ton of chapters of I think three different types. A little bit of waiting around while returning folk got their HP crystal they werent warned  I blame myself! but all in all a success.I made a linkshell for this and other endgame related events called Redgame. I thought it would be a good idea to have some place where we can all chat about what events to do without bothering the rest of the shell. Ill try to get a pearl distributed to everyone as soon as possible. I for one dont have a second linkshell so Ill be on Redgame all the time. I dont intend it only to be for us either so if other Redditers are reading feel free to ask for a pearl! Just keep in mind its only for endgame discussion  chat should be kept to the regular Reddit shell whenever possible to keep it active!Hope to see everyone on soon!,RedditLinkshell,cp2a1vb,1,t5_30out
3366251,0,t1_cpb7kpv,Its just like a drug addict they try to recreate feeling. This is the wrong outlook. You Should just enjoy doing and not the end feelings of an accomplished feet. This is a major problem in child development. Parents praise the A and forget to acknowledge the effort. I will take a child the tried very hard and gets B over a child that does nothing for his A. The easy child will be of no use in the real world they end up lonely and depressed with no understanding of why the world stopped spoon giving them what they wanted. They dont even know how to try and that frustrates them more. And yeah we all have issues I cant stop playing FFXI Ive tried. Its been over Ten years now. I just learn to let myself play and not try and force myself from it. This prevents me from overindulging when I am needed in the real world.,RedditLinkshell,cpbz7q4,1,t5_30out
4033147,0,t1_crcnrqy,They did adjust the event yesterday so it is easier to clear. The increase per person is less and the cap is lower so even spammers can clear it. Also the number of people doing it has fallen since its easier to clear.,RedditLinkshell,crg0cwk,1,t5_30out
