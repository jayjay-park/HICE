Victoria Australia has some of the most restrictive regulations amongst the Australian states and illegal brothels and unregistered independents are far more common than legal establishments. It is too hard to get a license and planning permission and registration of individual independent sex workers is too intimidating for many to consider.Nevada counties have some awfully draconian laws in place for their legal sex workers. Some counties do not allow sex workers to drive a car confining them to their ranch. Others require a chaperone should they venture off the ranch. Ridiculous petty shit.

Lots of escorts get asked to dinner or for freebees and can be wary or someone trying to see them off the clock. But even escorts need and deserve love and can have feelings. But who cares about other providers! Its your girls feelings that matter. You know you need to talk to her. Before you do tho think about what you want and what you would be willing to compromise on. Would you still see her as a client if she turns you down for a date for any reason? Would you be ok if she kept working?  Would you be willing to enter into a sugar baby relationship where you still provide for her but its more of a girlfriend type thing? Be honest to yourself with your answers. If any of these things are deal breakers you might be better off not asking or at least be prepared to potentially end the relationship. Then make a long appointment or overnight. Buy her a present and take her out to dinner on the clock then ask her if she wants to see you as more than a client because you see her as more than an escort. Tell her what you like about her. Show her youre noticing more than her body and BJ skills. And if for any reason she turns you down or hesitates to say yes she might want to see you as a client for a while more first to show her that youre not in it for the free sex handle it like  a gentleman.

I think the best thing might be to  probably stay liquid and find any trusted escort friends that have had the same problem specifically to the UK as the laws are quite different to US and ask them what they did. Its possible someone who is a UK escort may see this post and pm you to provide help as I would personally not recommend many post the specifics of how they do it on a public forum besides keeping it vague. This is going to sound silly but it must be the same method for being a lap dancer or a taxi driver right?  Either way youre still acting  as a self employed independent  contractor. I am looking at similar issues but in regards to something totally boring and banal in  ebusinesses too. Best bet  go the self employed route pay all the taxes you need to pay on your declared income.  Then for more complex stuff wait until you learn about the right people who are in similar industries to help you with regards to which tax accountant to employ etc. Sorry I couldnt be of more help  I just think first and foremost you should not be worrying about how to lower your tax owed and rather how to prevent yourself from falling afoul of the hmrc bloodthirsty bastards. ,SexWorkers,d1tidnw,2,t5_2skjk

He wants to say that clients look at reviews to book? Fine. I dont see how it reviews could be harmful. I know escorts who have had negative reviews held over their heads in exchange for more services. And had to console another one where the review was a blatant lie for no good reason and she couldnt do anything about it. He doesnt get it from an escorts perspective.

10638600,0,t3_5s2gg6,One of the hardest things to deal with is being outed.  In all my years I have discovered the way people get outed most frequently is through their own actions.  Clients dont out you agencies dont out you STALKERS dont even out you YOUR actions out you.If you feel you need to keep this part of your life secret then it needs to be secret from everyone.  Number one way you get outed is by your supposed friends and family exactly like this OP.  Dont share this info with them not your best friend not your sister no one.  Second most common way?  You leave information available to others...an open laptop with your work email exposed texts or other phone communication on an unlocked phone or using a phone for work that others control and can access info through the carrier Mom or hubby pays for it.  I tell everyone.  When I was dating the first line on my profile was I am a sex worker.  It takes courage to do this and not everyone has the same environment I do the basically liberal Bay Area so I dont assume this is the right choice for everyone but it is a viable choice.  The freedom of knowing those around you see who you are fully and love you anyway is powerful.  My kid knows my friends from high school know I am out on my facebook feed.  No one can blackmail me no one has anything on me.  And it isnt illegal to be a sex worker not all sex work is illegal and sex work is a crime that must be found in flagrante delicto you cannot be charged with anything unless you are caught in the act or promoting but that is a different thread.We all need support and if you need to keep this secret then find your support within the community of sex workers.  Dont trust anyone outside that community.  It feels awful to say this but someone you trust will betray you...over jealousy of your income or pettiness over your freedom or even just the regular stuff like you both like the same guy.  Not everyone will betray you but the only way to find out who would is to risk being outed.  If being outed with endanger you cause a level of upheaval that you cannot tolerate then you must not share this info with anyone except other workers.Good luck to us all!,SexWorkers,dddagb6,6,t5_2skjk
10653526,0,t3_5sfnov,So apartment incalls are tricky. I recommend rotating through hotels rather than getting an incall unless youre a specific type of provider and you screen heavily. The fact that you wont be living there full time is good. However having a set rentutilities can make it feel like you have to work even when you dont want to because you need to pay your bills make up the rent. You can save money with an apartment vs a hotel but you have to invest a lot into furnishing the place and utilities and so on.For my escort clients I give them a list of SW friendly hotels in their area and once they have a steady regular incall clientele and are ready to work full time I help them find a good apartment but they usually move into it they dont have two places. let me know if you need help with hotels you can pm me.,SexWorkers,ddetv2m,2,t5_2skjk

11086633,0,t1_deoieyb,gt your example is extreme.I didnt mean it as a real example just trying to make the math more obvious.Prices are set by supply and demand.  How many more women are willing to work as prostitutes if its decriminalized versus how many will do it if there is a small chance of a humiliating arrest and a fine?  Not many more I would guess but some.gt I am ok with us disagreeing We dont actually disagree we both think that prostitution should be decriminalized for all the reasons you list and more.  We have a minor disagreement on who will get all of the benefits.gt but I do think that people who think like you are less likely to support decrimAnd Im cognizant of that but I think we should be honest about the outcomes of it.Here is a thought experiment if everyone believed that decriminalization would lower the price for prostitution would that decriminalization more or less likely?  Would the prostitutes who would support decriminalization less fervently be outweighed by bargainhunting johns?Some outcomes of decriminalization would be unambiguously good . Fewer people going to jail andor more room in jail for real criminals. Lower costs to the taxpayer for putting people in jail andor lower crime rates. Safer working environment for prostitutes and their customers.I am going to ignore the downsides for people like correctionofficers real criminals and psychopaths who like beating up hookers with impunity.Some outcomes of decriminalization are more ambiguous . without the risk of arrest many more customers will enter the marketplace driving up the price level. without the risk of arrest many more prostitutes will enter the marketplace driving driving down the price level and improving the variety and quality of service. many more acts of prostitution will occurI personally am in favor of all those things but other people might disagree.And you probably notice the first two are somewhat contradictory decriminalization drives the price both up and down?  Well yes.  Nobody knows what the net effect would be.   My guess is down a little but I would hate to have to defend that.Incidentally Nordicmodel criminalization where only the customer is arrested has the effect of driving the price down more people are willing to be prostitutes but fewer people are willing to patronize them.,SexWorkers,deonrse,2,t5_2skjk

11615306,0,t1_dg70k6g,gtThis is a great comment. I meant to make the observation that relationships and marriages can be extraordinarily similar to sex work more so than assert my situation is more difficult than sex work but I see now how my post could come off that way.gtSeeking Arrangements sounds like an interesting option.  Ive never heard of it before.gtI was a stripper in the mid s.  Dont have the physique for it anymore but I remember those as good times.  Stripping I acknowledge however does not require anything close to the commitment that Escorting requires.  Still those were fun days.  If I still had the physique Id go back to it.    Dont underestimate your physique! I was at a small strip club last Fall and there was a woman dancing  if you can even call it that with a flabby MILF body. She was obviously not pulling the best shifts. But she was up there on stage! And I loved seeing someone up there with a real body! Perhaps it paid her rent! If you are familiar with stripping.....it is a form of sex work and makes me less uneasy about encouraging you to do some form of sex work. Escorting does not have to be the full time that many of us do. With your educational back ground you could find a couple sugar daddies to provide for you. At one point I only saw a couple regulars around my waitressing bartending schedule but it sure did help me meet my needs! ,SexWorkers,dgclsm7,1,t5_2skjk
11727774,0,t1_dgpd4zr,Oh Im sorry you must have been their when this totally not strawman argument of yours occurred. Ive never once in my life had a discussion about whether or not I was going to use a condom. This is over the course of hundreds of sexual interactions and Ive yet to have one conversation about it. It either happened or it didnt no one discussed it. So no a condom is not a condition of consent it was more than likely implied that one would be used but good fucking luck convincing a judge that it was a condition of consent. Consent can be revoked at anytime but it cant be revoked after the fact. Youre never going to be able to word this in a way to be able to call it rape its just not going to happen. Please argue with the laws and logic and not about how you feel it should work. Like I said you might be able to class it as sexual assault but no in no world is it rape. ,SexWorkers,dgpdgoq,-1,t5_2skjk
