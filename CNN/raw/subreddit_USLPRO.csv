7650133,0,t1_d3bjuxz,but in USL what is the benefit of being promoted or the disadvantage of being relegated? National exposure through streamed games if you are promoted? Most PDL teams stream their games so thats not a huge deal. Would the league allocate you some funds to pick up players or pay your current ones more if youre promoted? do you loss that if you are relegated?If you are in USL  do you keep your automatic birth in the USOC and loss it if youre in USL ?Im not against prorel but im starting to question what is the point? so  teams is too big but  in USL  and  in USL  is alright. That makes no sense. most PDL teams cant be promoted because its primary college kids on those teams. ProRel between USL  and USL  if this were to happen would be a waste Even USL to NASL wouldnt be that big of a jump. If USL really wanted to they could go  east west and only the top  teams from each conference play in a group based final where the teams dont meet the other conference until the final.MLS will never allow a ProRel system Though......i just thought of something.

Well American style nicknames also exist in the UK ever heard of Bolton Wanderers Blackburn Rovers MK Dons.  In the Irish league they have several teams with American style nicknames.  And in Italy they use the word Calcio often.  I guess they are the exception cause they dont use FC for every team.  Or the JLeague Chinese Super League and Aleague are out of line because they dont call every team plain FC.Look i was not saying not to use FC.  But not every team has to be called Input Location FC.  Just cause the EPL does things one way we dont have to do it that way.  Other countries have their own naming conventions as well.

If I had to guess I would bet he is a different look at forward but he is still developing as a pro so there is still a chance he starts breaking out. The Sounders first team gave him a chance but unfortunately he injured himself before he could see minutes. I dont see him as a sniper goal scorer but he can body up with defenders on the run and work the hell out of the outside backs. He will score given the right chances especially from inside the box IMO. Ill bet he is a valuable addition and a good tactical piece for the coaching staff. ,USLPRO,dc3p4y0,2,t5_2vnhz

I did look for whether they had played together before posting last night but completely missed the one year at Reading United together because it isnt called out as clearly on Dacres Wikipedia page. So I will agree that you are most likely correct.It is possible to make it look like you are doing one thing and be saying something else entirely. Obviously nobody could hear what he was saying and again I now assume you are right that he was trying to calm him down. After seeing Dacres off he walked backwards most of the way back to his team kind of goading on the Bailey not shown on any streams that I saw.
