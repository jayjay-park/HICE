3680669,0,t1_cqbt613,I suggest the upper house to be an Australian wide electorate of  senators and lower house on a population by state basis with  seats. Lower house should be odd numbered because government is determined by a majority in lower house and even such as  leaves the potential for a  split meaning a speaker that is elected by the government will basically surrender control to the other partycoalition,modelparliament,cqbtjfy,3,t5_37tbm

4720057,0,t1_ctp9v3l,This is interesting. I wonder if it can be simplified further. It is definitely optional thoughState parliament. Currently all Senators are elected by the single state of the Commonwealth of Australia. Therefore I interpret that the parliament of the state is the federal parliament and the governor of the state is the GovernorGeneral.Party choice. The Constitution already says the new senator will come from the party.Independent senators. I would interpret that the parliament can vote to hold an election to fill the independents vacancy if they so choose.In other words I think the existing Constitution already has the bases covered and by leaving it unaltered we ensure that the States rights are retained for when we do eventually have states.Potential High Court judges may wish to offer their own interpretations.On the other hand the existing Constitution leaves a lot of flexibility with the parliament as an autonomous body whereas perhaps it should be locked down so they have no politicised discretion? In other words to prevent them from filling an independents seat with a nepotistic party appointment?,modelparliament,ctpi3cd,1,t5_37tbm

5703657,0,t3_3t7wro,Jack Bloggs Citizens PressThank you Minister. Ever since fun initiated high speed raili for model parliament it has been clear that the concept enjoys crosspartisan support. After three months of waiting it has finally become part of a budget.However the bill goes against the spirit of federation by focussing expressly on the east coast of Australia s b s  to the exclusion of other states. The vision of this bill is not HSR for Australia but HSR for New South Wales. NSW would benefit from the lions share of federal construction investment and operational benefits since it would most the bulk of lines stations and connections compared to few or none in other states. Obviously this is motivated by population and geography but if the HSR Authority is to have unbiased and fair power to advise on plan and develop the HSR system why have you excluded half the mainland states and territories? What ever happened to holistic planning?Yet again Western Australia loses out. Not only do other states already benefit immensely from WAs contribution to the GST now WA is again being overlooked for major Commonwealth investment and jobs. The Premiers of WA and South Australia have called upon the government to properly consider HSR in all its forms across Australia including the potential creation of local jobs for mining and manufacturing of lines rolling stock ticketing systems etc by Australians in Australia. The CFMU has released a statement decrying the lack of attention on HSR jobs for WA SA and northern Australia and called for a shared vision for HSR whereever it might be built and operated.Will the Coalition table an unbiased bill from the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development or will it be up to regional MPs to amend it?,modelparliament,cx43emw,3,t5_37tbm

If there is enough support though well I will not stand in the way.  gt...  gtTo those that are unsure how to begin writing legislation...the Office of Parliamentary Counsel is there for exactly this purpose. Our standard is that bills must be plausible enough to convince other MPs and Senators to vote for them. So simpleton bills usually wont pass the smell test especially among players who put a lot of effort into their own bills. A simpleton bill might pass the Parliament but then get struck down by the High Court due to deficiencies. So it is a dynamic thing. I think there is no specific standard required other than to be plausible. MPs seem to be doing okay without the OPC as none of them have even asked for anything.gtMy opinion is that we should keep the formality of legislations but rewrite a new Standing Orders that simplifies things significantly. That should allow things to move much faster...Also we need to definitely simplify how members of parliament can actually do stuff in parliament.Things can happen fast now the fact is that not all players want it to go fast and the main slowdown is due to nonparticipation players who dont turn up to debate or vote. The Senate passes bills in less than an hourefar when it wants to.gt And finally I think the Senate must not disappear. With the new Senators and the removal of some inactive Senators I think the Senate can return back to a House of Review and rightfully so.The Senate hasnt functioned as a house of review in months. It is just meaningless doublehandling which sucks up our volunteer time and delays bills unproductively.,modelparliament,cydd5xi,1,t5_37tbm
