8614287,0,t3_4xswsk,I do like the indication of what sort of action generated which result in the log.  Having the action buttons in the crafting area works too as it makes the available resources more visible.My personal issue with the game is getting lost after starting to get followers and books and arcane things  my process of discovering actions seems to stall out around that point.  I made decent initial progress by literally trying every singleverbanditem combination and documenting the results but things that may require multiple items or containers dont work well with the bruteforce approach.  Probably by design and perhaps my brain just lacks the necessary flexibility to make a good cultist!It also took me a little while to realize that the listing of qualities when assembling a verb and item were all the qualities that provided like Lantern from Sanity.  For a while I thought I was performing a reduced version of the actions as I didnt literally have Lantern in my inventory to also add via a container etc.  Maybe some differentiation between the items and provided qualities might be useful?  I could also see a version of the interface that lets you select the desired quality first and then a matching item but that may be more overt than desired.Anyway interesting game!  Just wanted to add some feedback thanks for sharing it with us.,weatherfactory,d6idtca,1,t5_3fmuc
