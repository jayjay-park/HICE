1835620,0,t1_ck9v5qt,My current landlord moved in about four months ago tried to tell me that I would have to pay monthly rent in cash.  I told him to get bent as there is no way in hell Im biking across town to my bank every month and then back across town with  cash on me just to make him happy.

2023595,0,t1_ckwwn3i,Thats exactly what I said less than previous generations.gt If you just Google Millennials and car ownership or Millennials and driving youll see a TON of articles about how Millennials are simply not interested in driving as the previous generation was for more reasons than just economics.,lowcar,ckx1ioa,0,t5_2s5gk

3576492,0,t3_31a8q2,Yeah the idea of a war is silly. This isnt some kind of zero sum game since people can actually choose their mode of transportation for different trips.While there will have to be some compromises I want better cycling infrastructure because I think it will be on average better for every one.,lowcar,cpzy4fv,5,t5_2s5gk

4199555,0,t1_crya8nx,gt The sentence preceding the one you quoted isnt about the US thoughIt sort of seems to be the lynchpin of the argument though. If you can only make the argument apply to a small fraction of carusers from a lowpopulation region of a single continent...It becomes meaninglessly academic. You arnt talking about policies that have the power to shape world carbon output anyway. Also this is about finance. How we pay for things amp subsidize things. That has nothing to do with total emissions. ,lowcar,cryxz90,1,t5_2s5gk
4690679,0,t3_3essaa,Hopefully in the not too distant future there wont be a traffic jam to leap over because society will have moved on from automobile dependence especially in New York City! and streets will be safe for all modes of transportation.The idea is reminiscent of ideas like elevated walkways. Well intentioned but end up just encouraging more driving killing street life and sending the message that other modes of transportation have to get out of the way to make room for cars.,lowcar,ctlswnt,2,t5_2s5gk
5157156,0,t1_cv78j8i,Do you mean how does the recumbent trike compare with a twowheeled recumbent? If so others might have more practical experience as my trike is the only recumbent Ive ever ridden.I can say however that there are definite benefits and drawbacks to three wheels vs. two. Trike ProsStabilitycrashing would take conscious effort.Never unclipstopsigns are a nonissue since you dont have to unclip to put a foot down. No minimum speedMy top gear is  warp drive but my bottom is  stump puller. I can trundle up a hill at  miles per hour and never get wobbly.Trike ConsWeightmine weighs lbs with nothing on it and thats a light trike.Highspeed corneringsince the trike cant lean into curves it cant corner near as fast as a wheel.  This also puts a lot of lateral stress on the big rear wheel in particular which is not something bike wheels are designed for. I have to tighten my spokes pretty regularly.Ride qualitythe tiny front wheels mean it rides like a skateboard and having three wheels evenly spaced across  feet means dodging potholes is basically impossible unless you plan ahead.My trike is absolutely fantastic for city riding since its got a rearview mirror you dont have to unclip at stops and its a speed demon. However I do a lot of my riding in the hills on rough roads and for that Id lean toward a wheel recumbent or a less speedoriented more durabilityoriented trike.Additionally Im strongly considering read fantasizing about converting my trike into a velomobile. Better aerodynamics and weatherresistance are just too tantalizing.,lowcar,cv7moii,6,t5_2s5gk
