6666117,0,t1_d08qdxt,Yeah thats what Ive been told thanks P Youre right one of the programs says they have the ability to assess that for themselves I havent actually asked them about it. But the people at one elite college on the East Coast have told me this    gt Speaking of the language requirement we expect students to have had  years of collegelevel study in a regional language usually Russian or nativelevel fluency when they apply. We would want to know how many years you studied it at Evergreen State. If you didnt have the full  years we would want to see some evidence of how good your Russian is either through classes taken in a summer program or through private lessons. I would strongly suggest that you consider how you would adequately demonstrate Russian preparation in your application either with additional transcripts recommendations from a tutor or both.So in order to satisfy this requirement one of my letters of recommendation was from a woman who happens to be a professor of nuclear physics at MGU which doesnt hurt I tutored English to who attested that my level in Russian is roughly upperintermediate. But other than that Ive got nothing. For a FLAS scholarship I had my current tutor write off on a form that my level was intermediate but I never asked her for a letter of recommendation because she isnt really an academic professional or because our lessons are rather informal. But the reason Im considering this mostly is because this school was supposed to get in touch with me last week and I didnt hear a peep out of them. So I think Ive been passively turned down for this MA program. Fortunately I may be getting ahead of myself and in the event that they are giving me a no I have  more  university programsscholarships Im waiting to hear back from so I should be more patient PThanks for your response.,russian,d08u1mw,1,t5_2qlc6

6917584,0,t3_4af1ln,I have a very special reason. Its a long story but here goes...I want to be friends with and possibly much more with a Russian girl. Now for me this isnt just any kind of girl. Ive met alot of girls in my  years on Earth but never have I come across on such an interesting funloving clever funny and super cool not to mention pretty girl like her. She is from Novosibirsk which is far far away from where I live Hungary. I started conversations with her from  december and all through  we had good email exchanges. She was genuinely interested in what I had to say about myself. She wasnt just answering with aha yeah I see but wrote well enough to me about what she was doing where did she go. She loves to travel and tries out all kinds of sport activities like snowboarding climbing riding a bike swimming... She travels to a foreign country every year and the more I read from her and saw of her the more I had a crush on her. Imagine how awesome it would be to go on adventures like that. Not a boring girl thats for sure in my opinionSo because she can only speak a bit of English I decided to learn Russian. I went to a language learning course in my city which lasted about  months before I lost my motivation. I just kept using google translate when writing to her thinking it will be servicable. It wasnt.Anyways for the first year I think it was awesome to get videoemail messages from her. I even bought her a plushiespecifically an animal that she wanted to get and some other gifts which Ive sent to her in the summer and on her birthday. She Then in  something must have happened or I did something bad because she stopped. I have an idea why but it doesnt matter now. I went to a Russian private teacher in January of  to start more seriously. I made better progress I even started going to the gym found a much better job etc. Ive made alot of sacrifices to get more money to continue to keep up the learning and contact. I wanted to show her how much Ive improved and that Im seriously thinking about meeting her...because I dont want anything else in the world and Im not an evil guy who does shady things.I wrote perfect letters with the help of my teacher. But no answers came. I didnt know what to do how to continue. I am still very much a beginner when it comes to Russian mainly because Ive studied only here and there never constantly everyday.  days ago with the help of an other person I could call her on phone. Sadly it was a horrible experience. The signal was weak voice was too low I couldnt understand almost anything. Everytime I finished question to her there was a pause a silence as if my voice takes a little time to get there. The phone call ended abruptly. I felt sick for  days couldnt eat anything and was very nervous.Some of my friends told me to let it go forever that there is no way it will ever work and Im wasting my time and money.But I didnt want to believe them. Now? I cannot turn back time. If I could I would do everything completely differently ask the right questions at the right time. You know like in the movie Groundhog Day when the day resets itself for the protagonist. I need to push on and correct my mistakes.I have a plan. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes. The failure just made me much more motivated than ever before. I thought to myself This is it? This is your limit to what you can do? If you stop now youre as good as dead and you will constantly curse yourself for not taking the chance when you were still young!Ive never been so motivated about anything in my life before. I made a deadline for myself. In  months I should be able to finish my language learning book with my teacher and get to a level where I could talk about stuff. That means in August I will contact one of the closest friend of my crush and tell her everything about my story. Im certain she can help me. They all look different than the girls here in my country. So sympathetic and interesting. I believe it will work. I NEED to see her with my own eyes and meet her. Tell her Im sorry if I offended her and that I would give up anything and everything if I could make friends with her and her friendsI even stopped playing my games. Yesterday I sat down to play and to get my mind off this thing and just thought no...wtf am I doing this is a waste of precious time and I turned it all off just like that. Learning this language has become the top priority for me and anything else to help speed it up.  And seriously I might be a fool I might be crazy but I wont stop until I meet her. Theres nothing wrong wanting to have friends like that right. Thats why we make contact. Just dont want to be alone for all of our life.Not just sitting on my ass in my room for eternity but actually doing stuff. I can beat this challenge. Russian isnt going to learn itself. I say it aint over until its over.This was a dramatic response but in short all because of one girl. So what do you think?,russian,d10fjc5,7,t5_2qlc6

However any issues I had I used They are the best fastest and cheapest. I eventually transitioned to working for a Russian company but they sorted me out quickly and easily. If you have experience in the petroleum industry run with that and start applying through linkedin or hh.ru With your experience you should be able to find some work here. The only issue for you is going to be finding a salary which is comparable to the one you have already as the ruble is pretty depressed right now. I only mention teaching as its a good way to fund your living expenses if you only plan to stay here for a few months and dont want to find an official employer to provide you with a work permit. Its not that the permit is hard to get you just have to find an employer to hire you. If you have professional experience that shouldnt be that hard.My friend works for an oligarch and a few other rich families. They pay well.

Taking them one at a time is essential.Also if you find yourself thinking of cases as a nuisance and a general pain in the ass thing that you have to get right in order to have good grammar remember that cases are tools.

Couple of caveats if you do this Dont do language exchanges with people who arent trained to teach Russian. Its a total waste of time and youll probably get language raped.  Language raped is when a woman or man wants to be your friend to practice their English not because theres any other reason to be your friend Do pay for private lessons with a qualified teacher Dont spend your time hanging out with expats.  Its easy and its comforting but its a great way to not learn how to speak Russian.   Get a Russian girlfriend or boyfriend.  Find groups of people who have the same hobbies you do in Moscow and go to their meetups.

Newspeak literary destroys meanings of common words Soviet  does not. Calling them identical is a huge overestimation. Its like calling race car and its plastic toy copy identical  sure they look alike but components they are made of and that is important their purpose are completely different. Naming your ministry  your son  and your officer  cant strain the flight of your thought. Im not going to argue that USSR hasnt run some sort of state propaganda. It did. However state propaganda which lies to countrys citizens can be found in practically any country. With your logic all countries can be accused of indoctrination of their citizens into supporting state ideology and state politics. Orwells words can be applied to any state and any regime.  Saying that only communist state brainwashes people because its communist is like accusing all Jews of being greedy because there is a stereotype about them having this feature. If the Soviets wanted to brainwash people they wouldnt have to educate them. In s only  of citizens could read or write. After the Civil war ended bolsheviks started a huge educational campaign which eventually ended in one the highest levels of literacy in the world. If they wanted to control thoughts of their citizens they would just keep them illiterate because uneducated people are a lot easier to manipulate. Any way if Communist party has been Ingsoc there would not be so much dissidents. There would be no dissolution of USSR  nobody would even think of rebellion.  ,russian,d5zl8rn,1,t5_2qlc6

The focus subject of this sentence is bag so  is an adjective and it changes form depending on what is needed.

As a rule of thumb use genitive in contexts where in English you would say someany milk someany flour and accusative where in English you would use the nouns with a definite or zero article. For instance suppose that you have already poured the milk into a mug put in on the table and both you and your interlocutor are aware of it being there to be more exact aware that each of you is aware. Then in English you might say Do you want the milk? and in Russian  ?  meaning this particular mug of milk. On the other hand if you mean to ask whether your interlocutor wants an unspecific amount of milk which is not in sight or which is in a larger container so that only part of it has to be put in a separate vessel for drinking then in English youd rather say Do you want some milk and in Russian use genitive  ?.Also note that some nd declension nouns have a special partitive case form which is used instead of genitive or along with it depending on the word in such indefinite contexts.

This week Im on the next chapter dealing with pluralsspelling rules for Nominative only so far which so far is easier but the new information is a lot to memorize. So sorry for not being more specific I was talking about both endings and stress. So to be more specific now my question is what is a good way to drill all this new information and more upcoming into my head ? Since the new stuff piles on quick. To add more information Im selflearning and no native speakers in person to assist which makes it a tad harder.Though for stress is it a word by word basis or is there general rules regarding the type of word sorry if not making sense since right now Im taking stress on a word by word basis. Not sure if this is such a good idea. From what I gather from your comment there appears to be patterns among different groups of words? When it comes to stress the only rule I know is that  is always stressed in a word of if Im wrong then like . of the time. Again apologize for rambling.
