720958,0,t3_22ext3,As a provision of his Contract With America in  Newt Gingrich sought to limit the terms of congressional members including himself. Term limits was the only provision of the Contract that did not pass proving that career parasites will not vote themselves off the gravy train. Something that necessary and otherwise impossible is just one reason we need a Convention of States.I forgot about this. Theyve also rejected a balanced budget amend in the past. They will never take the steps for real reform. The system is broken.  Its clear they are out of control and the only fix is A Convention of States. ,ConventionOfStates,cgm85jl,2,t5_2yeg4

4583035,0,t3_3dl761,The Liberty Amendments by Mark Levin is a good place to start for good possible amendments. The Convention of States project calls for any amendments in three areas term limits for federal officials restricting the scope and jurisdiction of the federal government and imposing fiscal restraint on the federal government. The actual Convention would propose debate and recommend the amendments to be submitted for ratification to the States.,ConventionOfStates,ct8akq2,2,t5_2yeg4
