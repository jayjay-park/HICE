562844,0,t1_cg48vb1,It really depends on the professor making the exams. The average on the tests was around  when I took it. Obviously they cant fail most of the students in such a low level course that a lot of people need for their majors so there has to be a curve. Talk to your classmates and try to get an idea of what the average person got. Email your professor and ask himher what the actual average was. If youre still worried after that then go to office hours every chance you get and work out homework problems and ask the professor for some example problems to work on after youve finished those. You should be able to get a good idea of what might be asked on a test by which problems you are given to practice on.That being said  dont let it ruin your grade. Physics is really tough here so I know more than a few people who elected to take it somewhere else and transfer in the credit. Talk to your adviser about that,BinghamtonUniversity,cg491zf,3,t5_2ryg7
562884,0,t1_cg491zf,Thanks so much for the information. The professor told us the average was a  before giving back the exams. So as you said surely they cant fail that many people? My classmates were all over two kids got a perfect score while plenty did as poorly as me. And I would take it elsewhere but Ive sadly already got a lot of money sunk into it.  Thank you again though.,BinghamtonUniversity,cg497v4,1,t5_2ryg7

2096768,0,t3_2iwnu8,For two years I lived north of Main Street within a few blocks of Crandall Street and I never had any problems. It never seemed much different than the majority of the other places in the general west side area. Of course occasionally youll have odd neighbors and what not but generally the people around were pretty nice. Nothing that ever negatively effected my life in any way at least. I dont know if that has changed over the  years since but I dont think there is anything wrong with living north of Main Street. Plenty of sketchy things happen south of Main too. ,BinghamtonUniversity,cl6cgec,3,t5_2ryg7

3646567,0,t1_cq7vv7b,This is a great comment. I come from a very small town population  and Binghamton is like a metropolis for me. I can understand why it is boring for long islanders and NYC kids since as you said they pretty much live in the capital of the world. But they can often come across like they are looking down on Binghamton. One of my biggest gripes with the school is how much the students mock the townies.If youre from that area I would definitely take this into consideration when selecting a school. Binghamton probably wont be super exciting for you and if the people Ive met are any indication youll become bitter judgmental and elitist. It may not be worth putting yourself through this.,BinghamtonUniversity,cq7xpcv,9,t5_2ryg7

Not once have I actually performed an integral on a test.From what Ive heard about  however you need to be familiar with advanced integrals and possibly series. Definitely ask someone familiar with the course what the specific skills are so that you can read up on them ahead of time.,BinghamtonUniversity,cqfhe8q,1,t5_2ryg7

8086979,0,t3_4phitc,I just graduated from Bing with a doublemajor one in STEM and one in philosophy so let me help you out man! and any other student who clicked on this wanting to learn about the phil major! Just to give you a fair warning though  I took a drop in my GPA to double in phil because it was worth it to me. I graduated with a mid B GPA having a solid low B in Phil but again definitely worth it. Im probably giving away my identity with this info oh well.The classes are really rigorous which I thought I was used to but I think what makes getting a good grade so difficult are the other students. In my science classes a lot of students are just looking to pass and the curves are really generous if youre intelligent and put in the extra work to stay above the curve. In philosophy classes especially upperlevels the students are really smart with no curves. I know this is arrogant but when I first took a philosophy class I thought that I was intelligent and this would be an easy class. My confidence took a huge hit. Ive literally never met such smart kids in my life who write papers and talk about things in discussions that I cant even understand. Like I couldnt even understand the material let alone write papers and take exams on it. A lot of classes covered topics I would just zone out at times because I would be so confused...coming from having taken Orgo  and  with a B and a B. I really considered dropping the major when I realized how hard it was but it was soo worth it! Made a huge difference on my life and med school path in a lot of ways. Professors amp Personal Growth. Ive taken classes in a lot of departments chem bio physics math psych... and the phil professors may be the best in all of Binghamton. Night and day with professors Ive taken as a premed student. I know this sounds clich but some professors and classes Ive taken have completely literally changed my outlook on life how I act and my beliefs....like these classes have changed me. I genuinely feel like Ive ridden myself of so much ignorance and I am...I dont know how to put this humbly but more of an intellectual. No other classes in other departments have done that. Its like in other classes I memorized information and formulas to do problems but in philosophy classes I actually had to think...and very hard at that. Sure my GPA took a hit but what Ive gotten out of these classes is worth every point tenfold. These professors are actual geniuses Im not throwing around the word loosely and the effect they and the classes have had on me has completely transformed me.. Students I am no where near being the top student in any of my phil classes. I tend to get straight BsBs and never got an A in a class lol. Ive met and had my mind fucked by having dinner and befriending some kids. Yeah you do have one or two insanely pretentious kids in the major but a lot of these kids are just the nicest and smartest kids Ive met at Bing. Im a pretty social guy I have a lot of different friends and a lot of people dont know this about me but secretly Id just prefer to have dinner with another phil kid and talk about life rather than going out. I love having a really smart friend group from the major.. PostBing Life amp Exams STEM employers love phil majors Ive gotten several jobs and a research position over the summer using that as a hook. As the kid before me said people assume that youre smart with a philosophy degree. It really is true and employers always treat me differently once I tell them especially when theyre oversaturated with kids with just STEM degrees. It brings new perspective knowledge and really just different people. A lot of my STEM friends were always surprised when I told them I doubled in phil but I wish more kids knew this. Honestly a lot of STEM kids at Bing are ignorant when it comes to it but its their loss. Also philosophy majors have the highest LSAT scores and composite GRE scores of ANY major and score higher on the MCAT They have a higher rate of acceptance to med schools...which hopefully will help me out!I really would advise you to major in philosophy. It can only help you in anything you do which is something that cant be said about...well anything else really. Ill really miss Binghamton and Im just so happy to have graduated. Yeah I made some mistakes at Bing with classes I should have studied harder for including phil classes but really looking back I am so happy with the decision I made to add it on. Probably the best decision I ever made. If any other current students are reading this regardless of majorpath take a philosophy class before you graduate. It will definitely change you and you can take it PF if you dont want to hurt your GPA. It really makes me kind of sad even when I see a lot of my friends who were just obsessed with getting a job after graduation that did not take advantage of college. College isnt about a job. College is about gaining knowledge...practical for jobs but also other types of knowledge to change you as a person. Yes Ill get really controversial here but towards the end of my senior year I started to see how different students were who had these two attitudes about what the purpose of college was. I know a lot a lot of kids set on a job throughout college that now have or dont have that said job. And now what? Theyre at their jobs starting a career for the rest of their life having taken nothing out of college other than the practical knowledge needed for that one career. Its honestly like being trapped in a small bubble of knowledge. I certainly dont want to generalize so Ill stick to my friend group. As time went on I lost a lot of friends because well I started to realize that they were actually really ignorant and closedminded. It was scary because I realized I used to be like them to say the same things and treat life and others the same way too. But it showed me how I had changed. I think its so important to take classes not just for the sake of taking a gened which is a mentality that a lot of kids have but honestly to learn something  to make yourself a better openminded and wellrounded person. I wish so badly that I saw this earlier in college and graduating now its so crystal clear to me what college was all about. Its about  gaining practical knowledge for your future career path shedding yourself of ignorances and becoming more of an intellectual a wellrounded adult who is intelligent and wellspoken. No matter who you are its honestly backstabbing yourself to not gain perspective in college through liberal arts. Harpur is huge you have no excuse!So Ill end this post got a bit emotional but hey I reserve that right as a senior who just graduated. Please take advantage of Binghamton if youre still there and heed the advise of a graduate who has seen and made a lot of mistakes!tldr no matter what major you are take a philosophy class and try and generally take as many liberal arts classes as you can. it will change you for the better which is a tool of college a lot of students dont take advantage of. ,BinghamtonUniversity,d4p1taz,2,t5_2ryg7
8383492,0,t3_4uemzh,Hi there! As someone with severe anxiety diagnosed with GAD! who also started off in Watson for almost  years I am no longer in Watson because of realizing it is not the field for me. It has certainly tested my anxiety but any schoolwork will. You have to decide if it is worth it which by most peoples standards it would be. The outcome of graduating with a Watson Engineering degree is a great one. yes it is difficult. But its doable!Again do you find it to be worth it? use your peers for support and study help but do not rely on them for answers. Not even homework. If you dont understand the homework ask for help. You will not magically understand it by the test. USE THE UNIVERSITY COUNSELING CENTER. this is my greatest regret. I should have been in there the first week of school but it took me THREE YEARS and a lot of pushing from my boyfriend to go. They are so so wonderful. academic advising is also so wonderful. Dont just rely on the convenient planned semesters that Watson plans out for you. Go see advising whenever you feel stuck about something. Everyone here is here to help you. on that note OFFICE HOURS. So essential to doing well and understanding material. I understand that for people with anxiety this can be one of the toughest things. This is my other great regret of college that I allowed my anxiety to talk me out of going. Do not let that happen. dont let anxiety tell you its okay to not go to class. Its not period. Sure maybe your professor really doesnt notice or care. But trust me going to class or NOT makes all the difference. Its really the simple habits that will allow or disallow you to succeed in Watson. Unfortunately its simple habits that can be controlled negatively by anxiety. Dont let it get out of control. You CAN do this. Do it!,BinghamtonUniversity,d5phgox,2,t5_2ryg7
