7955608,0,t3_4o7vy5,gt What is wrong with our understanding of thermodynamics ?Chances are nothing is wrong with it. It could be a megastructure without us detecting an infrared excess. It might be orbiting far from the star so its cold. It could be radiating its waste heat in another direction. It might be giant highly reflective mirrors.,KIC8462852,d4aa9u9,4,t5_3aeb0
8047196,0,t1_d4jxnd8,OK so KICs radius is .  Rsol according to  and its mass is .  Msol. Rsol.   m so L star diameters  L    .  .   m  L     m.If the structure transits the stars disk in approximately  days or  seconds then it means an orbital speed of v    L kms. We dont need to account for perspective here because the distance between the Sun and KIC is millions times greater than distances inside a system. Now we use a formula from  for a circular orbit vsqrtGMr where G.   mseckg M is the stars mass and r is the orbital radius deriving rGMv . Lets doublecheck it for Earth to be sure r  G  MsolvEath  .             m thats really really close to AU indeed as it should be. Ok then for KIC r.    .        L  L AU. This equation seems to give us very good boundaries on objects size!For example habitable zone borders are proportional to square root of luminosity and a KICs luminosity is . x the Suns so an Earths analogue should be at . AU. This means a transiting object L times the main stars diameter long will be on Earthlike orbit an L object would be slightly colder and an object L times the stars diameter will be much colder than Mars.Further we can also calculate an orbital year given the radius for a circular orbit its simply   pi  r  v so L years. For example for L its  years but less than a year for L which is inconsistent with Keplers observations.

8173833,0,t1_d4z8h4t,Its most likely not going to help as both you and uCrimfants mentioned..  I actually agree.. but this star is so weird.. id be willing to take any observation just to rule out anything unexpected...  lets face it. .this whole star is unexpected..  drops  awkward patterns  no IR excess...  Id say observe with everything we have and that we have coming online...  something will show something...  If I wanted to tell the universe that whatever is going on isnt natural.   Id send out a beacon on the other side of that solar panel.    so youll get a dip in natural outgoing frequency by  and then a broadcast signal.   If they use Broadcasting  if its even aliens..   I know.. alot of ifs..  but again its not going to hurt anyone and I am saying now I know the chances of finding anything with a radio telescope is minimal at best...  but who knows?

8397932,0,t1_d5nienw,Evidence to support Dirk Bontes unstable Cephid like via double ionization of helium hypothesis?    A spectrum just before a deep dimming event should show  strong absorption lines of helium.  At the peak of the dimming still see absorption lines not as pronounced and gradually fade.  As star exits the event strong emission lines of helium that peak and then gradually fade to normal.   We should be able to find more stars that exhibit Tabbys dimming behavior in the Kepler data.  There should be about  F series stars to reanalyze.  The probability of detection depends on how long this suggested instability lasts   years?    years?   A million etc.     Perhaps..... Very precise radial velocity measurements of Tabbys beforeduringafter a deep dimming event MAY detect the star swelling during absorption and shrinking back to normal during emission.   ,KIC8462852,d5rady7,1,t5_3aeb0

8561212,0,t1_d6boef4,I agree that any beings at KIC probably wont notice us until  years after we started broadcasting radio into space. My statement was based on the decodability of communications between species regardless of time or origin.I have difficulty imagining an alien species that would be so amazingly advanced that theyd see the voyager space ship and say this is an uninteresting piece of symmetrical metallic perfectly smooth in places space debris lets ignore it.That theyd look at the gold placed on the front and say I notice there is this shiny piece of gold here at the front that is perfectly circular and placed in such a way so as to be eyecatching in most spectrums of electromagnetic radiation. It must be completely coincidental and naturally formed. Lets not investigate this thing any furtherThat theyd look at the scratches and notice the patterns of updown lines drawn in a perfect circle and say Wow. this is completely normal and not unique or special in any way. This is not a puzzle that Id like to solve because every single being in our species have evolved past curiosity after we solved all of the puzzles of the universe which gave us the advanced technology we have today.,KIC8462852,d6bq8st,5,t5_3aeb0

8643728,0,t1_d6lcihg,Ill bite.Some part of me would like it to be aliens but at the end of the day I think it would be bad for humanity and Im rooting for humanity.If you look at history and instances of a primitive society meeting a more advanced one it almost always works out badly for the primitive society. See Guns Germs and SteelMany of the more likely scenarios for advanced cultures have built in conflicts that I think this would not end well for us.This culture is using resources that other cultures would eventually want if societal development follows a predictable paththat resource being stars which are scarce due not to their quantity but due to their proximity.If we conquer death even at a low birth rate exponential population growth eventually outgrows the speed at which we can spread at light speed. Over millions of years you can foresee the conflict for energy from nearby stars ahead of time.We are easy to extinguish now but might be difficult to destroy later. If we have a faster technological growth rate than they do we might represent an existential risk to them. Why would they chance it?If it is an AI instead of a fleshy alien most outcomes are bad for meatware like us. Take the paperclip maximizer as a thought experiment on how things can end badly. The usual reason people think the AI wouldnt harm us involves anthropomorphizing it and giving it mercy curiousity or human values which is  just not how code works. An AI has no compassion or reason not to remove any obstacles to its goals.tldr In any scenario that pits us vs. them and there are many I cant expect that they would choose us.,KIC8462852,d6m2rp9,1,t5_3aeb0

9000600,0,t3_53iyv9,It is worth noting that the new information from GAIA limits a number of megastructurebased scenarios as well. In particular all scenarios that were based on a distance of around pc or over can all be thrown out at this point. In fact there were more megastructure scenarios in this range of distances than natural explanations and so strictly speaking the percentage of viable megastructure scenarios has gone down.Having said that the most compelling natural explanations were not immediately bolstered by GAIA and so the case is still as wide open as ever.I have seen a number of people arguing against certain alignments or other explanations being part of the solution because they would be very rare. To me it is starting to look like a rare occurrence might actually be a feature for a potential solution since we are not seeing stars behaving like this very often.And this brings us to a big problem with a megastructurebased solution. If this is indeed a megastructure then where are all of the other megastructures that we would also expect to see? Is it plausible to only see one at this point? Find us a few dozen more candidates or better yet a few hundred and then we are getting somewhere.,KIC8462852,d7tqdu0,7,t5_3aeb0

9157266,0,t3_55pxrn,gtAstronomers were already running short of good ideas to account for the dips in KIC s brightness and the new results will make that task even harder. Simon and Montet think that the best proposal so far for explaining the stars drastic six month dimming might be a collision or breakup of a planet or comet in the stars system creating a shortterm cloud of dust and debris that blocks some starlight. However this wouldnt explain the longerterm dimming observed during the first three years of Kepler and suggested by measurements of the star dating back to the nineteenth century.Lack of IR rules out comets.
