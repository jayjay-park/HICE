9390927,0,t3_594opk,I have gone through  am in the process of it at the moment. I can say it works great and Ive had considerable success with it. I am very close to the end of the process. Went from a family of hoarders to a  bedroom house chock full of stuff and finally down to a onebedroom condo thats airy easy to clean with a wardrobe I love and very few items out of place. Worth the process a thousand times over. I found that I learned a lot about myself along the way. Even shed a fiance... I learned more about my likes  dislikes aesthetics etc... and once I was finished or am nearing that I have SO MUCH free time! Its crazy how much I used to dedicate to organizing cleaning and just straight up shopping.Id say it would help to have a clear goal in mind as to WHY you want to declutter  get back to basics. Do you just want to make your life easier overall or do you have a long term goal? For me I discovered along the way that where I am in life is not where I want to be and I have a specific set of goals that I am working to attaining. I find a huge help for me was not only to look at each item and think of whether it brought me joy but whether OWNING it would keep me from attaining my goals. It sounds silly when she notes it in her book but I found it to be true. I cleaned up my house and along the way I discovered what I really want in life. ,basicliving,d96d7ob,1,t5_30bod
