186088,0,t1_cezmnwo,I think the greatest concern for those of us concerned with legalization going well is that people who are not particularly familiar with cannabis begin partaking especially things like edibles and then get behind the wheel irresponsibly. If someone eats a brownie for the first and goes for a drive may have a very bad time.  For many of us who are more habitual users we have clearly developed a tolerance that isnt particularly limited in terms of driving ability. but for many new users I think it could potentially be a real concern.In addition obviously figuring out a method to properly measure current intoxication as opposed to blood or hair tests is important. Swabs seem like a fairly reasonable step here.Ultimately though I think you are correct in saying its probably not going to be a very serious problem long term since its unlikely to significantly increase use as many people already drive while high without any real significant presence on accident reports etc.  I think as legalization continues forward and public perception becomes more tolerant people will be less likely to have the need to equate it with drunk driving. Its just not really comparable.,eldertrees,cezmtlr,4,t5_2tclf

For instance yes alcohol may be more of a dangerous drug than marijuana but most people who do choose to drink do so responsibly most or all of the time. I dont feel that the comparisons between weed vs beer are very fair or productive towards the pot movement. If anything that line of thinking leads towards prohibition of all drugs. On the other hand comparisons between what works with alcohol regulation and what should work with marijuana regulation are productive. Alcohol and tobacco abuse has steadily lessened over the years and its because of proactive regulation in no small part due to advertisement laws. You wont see any beer ads during Saturday morning cartoons.

Addiction is influenced greatly my epigenetics and the most well study mechanisms are histone modification mostly histone acetylation and methylation. Genes that have been associated in the literature with such modification include cFos Fosb Bdnf and others. The modified state of various histone lysine residues  such as HK  have been associated with dependencerelated behaviors and physical phenomena e.g. Conditional Place Preference. I also discuss neurological changes in synapse plasticity and whole cell plasticity mostly in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. Its worth noting that many of these mechanisms are similar across various different types of drugs.Here is an interesting paper discussing some of these mechanisms its not behind a pay wall at least not for me. The textbook that I mentioned in my post discusses marijuana more specifically.

Shatter can contain residual solvents if not purged correctly. A butane filled dab would make anyone feel the way you did that night. There are times where I get too high off extracts and feel that way. Low blood sugar usually is a major culprit of nausea after smoking.

All it takes is a few minutes a week twice a week to make you self sufficient. I started with minimal gardening experience pulling weeds and half my dads vegetable garden thinking they where weeds and I did ok with my first grow and just got better as I went along. This is also the most affordable way to medicate. The start up cost is high but it pays for itself after your first harvest compared to buying it. I also feel the risk is low compared to buying it off some guy on the street.

Fixing these errors will give us as consumers and patients a much better understanding of what the plant is capable of producing and how to find the exact effect you are seeking for your specific need.  Referring to them as strains or indicas and sativas is using the wrong terminology and it limits us greatly since the same clone can produce varying cannabinoid profiles or chemotypes.  And as you mentioned how some people have adverse effects to sativa varieties is exactly why we should try to understand what it is in the plant that is causing that effect in those particular people so in the future they know to avoid varieties that have those profiles.,eldertrees,cyqoyah,3,t5_2tclf

6273645,0,t3_41hxni,It sounds like you come from a completely different household than I do but Ill offer up some advice.First off my parents would have beat me senseless if they ever found my stash back in middle schoolhigh school. One of their biggest things was simply that they dont want me doing any of that in their house. This made sense to me because it wasnt my house...So maybe you need to get that across to your brother. The fact this his selling of it and potentially stashing of it at home is putting your whole family in danger. Not just with the police but if he were to make a bogus deal or inform the wrong person of his dealing it puts everyone in that house in danger. Until he becomes a big boy and can afford his own place he shouldnt even think twice about selling out of your families house.And the biggest thing of this all is that you cant tell him what to do. You setting guidelines and rules is just going to make him tell you to fuck off and continue doing it. To get him on the topic of usage I would suggest starting off talking about what he sees for himself after high school. Relate with him through your experiences of high school and how all the respect and popularity you earn in high school really doesnt matter. Take him around the neighborhood and point out the low lifes who were cool and into drugs back in high school. Youve gotta show your brother that drugs dont pay off when thats all you have going for you. That there is so much more in life to experience beyond drugs. You cant tell him what are the right and wrong ways to use pot but you can put him on the path to come to a realization himself.And about your little sister... You can scold him for that. Ask him if he potentially wanted to be the reason your sister is licking knob to score some free pot. If he wanted to be the reason she began selling pot... If your brother has some sense in him he will see.. If not then good luck.,eldertrees,cz2qqul,10,t5_2tclf

Depending on the skill of the grow it could even be less harsh etc. You can get some idea by studying it under a magnifier but in the end you gotta test it the usual way. There is definitely some skill and willpower involved in smoking current weed and not getting too high especially in social settings. But if you practice practice practice you can get good at it.

7917186,0,t3_4npqp1,Physiologically our brains dont stop developing until were in our mid twenties. One of the parts that continues to develop is the prefrontal cortex which plays a large part in something called executive functioning. This is important because our executive functioning is our ability to control ourselves. Its what lets us say No I shouldnt smoke that now. People with ADHD often have a hard time with this and its because of how their prefrontal cortices are affected. What Im trying to say is this is why its not a great idea to smoke heavily as a teenager or to do anything else that requires a lot of self control in order to lower risks. As your executive functioning improves youll find yourself able to control your impulses more easily. Youll tell yourself what you should do and it wont be so hard to just do it. But until then its useful to use outside controls like not keeping any reefer in your house. Its kind of a bummer but its temporary. And the flip side is that if you cant control how much you smoke it can start to interfere with other things. One of the more ridiculous dilemmas in our societies is that we plop  year olds in a  kg vehicle and tell them to be safe. Its almost absurd to expect people that age to drive safely all the time. Most of them do most of the time. But if you dont do it safely EVERY time you can still wind up in trouble. I think youre doing the right thing.

Whenever the vet prescribed powerful pharmaceuticals for him we always became concerned from the change in his attitude. We could tell the high from the painkillers was affecting him and that he wasnt processing this very well. It just made him more lethargic than before when he was visibly in pain. The steroids made him very irritable and hed pick fights with the other dogs. We were worried how he was processing the effects from those heavy pain killers and steroids they kept giving him which is what lead us to researching alternatives. He exhibits none of the previous concerning symptoms from cannabis while still enjoying the benefits of pain relief. Hes probably enjoying some improvement in mood as well considering his improved behavior.

9368422,0,t3_58pd7w,Personally biggest thing is strains. Its been an issue for me because of my lack of ability to go to a dispensary. When I get a quality Sativa strain I would argue it even helps my productivity in certain areas. Lately Ive been having an issue with getting what I want when I want. So I actually just stopped buying for a bit. I really dont like being Indicad out when Im trying to live my life. To me it might as well be a different drug.I think its good to play with being sober as well. I tried to stop for a good bit because I was curious if it was affecting my life. I felt pretty stupid cause it was like life without coffee not really different and I still wanted to do it. Figure out how weed works for you. I can smoke all the time and I feel great. But some really cant and it effects them differently. My coworkers probably appreciate when I come in high more than I do. Helps me be more excited about doing really dull work.Also being able to stop to keep you from spending money is a great asset.

9425530,0,t3_59q303,gt I just wish I could figure out if I need to quit weed or If I just need to surround my self with more productive peopleFrom my own experiences I will say that its mostly who you surround yourself with. However weed itself is usually a deadbeat friend who doesnt want to do anything for me. Meaning even if you surrounded yourself with totally bad ass people you may do less overall with your life because toking up can have the same effect your deadbeat friends do lets just sink into this chair for a few hours and basically do nothing. My advice would be to certainly surround yourself with more productive people thats almost a given for anyone very few people can be highly productive for long periods while being surrounded by total losers its just hard to do but also you shouldnt see weed as a every time I get high I am more socialable more personable more active etc.. because in my experiences from smoking daily those effects are rarer than they seem and are largely due to your mood before you even got high. A month of getting high every night for me I would say only  days are highs that are awesome productive useful etc.. the rest are just like driving to work everyday nothing special that may not have hurt me but also didnt help me. If you arent doing shit with those hours anyway then IMO it doesnt matter if you spend them high or not.Weed itself will not help you in the long term you have to build up your life separately from weed. Dont look at it as the magic bullet either by quitting or doing it more or less. Its something you do. I watch TV shows they generally dont help or hurt my life. I smoke weed it generally doesnt help or hurt my life. Your issues were there before weed and weed has not helped them. Focus on those issues outside the context of weed because as you are finding out quitting is not some magic bullet. For some they have to quit to be able to focus on those things but other people just have to cut back while others dont have to change a thing. You have to figure this one out yourself and your current break is helping you to do that. You have to be honest with yourself if you are smoking too much and to cut backthis sounds contradictory to what Ive been saying but there is definitely a limit you cant just smoke an ounce a day and expect to be a high functioning adult. Make efforts to be moderate and take note of your life and how weed is affecting it for me it was never a cause or solution to any problems just a way to kill time while ignoring other problems that I would ignore even without weed.If you stop working out because you got high first or put off an assignment because you got high or start losing sleep because you got high then you need to take a step back from it and reevaluate its position in your life. But if you are still getting shit done and being an adult other than these feelings of depressionanxiety then I think youve confirmed weed wasnt the smoking gun of your problems. I think that smoking is generally a consequence of those feelings not a cause.,eldertrees,d9ar1gu,3,t5_2tclf
9524665,0,t1_d9n2r9l,Never throw it away friend! Cannabis will last for many years in a sealed canning jar and will never be unsafe to consume as long as it isnt showing visible mold. If its super sticky stuff you are going to want to burp your sealed canning jar maybe  times a week to to continue the cure and get better potency and flavor. Just open the jar and allow air exchange for around  minutes. To get better results for oxygen circulation I personally like to invert the jar on its side and roll it with my hand over the opening. This should break up any clumps of bud you have sticking together and give you a more even cure. For long term storage and curing I love Boveda  two way moisture control packs   These will keep your bud delicious and potent for many years to come.They will also draw out excess moisture if the interior of the jar has reached above  relative humidity. I have  year old weed that is still lovely after being stored in this fashion. You will have a small loss in potency over time but in my experience and research this usually amounts to less than  potency loss per year in the aforementioned storage conditions especially if you dont open the jar that often after your cure is complete.Happy curing!,eldertrees,d9n47gt,14,t5_2tclf

With no grinding packing or heating up its almost too easy to take another rip an hour later and keep it going.I typically notice that when I switch between the oil pen to vaping flower or smoking flower I get way high off less than I expect. They all build the tolerance but after vaping the pen only for a while hitting the bubbler fucks me right up. Edibles  Id recommend these for days you want to hit a . This is my go to when Im staying in on a Friday night playing video games or watching TV. You might want to try it out when you dont have shit to do the next day because if you eat a lot you are going to want to sleep in and you may be groggy when you wake up. Again they will affect your tolerance but it is a different quality of high than vaping the pax. Remember You can always eat more you cant eat less.With THC just like with booze and opiates you will need more and more to get the same high.

If you are inclined to anger as it seems a lot of us ents tend to be it can take that away and make life...gentle. Its an amazing feeling. That being said you dont have to deal with the anger being there. Its not so much of an addiction thing as a weakening on your builtin coping mechanisms. I mean why condition yourself to not be mad when you stay high and dont experience anger? So you smoke for a while straight and come off. All of a sudden you find yourself getting angry. Really angry. You think Man if I could just smoke a bowl it would all go away which is true but thats because its become a crutch. Your mind isnt used to being angry and you have become mentally weaker because of it. Not trying to be insulting with that...Like someone else said live better. Exercise eat right surround yourself with some good. Maybe seek help for learning to healthily cope with anger. But overall be good bro. lt,eldertrees,ddn81pj,7,t5_2tclf

10951602,0,t1_de9j3va,I dont fully follow what your concern is? With rescheduling an idea being floated around right now Cannabis to a Schedule  we push it into the hands of big pharma because schedule  substances must be dispensed through a pharmacy. What these gentlemen are proposing is to deschedule completely and let the states decide how they want to handle it. It will no longer be a federal issue it will no longer be a controlled substance. The state law will supersede federal law. ,eldertrees,de9kw3m,18,t5_2tclf
11005646,0,t1_deff34q,But does it impact a developing brain in an adverse or beneficial way? Cannabinoids are present in and essential for fetal development. In our current society many mothers have a deficient endocannabinoid system. In the Jamaican study babies born to cannabis consuming mothers thrived better in the first months of development. They would not likely outthrive other babies if their brain development was adversely affected. If babies were adversely affected by this wouldnt we se it as we see it with other drug babies?  ,eldertrees,defgj2j,1,t5_2tclf

11765371,0,t1_dgti34e,I didnt ask for medical advice I specifically asked for personal advice. At least from my experience a neurologist would not give any advice on Cannabis and seizures specifically. However they are a consenting adult in a legal state and their doctor is aware of the use. Heavy Rx use without control is useless and dangerous possibly leading to toxicity or even an injury causing or fatal seizure event.So they decided to explore Cannabis as a personal choice and are aware that who they speak to about it does not give concrete absolute advice. So far they have had very little success talking to anyone about it in terms of suggestions and dont really know where to start.So in this imperfect world Im trying to provide a little direction and help to a confused person who wants to pursue this option and Ive already told them anything we discuss is not medical advice.,eldertrees,dgtmv5b,5,t5_2tclf
