20328,0,t1_cegpw8x,LoS was probably my favorite game in  so needless to say Im pretty excited about LoS. I really wish that they were releasing it for NextGen though. ,castlevania,cegqx0b,1,t5_2ss33

143226,0,t3_1v8yew,Its not a bad game but it has nothing that made the original and metroidvania style games awesome. So if you like beatemups LoS is good for you but if you want a Castlevania that plays like a Castlevania it doesnt suffice. I said it wasnt a bad game...but I take that back. It sucks shit. Mash buttons till everything is dead and then do some platforming which basically just looks cool but isnt engaging at all sums up the game. I should probably give it a second chance...but idk. I hate how you get some new ability which really just lets you unlock some shit pathway. Also the music is just generic Hollywood bleh that isnt memorable at all. I enjoyed the DS one for the first two acts and the final battle though. Hated the recycled mini bosses and huge quick time event sequences in the third act.But yaknow opinions and stuff.,castlevania,ceuqsn6,-1,t5_2ss33
448083,0,t3_1z7dyr,Unless I misunderstood the question I believe it put you in the save before the fight so that you continue the real game and go for the good ending. I remember getting the bad ending and playing normally fine. It wont reset your entire game if that is what youre thinking. ,castlevania,cfr7it5,1,t5_2ss33

546150,0,t3_20cvbg,Do Chapter  runs on hard and go for the purple chests in order to get the Ebisu Raiment a cape that raises rare item chance.Chapter  Normal the final boss can drop Thief Rings. ideally two of those and the Raiment combined with playing a character that has a small drop pool Fuma seems to be best will considerably even the odds in your favour.,castlevania,cg2cqva,2,t5_2ss33
725474,0,t3_22f0bw,I honestly would still love Konami to port Harmony of Despair over to PC. Put it on Steamworks and include all the DLC in one nice nifty package and Id definitely get it again. Just makes more sense on PC to me at least.,castlevania,cgmqnaw,8,t5_2ss33
889682,0,t3_249ahr,I can see the effort that you guys put in but there is no persona or charisma between dialogue narrative or instruction. The video felt very rigid and the Castlevania series for NES and SNES has been done to death. If you do a classic as a review then bring new insight or at least some comedic banter that helps the viewer enjoy the video and remind them of their own experience with the game. Your costar needs a lot of work but I think that there may exist a language barrier for him that restrains him from expressing and delivering jokes with the proper inflection or tone. Nonetheless keep up the work and more viewers will follow. ,castlevania,ch5eshk,3,t5_2ss33

8045340,0,t1_d4jshd9,I also loved the LoS brand...the gameplay although obviously takes pages from GoW and DmC it fits the game well...the boss battles take the shadow of the colossus idea which is kinda neat within the hack n slash format giving you something to look forward too while trudging through levels...the stories what sold me it does get a little predictable bout half way but then it takes another bizarre twist I alctually ddnt think of..I like how hes a Belmont but his name is Gabriel so its like they took the gods arch angel idea and wrapped it with van helsing. The soundtracks what you would expect from a Konami game and has a little orchestra added in probably kojimas input there also...all in all I say its a an underrated take on the franchise and alctually pretty well done. I liked it enough to get the vampire killer cross tattooed on me haha...high recommend ,castlevania,d4kdf32,1,t5_2ss33
8132262,0,t1_d4ty1dn,Because I experienced it late I knew about the inverted Castle But the game is long enough that I could definitely see lots of people think theyve reached a definitive end with the Richter fight found all of the optional bosses etc. And that maybe the missing abilities were some kind of cheat code or something to do with the chairs. What other RPGs did you play around that time if you remember? History is lost more and more each day its nice to hear these kind of stories. ,castlevania,d4u515u,1,t5_2ss33

10845723,0,t1_ddy8pqq,I searched castlevania because I heard about Netflix doing a thing. Your post brought back memories of looking at walk through text printed off at the library! So awesome! Thanks. Now its been literally years but I think all youre missing is the secret where you get outside the castle wall and can turn some of that area blue. Iirc its at the top of the staircase part that is by the save point farthest to the left. I think you need sword brothers to do it.... Ill go look up a video and post it now since you got my memories soaring. Edit well I didnt know about this one and its the only one I could find online in the  mins I looked. Maybe my mind is wrong but I thought it was for sure on the left side. Anyways heres the vid that is nothing like what I remember but does get you outside...,castlevania,ddynrwt,2,t5_2ss33

11308802,0,t3_60ljz8,While I enjoy Dracula as a villain playing as him in a setting where he was anything less than absurdly powerful feels odd to me and I am in the minority of Castlevania players in that I never found Alucard too compelling. As a result I never really had a desire to play the LoS trilogy. Glad you enjoy them at least!,castlevania,dfdu39s,2,t5_2ss33
11375097,0,t1_dflbkr4,I fell in love with that Simon exclusive as soon as it was announced lt haha was worth every penny! AND its massive!  also great they used bendy wire for the whip to mimic the exact cover of Castlevania for NES or if you want to change the whip you can pose it anyway you like  Dracula was a lot cheaper but he was also a smaller scale. Im just glad theyre VERY flexible with their payment plans  I got their Majoras Mask replica on preorder its as little as month for  or  months the overall price is big but the little payments make it manageable to each their own though!  ,castlevania,dflcj2c,2,t5_2ss33

I actually missed out on Symphony of the night in its prime and had this instead via blockbuster GBA system rentals Yes they totally did that!. What a surprise it was to find out that all of the enemy sprites from this game and the later DS releases that I liked so much all came from SOTN.I really like the Rocs feather upgrade in COTM though. Its essentially the same as Alucards superjump downUp but on just one button and completely spammable R,castlevania,dghnmxe,2,t5_2ss33
11666581,0,t3_5w9mza,I havent played many of the older castlevanias.. Circle of the Moon first CV game I ever played and IMO it holds up. Symphony of the Night. Order of Ecclesia. Aria of Sorrow. Portrait of Ruin. Dawn of Sorrow. Curse of Darkness. Lament of Innocence. Castlevania The Lords of Shadow games while highly enjoyable I prefer to rank separately because they are completely different games plus different storyuniverse and such. Lords of Shadow. Lords of Shadow . Mirror of FateEDIT only Metroidvania I havent played is Harmony of Dissonance though from what I hear its one of if not the weakest one,castlevania,dgif7ii,1,t5_2ss33
