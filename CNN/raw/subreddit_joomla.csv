You dont need to reproduce the site in  hoursbut you should be able to get a landing page together that covers the minimum you need in the site.   Work from there.  ,joomla,chgj23u,-1,t5_2qklr

1204669,0,t3_27vpcy,Creating a homepage that allows navigation like that is pretty easy and what you require here is an appropriate component for managing the data county information such as population figures median income square mileage and other demographic type information so Id like to see some complete examples of that before I can advise on what would be the best way to present it with a reasonable way for updating it regularly.,joomla,ci5564k,2,t5_2qklr

3990520,0,t1_crazhmj,exactley what sharkon said. I rcently used SobiPro to import over  entries into a staff directory. All works well but can be a little counter intuitive also you have to pay for a subscription to use the import facility.Has lots of nice features with the added subscription modules for instance I needed to be able to assign each staff member to a department and in some cases multiple deparmtents. SobiPro let me load up the list of over  different departments into a multiselect box again importing from a file. ,joomla,crb5jet,2,t5_2qklr
