3922890,0,t3_35a9h8,Well... I am not an expert. I have a Buhund Snorre whom is  months. We got him when he was  weeks old. I have not owned any other dog or any other breeds for that matter. My family had a Airedale Terrier which passed when I was a kid. So my point of reference is a bit week. However my perception of the Buhund as a breed is that it can be a handful. This depends on where you live how much work you want to put into the dog and what your ambitions are. As a first time dog Ill say it is probably a more sensible choice than for example a rottie. But if you have low expectations of how much training youll put into the dog dont worry too much about obedience etc. you might be better off with for instance a Bichon Frisee or similar. When we god Snorre the breeder shared some stories from young couples as ourself who had a Buhund as their first dog. He said that in general it was a good match. What I am trying to say is that a Buhund can be a good first time dog but it still needs to be trained. At the same time its a dog that requires some independence so too much training can make it stressed out snorre struggles with this Ive been pushing him too hard. Then again every dog is different! Depends on where you live ambitions etc. ,buhund,cr3g1qh,1,t5_365db
