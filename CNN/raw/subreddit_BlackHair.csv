3288503,0,t3_2xqr7m,Make sure you use a wide tooth comb and some waterconditioner to detangle before a wash. After shampooing I also detangle with a wide tooth comb and conditoner. Then rinse. As black women we grow up believing that all hairstyles come at a painful price. I remember sitting between my momauntsisters knees while they yanked narrowtoothed combs through my dry kinky hair. From root to tip. You just close your eyes against the tears and go to your happy place. Not sure how long your hair is but I just did a big chop and have a little fro  inches. Ive been wearing washandgo fros recently and heres my routine  Once a week I wash condition and detangle with a widetooth comb. Then rinse out the conditioner and during this whole process Im fairly gentle with it making sure not to ruin any of the curls from the detangle. I apply a little bit of oil then a leavein on damp hair split it into large sections and rake some gel through each section with fingers. Once it sets you have a defined fro that lasts a week. Every day I spritz it with a wateroil mixture and use a pick at the roots to lift and shape I dont run the pick all the way through the hair. It softens up over a few days if youre worried about the rigid gel set. Doing it this way I lose very little hair. Eventually I want to find a softer set with less products.Mine usually resembles this picture I found online TLDR Washandgos for little fros.,BlackHair,cp346bv,1,t5_2ulof
3586637,0,t3_2zzw10,. Im not sure. I was told that the they dont but touching up is much easier.. They take a shorter time to do.. The larger ones will be a bit heavier but styling would probably be the same. ,BlackHair,cq13s16,2,t5_2ulof
3792609,0,t3_33ss9b,My hair used to look like your when it was shorter. I stopped using shampoo because I couldnt find a good one that wasnt stripping my hair. I use hello hydration by herbal essences because it is cheap it smells nice and it does help keep my hair soft. I use the LiquidOilCream method but i use oil last to keep my hair moist. For liquid i usually use creme of nature argan oil spray but you can use any product that has water as a main ingredient or just make your own with water and a light oil. For cream I use cantu argan oil conditioner or their repair cream. Then I seal with jamaican black castor oil mixed with something that smells nice because I hate the smell. Silk bonnets or silk pillowcases help to not dry your hair out. I do a treatment on my hair once a week and a protein treatment once every  weeks. Also trim trim trim if youre anything like me you get those god forsaken fairy knots at the ends of your hair which leads to breakage.The most important thing is to try and make a routine I usually give something  weeks if it doesnt work for me then  I switch it up. TLDR avoid shampoo or try a shampoo that doesnt have any sulfates or harsh chemicals LOC method for moisture silk bonnet or pillowcase to not dry out your hair treatments test out products and if they dont benefit you get rid of them and try something else trim often!,BlackHair,cqol65o,2,t5_2ulof

4962853,0,t1_cuk384f,I had used eco styler years ago when I hadnt been natural for too long. Ill have to try the olive oil one. I remember eco styler being fairly cheap. I cant remember what I didnt like about it. My problems with gel have been either its too stiff or not nearly stiff enough. I love how my hair looks with kinky curly but its expensive as hell and has this wet feeling that lasts forever and I cant stand the feeling but my hair only looks good for as long as it feels wet.Looking at your other pictures though you have a looser curl pattern than I do. So my results are likely to be different. How does the eco styler feel in your hair? I want a gel thatll be strong enough to make the curls act like they like each other but flexible enough that I dont end up with a hard helmet of hair. And of course it needs to dry so I dont feel like I just got a Jheri curl. It always felt like I was asking for a lot from a product or combination of products so I basically resigned myself to gel for special occasions when I could tolerate the hair sticking to my neck for a few hours. Sorry I didnt intend for this to turn into a rant book.,BlackHair,cuk3ue3,1,t5_2ulof

6622876,0,t1_d04d0ly,No prob at allAs for the comb I mean this little guy. Really good for tightly curledcoarse hair.Check local drugstores before amazon and I guarantee youll find it cheaper. You want the wavy double row of teeth not the single straight ones.,BlackHair,d04d1up,2,t5_2ulof
6644916,0,t3_46nwah,Id be worried it was bogged down with chemical fragranceBut! I would suggest buying any kind of sprayable coconut oil and you can add coconut essential oil on your ownProbably wouldnt need more than  drops. If that oil you had wasnt an unnatural horror show Im betting that was what gave it the much stronger fragrance,BlackHair,d06n4de,1,t5_2ulof

8354983,0,t3_4tp76i,I think you scarf might have been to tight. Anything tight around your edges will make the issue worse. I would just use the satin pillowcase from now on. I would also not pull my edges back in any style until the edges have grown in and even then loosely tied styles an avoid repetitive styles where the hair is pulled back.,BlackHair,d5lxc33,2,t5_2ulof
8362620,0,t3_4tzdl7,I mean its your hair and you should be able to do whatever you want to it as long as you like it but it looks a little too wild. If you got a bald fade on your sides and back it would look better. But if you wanna look clean but keep those dreads you should probably get your hair twisted by someone who knows what theyre doing.,BlackHair,d5mvnt8,2,t5_2ulof

I just had a stylist like that who cut too much off and Im going to someone else with a better reputation soon who is used to doing natural hair.

11425198,0,t1_dfr0cpf,What do you do after you take them out? My hair will shed too but I dont comb it. I finger detangle. If your hair seems like its thinning Id suggest a protein treatment but not too often since too much protein is bad too. My hair will feel softer not sure about thinner because its stretched and my coils are looser. Definitely find a a youtuber and see if some of their videos can help you out. Edit I dont do long term! I just thought about that. My longest style is about two or three weeks. Flat twists two strands cornrows. My hair is in  jumbo two strands that I have tucked into a ponytail bun for  now. This will last a few weeks. If you can go even  to  days without touching your hair youre helping yourself in the long run. Youre doing great to notice what works and what doesnt for you! ,BlackHair,dfr19d9,3,t5_2ulof
11634306,0,t3_65yimi,Go ahead and get them. My aunt is   black and still very much identifies as being black and embraces black culture. Her hair is almost straight with simple light curlswaves at the bottom. She also raises my cousins as black their father is black and not multiracial.Even if you are  black you are still part black. Thanks for being mindful of appropriation however you are still a part of our culture in my opinion. You may not be of fully black ancestry however you still possess African ancestry. Also your braids may not last. I got Senegalese twist earlier this year and they barely lasted a month. I have fine c hair and the twists began to slip.,BlackHair,dgerezi,2,t5_2ulof
