9515097,0,t1_d9lwj65,If your question is whether a particular statement is defamatory the answer is I dont know and have no way of knowing.  It depends in general on  the statement and  the applicable law.  I know neither but even if I did the best I could probably do is tell you reasons why it may be viewed as defamatory and reasons why it may not.  ,KFTalk,d9lxspc,2,t5_3f9hh
10036423,0,t1_dbe26yy,Thanks for the reply glad to hear you guys have plans to further monetize the platformservice.If I may ask what is the estimated cost to resolve a failed COOP when the owner is semi or totally not cooperative? ,KFTalk,dbfrtdo,1,t5_3f9hh
10453893,0,t1_dcszw0n,Yup. As evident of them deleting the getgrowing Reddit page their answer to criticism is silence. They have no intention of hearing whats wrong with their business. ,KFTalk,dct1vok,2,t5_3f9hh
10472034,0,t1_dcv0cui,Thanks for reporting this.gt KF reported APR  .Actual APR  .How did you get to .?  Our formula runs as profit months.  So for that one its . which gives me . There is an error here some of the others I ran with the above formula came back wrong so Im sure theres something going on.  I just want to verify were using the same formula.,KFTalk,dcv42nk,1,t5_3f9hh
10513629,0,t1_dczqh9e,Youre braver than I.  Im also too poor to afford to fight KF when they eventually come after me for saying unflattering things about them.  ,KFTalk,dcztyr0,1,t5_3f9hh
10545909,0,t1_dcwt369,With talk of doxxing and of Trustpilot reviews etc. for those who are interested in whether KF are trustworthy or not you might want to take a look at one of the most recent star reviews.  Apart from all the very suspicious star reviews on Trustpilot theres one name in particular which seems familiar.  Seems kinda similar to a certain VP of Operations and Business Development.     Of course fake reviews by the business are against Trustpilot TampCs.,KFTalk,dd3hvv3,1,t5_3f9hh

10682951,0,t1_ddht3t2,Its  of the owners of that particular consignmentcoop. It doesnt have anything to do with how active you are on the site.KF users who dont buy a particular coop dont get to access the backer board for that coop.In your example if there is a few individuals who make up the majority of the coop by  ownership I think it is limited to  per person and they all vote noconfidence and it is over  regardless. The opposite is true. If the numerical majory vote noconfidence but say they only own  of  of the  in the coop it will go noconfidence. This is the case with Titin Tech. You should look into this coop for example of how things can go wrong.KF currently has very limited ability to do anything when an offer goes no confidence.,KFTalk,ddhv65p,1,t5_3f9hh
