5875,0,t1_ceeynvx,Yeah just a lot of people are thinking it will be similar in setting to any of the games and its really far off  it occurs like  years before talos united the realm and created the empire the vast majority of the lore from the games has not happened yet.

15298,0,t1_ceg65a0,Just because TOR failed out of EAs greed and Biowares inability to keep up partly due to the shortcomings of copying WoWs approach on endgame doesnt mean it founded a new mold every upcoming MMO has to fit in that of the aspiring new thing failing due to the inability to keep up the pace. Huge part of this is  as I just wrote  the inability to dish out content with such a short shelf life.Which in itself is happening because of the low player investment requirements aka too casual orientated. With ZOS seemingly not that focused on this particular style of endgame raids namely I dont seeing it happen again. We do already know of several pieces of planned postrelease content which bring some very anticipated aspects to the game Thieves Guild Dark Brotherhood and a justice system with it. Of course there is still chance to screw up big time with their model of endgame with PvP getting stale tol fast which I personally doubt or the content flow being too scarce which I cant comment on of course but its not like we can already predict a TORtanic II happening.Btw TORs content kinda trippled in the meantime and the quality isnt that bad neither which lead to EA admitting that they might have pulled the plug way to early.,elderscrollsonline,ceg6ccc,5,t5_2tqi0

Like I said eso does seem like it may get closer then  anyone has before. I am not sure you can really inspire the same depth of investment if the progression is to easy.

95318,0,t3_1v6uwj, NonMMO gamers shouldnt expect a single player TES game with ESO. It has online in the title. I cant see this being an issue. With the versatility that comes with all the skills once they become available there will be plenty of options and playstyles. Look at games that have  actionbars and a ton of skills. For combat you either end up using the same  skills anyway or you use way too many and combat ends up being tedious. This isnt a traditional MMO. Questing dungeons are a primary focus for ESO. And the PvP zone has questing and other activities to keep people busy who want to see the other faction so Ive heard. Given the storylineworldlore it wouldnt make sense for the factions to see each other constantly.  The aim based combat in my opinion is refreshing I know this isnt a first for an MMO and way more engaging than tabtargeting. I never noticed not once that the megaserver was separating me from anyone. In my opinion all these speculations are doing is comparing ESO with most MMOs. But the thing is is that its pretty different. I think it gathers a ton of elements from many popular titles puts them together and makes it work. I dont want the same game with a different skin Wildstar comes to mind.All in all yes things WILL go wrong but I think that every major online release has something that goes wrong. Whether its a server issue a bugexploit whatever. Thats why we pay a sub fee for these things to get fixed in a timely manner. ,elderscrollsonline,cepa5vr,1,t5_2tqi0

169496,1,t3_1w0n5b,Im going to be blunt  I dont think st person will work for TESO at all. Why? Number of reasons. Main one is the loss of situational awareness. Your field of view in st person is severely reduced compared to rd person. You cannot see an enemy at your  oclock winding up a huge attack. Is that realistic? Yes it is in real life you would be unable to fight someone in front of you and keep an eye on someone behind you. But in real life you also cannot pass THROUGH people the way you can in TESO I believe it was confirmed that theres no collision detection between characters?As such you cannot form a wall or hold the gates the way you could in Darkfall for example. In that game you could put two ranks of Mahirim wolfmen tallest race in the game in the gates of your city and nothing would get through. And st person combat would have been fine with that game like in Mortal Online.Although funnily enough in Darkfall the melee combat was rd person and spellcastingarchery was st person only. Why? Situational awareness again. As melee youd be expected to be in the thick of it. And in the st person you cant really see what is happening immediately to your left or right your field of view isnt wide enough. So a simple task of forming a line in the gates and holding that line is very hard to do solely in st person and even more difficult to maintain. And this is the simplest possible formation a line across the entrance. Imagine trying to maintain formation in open combat? Impossible in st person.In short I really dont think devs should waste any time on making st person combat any better than it already is as shown in recent PvE video. Combat overall can be improved yes but specifically st person is probably useless.My best proof of this is WoW. You can play it in st person the camera allows it. But NOBODY plays like that. Why? No collision detection no situational awareness. You will not find a single raiding guild raiding in st person. Youd die horribly if you cant see around you to see when something is coming at you from the side or from behind. You also wont find a single highrated arena team playing in st person. It just cant be done any team playing in rd person would wipe you. In terms of realism yes st person is more realistic. And better for some things such as longdistance combat. But for most applications rd person is superior. To put it bluntly you can play in st person if you prefer but you will NOT be competitive. Its not even up for debate. It is too easily provable considering theres no collision detection.I do understand some players may prefer it that way. In many games it made sense. For example Eye of the Beholder series. Tight corridors  collision made st person the only reasonable choice. Not to mention that textured true D was not up yet the game used pseudoD using D plates to assemble the view. The point is it worked. It also worked in Ultima Underworld Stygian Abyss. That one still had sprites rather than meshes for enemies but the world itself was true D geometry. Thing is there were very few enemies they usually came at you  at a time in a straight line the AI was pissweak bordering on nonexistent. It worked though. But when you take a game like TESO with large open world tons of players around you many of whom are trying to kill you and try to do it in st person Im sorry but youll be the first to die and be less efficient than even the keyboard turner while doing so. As such I just dont see the need to spend time and money on st person. Its nice to have especially for ranged combat I LOVE that we have the option. But its enough as it is.Then again Im also against hiring bigname actors and wasting a lot of money on voiceovers. Age of Conan spent a ton of time and money on voice acting and crashed. SWTOR spent even more time and money on voice acting and also crashed. Oblivion and Skyrim had voice acting too but I still prefer Morrowind to these other two even though it had no voice acting besides the minimal greetings dismissals combat. So this is just my opinion  money and time spent on it could probably have been better spent elsewhere in the game.,elderscrollsonline,cexqltb,-1,t5_2tqi0

214753,0,t3_1wkjp6,Yeah under NDA nobody can say right now.They promised an API in the same language that WoW used for its addons Lua. But it doesnt mean the API will be as detailed as WoWs. What I mean is WoW API had things like the modifiers hold down shift and your spell and icon can change in the same keybind. So  was Drain Life and Shift was Drain Mana for my warlock for example. This most likely will NOT work like this in TESO. Itll probably be much more simplistic than that.So I wouldnt expect any serious addons or user mods. Changing the size and location of some things? Sure. But it probably wont be even close to as moddable as WoW. I certainly dont expect it to have capability like putting mining nodes on the minimap or anything like that.I could be wrong of course. But just based on screenshots of the UI and what we already know about the games design and combat mechanics they cant let us have much without endangering balance.,elderscrollsonline,cf2wl3z,2,t5_2tqi0
215078,0,t1_cf2tg6n,This reminds me most recently of the swtor beta leaks.

I was lucky enough to be in the last stress test. Ive set my expectations accordingly. I dont need someone else to tell me why they wont be playing. I know why I will be and thats all I need. Im not expecting a WoW killer and ive played other sub mmos and hell Ive even preordered before. I cant begin to imagine why any of these things are suddenly a problem for everyone when it wasnt for other games. None of those things matter none of them. I loved swtor for what it was. All of the naysayers can screw themselves because in the end even if it did go fp i enjoyed the months i played it. It was worth the money and if i could go back Id do it all again. I had fun in the ESO beta enough to warrant buying it. For those who have tight budgets sign up for the beta wait for one of the other stress tests which are sure to come and make up your own minds.

222367,0,t1_cf3rm8s,The problem is you are zeroing in on just the racial ability not any of the potentially infinite external factors that have to be accounted for.  Yes if you can plant your feet and run through your rotation without moving or worrying every player will be able to take advantage of the benefits.Simply requiring people to move during fights which is true for nearly every encounter ever will immediately diminish the number of people that can properly use the benefits even flat bonuses like HP and Damage.  Add in damage having to change movement patterns multiple targets unexpected circumstances that change the flow of the fights the target itself etc. etc. and there is a vast gap between the players that can effectively use that  in practical situations and the players who can only take advantage of it on a target dummy where all theory crafting is accomplished.I cant reiterate this enough player skill and experience far outweighs minor statistical gains from racial abilities and some perceived superior racial abilities might actually be inferior.

Well probably see a flurry of press from sites all at once at some point in the next week or so.

235766,0,t1_cf56gus,Very good write up thank you for posting it.Why do you suppose DAoC and EQ had the staying power that they did? EQ had absolutely pisspoor PvP and the number of raids out of the gate were abysmal. Granted it made up for this with dramatically different leveling experiences based on the myriad races you could be. Though that could just be the altholic in me talking.DAoC if I recall had pretty horrid PvE endgame at first before that huge PvPcontrolled dungeon came about I cant remember its name but its way PvP system was extremely robust. Still though why did it not in your opinion suffer from the same problem that GW  and WAR did and ESO may where the backandforth doesnt actually make much of a difference?Thanks in advance!,elderscrollsonline,cf56qjm,0,t5_2tqi0

I can call eso sandbox because I can make a mage with a bow in plate and not be restricted to a specifix path with specific spells amd be exactly the same and the next dozen mages all wearing and seeking the same gear.If all you want to do is world build and play house you should stick to minecraft or eq landmarl.  Teso is not the game for you and wanting such things clearly means you never played the previous es games as it is about building your character and questing not playing house and having ken over for tea.Player generated content is terrible and lame and a lot of others words I should not use.  I for one am glad eso does not support it as then it would not be elder scrolls.  Open world housong ruined UO and SWG.

I can in reality not run through a city without being robbedI dont see you as someone who want to steal from people or a person who cant possibly imagine another waywhatever. I see you as someone with legit reasoning behind your claim but the thing is that this isnt limited to pickpocketing a lot of other things inevitably gets put in the same box.There will probably not be collision within friendly players because then getting through a city would be so incredibly infuriating that people would get a negative view of the game.There will not be skyrimesque range on bows because getting hurt without being able to apply counterplay is absolutely atrocious.There are more scenarios like this as you might imagine.I agree with you engaging with the server is fucking amazing. An entire server helping the top guild to summon Prince Thunderaan before the other servers? What an amazing event that was.Zombie raiding in preWotLK? How fun and engaging that was. But what about the people that felt obligued to help summon thunderaan whilst they wanted to do other things? What about the people that actually needed to actually access the city? They just straight up felt bad about playing the game. Something that could be avoided and now is. World of Warcraft has made this mistake a few times and thats the reason no other game does this now.EDIT Engaging players is fun and exciting pickpocketing isnt the way to do it.If you dont wish to see this then well agree to disagree.,elderscrollsonline,cfaelhz,0,t5_2tqi0

293782,0,t3_1xgal7,Its more enjoyable than I thought it would be but nothing about the game has given me that certain feeling  that special something that just screams TAKE MY MONEY! I hate to throw a name like World of Warcraft out there but when I played that game on release day and saw how wonderfully fluid the animation was how even the default key bindings fit my style of play and just how easily I understood how things worked and fell into play I knew at that moment that I would play that game for a long time to come and definitely throw money at it to continue.Im not getting any of those feelings with TESO. It all feels incredibly... average. I have the graphics maxed out and the only thing I feel shows it is the backdrop of the zone Im in the second zone not including the starter zone for everyone in the Dark ElfArgonianNord story. The character animations are the most disappointing to me. Like all previous installments of ES animations feel incredibly wooden. Scroll into a third person view and you look like a stick figure swinging an axe. So far the progression is really linear though I think Im only like level  or . Im hoping it branches out near midgame. I guess Ill have to wait for later betas to see that. I do however love the exploration. I love gathering up materials and making stuff. Im a little miffed at why it requires ten of any one raw material to make a one to five materials to craft with. Seems a little steep but hey just gives me another reason to go snooping for more stuff. I do also enjoy not having to purchase items to gather resources with Im pointing at you GW!.As it stands I cant see myself paying  AND mo with microtransactions thrown in just to play an average game.

294392,1,t1_cfb7wou,sighHave you ever tried to rent a cloud computing service? Have you ever had to manage a scalable server infrastructure? Im guessing you havent because again it seems you dont quite know what youre talking about.To keep it simple let me just say that even scalable infrastructures megaservers or cloud computing whatever you want to call it have a certain scaling factor. If the speed of new players trying to log in increases faster than the speed the server is configured or is capable to scale to the server will reach max capacity.Even beyond that and Im simplifying this theres still a hard cap. Servers dont just spring up out of nowhere they are physical things that Zenimax need to pay for. And obviously they will only pay for as many as they think they need theyd be stupid not to so if more players are trying to log in than the max server capacity they pay for the servers will reach max capacity.,elderscrollsonline,cfba24u,-2,t5_2tqi0

And its hard to step away from that outlook as well especially if you only play  or  hours into the game.But I kept playing and it does certainly has potential. My issue has mostly to do with the fact its an mmo lag freezing due to too many players on screen or in server respawns waiting for respawns people blinking or sprinting to that gathering spot I was aiming for. Stuff like that. Other than that I did enjoy the game nice combat nice quests excellent voice cast superb music best looking mmo out there. Im afraid though I cant get past the freezing.

Its just not fun when you have to artificially handicap yourself compared to everyone else.I really wish MMOs had quest lines and discoverable things done in a procedural way where every person has a different randomized version. Like the best fishing location for each person could be randomly selected from a list of all fishing location and the books pointing to that location also randomized. This way not only do people get close to unique experiences but there is an actual challenge that everyone needs to do and they cannot cheat their way around it. Everyone who found a hard to discover item or place truly earned it.Kind of like a procedurally generated phasing for quests and hidden items or discoverable locations.,elderscrollsonline,cfcl432,13,t5_2tqi0

The hype and excitement lasted just until the immersion pulled me into what I daresay redefines MMORPG it has lots of similar features to other MMOs but not enough of anything to make it a clone. Its a lot of elder scrolls but seamlessly puts in multiplayer. I think the most overrated feature is the dynamic grouping. I went in very much expecting to be playing a single player game with other people around which I was fine with but as an early boss appeared giant fire demon that that dark elf summoned you know the one I found myself grouping with other people with a similar problem before I could say maybe I should level some more we quickly tag teamed them and boom that was the moment I realised what it was. My previous statement actually is why I think a lot  of TES fans might be turned off. In the elder scrolls since time immemorial you had a boss who was too strong you get better equipment level a bit then try again.

Later on it can often give the feeling of oh its too late to join the game everyone is already way ahead and will take me years to catch upThat being said I think ESO is not slow enough to cause the second point I made but slow enough to cause the first.

346169,0,t1_cfgmxej,This is even more impressive when you see how easy it is to overcharge any stat on your character. It is just wasteful to pick breton  light armor for healing for the endgame. Diversify your abilities and eliminate your weaknesses instead of minmaxing your char. ESO is quite different in gameplay to e.g. WoW Tanks have to be damage dealers to be useful and just have to survive some hard hitting mobs in an instance. With a good healer and competent DDs a tank is outright a wasted slot in a dungeon group. So when you maxed out survivability on your tank char youre pretty worthless for the group since youre just a mana hog for the healer and dont contribute any damage or anything else. DDs must be able to facetank enemies when needed and even survive one hit from a boss with a cooldown since the tank just cant hold every mob  of the time hitting him. Trash mobs just need raw damage and occasionally some CC. So a DD cant just play glass cannon with maxed out DPS he must ensure surviving at least trash mobs and  CC ability is nice to have. Healers are in the worst situation since healing itself generates to most aggro by far. In an average pick up goup when you pull a group of  enemies at least  of the mobs will outright attack the healer when he starts healing. When shit hits the fan in a hard fight and you have to crank out healing spells you end up tanking everything while healing everyone. This is why I plan my healer with heavy armor from the start. A maxed out pure healer with a spellpowernegligee as armor will crank out more heals but just die after seconds. So its actually highly inefficient to just max out your primary stat healtharmor DPS Magickaregeneration for your role a hybrid approach is just better in real gameplay but not on the spreadsheets.,elderscrollsonline,cfgndrr,2,t5_2tqi0

348989,0,t3_1y2l8n,While Ive liked the system to be able to craft in some MMOs its more or less the only worthwhile thing to craft at endgame our own bags but I see some issues to this in ESO.First off The system in ESO does not use bags in its classical sense but rather a inventory. Bags could increase overall inventory space of course but specific bags might be harder you could argue we already have that with the subcategory system of the ESO inventory materials being one category you can use.Second off I can not say this for sure but I would think that their decision to make inventory space both personal mount and bank space cost gold to increase is one of their goldsinks. We all know that MMO games need them to keep the economy healthy and all developers choose to make different things the goldsinks. ZOS seem to have chosen things like attributeskill point resets vampirewerewolf cure and inventory space to name the ones I know.Edit Doh just read uSolaAesirs post..

Theres a few melee yes but most are ranged.BethZeni is going to have to be careful with this stuff. If they make range to be too much of an advantage and between range and CC I think its quite possible and melee ends up second class citizens being CCd and kited to death the game will feel almost like an FPS and not in a good way.Hopefully they will keep their eye on game balance for that one and well see races even out a bit.,elderscrollsonline,cfhjmni,5,t5_2tqi0

395509,0,t3_1ykbjz,This is definitely something I do not like as well. There seems to be three main issues as mentioned by a lot of peopleIts insecure. Usernames are visible without the players consent.It breaks immersion for RPers. It doesnt allow people to play on a percharacter basis for privacy reasons Sometimes we just want to play an alt and not explain ourselves to anyone or be rude. And that also ties into the second issue.So I propose the following solutionsTo address security Allow players to choose a unique player account nickname separate from the username thats used for logging in. Adding someone to ignore would show CharacterX accountwideTo address RP Guild chat should always show the character name you are logged in with. A toggle choice can be set for someone to choose to display their account nickname at all times.To address character privacy Players can be added by character name or account name. If they trust you as a friend and wish for you to find them on any alt they can simply give their account nickname to you instead. Guilds would still be account wide but you must join each character individually in the UI which you could do at any time once you are already in the guild with one character already. You would show as offline with no information showing when not logged into a character that has opted in with that guild. There could also be a toggle in the Guild UI to just display your account nickname and auto display any character you are logged into for the people that want convenience and dont care about character privacy.These are just my thoughts and thanks for reading.

396474,0,t1_cflupfz,Cant agree with that argument. Just because something is great it doesnt mean it is easy or obvious to reproduce.For instance we all know WoW had  mil subs. Has any other MMO come even close in over  years since then? Nope. But why not? Its obviously good. And we had tons of WoW clones did we not? Well actually we did not.So if it were good more devs would do it is not a valid argument. WoW was good. Indisputably so. So far NOBODY has managed to make even a semidecent attempt at ripping it off and replicating its success. Wildstar will probably be the first one to even approach a true WoWclone. And even that is imperfect in too many ways.Though I do agree this is not perfect for everyone. Some like  minute daynight cycles. Just not me. Which is why it can be optional. Further since this is a phased megaserver people with various options enabled could be grouped together. So people like me on  hr clock would be grouped with others like me on the same  hr clock. And people who enjoy  min clocks can group with each other. Same as you enable the RP flag in options and get grouped with other RPers.,elderscrollsonline,cfluznt,1,t5_2tqi0

Also because of the attractiveness of he class  archtype a lot of them end up getting played be players which show a little gap between confidence and actual skill and therefore mst groups try to avaoid these characters when it comes to make running a dungeon.Thanks to zenimax the class is not limiting you in your decision of how you want to play your charactr if you fiddle around with heavy armor and a shield and sword you will definitly end up haveing fun with tanking also as a nightblade. restostaff also neat weapon choice.And regarding PvP what is wrong with killing reinforcements on the way to the keep your army lays siege on? Oh as a singletarget dps i am not suited for big chaotic teamfightssieges  whats the news?Nightblades can do Aoe damage picking up class skills from siphoning wearing h or hshield. i also think even when being skilled as an asassin type fighter a bow in a siege is always a good weapon choice...just comparing the class skills nightblades offer the same amount of interesting ways to build them as other classes do... maybe there is something aside from teleport strike and eviscerate  oh wait that was something else ... oh right remember that one? ,elderscrollsonline,cfmpalg,0,t5_2tqi0

427296,0,t3_1yywfx,Well for class Id suggest sorcerer. Note that you can be a stealthy archer on any class your not forced into nightblade. Sorcerer is arguably the top ranged dps class so its a good fit. Id also look at Templar because they have fantastic class abilities like binding javelin and sunfire to compliment a ranged build. Dragon knight and nightblade are better suited for melee tankdps.For race dont go bosmer they suck. Ignore the bow exp it wont matter later. Go for Altmer Breton or dunmer or kajit just not bosmer.Theres a hnd and shield skill line so you will use that as your secondary loadout. As for bow skills Id recommend venom arrow and magnum shot. The others are bad. Snipe is useable as a stealth opener but its useless out of stealth so its a trade off. Weapon abilities are generally bad compared to class abilities so use those  bow skills at most and fill in with class abilities. Guild? U mean fighter or Mage? In the game you will align with all the guilds and do all their quests its not a big deal. If you meant social guild then search recruitment threads on fan site forums.,elderscrollsonline,cfp1yxs,1,t5_2tqi0

The last time i tried i just logged in ran around for  min in Orgrimmar and realized WoW is not the game i want to play.

Just like everything else balancing and viability is a give and take relationship you want to be good at this then you sacrifice in another area ala if you put all your points into magicka then obviously your stamina is going to suffer.The truth is this is a multiplayer game with the trinity model.  there are baseline expectations on what EACH player has to perform if they want to do challenging group content end of story.  Yes sad to say it but you will be pidgeon holed into doing a specific role and specific functions in the group and with that comes viability. If your buildspec or whatever cannot sustain or perform that function to a desired level of result of your peers then you are not viable.  Thats all.,elderscrollsonline,cfqwjz3,1,t5_2tqi0

456543,0,t3_1za1ud,No I have a few reasons why ESO has not appealed to me yet. It interests me but does not deliver the compelling feeling that I need to continue playing this game.  First reason is assuming all the bugs are fixed all of the quests have been relatively boring. Not even the main quest is interesting and that practically follows the main goal of your character. In the beta half the quests were broken and the spawn times were absurdly long. Hopefully they fix some of the practical issues issues but there were a lot of gamebreaking bugs that wouldnt allow my friends and I to progress at all because the quests just wouldnt work. I feel like I am not actually deciding on anything that everything is being decided for me. There doesnt seem to be any selfdriven quests or choices that actually make a difference. None of the quests were even rewarding as the gold given would barely be enough to buy a sword from a local merchant even if you pooled all of your earnings from every quest in the area and sold everything you get.  Secondly my friends and I had major issues with connecting to each other so that we could quest together. Half of the time the shards wouldnt allow us to connect together at all leaving one of our friends out of the party. There were multitudes of connection issues. In this game where companionship is one of the major buying points that cannot be allowed to pass. Lastly it simply isnt worth the expensive price point that it boasts. Sure the graphics are good and its a cooperative TES game but I havent seen anything that makes it more unique or more attractive than other games to be released just this month. ESO boasts a high price point in which it fails to make a strong argument for anyone who isnt already a fan of the series. As someone who loves TES and all content that is released with the name TES on it I sincerely hope that Zenimax adds or releases content that will make the game worthwhile. One of my biggest concerns is that Zenimax wont fix all the bugs that have made the beta absolutely dreadful. ESO still has potential and I remain hopeful for it but I wont be buying it until it proves to be more than what it currently is. ,elderscrollsonline,cfs5paj,6,t5_2tqi0

468685,0,t1_cfthsof,gtIt really isnt the developers fault that you couldnt figure out the colour scheme for which quest was your active quest it was a pretty simple concept.Having seven identical arrows on your compass all overlapping each other is difficult to navigate no matter what colors you make them.gt I have yet to see any Kill  Boars type quests which are the typical quests in other MMOs so unless you are saying that the Kill  X quests are super interesting and nonlinear I dont see how the quests in this game are bland and linear compared to other MMO quests.Every quest I completed was Run at your slowasfuck pace to Place and talk to Person maybe fight a thing if youre lucky. Id say that gets bland and linear after the first two or three times you do it.gt There are special moves that can be interrupted power moves that can be blocked both of which leave your opponent vulnerable to a counter attack. Compare that to right click on target press  and  until target is dead of other MMOs referring to PvE play as PvP is vastly different in both styles of combat and presumably not what you are referencing and I ont see how you can complain about the combat.One thing I got very good at this weekend was left clicking as fast as possible and spamming the numbers . Its just as much mashing as any other MMO. I also continued to be stabbed with no enemies around even continuing to be hit after I entered buildings. It felt unnatural it felt clunky it felt poorly put together. My hits wouldnt register my special moves only worked  of the time and I never blockedinterrupted anything despite mashing the mouse buttons and changing my control scheme to cut out the possibility that I might me misclicking LRmouse to interrupt. The combat was to me broken.gt Again not the fault of the developers that you didnt do any dungeons or group up with a nearby player to take down a tough mob or portal.I played with a group of friends and all agreed that splitting up would make the experience less disappointing. Questing in groups did nothing but clutter the screen and make everything more difficult.gt The Beta this weekend was a stress test not a content test the content of this weekends beta was from  one month ago and many other things have been addedupgradedimproved since then but wasnt live in this weekends test.This game hits the consumer market next month.

473500,0,t3_1zj41y,. The different types or armor gives you different benefits through their passives. Light is mainly magicka regen more dmg with spells and that sort. Medium armor is more focused on stamina based attacking. And Heavy armor is about tanking and mitigating damage. Any role can use any armor but you need to look at the different benefits of the different types to find a good balance. A good place to start is . All classes can perform every role successfully and this is not something Im just saying its true. But if youre looking for classes fitting the normal concepts of their role Id say DK for takning templar for healing sorc for ranged and nightblade for melee. But its not like either class has any role they cant fit with the right setup of skills and equipment.. You can reset skill points or attribute points for a scaling gold cost. This was not yet in the Beta but youll be able to do it at altars in the zones major cities. Although youll have enough skillpoints to allow specializing in both healing and h combat at the same time just swap around gear and abilities.. They are used for crafting. Different traits that you can give weapons and armors use different materials like rubies and emeralds. And yes you have to destroy a weapon with the right trait wait until research is done and then craft it.. You get the option to buy the standard imperial horse for g instead of having to spend .k on a normal one. You can do so right as you leave coldharbour..

475919,0,t1_cfuanui,I didnt say creating addons. Using addons however is using a mechanism that has been put into the game by the designers just as they have put potions in to give you an ingame advantage.You dont have to be an addon developer to use them you can just go and grab them.By the way you hit upon a lua addon before you even see your first potion ingame. Thats because the login screen already is a lua code running. Cant share it but if you ever happen to come upon it its in the pregameaccountlogin folder structure.You cant really manipulate the API you can only use it. But thats a minor nitpick on technical terms. I personally wouldnt mind if they limited the GetUnitBuffInfo call to NPC or players from your own faction. There might be one or two more api functions that could merit a closer look but sadly as soon as one outs himself as actually knowing a thing or two about what is really there or not there come some people finger pointing and screaming cheater who clearly dont want to have a honest discussion worth having.,elderscrollsonline,cfud52c,1,t5_2tqi0

Im a sorcerer tank while shes a dragon knight H heavy DPS with heals on the side. Once we hit zone  not even the two of us could beat any of the overland bosses and in Coldharbour we only beat one or two due to some major cheesing after at least  wipes. Quests can be fairly difficult as well but those have to be at least somewhat scaled back so most people of varying builds can have a chance but a group of  or more enemies kicking your butt while youre trying to fight a boss and youll wipe so quick it hurts.

483189,0,t1_cfuyheu,Thats not nearly as bad. Its respectable at least but v was still a really shitty bracket where the composition and overall strength of the class really seemed to seal the deal. I think things really got better when Blizzard finally admitted that it was impossible to balance for v gimped the bracket and focused on the larger brackets for balancing.Also I dont know if the arena was directly responsible for these issues in PvE youre talking about. Blizzards always had a hamfisted way of balancing things and I dont think that would have stopped even if the arena hadnt existed. Classes seemed to fall in and out of favor all the time as the cyclical nature of Blizzards balancing methods. Rogues in particular always seemed to fluctuate between periods where they were out of favor and periods where suddenly half of the DPS of every competitive raid were rogues. Im not denying that arena balance affected the balance of PvE as well but I think that this disparity would have happened anyways.,elderscrollsonline,cfv6x3c,1,t5_2tqi0

If this were the case the API would not be available for people to play with. Every MMO starts out in a vanilla state this does not mean that anything outside of what was designed was also unintended. Its the ingenuity of the playerbase that creates these additional tools and allows for different experiences within the game proper. In a way you could consider that emergent gameplay. If the developers provide the tools and environment the players can make of it what they will. If Zenimax doesnt want that to happen they have the ability to stop it.gt No? I imagined not.Answering questions for me now it seems. I dont believe that it cheapens or degrades the experience even in the case you stated. No addon in the world can make you a good player no matter how much you seem to think this is the case. I could mouse over you all day but if Im not in range or have the resources to use my interrupt or are affected by something that might prevent me from using that interrupt the addon in your example becomes useless.

If you purchase the imperial edition you can create an imperial character.Theyd have to send out the keys before early access so people with the IE can make Imperials during early access Wrong. Dont take this the wrong way but you among others are the reason forums are full with wrong information.

505205,0,t1_cfxodb8,gt but if you look at the greater media outlets ESO is actually getting a lot of positive press especially as these heavily requested changes like skipping tutorial island creature collision animation updates keep coming out.Currently theres nothing on the following websites pertaining to any of the recent updates IGN UP Gamespot Giant Bomb MassivelyNot only that but some of these sites havent updated news on ESO in months. The only website that I noticed had any coverage of the latest updates was MMORPG.com and even that news story was buried in the UI. Meaning you wont see it if youre not actively looking for it. If there is positive news circulating it must be coming from somewhere else because its not apparent from the larger gaming outlets. Im forced to wonder how much of the target audience its reaching in this case. NeoGAF and v certainly arent particularly friendly towards the game either. That brings us back to Reddit to round out the top gaming aggregates and we already know the general consensus around here. Thats why I feel Zenimax could really benefit from some heavy marketing leading up to release because it really needs it.,elderscrollsonline,cfxp0w2,6,t5_2tqi0

508225,0,t3_1zy3rp,Per ESO Support the early access code you receive after pre ordering a physical game is basically only proof of your pre order. Once you receive the actual package there will be a game key inside. You need both for early access.If you pre ordered from a retailer where you can pick up your physical game you may be in a better spot than others who pre ordered from some place like Amazon like me unfortunately. We will have to wait on delivery once the product is available. I was really depressed when I found this out because March   day early access is a Sunday.Anyone in my boat will be keeping their fingers crossed that the package arrives on Sat. the th. Otherwise we will miss the first day at least. Of course that wont stop me from trying to get in without the game key if I dont receive the package on time You really cant fault BethZeni for this though.

In beta for Guild Wars  I used a bug on my Thief to blink up to an enemy on a wall to get inside the center keep and it was very telling as to why that feature shouldnt be thrown in without some stipulations. Apart from how annoying it is as a defender even if it doesnt really give the attacking side an advantage overall as someone who is organizing an attack you see your groups break down and your class selection shift towards one or two classes since everyone wants to be sneaky but only ends up feeding the other side kills.Sure I can say that its about choices but it gets ridiculous pretty fast.

537371,0,t1_cg1bt18,In that sense the RvR zones in DAoC were instanced because there were multiple servers. Hell every game that has multiples servers at all is effectively completely instanced by that definition.Its also hard to compare the reset time of Cyrodiil to any other games BGs. Your Alterac Valley instance lasted  hours which would be . of the time it would take Cyrodiil to reset. Three months is long enough to develop specific feuds with enemy playersguilds and such. I only played WoW for  weeks at launch but I guess its cool that BGs even lasted that long. Its just not the same though. And all my experiences with BGs in other games involve  minute fights that just got repeated verbatim.Hopefully you find enough content and objectives in Cyrodiil to not get so bored.

I play on console and console alone dont touch mods and love the immersive elements of the Elder Scrolls games. And I play exclusively in first person so it was very difficult for me to get a good sense of how I might enjoy ESO even after the NDA was lifted.Until the NDAlift Ive been leaning negative toward the game. Too WoWlike it seemed. Running the risk of becoming a gearoriented grinder. Raids for gear. PvP for gear. What about the immersion?From what it looks like the FEEL of the game is righton. That makes me really happy.Ive also been reading and watching more on the crafting system. And I LOVE THIS. Great concept. Hopefully theres unique craftonly gear too.

Both genders were the same height for all three so it seems to be the case unless any of the other races behave differently that the female heights maintain the same ratios and precise heights as their male counterparts.In other words if you did have a female Altmer and a male Dunmer for them to be the same height the Altmer would need to be the shortest possible and the Dunmer towards the upperend of the available height range.,elderscrollsonline,cg3gc7k,10,t5_2tqi0

With more people in the same phase its far harder to get everyone to leave an area andor relog at the same time so there will always be someone in that phase for whom it is borked. So then people come back and are put back in that phase and it remains borked. Rinse and repeat.Thats my most logical guess though.

They kicked themselfs in their own balls with the heavily bugged beta already. I doubt they will offer anything that is gamebreaking from the shop.From my point of view nothing has changed. I preordered the IE to get  days ahead  the exp bonus from the rings. I couldnt care less about the horse or the mudcrab as I just want as much exp advantage I can get over other people. Sure you level faster with a horse because you are cutting down the downtimes between quests but besides that a horse isnt offering you much more. You can buy a horse easily at aroun dlevel  I think as there isnt really much else you can spend gold on besides respeccing. Also imo that horse is for the people that want a level one horse but dont want to upgrade their account to IE because they dont care for the rings etc. Thats my point of view.

However I think on classroll you should have the option to pick more than one for us hodgepodge folk.Personally Im going with Bosmer Templar main wep set duel wieldmedium armor secondary set bow. I rolled a guy like that this weekend and it was AMAZING! The Duel Wield morphs can provide self heals and the templar get a lot of snaresinterrupts which works really well for bow kiting.Later in the game I might rely more on a resto staff in groups but honestly I didnt need any light armorstaff to keep my groups up during dungeon crawls. I got magika back from the armor I crafted self healing from procs and easily kept the MT up by only using magika for healing. Of course sometimes it was better to use bow from a distance especially for kiting!Hard to define myself with just that poll but people complaining about templars are wrong that class is so much fun!,elderscrollsonline,cg4u4ft,1,t5_2tqi0

573764,0,t1_cg5h2hh,gt When I played the PvE aspect of the game in the newly opened area for AD I encountered a landscape with lots and lots of cliffs and walls that seemed to artificially segment an area that in itself is connected to other areas only by a few roads with unclimbable obstacles along the rest of the border.Same thing happens in Skyrim. Try walking north from Markarth. You cant because the landscape is filled with lots and lots of cliffs and walls.gtAfter x metres the mobs will turn back. You can kite them but not very far. This way the game designer has control over who fights what.Same thing happens in Skyrim. Dragon attack? Run it off it will reset. Try kiting any of the named dragons to the gates of Stormwind and see how far they chase you.gtIn TESO... youd rarely stumble across two more quests that were completely unrelated to the first while on your way there.Were we even playing the same game? The mages guild quest for example sends you to from Ebenhart to Mournhold a journey that you have to walk since unlike skyrim there is no carriage. During the walk from Ebenhart to Mournhold you pass no less then  questgivers on the road. .I leveled two characters through the Ebenhart Pact and did not do the same two quests twice.

Stuff like hair clothing that isnt part of the base mesh etc. is still just barely coming out.You also have the issue that while mesh detail is solved with tesselation there isnt anything equivalent for textures yet and almost all games have textures that will look terrible if you get close enough to the surface.Animation and player control of smooth and complex animation is also pretty early yet with games like Assassins Creed just scratching the surface of what can be done and animation honestly is one of the big things that holds games back from being a lot more realistic looking in motion.Theres tons of room in technical achievement in terms of making games look and play much better than they do now.,elderscrollsonline,cg6bc9u,1,t5_2tqi0

After that you have to provide people content EVERY month to justify them spending  bucks a month.This is how all companies should think. I am not saying Carbine will pull it off but it is how everyone should expect companies to behaveupdate.The fact that Blizzard is STILL not putting out content and are still on SoO is disgusting.

So this is actually an enormous advantage for me almost as enormous as the insurmountable advantage any player who wants more combat information has over any player who actually wants less.Still Id much rather the game was actually launching with a UI that had a chance of allowing the core game to reach its potential and provide a level playing field that didnt achieve balance by turning every outcome into RNG.Unless ZOS has some supersecret bug free megaUI patch up their sleeves the ideal solution is to simply revert the changes minus whatever player information people are worried might reveal their actual gameplay in PVP for whatever reason that I still cant fathom.,elderscrollsonline,cg78zsf,28,t5_2tqi0

592094,0,t3_20x73q,Hi and thanks for coming to answer some questions.I have two questionsfirstly I was wondering how much testing will go into the actual European servers before you move us over down the line or can we expect to be hit by a week or so of performance issues when we get moved over.Secondly I have been seeing a lot in regards to that nightblades arent worth taking to a dungeon over other classes wether this is true or not is questionable But how do you currently see class balancing. Are you happy with one class trumping all others in aoe but being the worst at single target etc or are you making sure the weapon skills are powerful enough this is kind of nullified?

However it does satisfies almost all my needs for MMOs so Id give it a  but someone who wants WoW in terms of highly numerical interface with the recent API changes might give it a  and itd be a legitimate opinion for him since they claim it makes the game unplayable for them.

Theres also  points waiting for me in Cyrodiil and I plan to group farm for all of them by level . Those  points are good for  points in each profession provided you supplement with  points from PvE content.Also I dont plan to put any points into PvP skills so that frees up more for weapons and class abilities. I plan to focus on being a good tank and healer with the emphasis on tanking for a while Ive played tank in WoW Rift SWTOR... I dig it and it does not take too many points to build a decent tank. Here is a Templar tanking buildout at level  which shows that leveling profs is not that difficult if you choose wisely. Along with the  Skill Points from Cyrodiil I think you have even more than  points at  provided you do all the quests and find all the Skyshards up to the  zone.When I was  in the beta I respecced my character and even after spending all the points I had I still had a few left over and I had not even gotten Skill Points from Cyrodiil.

Warriors of sand and stone have come alive strange beasts prowl the forests and atronachs run amok. The Herald begged me to aid Craglorn against these threats.

636980,0,t1_cgcmjhv,Of course my experience is pretty early on but i ran three of the relatively early dungeons level  and really enjoyed them. They feel appropriately challenging at their respective levels and i remember two of the bosses wiped us a couple times in a pickup group. The standard equivalent of a WoW man dungeon is a man so presumably tankhealer dps but I had the chance to join  people in sort of a world event as well and that was fun not too challenging at that level but I imagine it would be more challenging later on.One thing I would say is this. Its been a couple years since I was a part of the WoW community but I know that when I did play a large part of the game was grinding for the gear or the reputation or the level that you could show off. Elder scrolls so far feels like its not as oriented towards gear as a status symbol. That said theres no shortage of things you can do to distinguish yourself as a player but rather than grind a boss repeatedly for a drop it seems like youre getting your items through crafting chests and random world drops.I guess the way Id summarize it is this. I loved everything about WoW I loved raiding and group pvp etc and I loved grinding for status symbols. But now that Im not a teenager with all the time in the world to play I personally was looking for a game in which the journey to the end itself would be the enjoyment. I cant really say what the endgame is gonna be like but I can say levelling and exploring so far has been a blast and if the quality of game play and depth of the world can speak to what theyre gonna do in the future Im optimistic.  ,elderscrollsonline,cgcob8a,1,t5_2tqi0

In an MMO most people dont have a problem with that but by having the focus be one person you arent forced to play in a group.  I dont think that would fit in very well with ESOs vision of play how you want.    ,elderscrollsonline,cgd0cpr,1,t5_2tqi0

648838,0,t3_21kblk,So heres a question...My wife amp I both preordered the Imperial Edition. Well each get a Rings of Mara set. From what I understand if we both make characters and use her set we can get the bonus experience on just those two characters. If we make alts can I use my set to give THOSE characters the bonus? If I dont make an alt but use my set on another friend who plays then wear both rings do they each get the normal bonus while I get double the bonus? Would I only get the normal bonus?Can you go through the ritual with your own set after going through with someone elses set and if so would doing so chain the sets or cancel the first set?Personally I really wish it was an accountwide thing. My wife amp I play games together regularly and to only be able to do the ritual on one character maybe two? means itll take our second alts were already planning on a main in DC and an alt in each of the other factions longer since we wont have the bonus.

The system requires COD cash on delivery meaning mail wont release the item unless they pay whatever gold amount you type in the COD box.  Youll receive the gold they pay via mail once the process is complete.  During beta it was only a min or two before I got gold for items I sold by mail.  You dont even have to be close in proximity to do this they can be far away which I like because then it doesnt interrupt my game play too much.  If I remember right though there was a postal charge tax or processing fee of sorts thats some age of the transaction total.  I feel like it was maybe g for an g transaction I made.   Maybe theres a way to trade for free by holding the interaction button while close to someone I dont know thoughI never played with anyone during beta. ,elderscrollsonline,cgez0c3,2,t5_2tqi0

679135,0,t3_1rhjo9,While ESO may not have open world pvp the RvR zone cyd isnt all about taking keeps.  I am sure most of you dont even realize there are tons of quests skyshards and dungeons in the RvR zone.  You wouldnt know it because they do not have map icons.  There are quests that send you into the dungeons to kill the boss  or just quests that send you around the zone.  I am not talking about the quests you get from the bounty boards.  These are found by exploring the zone.  Hint Find a map of skyshards and start grabbing them you will run into these quests.The cool thing about this is that while doing these dungeons ive encountered more groupsolo pvp than I could ask for.  Someone is always in the dungeons so there is always someone or something to kill.Each faction has  skyshards on their side of the RvR map with them are dungeons and tons of quests.  Any faction can grab all the skyshards so its just a matter of traveling around.  While its not open world pvp it is something.  I do find it terrible that so many games dont have it anymore it makes WoWs open world pvp look good.  That to me is sad.  WoW pvp was atrocious and it hurt the MMO market by spawning so many copy cat MMOs with watered down pvp.  WoW is the MMO that ruined mmos not something that should be celebrated.To me the last game that did open world pvp right was AION at release.  You could go to the other sides pve realm but had to spawn a kisk. If you died youd respawn at kisk until it was destroyed by enemy players.  So if they wanted you gone they had to find your kisk.  Worked great and was really fun.  No kisk meant you respawned back at home and had to wait for a portalwhich was quite a wait at times.,elderscrollsonline,cghgv58,1,t5_2tqi0

Its a digital age itd be a bit silly of them to still only be working off of boxed sales.

I will aggro mobs and drag them on to you so they break your attempt to pick I will save my sprint so when I approach you picking the chest I can burst away and transfer the aggro. Once this is complete I will steal the chest while you assume the aggro and take the goods. .I will try to initiate a trade with you in order to give you a message notification which will take you off your chest attempt I will then cancel fast and take the chest lock pick attempt. . I will span E while your opening the chest in hopes you fail your attempt so I can sneak in their and take what was yours. . I will continue to spam E in hopes that your inventory is full and I can snipe the loot because you have no space in your bag.the beauty of . is that even if they do loot the chest atleast  of the time they are dieing shortly after or while acquiring the loot. At the rate of  trash in chests the repair bill outweighs the value of the contents inside the chests. So either way you lose.,elderscrollsonline,cgkgxk4,-7,t5_2tqi0

One notable exception exiting Fort Virak.

There are also public dungeons you dont need a group to enter them and you do them with random other people who are also in the dungeon. Usually see maybe  people at different stages of the dungeon at any one time.. I personally play a nightblade ranger and really enjoy it. Any class can use any weapon and perform admirably with it. So experiment and see what you like the best. I know there is a strong build Ive seen that is a templar archer.. Sure. There are zergs but there are also a lot of small objectives both pve and pvp.

Making the fight a challenge as it should be. Ensuring that many people can all get contribution for fighting the boss.

Running it better is physically not possible. ,elderscrollsonline,cgsusz6,1,t5_2tqi0
779298,0,t1_cgs95aq,As a player who got to Vet after doing about  of all possible content till then I just cant help but think that people are exaggerating the amount of bugs. I can admit that the end of Coldharbor bugging was frustrating and Zenimax shouldve done all in their power to do a temp fix like sending GMs immediately to fix the issue or reset objective or something. But besides that out of the approximately  quests of Ebonheart I have honestly had  quests per zone bug out so that they cant be completed until server reset. Thats ridicilously low amount in my opinion. Yes quests shouldnt bug at all but seriously tho. That or even a bit higher amount of bugging quests doesnt impaire your progress at all when it comes to leveling. I could go on and on about other aspects of the game that vocal minority is constantly whining about but that just makes for a way too long of a post. To answer the original post yes I am gonna pay for the subscription as of now. Bugs are so few they dont even hinder my experience with the game the content is plenty as questing and general PvE without grinding seems to take atleast h in order to complete content on one character  and if you dont care for the story content well I guess you can grind pretty effectivelyCrafting is important aspect to me in MMOs and in ESO it has been enjoyable since the start. PvP seems like a blast at its best and dungeons so far have been fun and I cant wait to get to the end game to experience adventure zones.Quests are generally good well paced and and interesting if you listen to the NPCs. Main story is twoedged sword. It does nothing special in terms of storytelling and is very predictable. But I think in MMO standards its all very well put together. I think Im forgetting something but yeah I enjoy everything. Even the limited bank space it is part of their planned economy and yeah it takes some time to manage your inventory but again I have had no problems with space. Yeah I have bought like  bank upgrades  inventory slot upgrades and fed my horse only to raise inventory space and being enchanter  woodworker  clother I still can keep all mats needed  some other stuff and equipment to be researched. And I have spent like k only to get enchanting as high as possible as fast as possible. For me the only things to spend money on are bank upgrades mount equipment repair and some crafting stuff and some impulse buys like motifs and few random good and cheap items. I have not ran out of money at any point Ive gotten everything I needed.If you are guy who is willing to pay k for vampire bite then come here bitching about inventory slots and such... Well all hope is lost. TLDR I like everything almost to the point being weird goldbugsinventory slots are no problem if you really put some effort in to it and I typed this all on mobile I consider myself a hero. ,elderscrollsonline,cgsuz5o,4,t5_2tqi0

787276,0,t1_cgtpovp,Same here just cancelled. For me the game feels to much like a user made MMO addon to a single player game. You can see a lot of ambition some whacky ideas that never should have made it out of a planning meeting but that survive when you got a hobby developer working on a project.To me the difference between a solo story instance how smooth the game is then how well it responds is  a stark contrast when you are out and about with other players around.mini rollbacks where you are just thrown out of the game and when you log back in you are in another zone and the last few minutes havent happened. Unable to fight because the game suddenly stops responding to fight actions you can still move and do other things most of them being dying from the mob that just attacked you.Individual skills just plain not working when they fire. Individual skills not firing until you hammer the key.Enemies continuing to fight when they should be dead then dying seconds to late.When the game works it is a lot of fun but these moments of fun are completely ruined by the absolute certainty that you will be encountering a bug sooner or later.Right now the game is like eating a taste morsel of food you know has glass shards in it that are going to cut your tongue. It is tasty enough but the knowledge it is is going to hurt sooner or later kinda distracts from the taste.,elderscrollsonline,cgtrms8,13,t5_2tqi0

In gw some asswipe took it literary milliseconds before me because I logged in right when servers went live. Heh...

And the game is also great if you are super fast or you just happen to have alot of time on your hand just took a brake for  days and spent sometime with friends and such but I already put around  days played into the game. most of the time during early access and the following week.Its great because you have an instances or two not  or  which are overcrowded with people which is the main cause of the real gamebreaking bugs aka progression quests that bugged out because to many people where in the same instances. Yes there are other bugs but they are minor compared to the fact that there are bugs in the game hence imo come from the phasing which just brake the game for the majority of the people.Dont get me wrong I love every tiny bit of the game. Ive had three or four bugged quests due to the quest being buggy and not the phasing in my entire playtime. Some worldboss mechanics were a little bit odd or to rng to be intended but other than that Ive not had any troubles. It was just a realistic viewpoint. There is no need to be overly pessimistic or optimistic. They fucked up big times but they still have some goodies on their backhand and if they are able to fix the issue that is causing all the quests to bug out whene there are to many people this game may actually do pretty well. Though it will still get alot of hate but thats buisness as usual ,elderscrollsonline,cgurtn8,2,t5_2tqi0

797359,0,t1_cguvwxf,I totally second this post. The ingame the community is pretty awesome. Zone chat will be zone chat but more often than not if you ask a reasonable question youll usually get a few answers from some kind folks wanting to help out.There are a lot of complaining posts in this subreddit and Im guessing the reason behind that is because right after launch ZOS was personally responding to a lot of Help Ive been wronged! threads. They have also been listening heavily to the communities reactions both positive and negative in the game. Its helped the game coming very far in a short amount of time.I do think its overkill when last night I came on and there were three or four topics about the bank bug. They acknowledged its a thing in the official patch notes they said they are looking into a fix for those who have been wronged but that it will take time. I realize its frustrating but flooding the subreddit isnt going to make things go any faster. ,elderscrollsonline,cguwvhx,7,t5_2tqi0
797556,0,t1_cguvp2c,Okay! Im at work so I couldnt have a massive look for you yet Right if you take a look at this link here You can see a list of popular cards and how they perform at p at Ultra settings. You said you would like to stay around  FPS so I took a look at some of the cards there.All the cards that will keep the game running at fps  p assuming your playing in p are sadly out of your given budget I did find a nice deal on a ti  This card still has more power than an Xbox OnePS and will keep your game running at an average of about  fps. These are GREAT due to their small size Can fit in almost any shop brought PC from Dell HP ect They Usually require no PCI cables for power  hence it only needs  watts to run. Leaving you with plenty of headroom there For a decent gb model you are looking at exactly  If it was me and the budget wasnt at all flexible  I would grab one of those throw it in the system drop down maybe shadows one notch to high graphics instead of ultra to gain another few FPS and go from there! The EVGA model I linked may need a bit more power than the reference but for the price it may be just what your looking for. Evga are also amazing on customer service.Sorry for poor formatting and rushed reply  I will have another look when I get in and give you a few more suggestions.,elderscrollsonline,cguxoiy,2,t5_2tqi0

804098,0,t3_23cjv2,If the most damaging items are the veteran motifs and veteran crafting materials just completely remove those items from the game and unlearn the motifs from everyone. Then you need to have a debate on whether to yank the veteran level armor off everyone and out of their inventories. I would argue that you should remove everything not actively being worn and drop everything being worn to blue or green level.Then again Ive been playing since early access and my highest character just hit level  so what the fuck do I care how bad they rape the high level people.

804459,0,t1_cgvpm0v,gt The thing is the problems they have encountered are not unique or unexpected and could easily have been predicted based on the previous performance of earlier MMOs.I can tell you right now as a programmer that this is quite false. On the surface where the end result is seen may not look unique but internally it is almost always a different story. A professor will teach you on day one that it is  developing and  problem solving.Computer code is extremely picky and those who run into fewer problems are the fortunate not the other way around because what would appear to be at a glance in working order ends up really being a systematic nightmare. Students at my old tech school are given homework specifically to help them develop their skills in creative troubleshooting because logic does not work how you think it would.So the next patch Zenimax releases think about this when they broke more than they fixed because again logic and code often does not work how you think it would or should.

Entertainment is the key.  If youre not having fun dont play.But in conjunction with that.  Dont freak out.  Its not that it shouldnt be better or that some of these things arent annoying or bad.  or stupid or poorly done.  Its that... it is what it is.  Its temporary.  And its common.  hence  perspective.   dont get too worked up.

810458,0,t3_23etyx,I agree with the OP as much promise as Eso has and some very strong points as well Zenimaxx is dropping the ball big time on some rather important aspects. Communication at the very top timely bugfixes right after that and game polish would come third for me.To elaborate  communication fails too often on their front. One example is the bank bug where the ambiguously worded statement this fix will not be retroactive led many people to cry murder because they thought theyd get no recompensation for lost items  slots. I have been hit by the bank bug four times myself and would welcome at least a statement telling me how much longer I have to make do with the meagre  bankslots I currently have.Communication from the customer support needs a lot of improvement as well. While people may initially have smiled getting back replies with references to wizards at work and what not it gets old really fast when you dont get a decent answer as to what the problem is if they are aware of it and an eta for a fix. Overall customer support appears friendly but woefully incompetent.The next bugfixes. Too many quests are still bugged and the case of the AD main quest being bugged and thus being a showstopper for people trying to progress is a real nogo. Then the duping bug being reported in february and ignored until now  words fail me.Finally game polish. Zenimaxx appears to have been very lazy especially when it comes to UI polish relying on the community to take care of it with addons. The auction house UI is atrocious to say it nicely. Then the ridiculous bank tetris you have to play if you want to craft. I have easily spent  of my playtime so far shifting bank contents around since I happen to enjoy crafting and want to do all  crafts there are. Even if I would do less crafting Id still have to juggle bank contents around and that is zero fun at all adds no value whatsoever to my gameplay and makes me actually wonder why I left guildwars.All in all I still like this game and want to keep playing it but my patience is really running thin by now.

Even if they were attempting small fixes before now it obviously wasnt enough. They should have disabled the guild banks long ago.Now that theyre just now getting around to dealing with the problem instead of actually looking at individuals and banning in an orderly fashion they just deactivated scores of accounts and decided to look into them one by one as the complaints piled up. Thats not the sign of a company that knows what theyre doing as far as customer service is concerned.

819649,0,t3_23ijj8,I agree the PvP is horrible. There is no PvP its retarded zerg vs retarded zerg. You basically just aim towards a mosh pit of like  players and push some buttons to see what lands. The outcome?....Well you got a  chance its either group A kills group B or group B kills group A. And the game rolls on rinse repeat rinse repeat.This is not PvP and anyone who likes this kind of game play I guarantee is more in it for the RP for example they like feeling like its a war. Or they like the scenery...or the skyshards...or quests.But for people like me I could care less about the scenary and the story line behind why we are at war I just want to have some aggressive smart action packed PVP.I love having PvP apart of my MMO...I also love to PvE and even RP when the time is right..... but this is just an interactive cinematic.,elderscrollsonline,cgxg30d,1,t5_2tqi0

I am fine with the monthly fee I think it typically keeps content flowing and quality up but there are just too many issue for me right now.  I have had  bank rollback and the customer service has been really aweful I know they are overworked but man after spending K multiple times it gets old.

823896,0,t1_cgxc9ao,gtUnplayable is whatever causes a user to give up and leave.No it isnt. Unplayable is when you are lacking un the ability able to play. Calling a game unplayable when you simply dislike some aspect of it is childish. gtAnd you were wrong.How?  You claimed that three months after SWTOR launched they were down to k subscribers.  I correct you by saying they were . million subs during the counts in February and March. I provided many links supporting that number. What makes this even more embarassing for you is how you posted a link that talked about how they dropped to . million subs in May and how it was a k drop from the previous total. You provided a source that contradicted your own assertion.  Did you even read that eurogamer article?I also told you that k subscribers cannot be true because when SWTOR switched to the FP model they still had between  million and k subscribers.  I provided a link supporting that as well. And lets not pretend that assuming the minimum k subs means a game HAS to go FP because many games have stayed PP with far fewer subs.  EVE FFXI FFXIV...  The switch to FP was about FP being a more profitable payment model in the short term which is why many MMOs have taken that route right from their launch. SWTORs current success proves that.  Last year it made over  on the Cartel Market alone not counting subscribers. The game is certainly far from imploding at this point which is really all that matters.gt million free to play users is not the same thing as  million monthly subs.You are confused if you ever thought I was arguing that SWTOR had  million subscribers. You are arguing with straw men. gtTry and be objective and not a hardcore gamer fanboy for a minuteOh grow up. ,elderscrollsonline,cgxxg7y,1,t5_2tqi0

857152,0,t1_ch1me7c,I agree they are very similar. The main difference is that ESO has the illusion of being Sandboxy but after a while you begin to realize it is actually more themepark in design just like SWTOR. Nevertheless there is relatively more freedom in ESO than there ever was in SWTOR. People didnt quit SWTOR because it was a bad game. It wasnt a bad game and arguably had some of the best story of any MMO ever. People quit because they finished the game. They finished the main story maybe even an alt or twos story and then ran out of things to keep them paying that monthly fee.They are making these games to be single player online games but the problem with single player games is that you finish them. Old school MMOs were games you never finished. Really ESOs strength in terms of retaining subscriptions is the PvP which SWTOR neglected so it will be interesting to see what difference that makes. But if it were not for the PvP and the game had to stand on PvE alone I suspect it would face a similar dramatic dropoff in subs . . . and that may still yet happen. ,elderscrollsonline,ch1pol6,2,t5_2tqi0

870972,0,t1_ch36arc,Excellent points.I feel like adding that when defending a keep from a siege or a mob of enemies and you have an allied group on the ground trying to git rid of the pest the fireballista is a decent tool for helping them out. On the walls you have a better overview of the field and when you spot enemies trying to sneak you can use it to reveal their position  and pull them out of their stealth  while drawing your allies attention to their whereabouts. It has reasonably quick rate of fire plus it slows the enemies down when you hit.As a fellow DK who also had my ass handed to me more than I like to admit equip a bow as your secondary weapon once you hit level  and level up some bow skills. That way you can stay back while still contributing to the battle. And lastly dont give up! You can still have fun and play a role in the battles even at lower levels.

People tend to do this with all big MMOs to predict future content. They did it in ESO and found an Alfiq companion was in the game files just not implemented yet.The pet is named Analfiq Cat which is more likely to mean its a member of some Alfiq tribe named Analfiq or it could be unrelated but the similarity in names and the fact that it looks like a housecat imply that its an Alfiq.,elderscrollsonline,ch5bv5u,1,t5_2tqi0

903434,0,t3_24gr4n,I also went through ups and downs as a meleefocused nightblade but found a system that sort of works in VR content.  To help with the squishiness and even DPS the key revelation was Leeching Strikes or the other morph take your pick.  Having that up full time allows you to continuously pop in and out of invis over a sustained fight greatly improving your survivability.   Yes your attacks will individually hit for less but because your magickastamina pool replenishes very quickly you can spam your abilities more.   I toggle it off before my opener if I really want to burst but after that its pretty much always togged on.  If you weapon swap make sure Leeching is on both bars.For DPS make sure youre weaving in a skill after every LAttack.  Try flying knife as your stamina dump unless you morphed it to Shrouded Daggers for AoE.   If you are DWing dont underestimate Blood Craze  it stacks.  Dont neglect your buffs.  Mark Target.  Focussed Attacks isnt the greatest but it can help leech resources back faster.  Momentum from the H line.  Evil Hunter.  Also a trick I dont see mentioned a lot is the Mages Guild passive Might of the Guild.  Have Magelight on your buff bar cast it before a fight then swap to your other bar and your opening Surprise Attack will hit harder.On packs of  or more the amount of time you can afford to be out of stealth and LAttacking is shorter but the process is more or less the same.Its tedious compared to some of the AoE classesbuilds but at least its functional and in its own way its kind of fun.  Hope that helps.The true signature of the melee DPS nightblade however is just how much initial damage you can do out of stealth.  A fully charged Harvest Soul or the other morph does roughly k out of stealth if you gear right and use Mark Target and a few other synergies.  ,elderscrollsonline,ch6z4ts,2,t5_2tqi0

It hurts PvP and PvE for other reasons by making zerg groups group together by standing as close as possible to reduce enemies AoEs effects. Basically when they fix all the skills well see groups of  people all trying to stay as close as possible slowly edging to their objective. It remains to be seen how siege weapons which have no cap will change this.Its a horrible bandaid fix for a design problem. Then again they seem to take the easy way out on most things in this game instead of resolving the underlying problems.

954557,0,t1_chcqlva,You are not visible to enemies if you are crouched and the eye icon is fully closed ie a horizontal line with text hidden under it. They do not see you nor your ghost nor your shadow nor any icons. Its as if you were not there.When enemies get closer maybe m or so cant remember and varies a bit based on passives they have a chance to see you if they are facing your direction. The eye icon starts opening. While its not fully open you can still try to manoeuvre and maintain your stealth after the breach. E.g. if you are the person looking at the hidden enemy you will see him appear briefly. At that point he can still try to move away from your field of viewrange but you can hit him and pop him out of stealth if you are quick enough.Edit To add if you get very close to enemy I think he will inevitably see you unless you go beyond the detection radius but its possible to execute a stealth attack in a short time window and getting the stealth bonus for the attack which you would not get should the enemy see you.

Though I am still holding on to a glimmer of hope at this point. In the recent AMA Brian Wheeler did say that XP for player kills will be doubled.  However he left two things unclear. Whether this applies to veteran points. Whether ZOS actually wants PvPers to level at a competitive rate to what is possible in PvE or will this just make it a little better.

961700,0,t1_chd7g70,Right and I completely agree with everything you said but that leads us back to the issue of why people try to rush through content to get to end game. Its because in most MMOs the only challenging group content is at endgame. If developers really want to reinvent the genre I think the leveling part of MMOs is where they need to be looking at. They have been kinda tweaking it ever since WoW came out with the whole quest to max instead of grind to max model but the tweaks have been just that a tweak. All they have really added was voice over and the illusion of choice you can save or not save X person but over the course of the game your choice may affect only one or two other quests tops. Its not like a single player where your choice will give you a completely different ending. Being that these games are MMOs if they want people to spend more time leveling or doing whatever that isnt endgame they need to make it more challengingrewarding.,elderscrollsonline,chdlrkt,1,t5_2tqi0

Lazy and expect immediate gratification for small amounts of effort. Go back to WoW if you dont want to work for rewards. I am currently  the way through VR and feel by the time I hit VR I will have the ingame friend base to have an epic endgame raiding guild.They did not spend years making this game to have the majority of the games population at max level in  months. Go play a nonMMO if you want to beat a game  months after release. I know that I am in this for the long haul and am enjoying the content. Just my opinion of course.

968376,0,t1_cheae4h,I think it is the my precious child problem. A project often becomes dear to the people who work on it and they come to see only the good bits the bits they really polished and spent a lot of effort on. While the bad bits get ignored not out of malice but they arent anyones pet so nobody works on them in the weekend in their own time to get them just right.Take all the jokes in the game with the skeletons. I havent seen a single one that is half stuck in scenery or in anyway bugged. I can just imagine someone having made that their pet project and scouring the bug database for any mention of that problem and fixing it ASAP because it is their precious and it is totally worth doing some unpayed overtime to fix it.Meanwhile other bugs get fixed as they are assigned as they should be. I am a webdeveloper myself and one project involved an email marketing tool it consisted of a frontend to create the marketing campaign and a backend to send the mails. We had several people working on the backend to make it faster and just me working on the frontend to make sure it wouldnt crash when customers worked with it.They eventually made it so fast they had to throttle the tool because it was overloading the client website if  mil customers get the email at once and they all open it and click on the links that can be far to much for client servers. But did they then start to help me with the frontend to make sure customers wouldnt leave because they dont give a shit if mails go out in an hour or in a day but do care if their entire campaign disappears into smoke because of a bug?Did they hell they worked on their precious engine and forgot the rest.I imagine I can see a similar attitude in this game.The social functions chatemail and the protection against abuse of these functions gold sellers is really dismal.I also know it really isnt all that complex I build systems for it myself to avoid linkspam and hate speech in webshop and forums. But it isnt sexy I only do it because it is the max of my skill set. But you need the low level noninteresting stuff to make sure the good stuff isnt ruined by it. ESO itself is a good game it works the game is fun but they really screwed up with the low level elements. It isnt even so much as if they forgot to do QA but that they only did it on parts of the game and left other bits hanging.It is as if they build a bridge and talk about the majesty of the span the way the sun reflects on the structure the sheer size of the bridge and act annoyed when you ask them when they are going to install the aircraft warning lights. Trivial you might think and you are right. Trivial but essential. QA is more then just bug testing it also involves making sure a product is complete. A car in which everything works as it should shouldnt pass QA if seatbelts werent part of the design. Zenimax forgot to finish the game before it launched and bots have taken over the game. A bug can rather easily be fixed but fixing the complete lack of any exploit protection requires a culture change basically the people in charge need to hire an outsider to make sure this stuff is added and gets priority.Maybe this is why the console versions have been delayed so they can focus now on adding stuff that should have been part of  year development process.Why can low levels even enter high level areas? Why can low levels send infinite emails. Why can low levels accept high level quests. Why can bots teleport. Why does jute respawn so fast.QA is really hard harder even then coding because you need to think of the things the engineer didnt think off. Finding what is wrong with a product is far easier then finding what is missing. It is like completing a checklist where the trick is finding what is not on the checklist to check.What I notice on this and other forums is that a lot of people think developers are god like and coding is magical. It is not when you have experience in the field you really start to see how badly Zenimax screwed up. At least with the  month delay of the console release they seem to be aware of it themselves.Now it remains to be seen if this will just be a sloppy launch or if it will deterioate into an Age of Conan console never happened or a FF rebuild.,elderscrollsonline,ched4c5,4,t5_2tqi0

993024,0,t3_25gwk3,I know xfire is not a perfect measure of population activity in a game but its really the best that weve got and imo is not bad to use in theory. ESO activityFFxiv activity for comparisonThe activity for ESO hovers around  before some major fixes in the  patch. Then we see a huge spike relatively of activity with attrition over time. The up spikes are weekends. And like anyevery game there is always attrition over time no matter that game it is. ESO Attrition from    Mon FFxiv Attrition from    Mon .ESO Attrition from    Sat FFxiv Attrition from    Sat .ESO Attrition after patch    Sat FFxiv Attrition    Sat I just arbitrarily picked Mondays for the low end of activity and Saturdays for the high end of activity. I guess a disclaimer may be that ESO is a new game so fluctuations can be high. However it should be noted that just because its a new game doesnt mean it is always natural for it to see a big drop in activity. Some games can pick up quite a bit of traction in the opening months. Im not going to make any conclusions but these are the observed numbers from a source that may or may not be accurate.

As with most heavyinternetusers of my generation I have been exposed to more cultures than I could have possibly imagined. A good friend of mine for sevenyears lives in Germany. Never once have I met this person but I am exposed to the realities of Europes issues vicariously through him. I learned the difference between Salaam and Wasalaam due to an Arabic friend. These opportunities are too golden to let go. Now that the internet is more tame and safe for younger audiences I feel that this is a ripe age for them to have even more experiences than I ever could.

The only factor the  builds have in common is your HP.

Its the purest best form of what it does. No one has yet done better.I mean really?  Do I need to quote anything else to prove my point?  Heres the bottom line.  Moving from one MMO to another means starting over from scratch in a world where your former achievements mean absolutely nothing and where you have to go through the awkward social process of building friendships all over again.  A lot of people that play WoW are resistant to having to put forth this effort ever again... EVER!  So they desperately look for reasons to hate any other MMO to justify not wanting to set off in pursuit of new frontiers.  Its like some weird form of Internet social anxiety disorder.  As many legitimate criticisms of ESO as there are this guy missed them all in a desperate attempt to convince himself that it just isnt worth leaving WoW.

1035248,0,t1_chlwx1x,I agree with the OP. I was super excited for hitting VR mainly because I thought I could finally go to Cyrodiil and not just get destroyed by VR players. Now with so many VRs its still like Im in my s. I still have to roll with the zerg to do anything other than watch my character lying face down dead. Im not saying a VR shouldnt be stronger but they shouldnt be so strong that they are impossible to kill. Even in other MMOs where you have PvP gear you are at least able to contribute without being in top tier stuff. Ive been pretty discouraged from playing lately because I really want to PvP but to be able to help at all I feel like I need to grind for another  days of PLAYED game time to even be competitive. And by then craglorn will be out with even MORE VR levels to grind....The way they could fix this would be by removing the VR restrictions on gear imo. That way a VR  would still have a stat bonus over lower VR levels but it wouldnt be a crazy gap that makes them untouchable to VR lt as it is now. Hell even just take away the VR restriction on VR gear. If I could use the gear I actually get from running VR dungeons without having to grind an entire factions zone that would at least make me feel like Im hitting the enemy with something other than a wet noodle. rant,elderscrollsonline,chlynx5,2,t5_2tqi0

1071488,0,t1_chpuln5,gt There is way more to testing a game than simply throwing a designer at it and having him write out a basic bug report.This I can see this makes sense. Although most of the bugs I have seen in this game are very obvious I keep falling through the world that shouldnt happen I can see how someone wouldnt know to write down I keep falling through the world in Cyrodil after porting from Craglorn etc. Then again Zenimax held a number of beta tests before this game released if they expected the general public to help them with their testing then I dont know why they cant just pull their own employees to test it. gtIts not what I gave them my money for. Now whos right and whos wrong? Which of us has the valid claim? The answer is Neither.Still me and the people who agree with me that the game is broken. If you are happy with the way that the game is right now Im not sure why you would disagree with them making it even more playable. If you are fine with companies releasing bugridden glitchfilled hackerpopulated but goodlooking piles of poo then Im afraid how this is going to affect the game companies. You even mention that you worked QA but are OK with how the game is. After working in QA yourself how can you be happy with a QA team that very very obviously didnt do its job? What if the animators just forgot to animate sword swings? Would that be OK too just because you only use Axes and you are happy with them?gtThe  a month goes to maintenance of the game world as well not just the servers it goes to adding new content.I feel like I am wrong on this one but I cant find any solid posts to prove it. I simply feel like Hey give us month and we will keep this game up and sometimes add new things is a better description of the game than Hey give us month and we will keep adding new things and also keep the game up.gtThats you opinion. Mine is that I paid for A and I got A. Now theyre in the process of adding B and C and Im gonna see if B and C are as entertaining to me as A is. Which of us is wrong? Again the answer is neither.Except it isnt my opinion. I paid for A the same as you did but I didnt get A. I got something that looks like A but plays like D.gtI wasnt aware that they had stopped fixing issues. Because in that last patch I not only saw the addition of a new zone I also saw a ton of bug fixes. Now if they stopped fixing things Id say you were right but there has been absolutely no indication that the dev teams have ceased bug fixes.Good point. I guess I would really nail down what I want to be a better prioritization of fixes. I couldnt care less that yellow flowers not show as yellow instead of golden I want Character no longer falls through the world making that character unplayable for the next  hours. I want all the developers working on the most important issues first and then moving on to the spit and polish. When I have an issue with a VM at work I dont just sit there by myself trying little fixes over a few weeks with ESO we are almost at two months now. If I am stuck with an issue I clone the VM I set it up in a new lab area and I ask for more eyes on it. If I dont find the answer someone else will and we fix the damn server. I havent EVER let a client just be down for two months because I dont want anyone elses help. gtYou are telling me that  of the players playing this game have recently encountered progress halting bugs?Yes. I invite you to go visit the official forums visit some fansites and browse around here. What do you see?  posts about how the game doesnt work for every one person who is happy. Maybe you are right and the people who are happy are busy playing the game. Well that doesnt help the people who ARE unhappy with the games state and it doesnt help the image of the game.Just yesterday I saw a post from someone considering buying into the game but they saw this forum before they bought. They actually decided not at least last I saw to buy the game simply because to any outsider it looks like this game is an absolute failure. And even worse it doesnt look like the situation has gotten any better over the past  months. I remember back when SWTOR had a large number of game breaking bugs but there were still tons of positive posts on the front page of that forum that shone through the shit. You cant convince me that ESO players are just that entranced with the game that they are too busy to tell anyone about it. The number of people with issues simply overwhelms the people who dont have issues thats the simple truth. gtYes it does.Oh all the nightblade skills not working? Welp thats merely annoying to me I play DK. I dont know why all those people who rolled NBs are so upset those issues arent gamebreaking for them because they arent gamebreaking for ME.gtI also stated that they should be taking more time to work on the new content to ensure that it doesnt get released and causes problems adding to the list of bugs that need to be fixed. With that I am in agreement with other people new content should not be released with bugs if its buggy then shelve it because they dont need to add to the current list of issues.I would agree with this. If the devs absolutely positively HAVE to release new content to keep the game alive then I want them to do it. I have every right to demand that if they are using my month to pay for new content then that content better fucking be  free of any and all bugs. Otherwise like you said shelve it.But they arent. The updates they have come out with are introducing a whole host of new issues. They very obviously arent testing jack shit. What would you rather they do? Stop putting bugs into the game go back and fix the ones that exist? Or keep adding new content meanwhile adding three new bugs for every one that the QA team fixes? That will very quickly kill this game. ,elderscrollsonline,chq2zfi,1,t5_2tqi0

It highlights the problem with classes like the Templar  we have a wonderful healing toolkit but ALL other classes can heal the content with a resto staff. You dont NEED a Templar even though theyre very good at healing to do any of it. When you start competing for faster times  which would you take? A class that can do an average of dps with their offhand weaponbuild or a class that can do dps? If they didnt want to see this happen they should have held off on timed leader boards until there was a bit more class balance.

You dont have to rely on healing yourself but it certainly can help and templars are the kings of burst healing. The downside of using the big Templar heal while tanking is the high magicka cost and it wont heal as much since your stats have less spell power in tank gear. I prefer not to use any heals except an absorb spell ability that morphs from defensive stance from the hampshield skill line. Otherwise my other  abilities currently are one that shields me for  of my HP shields more than big heal casted by myself and for less magicka. It also does a nice chunk of aoe damage when it breaks a mele taunt weapon skill line a ranged taunt undaunted guild skill line and the th ability is volcanic rune mages guild fire rune morph to toss enemies up in the air.

Although I disagree about the Thieves Guild or Dark Brotherhood line correct me if Im wrong but those two are not supposed to come out for some time. I would rather have them fixed sooner rather than later. That however is a minor detail. I simply thought that the concept of magica as a blockcc breaksprintdodge etc. would be an interesting concept. Blocking equals warding from skyrim. CC Break the player glows and then breaks free like they are charging energy. Dodge could be a sudden burst to the side. Sprint could be a burst from beneath the characters feet as they run. Then you could have a magica ability and say four stamina based abilities.

There are still bugs that have lasted nearly  months and they havent been resolved. Same issue for broken class skills amp amps. Once you get to  youre stuck doing daily quests and an archaic attunement process which is quite difficult because adventures and dungeons are more overtuned than the average group can handle also bugs can often screw your group over. The only reason Carbine is always defended and excused is because of their constant communication with reddit and the lack of people at endgame. As more people progress and deal with these issues the community will become more toxic and the developers wont want to poke their heads into every thread. On the official forums as it stands now people who bring up any issues about the leveling experience are promptly labeled a casual and are mocked. Bring up any issue with endgame people will label you as a neckbeard or a troll who shouldnt rush through content. Its as bad as the ESO forums.Its easy to look at the surface of another MMO and think darn the grass sure looks greener over there. In truth it hardly ever is.

Healing the random critter or Clannfear  is not going to help the ally that yells HEAL ME in mumble because he is at  life. You push your heal to full life button  times in a row just to have it go to some random NPC.The good Templars in bigscale PvP which Cyrodiil is mainly made for fall back to resto abilities  which other classes can simply do better.

1398830,0,t3_2a52gr,ESO should be played by everyone who enjoys high fantasy.  The writing and stories are sometimes excellent.However fans of MMOs may be frustrated There is practically no player interdependence most players keep to themselves. Combat is trivial for anyone who bothers to learn it which makes gear upgrades pretty pointless.  Gear dropped from mobs and from quests is all a player needs. Extremely limited raid content.  You cant even really call it raid content.  Trials. Poor balance.  All MMOs right?  Well its really bad in this one at a competitive trials level.  At a noncompetitive level it doesnt matter because of the aforementioned easy combat. Character building is fun if you enjoy PVP andor Trials but pointless otherwise  Gear isnt even required to kill VR mobs. The game is effectively in beta anything can change.  As weve seen.I was a huge supporter of this game until a big part of the game I enjoy was taken away.

1467544,0,t1_cj07p17,Well when I think back about how in Age of Conanall other problems that game had aside you were always at risk of dying and it WAS a lot of fun. Part of the fun though is that the death penalty wasnt too terrible. Sometimes RNG isnt in your favor and you die and you can potentially waste time. I think thats whats at stake here whether not you effectively wasted the last  minutes or hour. I know in DAoC I dont miss dying and losing exp ONE BIT and never want to see it in an MMO ever again. There were too many random variables that were NOT within your control that could cause you to wipe once twice or three times very quickly and effectively cause you to lose  minutes  minutes an hour or even longer. In this day and age thats a thing of the past that usually only the most hardcore want to see back.But yes I agree having risk of dying while leveling CAN be fun but it shouldve been risk while leveling from . Not VR. Nowadays you see people who hate leveling in MMOs and only want to get to the endgame so they welcome faceroll leveling. Some of the more popular raiding guilds would try to find ways to hit max level as fast as humanly possible because they dont care about the leveling. Some would argue that maybe they shouldnt play MMOs but who is to say they shouldnt either? shrugI agree I hate the GOGOGO mentality. As someone who is almost exclusively a tank in an MMOs no one hates GOGOGO more than Tanks being told that. I also agree that youre right the game can be made challenging without too punishing and I would welcome that too. I wouldve welcomed it from  but not VR where Im fed up that I have to do MORE questing just to reach endgame. They couldve kept the VR difficulty from  and removed VR and I wouldve said awesome a game that actually wants leveling to be difficult.While there are some pros to a few of the features you listed regarding Blizzards most recent changes with WoW its hard not to see the cons as well. I know what you mean. Some people like the changes others dont. There are pros and cons to both depending on what kind of player you are. Sometimes I like the catch up mechanisms because I dont commit to the game that long. Other times I hate it because then I run out of content too fast. gtHas anyone actually come across real data as too the difficulty difference numerically wise between prechange VR and current VR difficulty?I dont know. I havent even seen how much its been changed in any way just that people say its much soloable now. But thats in .which is on PTS I think right? Im sure more data will come out eventually. Im okay with them dumbing down the VR difficulty because I was in favor of removing VR entirely and didnt want to go through that annoying quest grind. But I would be in favor of them making  harder to compensate.,elderscrollsonline,cj08d1s,1,t5_2tqi0

1493594,0,t1_cj3flfa,gtAkiviri Yokeda And Dwemer which are all extinct races in tamriel that randomly come back from the dead and try to take White Gold Tower in cyrodil to join the alliance war.Dwemer would be out hands down. A huge mass of Dwemer appearing out of nowhere would seriously take some lore gymnastics to gel with what the lore is the Dwemer have been extinct since the first era.Yokuda would be a possibility...despite their homeland being under water it wouldnt take too much to write in a splinter faction of them that didnt want to go to Hammerfell. But its doubtful since there isnt any mention of Yokudan survivors in the lore. They would be a much better NPC race.Akaviri would be the most plausible since by the time ESO starts it has only been  years since the last Akaviri invasion which could allow for refugees or other types. Jorunn actually was present and fought the Akaviri though so it might take some fancy writing to get him to allow them in his alliance.But when its all said and done I think adding other playable races is a horrible idea. There are already so many options and adding others could be very hard to keep consistent lorewise.,elderscrollsonline,cj3hwds,2,t5_2tqi0

1494025,0,t3_2b9zse,Right now Im not subscribed but I do still follow the game hoping certain things get fixed. But here are my thoughtsPros Leveling  is great. I leveling through Ebonheart Pact area and have to say level  was my favorite leveling experience out of any theme park mmo Ive played. PvP is pretty fun in the beginning. Crafting is well executed Graphics are great probably best of any mmo out there They have been actively balancing certain spellsskills that have been problematic in pvp unlimited bat swarm sorceror teleporting etc. Cons I didnt enjoy VR ranks at all turns into a grind. I quit at VR PvP is unbalanced at the moment. Cloth and Staff seems to be better than everything else right now. Heavy Armor which I chose to specialize in is pretty useless in PvP right now. PvP gets a bit repetitive. Pretty much just zerging from one keep to the next. I would have liked more strategy involved and more sandbox elements in Cyrodiil.,elderscrollsonline,cj3jucf,1,t5_2tqi0

Go resto staff because its broken as fuck  and the class abilities dont care about your weapon to do the damage or animation.  veiled strikes or whatever morph   teleport strike  assassins blades   all work no matter what.  so might as well  have healing  mana return on heavy  bonus to dps.  Veil of blades as ult is probably a given.   And Id say  get fancy with... necro orb or trapping webs.  for flavor.  Vamp drain would be all the sustain you ought to need.  id go pure caster and ignore melee based attacks all together   maybe rock magelight for the increased crit.   and just figure out the most gruesome spells to sling at people.

1665596,0,t1_cjp38z2,I dont disagree that the armor abilities should require  pieces of armor but that they should be made ultimate level if that requirement is made.Swarm ultimate doesnt need a cost increase. Its the same price as Veil of Blades and similar ultimates. Vamps get a discount to it by going stage  which brings their health regen down to  or so as compared to magic and stamina regens up in the s. Fire resist IS half effective on vampires as they are climbing out of a giant Fire vulnerability hole in the first place.Every skill has at least one counter. Use it effectively. Dragon Knight blocking got you down? Fear him. vampire bats coming your way? Magnum shot will keep him at bay you at bay and him unable to move for two seconds.

1700745,0,t3_2dvnbb,Im not sure many would agree but I dont see why they have classes. It makes sense from an MMO perspective but fans of the Elder Scrolls games Im sure were disappointed in this aspect. Why not just give everyone the abilities for all of the classes? It can still be limited by skill points so not everyone has every spell. I know a lot of people would also say Well how would you balance it? It would actually be easier than having classes since everyone has access to all of the abilities. Then all you have to do is tweak individual abilities. Having no classes would make this game stand out even more and I think would be great assuming its done right.

What you probably should have said is after the opener NBs do less damage on spikes but still have the highest burst in the game. Cause even if we dont do  on every strike we do            in .s. And I am not even adding dots from enchants. You can try hard but you will never have such a burst with any other class. And it doesnt matter if you have your resto staff cause a good NB will stun you when you start healing and your heals will probably be  less efficient. ,elderscrollsonline,cjzmrcx,3,t5_2tqi0

If you really want to include that in the comparison they are still equal numbers just  higher P. So in context with what I was comparing that statement is indeed  correct and that was without factoring in temporary buffs that both could use.Just as my comparison shows a sprinting horse with rapid for example would be faster than a stealthing concealed weaps vampire with nights silence.

I bought second account to use all my knowledge to have fun. I finished literally everything in game and  months ago I had played  days on my first account which was average h per day in Tamriel! thats quite a lot and finished  quests all dungeons anchors and  achievements. After I finished everything I still wanted to enjoy ESO so I started to break game.I dont regret it I had a lot of fun I was able to explore all islands  not possible to explore normal way. I soloed trials leveled up my alt from Veteran Rank  to Veteran Rank  in  hours ikr everyone want to level up that fast D and much more. I recorded everything of it so I can remember these beautiful moments.As summary I can add only one thing  ESO is still very bugged game and some mechanics are programmed very bad. I know that people hate bug users etc etc but my first intention was to help ZOS. After they didnt listen I started to have fun with it without disturbing others of course.And for horse flying here is reddit post how to launch yourself using mount bad mount mechanics  Beta for flying mounts.  like someone said DPs.

1824296,0,t3_2ffp1a,The way the current economy is setup you get opportunity for deals.If there was a centralized banking system everyone would know the bottom line price for everything and it would be very difficult to get a good deal on anything.  With guild stores you have more opportunity to run into morons that dont know what the prices truly are. Ive probably bought more purp weaponsarmor under G than I can remember and then sell the tempers for like K.  Still have no idea why people dont just decon these guys.So ya you gotta deal with the dolts that over price stuff but then you got the flip side where people are selling stuff dirt cheap oblivious to their own blunders. This would never happen in a  market system.  My opinion...take the good with the bad.Here some tips that have helped me.Trait selling is popular and lucrative find the sweet spot price and start making traits that are hard to get.  Try to start documenting which traits seem more rare or do some reading online.  Good example Staffs sharpened trait seems rare you maybe able to get g for that oneRare food ingredients sell well because they only come from hirelings.  Solution  Put skill points in provio hireling. Make alts.  For each alt get them to like lvl .  Then decon different mats until you get to lvl  for wood enchant cloth amp blacksmithing.  That way you can get the  hireling skill tree open for each craft. I currently got  alts rocking this I pick up roughly  yellow purp mats a day.,elderscrollsonline,ck90n95,2,t5_2tqi0

Nightblade Vampire Blood Craze  Stealth whichever morph  Siphoning Attacks  Steel tornado  Ambush ULT Bat swarmVeil of Blades.  of my abilities scale off stamina Blood craze Steel tornado and ult. those are for damage.

1933067,0,t1_ckm379f,All true. First of all I thought you were saying that the Sorc choice caused you to choose to make her in Light Armor and that in turn made her less proficient at bow use. I think I was incorrect.My DK Archer has a mishmash of armor types at the moment and also has a Destro Staff. Its a very balanced build. I can even switch to Resto staff if we need a healer in a pinch. I seem to do OK. Its nice to be able to utilize both my full Magicka and Stamina bars even if each ability use isnt as effective as if I fully specd that way. More importantly its because I love variety.,elderscrollsonline,ckm4d4r,1,t5_2tqi0
1933833,0,t1_ckm5hgw,Because it rarely works that way. This video is a mash up of what may of taken weeks to produce. If you watch the video every kill is very carefully setup. Theyre either away from healersassistance have low health to begin with or are wholly unprepared for that type of combat at that time. In normal group play that first snipe or heavy attack would be healed almost instantly or theyd CC break and selfhealmove out of the way making this type of gameplay very specific to situations. It also heavily relies on stealth bonus which in a group can be extremely difficult to achieve with group members popping you in and out of combat constantly. Also the more important fact when he was finish his resources were always low too low to engage another target. He would and does have to wait between engagements in a time where seconds matter.For example take the end of the video the field battle around the m or so mark. He xsouse didnt do much that entire battle. His damage output was low and the majority of his resources were constantly used for roll dodgingCC breaks and rarely for attacking. The only time they gained ground during the battle was when he switched over to SwordShield and shield charged people to the ground so his group could kill them. You dont need to be a stamina build to use shield bash in fact he would in this situation be more effective with the normal Sypher DK build because he can talons afterwards rooting them in place. It worked yes but he would of been more effective with a different more rounded build.Stamina builds all suffer from the same problems. Sustained Damage and utility. There is no sustained damage beyond the initial burst which canis be easily healed at which point your stamina pool becomes mobilitysurvivability rather than DPS oriented  and you end up lacking the utility that comes from magcika based abilities. Weapon abilities have very little utility compared to class abilities. Group play relies on utility and sustained damage output rather than burst damage. Without it you can be easily flanked and destroyed as a group.Is it fun? Absolutely yes. I do it all the time with my purely leveled in Cyrodiil Nightblade. Is it effective all the time? Absolutely not only some situations does this type of build excel. Is it effective for the majority of combat in ESO right now? Also no most combat involves tightly grouped people with a number of healers making your initial hits a waste of resources. Is it good for group play? No it lacks sustained damage and utility. Fights last longer than a few seconds if you use all your resource up in the first volley youll die shortly after. Thats why its a problem. Im not saying dont have fun Im saying and in a ranty way the OP dont use this build and expect it to be effective  of the time it wont. Not with the way the game is as of today. This video is good I especially liked the super snipes on Crystalized seriously wtf happened there but people have to realize you cant do this all the time. The game just doesnt work this way not the way things are right now.Also bitching about a single abilityclass weakens your argument. ,elderscrollsonline,ckm7ouh,2,t5_2tqi0

In the time it takes to get the animation overwith you are dead if its not a killing blow.  Adding a AoE knockback would really fit the class.Flawless dawnbreaker also would be awesome with a knockback.

2163055,0,t1_clepbdc,Catering to mac in the first place is something game companies only recently started doing. You have to write code differently for mac than you have to for PC and macs still only make up something like  of computers worldwide. It is a lot of extra work and they want to make sure an overwhelming majority of players can play with the new features as they are ready. Mac getting updates and games at a later date is pretty common for most games. It just doesnt make sense for most companies to delay updates or games to do simultaneous releases for mac and PC. Some big companies can do it yes but they have crazy budgets and larger teams. So far we dont even know when patch  is so a week after it is announced it is a little absurd to be asking for a date for when mac will be getting face FX. It may be a little more appropriate to ask this question a week or two after patch  launches when more information will possibly be available. I think youll find yourself running into this problem with many games Id suggest looking into budget gaming PC builds. You can build a pretty powerful system for around  and if you keep the warranty information around you can get support for just about any problem. ,elderscrollsonline,clervde,1,t5_2tqi0

Bad decision.Your entire class tree outside critical surge stormform and streak are are useless Im not including ultimates in this discussion of which only Overload is bad.Its the plain truth. Sorcerer lacks any means to regenerate stamina as a melee character and thats a really big downside. Sorcerer also lacks AoE when not using staff because both stamina skills and Lightning Flood are really bad Whirlwind is only good on targets below .So yeah if I had spent all my time that it took to get to VR doing every single zones quest dolmen and delve on a different class like NB or DK the results would have been a lot better.You know what else would have been better? A race other than Bosmer.You think you are doing people a favor by telling them they can play how they want but then they invest all this time get to Craglorn and nobody wants to invite them to trials because they dont have full epiclegendary robes and staff and wasted their gold on gear other than a Warlock set.And the game gets really boring when you have nothing to do because you rolled the wrong class and role setup and groups just want a specific setup.,elderscrollsonline,clg530f,0,t5_2tqi0

I did crypt of hearts yesterday and both dps used  aoe. I had to simultaneously heal and dps in order for us to complete the dungeon.

2273923,0,t1_clsrcyn,This is where I can not say much because I didnt do any Vet dungeons before the Update. But it is true that the man dungeons are naturally harder than nondungeon mobs of the same Lvl. Perhaps people were expecting a noticable difference but it doesnt show?              I wonder about this prospective from a Full V group in a V Dungeon. Only saying cause from what I saw in a V Vet Darkshade with a V V V and V. It was difficult but we still did a damn good job with the right coordination. When you think of that we had all those high ranked Vets in V should have been cakewalk right? But it seemed like mechanics were more valuable than Rank because I was the V Tank Vampire and I wasnt being facerolled. For instance the first boss with the Fire me and the V ended up staying alive while the other  died.

2276171,0,t3_2l9oea,My group wiped on almost every boss atleast once  the last boss it took  attempts for gold.  Am I upset about this nope.  In the course of the vet daily dungeon I started out as a single target dps with off heals for the healer  but then we struggled with ads so turned out some aoes.  I changed tactics and abilities per boss encounter.  I even was a kite tank on the three guar looking things because they kept one shotting the tank.  On the last boss I slotted rapid maneuver so we could all run to the opposite side of the boss so we werent getting wrecked by lightening.  This is the difficulty I was hoping for these shouldnt be a walk in the park for the undaunted gold key with great loot.  You have to remember you are doing hard mode for silver key and extra hard mode for the boss to get the gold key for the best loot. If you go into this and dont think you need to change your skills on your bars to succeed where I think it should be you are just hurting your party.  I like the fuck yeah feeling when I win hard encounters anything less then this i will not feel that fuck yeah feeling for me if they make it easier.

Its stone is the source of the Tribunals divinity and the beat underlying Tonal Architecture.WhiteGold is arguably more powerful than AdamantiagtLike all of the polydox constructs of the earliest Aldmer whatever their abnegaurbic creed WhiteGold Tower is a conduit of creatia aad sembia sembio built to bring about a reversal of the congealing spiritual bleed caused by the Convention. In other words it was a focus point for rereaching the divine.gtThough the Ayleids gave theirs a central Spire as the imago of Adamantia the whole of the polydox resembled the Wheel with eight lesser towers forming a ring around their primus.

The longer a team goes for the more opponents are allowed to enter the opposite side  mwa ha haa There are no prizes  rewards only the joy of watching your opponents fall to their knees If a person was invited to a dungeon they would put their hands up and concede so they could leave the arena There is no Armour damage so you dont leave for dungeon having been wreckedOk Ill calm down now cos I love this idea,elderscrollsonline,cm5terj,6,t5_2tqi0

2398306,0,t1_cm7i1bg,Agreed. One AoE ultimate like Nova or possibly blazing spear should kill any orbs around the harvester quite quickly even in a small space.

2509716,0,t1_cmlulh6,Agreed. As one poster on the forums noted it would have been better just to fix the fact that the spell reflected many things that did not seem to be projectiles as well as ultimates. Personally I would have just changed it to reflect only physical projectiles. That would meant that DKs would still be the antidote to bows which are currently ruling Cyrodiil. As it stands reflecting  projectiles still makes it x better than the nearest equivalent Defensive Posture in the SB line. And that only reflects spells as well so Scales is really more than x better than anything similar that any other class can get.It sure needed a nerf though.,elderscrollsonline,cmm5peg,1,t5_2tqi0

2572259,0,t3_2p89s9,Since you mentioned GW I have to tell you that is inventory in ESO is a fucking shit design compared to GW inventory system specially for crafting materials. Soon you will hit a point when you going to have to destroy crafting materials just to open room for other stuff. Unfortunately for me that was a deal breaker even though ESO iswas my favorite MMO. Crafting materials should never be counted towards the actual inventory limits...With everything GW has done wrong they did an amazing job on the inventory system design. That said enjoy the game and top notch voice acting. Edit If people gonna down vote me for sharing my opinion then its fine but nothing will change my opinion about the lazy bad design of the inventory system in ESO. ,elderscrollsonline,cmubzki,-3,t5_2tqi0

2610232,0,t3_2pqyi8,. I wouldnt say deserve but i can say why i want the game. Im kind of losing a little hope. In the past few months ive been waiting for the perfect game a game which has pretty much everything im looking for. There are specifics such as customization and a wide range of weapons and then theres general mechanics such as satisfying combat. I believe ESO is this game but the price tag is a bitch for me as im currently going through my third year of college and money isnt great. Itd be something fantastic to get from Christmas though. Ive played loads of MMOs loads of normal games and none of them have kept me interested for more than a few weeks or months. Ive been wanting ESO since release and i played back in beta it was amazing. I really miss it. Id also love to be a bigger part of this subreddit actually playing the game would help a lot.. Oh i would. Id play the hell out of this game. I have my girlfriend who enjoys games who i could perhaps  pass on the good deed to. If i find this game keeps me interested for more than a month ill almost certainly drag her onto it. It may only be adding to the playerbase by  but itll be  very dedicated players who are having a great time.. Definitely. Id give it an honest review with a lot of pros and cons. Hopefully i can persuade a few lucky souls to get it during its sale right now.. Covered in Whether i get a copy or not thank you so much for doing this OP. Reddit and the world in general needs more kind souls to you bringing the Christmas spirit in such large and expensive you poor thing! quantities. I hope when i eventually get ESO i see you in game ill be sure to have figured out a good emote to express my gratitude by then.Side Note I hope fezzes and bow ties are in the game dibs,elderscrollsonline,cmzami7,8,t5_2tqi0

2627128,0,t1_cn1i1rp,Build Diversification and Ability Changes  Eric WrobelWe have gone through pretty much every ability in the game to make sure that its something that you wanted to use to make sure that each ability has a use in a certain situation rather than some abilities and morphs being obviously better than others. We identified that if you were a Stamina user you didnt have a lot of options in your build. There were only the weapon abilities that you could spend your Stamina on but all the class abilities were Magicka based. To counteract this there are now around  abilities per class that have morphs which allow the skill to scale off your Stamina pool Weapon Damage and Melee Critical. We made that sort of change to weapon lines as well. Before if you were using a staff it would scale off your Weapon Damage and maximum Magicka. Now its a lot more clear and understandable. If you are using any ability that costs Magicka it scales off Magicka Spell Power and Spell Critical. Now you can build your character in whichever way you want and they will be powerful when you use your skills.A few specific changes we have made to some classes include a few abilities that we felt werent quite working the way we wanted them to. There were a number of abilities that never really hit the mark on balance some examples areInferno Dragonknight  this was constantly costing you Magicka and you had to toggle it on and off all the time but the damage was really low. The good reason to use this was for Ultimate generation but now thats standardized. There is a new version of Inferno which is similar to Mage Light in that it gives you a spell critical bonus and it shoots out fire that hits nearby enemies. Youll only be able to get one major critical buff so that component would not stack with Mage Light.Blinding Flash Templar  this was so powerful with the miss chance that we had to make a lot of bosses immune to it so it wasnt very useful in many situations. We scrapped that ability and replaced it with Radiant Destruction. Its a channeled attack that you can use at range and the lower health the enemy has the more damage it does.Haste Nightblade  this was a cool concept but because of light attack weaving this ability was never really useful or powerful. We replaced this ability with Grim Focus which is a duration buff which grants the Minor Damage Done buff for around  seconds. It tracks how many times you have attacked your target. Once you have done  attacks it swaps to a new attack that allows you to summon a spectral bow which shoots the enemy for a high amount of damage. This is really cool because its a highly interactive ability.Clannfear and Familiar Sorcerer  to improve upon the Sorcerer pets they now take less damage from area attacks making them much more survivable. Pets can now critically hit and their Critical Chance is based on your own so by improving your characters Crit Chance you improve your pets damage as well. We created a new morph of Daedric Curse called Daedric Prey when you cast it on an enemy your pets deal more damage to that target. This combines really well with Conjured Ward in DPS testing for trials the Sorcerer pet build has actually been the top build internally. Were probably going to take it down a little bit but pets should be much more viable now.There are also new AvA abilities that have been added two in each line. Magicka Detonation Assault  This goes hand in hand with the AoE changes we have made to try to bust up large groups. Its a ranged ability with a cast time that delays for  seconds after being applied that does really high AoE damage when it explodes. Its a nice riskvsreward ability. Enemies can interrupt you while you are casting it and enemies have time to run out of the main group before it explodes. Healers can dispel the curse too BUT there is a morph of the ability that if the curse is dispelled it explodes immediately.Vigor Assault  This ability adds a lot of unique things to the game we didnt have before. This is a Staminabased ability that will heal all your nearby allies. So if you have all your points in Stamina you can use this a lot and it will crit using your Melee Critical.Revealing Flare Support  This is super useful in PvP you throw it out into an area and it reveals all stealthed enemies in the area. You can throw as many flares as you want but its pretty expensive so you are giving up a lot of Magicka to cast it. Also as a stealther you have some time while the projectile is in the air to dodge out of the area and not get uncovered when it lands.Guard Support  This is a toggle ability any projectile that would hit a nearby ally will hit you instead. This ability can get you in a lot of trouble but it also is a great way to help turn the tide of battle by protecting your allies. You can combine it for example with Dragonknight reflective scale to send those projectiles back towards enemies. As a side note Reflective Scale now is limited in the number of projectiles that it can reflect.Another big effort we took on when rebalancing abilities was tooltip clarity there were a lot of abilities that had tooltips completely reworked to have more flavor and more information about the way the ability works.Synergy AbilitiesOne problem weve had is that there are currently a lot of Synergies available but a lot of them werent really desirable so you had to try really hard to time it to get the Synergy you wanted. Weve reduced the cooldown for using Synergies and reduced the radius to use them so you really have to try to use Synergies. Weve also made Synergies way better weve gotten rid of channeled synergies and made them all more significant and powerful. For example the Storm Atronach synergy now gives both the player and the Atronach an instant buff to outgoing damage. The synergies are now more rare more powerful and they now scale off whatever your highest stat is. So if you are a Stamina user synergy effectiveness will scale off Stamina Weapon Power and Weapon Critical rating.QampA SessionQ How will players get the XP they need for the Champion System if they have already finished quests rather than just grinding?We have tried to make more types of gameplay more rewarding. Weve made a lot of changes to dungeon XP and we are targeting making some changes in AvA. We have to be careful because we dont want player death trading or keep trading but the daily PvP quests are now much more rewarding because there are huge XP rewards there. We are trying to even out all the different playstyles in terms of what they reward for XP. Now you should be gaining a similar amount of XP regardless of which activity you do.,elderscrollsonline,cn1i2fz,2,t5_2tqi0

We he already free? Does he have a darkelf grudge? Did he escape slavery and thus he is a rougetype character?Or did he bust out in rage smashing the slavers face in with a barrel and is a more tanky character?You can go many different ways.

Internet culture plays a roll as well as expressing enjoyment is translated as fanboyism while expressing grievances or dislikes is culturally supported within its antiestablishment nature.This is the great hypocrisy of the internet ... Expressing truly independent thoughts often can place oneself against the flow of antiestablishment sentiment and one is ridiculed yet pandering toward such collective feelings is reveled as independent thought. .o ESO is unique in that I have never before seen so many mmo players walk into a game with heavy preconceived notions as to how the game should be.

I have knowingly sunk a lot of money into it.The way I see it is I dont want to see a game I enjoy go away so I am perfectly happy to pay for the experience Im getting.

I was soloing at level  in Cyrodiil and only had real issues with groups of mobs or strong ones in general like trolls. Grouping up with a buddy who was also level  and we were able to clear delves and kill bosses with next to no problem.PvP is also not impossible for one there is BWB you can go to and secondly because of battle leveling youre not an instant  hit kill.

2959040,0,t3_2u1br9,Sorcerer has the best and widest variety of ranged abilities of any class imo as well as having an entire skill line devoted to lightning abilities but if you dont want to roll a sorc theres always the lightning staff.  While any class can sneak nightblade gives you a . sec invis but is limited in ranged class abilities.  The main ranged skills for NB are in the siphoning line which are not great for dps.  In my experience bows are more suited to CC than DPS but you can make up the DPS with your class skills and other weapon.  Destruction staves give you good dps both at range and in close quarters with impulse.  The main thing to keep in mind when it comes to viability is attribute assignment.  It is still difficult to play a magickastamina hybrid effectively.  Specializing in either one is now very viable especially with the improvements to stamina abilities but you will be happiest if you pick one and stick to it.  While a sorcerer with a bow sounds like it will hit your first four points of preference it might be challenging because youll have to split your resources.  In terms of maximizing your effectiveness I would recommend choosing either archery stamina or lightning magicka and building your spec around that.  If you go archery I would recommend nightblade as you get the invisibility as well as some other skills that synergize with stealth and you can take a lightning staff as your backup weapon although resto staff also goes really well with a NB.  If you choose lightning youll enjoy being a sorcerer and take a staff for your main weapon for even more variety in ranged attacks and you can take a bow as your backup.  In both cases dont expect to be doing a ton of damage or lasting a terribly long time with your backup weapon if it relies on your off resource.  Alternatively you might consider having a melee weapon as your backup because you cant play keepaway forever or else take a resto staff for the heals.The best way to know of course is by playing.  Download the PTS if you dont have it already and make yourself a veteran template and just experiment to see what you like.  ,elderscrollsonline,co4gh2t,2,t5_2tqi0

I made no indication that I felt entitled to anything from ZOS in any way.What I did point out was that there does not seem to be much incentive to continue subscribing after .. So you get access to all new DLC and  crowns per  day membership. Unless the crowns cost more than . crowns and the DLC costs less than a couple months allowance of crowns there really is very little benefitincentive for subscribing. Especially since if as you pointed out a subscriber would need to save up all his crowns to purchase the DLCs to safeguard against losing access by letting his membership lapse.Look I would love to see the subscription base for this game stay strong or increase after the switch to BP. Constant income from a large subscription base would help keep this game going strong for years and make everyone happy. Because of that I would think it would make the most sense to offer a highly attractive incentive package to subscribers. Unfortunately if general consensus is any indicator the current benefits arent perceived as being worth the cost of the subscription.For me personally I really want to keep subscribing after . simply because I love the game and want to show my support of the Devs. But all that aside I cant help feeling that I will be kicking myself in a year if there hasnt been any new content driven DLC or it costs the lions share of my crowns to buy it.,elderscrollsonline,co5di8v,0,t5_2tqi0

Flame clench is really only for CC it will get better in .. Elemental ring is stronger AoE than Elemental Wall but requires high destro staff skill to obtain.Summarizing DK synergy with a destro staff is veru good but also utilizes class skills.

2997410,0,t3_2uihrn,For the early dungeons its as easy aswhoever has aggro usually the tank vs bosses everyone vs trashmobs permanently hold block and use skills.On top of that ball up and the healer uses the first skill from the restoration staff line to heal everybody for low cost. Tanks can pick the bigger threats everybody should get out of red AoEs but for the early dungeons thats not even necessary. PermaBlock is really everything you need.LightHeavy attacks are for when you have no aggro at all usually during bossfights and will increase your dps a lot. That being said you can do a lot of things in ESO with diverse builds etc. Healing in Heavy armor is questionnable but there are many many players who dont skill the armor passives until a bit later where there are pelty skillpoints that still do fine. And without passives heavy armor is the best thing you can wear. Healing early dungeons really REQUIRES a restoration staff though. the first skill is THE best group heal in the game and by far the best heal per magicka. On top of that resotration heavy attacks can recharge you magicka.One more thing about the you can be everythingthing. Thats true to some extend espeically for solo play. For dungeons espeically later it usually mean that you can equip different skills and items can decide if you want to be a tank dps or healer during that run. Personally I think its a great idea to play some kind of hybrid but when entering a dungeon switch to one specialized role as templar you currently can easily be a tank or healer competetive dps is not really strightforward right now. ,elderscrollsonline,co8oglo,3,t5_2tqi0

3050776,0,t3_2v1d4m,At first I was like wtf thy wont work but upon reading your entire article I can say that Im totally for this idea. Lore wise there are several mortals that have done this. Like the pocket dimension evyea from mages guild quest line. I can see players doing some quest for a more power Magedaedra and the reward being your own little pocket of oblivion. And the possibilities for content are great Ive personally spent lots of time in other mmos just making and getting stuff for my house. Adding furniture skins and whatnot into the crown store would be a great way to bring in extra revenue as opposed to motifs.  The crafting skills could easily be implemented for making things woodworking for furniture clothing for curtains sheets rugs etc. black smithing for furniture a made of metal and to make personalize crafting stations. I think that customizable terrain would be cool but it might be more do able with several presets as opposed to complete customization it would be easier to implement and cause less stress on many peoples pc if they dont have a high end gaming rig cuz lets face it not everyone is good at design and many will probably throw too many objects into their realm but thats just a thought.One other thing to consider maybe guild houses guilds themselves could own their own pocket and members could donate money to the cause collaboratively collect the resources necessary with the guild master being able to assign who can edit the house and who can visit. With this regular players could purchase their own regular cookie cutter houses and guilds themselves have the customizable stuff.,elderscrollsonline,coe7m10,3,t5_2tqi0

Either an enemy is taunted or it isnt  and if it isnt itll go after whoever it wants regardless of damage being done or the healing spells being thrown around. I know from personal experience that just doing damage to a monster doesnt keep its attention it can and will wander off to attack someone else. Ive also never heard of the group leader being the first on the block so that may just be random chance on your part.I also know however that in ESO the tank is not expected to hold everyones attention all the time forever. You hold the biggest or most dangerous foes attention  its up to everyone else to stay alive from the lesser dudes. This means the healer has to be able to stay out of AoEs block and take some amount of damage.If youre having trouble Deltia has a nice guide for the dungeons bosses maybe thatll help.Good hunting friend!,elderscrollsonline,coekis7,4,t5_2tqi0

3206840,0,t3_2wv41z,The biggest upside is that the guild store system makes it much much harder for anyone to manipulate the market. In games with global auction houses a single wellheeled player with a knack for speculation can drive prices up to skyscraper levels on certain items making themselves ever richer and effectively putting even basic things out of reach for newer and poorer players. But in a game with multiple guild stores and a limit on the number of guilds a single account can join its significantly harder for a single player to have such a disproportionate impact on the game economy. That said one risk in going buytoplay is that the market manipulators will have cheaper access to more than  guilds and hackers will find ways to take advantage of that access to profit from market manipulation. It will still though be much harder than in globalauctionhouse games. My only serious gripe with the current system is the appalling lack of a text search function. To launch a game without such a core feature is sloppy. For the feature still to be lacking nearly a year later is inexcusable. ,elderscrollsonline,coudz0i,3,t5_2tqi0

3402992,0,t3_2z5nms,To answer your question about Tank and Healer nightblades ESOs system of character build is VERY fluid compared to standard MMOs.Nightblades sound and look like Rogues but you can utilize their self healing and evasiveness for a Tank build or their skills with siphoning health from enemies for a Healer.You see the game has six Weapon skill sets and three Armor types plus a large number of skills related to NPC guilds dungeons and PVP that are universal between all characters. So any Nightblade can equip a sword and shield or a Restoration staff train in their use by questing and combat and develop themselves into a Tank or a Healer instead of a DPS if they wish to do so.

Those who hate it because they followed the herd way back when and are now to stubborn to admit they were wrong and secretly like the game but are too scared to face the people who they said the game was bad to due to their ego and the missing out.. Those who cant stand not to be the centre of attention in game kind of like a child who keeps calling out for attention but does not get it as they realize their character is far less important then those in a single player game so they hate it for that. Those who do not like dealing with idiots these people dont actually hate ESO just the fact they have to play alongside people they would regard as idiots however this shows they think themselves superior which honestly is the kind of person most would not want to play with anyway..

LGBT groups usually dont exclude heterosexual people. At least most of the ones Ive seen havent. While saying that a guild is LGBT friendly does should mean that youre opposed to bigotry and sexism saying LGBT friendly just kind of specifically addresses those concerns. As for stop black on black crime I dont think thats supposed to say anything about any other type of crime. Its specifically about crime in primarily black communities where black on white and white on black crime might be less common than black on black simply because its mostly black people there.

Change your graphics settings around. Drop your firewall.

My statement is based on observance of classes Ive ran dungeons with and more importantly the logic of player class selection decisions based on factionrace limitations and the best passive racial bonuses for each class.  For example There are more dunmer dragon knights then any other race because they have the best racials for dragon knights.  There are more pact dunmber than other factions because not everyone has the anyraceanyfaction capability purchased.Also I meant to say that daggerfall has the most templars not AD.

To get the gold key you have to defeat the boss doing something special that makes the fight harder. Like keeping a certain number of adds alive before killing the boss stuff like that. Definitely makes the fight more interesting.Hundings Rage is a crafted set that the  piece bonus gives a huge bonus to weapon damage. Great for stamina based DPS. SW rings are PVP only rings that come in V and also give weapon damage.

We can fight huge battles and never have lag. We come across your group and bam! The game becomes unplayable EVERY TIME. Now im in a summit DC guild. We have talks with ZoS almost monthly were we submit reports and have meetings over TS with them.  They have hinted to us that there is a problem with certain guilds  but they cant prove anything yet.  We are trying to figure out what the issue is and we are getting close. When the same people in your guild do the same systematic rotation of skillsspells no mater what the scenario is shows that there is something fishy going on.  When the same players are the ones left standing all the time still doing those rotations even adds more emphasis to foul play.  When i encounter that one or two players from your guild solo and they still do that rotation and lag everyone around them out it becomes a no brainer.  Maybe your guildies arnt doing it on purpose but from where we all stand things dont add up and it doesnt paint your guild in a good light. ,elderscrollsonline,cr8qryw,9,t5_2tqi0

When TTK is already too low introducing things like increased siege damage is a move in the wrong direction. I would also argue that zergs have gotten larger and more prevalent since the siege damage was increased.  Now numbers are the only effective counter to a keep with heavy siege defense.   So people either zerg or nightcap.  The groups that are able to accomplish objectives without resorting to either of those tactics are few and far between.

4167141,0,t1_cruy8rl,This is great feedback.I chose Breton for Aesthetic reasons as well as their magicka bonuses paired with the Sorcerer magicka bonuses allow me to focus all gear enchants on stamina. Breton Sorcerer and Light armor passives along with Energy Overload give me plenty of magicka resource management.As for gear I was trying to get more Weapon Damage as opposed to Max Stamina. Of course I dont know the conversion rates but am assuming straight damage would give a higher value than max stamina. I do like the suggested Night Silence and Shadow Walker sets though.Rally or Surge Surge or Rally. Im really just using this skill for the Major Brutality buff. I like having this ability use magicka so I can focus my stamina on damage abilities. I do understand that Rally is just a better utility skill with the longer duration and better heal. Ive gone back and forth on this one a lot. I like being able to use Surge on my Overload bar though. Still a toss up in my mind but I dont disagree with your assessment. Im trying to stick with H both for thematic reasons and for conserving skill points by using only  weapon type. Dont worry though I am leveling other weapons just trying to keep points out of them for the time being while I level a few crafting professions.I do really like your DW bar setup.Thanks again for the feedback!,elderscrollsonline,crv9g38,1,t5_2tqi0

Build X may do  more damage than build Y but build Y might survive better or buff the team more.  Its very hard to a say a build is optimized in this game just because combat is fairly complex and surviviability as DPS fall a lot more on the shoulders of that player than the healer unlike some other MMOs.You do get people who want to heal in plate armor which doesnt really work.

Overload does not require very much ultimate and it only consumes ultimate on a per attack basis   ulti for a light attack and  for each tick of the heavy attack. Follow your zerg of choice preferably one with healers and pick off enemies from range with your single target abilities. Once you hit about  ulti youve built up enough beastmode reserves to unleash phase  of the Zergstomper.PHASE   FINAL FORMHit R. You will sheath your staff and begin radiating electricity. Use this electricity in conjunction with bound armaments mage light and restraining prison to hit everything in a  meter radius around you for  dps. Since youll have a  spell crit chance on targets that have been prisoned and critical surge heals you for  of critical damage inflicted you will also be healing for ridiculous numbers. You will also have enough magicka to keep boundless storm up indefinitely overcharging your spell resist.Note that this entire build takes up only one weapon swap since using Overload gives you a separate skillbar.

I havent touched any of the main story fighters  or Mage quest lines since the first one. Right now Im level  and just started in the Rift Ill most likely ding  before Im done and then go do the main quest.

Open from stealth of course.Heavy attack gt Funnel health gt cloak gt  medium attack gt crippling grasp gt cloak close gap now using movement speed buff gt cloak gt medium attack gt concealed weapon. If they arent dead by this point cloak again and incapacitating strike. Rinse and repeat. Always try to attack from cloak. They enemy cant kill you if they cant see you and you get  dmg increase. Apply degeneration if you dont burst them down. Double take and harness magicka need to be up all the time as well.I only use lotus fan over teleport strike because I dont use it as a damage skill. I use it to gap close and snare before clouding swarm  prox. detonation. It is extremely effective. I dont use magelight it is a waste of bar space and crit stacking doesnt count for much anymore. If you are being attacked from stealth you need to be very very fast on dark cloak. It is your only hope of surviving stam NB burst. Cloak is love cloak is life.

Yes some are playing because its elder scrolls and they want the story but from my experience they tend to stick to solo.becoming good means learning what to look for. Old MMOs on PC you looked for numbers new console MMO you look for sound and visual cues its the same process just one take more skills and thus a larger gap between good and bad players.  MMO vet or not you must learn the specific games cues to become good text sound or visual. No where did i say fuck the disabled and I personally think game designers should put more time into such considerations but in limited timefunds only so much can be done and sadly this is something that is most often overlooked even color blind which effects a reasonably large percent of there player base is normally neglected till after a game is released and more time is available.

Personally I dont regret my decision one bit. TESO gave me a new perspective that WoW was lacking. There is such a rich story to TESO quests. Each quest chain provides the player with a new set of opportunities to become familiar with the characters. The amount of customization is quite phenomenal too. If you are a graphic fanatic you will not be disappointed! Looking back I spent about ..  just on subscription fees alone for WoW! Im really happy I spent the initial  and have so much content at my fingertips. Best of all I dont feel pressured to work around the  day subscription fee before Im charged another month. Granted there is the Xbox Live requirement to play but thats a small fee for the amount of entertainment you are offered! Hope this persuades you a bit.

4428713,1,t3_3bruzp,I want text chat more than any other feature that could possibly be added to this game. If they asked me right now if I wanted text chat or infinite stamina on my stamina build character id say text chat. Game feels broken without it. You say text chat feels lonely but id say the opposite. I barely ever hear anyone speak on this game and ive spent well over  hours since its release on PS. I try to get people to communicate during dungeons and they say nothing at all. I believe a lot of people have anxiety and wont talk. I also think others just flat out dont want to actually talk on a game because despite what some will say its more of a hassle to use a headset and mic than to simply type if we had text chat. I mean think about it. How many people would rather get texts on their phone than have someone call them? I hate when i just simply want to address someone through texts and they call. In my opinion text chat has several technical advantages over only having VC and only having VC has no technical advantages over text chat at all. Ive seen only one post by a zenimax rep addressing the whole leaving text chat out and they listed reason  being they found that typing on a controller was difficult  ignorance at its finest. You can use a keyboard your consoles official app or even a controller attachment mini usb kb to type with. Its like they did no research at all because if they did they would see that there are already several console mmosmmorpgs that successfully utilize text chat  FF? DCUniverse?  and it works just fine.,elderscrollsonline,csoxh1x,1,t5_2tqi0

Its a toggle ability in mages guild that ups your spell crit to around  .I have it on both bars so once I toggle it on it stays on when I switch weapons. You lose  magika but its more than worth it for the damage gain. Also you can morph it later and actually gain magika . I recommend getting it asap and morphing it to inner light as soon as you can.Also theres a skill on destruction staff called weakness to elements its got a different name on console I think it reduces the targets spell resistance.

4504429,0,t3_3cpfg2,The group finder is a nightmare. I played for months on PC as a DPS character and would spend hours hopelessly trying to join a group. There are multiple dungeons my PC character never completed and I never even started a veteran dungeon despite my best efforts. My problem was always finding a group in the first place. On the rare occasions I succeeded there was no issue on getting the four into the dungeon proper. But that was PC.A group of my friends bought the game on Xbox and I jumped at the chance to buy it again despite missing the character transfer period because it would mean I would get to do the dungeons. I even made a healer assuming most of my friends would be DPS and thinking that it would help when Im trying to find groups when alone.The problem is unchanged. At first I was delighted to see so many players everywhere on Xbox  I never saw such a quantity when leveling on PC  and I thought it would mean people would be using the group finder. Mais non.Thankfully I have friends on Xbox and we have managed to do every dungeon on normal mode all but one or two with just three players. Now Ive hit VR and only one other friend has hit VR Im encountering the same issues as on PC with finding groups. I heal and he tanks so we need  dps players to try the veteran pledges so together we sit in the group finder. For hours.At one point yesterday a third player joined and after another  minutes of waiting we decided to try the veteran dungeon with three. But it was too hard and our group went back down to two.When trying to find dungeons alone and I have found three other players Ive experienced the same problems as others here. I tend to jump immediately to the dungeon so if any are confused at least they can select my name and travel to player.Once yesterday I queued for a veteran dungeon found a group and travelled there. Unfortunately two others had travelled to the normal version of the dungeon and the other guy quit out immediately. I jumped to the other guys and explained my issue but nobody uses chat so I eventually quit as well  I didnt want to do the dungeon on normal mode and hadnt queued for that.When still going through the dungeons on normal I would always do my factions one before queuing for the two other factions dungeons simultaneously. A couple of times when doing this I would find a group but they would jump to the dungeon I had finished and had specifically NOT been searching for.If you do search to join any dungeon or multiples the message which states which dungeon the game has put you in a group for is ridiculously brief. Some in the group might have just been searching for one dungeon and therefore its important for the others to know which dungeon they should be heading for. The only way to find out is to wait for others to travel there and see their locations in the group menu.Its such a mess. I wrote this while waiting in the group finder.,elderscrollsonline,csyfnjg,1,t5_2tqi0

I love NonVet PvP what I dont love is being at a disadvantage just because I dont grind as much as the next guy.... The thing is the idea behind the BattleLeveling system is truly wonderful.

Or are buff servers not a thing anymore? I havent ventured into Cyrodiil for over a couple of months so Im not sure.

4603448,0,t3_3e2hfg,i can answer most of your questions regarding classesany class can play any role pretty effectively. use a skill calculator like ESO skill to view the skills available to each class and decide which class you like the most. dont be afraid to play weird things like nightblade tanks or healing dragonknights as anything is viable. nightblades have great self sustain if you build them around magicka but the more magicka you invest in the more they play like mages. you might be interested in something known as a sap tank which revolves around lots of self healing while still dishing out reasonable damagedragonknights also have great self sustain and dont play like mages unless you invest heavily in magicka. they are naturally a tankier class through their skills and i think you would like this class the best personallytemplars also have good self sustain mages are basically the only class without some form of healing skills so once again check out those skill trees. feel free to ask if you have specific questions i cant post many links while i am at work however web filtering,elderscrollsonline,ctaunz6,1,t5_2tqi0

4605134,0,t1_ctb1t2b,no goal post moving Ultima was launched back in  and has switched hands several times since EA took over Origin the game has changed drastically.  When its brought up in convos most people just assume oldschool UO it does get brought up on reddit very often nostalgia strong! including private server launches but I understand you didnt get into mmos until later and now Im feeling old lol. If UO is foreign then think about EvE.  Player generated conflict drama story is limitless vs a themepark setup but I dont like spaceships and spreadsheet combat personally sorry EvE point being though just because theres not more quests to do doesnt mean people quit if theres dynamic content players can actively be participating in to drive their own stories.  But yeah when they fix battle buff that will help it is and has been a point for awhile now though its not gone yet and it currently forces low VR players to miss out on that portion of the game unless you like being terribly weak.,elderscrollsonline,ctb29ui,1,t5_2tqi0
4605435,0,t3_3e34gy,Completely agree.  Running dungeons in groups has become one of my favorite things to do in this game.  Voice chat makes it way easier to work together and Ive met a lot of people from doing this.  Its also useful to head to crafting areas in the major cities in your levels zone and use area chat to recruit players for dungeons.  This is how Ive grouped up for every dungeon and its never taken me more than  minutes to find a group.  Everyone Ive grouped up with has been really cool and patient and willing to learn the dungeons.ampnbspAnd just wait until you get to the vet dungeons.  They get WAY harder and communication is absolutely necessary. My first vet dungeon run some group members were getting frustrated but we analyzed our strategy tried some new things and were able to complete it.

4605824,0,t1_ctb4n4u,Yea. Theyre bringing it over for FO. Its going to be extremely limited though. What theyre doing is sorting through PC mods and picking the ones that they find suitable for consoles. Console players wont be able to just go get any mod. Things like ENBs and such wont be possible. Basically anything that makes the game look better at the cost of performance wont be approved since consoles all out out the same power and are limited to that power. Itll likely only be things like additional content like custom quests. Even that is a great step forward though. Most people are looking at it as a conversion tool above anything. Believe it or not many console players think that mods and hacks and cheats are the same thing. Showing off the potential of what modding can do will have a pretty big impact on people moving to PC. I agree though. People should play wherever they want as long as theyre happy with the experience and are having fun. ,elderscrollsonline,ctb5dz3,3,t5_2tqi0

4689690,0,t1_ctlm0nu,So its fair that my faction has twice as many keeps  outposts  resources as another and we have some elder scrolls and they have none yet they get twice as many points and theyre only down  population bar?  We get pushed into third place despite doing better.  Meanwhile EP has first place because they take the map every night against an empty server.  No part of that seems fair.I do agree there should be a way for low pop to catch up but low pop is crushing a slightly higher pop and really wed have to take and hold the entire map just to even out the scores we get with every tick.  They passed us because of these scoring mechanics.  Meanwhile EP had full pop this whole time and wasnt just standing around.  These scoring mechanics made it impossible for us to keep second place without taking the entire map against a full EP pop and  AD pop.  Thats not fair.They should not boost faction scores for low pop they should scale down point gains for resources  keeps  outposts scrolls held by winning factions depending on how much population they are against.  This way taking the map against an empty server would be minimal points as it should be and the territory we held wouldnt be as rewarding in the scenario last night at the same time we shouldnt find ourselves moving from nd to rd place when were doing better.Im sure DC does this sometimes too still doesnt make it right.,elderscrollsonline,ctlofwq,0,t5_2tqi0

4698827,0,t3_3faht0,. This already exists. You can shift click to set waypointsping the map on PC. Everyone sees it. As for console I am unsure.. This could cause for an awful lot of clusterfuck in the quest window and right now the quest window only accommodates focusing a single quest at a time. Maybe down the line this will change but is it really so awful to have to communicate about this sort of thing? I dont see it as a highpriority change.. Who knows? It isnt really too much of a bother. Ive hardly had a quest along those lines take any significant amount of time even when Ive been duoquestingleveling from  to V so far.. Might as well not have an inventory system then. Honestly this is why inventory expansions and bank expansions exist. Spend some offtime stealing or doing crafting dailies for cash and hop in to a good trading guild to sell your stuff. Raw crafting mats go easily and for a nice chunk of change. No real problems here if you ask me and theyre giving us more bank and bag slots when Imperial City arrives.. No. Absolutely not. For starters half of the quests in this game involve walking near them to discover them. Teleporting from place to place without any set limit essentially deprives the player of this unknowingly and also invalidates half of the massive game world ZOS has given us. Honestly speed up your mount a bit if its such an issue. Not to mention being dropped at a wayshrine is a way better alternative if youre just using someone on your buddy list or guild list to teleport to a zone. Even if its the wrong wayshrine it lessens the load if you have to teleport a second time and you also are able to just do a  turn on the spot and use the shrine.,elderscrollsonline,ctmtr65,2,t5_2tqi0

I keep my DOTs up I keep my resources up I keep their damage low I CC them often and when they let their health drop below  I can spam execute.

A Spammable attack just leads people to the mistake of depleting their stamina and being left with nothing when they need to CC break dodge execute apply a DoT use a buff etc. Id rather be able to react and do those on command than have a spammable attack in a campaign where everyone has k Health.,elderscrollsonline,ctuzzw8,1,t5_2tqi0

You are yelling over  other people followed by Who said that? who said they need a tank?. Its an absolute clusterfuck.

At least for now next month their will be some changes in scoring in different campaigns.  Some are nonvet only some are for everyone.You can always leave via the wayshrine back to PvE.  If you dont like your home campaign you can pay K alliance points to change it not as expensive as you might think or you can guest in a different campaign and switch it every  days.  If you dont like your home or guest campaign you can join your buddies by grouping with them and traveling to a group member in Cyrodil its a way to sneak into a campaign that isnt your home or guest but you can only get back by doing the same thing.,elderscrollsonline,ctz7rh3,1,t5_2tqi0

Telling people to switch to PC just for text chat is laughable and not reasonable at all.  Just go buy a gaming PC and start your character over if you want text chat dude! simple as that!.  Youre arguments are completely unreasonable and hypothetical.  People who use mics will also use text chat.

Personally I think it might be cool if player housing coluld be bought with achievement points rather than gold or AP.   A skooma buff that overuse leads to addiction.

Ive been in plenty of vs and have noticed when people use finishers on me and Ive always either use conjured ward or healing ward and pretty much it doesnt work even though Im at like  health. I have yet to see a finisher work on someone with shielda up and their health really low. It shouldnt work anyways since the finisher would hit the shield first rather than hitting the target and the  bonus wouldnt go off since it assumes the target is at full health when its really not. ,elderscrollsonline,cu57hix,1,t5_2tqi0

4872779,0,t3_3hmqsj,UESP and the Imperial Library have all the info you need. I can also explain some of the basics The universe was created when two cosmic forces came together  Anu and Padomay the forces of Order and Chaos. They then gave birth to their own souls  Anuiel and Sithis who then created the Aurbis or the Wheel of Time or simply the Universe. Eventually Anuiel and Sithis gave rise to the etAda or Gods. Initially Nirn and its planetary system did not yet exist. Mundus the realm of existence Nirn and its moons and neighbouring planets are in was created when the god Lorkhan tricked the other etAda into creating it but the etAda would have to give a significant amount of power to create Mundus  which they didnt know about. This event was known as the Great Construction. Some of the etAda gave parts of themselves entirely in the creation of Mundus and those types of etAda are called the Aedra. There are eight surviving Aedra who assisted in the creation of Mundus  Akatosh Arkay Dibella Kynareth Stendarr Zenithar Mara and Julianos. Most of the Aedra evolved into the Earthbones which gave rise to life on Nirn. Not all etAda agreed to create Mundus. These etAda became the infinite Daedric Princes such as Molag Bal and Meridia. They arent all inherently bad  they are only called Daedra because they did not create Mundus. Most of them would love to see Mundus destroyed though. Magnus became disgusted at Lorkhans trickery and he fled back through to Aetherius ripping a hole in spacetime that eventually became Nirns sun  also called Magnus after its creator. Thousands upon thousands more followed Magnus back to Aetherius ripping smaller holes in spacetime that became the stars. Akatosh also known in Elvish as Auriel killed Lorkhan in a cosmic standoff. Akatosh then ripped his heart out and shot it towards Mundus which created the mighty Red Mountain. The Heart of Lorkhan is one of the most legendary artefacts on Nirn and it was responsible for the extinction of the Dwemer race who crafted powerful tools from the heart and used them causing them all to vanish from existence. The Ehlnofey were the first race to walk on Nirn. A split eventually occurred and today we see Men Elves and Beasts. Nirn has existed for at least  years and  Eras  the Merethic Era The first era after creation the First Era the Second Era when ESO takes place the Third Era and the Fourth Era. The Fifth Era has also been described by a controversial Bethesda writer but most fans do not think its canon. The Fifth Era apparently involves the destruction of Nirn in an event known as Landfall when all of The Towers are destroyed causing the planet to fall apart and causing everyone to live on Nirns moons.If you want to learn more dont hesitate to ask ,elderscrollsonline,cu8r2cx,9,t5_2tqi0

Thats    which means that damage on them would be reduced by th.You do need to chose between a stamina weapon or magicka spell build. Any class can do stamina or magicka. Stamina generally has better damage output while magicka has more versatility and utility most crowd controls and all but  heal are magicka based. Pick whichever synergies with your race... Redguards imperials and possibly woodelves are excellent for stamina while High Elves Bretons and Dunmers really only use these for a magickaDK build are good for magic.There is no ideal amount of regen but stack it as high as possible. Cost reduction enchants on jewlery tend to be better than regen enchants by a lot. If forced to chose between regen and max picking max pools is usually better but you wont come across this choice much except in armour sets.Get crafted armour sets ASAP.

4916347,0,t3_3i7lrs,In endgame PVE having  base magicka regen  with potion is almost endless.  Having more is just a waste.  A lot of the top damage builds run around with  magicka regen  with potion.  These builds heavily rely on CP and group members to help sustain magicka.  If you go from a  base regen build to a  base regen build you will notice a significant difference.  Without group support you will run out of mana very fast.In PVP its beneficial to have a ton of magicka regen such as  or higher.  Your damage may be a little lower but you will never ever run out of magicka.  Some players run high burst low regen builds.  If you can survive their initial onslaught they are very vulnerable and much easier to kill.Once you hit VR you should aim for k health.

4956085,0,t3_3ishoa,Your first three skill points should go into your classs main skill lines. An ability from a specific tree only needs to be equipped on your bar to gain experience for that line its not based on use of the skill. Go join up with the mages guild and fighters guild as soon as you can. The guilds unlock skill lines that contain useful perks and other abilities. Definitely invest a point into both the persuasion perk mages guild and the intimidation perk fighters guild.Also pick one or two crafting lines to invest in and start working early! Researching traits requires a lot of time. Dont waste gold buying any gear early on youll progress fast enough at low levels that gear doesnt stay very long. You can start training your riding speed stamina or carrying capacity at any stable BEFORE you have even gotten your first mount. If you decide to venture forth into PvP stick to the NonVeteran campaigns. Sky shards are super important keep an eye out! Oh and just open the urn.

Amended the Milegates at Fort Ash and Chalman Keep to allow you to venture onto the third level via scaffolding and other makeshift stairs. Fixed an issue where the Campaign Reward Tier bar would briefly appear full when first viewing the Alliance War Scoring. Fixed an issue where all Elder Scroll and Emperorship bonus tooltips displayed the incorrect bonus text. You will no longer become stuck in a falling animation when moving into the corners of certain keep towers. Adjusted the note next to Aldmeri bounty boards to allow easier interaction with the bounty board. Adjusted various tradeskill nodes books and gatherable objects to be interactable once again. Melee guards will no longer stun themselves when bashing with their shields. Archer guards will no longer stun themselves when performing power shots. The Release Ownership text will now correctly display Keep names. Incoming friendly attacks from siege weapons will no longer display their telegraph since they do not damage you. This is to provide clarity on which incoming attacks should be avoided. Postern doors on keeps and keep doors will no longer have a halfsecond delay after you interact with them. Note that you will still be able to interact with doors while in combat. You can no longer get to an Elder Scroll unless youve broken through the Scroll Keep Gate. Thorons Orders have again been moved further away from the bounty board. You can now wear the Emperors Regalia at any time after receiving it. Fixed an issue where you could no longer control a siege weapon if it was initially placed on top of fire. Fixed an issue where the bosses in Cyrodiils many caves were dropping level  gear even when you were Veteran Ranked. They will now drop gear up to VR. Removed the counter for Siege NPCs on the Cyrodiil map as Mercenaries are no longer used.ampnbspItemization Added a selection of useful potions food and drink to the Siege vendors in Cyrodiil.     These items can only be purchased with Alliance Points.     Though better than the consumables found from monsters vendors and treasure chests elsewhere in the game they are still inferior to consumables crafted by other player characters. Updated the Rewards for the Worthy so the set items in those mails will now only come in blue or purple qualities.     Note The overall chance to get a set item has not changed but the chance to get a blue or a purple has each increased. The Rewards for the Worthy set items are now all Bind on Equip. Siege Repair Kits can now be purchased with gold from Daggerfall and Ebonheart merchants in Cyrodiil matching their Aldmeri counterparts. Fixed an issue where Scattershot Catapults were more expensive from Aldmeri vendors than from Daggerfall or Ebonheart vendors. The Aldmeri vendors have had their price reduced to match.,elderscrollsonline,culy1ld,6,t5_2tqi0

Youre stuck with one weapon and one skill bar at  you get access to the ability to swap two different weapons and skill bars.  . of the people youre going to see out there?  Theyve got  bars meaning twice the options you have.  Take that for what its worth.Also skill points.  You need them.  Your abilities and resource pools will scale up but the number of abilities youll have will be hampered as well as a severe lack of passive abilities.  Youll pick them up along the way but if youre dead set on not playing the PvE aspect of the game I would suggest checking out which quests are storyline important and will reward you with skill points and just blitzing through them.  Gear well you can grind points to buy PVP gear.  Or you can use quest reward gear.  Or you can buy gear.  Or you can craft gear.  Tradeskilling in this game is very easy but it does become resource intensive.  However only crafters can upgrade gear to better qualities.  Either youll do it yourself or youll pay somebody else.  No matter how you cut it its up to you how you proceed.Yes you can reset your points.  That costs gold but it also means that you can bounce between builds.So in a nutshell no PVP is not just for VR or VR.  But theyll have an advantage or two over the new guy.

5038881,0,t3_3jy2ny,Theres only two megaservers. US and Euro.Factions dont matter. You will get quite similar opportunities with everyone.Just gain levels to your skills and when you complete IV you can morph them and go to IV again. After that you should consider swapping to another skill so youll have as many skill lines complete for easy respec. For example I did restodestro staves until veteran ranks. Then i took hshield to my main weapon bar and have it almost maxed by vr. Now I slot dual wield skills in my nd bar so I gain passively levels to them and can respec into them. Just by having them slotted and opening chests and completing quests give you exp towards them.So try everything and respec later.When you arrive to your first town go to Mages Guild and open up that quest line same for Undaunted and Fighters Guild. Mages Guild furthers by reading lore books Undaunted with dungeons Fighters Guild by killing daedraundeadcompleting dark anchors.Search for Sorcerer builds. Start with e.g. Crystal Shard Mages Fury and any of the summoning skills because you want Bound Armor andor Conjured Ward later on. Then add Daedric Curse into the mix.For example at some point one good combo is  Curse  Entropy  Force Shock  Crystal Fragments usually instant cast thanks to Force Shock  again starting from Curse ,elderscrollsonline,cutdk3q,1,t5_2tqi0

5109907,0,t3_3kz001,Since the game allows you to make  characters at a time just make  characters of each class  one for magicka and one for stamina  for instance I have a dunmer DK and a redguard DK. Then you dont have to lose any progress and can level them sidebyside to compare the fun factor which is largely subjective. Additionally this will allow you to test out different morphs without respecing. Of course leveling then takes twice the time but if its the experience youre after itll be rich.I agree with previous posters in that it is essential to get past level  before passing judgment on a build. In fact for many skill lines the best abilities are the last or second to last to unlock which could take till the upper s!

H is slightly better for Stamina DPS than DW and both of those beat Bow. But I like having Bow with a melee option. Thats for stamina.For Magicka builds theres a lot out there. Id personally recommend since youre already a Vampire running a magicka build. Youll use either DWResto Staff or DestroResto most likely. Both work well. Check out deltiasgaming.com for his Umbra build its an awesome Magicka build for NBs. I think youll enjoy it.You will need maxed Siphoning though.

5203535,0,t1_cvd62tn,I can tell you my stamina NB tank build. VR so far so not its final form yet but I run MH  pieces undaunted bastion  pieces deaths wind. At V I will use  piece twin sisters  piece footmans. hander and hshield. Skillsh Brawler Inner Fire Surprise Attack Mirage Rally | Soul TetherhS Pierce Armour Defensive Stance Refreshing Path Siphoning Attacks Killers Blade | Veil of BladesIt has been pretty effective since switching from DPS becuase my guild was down a tank but this build with an even split between health and stam was performing great while still doing good damage. Was able to tank Bogdan the Nightflame in vet Elden Hollow with a similarly leveled team.Key is to keep up all your  main buffs Rally Mirage and Siphoning Attacks which will give you dodge chance healing minor armour and massive resource gain on light attacks. Then you want to be using a shadow skill every  seconds or so in order to maintain your shadow barrier major armour and major spell resist passive  this is easily achieved with refreshing path  veil of blades  surprise attack. Your hS bar is mainly for heavy tanking and taking on bosses your h bar does great damage especially vs groups using brawler and surprise attack and also has the emergency inner fire taunt when you need to get an enemy off a teammate. High stamina and good regen means you can use Rally with regularity as a self heal so your healer isnt pressured as much.Very fun build overall would recommend giving it a try.

5206376,0,t1_cvdb15v,Experience points are pretty easy to come by its not a long tedious grind to get to VR or accumulate champion points. You never really get frustrated into buying experience scolls. For the glass motif however there only are the two options of long tedious grind either for fragments or gold to buy chapters or spending crowns.And that to me is the problem here the frustration of long tedious grinds. Once there are too many of them players will start to leave because they feel like are forced to spend real money to achieve any meaningful progress. Oh its only cosmetics you might say but the people who are into cosmetics as well as completionists are the ones who are faced with the dilemma of having to buy the motifs with the crowns theyd rather spend on pets and mounts other pure cosmetics. And one day they might just get fed up with having to choose all the time and thats the day when ESO will loose paying customers. You have to keep that in mind the people who buy cosmetics are the ones generating most of the revenue and if they get milked too much compared to people who dont care about cosmetics theyll leave.This isnt really about what you or I focus on and like in the game this is about the health of the game itself which is ultimately in the interest of everyone here.,elderscrollsonline,cvdk75y,1,t5_2tqi0

5212940,0,t3_3megh0,Stamina Sorc is hard to pull off.   Bow isnt the hardest hitting thing either.  You would have to stack stamina and weapon damage to make it work.  Part of the problem is that you are only VR.  Magicka or stamina its going to be hard not to feel like you are hitting for cotton balls. You need about k spell damage as a magicka sorc or about .K weapon damage as stamina to feel like you are hitting hard.  Not sure you can get that on VR.  You might just have to grind a bit.But if you wanted to try it put all of your attributes into stamina slot snipe on your bow bar and put ALL sorc skills in every other slot on that bar.  One of these skills should be bound armaments ult should be flawless dawnbreaker.  It takes both bars but gives you  stamina boost.   This will pump up your snipe power as much as possible as every sorcerer skill slotted increases both your spell and weapon damage.  Because of the way weapon damage scales differently it makes a bigger effect on weapon damage.  ,elderscrollsonline,cvecp0v,1,t5_2tqi0

5502239,0,t3_3qg0q8,Okay first steps after you open your eyes to the wonders that is Tamriel.  First do some reading.  You want to decide what type of character you ENJOY playing.  For ESOTU that means Alliance Race Class Combat Role.  Read as much as needed to decide so you can then concentrate on ENJOYING playing that character.Heres a lot of the basicsESO Forums Basic GuideVideos Tamriel A to Z by Deltias GamingVeteran Wisdom for New Players by Tamriel FoundryESOAcademy WebsiteAnd heres some detailed build sites for whatever character you want to try.  Remember you have  character slots if what you start you dont like start another.  After you pick what you want to play.  Heres some first steps to set you on your way. Join as many guilds as you can to have people to help you and ask questions and also to be able to travel to guild members until you find all the zone wayshrines If you can get some gearweapons with training trait on it to quickly level that gearweapon type. Many Guilds will give new members free gearweapons. Go get all the safemostly safe Skyshards for your alliance zones. You can get them naked they are that safe. Just avoid enemies along the way. DC has  for  skill points AD  EP . Use all those free skill points to open up early skillspassives that will help you complete the quests along the way. If you do the zone quests and clear the zone dolmens and dungeonsdelves you will actually start over leveling each zone by a bit. Dont skip any enemies on the way to objectives all their XP adds up.  Then ifwhen you want to look into crafting heres the basicsFor BSWWCloth just decon everything you loot from kills. Take every weaponarmor that you can steal from racks less craft IP but free. Put all initial points in material level so you can move to the next higher material zone and continue stealing or killing what you can. Must be close to same skill level as material level to receive maximum deconcraft IP. You can level quickly with decon traded crafted items as well.For Alchemy  just run  or  zones worth of rivers and collect all the waters you come across. Then go to Coldharbor and run the Hollow City for herbs for a while the flowers are there without opening any of the city. Then just make potions with ANY  herbs that work you can eat one new herb at first for IPinfo or just check out the lists online. The leveling is based on the water level not the ingredients put your first skill points in water level and nothing else. Gather and make each higher water level as soon as you can with the same herbs that work. For the raw numbers Make  Natural Water  Clear Water  Pristine Water  Cleansed Water  Filtered Water  Purified Water Nonplusplus.For Provisioning you only need  recipes at LLLL foodbev level made. Steal or buy one of each and then just make   if PLUS subscribed of each level. Only apply points to Recipe Improvement only need  to level . Apply rest of points after L. Only make green  ingredient foodsbevs no extra IP for blue or purple. To get ingredients go to out of city barrelssackscontainers and Coldharbor no theft. For in cities find warehouses with closed doors and no inside guards and go wild. Some ships as well.For Enchanting there is no easy leveling other than decon higher than current skill level glyphs. You will just have to collect runes and make glyphs and decon loot glyphs or traded glyphs.Bottom line there are enough shard points to get a massive head start on crafting and combat leveling. WITH that head start you can then just levelexplore and have FUN while adding to your skill points and it will fly by quicker if you are enjoying the journey. Level  for combat is NOT hard you only need enough skills to kill what is in front of your objectives. BUT you need to concentrate on early skill level of the MAJOR skill trees that you plan on endgame using.Heres some Crafting Details sitesAnd if you want the raw numbers here they are  Finally if on PC you can get some basic addons that can make the game easier.  Use as much as you want SPOILERSDestinations  All kinds of locations marked on mapSkyshards  All those free skill pointsLuminary Teleporter  Fast Travel to any Guild Member from game map open,elderscrollsonline,cweynsx,16,t5_2tqi0

5536140,0,t3_3qxab3,gt What are Crowns for?Mainly for cosmetic additions like special mountspetscostumes. You can also buy some other items that you normally buy with gold with crowns. And of course dlcs as of now namely two Imperial City additional PvP area with a little bit different PvP playing style and Orsinium additional PvE area will be released on . You dont really need crowns especially in the beginning. You can still decide to get some later for the dlcs.gt Hows the story and combatgameplay? And most importantly is it fun?I think the best opinion on that you can get by watching some YouTube videos or Twitch. Just dont expect ESO to be like Skyrim or other TES games it obviously isnt the same. Ive been playing ESO since beta I started with some friends its my first MMO and I always was someone that said I wouldnt pay monthly for a game but well.. I did xD.

All of the other classes have better burst DPS or escape mechanisms or both which means you need to be  very good player or have some allies around if you venture off in Cyrodiil or the Imperial City.,elderscrollsonline,cwlirqo,1,t5_2tqi0
5555271,0,t1_cwligni,My opinion which is shared by some members of my guild is that if they would stop and fix the current problems I would be far more inclined to log in and  or subscribe. All I keep thinking about Orsinium is great more load screens to work through.   Last night we did vDSA two of our members got random disconnects and each of them contended with long load screens upon returning and we also had the problem with abilities not firing off as quickly as they should.   Such as weapon swap delay ultimates and potions which still need to have button spammed before they fire  consume etc.None of the new or upcoming or planned DLCs tickle my fancy.   I  refrain from logging in these days because I dont have a hell of a lot of time to spend during the weeknights and I dont want my time chewed up by simply logging in.

5578818,0,t1_cwocgew,Repentence is a great skill. I have it in my healing setup  of the time. Breath of Life is going to be your main life saver. Channelled Focus is great you get magicka and stamina return and extra defences. A healer should take extra care not to die since the whole group is reliant on you. Combat Prayer is another useful healing skill. Blazing Shards both morphs can be useful is great to keep your tanks stamina replenished. Elemental Drain likewise helps sustain magicka DDs. Look into alliance war skills like Warhorn and Barrier. Usually I have a healing and buffs bar with stuff like healing springs or combat prayer Repentence or Healing Ritual  Breath of Life Blazing Spear and Channelled Focus and a dps bar with elemental drain or Mystic Orb Undaunted line Crushing Shock as opposed to Force Pulse DDs often use Pulsar instead of Elemental Ring and Jesus Beam Radiant Oppression. Ill also use Dark Flare and Purifying Light sometimes. Ultimates I slot are Aggressive Warhorn and Nova Solar Prison. Youll note from the above that I dont have too much pure healing slotted. I keep people alive mostly through Breath of Life and sometimes healing springs and combat prayer when I need a mass heal. Most of my slotted skills are buffing allies andor helping sustain and debuffing enemies. Crushing Shock interrupts casters Pulsar knocks  HP off trash mobs. Healers keep people alive but they also must . Help sustain resources for everyone else . Buff and debuff . Top up group dps to finish fights quicker in this order of priority. ,elderscrollsonline,cwolrkt,1,t5_2tqi0

5650940,0,t3_3simzn,Well for a vet  its hard to talk about engame geardecision.What you can go for at any level because its crafted is  pieces of kagrenacs hope and  pieces of the seducers set. This is a farily good combo at vr aswell. When youre there you can use  pieces of willpower as accessoires.Another good combo for endgame though very expensive would be  pieces of kagrenacs  pieces of healers habit the rings are expensive if you take v legendary ones and one piece molag kena.For the DPS you should go with law of julianos set also craftable basically a mana hundings rage. Use dualwield that will give you a huge spelldamage boost. I run the following combination x julianos x archmage x molag kena. Hits like a truck.If you lack abit of money you can DPS with kagrenacs also though you cant equip x archmage then and have to go with torugs pact duals for example.,elderscrollsonline,cwxjy9r,2,t5_2tqi0

5660512,0,t1_cwyql5k,no i am half stamina half hp. you dont need full stamina because that skill i mentioned earlier that heals is boss as fuck and being able to take a hit or two is vital in close range. you block heal block heal when in a party often getting chances to rail bosses when they cast their fail AoE with your two handed sword. I also intend to rock  pieces of heavy and probably  medium if not  heavy.If you want full dps then sword and shield isnt for you but i think it is being up close is so much more involved when fighting and much more interesting. you also have that lightning move where you emit lightning and gain damage protection that has a stamina morph. GET IT. its amazing for stamina sorcerer and you can really take advantage of its damage output if you are a close ranger.with your two handed sword i advise having Cleave morphed into Brawler and Uppercut morphed into Wrecking Blow. Brawler generates a shield for yourself and lays down a damage over time effect on multiple foes at once and damages them of course at the start and Wrecking Blow when spammed over and over again is very high damage rate on one target not to mention stuns most stuff with the first hit  very satisfying.,elderscrollsonline,cwyqoly,1,t5_2tqi0

5686222,0,t3_3szfhs,Hey! you will be perfectly fine. ESO is not CPU heavy and any dedicated card will run ESO pretty fine.Im gonna give you real life example. When i was selling my GPU from PC i had to use for  days integrated graphic card from my processor Intel .Intel  is either rated in GPU benchmark as as good as Radeon Mobility  OR as slightly worse than it. And i was able to run ESO on that Intel  in full HD p in all details set to low with steady FPSThe game would then use approximately  GB of graphic ram i think its within the parameter of max memory that can be shared in laptop with GPU and was lightweight for the CPU.So in my opinion it will run fine on your laptop especially that its screen resolution is much lower than P. And with some fine tuning you should squeeze more than all settings low on it.Also you can buy imperial upgrade in game for some crowns  i think its around ? that will unlock for you Imperial class which is very cool its my biggest regret that i didnt bought it when i started playing game.,elderscrollsonline,cx1xix2,1,t5_2tqi0

5687025,0,t3_3sxfp8,Kinda makes me sad that racial passives lock you into playing a specific way for each race. You never see any stamina dk elves and stuff. Not every elf is a mage and not every kajiit is a sneaky night blade. They need to make it so you can pick from many different sets of passives after you pick your race. That would make character design much more unique because you could really play how you want to play and be who you want to be. ,elderscrollsonline,cx213yz,2,t5_2tqi0

5742744,0,t3_3ts1k9,From what I see its well populated. As with any MMO the population thins out a bit post level  or so as it has a grindy needsdedication element to it and thats where you lose the more casual players. On Xbox The Ebonheart Pact reds and Aldmeri Dominion yellows are the most populated factions with Daggerfall covenant blues coming in rd population wise.The Ebonheart Pact is probably the most populated faction of the  because of Skyrim. Its zones are in MorrowindSkyrim. Native races are Nord Argonian and Dark Elf.The Aldmeri Dominion occupies the south of Tamriel and is the home of the High Elves Wood Elves and the Khajiit. The Daggerfall Covenant occupy the areas around Hammerfell in the west of Tamriel and its races are Orc Breton and Redguard.When you start playing I would advise you to get the Adventurer Pack if you can as it will allow you to play any race in any alliance and its good because certain races are better in certain classes. For example the best sorcerers in game are High Elves and Bretons as they both have a racial advantage for Magicka. Look carefully at the race you choose when you choose your class. Dont worry if you get it wrong first time out  youll know if its wrong in the first  levels or so or if the class doesnt suit your playstyle. Basically Sorcerors require Magicka typically will wear light armour and mostly wield staves though you do hear about Stamina Sorcs that play with heavy armour and two handed weponsdual wield. Dragonknights need stamina and magicka and are amazingly flexible to playstyle. I have seen DKs played using a variety of races as some play them like mages and others play them like knights. A lot of people swear by using Dark Elf for them though as the dark elf has bonuses for fire magic which the DK class makes heavy use of.Nightblades are roguesassassins typically using dual wield and bows and are very much a Medium armourStamina setup. The best races for them appear to be dark Elf Khajiit or Wood Elf.Templars are a tankyheal setup typically and are best played by Nords Orcs and Argonians. They typically wear Heavy Armour but again I have seen mage style Templars using Light armour and staves. Rebuilding and running the Wailing prison which I would advise you ALWAYS do on a new char as it allows you to get some starting gear from the chests you find there takes all of  mins. Quick hints for the wailing prison  follow lyris to the open area killing the  guards on the way as part of the tutorial then kill one of the eyes up the ramp on the left at the bottom of the stairs  sneak up on the eye when its turned away from you. Then back down the ramp to the cell entrance which has been warded and lyris tells you to find Cadwell. He is actually slightly to the left of the cell entrance just behind the stone arch. After talking to him let lyris run off to the underground passage and take off and explore the open area looking for the chests and killing mobs for drops. Check the contents of Urns. You will probably gain a level and some starting gear from doing this. Dont worry about what armour or weapons you finddrop anything is better than what you have currently. Only once you have explored do you head to the end of the river and meet lyris at the entrance to the passage. force the lock on the door unless you are confident you can pick locks. The rest of it is straightforward from there. ,elderscrollsonline,cx8xyhp,4,t5_2tqi0

5766237,0,t3_3u4fr3,Stamina builds tend to be more catered to DPS and thus do burst damage. The only class that does tanking as stamina is DK. So yes AOE and sometimes single target. Generally a Magicka class tends to CC and sustain more whether it be shields or heals but does less damage with the exception of a Magicka sorc suprise suprise.

Sure if you want your customer base frustrated and getting more frustrated by continuing to throw out ideas in all directions when they have no idea where you stand on something.  There are a lot of mechanics and balance issues with this game in PvE and PvP.  They are not unknown to players or from lack of understanding of how they work.  If your entire vocal customer base said something should be one way and you made it the opposite you might want to at least ask a few more questions or explain your actions to them.  If you want to keep said customers that is.  This is not some the customer is always right thing either.You would make a horrible developer.

5777497,0,t1_cxcssmr,I would say about even. It really depends on what sets you want. If you want a BoP set specifically like the overwhelming surge set that you can only get from the IC DLC dungeons then you have to get the DLC. All the new sets in Orsinium besides crafted sets ofc are BoP also. So if youre trying to decide between one DLC or the other go with the one that drops a set that specifically benefits you and is BoP. You wont find much quality PvP in IC amymore unless youre ganking PvEers farming stones or get lucky and run into quality enemies willing to respawn and fight you. Overall I think the IC DLC is worth it just for the income potential alone. On PC each tel var stone can potentially be converted to over  gold for reference assuming you are part of at least one major trade guild. ,elderscrollsonline,cxd9497,1,t5_2tqi0

5870978,0,t3_3vn6g0,gt I honestly was gobbed smacked. Now I realize I might of missed the option that should of been labeled in red that said choose server but I downloaded via steam and can almost be certain I never saw such a option. But beyond that how could a game require  copies of assets that are largely the same. What are we talking a few config files... a language pack... certainly not two versions of each model etc... Does the EU version have slightly darker Bosmer or something and instead of saying hi like on the NA version they say how the bloody hell are ya requiring two different voice actors and sound files?With some fooling around I was able to trick the launcher into thinking the eu version was a broken US version and thus only required a small download to fix again...We play on different megaservers that are patched on different days. We might be on a different patch for days if something goes wrong it happened at least once. Having one single client would mean that when the US megaserver is updated on monday al EU players would have to wait for about  hours before they can play again once their megaserver is updated and the versions match.The patcher might not be able to go back a version or two so how would it work if you play both versions and want to change the megaserver youre playing before the other one is updated? Should it delete everything and restart downloading from  because it cant go from .. to ..? Should you be locked out of that megaserver that might be your main one?Or maybe they found that this was their best solution and you just have to deal with it and calm the hell down buddy?,elderscrollsonline,cxp7t6j,4,t5_2tqi0

It would definitely help if you mastered healing first and knew the mechanics for all the fights. Then again this is going to be great experience for you too but expect a bloody start. If you want to know if the DPS in your group was good for that particular fight they would have had to stop damaging the boss and wait for the  daedroths to spawn without killing any. If they were amazing they could kill the boss before  spawns. Again though you will feel a ton of pressure the lower the DPS and less experienced the group.,elderscrollsonline,cxv6hdl,1,t5_2tqi0

5945447,0,t3_3wsp4y,Im new to ESO as well but not to MMOs. The advice that I would like to offer is to learn group dynamics for when you start to do dungeons. Your typical set up would be TankDPSDPSHealer. Tank role is to absorb damage and force mobs enemies to attack him. Often in Heavy Armor SwordShield. Health Based.Healer role is to..well..heal. You will have healovertimes Single target Area of Effect AoE heals etc. Magicka Based.DPS Damage Per Second Damage Dealers. This can be a lot of things ArchersSorcerersMagicka HCasters etc etc. Damage things allow tank to get and keep aggro focus of the mobs while damaging. Learn strats for bosses most have pretty easy to understand mechanics. Learn by doing or just look up quick guides.. this would go for all roles.As far as general ESO advice its easy to get overwhelmed but as you play things become clear and you start to understand everything. Dont stress if you mess up attribute or especially skill points. You can redo them but youll also get a lot of skill points to spend.I could go on but just have fun with it.,elderscrollsonline,cxyz84z,5,t5_2tqi0

5948260,0,t3_3wt8j4,I have a stam sorc with bow as main weapon and it can be a challenging class to play. I say this because I reckon that using a bow as main weapon has a fairly steep learning curve but when its done right it can be a very powerful weapon in the right hands. A lot of people I see using them arent overly mobile with them and wonder why they get mowed down by packs of mobs. The biggest hint I can give is that the dodge roll is your very best friend with a bow and kiting in circles.I have equipped medium armour and tipped a decent number of points in to stam and health.I am playing it in both PvE and PvP and they do require a slightly different set of skills. Bear in mind though that I run a resto staff as backup and use power overload as ult in both bars.However I am finding Arrow Spray to be one of the most underrated skills on the bow in PvE and in PvP venom shot and later on Snipe are going to be very strong points. On top of that the sorc has a decent CC in the Shattering Prison which some nightblades will tell you is their bane. Also it has been revealed that bows will be getting a buff in upcoming changes posted I think last week. Those changes were for the PvP side of things but the weapon buffs will actually apply in both PvE and PvP. A bow works surprisingly well on a Stam sorc as there is the option of calling out your Clannfear to tank multiple mobs. I wouldnt bother with summons in PvP though. ,elderscrollsonline,cxzcihy,1,t5_2tqi0

It seems like you guys where given a much large carrot on the stick because we where also told some Kelly employees would roll over as full time Zenimax Staff however I dont know of anyone that ever became full Zenimax. Maybe one. He was laid off too though recently. They didnt give us a time frame or a window to hope for just said some of us would be kept on and left it at that. Id have to try and shake down my old trainers to see if they ever knew who was transferred from one contract to the other.Really while I loved working there at the time what rubbed me the wrong way and really freaking hurt was getting a call not from my supervisor or my coworkers or anyone who I even knew at Zenimax. I got a call from a lady telling me not to show up to work tomorrow and turn my stuff into the Kelly Services location near by.You dont get a chance to go back for anything at the office which thank fully I never brought anything. You get no close as to why you where cut over other people and thats it.The last major contact I had with most of my co workers was logging into the game its self and adding a few of them from the guild to my personal friends list as well as facebook.

6020508,1,t1_cy8t7yh,Yeah thats why games are designed that not everyone needs to be the best maxed out all pimped up.Who chooses to make an alt? Player. Who chooses to MAX that alt out? Player. Who then complains that game is frustrating burden and a slap in the face? Player.If player would skip the part of Maxing out alt then he could enjoy game more.But its the broken engame mentality that is all over ESO which makes problems everywhere. Everyone says ESO has too much levels. Its wrong eso have too few levels. And because of that and how easy is to level up people live in the broken endgame mentality. Its within their reach so they try to get there as fast as possible and in the process they burn out and start whining.If ESO had proper number of levels with proper exp curve like  levels and a exp curve without step increases like lvl gtVR people would realise that trying to grind all they way up to endgame max level is insane and they would accept that ill get there eventually and instead of rushing things they would start enjoying game. ,elderscrollsonline,cy8t9xp,-2,t5_2tqi0

6041542,0,t1_cybjkzi,Well I will explain the likely inconsequential reasons I chose a few of those things. Not argumentatively as I assume you definitely know more than I do but to I guess give you a chance to point out some things I dont understand. I am running Crystal Frags on both bars in order to spread the Blood Magic passive in Dark Magic over to  so I have some sustain on the second bar and can stay on my Destro Staff bar for longer. And on the first bar because that bar is all about defense and regenerating resources. I chose Elemental Susceptibility over Elemental Drain for the same reason I took Crystal Fragments on the second bar so I could stay on my nd DPS orient bar for longer without having to swap back and use elemental drain again. This way I can just use skills and keep it up and only swap to bar  if I am in trouble. That and can just use it once at the start of the fight and forget about it thats nice. That and the loss of magicka regen opportunity from choosing susceptibility instead of drain I imagine could be made up for with enchantsfoodset bonusmundus. However! If it is similar to bound aegis in that it goes away if I swap bars then all of this is irrelevant I chose absorb magic not because I intend to be a tank but because it seems like that since the bar is oriented around defense and regeneration h and shield seemed like the best choice because of the hS passives toward being in a generally defensive position in a fight as well as the extra armor from shields.Overload is something I feel could somehow be worked in. Maybe just take that instead of Meteor? I could absolutely do that but would Overload actually work well with a destro staff? Destro staff is what Im using on nd bar.I can easily replace Velocious Curse with Bound Aegis though. That is an easy decision now that I know it turns off. And a big part of taking velocious curse in the first place was in order to get the Daedric Protection passive on nd bar too.,elderscrollsonline,cybk193,1,t5_2tqi0

6051775,0,t1_cycui3z,Your best bet is popping open microsoft paint and going to  and using their maps to get all lorebooks and skyshards in an area AS WELL AS all locations. Print screen their map and paste it into paint and dash them off as you clear each quest hub. There are also sites which have coordinate maps of the achievement based events that occur in an area such as light bringer and extorting merchants.Its also worth noting that each of these appointed locations are a spot where ANY of those events can occur and often if you interact with one and quickly log and relog one of the other three events will be spawned in their place allowing you to knock out two events for one area in one clean go. ,elderscrollsonline,cycw0ve,-1,t5_2tqi0

6173432,0,t3_403pbt,. If you want to make set armor which gives buffs for wearing so many pieces of the set then you should research everything. Higher level sets require more traits to have been researched doesnt matter which traits. For example to make a heavy armor helmet for the Ashen Grip set you have to have finished researching any two traits on the heavy armor helmet. If you only researched one heavy armor helmet trait then you cannot create an Ashen Grip heavy armor helmet yet. The endgame sets require all nine traits to be researched in order to create that armor or weapon piece.  . Research everything because when you finish the research it gives a boost to your crafting skill.  . I recommend putting skill points into being able to research faster and two or three items at once...then later in the game when you finished all the research you want you can respec i.e. pay like k gold and reallocate your skill points.  Youll probably respec in the future anyway so you can move skill points at that time from the research enhancements into combat skills or whatever.,elderscrollsonline,cyrct01,1,t5_2tqi0

6188062,0,t3_409jhg,Back in the day just after early access first month of the game. there was this bugged quest where you had to jump to your death to be able to light this fire if you didnt get it perfect you had to try again over and over and over. People took off all their cloths so they wouldnt get destroyed by the constant deaths in some extreme cases going on for an hour of trial and error jumping. the whole thing bottlenecked players on the MQ so the room was at times filled with  naked characters repeatedly jumping off cliffs then respawning in sysiphean fashion to try it all over again.It was the closest thing to a literal hell simulator Ive ever played.Dont know why I felt compelled to share this guess its one of those in my day had to walk uphill in the snow both ways sort of thing.

6218606,0,t1_cyvlsfe,Best PVP experience would be Ultima Online. Main cities are inside a safe zone protected by guards you can get robbed or attacked but you can simply say guards and have a invulnerable bladewielding platearmored guard on the perpetrators ass. But anywhere outside the protection of the guard is PVP zone. I played it for many years and it have always worked pretty well. You usually would store your valuables in the bank before transiting between cities and if youre out adventuring unless you get ambushed really hard you could almost always avoid the bad guys either by avoiding the hot areas or simply riding like hell through everything. Youd knew the risk of adventuring and whenever you went out and came back alive and with the loot youd feel pretty awesome the tension was really something.,elderscrollsonline,cywhld6,1,t5_2tqi0

6228591,0,t3_40vdm2,I think it would work much better if we were to add it as a guild vendor expansion you can bid on specific buildings in cities each week and sell from it a predetermined item type metal arms and armour wooden weapons unrefined materials refined materials foods ingredients whatever. But you have to declare your speciality at the start of the week. The whole guild can contribute stock however prices are set by the GM or whoever they designate to set them. You get your money back immediately for putting the item in the store and the guild gets the item to sell at a sell price also set by the GM. Essentially whats happening is youre given a way to get an immediate reward without waiting for items to sell on the market in exchange for a set price while also helping contribute to your Guild by providing them items that can be sold at a profit. The officers managing the store can set Buy Price Sell Price and a starting fund from the Guild Bank that provides initial capital any items that dont sell can be returned to the guild bank at the end of the week.By setting it up in this fashion you dont step on the toes of guild vendors and people wanting to make their own auction experience but you can provide a genuine experience of a player owned cooperative store one that needs planning and thought behind it to succeed,elderscrollsonline,cyxmg7v,1,t5_2tqi0

6240803,0,t3_40zjxg,Either one has its perks really.I like playing on console because I dont like being glued to a computer desk even though it is possible to grab a gamepad with a PC. I have a laptop that could run the game which has an HDMI port I could plug into my TV. But I dont really wanna worry about all the crap that comes along with PC stuff its more of a hassle imo. Playing on console was easier for me and I see it as a benefit that I dont have to worry about keeping up with the latest addons to remain competitive. I am however jelly about the quality of the PC version versus console. Its like console players have half the game of the PC version.One thing to keep in mind is that the mega server pretty much determines when an area is too populated which I believe is consistent throughout each system. So whether youre on PC or PS youre probably going to see the same amount of players in a maximally populated area.,elderscrollsonline,cyz0fpn,2,t5_2tqi0

The point is for different motifs to have different rarities.Why shouldnt a particular motif be readily abundant to those who partake in the specific activity in which theyre rewarded? It neednt be the case that its so common but what reason is there for it to be rare and to demand it so vehemently.Is it really necessary that every motif earn you a profit?The comparison to Akaviri is also off.

Anyway after the evenings festivities of cappingdefending keeps I went back to try to level her up and thought to myself This aint the same Templar I remember being bored with.  And Ive been playing that character more than my Night Blade main ever since.  Magica build RestoDestro  light  heavy with Divines all Magica enchants Kagrenacs   Julianos    Soulshine jewelry set.  The skill loadouts differ a little bit between PvE and PvP as far as choice of ultimates but Ive found that what works for killing players in PvP works really well for killing NPCs.  Good regen the ability to kite or melee and a couple of quick shields offset the squishiness of mostly light armor.And Im also a big fan of my Stamina Night Blade.

MS did this with XB almost two years ago one of its  cores was reserved for Kinect and always locked out. They unlocked it for devs at the cost of disabling Kinect while their games were open. Nevermind Kinect was taking GPU resources which absolutely would improve performance if disabled. I believe two cores are still used for XBs OS. Not sure if there will be negative repercussions on the PS by taking the core away from the OS but Id imagine so if they had it assigned to that so far.

6532462,0,t1_czuzops,gt Cleansing Ritual Rune Focus or Rite of Passage area effects and for up to  seconds after leaving them you gain Major MendingYes and Cleansing Ritual is a  second skill with a huge m AoE while Rune Focus is a small AoE but lasts for  seconds. So its rather easy to keep up the Major Mending buff permanently.DK didnt really get any buffs for healing you already had one. You did get some nice offensive changes though but you arent going to do more healing than a Templar can. Like I said we have the same Major Mending buff than you do so our Resto skills heal the same as yours do in addition to the fact that our Templar heals heal for more than your Resto heals do plus we have other healing passives like Mending which increases our healing in proportion to how much health is lost. But in exchange for that you gain more shielding capabilities than we have and more offensive buffs so it makes up for the lack of healing in comparison I think. So you have a far better ability to prevent damage meaning you dont need as much healing while spending that time buffing people so they do more damage. I think its a good tradeoff if you like that style. Certainly should be effective.,elderscrollsonline,czv0bhu,2,t5_2tqi0

6626070,0,t3_469zh9,Blazing shield used to be a strong defense for templars.  Under softcaps it was even a stronger shield than the sorcerer hardened ward but it didnt last as long.  However it was a health  based shield so it was effectively crippled by two factors.   Putting points into health was nerfed so that it is more even with magickastam. Shield strength was nerfed by  in cyrodiil.  When you nerf a shield or heal that is based on a Percentage of your health you are actually nerfing it twice. This is the same reason people dont use dragons blood DK anymore.Reverting the health nerf andor making it so battle spirit doesnt affect health  shields and heals would go a long way to fixing templar. ,elderscrollsonline,d04oy8q,1,t5_2tqi0

Adjusted the drop rates of the Alliance Motifs. They now have a good chance to show up in treasure map chests in Cyrodiil but the chance to get them from other chests has decreased.  In addition chests in Cyrodiil now have a better chance to drop the Motifs than chests in Cyrodiil caves or the Imperial City.Crown StoreGeneral Nord Hero Armor costume The helmet will no longer distort around male Argonian eyes and will no longer clip into the heads of Khajiit and Argonian player characters. Senche Cub Pet This little cubs jaw will no longer distort when his head turns left or right.

6803780,0,t1_d0nhqra,I would say no to just getting alts to V. If you already have a V character you dont have that long until you get to V. The way its supposedly going to work is that you will receive  champ points per vet rank of your highest character. So for example if you have a V but only have like  champ points you would actually get a free  CP once vet ranks are removed. But if you have a V and youre at or over  CP then you wont receive any more.However its going to be a little while until that day comes. Its possible that its as early as the Dark Brotherhood DLC but no one can say for sure. So in the matter of a few months its probably pretty likely that youll have already hit the CP mark meaning you wont get the boost in CP when vet is removed. With that in mind you might as well continue grinding your alts to get to V because you gain a ton of CP doing so. ,elderscrollsonline,d0ni3ed,1,t5_2tqi0

6818525,0,t1_d0nsta6,You are correct when saying that they are experts of guerrilla warfare. This is how the Argonians defeated the daedra during the Oblivion Crisis. However you are utterly incorrect by avoiding the fact that they are naturally talented in the arts of stealth and agility. Any source you read will tell you that Argonians make excellent thieves due to their natural stealthiness and agility. This INCLUDES the source you provided me. Saying that a natural ability is associated with a stereotype is not appropriate.This is not to mention the Argonisns talents in the schools of magic as well.Argonians are physically tougher when it comes to resisting diseases and poison but from the SAME source you gave me Because of their physiology Argonians do have some natural protections. However their hides arent an armor exactly. Sure its a lizardlike skin but not all lizard skin is as tough as alligator skin. Think of the Argonian skin as more of a snakes skin. It offers some protection but its certainly not as thick or durable as actual armor.Now if you know anything about snakes youd know that their flesh isnt hard to penetrate.Now let me help you out with the information regarding the Hist Tree. Yes there is an armor set called Hist Bark but that has nothing to do with Argonian durability specifically. Argonians are considered to be direct descendants of the Hist Tree but Argonians themselves are not trees. That is like saying an apple is as tough as the bark from an apple tree.Now to wrap it all up when talking about an Argonians tanky nature it doesnt extend much further than their ability to heal and resist disease and poison. If you capture an Argonian a Nord and an Orc and torture all three of them the Argonian will be the first to die.,elderscrollsonline,d0p6fe9,1,t5_2tqi0

Templars are the only ones to have a dedicated class skill tree to healing and have some great support abilities  and can definitely add to DPS. Nightblades also have some class skills that heal while DPSing at the same time. Any class can use a restoration staff as well for healing. Oh and in the latest patch I believe Magicka DKs were given a bit of a buff to how they can heal with class abilities. Although all classes can do it I personally think Templar is easiest because of the built in heals Breath of Life as well the support abilities repentance and shards to give stamina back to team purifying ritual for cleansing debuffs etc. Definitely doesnt mean they are the only ones who can do it though. ,elderscrollsonline,d180qxy,1,t5_2tqi0

6993499,0,t1_d191rkz,Its because ZOS current expansion model is poisonous for the game. st reason why its bad  new zones are being released too oftennd reason why its bad  there is virtually no new contend being added to old zones.ExplanationWith new DLCs being released every  months and new grinds TG grind new gear grind new trial grind new dungeon grind players are jumping from one hype train to another hype train. There is no cooldown period between DLCs. One hype starts player swarm new dlc and grind stuff and just before they grind out what they want new dlc comes up.Currently we have only  new DLC zones but already IC was getting empty might change now that we have  less campaign  you can see more and more people struggling to finish Orsinium WB. And shall we mention Craglorn? I dont think i have to explain how virtually impossible is to find a group to clear all the Crag delves or storyline.With each new DLC playerbase is siphoned to the next newest zone and live is being sucked out of older zones.If this will continue    DLCs in the future. The game will be in very bad condition if there will be absolutely no attempt on ZOS side to revitalise old zones especially free zones like Craglorn that has enormous potential and interesting storyline that sadly very few will experience.What we seen in TG was a very little attempt to make things good. I liked how storyline quest told me to visit other zones. I also enjoy how sending people out for TG missions to other zones is bringing people there even if they go there just for pickpocketing or safeboxes they might end up helping some new cadwell player to finish dolmen or a world boss.But at the same time we see a most severe negligence on ZOS side like STUBBORNLY REFUSING to let old trials scale all the way to VR including all the loot from there.

7071718,0,t3_4cfzu9,I think they should focus on fixing what they have first before implementing new game modes. PvP is extremely fun and a huge part of the game so I dont understand why criticalbasic features are still broken. For instance the group matchmaking. Players are constantly running around trying to find players to group with or wondering aimlessly around a huge empty map. How can something so simple still not work? This would vastly improve pvp when population is low and people would not immediately abandon less populated servers. Social relationships are the fucking foundation of any lasting MMO so the grouping tools need to work. Please fix Group Finder for PvP.Besides that they should add a pvp training ground in the home base of each faction. Basically a stadium where friendly fire is turned on and let players of the same faction fight each other. Obviously they would have to group up before entering where upon entering each group would get their own instance. I think this adds to the logic of the world because it is a training ground before they go out and fight in the real war.I believe this will add to the current pvp experience without the negatives of dividing the population. Honestly I imagine a more Fight Club kinda vibe from it. ,elderscrollsonline,d1hxxr3,6,t5_2tqi0

7078427,0,t1_d1inqh1,Welcome to The Elder Scrolls Online Breath of Kyne  our first Expansion Pack taking you deep into the heart of Western Skyrim and beyond to unlock the secrets of the divines and their role in the longpast Merethic Era and their reaction to the first Dragonbreak.New Features A Grand Adventure in Western Skyrim as the war in Cyrodiil spills north the alliances seek to gain control of The Staff of Marukh said to be lost to the first Dragonbreak. A new class! The naturebound Warden shall lead her allies into the untamed realms of Tamriel combining martial prowess Hunters Cunning skill line with the blessings of nature Primal Spirit skill line and a mastery over the harshest of elements Winterborn skill line to turn the tides of battle in her favor. Three new weapons! Spears Crossbows and HandtoHand weaponry have broken the dragon and clearly have been here the whole time. Spears can be one or two handed weapons Crossbows join Bows in the newly renamed Marksmanship skill line and HandtoHand are one handed. Certain HandtoHand styles will have different animations depending on how they are used with other weapons  meaning you can finally wield just one weapon. New Skill line  Beast Mastery! Befriend and Command the beasts of Tamriel utilizing the summoning mechanics we implemented for Sorcerers in The Thieves Guild patch. A new passive in the skill line will allow your Soul Trap spell to add defeated creatures to your Collections menu where you can choose which of your new companions you will summon. The five active skills will then let you summon the creature you have designated of that classification Tank Melee Physical Ranged Physical ST Magic with healer morph AoE Magic with healer morph to join you in battle and provide a classificationbased active ability.FOUR new playable races Daggerfall Covenant  The proud Tsaesci Outcasts living in a secret enclave along the Cyrodiil  Dragontail Mountains edge have not taken lightly to the incursion of the alliances and have chosen to defend their new home by allying with the Daggerfall Covenant whom they believe will lead them to a return to the glory of the Akaviri Potentate. Aldmeri Dominion  Goblins have long served as little more than slaves to their Altmeri cousins  but far spread among the wild and deep places of Tamriel a certain Queen has seen fit to make use of the rise of KingShaman Bowee to her advantage and offer the emancipation of their brethren up as payment for services rendered as the  Dominions newest scouts and advisers in primal magicks. Ebonheart Pact  A small island shrouded in mist off the eastern coast of Black Marsh has revealed my greatest hope! A Kothringi outpost untouched by Knahaten Flu thanks to the mournful duties of Quarantine. Their leader a powerful shaman in her own right saw in a vision the truth of the flu and of her peoples exodus to the island and then their long march to a winter war. Upon learning of the alliance politics she has sworn her peoples fealty to the Pact believing them to be the best hope of her people being allowed to live in peace and solitude when her vision has been fulfilled. Any  Time broke for them because Time was not Man. Returning from Fallinesti and the edges of Time itself the Imga have come to the Alliances with a warning and a need. Marukh is back  and he needs his staff.,elderscrollsonline,d1ipdk1,41,t5_2tqi0

7091780,0,t3_4cnn2e,At your level Id actually say to run Ritual of Rebirth Healing Ritual morph. Its a huge heal thats really mana efficient. Late game its hardly used because it has a small channel time and later on when mobnpc DPS is higher people need a heal NOW not . seconds from now but I think its a perfect combo of efficiency and potency for you leveling with a friend. Also puncturing sweeps allows you to get some pretty respectable DPS when questing while also healing yourself.

Although using some mundus stonesmostly the ones that are  it is sometimes better to have divines on all peices.

If you cant get footmans try some endurance rings and anything that gives spell resistance armor or health.. Weapons  hand and shield of course. Allows you to use puncture and blocking with all those passives gives somewhere around  damage reduction with high armorspell resist On a second bar if you really want you could probably use dual wield or two hander but I just stick with  hand and shield on both bars.. Skills Green Dragon Blood is a great self heal. Tbh I dont really use it much because if the healer is any good you probably wont need to but if you get in a tight situation its there. Some kind of crowd control is also great. Talons or Ash Cloud are great for this. Pierce armor or a morph are must haves. I prefer Puncture because it softens the boss and you dont really need the extra armor from ransack. Finally if youre using armor master evasion is probably best though unstoppable could work too If youre not spiked armor or a morph is good. You pop those skills and youll be a lot tankier. On the other bar... I use exactly the same thing except for inner fire instead of puncture. Swap bars and use that taunt if you need a ranged one or you run out of stamina.. Anything tanky reducing damage etc. Health regen stamina regen Tenacity reduces stamina ability costs reduced CC length... its not too hard just look around the tree for anything that will make you tankier.. Youre not a pure stamina user. Spiked armor Ash storm talons green dragon blood... those are al magicka skills. You still need the stamina and the health of course so youll probably be using purple food. Same for pots. Just use tripots.. Spiked armor taunt. Block. Auto attack between boss attacks. Block. Attack. Block. Taunt. Repeat. Heal if you get low. Tanks dont really do much. Different bosses may require different things. Of note is the Planar Inhibitor from WGT. Youll want to have a DPS set on the side so you can kill portals. And the boss too but portals is the main one.,elderscrollsonline,d204p8q,1,t5_2tqi0

I play a full melee stam build and use heavy attacks quite a bit in conjunction with Wrecking Blow and for stam return both in PvE and PvP.

Storytelling blows WoW and ESO out of the water visually...blows them out of the water...class balance and overall enjoyment of play...also blows them out of the water. But to be fair..ESO And FFXI are two VERY different MMOS. Comparing them is not really fair. I enjoy ESO dont get me wrong.

7409917,0,t1_d2kg4m1,Im not an expert on how blackwater is scaled but Ill repeat what Ive heardYoull have better stats based on having good gear for your current level. Everything is battle leveled but the better your gear matches up to your level the more it will contribute.  light is good but the people youre fighting likely have set bonuses and at least blue if not purple armor and weapons. Weapons especially are important because each upgrade goes directly into weaponspell damage.Ive just gotten into pvp and I see people fill their health all the way up in  seconds and meanwhile Im struggling to resist the onslaught of multiple enemies but as a V in a champion point campaign where Im halfway to cap my gold gear isnt enough to take me to the top. You want to go in with a plan at least for you. Figure out one or two good opening skills. Be able to fight from range and up close. Gap closers are good though some of them are glitched and require smooth terrain to work properly. Make sure you can heal yourself. You want some kind of AoE or other ability that will bring your enemy out of stealth flare from the war skill lines magelight from mage guild. Having an execute can do amazing things for finishing a fight.Im a templar. I am not optimized. I run with two restoration staves. My back bar is utility siege shield dark flare healing ward purifying ritual and retreating maneuver. Dark flare is to fight to and from keep walls. Healing ward is my heal for when Im already low health. Maneuver is mostly for riding. Front bar is the same thing I use in PVP Puncturing sweeps radiant oppression honor the dead need to switch back to breath of life as I do more group content blazing spear and toppling charge. I start with the AoE blazing spear I toppling charge to close the gap I spam sweeps until theyre at around  health and then I execute with radiant oppression. Breath of life as needed. If the fight goes long I switch bars and throw in healing wardpurifying ritual to keep myself in good shape. Theres a new DLC around the corner so Im not sure what direction Ill be going but Im  AP away from Magicka Detonation and Ill probably swap radiant magelight onto my back bar to keep an eye out for the sneaky ones.I PVPd for a couple of days when I was lower level. Some guildies showed me the basics and I did not do particularly well. The best teacher Ive had in this game is Maelstrom Arena because it taught me I can die with a smile on my face resurrect hop on my horse and charge back in.

Not only that but as time went on I got better and better. The progress in my play...not my characters stats or the gear or even the skills they used was as satisfying as improving MY play. There is still improvement to be had in my play and I hope there to always be. Also everyones performance AC or not is dependent on system performance.  of the time the better player wins AC or not. Its just that most of the better players or those wanting to be better are improving their AC rotations and usages. This is my first MMO and I can compare it to really nothing else Ive ever played.

7506791,0,t1_d2vgvds,Okay...some quick notes. You dont always necessarily want to choose the stamina morphs of your skills  example youll want Lightning Form but it may turn out better for you to have the one that costs magicka to use up that pool because the buffs are the same regardless of morphs.I can suggest a shieldoriented tank because otherwise Sorc tanks dont have much utility and theyre just meat shields. HampSHampS is always solid but you could do H on your backbar for potentially the Rally heal and more interestingly the Brawler aoe  big shield for trash pulls.You want both your taunts. Pierce Armor from HampS and Inner Fire play around with which morph you want of this. Yes one is stamina but it may end up draining too much of your stam pool.Grab Bone Shield from the Undaunted line and train that up you can use that as an allpurpose stamina shield in DB.Definitely want Bound Armaments on both bars for the max stam bonus.PvP a bit for Vigor itll be your main selfheal. PvP some more for Warhorn and morph it to Aggressive Warhorn  this is essential for your group in more serious tanking.Encase for group utility root trash mobs with it.,elderscrollsonline,d2vhfav,2,t5_2tqi0

I simply dont think the devs should go out of their way to cater to that style of gameplay just because vX Twitch streamers are popular.  Just my opinion.,elderscrollsonline,d34feye,1,t5_2tqi0

If you go to the GMDB.TV website you will see there is no personal voice acting in a lot of the game movies unless they were already in the game.This Game Movie isnt for everyone but this is the way myself and my partners wanted it and there are plenty of others who appreciate it.The reason its like that in every game that has character customization we use established characters from the website to tie them into the Eterna project. The whole point of this Game Movie is to give you a cinematic experience of the game and its quests. I can understand wanting voice acting added with the dialogue option we choose but we leave ample time to read through the text options we choose simply because having different voices for a character in the Eterna project wouldnt correlate. ,elderscrollsonline,d37iku9,-1,t5_2tqi0

7640547,0,t1_d3alczx,Relatedly make health matter as much as magicka or stamina. Health is supposed to be the tank stat but its utility is much less than the other two stacking health gets you nothing and actually takes away from your damage and capacity to manage resources for abilities. In terms of content and fight mechanics which is also part of the problem with tanking you really only need k health to tank any content in the game any more than that is a liability.Solutions Make something scale with Health. My favorite idea so far is for Health to give you a reduction in all abilities and action costs including block break free dodgeroll etc. I dont know what the numbers should be but it should be comparable to the increase in damage that maxing out magstam can bring as well as help make up somewhat for having smaller resource pools. Similar to how MagickaStamina increase your damage there needs to be a reason to invest in the Health stat beyond being a meat shield with no sustain.  Simply remove damage scaling from MagickaStamina.,elderscrollsonline,d3aorrf,15,t5_2tqi0

7660701,0,t1_d3csgbn,vMSA not being fun or challenging anymore is mainly the huge balance issue. Any Magicka class who know the mechanics will not find challenge in vMSA after several completions. vMSA is hugely favored for ranged attacks. Sustaining your Magicka is also alot easier compared to an Stamina class who have to spend alot of ressources on VigorDodgeroll. If you look at the leaderboards you will see the top  points for Magicka classes is ALOT higher than top  of Stamina classes. If both were equal they would be able to buff it more or make it harder in some  way but if they did that now the Stamina classes would fall even further behind.,elderscrollsonline,d3cz82i,3,t5_2tqi0

You get to know how much everything sells for with zero effort. This means you can flip items very easily. You can undercut prices at the right level. The potential is there to make massive amounts of money. Now add in all the console players who have no access to this addon. PC players would absolutely dominate the market because they have easy access to the price points of every item while console players are blind. This goes back into the leveling since PC players are likely to be comparitively very rich next to their console counterparts not even mentioning the extra year of old money in the PC platform theyre going to have easier access to buying the best gear xp potions etc and that would have an impact in the PvP as well.,elderscrollsonline,d3jz7xm,2,t5_2tqi0

7748669,0,t1_d3mx6r3,I did exactly what OP said and youve described my experience vrekt group playrad. Im about two months in and it has be a blast. Three things to help OP get started You are likely to suck at close range. Your damage is poor youre squishy and you dont know what youre doing. Keep an eye on positioning and always keep people especially DKs between you and the enemy. When your instinct is to charge and finish a kill resist that urge. Radiant destruction is a very long range skill.  Dont lock into gear too quickly. You get tons of gear from your alliance via the mail. Try out relevant sets. Transmutation and Vicious Death are both great. I ended up rolling with two loadouts one thats more resilient and buffs healing and the other for straight glasscanon damage dealing. I still havent upgraded to gold.  Radiant destruction. Use it. Be on the lookout for anyone in execute range and finish them. This is a boon to your group since you can execute at range. You prevent enemies escaping stealthing or healing back up by frying them where they stand. Bonus dont stand too near other people. The vicious death set can be used with soul tether and proximity detonation to murder whole groups more or less instantly. When you see people bunching up keep your distance  meters and if youre standing still like capturing a resource stand there with block active. Edit speeling,elderscrollsonline,d3myt2g,5,t5_2tqi0

Otherwise Id just try to get a group or even just a bunch of people if youre not in an actual group and stick with them as much as you can being alone in Cyrodiil is pretty much asking for a bad time.Youre right about guilds though got to be invited by someone in the guild to join cant search for one.

Finish the main quest go through Coldharbour save the world and you can move on to Cadwells Silver which will be the areas of a different alliance. After that you can do Gold which will be the third and final alliance.    . Level your crafting skills have fun and take it slow! Enjoy the story dont rush to max level.  Focus on either stamina or magicka for damage youll level faster than going hybrid or tank build.  Of course if youre planning to be a tank and doing dungeons before max level you can spec into it and it wont slow you down too much..

7788686,0,t1_d3rhi9d,Do you do any competitive PvE or PvP? Vet maelstrom? Vet maw? These are essential passives and abiltiies that will significantly alter DPS of all classes due to the loss of a spell damageweapon damage buff from potions.

As for the passives burning light power stone etc are ESSENTIAL for being effective with a Templar or sorcerer. Without these passives there is no reason to play these classes over a Dragonknight or Nightblade due to the loss of a way to use ulti more often.

7851823,0,t1_d3ylpbn,It says your attacks cause targets to take  more damage from poisons for  seconds So I assume that is snipe damage BUT it wont work on an opening snipe since you have to attack them first to trigger the debuff and its pretty hard to land snipes against good players soI know alcasts made a NB build that worked mainly with bow and he worked with  marksmen and  hawk eye. He hit like a truck but was a glass cannon. I think with me being a DK I wont have as much burst as a NB but Ill have a little more defense and sustain which I dont mind. Im trying to stay away from H cuss I already have a few characters that use that so Im kinda over it but its just the best close weapon for what Im going for.. I have igneous weapons which already gives me the major brutality buff. Green dragon blood which is a nice heal and gives me good stam recovery. I always use vigor so theres  decent heals and if I go DW the new flurry morph that are adding is a decent heal too. Only thing with DW is theres no gap closer. I could go sword and shield and sacrifice some damage for defend and just apply my DoTs and hope they finish off someone.. But if Im going for a more glass cannon then whats the point in getting a little more defense and giving up a ton of damage with H. ,elderscrollsonline,d3ym5ev,1,t5_2tqi0

7916137,0,t3_4np4x6,gt I have  Ti on SLI  ... Complete overkill I am not sure that ESO can effectively SLI in any case.  I get  fps on a k monitor using a single X slightly faster than a .gt ... I still get the exact same framerates as playing on ultra. ...This is the key symptom.  The graphics cards are not the bottleneck here theyre probably only getting  utilisation.  You may as well set it to ultra with a few exceptions as I will explain below.The bottleneck you are experiencing is singlecore CPU performance.   Chips with lots of cores but individually slower cores such as the V chips or the AMDs do not currently perform well with ESO because ESO can only actually use one or two of those cores.  Overclocking will help significantly but ingame the key to you getting better FPS is to reduce the graphics settings which add load to the CPU rather than the GPU.  These are draw distance and the number of particle effects.You can automate this by installing Votans Adaptive Settings which will dynamically adjust the settings as you move around the world and configuring a target FPS I would suggest around .In the future the singlecore CPU bottleneck may be improved when they move from DX to DX.  DX only allows a single process to interact with the driver whereas DX natively supports multithreading.   But dont expect this quickly  migrating from DX to DX would be a massive project since the APIs are very different.  Right now nVidias DX support is well mediocre but should have improved by the time ESO has a DX client.  AMDs DX current drivers are very good they had a big headstart with Vulcan  DX has basically copied the Vulkan approach.,elderscrollsonline,d45ukcp,1,t5_2tqi0

It may not be the best justification but its all I got. I am intensely loyal to DC it has my two favourite races but the goal from my characters point of view is the restoration of all of Tamriel which is also why allowing the Maormer on Tempest Island to flourish is absolutely unacceptable because while it would benefit the DC it would weaken Tamriel as a whole.

7936913,0,t3_4nyt0s,youre still a little ways of reaching  and from there there is still some progression left. no need to restart but i would think about tuning your stats when you want to do some more serious content.ampnbspyour skill trees look great you are leveling all the trees fairly evenly which is a good sign. You should however level both medium and light armor as well they can both be very useful.pick another weapon line you can switch weapons with  key using only one weapon type is like using only one hand.Make SURE to choose either stamina or magica not both unless you are tanking then both are very useful and then pick the abilities and morphs which usescale from the chosen stat. This is important because abilities have their damage based among other things from your stat pools thus the more magica the more your spells which cost magic will do.And dont restart you can respec both attributes and abilites at your major city. and you still have plenty of time to level other things and change the way you build.though stay to a build that  you like. ampnbspGear. make sure to get gear that benefits your stats and build style. i.e. if you are stamina based dual wielder then use gear which boosts weapon damagegtmax staminagtweapon critgtstamina regeneration.take a loot at the different sets which can be crafted or found. the higher the quality and match your level the better you will be in the pvp zones.ampnbspPVP be prepaired to die... a lot!! its a big learning curve and you will probably feel that you spend more time dead than actually fighting. you will get better it just wont be easy at the start. i recomend joining a group  type LFG in pvp zone chat  so you can learn the ropes from there.if you have access to a low level pvp guild that would be best these guys can really help when learning the mechanics of pvp.Just be patient and learn from your deaths. i.e. should you have blocked or dodged was it a good time to break out of that cc do i have enough tools to help me survive on my ability bars?ampnbsplastly which abilities you use are extreemly different to what you use in pve content. you need utility on your bars. i.e. stuns! snares! heals! shields! abilities to help you with resources! stealth detection! gap closers and of course damage! you actually tick most of these boxes already. Id say you just need to play around with which abilities will work best for you. and change your attribute pick magica or stamina not both and while health is important you dont need  points in it. ,elderscrollsonline,d486mzl,4,t5_2tqi0

7984983,0,t1_d4dbb01,Im not saying that the Shadow passives dont help with tanking in general im saying they dont provide a benefit over those of other classes to a stamina tank. If youre talking about the skill Summon Shade this provides a  seconds of Minor Main  less damage and also Major Ward and Resolve. Its two in one yes but Heroic Slash and Immovable provide these effects respectively for longer. I have NBs myself so Im aware of how easy it is spam SwallowFunnel. However when theyre putting out measly damage on a stamina tank as thats what Im referring to the healing component is negligible. Im also aware of how good Veil is however that skill alone doesnt make a stamina tank again as thats what were talking about worth going. I think Ive encountered you on here before getting  what Im going to call  defensive about a comment I made regarding a NB tank. In that case I said they were the worst tanking class and in this case Im saying stamina NB tanks arent worthwhile. Im using the term defensive because both on occasions yoube ranted for a lack of a better word at this time on that NBs are viable tanks in response to a specific issue Ive raised with them in which Ive never argued that NBs arent viable tanks. In answer to your final sentence OP asked if its possible to make a viable NB tank and mentioned that all heshes mentioned is Magicka which lead to me believe that heshe was asking about a stamina tank. I advised that it is viable depending on content but highlighted the issues that would arise and some ways to overcome those.

Its not a particularly unique or noteworthy MMO nor is it a good fit for a lot of the dedicated TES fans who play the series for the fact that its a singleplayer RPG. But its got a lot of interesting lore contributions and its there for people who really want to see a lot more of Tamriel so those are gonna tend to be the bulk of people who keep coming back. But again thats a niche. Also a lot of people still havent played it because of the price tag since a  price tag is a lot for an MMO especially one that leans really heavily on microtransactions.

Its certainly fun to play two or three characters at a time and send resources to all of them especially if you designate one as your official crafter. Its really all personal choice. More characters equals more time spent leveling them all but on the other hand it can also provide more resources and inventory space.,elderscrollsonline,d52uh6k,2,t5_2tqi0

I would have to say I agree with almost every aspect pointed out here and strongly agree with your points on endgame contentprogressionrewarding.The endgame grind is just so stale in ESO whereas a lot of MMOs I play in the past have the most stimulating endgame of all. Would really love to see ZOS step up their approach to endgame content and give us more rewarding play with less friction and monotonous grinding.

8222358,0,t1_d5588oy,Armor master is overkill if you are just doing dungeon content. You can hit armor cap by just running heavy armor with any set. Mobs dont have armor penetration.

Reason Bleed dots boss penetration and bonus critAll Precise Daggers for Trials other than Maelstorm ArenaReason Healers and Tanks will be running enough debuffsthat you wont need much penetration.For PVP always maces and always sharpened on your offhandwith either sharpened or nirnhoned on your main hand.Reason Maces deal irresistible damage. The sharpened bonus applies the same in either handwhile the Nirnhoned bonus is  times stronger in your main hand. Overall sharpened is best but it is useless againstshields junk mobs and players without much mitigation while the nirnhoned trait helps you to a lesser degree but also helps you  of the time.

I would make your Argonian a Magicka Nightblade instead of a Magicka Templar. Nightblades make great healers but they dont have a burst heal so the extra power from the Argonian passives will really help. You could also play an Argonian Sorcerer but Sorcerer healers arent super popular although I find them fun and quite effective. That will cut down on the doubling up flor Magicka Templar and free you to play the Imperial with a more fitting class.,elderscrollsonline,d5ox9ik,2,t5_2tqi0

So you are getting  XP and  XP at the same time via a multiplier just applied to different things which is probably why I was thinking two numbers. This is why both the official website and uesp.net state that enlightenment XP is at  times the normal rate. It is but thats only part of the picture.

I can tank vICP in light armor but when it comes to vet trials this wont properly work anymore.The new AA and Helra especially require a lot of Stamina management as you have to tank a lot of mobs at times. Running out of stam can and will wipe your whole team in certain fights. Pieces sturdy is all you need as infused on big pieces gives a nice boost to resources tristat glyphs. While you already have a lot of reduction from that shieldplay enchants on jewelry paired with a decent amount of points in shadowward? points is definitly recommended.For beginners i recommend tavas favor  some random set going further you want to try to get ebon alkosh and for certain situations yokeda lunar bastion or other aoe support sets.

8581353,0,t3_4xaq80,Also... think of your internet connection. Sometimes the problem is not your rig but your internet.If you port to your a main city game takes a little to load everything around you? I test it on Mournhold since the area near the port shrine is always crawling with players. Thats your connection sending you data from all players running around slowly equiping them with their items and their movements once you get all data things go smoothly.Now think of a large scale battles where not only game must load all those players but also control skills spells attacks damage... in real time. If your internet connection is not fast enough to receive enough data at a decent rate to control whats happening youll stutter. Not because of graphics issues but because of a network bottleneck.And this is not only an ESO game this has happened on most online games when lots of data must be transfered ASAP. If you cant transferreceive enough data sun enough it starts queuing since battle keeps happening. And if your FPS usually normalizes once the dust settles thats another hint.Still as some people said you can help your game prevent that much data. If you lower your view distance less things are loaded on screen and thus less things the server must inform you about.Think of enabling a latency addon Wykkyds toolbar has one and see if your latency goes insane the same time your FPS drops on Cyrodiil if it does then your issue is a network bottleneck not a graphical problem. ,elderscrollsonline,d6e96ay,1,t5_2tqi0

8651549,0,t1_d6n184a,The answer is no for psijic ambrosia yes to training you can research training at crafting stations but that would take a while to research all of them to craft yourself you can likely find someone to craft it for you for very cheap or even free if you provide materials if you were on PC id just make you both a full set for free its pretty cheap stuff when you hit max level.The psijic ambrosia is very expensive it requires a recipe that you wont be able to afford or craft assuming you dont have maxed provisioning and it requires perfect roe to craft which comes from skinning fish.  I believe the rate is somewhere around  in every  fish.  Because of that it costs close to k for a perfect roe however a max provisioner will have a passive that creates  extra drinks when crafting so one perfect roe can create  psijic ambrosia if you go to a guild store in your alliances main city you can find them for about  gold... these are PC prices however ymmv.That being said you wont need either training gear or psijic ambrosia tbh it would take you longer to get them than itll take to simply grind the levels.  Theres easily googleable guides for grinding locations by level for each alliance.  The link below is what I use for Ebonheart Pact.

8680223,0,t3_4yuxpl,Yeah thats the issue with reviewing mmos or any online game that is built with the intention of adding and patching content over a longer period of time. For example of you review cod or battlefield youre basically reviewing a campaign and some multiplayer features. The only thing that will need added is maps and you wont really see major changes to systems or quality of life features. Those games are expected to decline in about a year when the next game comes out. MMOs on the other hand are expected to be played over multiple years and will see a number of updates. Reviews should definitely reflect that or at least the state of the game at the time of the review. ,elderscrollsonline,d6qnh86,3,t5_2tqi0

8696445,0,t1_d6rssdv,For the record I upvoted you because you were indeed answering the question. I can only assume that its people disagreeing with you but not following up with a comment which is less than helpful.As uKazan said you dont have access to Luas standard library nor any API aside from the one that ESO provides. The workaround I suggested should be possible but it would require users to run extra software which is something Im sure a lot of people would have a problem doing. I have some spare time this afternoon so Ill see if I can come up with a proof of concept.Your original post is something I was thinking about literally  hours before I read it. Im sure many people would disagree with me here but I played Eve Online for many years and the ability to place buy orders is something that I feel ESO sorely lacks.ESOs market allows for much higher margins in comparison to Eve Online which is not inherently a bad or a good thing but not having buy orders makes everything so much effort that without sufficient margins that take into account the sheer amount of time it takes to make certain things a lot of things just seem pointless. Having buy orders would take at least some of the pain away from gathering raw materials and thus lower some of the cost time of making items.,elderscrollsonline,d6soq3w,2,t5_2tqi0

8731876,0,t3_4zm8bs,Definitely a questionable set while . isnt quite as useless as people think its still extremely low considering its a  piece. The best use I can think of for this is a stamblade dueling build. Run  piece skirmisher  piece crusader with all wellfitted and then either  malubeth for constant heals and DoT or skoriavelidreth for more burst damage. Then run mirage poison injection caltrops rending slashes siphoning attacks incapacitating strike and maybe arrow barrage then dodge roll every time its off cooldown dropping those DoTs and then hitting them with burst damage with light attacks in between dodges dropping that incapacitating strike for the stun and  damage buff. Basically extremely difficult to hit while still putting out solid constant DoT damage.Would still be questionable Id have to actually test it to see if its even viable but seems like it could be a lot of fun. Regardless the . second value is still simply too short to make this set particularly powerful in any build it needs to be at LEAST  second to really make this useful I think because then it would at least cut off  of the the roll dodge penalty cooldown,elderscrollsonline,d6x4pjw,2,t5_2tqi0

As a sorcerer you can easily be a good dps for either one.  And most importantly is to have fun.  If you are interested Pm me your name and I can invite you to a good friendly guild.

Things like health are taken care of by enchantments and that sort of thing just make sure you have enough health through other sources to not instantly explode.With food and everything a dps hopefully has around k some people will aim for lower but if you can get to k fully buffed youll have enough health for literally any content in the game.  If you arnt that concerned about VetTrial stuff then it doesnt even matter that much just stack that damage dont stand in red profit.  Tanks actually arnt that different they will be stacking magicka or stamina heavily they are only looking to hit around k health meaning they arnt really needing that much more health and thats for main tanks.  They literally might be putting  points in health max and thats for full tanks.   Why do I mention this?  To help reinforce the idea that as a dpshealer you will just  stat dump into stamina or magicka and never look back.  ,elderscrollsonline,d7153wz,4,t5_2tqi0

You need to be heavy attacking as a Stam sorc. It does a ton of damage if you have bound armaments on your bar and it also restored stamina. I dont want to change your build all together because i strongly believe you should theory craft and make personal builds but.... Use h as your damage bar and either bow or sb back bar. Stam sorc has a couple things really going for it in pvp. Burst and mobility. Without a h front bar your missing out on so much potential damage. With a bow back bar youve got access to a huge speed buff after every dodge roll a ranged spamable ability that acts as an execute alsopoison inject. combo goes like this wind up a heavy bow attack release it by pressing poison injection switch bars immediately crit Rush in dawnbreak execute. Thats almost always enough to kill someone and you should still have more than  Stam after words. Always keep hurricane up and remember that if youre using heavy armor make use of the passives and always work in heavy attacks.

8829804,0,t3_514jde,Youre numbers are pretty good. k hp is probably the lowest you want to have while going into group dungeons as there are some big k hits. Lots of people strive for k hp but you should be fine with k as a ranged magicka  nightblade. Also always keep the buff up from strife swallow soul is the morph I took. That will give you constant heals that will help as well. If those numbers are without food Id say you can take some points away from health and put towards magicka and use a bi stat max health and max magicka. Those potions give you around k hp So get your hp down to about k and pop that potion to boost your hp to around k You might have to wait for CP for the good bi stat potions. As far as armor just make sure you have  or more light pieces to get the light armor passives. You shouldnt need to much heavy or medium as a nightblade uses abilities for survivability and not so much armor. ,elderscrollsonline,d797wbf,1,t5_2tqi0

As a rule of thumb I decon everything that I dont need for research purposes regardless of color  even whites.    For Enchanting once I got up around Level  I found another guy here on reddit who needed to power level and we just crafted about  Purple Glyphs and traded them to one another and it got us both the last  levels we needed.    For Provisioning and Alchemy you can powerlevel each of them in  minutes as long as you have some spare ingredientsregents and a few recipes evenly spaced out along the skill level spectrum to continue gaining Inspiration from crafting.    Ive been a Level  crafter for quite some time now and the above tips are how I went about it.    Im on XBNA.  If youre there too feel free to hit me up on live or in game and I can help you out with advice as well as some powerleveling.  My GT TSpielman,elderscrollsonline,d79b1ac,4,t5_2tqi0

I know.  People were guesting in anyway.  But they could have kept the old rules turned off queuing as a group for Cyrodiil and disable cross alliance guild chat if you were inside Cyrodiil.

Gear set to pull in range spammers and root them for an AOE vicious death explosion? Got it. Want to turn into a skeleton randomly? Sure. There may be some imbalance right now but nothing Ive seen on Xbox is too awful. Even with a  man AD zerg of sun shield spamming reactive templar tanks and permarooting magicka DKs it really only takes  of us with a few well placed skills to wipe them.

8858025,0,t3_51kc2d,VR levels are gone! replaced with the champion point CP system and its not just a renamed VR level system. Not sure if you played with the champion system in place but a quick run down. once you hit  any xp earned goes towards champion points. these points can be spent in the champion trees which increase stats like stat regeneration reduce cost reduce x damage type etc.  CP are shared for each character on your account. so once you have one level  with x champion points every character will have x points. I.E. only need to grind once D there is a cap it is slowly increased with patches and there is a catch up mechanic which allows people with fewer CP to earn them quicker. gear works in tiers of champion points highest being cp gear. so end game gear is not too far away once reaching ampnbspso leveling is much easier now not only because of the VR removal but some other decent QOL quality of life changes such as training trait changes which now grant x x depending on quality of item from killing things experience potions which can be bought from players or learn to craft yourself experience scrolls found on the cash shop rings of mara and finaly eso . All these things can more than double your experience gain with all that you can get someone to power level you and you can have level  in a couple of hours.from there you can earn CP with xp boosts also affecting this and once you hit  cps you can invest in late game gear. any additional CP does affect your total effectiveness. to prevent high cp players dominating low cp players in pvp there are noncp campaigns.ampnbsp,elderscrollsonline,d7cly6e,2,t5_2tqi0

Admittedly when I switch to  Aether i will lose a good chunk of spell power which might make those points in blessed a lot more critical and that might prompt me to start respeccing but its certainly not a definitive blanket statement that you cant switch from heal to DPS without a respecHe cant switch mid trial properly due to running twice born but you can absolutely heal effectively without respeccing CP.

8996013,0,t3_53htjv,gtAny way to change ESO Steam to the other version? Maybe in the future?Contractually ESO are unable to sell people subscriptions if they have a steam account  this includes when people buy gifts for them.  Youd have to buy it from the steam shop I would imagine if you want to gift it to him.Similarly theyre not allowed to convert a steam account to a nonsteam account.This is because Steam take a big  from the steam shop sales and they dont want people to be able to bypass it.I am pretty sure that you can buy people steam giftcards which they can credit to their steam accounts.

9147600,0,t3_55krev,If you are activating the Overkill buff from the Molag Kena Monster Helm then you might want to consider slotting Spell Symmetry within the Mages Guild skillline. It allows you to exchange  Health or lower if you have points invested within the Mages Guild passives for X Magicka and it also reduces the cost of your next ability by  if casted within  seconds.If you are having Magicka sustain issues I would recommend switching from Hardened Ward to Empowered Ward for the  increase to Magicka Recovery. Slotting Harness Magicka will also restore Magicka when taking any Magic Damage. Mystic Orb from the Undaunted skillline can provide a powerful synergy that causes Magic Damage and restores Magicka per enemy hit. Elemental Drain also restores Magicka however unlike Elemental Susceptibility upon activating the ability it will aggro the target upon casting the skill.You might want to utilize Energy Overload if you are still having sustain issues. Reduce Magicka ability cost glyphs on your jewelry pieces otherwise Magicka Recovery glyphs.Switching your secondary armor set could be necessary too. Shroud of the Lich is an amazing set in combination with Molag Kena that will significantly boost your Magicka Recovery when at below  Magicka once per  seconds. ,elderscrollsonline,d8biwma,1,t5_2tqi0

9175490,0,t3_55zszm,Crafting amp EconomyGeneral Increased the density of harvest nodes in Bleakrock Isle and Bal Foyen to better match other zones of the same size. Fixed an issue that caused harvest nodes to very rarely respawn immediately after being harvested. Fixed an issue where Intricate Shields were not providing the additional Inspiration or crafting materials expected of an Intricate item when deconstructed. Increased the minimum bid and the buyout price for a Guild Trader with no bids to  gold from  gold. Writ reward boxes will now more consistently drop Intricate or Ornate items based on your level or your passive similar most other rewards. Updated the Chef and Brewer vendors to sell CP greenquality recipes used in Provisioning crafting writs so it is based on the passive rank in Recipe Improvement. Fixed an issue in which some resources were respawning at a faster rate than intended within Toothmaul Gully. Updated many mushrooms throughout early zones to create a greater degree of fungal diversity. The highest rank of crafting Writ no longer requires access to Orsinium and is instead delivered to Belkarth in Craglorn.ampnbspAlchemy When an enchantment is suppressed by a poison the visuals for that enchantment are now also suppressed allowing the poison visuals to display correctly. Potion tooltips now reflect the cooldown reduction from any Alchemical Acceleration enchantments you have active. Snakeblood now properly reduces the durations of negative effect potions once more. Corrected the name of the active effect for Poisons of Ravage Health to Ravage Health instead of Drain Health. Added icons to several negative active effects that could appear on crafted potions which did not previously have their own icons. Clarified the names of several reagent traits.     Lower Spell Resist is now Lower Spell Resistance     Lower Armor is now Lower Physical Resistance     Spell Crit is now Spell Critical     Weapon Crit is now Weapon CriticalampnbspCrafting Writs The containers awarded for completing crafting writs no longer indicate their level as they all showed up as level .ampnbspSurvey Reports All survey reports now spawn six rich nodes. To balance out the reduction in number of nodes at hightier survey sites the amount of materials hightier rich nodes award has been increased. Fixed an issue that caused Lush plants at Clothier survey sites to produce more cloth than intended. This brings them back in line with similar nodes for other professions.     Furriers Traps are unaffected with the result that Clothier surveys still provide more combined materials than Blacksmith or Woodworker surveys. Survey Reports are no longer unique items and now stack to . Only one Survey Report will be used each time you approach and harvest the associated survey report site.,elderscrollsonline,d8f2756,5,t5_2tqi0

If you use the group finder to find members or to queue your full group for the dungeon the dungeon will be CP and anyone low level will be scaled up to CP.EDIT I totally missed you clearly writing PC in the title sorry about that! Okay so since youre on PC. EVERYWHERE is CP all the time. Everywhere. If you arent CP you are battle levelled up.

But the newbies are eager to join guild and play with them because they dont have friends and a lot people playing this game without team. So help them man it will make them really happy and thats the ESO community. Also I choose tank when I queue as dps sometimes if I am farming gold key.

I just see alot of the play how you want crowd bashing meta builds pretty frequently on here.Player skill certainly is a big factor but the power shift in eso from a good build to a bad one is more severe than in any other mmo Ive played.

9292503,0,t1_d8tmiyl,PvP doesnt get real development is left with exploitable bugs for months to years and they took out alliance restrictions.  The lack of restrictions means players logging characters from other alliances to use said year old exploit to get into keeps to take a scroll and die.  This allows the other alliance character from the keep alliance to pick it up and carry it to another alliance without anyone from that alliance being able to stop them unless they log a character from another alliance.  Which ZOS does nothing about but say clever use of mechanics.  But its not.  And they provide no way to combat traitors or exploiters.  Throw in cross alliance guild chat thats not disabled inside cyrodiil and them putting everyone together in dungeons and zones.  It doesnt make sense in a game that has PvP that is Alliance vs Alliance vs Alliance.  And before you say there are races in all Alliances you have to consider they have joined that Alliance.  And honestly the last real thing they added to PvP was IC.  Which was not a PvP expansion.  Its PvE with optional PvP.  Its mostly fighting NPCs and bosses.  Only thing added since then is some poorly placed domination flags that are poorly balanced location wise.  PvP is neglected and class and weapon balance is an after thought that Wrobel doesnt care about.Lastly Fior is trying to take an MMO with PvP and turn it into a Multiplayer ESO game with PvP being forgotten.

It also contains Puncturing sweeps a magicka templars top damaging ability that also provides a ton of self healing. I main a templar and for a very very long time I ran this kind of setup.

That means that someone in full impen is still taking . more damage from crits not to mention that there are templar and NB passives that would make that . more crit damage. Running the shadow would bump that to . assuming you run  divines.  points in elfborn would make that . bonus damage against enemies in  impen. Im not sure how you think that  bonus damage doesnt matter but a lot of people are like you and just go lolol impen gud crit in PvP is bad Im  PvP erin cuz I know crit sucks without doing math.Thats why as I said before crit is still very useful in PvP unless the group is running transmutation or spamming damage shields. Even against sorcs I still like having a high crit rating because once you drop their shields  of sorcs are wearing divines and infused.

9553276,0,t3_5bmsex,On both bars swap out bound armaments for the hunter skill from fighters guild. Youll get more damage from the crit chance bonus than from the extra stamina. Plus higher crit chance equals more healing from crit surge. My skill build is steel tornado camo hunter rapid strikes hurricane blood craze and rend on front bar poison injection camo hunter rearming trap crit surge endless hail and suppression field on back bar. Swap out camo hunter on back bar with dark deal if you have sustain issues. Swap out suppression field with flawless dawnbreaker if you dont need the enemy stun. Do not drop rearming trap because the crit damage bonus is huge on top of the dot damage. I can easily hit k self buffed without maelstrom weapons.,elderscrollsonline,d9qn003,1,t5_2tqi0

The main quest didnt work I had to log out and back in for half of the quests that sorta worked to clear some bad state the bank upgrades kept going away grouping for dungeons was nighimpossible without constantly disbanding and reforming and it was generally a clusterfuck and wasnt worth renewing my subscription but I did it twice in good faith anyways.  Three months after launch things were still bad so I cancelled and didnt come back until it went BP.  Great? LOL dont make me laugh.

We understand how and why the orbs were used based on peoples previous understanding and evaluation of the skill prior to the text change. And we understand that some people still use this skill in exactly the same way as before ... just because. We just want to be able to evaluate this for ourselves using some evidence or numberstesting that the community may already have. When something changes you shold reevaluate it right? Make sure its still useful practical fitforpurpose. Given were asking guild members to acquire certain skills we feel like we have a responsibility to make sure were not just aping established behaviours ... especially given a lot of what we read online is out of date for example the description for Guard on several major ESO websites or incorrect in context Thaumaturge CP buffs for Jabbyjabs on console.If you have any additional nonanecdotal information about mystic orb especially post text change or can point to it please let us know. Were hungry for it. Especially if you have answers to the questions above.We do use the other skills you mention individually we run endgame content with different guilds.

Ive always felt the TES games and Bethesda games in general really needed a sandbox rpg feel to be best experienced ever since Arena and well Terminator  if anyone remembers that the best Bethesda games have been sandbox rpgs so converting TESO into one was the best decision they made.Im still new but if anyone wants to join me in experiencing this game hit me up Mrobject.,elderscrollsonline,da94qoh,2,t5_2tqi0

9710234,0,t1_da9m4u7,I think this is the right approach as well but I also think the process shouldnt be free or even cheap.  It should cost at least one style material that matches the motif AND there should be a separate mat that works like waxalloyrosin where the more you put in the less chance of completely destroying the item.  Transmogging an item is essentially improving the item after all.  Also I think the tab should be enabled only after putting a skill point into a level  passive from the appropriate crafting skill tree.

9751214,0,t3_5esf3e,Play on PC.Maybe some games are better on consoles but you will have a much better experience playing ESO on a PC.Why?. Addons They will help you in ways that you would never achieve on consoles.. Its an MMO so you need a LOT of binded keys. Do you have a keyboard on a PS? P. Usersettings.txt You can tweak many of the games settings through that file. I cant confirm but Im pretty sure that this is not editable on consoles.. Lower player population on consoles since PS and XBox each have separate servers. All PC players share the same metaserver well one for NA and one for EU.. Much better hardware available on PC if you care about high definition graphics and details as well as a smooth experience when playing in an area with a lot of spells amp environmental effects flying around.. Did I say addons? Well I say it again ADDONS!!!! In my opinion the single most important reason why consoles are so popular is that many people do not care that much about graphics quality. They care more about the excitement they get from all that moving amp colorful stuff. Following the Nobel price winner that was Skyrim Elder Scrolls Online is trying to achieve a similar wow effect nothing to do with WoW in an MMO environment which is very challenging.

9808456,0,t3_5fpzef,gt Beyond endgame activities what does endgame gear progression look like? Gear cap is CP but theres plenty of good gear that you can only get from the hard endgame content vet trials vMA. gt Currently level ish crafting is a complete waste aside from researching Traits. We can just run off and man a dungeon to get set items scaled to our level so crafting a smattering of items with a single trait doesnt exactly seem useful. Correct. Until you reach a higher level there isnt much point in worrying about crafted sets right now. Just keep researching traits. Thats not to say that you cant craft sets just that they arent as beneficial at your level. gt I understand that we can craft set items eventually but what is required to do this? During endgame is crafting a better or worse source of gear than DungeonsTrials?Depends on the set you want to craft. The best trial set for the most part is TwiceBorn Star which lets you use two mundus stones at one time. That set cant be crafted unless you know  traits for each piece you want to craft.

For instance a Templar has an entire skill tree dedicated to healing which would make them the most optimal but other classes have access to the restoration staff skill line and can also make efficient healers. An optimal minmax build really only comes into play at end game content. The same can be said for tanking and DPS.Magplars are an excellent choice for solo play and are arguably the most flexible when it comes to filling roles within the current group composition.

9835897,0,t1_daplnr6,I dont think you understand how probability works. Say if there is a  chance of getting an apex mount from a crate made up  as there are no official numbers from zos. If you open  crates you arent guaranteed to have  apex mounts at the end. You might get none you might get .Each crate you open is an individual event with a  chance of getting that mount. It doesnt matter if youve opened  or  each one you open has the same chance of success and is not influenced by the outcome of any previous crates.You could literally blow through  crates and not get an apex mount in one of them granted you could easily cash in the junk you get and buy the mount that way but  isnt enough to guarantee a mount lol  Deltia.,elderscrollsonline,dapn1kl,9,t5_2tqi0

Half or so of the nodes should match your characters overall level while the other half will scale to the level of the associated crafting skill.So as a ridiculous example lets say you have a level  character that somehow has  skill points put into the first passive of max level blacksmithing I know this doesnt work mathematically levelingwise. In this case regardless of what zone youre in some of the blacksmithing nodes you encounter should be iron reflecting the armorweapon level your character should use while others will be rubedite reflecting your characters high crafting abilities.TLDR they scale to your character like the rest of the games content. Invest skill points in crafting passives or level your character to find higher level mats.,elderscrollsonline,davyfu4,1,t5_2tqi0

9909937,0,t1_daz9ln2,ok but what about imperial race templar healer it gets kicked in vet dungeons as well?,elderscrollsonline,dazado1,2,t5_2tqi0
9910210,0,t3_5hcup6,Imperial doesnt offer much to a healer as a race.  You probably want to look more towards say Argonian which has benefits to healing still has some extra health etc.  For PvP templar healer you WILL have a hShield on one of your bars its going to be your main bar too.  Put on Blazing Spear Breath of Life Mist Form Cleansing Ritual either morph extended is the usual and x slot to play around with possibly guard possibly channeled focus etc.  Your secondary bar can be more free form you can run a resto perhaps DW maybe a desto.  Youll want a few things here for sure namely repentance channeled focus if it wasnt on your front bar.  For big pvp healing youll probably mostly being using barrier as your ultimate of choice you get another ultimate so probably something more greedy like devouring swarm hShield ultimate whatever.  In organized groups youll probably end up with warhorn andor resto ulti as one of your ultimates. The rest of your abilities besides those mentioned can be lightly more free for choice.  Rapid Regeneration and Combat Prayer are decent resto abilities.  Toppling Charge Puncturing Sweeps Reflective Light Radiant Oppression and Dark Flare you can mix and match from those class damage abilities.  Destructive Reach can be a useful ranged CC option Crush Shock can and will absolutely get people upset if you are good with it and the desto ulti with good stats behind it can absolutely demolish people.  Invigorating Drain provides CC and ultimate generation it has slightly limited range but it can work well.I did mention mist form healplar in PvP  requires vampire to function without mist form you have ZERO escape besides walking away.  A huge aspect of PvP is tree humping and mist form makes this very possible you can kiterun away from multiple people nearly indefinitely with a good healplar build.  Its no streak but you gotta work with what you have which is LITERALLY NOTHING so go be a vampire.  You will run the Atronach mundus there is literally ZERO other options in this regard for healplar.  You will wear  piece heavy this is NOT optional. You can even run a full  heavy or go the traditional   light or .  You will absolutely get butt blasted without wearing heavy  hshield we are talking shot city from ganking nightblades and the like let alone trying to survive in big fights.  Generally you are going to wear x defensivemiddle of the read set like Reactive or Kagrenacs and x magicka set probably in your jewleryweapons maybe a belt.  Some good examples are ReactiveLich ReactiveDesert Rose Kagrenacs and the same two KagrenacsTransmutation Ive heard of people using Fasallas and other things too.  Warlock instead of Lich for a magick set can also work its less magicka but works better with mist form.  If you wanted to go more damage oriented you can look at Rattlecage and Soulshine though Im pretty sure Rattlecage is generally better than Soulshine.  Again combine them with your desired magicka set.  For your undauntedmonster set you have  options really.   Engine Guardian aka the classic gives you resources and you can repentance the corpse all around great monster set.   Chokethorn relatively new monster set that shoots a healing beam can also be repetanced and because of where it spawns basically ontop of you it can often eat an ability or two seeing your choke thorn eat a meteor meant for you never gets old.   Bloodspawn usually this is only used by those who opt for builds with Reactive armor and more tank oriented setups but it is effective in that situation.  Technically if you are going more damage oriented Skoria and Grothdar are the go to damage sets.Thats all well and good for PvP but for PvE you are going to use a few different skills and you are going to want some different gear too.  A healer in Light armor for PvE is just flat out better sets like Desert Rose and Soulshine do literally NOTHING for you.  Reactive armor is actively bad for a healer in PvE.  For PvE healing you want to be looking more towards Spell Power Cure the holy grail of PvE healing sets and some other group utility set perhaps Worm or something like that.Lets assume you have NOTHING and want to make this as budget as possible.  Seducers is relatively cheap and easy to makehave someone else make for you it will work in the place of Kagrenacs and be decent in both PvP and PvE consider  sets  in heavy with impen trait  in light with divine trait.  Then you just need a jewelryweapon set Transmutation is dirt cheap to buy on guild traders and just running hShield frontbar Resto backbar can be pretty generalized.  Just use whatever monster set you can hopefully its something useful and work towards your desired one over time.Something like this will be cheap and relatively easy to put together and it will work just fine for dungeons and such.Healing dungeons should be pretty easy keep up rapid regeneration keep up cleansing ritual make sure the tanks in the AoE keep up channeled focus and Breath of Life if anyone takes a spike of damage.  Burn a healing ultimate or some sort of shit hits the fan.  Throw out Blazing Spear ontop of the tank midway through the fight if you can.  If you have the chance and need magicka back do a full resto heavy attack.   For dungeonstrials youll hopefully get Necrotic Orb from the undaunted skill like and toss those out too for group magicka sustain but do so sparingly.  Witchmothers Potent Brew is a good general use food to look for since it really gives you everything you could want.  That said you are NOT going to be a good healer and dps at the same time.  You will either be a solid tanky healer but do meh damage in PvP or you will be a magicka dps that can sorta kinda heal.  Ive healed dungeons in full PvP gear before its possible.  That said I could probably heal most dungeons without sets just fine.  That said the difference in clear speed and ease of playing is there and if you arnt experienced and knowing what you are doing you could easily fuck things up without proper gear.  TLDR I make various gearskill suggestions and note that you are going to want two gear sets one for PvP and one for PvE.  ,elderscrollsonline,dazbnos,3,t5_2tqi0

9956507,0,t1_db5ae6s,Its a lot to take in at first but honestly you shouldnt bog yourself down with trying to learn it all at once. Starting out the biggest things you need to know are Feed your horse every day!  time sink in the game as you only get one training lesson per day. Typically the order is speed then carry capacity then stamina. However if you plan to do a lot of pvp you may want to prioritize stamina over capacity. Mounts are accountwide and mount stats are characterwide. This means any mount you have on one character you will have on all characters and for a particular character if you get to  speed all of the mounts on that character will have  speed.  If you plan to be a crafter begin your research early and prioritize whatever armor you favor. Stam dps medium. Mag dps light. Tank heavy. Enchanting takes the longest of any craft to level but its much more important to focus on the gear crafting lines first to get your research started assuming thats something youre interested in. ,elderscrollsonline,db5cwdr,1,t5_2tqi0

For crafting get Craftstore great mod for keeping track of researched traits and also get Dressing Room for creating multiple loadouts and configurations.At level  youll unlock weapon swapping on your second skillbar.  After that you can head to Cyrodiil for your lions share of PvP gameplay if thats what youre looking for.  Just make sure your home campaign is the under one.Like I said earlier youre going to be needing those skyshards and youll can now to run each zone to grab them.

9959297,0,t3_5i6b8j,What exactly is your problem with it? In any MMO there will always be a best way to do something. Youre right the stam dps does play very similarly. Why? Because you only get a few skills from your class lines that have stamina morphs and for the rest of your skills you must rely on the weapon abilities. If you want more variety play a magicka class. There will still be some crossover in attacks you use wall of elements namely but they are definitely more varying than stam. ,elderscrollsonline,db5q0ch,4,t5_2tqi0
9959595,0,t1_db5j11s,Agreed on Ebon absolutely. The question is the other  set. Mansworth was asking about pairing Ebon with Diagna which is not a great second  set for a tank because it doesnt help a tank much and it doesnt help the group at all.  The only thing Diagna helps with is more incoming heals but as you said a tank should not cannot really rely on that to get through intense damage spikes. You need to up your mitigation use shuffle keep a damage shield up etc.For that reason Dragon Alkosh or Tavas are better second  sets for Tanks.  ,elderscrollsonline,db5req0,1,t5_2tqi0

9966827,0,t3_4px35l,I complete maelstrom in  minutes or about that.  I dont mind the drop rate and the traits I get are never training or prosperous so I cant really complain there other than getting charged trait which is useless  percent on a maelsteom enchant which has a  percent proc rate or cant be affected by charged anyways and Ive done maelstrom over  times.  The only thing that bugs me is that of the times Ive done it Ive gotten  Ice Staves  nirnhoned  precise and one charged two h weapons an inferno staff powered a sword sharpened and a maul powered.  Ive gotten over  bows with every enchant except sharpened over  resto staves with every trait possible no prosperous or training and about the same amount of sword and boards which feed my resin count for crafting.   nirnhoned h axe and  infused dagger.  The only thing that bugs me is that it seems ZOS is aware that sharpened is the best trait and it shouldnt be like that.  If a trait is so over powered or all other traits are so under powered they should nerf or buff something to bring them all in line.  So while I can flawless maelstrom arena without even trying on xbox and Ive done maelsteom over  times I still dont have the traits I want.  The only other thing that bugs me is people whining that theyve done it  times.  Or whining that it takes too long.  Or whining about what ever.  You can complain when you get over  runs and can complete it in  minutes and get a flawless run.  And dont go complaining that you lag out or your game crashes.  I have the same issues and I can still do it.  Leave in game chat party turn off all combat scrolling text and dont take the quest your chance of game crashes is much much lower.  ,elderscrollsonline,db6pcgs,1,t5_2tqi0

Want to just explore the  amazing sights and save some poor npcs from a life of despair? Smell the flowers and get murdered by sprigans? Just pick a zone and start walking. D There is alot of content to explore here. And a ton of things to farm if that is your style. There is a special place in my heart for grinding dungeons. Esp the hard ones. PvP is fun. Even if you end up dieing in a ball of poison and fire somtimes. What matters most is if you run with the right people tho. The company you keep can seriously make a huge difrence.

Pushing the limits is what addon developers should be doing.  Even if they did take issue with measuring stealth characters the KoS list is pretty neat.  I remember using Jumper at launch. The API used to allow us to jump to ourselves. So you could be anywhere and teleport to the nearest wayshrine. ZOS does react if they see something they dont like. They swiftly removed this ability. If players take issue let them know.  What you did is kind of cool at least from a developer standpoint. I dont think I have seen it before. I think the people here are going to downvote you into oblivion and I can see where the worry comes from. People dont like it when they feel addons become required.

From the same DLC you get clemency to get out of sticky situations.Guards are annoying but they are there to keep things on the edge for us thieves.

Sets like grothdar and illambris allow people to have sloppy rotations but still have vmol viable caliber dps.gt All of the time spent farming for those sets were for nothing.... Stop. You and I both know these sets will still be viable just not as ridiculously powerful. Even if I am wrong and these sets arent viable anymore youre acting as if just because you spent some time farming that that set needs to be viable forever.

10139855,0,t3_5l5nuy,Hey Rowdy I was going to answer in slack then saw this so...The sets mentioned by Raith are a good target list minus tbs. Definitely not tbs on a healer. And possibly not kena see below.For leveling anything magicka works well enough. I always level magicka characters using  seducer and  of whatever magnus julianos anything you like. The cost reduction from seducer is nice when you are grinding.Once you are out of training traitleveling needs you have a gap between current gear and the ultimate list of farmeddropped sets youll need. Thats the list Raith gave you. Your best bet is to get  kagrenacs lower body and headshouldersstaves torugs pact and throw on  willpower jewelry for now. As soon as you find a monster set piece you like head or ahoulders exchange that for one of the torugs pieces and Youll have that bonus while still maintaining  torugs for the spell power bonus. you could do magnus or seducer instead  pick a set with a  piece bonus you want and make  of it until you get a desirable monster piece  Kena was always the go to with  piece spell damage bonus. After T there are others as well. Grothdarr or illambris for max magicka another for magicka recovery. Go with what you feel helps you the most.Then you start looking at dropped sets. Spell power and worm should be your first two priorities if you have a desire to heal trials. Ultimately youll want to be able to do spell power and worm or spell power and infallible aether to coordinate with the other trials healer but you have to run trials for infall so start with worm.  Try to get spell power rings. Its a hassle but trust me youll appreciate the advice when you DONT need to worry about infall rings later. Also once you get to trials if the other healer is wearing spc and worm youll still be able to do spc and a crafted set until you get infall.If any of that doesnt make sense hit me up here or on slack.Edit if you arent worrying about trials I can give you several fun healer gear combos that Ive played with that arent the meta builds but are still enjoyableand effective.,elderscrollsonline,dbt8766,1,t5_2tqi0

If you have access to the Craft Bag through ESO Plus you can now deconstruct items and refine materials even when your inventory is full. The Keen Eye visual effect will now fade out more smoothly when you move out of range of the associated harvest node. Shipments of refined materials from Crafting Writs can now be quickslotted and appear in the Consumables section of the inventory. Updated the tooltip text on the Ghastly Eye Bowl to properly indicate that its increasing your Magicka Recovery not your Stamina Recovery. Eyeballs are not stamina food. Tell your friends.ampnbspAlchemy Fixed an issue that caused potions of Vitality or Defile to incorrectly compete with the Minor Protection buff. Fixed an issue that caused crafted Ravage Health poisons to deal roughly twice as much damage as intended over their full duration. Fixed an issue where the tooltip duration for potions would not change after acquiring the Medicinal Use passive.ampnbspProvisioning Psijic Ambrosia and Mythic Aetherial Ambrosia can now be used while moving.

They try to find workarounds to the space limit they have. My information is fairly reliable you dont have to believe me but dont expect any inventorybank increases in the near future. The crafting bag works because it is an entirely new inventory that they built only for crafting materials in theory maybe they could make a gear bag but as for expanding the inventory and bank system they currently have the size is limited. ,elderscrollsonline,dc00jfw,0,t5_2tqi0

Strife can be useful in the first levels but youre going to drop it real soon unless you want to be a Magicka Nightblade. Im a Stamina Nightblade and I used strife only for the first levels. After a while you wont need that skill anymore because you need to favour the DPS. The only lifesteal skill I have is Killers Blade.

10375820,0,t3_5ol6rf,. Poisons only proc of light and heavy attacks NOT abilities of any kind.. Does not proc off abilities poisons only apply to a single individual.. Immobilize means makes skills unavailable for  second. its really not long enough to notice it since you ambush and people typically dodge roll or it takes a second for them to realize they are under attack. No follow ups for ambush really besides surprise attack since it is a huge damage dealer or sometime i like to ambush then fear then attack but it changes with each enemy.. you make poisons for what you want them to do. That poison that ppl suggest is because it drains resources of the opponent making them easier to kill if they have no sustain.. Widowmaker is bomb as fuck no matter what you run it with. I run it with viper and i literally one shot people when it procs out of stealth on my nightblade. On my dk i run it with vildreth and dreaugh king slayer and im one tough bitch to kill. Viper is somewhat bugged right now because sometimes it will proc off your weapons enchantment and your weapon at the same time so thats when you see two viper sting within one ability of each other on your death recap when it is supposed to have a  second cooldown... still op. I only use poisons with my widowmaker set and even then i dont craft them myself i just use the abundance of shit i get from bosses everywhere because you go through A LOT of poison. Another thing with widowmaker is you can get it to proc on one bar and then switch weapons and it will proc again off the new weapon. It is super fun to use.,elderscrollsonline,dck5uv3,2,t5_2tqi0

10437084,0,t3_5pfoad,Leave a couple of heavy armor pieces on but go full light when you can. Make sure your skills you use in combat complement the new armor. Its about adjusting your play style now. Use the Aedric Spears abilities they are good. Puncturing Sweeps is good and spammable and other skills are similarly useful. I first started out using Aurora Javelin while expensive to give my squishy ass some distance between enemies. Also the last skill in Aedric Spears is a shield. If you arent already consider destructive staves as another weapon. In light armor its better if you use ranged attacks. Destructive ReachdDestructive Clench with and Inferno staff provides knockback so enemies cant close the gap to get at you easily. If youre really worried about your light armor skill strap on some and join a dolmen group in Auridon or the Alikr Desert and grind that experience for that. Once you level your light armor enough I highly recommend grabbing the active ability in that tree. It gives you a nice shield to make up for some squishiness.Sorry for the large block of text but I hope its useful! Source Am a Magplar who started out exactly as you did and switched to light armor. edit also thought of this if you wanted to keep wearing heavy armor you might be able to do  piece of medium armor and take the Undaunted Mettle passive.

10438319,0,t3_5p7sy1,Ive run a NB healer in pvp effectively. Basically ran healing springs as main heal obviously only works when youve got a group that can stay tight and NB skills more for stunsdebuffs. Basically the rotation goes healing spring spam  lotus fan  fear  sap mixing in for sorcery buff but if your group isnt taking a lot of damage at the time you can be the judge of hitting more dps at times  and back to healing spring spam. Then use soul tether on resto bar healing passive  strong ccheal and lotus fan into a group and pop it to cc them all as your group pushes up and you go back to healing spring spam. Can put destro ult on back bar and when you need more damage pop that and I promise youll kill people even if you do nothing but go back to healing springs for the duration. Then obviously mix in your fearssapswhatever back bar dps youve got depending on what your group is against. For CP I will tell you my blue tree is set up for a dps not a healer but you honestly dont need more than  points or so in blessed to get your springs ticking for ksecond if youve got good gear and with anywhere from  stacked at a time thats basically an continuous ulti heal. FULL DISCLAIMER My NB obviously doesnt call itself a healer as its main purpose more like I toss on a resto staff when weve got no one else and this works. Healing springs  healing springs  fear  repeat  probably the pugiest way to heal but its pretty damn effective with the right group ,elderscrollsonline,dcr99rr,2,t5_2tqi0

10463383,0,t3_5pve2w, It gets on my nerves when people expect me to craft them all they need without paying at all. Its like they treat me as an npc. I spent a lot of time to become a master crafter and the benefit of free crafting is only for me thank you very much. When you want something crafted please do your research first. Dont come to me for build therapy I dont know what is best for you and quite honestly I dont care i did at first but after the th player who didnt know what he wanted but wanted something crafted and made me spend one hour explaining builds to reach the conclusion he wanted a dropped set all along made me quite the cynic when it comes to customer service. When you contact a crafter dont go afk. It drives me crazy when I ask details and they give me a partial answers and then go afk. If you do that I will just ignore you like you ignore me. lastly if you steal nodes while I fight the mobs above the node then you are a jerk and I wish someone does the same to you all the time. Rant over . Wow who knew this could be so cathartic. Edit another thing I remembered. How can some people sell glass motifs for less than k? I mean only the potion to combine the pieces for a chapter costs k. Dont blindly follow master merchant people it only needs a few idiots to sell lower than the cost and after that its downhill. Try to see what mats cost and put a price accordingly. Same goes for potions and XP pots.

10483263,0,t1_dcvfexb,I didnt tell anybody how to play. I said that relying on shards is a bad practice and results in a shit build. Its my opinion and I am every bit as entitled to it as you are to yours. Not every healer is a Templar. If youve spent as much time as is needed to complete all the content on all roles youd realize this. Not a Templar means no shards. Not a Templar means no repentance. Not having either of these does not mean bad healer. They may not be meta and they may not be good for vet trials but and I know this can be difficult to understand not everybody wants to do that part of the game. Some people are perfectly happy not doing endgame content. If you RELY on shards you have a shit build in my opinion. Theyre nice to have. If your healer has them they should use them as long as the tank is good then DPS can grab but if DPS is grabbing before the tank and the tank drops because of it.... is it really this fucking hard to understand what Im saying or are you just trying to win? ,elderscrollsonline,dcwdwxn,-1,t5_2tqi0

Until veteran ranks it doesnt matter all that much what you wear. Once youre  you should grab training traits since you should bumrush to  and most of your exp will mostly likely now come from grinding mobs to do so. Keep gear up to snuff is much more important as you level CP to  so save your goldgems for now.Weapon is the most important piece make sure its with a damage trait on it so try to improve it every few levels. A good rule of thumb is just to do it if you feel like your kill speed or survivability drop low.

You can ask for MM prices but will be hard to get a good idea as not many will be sold in stores and they are very rare so price will vary wildly so just try to get as much as you can for it  someone will pay  for it eventually. You might want to just bank it for a little while until you get more used to  sales from watching zone chat maybe practice trading smaller items so you know what youre doing when it comes to your big trade.

10686264,0,t3_5svpog,According to ZenimaxTradeskill mastery which determines your odds of receiving a master writ from a top tier writ reward box is meant to imply a longterm dedication to the craft. This varies from tradeskill to tradeskill.For Blacksmithing Clothier and Woodworking this means motif knowledge and overall completion of trait research. This does not include Crownexclusive motifs or motifs for the  base player races. It focuses on motifs that take some effort to learn  like Xivkyn or Minotaur or Celestial.For Provisioning this is instead your collection of known purple and gold recipes as they are a strong overall representation of dedication to craft.With Enchanting we instead look at the total overall rune word translations youve completed on that character.And with Alchemy we look at how many reagents from which youve completely learned all effects.Over time the contributing factors for this may expand as the associated tradeskill mechanics do.SOURCE ,elderscrollsonline,ddi7i0r,2,t5_2tqi0

Being able to freely change the trait of an item is too big an advantage. Choosing the trait and set of crafted items is completely sufficient.

Im more a rangedplayed so I do magic classes or healing though I do do tanking sometimes. Maybe you have been playing the class that is not for you? As far as loading scenes goes that happens with any mmo. ESO has loading screens. By loading screens I mean when you load the game takes awhile and then when you have to wait to get a party for dungeons etc...loading scenes are pretty much in every mmo.  But the only loading scenese you get in ffxiv is when you do dungeonsraids. The actual world is seamless except for a couple zones but ffxiv is quite seemless its pretty much when you have to go to other regions like if youre in the Black Shroud and want to travel to UlDah. Its completely seamless but when you hit UlDah there will be a loading screen to load that region.ESO does have an auction house.

10784040,0,t3_5u8lwm,I dont like to kick people which is why I will simply leave if I believe that a group is setup for failure.  Some dungeons have serious DPS checks and unavoidable damage to heal through.  Just because it felt easy on normal a couple times does not mean you are ready for veteran dungeons.  In fact I would posit that you have no reason to even try veteran dungeons yet.  You will not get level capped gear and it will most likely be a slow and painful process.Even once you hit  you should probably stick to the normal dungeons for random queuing and specific veteran dungeons the standard  versions for the experience and to chase the gear you need for your build.  Most of the s and all of the expansion dungeons would most likely chew you up and spit you out by the first boss.,elderscrollsonline,ddsamxp,2,t5_2tqi0

Then they sorta double downed on this living world story thing no new dungeons no new armor sets unless you buy them from cash store. Then GW launches in China to cater to their market they change quite a number of things like spreading out skills across levels having to unlock various basic functions that NA had from level  but no no we wont be making those changes to the NA version of the game. Few months later I roll up a new alt and the gimped new player experience is in full effect. I tried playing HOT and its fun but that early level grind with Alts is terrible.

You need someone else in the group to be a Templar.You will not be asked to heal vet trials or vDSA.You will get salt from pugs sometimes and some people will kick you for not being a Templar. Get a good guild.Eventually you will roll a Templar to see what the fuss is about. You will be amazed and appalled at how much easier it is to heal on a Templar. You will respec your Magblade for pvp and shudder to recall your healing past. The thing you need to keep in mind is that the  job of a good healer is not healing. It is sustaining the groups resources and providing buffs. Templars can restore stamina magica health purge debuffs and buff the group.

10823970,0,t3_5umhoc, Server EU  PC Faction crossfaction Type of Guild social PvE Current member number After a quite long period without any advertisement about us on the last day of the year I hereby restart recruiting. Our guild the WEB is an international Englishspeaking social kind of guild founded in Spring  now with over  members with  max.  active. Our main goal was to create a fun community based on thievery sadly there werent any contentelements implemented which would have helped this goal so we reformed ourselves as a semiactive general guild. Yesterday we finished our first inguild trialrun with just one player out of the community so I got some motivation to resurrect our thread here.We had an outofgame forum which we closed because of the lack of interest and because we never used that for registration our registration procedure always starts here or ingame write your application and thats it so some of us shared some informations about us gameplay etc. but mostly those can be found on the internet so nothing really important things are written there. About us in short we have players with characters from every class race role and playstyle we have members from all of the alliances while we are mainly PvEoriented so this wont carries anything importance. We have newly created but always used rules mostly about friendly behaviour nodrama norudeness etc. Our players are friendly social chatty and mainly mature guys and girls  lots of us with family job and pet so our frequent playing hours are in the evening.We have some quite wealthy members so it cant be a problem to help our other members out in almost anything were bidding on public trader to help our Threads to sell their wares and.... thats it.My next plan to create a fix men group for regularly doing trials for loot and fun it would be cool if we could run around in Cyrodiil and I always have a lot of ideas in mind from the funbutnoXPbutdecentrewardtype guildevents some of those giveawayish.TLDR We need more active players it is better if youre over the CP but its not a problem if youre below it weve never told anything bad to those members who were quite newbie even if they were over lvl. If you want to be our member you should be active in the evening hours able and keen to do group content do not be arrogant and disrespectful try to not be childish while we arent against humour. Have no fear if youre basic in English we wont force you to use any voiceoverInternet Protocol VoIP software please just be quick in typing If you feel yourself tired of forced joining procedure you never liked if you were regulated but you can conduct yourself and you are able to greet your guildmembers and you think you would like to strengthen our thieves army and want to be a part of a nice community write a message in our official forumthread but preferably in the game to PainDragon.,elderscrollsonline,ddwf002,1,t5_2tqi0

10849059,0,t3_5v3m31,The biggest benefit from crafting is not crafting crafted sets but cheaply improving your equipment. The answer to your title is still yes.,elderscrollsonline,ddz05fm,2,t5_2tqi0
10849220,0,t3_5v3fyd,.  Flour. Pretty much every provisioning furnishing needs  pieces of flour. But give it a couple of days for people to actually get some recipes and realize just how much they need this stupud flour.. Containers  same as for basic motifs and old provisioning. Wardrobes backpacks  nightstands etc. Nothing new here.. Blueprints  what you cannot buy from vendors they sell some recipes but those can be drops too so do your research. For now progression of prices between whites to gold is the usual one. Do not expect prices to stay high after the first week. Furniture recipes are not rare at all so the market will saturate fast. Prices will drop fast so do not hold off. If you are interested in gold more than in decorations do not use recipes on first week and sell them all. You will be able to buy them for waaaay cheaper than you sold them. There are over  recipes so it will take some time to figure out which greens are rare and which purples are shit so I would not worry about that. Also not really related but I feel the need to warn you check stolen items for furnishing before selling. Decorations like inkwells and quills can be stolen from desks and they sell quite well. So mouseover your stolen loot to launder all furnishings.. I picked Sleek Creek House as my main residence  it is near Rawlkha aka one of the best cities for doing crafting writs and it exits directly to Outlaw Refuge door so you can have huge bounty on you and full bags of stolen goods and never worry about meeting a guard on the way to fence. Just port to your house from anywhere and go to Refuge. Also it has great outdoor area and you can do a lot with it. House itself is on the smaller side but courtyard makes up for it tenfolds. Also because this one is a khajit so khajitthemed house was a priority And a bit of PSA just in case  you can have all three starting apartments for free if you have alts. Even if those apartments are a size of broom closet  free is free yes?,elderscrollsonline,ddz0qw3,12,t5_2tqi0

Did a couple of dungeons delves and some quests and these are approx. numbers for about  rubedite ore for example I may have got  or  Regulus. The same kind of ratio for other nodes too...Maybe it was just me being in Wrothgar that yielded low household mats.That being said a lot of new patternsdiagrams etc. were popping out in various chests dungeons etc. Happy furniture crafting!,elderscrollsonline,de2aai5,1,t5_2tqi0

Theres no DW or H skills there and it just becomes a matter of wanting that extra weapon for extra set pieces or enchants or if you want the potential ability to fit rally somewhere.

10974713,0,t1_debylv8,Errr...no not at all? WoW was specialized but every class had multiple roles which were perfectly viable for endgame. I mean a druid could be a perfectly viable tank melee DPS ranged DPS or healer. In many situations they would even be BiS. Yes back when I played feral melee DPS rotation was INSANELY complex. But they could do it. Some placed druid tanks were BiS other places warrior tanks and so on. Any class capable of tanking was capable of tanking endgame stuff and was wanted. Not critical but definitely not negligible. In fact the more variety you had the better your raid tended to perform.That is not true for ESO. I also think ESO is far more specialized than WoW. WoW for one had dualspec and builtin gear manager. That is at a push of a button you could turn your tank Druid into a healer Druid. Your action bars would change your gear would automatically swap without cluttering up your inventory too! and your talents would change accordingly. You were specialized for the role here and now but you could extremely easily adapt to another role on the fly. Only one other role true but still better than ESOs system where you can play the way you want which boils down you can get any color you want as long as its black. Druid in WoW was unique in that it could do everything yes. And other classes were typically restricted to  roles max tank melee DPS for Warrior tank melee DPS and healer for Paladin etc but WoW also had  classes at launch to ESOs . So all in all Id say WoW was still in a much better place than ESO. Which is supported by WoWs concurrent  mil subscribers to ESOs . lifetime sales.,elderscrollsonline,debzngu,1,t5_2tqi0

10974934,0,t1_debxwth,About WoW tanks while warriors have been the classic and probably most played tank they are far from being the only choice in top content. It changes with patches and expansions.Sure it might have been at the top more often but there were full raid tiers months where another tank could have been on top. I stopped playing WoW like a month ago but at that time warriors certainly werent at the top. Druids were undoubtedly miles ahead. And except for maybe worldrealm firsts and cutting edge progression every and all tanks have been able to do the vast majority the content since their release even Mythic raids excluding maybe vanilla were warriors were kind of the only tanks. Having DKs with handers being better than warriors really wouldnt be too surprising I even think they are right now or not long ago.The meta certainly has an impact far too much imo but in terms of tanks all tanks are viable even for high content even if there are better choices in general. Just this expansion monk tanks have been considered pretty weak and requiring a high skill for low reward for a few patches yet I still saw some monk tanks in top tier guilds maybe not world first race levels.Not everything has to be the same but the gap could be smaller. Again with WoW the last few weeks I was following rwow I watched the new patch changes and how they were received. Turns out the gap in dps between all the classes was MUCH smaller than previously with the very last few classes not being that far behind for anything but absolute top progression. Yet a few months before that classes like shadow priest which werent even remotely good dps a long time ago absolutely crushed the competiton up to like  more dps than the worst dps specs on nearly every boss of the first raid.,elderscrollsonline,dec0h6h,0,t5_2tqi0

10977428,1,t3_5wn03u,So heres the thing... My guild mates and I are some pretty serious PvPers. We live and breathe PvP new builds we foam at the mouth when discussing the new vv Battlegrounds were all broke because we rarely if ever leave Cyrodiil.This no CP week so far has been a joke. I crashed so hard last night my bloody XB turned off!! We were crashing during all major battles in load screens minutes long from pm to am EST not just peak times. Frame rate was dropping during open field battles animations were occasionally not going off at all think proxy and destro ULT. Considering this a stress test Im wondering if theres more going on behind the scenes but I dont think theyll get the results they want. Taking out CP forces you to run in a Zerg and that is known to cause problems. Not to mention this is the first week since theyve taken out two campaigns so the populations have increased across the board. My guild and I all have at least a star weve been grinding champion points and ranks since . and were all ESO members.

Keep in mind the best weapon to use is the one that matches your skills.  If you are using skills that consume magicka you should be using a staff weapon.  If you use stamina skills use melee weapons or bow.   The reason for this is that Heavy attacks with your weapon regen the stat pool for that weapon type.  stammagFor professions it depends on what you want to do.  If you plan to craft armor for yourself it can be hard to keep up.  It may be better to just use lootedquested equipment for a while unless you have a friend that can make you some decent equipment.I recommend starting research on traits right away but not necessarily spending skill points in Professions otherwise.  When you start having spare skill points because you have all the skillspassives you need at the time you can use the extras for Profession points.,elderscrollsonline,dedeqym,2,t5_2tqi0

Go to alcasthq.com and check out his windwalker build and look at the videos too. Pay close attention to the order he uses the skills. I think that will help a lot.

11014283,0,t1_degehum,And remember CP will make a huge difference you are cp behind the cap dont aim for k its just not possible P also do keep in mind you will get even better sustain the higher your CP. And yes it is a bit unfair at max CP you wouldve reached around k dps easily with the same rotation... I am not telling you to grind CP but... shits op yo. From your spelldmg numbers I can tell you dont have a gold staff believe me gold staff is a k dps.Since you are practicing in a skeleton dummy you will need to use Elemental Drain on it if you want to sustain otherwise in group combat your healer should have Ele Drain or the templar skill that applies magickasteal. Since you need to have at least one destro skill in your bar to get the passives  what I usually do is Force Pulse on main barinferno staff and Ele Drain in my back barlightning staff. Keep in mind that magblades dont have that good of sustain without siphoning attacks sadly but force pulse synergizes very well with it because it counts as  different hits. I usually swap sap essence for siphoning attacks in boss fights. I also dont simply spam it because its a dps loss I use it before the fight and only use it when Im below  magicka.I would like to recommend you another setup this is my personal setup and I think some people will probably disagree with me. I dont use a monster set since the nerfs... Before I think the AoE was too good to pass up but without the crits to the sets and the buff to our AoE class skill I think its worth the shot. I use  JulianosBSWmaelstrom but probably in a setup like that the best DPS would be BSWNecropotence or NecropotenceScathing Mage but scathing is a pain to farm and its bound so... RIP. Youd have to use Shadow Image to use Necro though this is the only disadvantage  some people raging at you because your pet is stealing their buffs which they dont you can research a bit if you want.But more importantly have fun man.

11035137,0,t3_5xkf8j,Templar is quite slow in movement with no class speed boosts to its own so youll have to use Elusive Mist from Vampire skills if you want any semblance of speed.Other than poor speed its got the best burst healing with some powerful damage behind it. You cant kill people as easily as say a magSorc but youll find it easier to survive and kill people just with more effort and strategy required while magSorc has trouble surviving hits.Perhaps a Templars most valuable skill for survivability is Extended Ritual a skill that cleanses any  negative effects from yourself and its an AoE healovertime that slows enemies down if they enter it and increases your own healing done with all class passives unlocked anyway.,elderscrollsonline,deit3en,3,t5_2tqi0

Also for the st sentence let me just add a note you just need to have not use a skill for that skill line in your action bar when you get EXP to level up the skill lines but that only applies to class skill lines weapon skill lines and armor skill lines. For the other skill lines you must fulfill the leveling requirements to level them up. No. Actually using skills have NO effect on leveling the skill line. Not sure which video youre referring to here. Id actually advice the same  buy mount upgrade riding skills upgrade inventory andor bank space.

11106920,0,t3_5yk2nk,It might be a game ratings thing. I think allowing violence to children in games is really taboo. From what I can tell a game where violence happens to children like Telltales Walking Dead is okay but one where the player can inflict it really isnt. Even The Sims limits the ways children can die and just has them get taken by the social worker in most cases.Of course they could just make the kids unkillable like in Skyrim but ... maybe it still puts them at risk for criticism if there are glitches or players managing to make things look inappropriate and they dont feel that its worth the trouble.A really extreme example of this is in the first Silent Hill game. The Grey Child monsters in the school apparently looked too much like children to be acceptable in Europe and Japan although they were allowed in the US.

Its by far the strongest DOT in the game literally an order of magnitude better than any multitarget DOT and on par with ultimate abilities in damage output. It does a Crippling Grasp amount of damage to  targets for the same cost. You could safely use that ability one time every ten seconds in veteran dungeons and deal as much damage as the DPS players while you actively healing like a Templar and buffing the entire group like a dedicated support and shrugging off damage. Its fun but it really just highlights how terrible a lot of the other classes skills are. The group buffs alone are going to make your allies abilities redundant. Major defensive buffs that last  seconds  higher health for everyone in combat insane passive damage constant and substantial healing as well as huge breath of life sized targeted burst healing... It already feels like they need to go back and fix how shitty the other classes are at certain roles.

11177655,0,t3_5zlc8i,Fighting in a Dwarven ruin? You have two enemies your opponents and the ruins themselves.  Merric atAswala  Battlegrounds are coming to The Elder Scrolls Online Morrowind including three unique maps at launch. To help you prepare for the battles to come we are featuring Vvardenfells battlefields all month. The first map to be covered? The mysterious Dwarven ruins of Ald Carac.  WATCH EVERY CORNER  Ald Carac is designed to encourage players to engage in tight close combat and the stone walls and buildings of the longabsent Dwarven race block line of sight and provide a lot of cover for surprise attacks or quick getaways.The deeper you travel into the Dwarven ruins the more cramped and claustrophobic the space becomes. As a result the center of the Battleground is a hotspot for group fights. Circled by an elevated walkway the center is vulnerable to players above meaning those trying to control this space need to keep an eye above for attackers at all times. This elevated threat makes the center very hard to capture and hold.The center of the map is not completely without advantage however as it is the only location that allows an unobstructed view into each teams base. In Ald Carac visibility is at a premium making controlling the center an important but dangerous strategic option. All Battlegrounds are vv matches so knowing exactly where your opponent is located is vital regardless of the game type.Ald Carac slowly opens up the further out from the center you go. The middle ring has more space but it still features a fair amount of cover including stairs up to the center overlook that grants vision into two bases. The outer ring finally provides mostly unobstructed views so you can always travel around the outside of the map if your team wants to avoid surprises.  PATH TO VICTORY  In Team Deathmatch there are no objectives to focus everyones attention and because the map is so enclosed the first thing you and your squad will need to do is try to locate both of the enemy teams. You might think it best to avoid the maps deadly center however if your team manages to control that space and the visibility it provides it will give you a clear advantage.Domination is a different matter. While three of the capture points are on the outer ring between each teams base the fourth one is right in the center. If you do manage to take the center capture point retreating out and defending it from the elevated walkway above might be the best option. Constantly moving from point to point will also help to avoid being caught between the other two teams.In Capture the Flag Ald Caracs tight spaces and cover can certainly benefit a flag carrier but it also makes it hard to avoid ambushes or clever defenders. Because each teams flag is located right at their base the clear sightlines available in the center will help you identify the best time to attack and defend but it might not be as safe as navigating around the sides.  HOW WILL YOU NAVIGATE THE DWARVEN RUINS?  Ald Carac with its high walls and tight spaces represents a unique challenge to its competitors. Do you take the open paths around the edges? Or are you willing to dive right into the center and control the maps heart? How your team decides to navigate the ruins could be the difference between victory and defeat. We have a lot more information coming so keep an eye out for more details on the individual Battlegrounds this month and please feel free to share your thoughts with us on the official forums or on Twitter TESOnline.,elderscrollsonline,deyz3ic,11,t5_2tqi0

For tanking vet content I double sword and  board bar  is repentance both bars for passive evasion forget what I morphed to pierce armor need aggro harness magicka annulment morph and the rune that buffs resistances. Bar  I have repentance extended ritual breath of light great for healing support blazing spear and the spell that casts the light down on an enemy collects as you damage them then huts then for k damage forget the name. Ultimate I usually do aggressive Warhorn empowering sweep I take Tri stat food that was given to me by provisioners in my guild. Im cp right now. I love the tank build its a lot of fun very active and more focused on damage mitigation than damage absorption like most traditional dk tanks and I have yet to fail from a survival  squishy perspective. With food and buffs etc. I come in around k health primarily wearing heavy armor with health  healing taken bonuses and a light  medium piece for passives. Im on mobile and at work so dont have time to look everything up but my cp is mostly in spellphysical resistance block cost reduction thaumaturge increase healing taken. Im sure many others will tell me why its not viable long term but I am having a ton of fun and have completed most vet dungeons with this build. I am collecting busts while I grind up to cp and beyond. Plus with a few thousand gold I can respect cp change armor and go all in  healer for tougher end game content.Edit add With a few tweaks I have also tankhealed some dungeons allowing us to bring  dps and stomp through them. I have only done this for normal dungeons but its a ton of fun. Never tried for vet dungeons. Obvious Downside is you do zero damage. ,elderscrollsonline,df0gvb6,1,t5_2tqi0

11236434,0,t3_60dtes,Theyve been pretty clear in pointing out that this expansion is just as much intended to be for newer players picking up the game for the first time as more experienced players looking for a challenge. To that end I wouldnt expect the main story to be too challenging. Experienced players will get Battlegrounds and the new Trial as their challenege. The next DLC likely in August or September will be a dungeon pack and DLC dungeons thus far have been the most challenging and not new player friendly. Q November or December will be a content pack my guess would be an Arena would be included in that since only one dlc so far hasnt included either a trial  dungeons or an arena. So Id expect the storyline to be more akin to Orsinium  often cited as the best ESO dlc than Craglorn because otherwise they arent really giving newermore casual players much to do this year.,elderscrollsonline,df5mu91,2,t5_2tqi0

11253278,0,t3_60kx0r,I would simply focus on doing the quests. You are not even close to being at a level where you need complete sets. Right now use armor sets that you find that help with magic ie magic enchantment or trait that boosts your magic. EVERYTHING else you will want to deconstruct at a crafting station in order to level up your crafting skills. Save as much as you can right now. If you find that you are running out of space make another character that will just hold items. Do some research before and make the build as if you intend to use it one day as opposed to some random crap one. As for items you cant deconstruct ie rings trash necklace sell them.Unlock abilities you find might be helpful. You can always reset them and get your skill points back for redistribution. For now just level that all up. As you get familiar with your build understand your rotation ie order in which skills are used most effectively and get better gear start running around in Public Dungeons. From there test the water in a Normal Dungeon. You shouldnt try vet level at all yet.,elderscrollsonline,df7jj6z,1,t5_2tqi0

11292149,0,t3_613jz5,I will review the first tree Looks very rogueish intruding into Nightblade territory in the Vipers Shivs tree. I hope that the first ability has very short duration for Fracture debuff or a very long animation do it once at start of combat kinda thing. why does a Bard have scythes? Is this ability targeted like the DW bouncing dagger ability or does it get thrown forwards like Velidreth proc? If its a main spammable then the scythe morph should deal  or  the damage as the DoT version. if you debuff your opponents regen by  the cyro players will actively hunt you down IRL. Its a cool idea and buffing allies by  on all stats is probably also too high. How about it just buffs your highest regen stay by  instead of the others? And debuffs your opponents highest one not all three. Dagger prep  why does a dagger snare enemies? Maybe if it was some form of an actual trap Create a bladed trap inside an area. I like this one the most so far. how does Animate weapons morph work with dual wielding? Does it give you  blades? Also this doesnt seem very Bardlike but the empower does. why does a Bard have glaives as a morph?This looks to be a low cost ulti seems okay.Thoughts the concoction and the trap could be bardlike but the rest of it seems to be focussed on some sort of rogueblademaster identity? Looks very much like it attempts to copy a Nightblade which means that either Nightblades will be stronger than this and no one would play it or vice versa. At a brief glance the other  skill trees seem much more Bardlike so I would look at refocussing this one to be less dagger and shiv oriented and more traps overall.

Used to run with a badass DK healer that did all the trials.  magplar. Dont play it but I know how effective they are in numerous aspects.  controversial but im a huge fan of stamina Templar. They take a ton of gear to be end game feasible but I can pull k which is higher than an average raider. They have a class cleansemajor mending repentance for sustainheals rune for defense and a really strong class spammable.

11414929,0,t1_dfprsqp,sigh I just wish it was anything like GW.  Its too much of an easygoing theme park adventure too many things are handheld.  I really miss GW where you had to manage resources had to tailor your build to the zone you were in to your group.  Just how many different builds there were group builds solo builds dungeon duo builds the evolving PvP meta from Heroes Ascent to man Random Arenas.  That was sort of the downfall of the game though too many skills to manage and balance.  GW does do player convenience exceptionally well.  Account unlocked armor and weapon skins account wide deep crafting storage easy skill swapping interesting but not searingpaininmyasshole crafting unless you count Legendaries.  Crafting material nodes that cant be stolen no mobtapping and thus no quest mob spawncampingcompetition these two alone made it so that other players are not a detriment to your experience.

The CP you get are kind of like skill points. You can put CP in any passive and these passives increase things like Magicka Recovery singletarget damage etc. Also each CP you spend increases one of your three stats depending on the type by a tiny amount which stacks up over time.CP is universal so if you make a new character you can spend the CP right from level  and all the passives will work. However they cant wear CPlevel gear until they reach level  at which point they are instantly boosted to your accounts CP level.

11526066,0,t3_64ijef,Ill just finish up this thread by clarifying that class skills weapon skills and armor skill lines are based on experience gained so killing monsters and turning in quests. The crafting lines are inspiration based. So you can only level those at crafting stations and by completing the daily crafting writs. The guild lines I think are considered inspiration too but those are leveled through collections achievements and quest lines for each. The pvp lines are leveled in cyrodiil through quests and killing each other. ,elderscrollsonline,dg2hc9l,2,t5_2tqi0

11531421,0,t3_64laly,Light armor is for magicka DPShealers medium armor is for stamina DPS and heavy armor is for tanks. Dragonknight damagedealers either go allmagicka and wear light armor or allstamina and wear medium armor. This goes for PVE PVP is a different beast.Unfortunately the twohanded skill line has no place in endgame PVE at the moment regardless of what your role is or what armor youre wearing. Its simply too underwhelming in terms of both singletarget and AOE damage. Theres nothing it offers for PVE that other skill lines wont do better. Its not that hard to find guilds that will be happy to do endgame content with you even if youre not built to the meta. The problem is that twohanded warriors arent just out of the meta theyre genuinely nonviable for endgame PVE unless youre some kind of savant. Its a shame the skill line really needs to be redesigned. On the other hand a heavyarmor stamina Dragonknight with a battleaxe is incredibly powerful in PVP. ,elderscrollsonline,dg337bt,1,t5_2tqi0

11558397,0,t1_dg63ayk,I guess I can fill in some details on that before I go to lunch. Ideally there would be at most  melee DPS if there are less a ranged can move up to one of those positions and be fine. More than  and things get crowded. With one tank during the stomp phase the tank should range taunt the mages and kite them onto the boss running back to the group and grabbing any chainspinners returning prior to the end of that phase. Its a short time span so it can be a do your best  as long as the tank has the mage taunts the group wont take the damage anyway. With two tanks if the off tank is unable to swap over and do DPS then they can gather the mobs into the group while the main tank holds the boss and buffs the group with igneous shields circle of protection etc. When the boss goes into the teepee pyramid whatever you want to call the formation that signals the boulder phase the dps should all spread out rotating around the boss and block cast. When it is over return to the single line of  stacks melee on tank range behind them spaced to where they spread around the radius keeping the same distance then healers in back dropping combat prayer and doing healer things. The most important thing is for everyone to recognize the boss phases and act accordingly. Also if chainspinners drop too many AOEs on the group have a sorc drop a negate to clear them. If its just one dont worry about it and have them using their DPS ulti. If your group just cant stay alive in the pound phase then a nova will help. But the more DPS done to the boss the shorter the fight the fewer adds.There are some other strategies we tried out along the way such as a two group one behind one in front setup if you read anything about that I wouldnt bother with it it spreads out the chain spinners and drops the DPS on the boss too much. If at all possible have that off tank doing DPS during this and let the main tank handle it all. Depending on their experience it may take a while to get it down. But after watching a really good team run on stream for a few hours Monday I experimented quite a bit that night and the tank doesnt have to be too tanky at all for the first  fights there. Dropping hardened armor and talons to double bar guard and dropping bubbles facing the wrong way on stoney anyway for circle of protection seemed to be very effective.,elderscrollsonline,dg65cvo,3,t5_2tqi0

11637236,0,t3_660hai,gt Its about actual elitism towards new players.Well this issue goes in both directions.Are there elitist jerks who will kick people out of groups simply because they are not using the right weapon even though they are performing adequately? Of course there are.BUT there are also plenty of new players who thinks they are playing a sandbox game without other players and insist and even insult you if you tell them on playing their way even though it might be counterproductive to the performance of the group especially in vet dungeons Insisting in playing in firstperson view while always ending up in red zones because they cant see their surroundings. Insisting on using a mix amp match set of weaponsarmorattributes but asking people for comments on their build and then complaining when people are telling them that they should focus on either Stamina or Magicka but not both.Elitism can also be when someone persist in doing it his own way thinking that everybody elses comments and experience are worthless. When you play an MMO you have to accept that you play with other people and your actions can also affect them. Sometimes what is perceived as elitism is simply a desire by some to ensure that the whole group perform as well as it can considering its a synergy between  players.,elderscrollsonline,dgf3dtb,2,t5_2tqi0

11656495,0,t1_dggyouh,No PW is essentially you can not progress or even participate with out paying or you can progress but at a fraction of the speed. This is what you see in all PW MMOs and Mobile games. A lot of these MMOs have a cap on crafting through a point system and the only way to craft more is to buy items that allow you to get more points. And crafting gear in this instance is usually BiS. The other popular way to PW an MMO is making gear progression though upgradable gear IE Upgrade items goes into gear and gives it . Usually has RNG attached by having a chance to fail chance to fail gets exponentially higher as gear gets better. Only way to get better chances it to buy items that reduces RNG or bypasses it all together. and once you hit a cap you have to pay to bypass very strong RNG.ESO will allow players to do all the same activities and create builds in whatever fashion the player wants as it always has been. They are simply adding a class that is potentially OP still in testing on PTS tons of MMOs add classes and they are more often then not OP. Just because the class is gated through the expansion which is paid content doesnt mean it is PW. It simply means you have to buy the expansion to get access to the new class. It will be balanced in the future.,elderscrollsonline,dgha0zz,1,t5_2tqi0

Was  body  swords front bar kagrenacs hope and  body  sword  shield back bar seducers using one piece of a monster helm shoulder works too of grothdarr or kena and  piece willpower on the jewellery you can use a couple healthy if youre low on money.

Also  or  heavy is really good unless you want to run a burst setup as otherwise you will probably melt.For dropped sets spinners and rattlecage are both nice and work well on templar. You would run these as a  and use a monster set to your liking.Most of the time templars run dual wield on front bar because of the extra slot it gives to get  and the fact you dont lose out on much damage. Running a destro back bar to use destro ulti would be good if you want to run a full offensive setup.Spec  into magicka and use tristat food so your stamina pool is decent.What abilities you run can be up to you though running meteor and inner light is good for dps.Normally i use radiant sweeps vampires banereflective light purifying lighttoppling charge inner light meteor front barChanneled focus extended ritual dark flareflex spot harness magicka breath of life ulti flexFor the back bar ulti you can run vampire ulti hsh ulti or rememberance if you are after group healsHarness magicka or dark flare could be switched for mist form if you want to vX or want more defensiveness in open world pvp,elderscrollsonline,dgjrdum,1,t5_2tqi0

11690285,0,t3_66srwc,A Bosmer Archer would be best suited to a Nightblade which focuses on Stamina abilities. A Breton Battlemage would be best suited to a Templar or Dragonknight If you envisage fire to be used which focuses on Magicka. An Imperial Templar would be best suited to a Templar obvs which could either be a Tank or Stamina DPS. Regarding viability literally anything would be fine for casual group or solo content. However if you wanted to do challenging stuff then youd have to change things up a bit. For example a Bosmer Archer would have to use a Bow as backbar for area of effect and damage over time effects and then use Duel Wield for main damaging abilities.  From looking at your replies in this threadIve never played any previous ES games but in ESO group play theres basically three defined roles tank healer or damage dealer although once you know the class and are competent enough these can overlap somewhat. I say Magicka and Stamina because theyre what  most healing and damaging abilities scale off. The way ESO works is that X abilitys strength scales off either Magicka and Spell Damage or Stamina and Weapon Damage. So if you wanted to hit an enemy with a Bow attack which would be physical damage it would scale off Stamina and Weapon Damage. But if you wanted to use a Destruction staff attack that would be magic FlameInferno FrostIce or Lightning damage it would scale off Magicka and Spell Damage. The same principle applies to class abilities and a good rule of thumb is that if it require Magicka or Stamina then the damage scales of that and its respective damage. As a result damage dealers and healers try to stack eitheror in order to maximise the efficiency of their abilities. e.g. Theres little point in a Magicka damage dealer increasing their Stamina and Weapon damage in PvE PvP is slightly different as Stamina is important for them to dodge block etc as theyll be losing out of Magicka and Spell Damage which would increase their damage. However when you begin playing nearly? all class abilities require Magicka. This is because you tend to run around a lot block and dodge and so your Stamina usage is high even without using abilities. Once you get XP and level these abilities up to Rank  then theres the option for you to improvechange them normally either to Magicka or Stamina. e.g. Veiled Strike in the Nightblades class Shadow line begins as Magicka but can be morphed to Surprise Attack Stamina or Concealed Weapon Magicka.  Let me know if you have any questions or need more explanation. ,elderscrollsonline,dgl417q,3,t5_2tqi0

For veteran rank two dungeons The second story ones I would wait till you get at least  CP especially City of Ash . This dungeon is not very friendly for low CP level players.

11787137,0,t1_dgvz9ru, Yup! Swallow Soul is really nice because its fairly high damage low cost and it also heals you for a lot so its really nice when youre leveling. Race is fairly crucial. The  max magicka you get from DunmerAltmerBreton equates to around  extra damage and the  extra fire damage from Dunmer is a variable increase since the  of my damage that is fire isnt always the same but in vMA its probably a  DPS increase.K would definitely be possible on Altmer and perhaps on Breton but I dont think itd be possible on something like Orc or Nord.,elderscrollsonline,dgw40ko,2,t5_2tqi0

It wouldnt give as much damage as the others but it makes up for that with the  piece bonus.EDIT Only downside of Black Rose is it is incredibly expensive.
