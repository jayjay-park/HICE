But time and again some of my devices would lose connection to it and wont even connect unless I restarted the device or router. And sometimes even if all devices show it is connected to router nothing works like webpage opening or anything.Is this because the router is a cheap one and not able to handle so many devices ?? Or is it because it is in a confined space with little ventilation and I should put it somewhere with a more air flow ? May be router is getting hot not checked yet.,earnhoney,d9wagdz,1,t5_37tsq

My guess another of Joes Slugs who thought they could make a fortune and learned the hard way. Q is endless whining about low earnings on every appservice  same thing every year. And by the way EH really has no competition on the desktop. So expect earnings to drop across the board even during prime season.
