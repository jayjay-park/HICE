8602748,0,t3_4xnk9m,I got one of him coming out of Leathemstown. The RCV drowns out the other bikes! Bit of a shaky bad quality phone video too! ,MotoIRELAND,d6gxrg9,2,t5_3fs5d
8606071,0,t1_d6hci7z,It is a CB. But a CBF Hornet unfortunately. Similar situation about manuals for it too. Though at least for the engine a lot of the CBRRR manual covers it. ,MotoIRELAND,d6hcqs5,1,t5_3fs5d

9363840,0,t1_d92lfdl,You could probably sort it out with some good aftermarket suspension. Most of them now will need that upgrade anyhows due to age. In its favour its pretty light and does the job as a roadster. Its very thirsty though and with a fairly small tank touring is a stop and go affair. The one i owned came with a nice billet ABM top yoke converion with handlebars and was pretty comfy to ride but I cant speak of the standard clipon position as I havent tried it.Cam chain tensioners are notoriously a weak point in what was otherwise a very stong engine. Make sure the originals have been modified or replaced. Not terribly expensive to get if it hasnt.Apparently they have a knack for highsiding you if the pace gets too hot but thankfully I didnt experience that particular trait. Like I said as a laid back roadster that looks sporty it does the job ok. ,MotoIRELAND,d92xmen,2,t5_3fs5d
