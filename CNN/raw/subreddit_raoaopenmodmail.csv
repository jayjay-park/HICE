9245,0,t1_cefhfoe,I would think this is just a misinterpretation on your part. In this instance it would be something you should go and check out watch the dynamics for a few days and then you would have a fully formed idea on what the sub is about vs. an impression.I personally would not like this to be an open group for that exact reason. Trolls. Having a heavy mod base even in RAOA does not prevent or detour trolls. Not one person there deserves to have a troll entering there. Several people like me are triggered by such things and that wouldnt be fair or ideal either.,raoaopenmodmail,cefhl07,4,t5_2y2dg

576384,0,t3_20qch6,I like it hidden. If you look at old Daily Threads not many comments beyond the top  comments get anything other than what you might call background upvotes. I like it. I think it forces you to read comments and decide if you should upvote it. I think it would make more worthy comments upvoted more. I do think it might lead to people upvoting users theyre friends with more but I think we would need to keep this for a while to find out. ,raoaopenmodmail,cg5sfc0,16,t5_2y2dg
576842,0,t1_cg5u6gf,All of mine are on NEW too.  I actually dont know how users dont miss things when its not on NEW but Ive learned everyone has their preferences.  It would make me sad though if I wasnt noticed because I didnt get enough upvotes to be hot somewhere.  I never realized that was happening.  Luckily NEW isnt going anywhere or Id die.,raoaopenmodmail,cg5uarg,3,t5_2y2dg

700906,0,t1_cgjwel0,gt Part of the daily thread is chat so I suppose people talking about it and me ignoring it like I would in a chat room works fine for me. Thats basically how I operate in the Daily as well. ,raoaopenmodmail,cgjy1oz,5,t5_2y2dg

2073349,0,t1_cl3aijb,Cheezits are my favorite cracker type snack but I have to keep my portions in check or I get sick of them for a while. My favorite way to eat them is in minestrone soup. But I only put a few in at a time so they dont get soggy they have to still crunch. Mmmm. Now Im hungry. Damnit James.,raoaopenmodmail,cl3d9go,3,t5_2y2dg

2714128,0,t3_2r541l,Hello cwf!We already have the user directory to share screen names for skype snapchat and also steam. This can be found on the main sub sidebar gt User Tools gt SnapchatSteamSkype directory. Adding it to the flairs would just add clutter and as we are not a sub that focuses on steam it would be best to keep the flairs for amazon wishlists only.Feel free to join our steam group GoRAoA to find other gamers from our sub!,raoaopenmodmail,cncl3c3,1,t5_2y2dg
