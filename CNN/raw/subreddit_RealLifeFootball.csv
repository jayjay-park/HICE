He started perfoming well once he was moved to the left wing though so he might not be what you guys need if youre looking for a striker. Dont know how reliable these rumours linking him to you guys are but Corinthians really want to get rid of him and he already made it clear that he wants to move to Europe so it might happen.Damio was in decent form at the start of the year and it was looking like he was over his shitty form from his Santos days but once the Brasileiro started he became shit again. He offers no mobility and has been incredibly wasteful missing really easy chances. Also cant hold onto the ball and his only strength is probably being a decent aerial threat. And this deal is looking possible his agent said that Damio is going to play in Europe this season and that Sporting are already close to signing him but you shouldnt really expect much tbh.,RealLifeFootball,cz7nrxd,1,t5_38iu7

Whereas for right back nobody has been consistently solid so Its not that unusual for people like him to get it wrong. Ivanovic may well have been worse than Blind but thats irrelevant given theyre fighting for different positions. Ivanovic definitely hasnt been as far away from the leagues better RBs as Blind from the best CBs...      Its also pretty comical that Blind is you definition of a really solid season shows how far your standards have fallen under Van Gaal.
