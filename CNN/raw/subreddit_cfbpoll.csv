Good win against cupcake. | Auburn | Tough team they faced. Team looks really good. | Ole Miss | Team impressed me but they played a cupcake.

Well coached. | LSU | Held opposition to  points. | BYU | Really impressive win. Lost that QB but Ill give the new guy a chance before dropping them out. | Oklahoma | Offense looking like it might be better this year. | Missouri | Meh. | Virginia Tech | Lost to a really good team. | Arizona State | See above reasoning. | Tennessee | Unproven potential to move way up. | Utah | Looked good against Mich. | Texas | As uTheFriendlyThalmor so elegantly put it Jesus fucking Christ bitch fuck shit ass balls.Edit Decided to bold the  teams I thought would be in the playoffs cause why not?
