3052735,0,t3_2v4mid,First off you gotta play Galaxy  amp  regardless of that theyre amazing games.     Secondly Id say get StarFox only if you really want to replay it for those sweet sweet memories?. What I can say is that Ive never played SF when I was younger so never got any nostalgia going on  when I played it for the first time a couple years ago I just disliked it for how short it is and how cumbersome the controls felt to me. So at least in my perspective StarFox doesnt feel like a game that has aged well.    That said Ive never played Mario  when I was younger either so zero nostalgia as well. I tried it a few months ago for the first time and had a blast with it even after having played a lot of the other modern Mario games  played that one from beginning to end in a few days. The camera sometimes feels weird the graphics are a bunch of simple polygons... but the game is still charming with a great soundtrack and fun gameplay.    Hope this helps you.,Club_Nintendo,coeeww1,3,t5_30tvk

3132267,0,t3_2w0en7,StarFox  D is the best version of StarFox  you can play it has upgraded graphics great gyroscopic controls and its easy to play on the go. Meanwhile Donkey Kong CR D is not optimal on the DS. While the game is still great the graphics take a hit being ported to the DSs small screen compared to the game on the Wii. The game can feel very cramped on the DSs buttons even on an XL. Besides the most important factor is that Donkey Kong CR can get really hard and would only get harder to play on a small screen with cramped little buttons playing it with a wiimote or a nunchuk is just a lot better honestly. Anyway StarFox  D is harder to find while the better version of DKCR is on the Wii dont bother playing it on the DS.,Club_Nintendo,comnoie,0,t5_30tvk

Its a cool branch from the Mario series taking you into a different turnbased playstyle thats Mario themed.  Its certainly got some length too it too and the characters are entertaining.  Its one of my favorite games from the N along with Legend of Zelda OoT and MM.  Id certainly recommend it.  And back to the point of super high quality yes.  And it was before the time of patches so the game was really refined.

3535974,0,t1_cpv5d9j,I disagree. Even as its own title Sticker Stars central mechanics are inherently broken as the three main elements of the title exploration sticker collection and battling are all opposed to each other. The game wants you to collect stickers. However it also wants you to battle and when you battle you lose stickers. As such it incentivizes you to avoid battles and simply explore the level. However the more you explore the more likely you are to end up in a battle. Moreover the game has a literal coin incentive for beating a level quickly. As such it incentivizes you twiceover to avoid exploration. In the end this means the best way to play the game as in the way that has the greatest reward and smallest loss is to hoard stickers avoid battles and run to the end of the level as fast as possible praying you stumble across the few key stickers that are necesary to progress.Add this to the fact that the game lacks the engaging characters and story elements of the first three titles and the whole thing is an absolute mess.,Club_Nintendo,cpvbobo,1,t5_30tvk

3552436,0,t3_30zefz,Oh I have a fake true story to tell!Club Nintendo was my life. Ever since I was a little child I would purchase brand new Nintendo items just for the coins. And the best part of it would be when I would come back to school to find out that I had postplay surveys to fill. Awesome! But then one day in January of this year the bad news came. They were going to take down my childhood way of entertainment! I contacted Nintendo and told them that I would give a lot if money but they said no. I guess it is true that Nintendo hates money. So now my only way of keeping this service alive is to make a complete replica of the website. Ive already contacted a website building team and weve decided that its URL will be  and will be up soon enough. I hope a few people at least will keep enjoying Club Nintendo with this new Club Nintendo copy because I sure will. But before I am unable to I would like to fill out one last Club Nintendo survey which is why I am asking here for help. Thank you very much for reading and have a nice day because tomorrow you and I will enter a new phase of our lives a phase without Club Nintendo surveys.,Club_Nintendo,cpx794f,1,t5_30tvk

3966448,0,t1_cr8c59s,Materials  thick posterboardish paper something like an old cereal box would be perfect  gluebrush to apply  printer with color ink and printer paper  rulerstraight edge  scissors  varnishbrush to apply  foam brush works best this part is optional but I definitely recommend it  sharpie for touchups   ampnbspDirections  Cut your posterboardish material into  rectangle that is   x   and  rectangle that is   x .  ampnbspUsing your ruler make a mark   on the brown sideblank side depending on what you used of all  sides of both rectangles.  ampnbspUse the ruler to make a crease on all  sides of both rectangles by lining up with the   marks that you made.  If you dont care about marks being seen use a pen or a pencil and press hard to make the crease.  If you dont want marks use something like a paper clip or possibly your scissors if youre careful.  I used the back side of an Xacto blade.  Again make sure you are doing this on the blank side of your posterboard  this is going to be the inside of your box.  ampnbspYou should end up with  squares on the corners of both rectangles.  Cut  side of each square to make flaps that you can fold in.  ampnbspFold along your creases and glue the flaps to the wall next to it making a box shape.  ampnbspPrint this image out and trim the sides so you have about a  white border.  ampnbspMix your glue with some water about  part glue to  parts water and brush a thin layer onto the top of the larger box.  Id precrease your paper so its easier to line up.  Put the paper face down and then put your lid on top of that.  ampnbspWith the lid upsidedown press on the inside of the lid so its smooth on top.  ampnbspApply a thin layer of the glue mixture to one side of the lid and press the lid to the paper.  You basically do this on all sides making sure to tuck in the corners before you glue them down.  ampnbspYoull end up with  white paper that you need to tuck back and glue to the inside of the box.  Again use the glue mixture so its not too thick.  ampnbspIf some on the white is showing on the sides just use a Sharpie to cover it up.  ampnbspIf you used a cereal box that has print on the bottom part of the box youll want to cover that too.  Do the same thing with a solid color of your choice or really whatever you want to use to the bottom puzzle box.  ampnbspApply a couple coats of varnish over the paper.  The ink on the paper will try to resist the varnish but if you constantly go over the area then eventually it will get tacky enough to stick  you can apply a second smoother coat after this.  Do the varnish one panel at a time  dont try to do the entire lid at once.  ampnbspAllow it to dry and then youre done!  ampnbspampnbspI know some of it can be kind of hard to visualize.  Ill try to do a bettereasier guide to follow with pictures over the weekend if you want.,Club_Nintendo,cr8eqei,6,t5_30tvk
