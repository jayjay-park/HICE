In terms of visualization Ill obviously be able to draw out maps that are intentionally vague or if anyone is having a hard time imagining an area Im describing. Because so much of Dungeon World is made up on the fly Itd be impossible for me to have everything planned out in a way that youd have prebuilt map.

1608292,0,t1_cjhvq8g,Its a generational Game for the most part where you tend to end up playing as multiple characters of the same family throughout the years of Arthurs reign and before. The AngloSaxons are a constant menace to fight against as well. Generally there should be lots of opportunities for fighting political maneuvering and other fun stuff.The wikipedia article describes it quite wellgt Adventures are often political military or spiritual in nature rather than dungeon crawls and are often presented as taking place congruently with events from Arthurian legend. An important part of the game is the time between adventures during which player characters manage their estates get married age and have children. Typically the characters will have one adventure per year and campaigns often carry over across generations with players retiring their character and taking the role of that characters heir. This is quite different from most roleplaying games where one set of characters is played fairly intensively and there is typically little consideration made of what happens to their family or descendants.,lfg,cjhw5c4,1,t5_2rcvr

2451710,0,t3_2nju80,The Gardeners or TendersThe Gardeners come in a great variety of subspecies appropriate to the biome they originated from  each variation has been uniquely crafted to suit their environment.  In general however they are small nimble scaley creatures with long limbs that end in hook shaped claws more adapted for climbing but suitable for combat if necessary.  They have narrow heads with a scaled snout and eagle sharp vision.  Coloration varies greatly between subspecies but tend to favor muted colors appropriate to their environment with bright colorful markings at the tips of some of their scales.  More and less flamboyant variations are possible within each subspecies. The creator built the Gardeners to tend the wild spaces of his creation a balance against the natural entropy of the universe to stray from his ideal.  Before being gifted the Gardeners were tasked with culling the dead and dying flora of the realm cultivating new growth when necessary and attempting to maintain grand plan for nature as appropriate in their part of the world.The Gardeners have been somewhat twisted since the gift.  While they still retain their innate drive to create beauty order and balance theyve lost the guiding force that defines the details of these qualities.  While some Gardeners manage to create true examples of artistry and wonder quite often this dichotomy tends to drive members of the race to great acts of perversion in the name of some or all of these ideals.  As the perception of beauty can vary wildly with the beholder so to can the whims of a Gardener.  That said they all tend to have an extreme sense of order just one that doesnt necessarily align itself with external sensibilities. Gardeners have a tendency to squabble easily amongst themselves for the reasons above but oftentimes larger societies of likeminded Gardeners can band together and they can be a singularly driven force when united in a cause. Strangely one common factor among these communities tends to be a channel for the fierce competitiveness over the definition and popularity of beauty.  Trends in fashion politics and art flash by at great speeds in Gardener societies and the celebration of uniqueness and creativity is tempered by the sometimes vicious struggle for power leadership and voice within the community.A note on Gardener subspeciesWhile initially localized within their biome Gardener subspecies have spread far and wide driven by a tendency to branch out from the established ideals of other Gardener communities.  As such nearly any Gardener subspecies can be found in any biome and often times in the company of subspecies other than their own.  Gardeners care less about the inherent distinction between subraces than the current aesthetic trends they are interested in. Forest Gardeners tend to be taller but still small and built for climbing trees.  Tropical forest Gardeners tend toward brighter colors and are often extremely vibrant and multihued. Alone among the Gardeners they can somewhat mute but not change the colors of their scales at will.  Temperate forest Gardeners have delicate membranes under their arms and can glide short distances if unencumbered.  Boreal forest Gardeners have fur instead of scales and larger feet for walking in snow. Desert Gardeners are relatively rare and are strong jumpers.  Their claws are better suited for climbing rocks than trees.  They tend to be more nocturnal have excellent hearing and can survive on very little water. Aquatic Gardeners have webbed feet and hands as well as vestigial claws unsuited for climbing.  While they cannot breathe underwater they can hold their breath for a very long time.  Ocean Gardeners can survive on saltwater although they find it distasteful and are powerful swimmers.  Swamp Gardeners are decent climbers and swimmers and tend to be irritable in arid environments.  They tend strongly towards having only muted colors in scales. Grassland Gardeners do not climb and have only vestigial claws.  They are however powerful runners and the most muscular of the subspecies.Anyway you get the idea.About me  I havent played E although Id love to.  I DM and love worldbuilding  Ive played a bit with the Microscope system although you really have to have a group that is committed and not actively working against each other for that Ive found.This is a project Id totally be interested in although Im not sure my schedule would allow for it  I work until  CST daily.  Anyway I hope you enjoyed the Gardeners  I had a lot of fun writing them and imagining them.,lfg,cmeqges,2,t5_2rcvr

Ive only played one oneshot but Ive seen my fair share of youtube content for DampD so I have a pretty good idea of how to play the game. Im not really familiar with Faerun but Im flexible as to fit the lore.My idea for a character would be a tiefling rogue that tries to use subterfuge and stealth to cause chaos to get coin and cause damage to enemy ranks. Ive loved stealth games for a long time and want to try it out in RPG format!Ive also got an idea for a very angry dwarven monk that went into the cloister to control his temper.

I am currently running an Only War Campaign which if you are not familiar is an RPG set in the Grim Dark future of Warhammer k where you play an Imperial Guardsman or some affliated agency.

You will find that it is most often an immersive Roleplay  and detailed large combat events . We use minis that I build and paint custom miniatures for each of the players based on the character description that they develope. All that aside....

Discord allows us to check the chat rooms from our computers tablets and mobile phones.  This allows us to bring our PBP games with us on the go whereas forum based mediums are usually hard to reach through phonestablets.  We have a number of DMs running games on our server at the moment.  Each channelone game that only the DM and players of that game can type in however everyone else in the server is able to follow along with their favorite games as they can read the channels posts only.    For the most part you just type out what your character would do and the DM describes the worldconsequences.  It works out well but sometimes scheduling can be rough.  But I impose a  hour post limit and it keeps the game going.  Really you have to go in with a mindset that it will be a very casual game that can run for a very long time.,lfg,d05frtg,1,t5_2rcvr

7419648,0,t1_d2lk2lx,Ill be honest with ya man most of us in the guild never heard of that system before haha. I think its PirateSwashbuckling themed? Im pretty sure everyone applying to that game is going to be a newbie so dont worry about it.Secondly to apply to the game you need to first apply to Steelbourne. You do that by going to the site then click on the Apply button at the top right. Its fairly quick and painless. Just some rules to read standard conduct stuff etc. Its partially there to inform but also to weed out the people that arent serious and would be likely to flake out fairly easily.Once you get accepted as a member of Steelbourne all you do from there is post in the sign up thread for the game denoting your interest in joining.,lfg,d2lkdpj,2,t5_2rcvr

7740733,0,t1_d3m0j2z,Used to live in Rocky River where I met a bunch of people.  I have been out of the scene for about  years now.  Just run games for friends and family now every so often.  I am not sure who still runs games but I will tell you where I had luck.Avoid Warzone like the plague.  I tried playing there a few times and every single time was miserable.  The games were just a bunch of adult kids talking about their great DampD adventures and trying to oneup each other.  Constantly minmaxing their characters with no real roleplaying.  Cheating and fudging dice roles were the norm. Different friends asked me to come and play.  It seems to bring the worse out in people including my friends.  I completely understand about the OCD as well.  Not sure how they stay in business.There is actually a new place that I know some people say they were trying to start a game at in Brunswick.  Not sure how active but you might want to call.  Mr. Ds I think it is called.  Next to Big Lots maybe?  Heard it is mostly Magic and Pokemon so maybe DampD just never picked up.There is Ground Zero in Strongsville.  Used to have  nights of nightly oneshot pickup games.  Usually pretty chill but kind of a younger high school crowd when I played.   I used to be a fillin DM when they needed help.Gamers Haven in Parma Heightrs is more miniature games when I was playing but they did have DampD groups maybe twice a month.Underhills Games in Cuyahoga Falls was my favorite.  They had  weekday games and a few on the weekend.  I found a good group Tuesday nights and would make the  minute drive because it was completely worth it.  I never had much luck at Recess.  They were constantly moving while at the mall and things never seemed to get going.  I did watch and help some younger kids when my GF was shopping several times.,lfg,d3m2d03,1,t5_2rcvr

My timezone is GMT and I have several exams throughout the next four weeks. I love watching Critical Role and if youve watched it I think Id want to emulate that style of gameplay. i.e. They focus on story which is not to say that combat isnt a big part of it and each have thorough backstories.Anyway Im fairly new to DMing and I dont really know as of yet where we could play.

Dantes only friend has been a whisper inside his head and the offer of great power. He has created a pact with the demon that he believes put him on this earthbecause he never met his family so he believes that demon put him in the world to ensure the death of an angel that banished the demon. Dantes motivation is to continue to gain power so society will notice him for being a powerful adventurer and loved not a hated demon spawn.

8633526,0,t3_4y28xs,Hey I know I missed the cut off but I would like to express interest in what you have going here.I have been playing various different RPGS over the last  years both of the video and pen amp paper variety.  Most of my experience is with DND . and e.  I currently DM an Adventurers League game and I have been in a few games in the intervening time set in both homebrew and established settings.  I am very comfortable with most classes or roles although I dont particularly care for pure healers.  Most of my games were done via Roll with only my AL game being in person.  I have never really had much success with a pure PBP game but one of the campaigns that I played in had a very lively downtime RP thread in between our biweekly sessions.I hope all goes well with your endeavor but if you need a back up I would love to be considered.,lfg,d6ksqin,1,t5_2rcvr

9242405,0,t1_d8nieee,Hey! That is a very interesting take. I believe the biggest thing I would like to take from tinder is the accessibility. It is so easy to get started and jump right in.The ideas that we have for this without getting too far into it are based around a gamer score and a tribunal system. This is not unlike League of Legends but would be much more active in actual actions taken. This is a community that I want people to be proud of and I believe if we can accomplish that we will have a good base of people genuinely concerned about the environment and willing to help keep things clean. This is what you see with moderators in Twitch chat. This all done with checks and balances. It will be important to monitor activity of people with this sort of power over the app and let the data put up any red flags or outliers. ,lfg,d8njirh,1,t5_2rcvr

9719734,0,t3_5e9ql9,hello! name DavidAge Skypediscord i have both but not much experience with discord tho.willing to use eithercompletely alright with microphone use.in rpgs i value both the story and smoothness of play and interactions with the world where it feels like your character is getting somewhere and i have to admit i do quite like the occasional combat to stir things upi tend to start with a core idea sometimes based completely in RP sometimes in rolled stats or sometimes just an archetype i want to try out and go from there. altho it can sometimes go a bit overboard with character building once i get into it.ive played mostly pathfinder altho my last game is about a year ago but a good few sessions under my belt and have tried my hand at DMing at one point but it got a little out of hand. it was as a sort of filler session with a group i played with but due to ilness and work we couldnt play much longer even after someone else began DMinga DM in my opinion should be able to string things along and give the players a push in the right direction. aswell as keep a steady pace in the game. not having to look up basic rules for the umpteenth time and sometimes just making a decision on a rule when it come upas long as it doesnt turn into fanfiction level erotica im good.mondaythursday from  to  fridays  to indefinite saturdays  to indefinite. sundays  to yes i am comfordable with improv and have played a couple of games like that.not really except i hope that we can keep eachother updated if were gonna miss a session for whatever reason family matters bad luck holidays etc.,lfg,dab62tk,1,t5_2rcvr

I now listen to AdventureZone and all of Dungeon Delve podcasts and find myself watching live DampD games on Twitch during my lunch breaks. Im an early s married father lawyer criminal law. Ive always been a big fantasy fan but I must be experiencing some geeky renaissance at this point in my life. Im not gonna overthink it. But I need to start actually playing. I picked up the ed Starter Set and Player Handbook and I think Im ready to actually play IRL understanding that there will be a learning curve for a while. Alexandria  Falls Church area.  Biweekly.  Ready to jump in on a game asap. ,lfg,ddk85ec,1,t5_2rcvr

10740041,0,t3_5tn8bq,Please reference the summary section for a shorter answer.My name is Pavel Im a rd level human monk trained in the way of the Air Force the power that influences all life. This force allows me to jump using effortless step and step of the wind ft high and use force push fist of unbroken air. Im . I live in MST but starting at am for me isnt a big deal. Ive DMing and playing e for about a year but Im a huge fan of the game I just cant get enough! Ive poured through the book many times and like to think I have a grasp on the rules fairly well. I DM home brew games with complete novices who have never read the handbook so basically my word is law when I DM something I really dislike as a DM  I like feedback. I posted here explaining how erratic my schedule was and Sunday is basically my only day off from class and work so Sundays are perfect for me.Currently my favorite character is Pavel. That being said I havent played many characters. I wouldnt mind rolling a new one to fit into the character roles. For pavel my favorite magic item would be something to finally give him a lightsaberesqe weapon. Your split seems pretty on point. The only thing is disagree with is the looting. Especially as a dm I think its the most boring part of the game. Id agree with maybe  to  looting and more on the role playing and action.My favorite animals are obviously turtles. I like turtles. I dont have a Skype or discord but Ill get one asap. I have roll  but I have never used it. Also I am not quite sure how US dollars translate to pounds s that might be an issue as well. I dont enjoy evil campaigns to much. I also prefer the combat to be more detailed with bosses who dont just sit there and attack but rather spring traps feign retreat and even pick us up.In summaryMy namealias Pavel.Age Time zone MSTExperience  year of mixed DMing and playing mostly DMFavorite class and race My jedi monk Pavel human. But I love all aspects of the game and will gladly roll new characters for the sake of fluidity and mechanics.Sundays theyre perfect. One question though. How long are the sessions?Ideal magic item a lightsaberesqe quarterstaff for PavelSplit similar to yours but with less looting more action and rp.Skype and discord never used them but will gladly make one asap if youre interested.Contributions Id gladly contribute. The only problem is I dont quite know how to translate pounds to US dollars.Playtime weekly is perfect as long as the story is intriguing I have no doubt it will be. As I said I cant get enough of the game. Animal I like turtlesGameplay I link to avoid evil scenarios. I am not inherently evil and have a hard time playing any chaotic evil characters. I like to avoid sacrifices and all that demonic stuff but will try to do my best for the sake of the group. I also hate games that split the group into segments. This is a group game and there is no I in group.Id love to play with you guys! You seem like a cool guy. I love this game and want to see how other players do it rather than just me and my DM. Edit I just created a discord account. My username is cornu I think. I figured most players here used it plus Ill use it for gaming so why not.,lfg,ddnr5t3,1,t5_2rcvr

I am newer to DnD but have played GURPS. Only experience I have had with DnD is looking through the rulebook when the GM from the GURPS campaign thought they wanted to use DnD. I am in CST so timing should almost never be an issue.Edit added timezone,lfg,dfwe7n8,1,t5_2rcvr

11586270,0,t3_6599bb, I run a West Marches style game where we have about  or so active players right now and Im looking to boost that by potentially  or . I run two to three sessions a week and we have several fun players. This campaign style means that youll not be playing with the same group on a regular schedule youll be mixing it up with the pool of players and going on only the adventures you choose to do.Im secretly looking for a few evil characters as well if youre interested. If not totally cool.This campaign style isnt for everyone as its not a straightforward DM reads you a story style campaign. Creative and ambitious players will thrive here as its very collaborative between players and DM shaping the world as we go. I do a lot of voices and RP. Feel free to jump in by clicking the discord link  character creation info can be found on the server after you join and Im dorkass around often to answer questions.,lfg,dg9b7f3,1,t5_2rcvr
