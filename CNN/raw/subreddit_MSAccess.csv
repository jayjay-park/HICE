If youre just interacting directly with the table you cant really do much of anything automatically whether its logging changes or anything else. I guess you could create an invisible form which monitors changes on a timer but if youre going to do that you might as well create a form to enter data.My suggestion would be to start doing some reading about Access design. See if you can add some change monitoring fields an autonumber field would be my suggestion to your master table and create a form which will add records. Try to avoid changing existing records if you can  its bad database design to amend existing records. Instead you should probably look at adding new records with the amended fields as new rows.,MSAccess,ci6yqye,3,t5_2tkbe

These combo boxes are called TrainingRecord TrainingRecord TrainingRecordall the way to TrainingRecord. What I would like to do is have a query where the user is required to enter a procedure  which is the value of the training record field have the query search all combo boxes on the form and then report if the procedure  entered on the prompt exists in any combo box on the form. Example Jane Doe has the following training on their form EmployeeInfoF ABC Rev New TrainingRecordMFG Rev  TrainingRecordTOOL Rev C TrainingRecordHR Rev Z TrainingRecord And John Doe has the following training on their form EmployeeInfoF TOOL Rev C TrainingRecordHR Rev Z TrainingRecord Both employees have TOOL Rev C training but they are listed in different combo boxes. The query would start by prompting the user to enter a procedure  What is the procedure ?. Then when the user enters the procedure  the query will report the name and procedure associated with that search. Therefore in my example if the user entered TOOL Rev C then the query would search each combo box for that input value and report that both employees have that training.

3132693,0,t3_2vzuas,So I dont have a lot of experience with dealing with multiple users trying to access the same records at the same time but can answer the rest of the questions for you. My database is used by multiple users but it is unlikely that they would be accessing the same data.  I know my coworker uses a variable along the lines of isOpen to ID records currently being edited and prevent other users from accessing them.  There may be an easier way to do it with the general record set connection variables i.e how you connect to the backend and how you set up your form record sets ect.. As to the other questions Any file that contains data all users would want to access should be set to the back end.  You can keep front end tables but they should be user specific.  I use some front end tables for allowing users to limit visible data or for selecting output for reports.  The rest should be back end on the server and linked into the front end. I would recommend this.  I use an onLoad function to disable or lock all fields and then have an unlock button people can push.  Additionally I limit who can actually unlock the records.  You could also link this into making sure only  person can access a record at a given time.  I personally only allow the original author  and admin to be able to unlock most records keeping the rest as read only.  I also have code for determining who can even see the records.  That being said locking is great for stopping people from accidentally editing or deleting records.  Specific access is also good at stopping malicious removal of records which we have unfortunately seen in the past this is also why we track all deletes.   Here is why everything should be back end  Multiple users should not be accessing the same front end.  A lot of people complain about access not being good for multiuser environments.  This is because they get this wrong.  Access gets funky when multiple users start to access the same front end and you are likely to see more corruptions.  We use a vbs script to launch all of our access software.  The script actually createsoverwrites a local copy of the front end on the users computer.  ,MSAccess,comp9m5,2,t5_2tkbe

4282947,0,t1_cs88h7c,It could be the way you are setting up the query.  Queries with certain types of joins are not editable.  If you go into the query itself can you modify the record?Changing the record source is a good way to solve this. But it can get tricky if you are filtering based on more than one criteria.  Alternativly you could create a query for your form and include the following expression    iifForms!formName!ToggleButton  false or PostCode  Forms!formName!txtPostcode true false and then set the criteria to true.  If you do not have the button toggled to filter and it is false all results show or if the postcode field equals either a textbox with a postcode or a static postcode if that is what you are using it only shows results where they match.If you are using a text box to allow people to search for a specific post code you can ignore a button all together and say    iifForms!frmName!txtPostCode   or Forms!frmName!txtPostCode is null or Forms!frmName!txtPostCode  postCode true falsewith criteria set to true and then use the control txtPostCode after update event to requery or refresh.  The advantage to this comes when if you decide you want to add additional filters.  Maybe someone wants to filter by road name or by entire city or by postcode or by postcode and road name or by city and road name.  It is inefficient to set up record sources for each of these.  You could build the SQL dynamically but these iif statements work fairly well and are easier to follow imho. ,MSAccess,cs8eoj6,2,t5_2tkbe

But it was so long ago that I figured out that problem that I completely forgot about it. LOLUsed to be that when you set a field to a numeric type that Access would automatically give it a default value of zero. That caused problems in many ways including relationships not to mention that oftentimes you dont want a numeric field to have a value until you enter one since a value of zero might be a valid entry.They stopped doing that in later versions. So not sure how your field got a default value of zero unless youre using an older version of Access which I presume youre not.But either way yeah default values and required  yes will trip  you up.

9501256,0,t3_5axj82,I need a little clarification here. You should be able to reasonably create a report similar to the Excel file although Excel standard files have been .xlsx for over  years not .xls. With certain understandings such that you cant resize the columnsrows in the Excel report but it can be exported to an Excel file.My question comes from the line Id specify the date ONCE at the top and have a submit that would then save all the data into the database. Access reports are run on data that already exists in the system so that running the report then saveing all the data into the database would create duplicate data which is a nono. If this is this what the solution is actually doing you may want to rethink that part.That being said you can create a form that will allow the selection of the parameters Date Machine ID Shift etc. that default to All values.The challenges here are that any dropdowncombo box controls which I assume you will use will have to be populated through VBA codebehind then Youll have to put the logic for handling the All wildcard vs. a static value into the report query. This will also cause issues in directly running the report by itself instead of launching it from the input form.  It can be done though.If youd like more information PM me to discuss.,MSAccess,d9k8dm1,1,t5_2tkbe

Then you should be able to build an Access or Excel front end to interact with it. Keep in mind this will be a database that anybody in the world can get to so you better be sure you have it well secured before you put your live data on it. Youll also need to think about how youre going to swap data back and forth in a secure manner.

If your time difference is stored in a variable called TimeDiff then you can get decimal  minutes as follows    DecimalMinutes  TimeDiff  IntTimeDiffthen you just convert that to actual minutes as follows    ActualMinutes  DecimalMinutes  Or you can combine them together as follows    ActualMinutes  TimeDiff  IntTimeDiff  Then you can get actual hours again by using Int to get the integer portion    ActualHours  IntTimeDiffThen you can combine the two into hoursminutes format as follows     Me.TotalTime  ActualHours amp  amp RoundActualMinutes The Round function will round the minutes to the specified number of decimal places in this case no decimal places.,MSAccess,dfxdl9m,1,t5_2tkbe
11528242,0,t3_64img7,You want to change newXlsxFileSpecs value right?  You are declaring it as a constant so it cannot change while your function runs.   Once a constant is declared it cannot be modified or assigned a new value.Try String newXlsxFileSpec  CUsersGebruikerDesktopStijnDatabaseproefLOGprocesgegevens van week  amp myValue amp .xlsm,MSAccess,dg2q82j,1,t5_2tkbe
11807568,0,t1_dgydvqo,Thank you so much. As I said Im new so I simply forgot to outline the table structure and all the advice online can be a maze for a novice. My tables are set up like this     FIDIslandDike NameLocation in KM above study starting pointSpecific data on the islanddike The problems I faced early on when trying to combine them with queries was that because KM has a meaning theres a lot of missing values and theres not always corresponding values for either no duplicates though. Thats why I created the key which is simply a list of all possible km values for the study area. Using that as intermediary I managed to relate the two tables to it and indirectly to each other before getting stuck completely. Could you help me some more from there with structuring the queries? I can also add screenshots if necessary. ,MSAccess,dgyfg2k,1,t5_2tkbe
