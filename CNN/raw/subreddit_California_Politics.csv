6461457,0,t3_444bl3,It bothers me.  But it is normal.  Our representative system of government is broken.  Each representative today represents  times the number of people a representative did in  when we founded our country.  That is a  fold reduction in representation.  Today I really ask How can  person effectively represent  people living in a multicultural city in a district combining many unlike areas of wealth ethnicity etc. etc. ?  Of course there is a problem when the country started that individual was expected to represent about  people.  It seems very clear that our population size and makeup absolutely require a reform to our representative democracy.  Our skills as legislators has not increased  fold so why no more representatives?  And if you look at the senate it is much worse as we have never added a new seat sticking to our Senator per State RuleOne needs support from donors support from the party and support from connections to become a candidate.  There is really no need for them to have a connection with the people and area they represent.  Look at our current representatives they dont worry about representing any of us they follow their party lines they work for their donors their parties and their own future not us.  ,California_Politics,cznnp4r,3,t5_357go

The other dangerous ones dont have nearly as good of a chance of succeeding. ,California_Politics,d9qhwd3,2,t5_357go

10390299,0,t1_dcj3gjw,Socialism means businesses are owned by their workers and that nobody is allowed to exploit someone elses labor for their own profit.In this theoretical hybrid political system you could absolutely have this.  A company solely owned by employees! Socialism is not getting a bunch of shit for free.I know there is a deeper philosophical argument to be made.  On both sides of the isle.  But in this theoretical hybrid system you could get free or very cheap healthcare and a free public educationif you wanted. Economically the Democrats have barely ever stepped left of center.Good point.  Bernie would have changed that.  . of rich people get rich without adding anything of value to societyI think . of us secretly want to be rich none the less. So is it safe to say that you do not like the idea of a hybrid system not because everyone wouldnt get their basic needs provided for while also having the ability to earn more but because there would still be people out there earning more than others??Just to be clear people would be on completely different tax and treasury systems.  Everything each party did would be insulated from another.  The taxes the socialist pay are the only taxes that get used by the government towards them and the same for the conservative party.  It would be like two governments or two countries even but everyone could essentially live wherever they wanted.          ,California_Politics,dclt0oa,1,t5_357go

11661506,0,t3_66dblx,Considering all of the states are in something of an abusive relationship with a Federal Government run amok a financial separation is only going to hurt either of us as much as we respect each other. There is no need for drama or war financially or through violence. There is no fight for freeing a slave population that rightly deserved freedom. America is an upstanding society of respectable members.If the Federal Government respects the spirit of the Federal Governments founding Constitution then it will support the People of California in their right to self determination and will proudly support the peaceful separation of free peoples exercising their liberty.On the other hand if the Federal Government has become tyrannical then it is of the utmost importance that this situation is quite clearly brought to the Peoples attention.,California_Politics,dghuhhx,2,t5_357go
