My personal favorite idea on this is extending the cap on taxable earnings beyond the approximate  I think its at now. I am apart of the generation that will likely not see a dime In social security benefits I dont mind paying the taxes if it helps others and if I can see some later thats fine too but not my priority. ,SocialSecurity,cumdf5u,1,t5_2rq3c

When completing the medical forms remember one thing..if someone hires me why could I not work...think lifting bending sitting standing walking using hands arms and thinking..sometimes people with impairments cant concentrate long enough to learn a job.gt Keeping this in mind changes how you answer the questions.

7360098,0,t3_4g4nc8,Have you called Medicare? SSA and Medicare are totally separate government programs. Its likely that somehow Medicare didnt get your paperwork or there is a delay with it and so theyve told SSA to take out the premium amount. Until they hear differently the money will likely keep coming out of your check. ,SocialSecurity,d2esjri,1,t5_2rq3c

8583092,0,t1_d6cpcba,Right. I can speak for the analysis though too. DFor most people most of the time taking benefits earlier is better than later  especially married people.There are situations where waiting is the better choice but thats not what this article is saying. This article is saying without even considering those situation wait! You need individual analysis for the person before you wait!The house insurance comparison is ridiculous.I posted an article yesterday. The two articles are related. The article I put up discredits Lawrence Kotlikoff this article praises him. Although the article doesnt even bother to state it Lawrence wrote that book Get Whats Yours.,SocialSecurity,d6eh0lr,2,t5_2rq3c

9361540,0,t3_4y0zcy,SSI is painfully nerve racking. From personal experience Social Security somehow knows when I start working part time without notifying SSA directly which is understandable. However when I stopped working because my disability worsened I had to call multiple times on hold for up to a few hours and ultimately had to go to the SSA office to provide proof that I was no longer working which was a four hour endeavor even arriving an hour before opening. They cut my SSI benefits over half due to information they concluded that I was earning over  monthly working part time no less than  hours on minimum wage. SSA seems to be extremely behind with my earnings from working. I literally only worked long enough for two paychecks Its experiences like this that makes it where its easier to NOT enter the workforce because its not worth the hassle of wondering if SSA will mess up benefits that are essential to prevent homelessness. ,SocialSecurity,d92n5fn,1,t5_2rq3c
11209243,0,t3_5zyj5w,Please refer to this website  This is a common misconception.  At the earliest youll be able to file at .Due to the recent legislation passed by Congress Bipartisant Budget Act of  the scenario you are referring to is no longer an option.If you turn age  on or after January   you are required or deemed to file for both your own retirement and for any benefits you are due as a spouse no matter what age you are.Also your k withdrawals will not impact your Social Security benefits.  Work is another story though.  If you do return to work Social Security will reduce your benefits  for every  you earn past .EDIT Only addressed spousal benefit not widow benefit which is a different set of rules and calculations.,SocialSecurity,df2jzo0,0,t5_2rq3c
