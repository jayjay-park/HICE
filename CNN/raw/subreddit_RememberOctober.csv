5781077,0,t1_cxdoksm,Baku and Krasnoyarsk already taken by Sibir. I counted  caravels Soviet has that region almost no melee units. And  frigates and  caravel Sibir has. Also main problem that cities are coastal and Sibir has lots of Riflemans and some Artilery what sink Soviet ships. I hope Stalin will loose only Baku Krasnoyarsk and probably Kuibushev. Since moving by land to Gorky and Sverdlovsk will stretch Sibir land army in line through Finns territory and could be dealt easier.Main and most danger I see in the answer for a question what are Finns going to do since Finns provide open borders for Sibir? If they join Sibir it will be second Byzantum. ,RememberOctober,cxdp43u,2,t5_39h7k
