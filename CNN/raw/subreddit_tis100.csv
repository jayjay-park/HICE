4204260,0,t3_38zk38,gtProgram nodes with partially or entirely noneditable content. Maybe even convert the existing corrupted nodes to noneditable program nodes with only comments in them.I had that idea too but Im not sure how much interesting design space it actually opens up re level design.Maybe theres some cool things you can do with it but I really do like it from a flavour point of view. It fits even better with the idea of fixing corrupted code than the game does right now currently its more write an entire program from scratch given these specsRe JRO and JMP like other people have said thats the nature of an absolute jump and a relative jump command they work how theyre meant to work.,tis100,crzh4y4,3,t5_38azi

4597372,0,t3_3dujuy,Very nice for a low instruction count!Finding the second largest element in an unsorted collection of size n is a pretty interesting problem in general. Particularly because it has a very unintuitive nature. For example it would be easy to think something along the lines of    secondmaxarray      max  maxarray array  largest      max  maxarray array  second largest      for i..n in array        if arrayi gt max          max  max          max  arrayi        else if arrayi gt max          max  arrayi      return maxis the fastest possible solution. But actually it requires n   comparisons and there is actually a faster way.Imagine discovering the maximum through a tournament such as this It takes n   comparisons to find the maximum since every element must be tested. However now that we have found it we have an awesome trick for finding the second maximum.Consider that the second maximum did not win the tournament and so it must have lost at some point. It can only lose to the maximum and so the second maximum must be one of the elements that the maximum was directly compared against. So going back to our tournament it can only be one of the circled items as shownSo how many items lost to the maximum? Well suppose that the maximum was involved in k comparisons. It follows that it could have only superseded k elements but we know it superseded n elements and so it must have been involved in log n comparisons. Since the maximum itself wont be the second maximum we exclude it and we only have to check log n   elements to find our second maximum.So we actually only need n    log n    n  log n   comparisons to find our maximum and if the number of elements n is fixed then we have a very direct way of finding the second maximum. For example for  elements    secondmaxa b c d      if a gt b  st comparison        p  a q  b      else        p  b q  a      if c gt d  nd comparison        r  c s  d      else        r  d s  c      if p gt r  rd comprison        return maxq r  th comparison      else        return maxp s  th comparisonAnd thats why my solution only took  cycles Now everyone will make a better solution that requires clever TIS tricks Im bad at implementing. ,tis100,cta387p,6,t5_38azi

4803394,0,t3_3goanx,I do a quick first pass and if Im significantly to the left of the peak in happy. I tend to ignore the obvious anomalous oak at the lowest number of cycles because thats indicative of people using walk thrus... And for this game why? Doesnt that ruin all the fun!For some of the later puzzles I have got the whiteboard out and made flow charts but thats not always good for optimization I found the best savings were in finding unusual ways not logical ways of performing sub tasks.So Im all for quick and dirty but the challenge of optimizing cycles eats me alive until I work on the problem.,tis100,cu00afk,1,t5_38azi
4857742,0,t1_cu6o2y9,I think you overestimate the DOS era.  TIS uses an approximately x character display which is more than  times greater than the typical DOS resolution x.The arrows between nodes and the playstepfast controls could not be rendered correctly in text mode.And the most glaring flaw is that you cannot play TIS without a mouse unless Im missing something and there actually are keyboard shortcuts to navigate the menus.,tis100,cu6usbp,3,t5_38azi

7485440,0,t1_d2szr2i,I do did not have any specific suggestions right now when starting this post.Thinking through it now there are two or three things that might not have been thought of. The cycle count in the game is not necessarily the same as the cycle count on the chips as you point out variances in cycles for commands in one of the posts. Having a gamecorrect cycle counttick might be desireable especially with the more obscure solutions where any and last are used for multiple adjacent cells.The other thing is how the out values are MOVed onto a stack between cells and removed when read. This is important for the any command. Unread values and simultaneous writes are the cause for most of my halting bugs. Depending on how you are transferring values this might be an issue.In the later stages of the standard campaign there is also introduced a visualization module with  colours. This might be harder to emulate depending. Outputs in general might be troublesome? Unless the final board is designed to be headless of course.There are also some stack cells basically making a cell turn into a first in last out stack writeable and readable from any adjacent cell. These are used a lot ingame especially for sorting lists and stuff. This should not really pose a big problem with your current setup? It feels more like a secondary feature.Breakpoints are missing but I guess they should not be needed if testingdebugging can be done in the game itself.Looks like I at least had some thoughts. I can easily expand on any of this if I am not clear.I should make a hackaday account. But that will have to wait until tomorrow.,tis100,d2t1xs4,2,t5_38azi
