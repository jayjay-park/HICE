3983293,0,t1_cr9zbez,An important distinction is that depression is a treatable condition not a terminal illness. End stage cancer is terminal. Choosing when and how ones life will end to avoid the inevitable suffering of cancer is one thing. Choosing suicide instead of to not treat a treatable condition especially given how ones decision making is affected by the condition itself is very different.,badpsychology,crabwz9,4,t5_2yukq

8047191,0,t3_4peo8d,Wasnt particularly moved by this video but many of my Facebook friends were it seems. I dont really see much point in the video feelings of depression and being depressed are fortunately and unfortunately part of a humans identity.It is also a mental illness it can be compared to cancer in that sure you personally are not cancer but it is part of your identity and life from the moment youre diagnosed.This is a video aimed at motivation not at fixing the issues depression causes  its about making you feel good in the moment.,badpsychology,d4kkw87,2,t5_2yukq
