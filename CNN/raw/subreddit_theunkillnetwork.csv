10084653,0,t3_5k7tni,Thats just my speculation but I believe these whatsapp rumours to be generated party volunteers. They are the ones who do ground work of interacting and carrying party message to common people. No matter how bad the decision of BJP is youll always see that twitter is always roaring in support of BJP government. Always making fun of Rahul Gandhi theyve almost hacked the social media and are creating environment in favour of their own party. Making trolls against anyone whos against their party or point of view. We should be aware of these people while reading these whatsapp forwards. ,theunkillnetwork,dbm1rk7,12,t5_3hhrw
