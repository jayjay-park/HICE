2762047,0,t3_2rp1st,I think trust is the most useful moral construct in this situation. The caregiver needs to be able to trust the patient to express her true wishes and the patient has to be able to trust the caregiver to provide for her wishes as best he can.When the lucid patient asks caregiver to withhold the medication during her next pain state he should tell her whether or not he plans to comply. If the pain is so unbearable that it is medically harmful to her the caregiver should refuse. If there is some other reason he doesnt feel comfortable promising to withhold the medications he should tell her this as well when she first asks.If the caregiver does agree to withhold the medication however thats what he should do. ,moraldilemmas,cni18sz,9,t5_35rbh

2799508,0,t1_cnma8dx,Says me but you dont have to listen to me. Ive been through some shit though.Some of the most painful parts of my life were before I had learned much. The most painful part of the pain wasnt the pain  it was the confusion. The sense of unfairness. The sense of betrayal by the world by others. There was an overwhelming What did I do to deserve this?? that made everything seem unbearable and that it might all be worth something never even crossed my mind. Eventually I learned though that pain is worth something  and thought of it afterward as emotional weightlifting. At the very least pain is a chance to get stronger and something to be thankful for. A life with too little pain crumples at the slightest inconvenience. But if youve been through some shit you can get through some shit and you know you can. But thats just the beginning.It was all brought back when my little brother went through his first major heartbreak. I saw the same anguish I had gone through years earlier the confusion  how the hell why the hell  didnt she love me?? Yes she did but you were both unskillful. Trying to have a relationship is like trying to balance one bowling ball on top of another. Both of you have to be completely attuned to each others movements and if you stop paying attention and just get drunk on the bliss of it things can get out of balance fast. It doesnt mean anything except that there are still skills to learn  there is still sense to make out of it  and once you have that sense you dont make the same mistakes again. So pain is not only emotional weightlifting but a chance to figure something out and never have to feel that same pain again. Youll feel pain again but not that pain. Not for that reason. Youll get further next time. It will hurt the same but bother you less because youll know you only have to feel it once and then youll be more skillful forever.The unfairness can be done away with when your question changes from What did I do to deserve this? to How did I make this happen so I can avoid making this happen again in the future?This is why I say theres no pain without purpose because every pain is a piece of your power over your life telling you to reclaim it. Every piece of pain is saying You can choose to never put yourself in this position again.Ive found the guys over at rhowtonotgiveafuck to be a helpful bunch as well.,moraldilemmas,cnmakxj,1,t5_35rbh

In my perception of morality allowing a creature to die is less onerous than actively causing a death. I further expect that consuming the meat would be psychologically easier if I couldnt identify which animal I am consuming comparable to the use of blank rounds included in firing squad executions.,moraldilemmas,cumxr8r,4,t5_35rbh

7712865,0,t1_d3hfbbo,Well. First of all thank you for the reply.When she gets upset she enters a state of complete disregard of anyone.Yelling or saying she will move or she has had enough. I find that to be a protective response since she was kind of neglected in the past by what i have learned from talking to her.So i brush these off since after she calms down she apologises and is really sorry she said all those things.Also she gets mad on simple things like when i have to go out with my friends Which she hates she will say everything is fine but will still pout and be unreasonable for a while. Still a thing i find to be normal for her current state of mind. Trust is hard to earn and i do not plan to betray it. But sometimes it is hard given that harsh words from someone you love hurt like a motherfucker.,moraldilemmas,d3iwf58,1,t5_35rbh
