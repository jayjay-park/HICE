149371,0,t3_1vreo5,This would be a great idea lets say if the  regularly saw griefing and attacking. But what would the UEF United Expeditionary Force be doing for the  weeks or so that nothing was going on? What if for a month nothing happened? How would this Force work if say one of the towns is attacked when say only a quarter of the force is on and by the time they can assemble those who have attacked are long gone? I am not saying all this to be an ass merely playing the role as Devils Advocate. ,UnitedProvinces,cevfzyq,1,t5_2ze2x

874498,0,t1_ch3oc5g,That doesnt tell me how the map derailed kek your defense plans. Everyone knows Pella exists. The only thing that makes it private is the lack of published coords which still has yet to be done. Anyone with half a brain cell knows that most if not all cities have some form of international rail. Again confirmation of that fact does not create an increase of danger as they would still have to know where the rail is another detail not placed on that map. It is for the most part harmless. You guys have got to stop living in such fear. Pella still gets to enjoy their privacy. Wow now there is a line specifying a rail exists which is something Im sure everyone has known. Its something even I knew the first day in Pella because well Perdikkas showed me the rail station. For a nation trying hard not to be another random  town there is often pretty high efforts to privatize it and seclude it.. making it pretty random. Either way that is the choice of Pella and I respect that. As did the map maker because he could have just as easily included coords if he really didnt give a shit about it. If this map is truly that big of a detriment then you have just successfully shown the entire server how illprepared you are for anything by speaking out so loudly against something that revealed general locations without as much as a single coordinate. Besides for you Pellans out there... what the hell do you think the only unmarked territory on the map is when the rest of the cities of the  are there? Can we stop pretending Pella is some kind of super secret entity and accept that the days of it being truly private died long before this map ever existed?,UnitedProvinces,ch3ones,1,t5_2ze2x

This allows bounty hunters to come on our land to collect non UP criminals while people are offline. If they collect the bounty without our permission and they are someone we dont want pearledor want some say over what happens to the pearl we stick a bounty on the bounty hunter until we receive that pearl and the bounty hunter has paid suitable reps e.g. the cost of the bounty we placedwhat he got for collecting the bounty. ,UnitedProvinces,coxsbsk,1,t5_2ze2x

However if they are looking for it to be some organization which tries to standardize punishments and pearling procedures Im not so keen on it. Time will tell I guess.
