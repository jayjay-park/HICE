6714109,0,t3_47jhu8,Im not sure if this is due to my opponents having bad internet connection or if Im just missing something new with this game. Ive been an avid storm player for years but for some reason this game is becoming the hardest for me to become decent at.If anyone can give me some tips or pointers it would be greatly appreciated.One of the biggest issues Im having right now is performing combos. I know that sounds ridiculous but Ive been doing the same thing for years. Chakra dash gt Attack Attack gt Opponent Substitutes Chakra Dash gt Attack Attack etc. However right now Its been going like this Chakra Dash gt Attack Attack Opponent Substitutes Chakra Dashes and attacks me this is before I am able to chakra dash to his substitute myself and attack him. However my biggest frustration is I am unable to perform the inverse to him. If I substitute to my opponent it is a guarantee that he will be able to dash to me and attack me with no chance of me dashing to him and attacking him.That is the largest gripe I am having. Another one is my combos often never stop. If I press circle once or twice I will often continue the entire combo even if I am trying to dash away. However I am able to see my opponent end their combos early. Am I missing something there?Now Im also getting frustrated with guarding. When I guard it seems my opponent is able to break through by the time they finish a combo however my opponents guard is like the yata mirror shield itself able to withstand an infinite number of combos ultimate jutsus fireballs and more. Is there more to using guard than to simply holding it? How does one make it more resilient? The next issue with guard Im having goes back to my Chakra dash combo issues. When my opponent substitutes in the middle of a combo he seems to be able to guard immediately However if my opponent is using a combo on me and I substitute I am completely unable to use guard before he can dash to me and begin attacking me.I am also only having these problems online and not when I battle someone in person which is why I believe it could be the online service or my opponents connection. Or I could be challenging players who have a better understanding of the game which is something Id like to learn.If anyone has any solutions to these issues Im having please give me a reply if you have any guides tutorials or anything they may pertain to them please let me know as well.,NarutoNinjaStorm,d0dsomj,3,t5_3cahy
