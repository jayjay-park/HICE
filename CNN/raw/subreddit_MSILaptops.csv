5119753,0,t1_cv2iwwd,Thanks  I was wondering if they would.Still pretty unimpressed with the MSI supportcommunication relating to this though ,MSILaptops,cv34ewy,1,t5_2y4t7
5979271,0,t3_3xai7u,Whoever listed the specifications could have neglected to mention that the wireless card could be m. and the second port is in fact not compatible with an SSD since its occuped by the wifi card. Could have been a mistake. Could be that the specific model you bought doesnt have that port.,MSILaptops,cy3ew56,2,t5_2y4t7
7196854,0,t3_4b2xgy,Yes there is. In StealSeries Engine make three configurations. One for eco one for comfort and for performance.Then edit the key that controls Shift on your keyboard inside the configuration. For example on mine its FnF so I edit the F key inside the configuration and from the list drop down menu choose Launch Configuration and youll have a list from the configurations you can choose from. Do this for all three configuration so that each one activates the second. I cant remember the order and Im not plugged in but I think its eco gt comfort gt performance. So in eco configuration make the F launch comfort and in comfort make F launch Performance and in Performance make F launch comfort. That way each time you press F or FnF the configuration will change. Make sure to pick the SteelSeries configuration that matches the current Shift state before you exit.The only downside is that even if you press F on its own the configuration will change but I rarely press F for anything.,MSILaptops,d1w825y,1,t5_2y4t7

8440612,0,t1_d5wjfip,I was registered with a warranty previously right when I got it. It took about  days to get it back if you count the weekend. I called MSI and they made an RMA number. I just sent it directly to MSI with that RMA number and they did the rest.I will say however that when I got it back it had a new problem TWICE. When I got it back the first time the headphone jack was broken. I sent it back and received it again and now the sound in general on the laptop just randomly dies at times until I restart. They payed for shipping the nd time and now I am sending it again soon with free express shipping because of this. They are going to replace the whole motherboard this time. Hoping it goes well because Im kind of sick of sending it in.,MSILaptops,d5wm5u0,1,t5_2y4t7

8713255,0,t3_4za7j2,I had a GS with the same issue. In particular it seemed to be coming from the underside of the laptop. The fact that it never caught fire was quite a feature.,MSILaptops,d6uslbn,1,t5_2y4t7
8983921,0,t3_53bi2s,I havent tested this with the onboard microphone and I dont recommend using those anyway on any laptop but if youre going to use a headset microphone or a desk microphone it will probably be fine. The fans will kick in quite hard when doing something gpu and cpu intensive like gaming but I think theyre not too loud to be uncomfortable and a microphone thats not close to the fans will not pick up too much of it. When just browsing the internet or watching youtube the fans are barely audible and you can set your own fan profile to get full control.I did have to RMA once because the CPU fan was rattling there seem to be a lot of quality control problems right now with the latest VR laptops but the replaced model works fine for me.,MSILaptops,d7rq9o6,1,t5_2y4t7
9203020,0,t3_56dxz2,This is a real shit show. MSI cant deliver on the promise yet is using this as an opportunity to extract even more money from us AND they want our current laptops in pristine condition so they can resell them refurbed. This is not how I expected to be treated by a company after Ive spent over  on their products. Time to go medieval legal on their asses.We need to unite and burn them to the ground.,MSILaptops,d8iju27,5,t5_2y4t7

10249237,0,t3_5m57gx,Either the HDD is not  or theres something wrong. Another fault can be the sata port or maybe even not updated sata driver from Intel check win update.If you can open it you can put the HDD in a case enclosure and check it out elsewhere if its the hardware itself. In the end it would be a better idea to call it defective and take it to the store you brought it and get a replacement if you still can  if nothing is possible either talk to MSi RMA support thing or try alternatives. ,MSILaptops,dc5t2wb,1,t5_2y4t7

10402522,0,t3_5ov0ty,I bought the gtvr with hz and gsync. Runs great! Temps are great aswell dont have to repaste. Witcher  max settings  fanspeed   Celsius max. On GPU. Can even run on higher speeds for more cooling but its nice and quiet. CPU is at  at   fanspeed. Best bang for the bucks,MSILaptops,dcn6y94,2,t5_2y4t7
10664800,0,t1_ddfz7bp,Well if you use the external GPU youre not using the internal one so thats the majority of the laptops heat gone.  The Core itself heats up with its GPU though.,MSILaptops,ddfzr92,1,t5_2y4t7
10812831,0,t1_ddv5w1m,Im not sure when I did my clean install though I upgraded to pro I got the standard windows  backgroundfan curves mean you can set the fan speed at a certain temperature rather than having windows set it all for you.so I have my fans not move until i hit c so that my laptop stays silent when Im just typing or browsing the web,MSILaptops,ddv9mt4,2,t5_2y4t7

11118236,0,t1_des7w5q,Ok thanks for the info. Ill probably run over to Best Buy tomorrow and look. This Malibal with the Sharp K IGZO  looks like a contender too but Ive never heard of them.,MSILaptops,des8r6w,1,t5_2y4t7
11339111,0,t3_60ksar,Im also thinking of returning mine.  Got here on Friday.  Cant seem to get any of my headsets microphones to work with the onboard audio without having to yell into them.  When played back through that crappy N software I can hear myself okay.  Steam Skype Adobe Audition Teamspeak Audacity the microphone is way too quiet.  Ive tried looking at the microphone level updating the realtek driver uninstalling the N software still...same issue.  Not to mention the first time I unplugged a headset the gold ring for the  headphone input fell out.  Really disappointed.,MSILaptops,dfh9obn,1,t5_2y4t7
