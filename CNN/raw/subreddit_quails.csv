9801927,0,t1_dal2i1g,Thanks for the great tips. The trouble makers always seem to taste the best I find. I had just bought the whole group of them where they lived in a larger group of maybe  birds they should have been familiar already but oh well. These are my only birds as I only just started with quails so I wont be eating them so quickly but again thank you for the advice. I will just keep the extra male in the corner in case my main roo is infertile.,quails,dalarcr,1,t5_2uah3
