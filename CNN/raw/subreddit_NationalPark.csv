5087216,0,t1_cuz188r,We did it in a minivan but if the road is wet it becomes impassable. Checking the nps site or there is a visitor center in Cannonville UT to check the conditions if you are in the area. If you do get to do the road...where the picture is taken is a cool slot canyon on the right. You can do it as an out and back or it loops back to the road with a hike back to the car along the road. The Grosvenor Arch is also located on the North part of the road. ,NationalPark,cuz7ah0,2,t5_38nec
5222323,0,t1_cvfh5kp,We hike a decent amount but Id just done a  mile hike in Colorado the day before followed by the primitive loop at Arches in some really awful shoes so I had some huge blisters by the time we hit Canyonlands. It is amazing there though. We went to the North rim of the Grand Canyon and I actually like Canyonlands better. Especially due to the fact that you can get away from the crowds and be pretty much completely alone if you want.Hah! I love the ravens! Its fun to watch them go about their business  so freaking intelligent.Midsummer is offseason for a lot of the eateries so Lovemuffin may have been closed. We had to eat at the Jailhouse Cafe instead one year which was also pretty good. Theres a burrito truck  or so minutes away in Green River that is very worth checking out as well.If you ever get back and youre coming from the Colorado side or just want to take a nice drive get off on the Cisco exit of  turn off on  and take it straight south into Moab. Its a freaking beautiful drive along the Colorado river.,NationalPark,cvfhcvi,2,t5_38nec

Ones like these are all on first come basis and range in size on this circuit from  up to  bunks for NZD a night. Although Ive got an annual backcountry hut pass which is incredibly good value at  a year. ,NationalPark,cyl09iz,2,t5_38nec

This view was captured using a Canon D and Samyang mm lens  second single exposure at ISO  and f. tripod mounted. Enjoy! Photo Blog www.leisurelyscientist.com,NationalPark,d39iyps,1,t5_38nec
7791163,0,t1_d3rohiv,I dont know if thats really accurate. They may know it somewhere in the back of their minds but that doesnt mean theyre actively aware of it. These people see places like Yellowstone as tourist attractions rather than as the wild places that they really are. Theyre not evil just stupid. ,NationalPark,d3rs84a,2,t5_38nec

Perhaps well save the RV for somewhere a little closer to home.You said that there might be snow in Maydo you recommend June instead?

I have a question though  how were you able to use that music on your video Im assuming its copyrighted without Youtube automatically deleting your video? I ask because I put together a slideshow of a week road trip including these Utah parks! and I use well copyrighted music as the background. I really only want it to show my family members its not to make a profit or anything ,NationalPark,d6ogo5h,2,t5_38nec

10682636,0,t1_ddhkjbc,I dont know if youre looking for me but this is a post of a news article by a legitimate news organization unlike this post so I have no complaint. Aside from that I dont find it particularly alarming. Its just a resolution it has no practical effect. Utah is saying what it wants which is fine. Changing things is another matter. My understanding is that the national monument cant be fully undone but it could be modifiedreduced. But even if it were completely undone wed go back to where we were a few months ago and nobody was panicked then.Edit ... nobody wasnt was panicked then.,NationalPark,ddhu02k,2,t5_38nec
