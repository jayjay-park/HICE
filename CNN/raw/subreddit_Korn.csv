1479390,0,t1_cj1cvii,gt Your average metal elitism also comes into play. People who like nu metal usually listen to more metal and go on to enjoy the more extreme subgenres containing more sophisticated or deep lyrical themes and more complex instrumentation. Its fine if you think that nothing is better than music about how shit Christianity is compared to our Almighty Lord Satan or whatever but some of these guys make the mistake of shitting all over anything that isnt super obscure  even if they liked it a year before they started listening to whatever it is that makes them feel superior. I think that this is sometimes a social thing that people do because they dont want peers to scoff at them and I suspect that a lot of the irrational hate stems from this trend.This attitude is so prevalent in so many genres of music. I dont understand why people have the need to bash other peoples music tastes. Art is subjective and people will like different things.gtFinally for this comment the declining quality of music probably explains some hatred for nu metal as well. I have to say that I was pretty pissed when Korn put out The Path of Totality or Teapot as I like to call it. But you have to endure it and stick around because better music is always inevitable and you end up feeling like an arse when it eventually surfaces if you abandon a given band.I thought The Path of Totality was an awesome album. I like electronic music though and I really liked Korns spin on it.,Korn,cj1ptzg,3,t5_2t53k

9359169,0,t3_58phh5,Im actually surprised by how much I like it. Korn will always be my favorite band and I love all of their albums but until now everything after Take A Look In The Mirror just seemed a little off to me TALITM was the latest Korn release at the time of my discovering them I think I was maybe  years old. This album brings me back to that time reminds me of how I felt the first time I played a Korn album from start to finish. Its wonderful. So heavy so angry so new yet still classic Korn so well written all the way around. The lyrics on The Paradigm Shift are the reason that album is my least favorite of theirs and Im so glad to say that its not the case here. I dont think Korn will ever be the same without David Silveria but SOS gets pretty damn close and I fucking love it.,Korn,d92cbyn,8,t5_2t53k
9359967,0,t3_58phh5,Im going in with my thoughts. First of all the production is top notch Nick did an amazing job bringing out the best of the band. I love the melodic choruses some do feel a bit forced.. Ill say that.  The guitar tone is amazing and rivals most melodic metal bands out today. As a whole this feels like a true honest Korn album. There is enough throwback to satiate my inner Korn fan. I wont compare this to untouchables or issues and honestly I wouldnt put this against any Korn album. If I never knew who this band was this album back to back would keep my attention. I love it. I wont give it a  out of  simply because theyve made better albums than this..but in  this is a masterpiece.,Korn,d92fz1y,3,t5_2t53k
