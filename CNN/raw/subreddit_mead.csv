76121,0,t3_1uyxos,I would do it this way Put just the honey and taptemperature water into the jug at first. Fill the jug only to around ths to leave room for more ingredients. Cap that and shake it until the water and honey is wellmixed. Add other ingredients. Top the jug up to nearly  gallon with water if necessary. Leave room for about ml more liquid that will come with the yeast pitch. Take a hydrometer reading. I hope you got a hydrometer test tube. See this YouTube video for how to use a hydrometer. As a note the scale youll want to use is specific gravity SG or Brix. I prefer SG. Make sure all of that equipment is sanitized as well. Microwave in a sanitized container ml of water until FF CC. My microwave takes  seconds. Pitch the yeast onto this and wait  minutes. Stir it in with a sanitized utensil and wait another ten minutes. Pitch onto the must and give it another shakeup. Airlock it place somewhere dark with a steady temperature. Monitor the airlock fermentation may be vigorous and cause the airlock to blow off.When you post a temperature in this or any homebrewing sub it helps if you say whether its F or C. This time considering C is F its easy to figure out.,mead,cen3fgl,2,t5_2rcsz

Youd have a bigger risk from reusing bottles that once held wheat beer as the volume to surface area is greater. Even then I dont suspect the amount of gluten to be even measurable honestly I dont think thered be any if you cleaned well.Cross contamination with living organisms bacteria wild yeast etc... is a concern not because you expect a large number to remain after washing but that if just one or two remain theyll multiply. Gluten will not multiply its just a protein not a whole organism so he should be safe as even if a few molecules somehow cling to the carboy its very unlikely hed consume them or itd be safely below his tolerance level.

169952,0,t1_cexqjab,They used a copper pipe copper is not ferromagnetic. Im not sure what the ferromagnetic objects youre talking about are unless you include the iron ball used at the start and are counting the magnet as ferromagnetic. The experiment shows induction happening in a copper pipe.It does appear you are right about pans though. I looked it up and although copper does allow induction it doesnt support induction cooking. Quoth wikipediagt Aluminum or copper alone does not work on an induction stove because of the materials magnetic and electrical properties. Aluminum and copper cookware are more conductive than steel and the skin depth in these materials is larger since they are nonmagnetic. The current flows in a thicker layer in the metal encounters less resistance and so produces less heat. The induction cooker will not work efficiently with such pots.,mead,cexsgxs,1,t5_2rcsz

Be careful with them though mulberries are a bit fragile and will easily burst the juice is one hell of a dye too so try to wear something you dont mind going through a color change to purple.    Another way to gather the berries is to put a tarp under the tree and shake the branches the ripe berries will fall down but so will some others.

2169189,0,t3_2jvyfx,ThatMeadGuy here!  This may be an unpopular opinion around here but consider making a cyser without all the added spices.  When I first started brewing I made nothing but hard cider for a few years.  Freshpressed cider treated with one campden tablet per gallon left to sit for  hours then add lbs of sugar and a Wyeast cider smack pack.  It always finished a bit sweet and oh boy was it good.  Fastforward a few years and Ive started making mead.  So what do I do?  Replace the sugar with honey leaving everything else the same.  The result was pure awesome and cleared much faster than my other mead endeavors.  I put a bit of oak into secondary before bottling and oh my.  I never did get around to experimenting with spices because I didnt want to detract from the impressive flavor Id obtained without it.  Nothing can beat freshpressed unpasteurized apple cider in my experience.  Start with the best ingredients and youre bound to end with an amazing beverage.  Im sure some of the spiced cyser recipes are amazing as well but keep in mind the spices are going to cover some of the fruitiness of the cider and in my opinion are better used on a subpar apple cider such as storebought pasteurized or filtered.  If you go the spice route go low and slow.,mead,clfjz3r,7,t5_2rcsz
2170090,0,t1_clfjlg9,This is what I used its basically just really strong cold brew. The issues I had came from trying to cut down a sack mead recipe and I had added too much vanilla. I see no reason not to use the yeast youre familiar with I had a crazy strong ferment with WLP. It bottomed out at less than . but still had a good residual sweet flavor. I think Ds good for that at well right? ,mead,clfo3rk,3,t5_2rcsz

2228687,0,t1_cln3yt1,Well make sure to do a proper SNA if youre going with  lbs or more of honey. It will help to ensure that fermentation goes along well and doesnt get stuck. You could predetermine the amount of DAP FermaidK and FermaidO needed for a batch using ubalathustriuss calculator check his shared files on google drive. Then pitch all your FO in once you see yeast activity and then divide and add equal parts DAP  FK once a day for  days after pitching. His white paper on the subject is also extremely helpful for understanding the process. It can be pretty tricky to get just the right amount of sweetness without using sulfites to stabilize and backsweeten. Its not impossible by any means its just a little more difficult.  lbs of honey is no small task for a yeast to dry out. Youre looking at gt abv when many wine yeasts tend to putter out around . Once again its not impossible just a bit more difficult.,mead,cln4awa,2,t5_2rcsz

2283981,0,t3_2ldfl0,When it comes to yeast I quite literally have a notebook that Ive built on yeasts over the years. This may sound silly but if youre really really interested in building a yeast profile make   gallon batches using the exact same components and methods and change nothing but the yeast and see how each reacts with your honey selection.  Do this about  times and youll have a notebook as well.  My personal favorites are Vinters Harvest VR and Vinters Harvest SN. Both treat the honey very well and allow a lot of the flavor to go through.  I definitely agree with the sentiment that the EC has the finesse of a battering ram. Its great for getting the ABV waaaaay up there but by the end of it you have jet fuel. Ive pushed EC to  before and immediately regretted it. Itll get you drunk fast but you wont enjoy it. The Lalvin b isnt a bad strain at all either and I use it on occasion to ferment without sulfites as I have a friend that is sulfite sensitive. ,mead,clu0mk1,2,t5_2rcsz

2313036,0,t1_clxjqea,I here ya!! Weve all been there. Dont worry youll pick it up pretty quickly. Its almost daunting your first batch as you want to do everything right. The thing youll learn is mead is generally pretty forgiving. Except for sanitation. Take that seriously and err on the side of being overcautious. You can pretty much deal with any miscalculations too dry too sweet unbalanced not clearing stuck fermentation etc. but its nearly impossible to fix a lot of the offflavors that can result from contamination. You learn the most just by doing it and asking questions. Regarding bottling DONT RUSH IT!! If you bottle before the fermentation is finished you could leave yourself with bottle grenades fermentation in bottle gt pressure buildup gt exploding bottles. Err on the side of leaving it too long. If you continue with brewingrelated activities youll want to invest in a hydrometer. Thatll eliminate the guess work. In the mean time wait for it to clear to the point you can read through the liquid. If you question whether its done wait a little longer. Once its clear enough bottle it. After that its usually best to let it sit  months though most are drinkable before then. I think its smart to go with the mixing option. Theyre very good. Writing my first response to you got me craving meadmosas. Picked up some OJ and about to crack a bottle of my original batch!! ,mead,clxluh0,2,t5_2rcsz
2354589,0,t1_cm2pbke,So far Im pretty sure I didnt mess up a JAOM despite doing almost everything in the worst possible way.Oh Ill just tip out some water and add the honey. Crap I didnt tip out enough water. Well I guess I can add more honey later right?  Oh it stopped bubbling. I guess I should add that betterthanbreadyeast I bought in the past week and transfer it to a proper carboy with airlock no more balloon!  and that way I can add the extra honey.Hmm... I think its degassing. Im terrified of bottlebombs. Better add a campton and move it to a colder spot. Crap I got the sodium camptons. Oh well...Yeah. I think as long as youre really patient and if you seriously meant a  month batch look up BOMM and start studying. Also dont buy lb of honey before you taste it  especially if its pricey.

2354663,0,t1_cm2p95g,Hmm.Timetodrinkable is as much about process as it is about ingredients. If you do SNA and aeration in a temperature controlled environment and use finings you can have clear drinkable mead in a month and it will only get better from there and I strongly advocate patience.Heartbound Hibiscus is among my favorites  its a recipe I made for a friends wedding and one of the handful that will be part of my initial commercial offering.

2375792,0,t3_2mllqk,You should leave the fruit behind when you rack over to a second container which is typically after primary fermentation.

2377044,0,t3_2mlvhu,The time it takes to become drinkable largely depends upon the recipe and the fermentation.

There are recipes out there that are by design made to be drinkable with a quick turnaround. The BOMM Brays One Month Mead is formulated in just a way that you can produce a decent product in as little as  month.

2460829,0,t1_cmfsbvn,Ha! Your gravity is probably out of the hydrometers range all that honey in only half a gallon youre probably looking at SG  . and a potential gravity of  based on you not diluting it which you will and it fermenting dry which it wont. So long as it gets going that might work. If it doesnt start fermenting or gets stuck you might need to dilute it a bit. If it does get stuck i.e. the gravity doesnt drop for several days but is still high there are plenty of instructions online on how to get it going again.Good luck and keep us posted!

2546810,0,t3_2ovt0h,Man you just couldnt cant ask for a better illustration of my point about the original JAOM recipe.Did you use an orange as opposed to a clementine or similar? Did you remove the pith? If so sure consider making a starter and repitching with a champagne yeast. Itll take the mead very dry but it should be drinkable and you can always back sweeten.Otherwise its a hard call. Can you taste the pithy bitterness at this point? If not maybe risk it. If so decide whether you like bitter drinks. If youre an IPA fan go for it. If not... you still have options.. Add acid blend. It doesnt take much though and youll need a gram scale or some luck to get it right.  grams per five gallons is about right for that final gravity. So you probably want  grams but start at like  grams taste and add more if you think the mead needs it. Itll still be sweet but it shouldnt seem so much like sugar water.. Turn it into an aperitif. Fortify it with brandy to about  abv give it a couple of years to age and enjoy about an ounce before nice dinners.. Make another orange spice mead. Use wine yeast and let it go compleately dry then stabilize and blend. Final gravity should clock in at . or so.Edit Downvoted for this with no response?

2745381,0,t3_2rhbt9,I think one of the big reasons mead is not a big player in the alcohol industry is that it doesnt have its own place. Macro beer is for the lawnmower the parties the college student its cheap and can be drank in large quantities for hours. Micro beer has its place among hobbyists hipsters and enthusiasts as something to cherish and enjoy for the expression of creativity andor mastery of the brew. CiderPerry and the like have their place with those who enjoy something the strength of a beer but with a much different flavor profile in the US often being much sweeter. Wine has long been paired with fine dining relaxing and reading a book or having a romantic date. Spirits have their utility of getting people blitzed quicker than any other beverage and have endless possibilities with the different beverages they can be mixed with. but mead? where does mead stand? Its market is somewhat of a mix between wine and cider currently but so many people dont even know what it is. Most people who have heard of it know it from renaissance festivals which unfortunately tend to serve a lot of shit mead. It used to be the preferred drink of royalty but has since lost its place. Mead needs a place it needs to have its own little niche utility where people would rather have it than anything else. Perhaps it could be marketed as a gathering wine a wine to share with groups of friends and bring people together. Honestly I think youre already beginning to see it change. B. Nektar and other meaderies have started making mass produced short meads which are extremely drinkable and more importantly relatively affordable. Ken Schramm opened up his meadery just  years ago and has started producing some of the finest table meads in the world creating a small market for those who want an elegant and luxurious experience. Ive watched this own sub grow more than  larger than it was just a year ago. Its already happening mead is being exposed to the mass markets.

2937348,0,t3_2tsqe5,I happened across a bottle last night.  I really enjoy braggots so I had to get it. The snow is piling up outside and the timing seems fortuitous.  So I am riding out the evening enjoying a new braggot.Aroma has a hint of a buttery diacetyl note and more of a spicy cinnamon sort of nose.  Not much obvious notes of honey but the honey is becoming more obvious as it warms up.Appearance is medium caramel and minimal to moderate carbonationhead.  Taste is primarily about the ginger but it definitely seems balanced with what seems like cinnamon.  But it may just be the gingermalt boundary giving that impression. Kind of like a Belgian holiday spiced ale turned into a braggot.  Little or no hops or balanced so well as to be unnoticeable.  Spice on the tongue fading to sweetness which is likely the honey though it doesnt scream honey.  If it werent for the ginger itd remind me a bit of Brother Adams Honey Bragget Ale.Palate is light slick.  Not creamy or thick.Overall quite nice.  Not rated very highly on RB or BA surprisingly.   I am enjoying it very much.  Its somewhat sweet so you have to have a palate tolerant of that.  But the ginger does a lot to balance that  or the ginger adds to the apparent sweetness.  Will probably buy again on occasion given the chance but it was a bit pricey for frequent purchase.,mead,co1zmka,5,t5_2rcsz

Unless Im making a batch of my cyser older version linked in OPs post updated version here then I make like  gallons but there is a TON of solids so from my  gallons of primary I got a bigger primary bucket compared to the saved post I end up with like  gallons to go into secondary.  I crush my apples then pasteurize the crushed apples and honey mix no water added then toss that into the big primary bucket.  I got myself a  gallon stock pot that I fill like  of the way with crushed apples pasteurize to  degrees add like  pounds of honey then pour it into my primary bucket and start on the next pot.  I take NOTHING out I dont skim the solids out I dont skim the froth off just pasteurize it then mix the honey until its fully dissolved and pour into my bucket.

4652004,0,t3_3eopw2,With bread yeast you want to rack twice or you get big yeasty cakes at the bottom of your bottles. Theyre especially annoying because bread yeast doesnt flocculate well i.e. its super easy to stir it up and cloud your beautifully aged mead. If it were me Id rack to secondary let it clarify for a couple of months and then bottle it and age it another couple of months. They say you can drink JAOM at  months but Id triple that if possible. The difference is really really noticeable.The one really nice thing about bread yeast though is if you suddenly have to skip town you can leave that stuff sitting on the lees for a long time before any off flavors will take hold.

If you want to make a wild mead then his instructions for waiting to let one take over seem okay but Ive never done that. If youre just getting into it Id recommend you dont do that though.Try getting some Lalvin b in a packet from your local homebrew store or Amazon. It will turn out much better. Think of it as rolling a guaranteed  every time instead of rolling a d and hoping for a critical hit with wild yeast you might roll a  and have to throw it all out.Id recommend that as a start you go with the link in the sidebarand just scale it down from gal to gal if you dont wanna put that big of an investment into it. Easiest instructions I can think of?Throw lb Container of honey made runny by soaking container in warm water Handful of raisins or a Tsp of nutrient powder Enough water to get to one gallon A dry pack of Lalvin b just pour the granules in for nowAll into a carboy.

I now routinely add all the Fermaid O up front I do not use any Fermaid K or DAP and my yeast is rehydrated with GoFerm Protect.  I stir daily for at least the first week and by the end of week  my ferment is finished every time.  Putting the mead on a massive stir plate seemed to cut the time down by a day or two but had no other noticeable benefit.  Temperature control during the ferment is vastly more important than how you add your nutrients in my opinion.  Ive not heard that the two are somehow tied together though.

5691170,0,t1_cx2i7na,Balathustriuss calculator does have a default  ppm YAN built into the formula that is the must YAN before nutrient. I believe it is an alterable field as well. That being said I totally agree we should be measuring musts prior to nutrient additions to get a better view of what we are working with as a default figure isnt appropriate for all fermentations. Of course the complexity goes even further once you start evaluating individual strains wild cider yeast and bacteria cultures tend to have much lower N needs than traditional strains for instance. In a dream world Id love to have the calculator that takes into account all of these factors but there is a lot of experimentation that needs to be done yet.Regardless in the bigger picture I think there is a point that is good enough. For the hobbyist there is likely a point of diminishing returns when trying to calculate your nutrient amounts at some level as long as youre nutrifying youre probably hard pressed to find a discernible difference as so many exbeeriments have seemed to find similar null results!. For the pros and perfectionists out there I would love to see extended research actual LAB research and documented and repeatable experiments that paint a clearer picture.

All sourness comes from pedio which takes about  months to produce noticeable acidity at least.  Adding the maltodextrin is good to provide food for the pediobrett as they take a long time to work while sacch will take a week or two.

Some years ago he had a celtic wedding at a local celtic fair kind of a ren fair but centered on celtic culture as celts before Romans came were some of the first populations to live in the area we live in and one of the requirements for a full blown celtic wedding totally optional but very appreciated is for the groom to brew his own mead as an offer to the gods for luck and whatever. My friend being an all or nothing kind of guy decided to brew way more than what was required a litre. He brewed something like  liters of mead half Orange Blossom and half traditional. In two  liters demijohns in his cellar. The Orange Blossom demijohn exploded midfermentation. The idiot had forgot to vent it that day it was way before he learned of airlocks and other kind of caps and it went boom in the middle of the night. Neighbors called the police.

Obviously things are gonna cool down but you really need to nail that low s to start. You can also look in to rehydration nutrients like GoFerm. Normal nutrient is not a substitute. Also its possible your yeast is bad. Hows it been stored?Gravity will only drop from sugars being converted to alcohol by yeast. If the yeast youre using poop out at a gravity of . for example because theyve reached their alcohol tolerance only a strain with higher alcohol tolerance can take it lower. Also a minor critique pitch the entire pack. Its hard to over pitch and a full five grams is perfectly reasonable. The yeast are gonna divide many times over all the better to have a bigger initial colony. ,mead,d4aylk2,1,t5_2rcsz

Allow it to clear.. Add back the mead you split off right before bottling.. Bottle condition.First youre making an incorrect assumption that you need to use campden tablets to clear up the mead. They may help by reducing yeast activity but campden tablets arent primarily a clearing agent. Time will do that. Or finings.Second bottle carbonation of mead can be iffy depending on how much alcohol is present.

That however isnt the case for beer. Yes its a part of history but only because better practices werent discovered.

10960162,0,t3_5wj427,Was visiting family and my aunt told me how there was a Meadery not far from where they lived. Its Called Tugwell Creak Honey Farm amp Meadery. So I decided to go over with some others.Did a tasting of  of the available meads due to BCs wonderful liquor laws. The first two were both traditional one being a Melomel and the other a Methlegin. Both were quite good with the Melomel being quite dry.The last two were quite interesting being similar to port in that they go to a distiller just down the road to distill their meads. They then add this back in to make a fortified Mead. The first one which I didnt try was the more aged one which apparently tasted quite smooth. While the last one which I tried was basically a fortified version of the Melomel. This one wasnt aged as much making the alcohol more pronounced.After that we walked around the grounds got hissed at by the goose youll see in the album. There were also  cats only one of which I got a picture of. They also have sheep and chickens.One last thing the lady doing the tasting was the wife of the owner who had been keeping bees since he was  and has been making Mead for about  years. I think I remember her saying the Meadery has been open for  years making it the oldest Meadery in western Canada.If you have any more questions lets me know!,mead,deagom9,5,t5_2rcsz

11760918,0,t1_dgt4ait,It wont carbonate until after you bottle it as carbonation is caused by the co not having anywhere to go.  In a carboy it would just go out the airlock.  In alcoholic beverages after the sugar ferments out youd add a bit of sugar before bottling so the yeast has just enough to carbonate to your desired level. However in nonalcoholic mead thered be plenty of sugar so itll continue to carbonate until the container explodes which is why I recommended soda bottles they can handle much more pressure than glass bottles and venting them daily once carbed up.I suppose you could pasteurize.  I have no idea what should happen if you added potassium sorbate in something already carbonated.  It might gush or it might work.  Maybe someone else knows.  You could also pasteurize with heat but be very very careful.  Ive seen some posts about people doing this with sweetened cider and a few often explode.,mead,dgt4ogl,1,t5_2rcsz
