The instructor refuses to acknowledge that he was wrong on multiple occasions and will both say really inappropriate things yet also get offended when our class was joking amongst ourselves. He was very soft spoken and got angry when we started to doze off during his   hour lectures which consisted of reading a powerpoint presentationIts not even that the class was difficult or anything the instructor just suckedToo bad I have him again this semester for another course,BCIT,coek8yv,2,t5_2s6an

Youll be needing Windows for sure for what youre gonna be doing but if you already have a MacBook you might as well dualboot it to save some money in comparison to buying a new laptop. You dont need super highend specs unless youll be playing League during lecture which you shouldnt be doing anyways.,BCIT,cpmibfe,2,t5_2s6an

4250913,0,t3_39m7nb,I just finished the year degree option so can give you a bit of insight. I worked part time during the first year mostly out of necessity. It was tough but doable. Maybe  hours a week tops. Second year? Forget about it. In fact i would start researching how to extend days to be about  hours. Im sure its possible with magnets or something...The program is split into  sets usually some classes lectures will be combined some will be just your set. Usually sets will be  or so students. You wont have any issues finding summer employment. Youll likely start off in the hr range and go up from there. Depends a lot on where you work too. The program is pretty male dominant but each year has a few females in it. Best suggestion is to not try and tackle everything on your own. Get a group of likeminded individuals together and study work in groups etc.  it is much easier when you can bounce ideas off each other. Hope that helps!,BCIT,cs4sj9w,3,t5_2s6an

6956851,0,t3_4aw6qs,java is the most important course in the first term. Math is easy enough that you can learn it as you go at least first term math is. HTML class is pretty easy over all. Only gets a little annoying at the end but nothing serious.   Thats the main stuff you have to worry about. everything else is easy or annoying. Term two is the start of tough times.  Just learn java and build shit build as much shit as you can.,BCIT,d14w5mt,2,t5_2s6an

Im in sonography and there are  or  x ray grads in my class alone because there are no jobs for xray. There is more in the class below me as well even students that graduated the year before from radiography.  ,BCIT,d29bzfm,1,t5_2s6an
7372824,0,t3_4gbraw,Man last years or maybe  years ago BCIT SA elections were a joke. They had people with ipads running around making it super easy for someone to vote. I think they were actually partnered with a candidate and were actively trying to get herhim votes.The little platform paragraph was just like this one too. Vague and seemingly the same as the current VPs platform who by the way I dont know. Who is the current VP and what has he done for campus life?Here Ill make my own platform paragraphgt If elected as VP Campus Life I Tetracova will work with in tandem with the facility and student body to have frequent highquality events like farmers markets barbeques parties and music shows. I will ensure our recreational facilities are as safe and fun as possible including a resurfaced track longer gym hours and new team and group sports like ultimate and cricket. Finally Ill make sure a designated secured safe sleeping facility is created for the rare emergency overnight study sessions.gt gt Vote Tetracova for a better campus life!,BCIT,d2g8mch,7,t5_2s6an

8654001,0,t3_4yapqo,I just finished first year in that program and am going into second. Its pretty tough honestly...the  course per term workload isnt easy. If youve taken any business courses before first year shouldnt be too bad its mostly general business courses and only two insurance courses. Keep on top of your work and get used to working in teams as there will be tons of team projects. I am currently working for an insurance company for the summer and had no trouble finding summer jobs. I chose the program because I had an interest in working in risk management and because BCIT had a good reputation. Employers are really keen to hire from this program so if you want to get into insurance id say its your best bet. Just be wary if you fail two courses in a term or any of the insurance courses you will be kicked out of the program. Previous years have lost more than  of the program between the first and second years.Overall I think its great! Just be prepared to work your butt off.,BCIT,d6nd4qx,1,t5_2s6an

11307284,0,t3_61ct9d,Speaking from personal experienceI went to the BCIT Burnaby campus in January of  and inquired about the CISA program. They told me that acceptance guidelines are a bit strict and that they follow a few metrics that are not typical. E.g. When you write about yourself in the application they consider your motivations for applying. They also assured me that I would be on a  year waiting list.I applied in JanFeb  anyway with the expectation that I would be on a waiting list. Come the first week of August I got a call from Randy the head instructor and he said in so many words I extend to you an invitation to the program and if you accept right now and can get your shit together student loans etc before start of classes September th you can consider yourself a student of CISA.So I did just that and I am now currently a student in the CISA program. Now I will say that YMWV. I applied and got in the same year but I also came across some people in the program who waited for over a year or more.Im a mature student which is to say that I am . I have a broad work background and my motivation for being in the course is strong. I have a desire to be successful and I expressed as much in my application. I feel that this helped distinguish my application.If you are already on the list then thats great! You are essentially accepted. I honestly dont know the process but I would imagine it goes something like this BCIT accepts  students three cohorts of  that they consider to be ideal applicants and some of those students are failouts from the year prior who want to give it a second go. Then about a month before start of classes  students dont confirm. Then the call goes out to the waiting list. The waiting list is not firstcomefirstserve though. Its a list of desirables. You are somewhere on that list but who knows what the criterion is. So the school then fills the roster with people from that waiting list. Then classes start. During the first  weeks about  peoplecohort will drop out. They cant hack it or they find thats its not for them. Whatever. The school then calls people on the list again to fill the roster. After that point though no one else can join. Its mostly because any student that joins past that point will be too far behind in the curriculum.Basically my advice to you is that if you are truly interested in the program there is no reason to not apply. Since you are already accepted its just a waiting game. Its also pretty easy to calculate. If you dont get the call in September you wont get it until next September. There is only one intakeyear.So best of luck to you and start to learn the material in the interim.,BCIT,dfdnwfw,2,t5_2s6an
