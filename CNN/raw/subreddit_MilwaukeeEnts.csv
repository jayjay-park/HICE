911060,0,t3_24jodu,Welcome to the city. There are a few places Ill lead you to but they will require a certain amount of chill and or cool to get you what youre looking for. Theres a street called Brady Street thats half way from the east side to downtown. Its one of the coolest streets in the city and was a breeding ground for the counter culture back in the day. Any one of the bars on the street will have someone who smokes. One in particular called the Nomad. Go out some night get a little tipsy start talking to people who look like stoners because lets face it they probably are. Once they know they can trust you which wouldnt take long depending on how chill you come off lol. Outside of meeting someone from Reddit or myself this is the best option. ,MilwaukeeEnts,ch7udis,3,t5_2tf26
