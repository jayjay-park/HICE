10728860,0,t1_ddm9st2,I believe purposeful satirical news outlets exist like the Onion of course. What I dont believe is fakenews. Why? Because too many times the media has said one thing and then some time passes and it comes out to be the exact opposite AND the news media knew it was false from the getgo. Or it is crazy to me what passes as journalism nowadays. Journalism is the reporting of factsdetails of an event that occurred. Not once should the authors feelings or conjecture be known. What is clearly opinion is on the front page of CNN NYT and most of the  hour networks. Prime time isnt reserved for facts but rather fear mongeringdiminishing. The world is a rather large place. There are real things like civil wars happening  hours a day. Our mapglobe has CHANGED and what do I see on CNN? Info about cat shows or a planegirl that went missing months ago.  Dude there are two Somalias now! Along with two libyas two Sudans Turkish prime minister rounded up every lawyer and Judge in a weekend without due process and threw them in jail FARC has declared peace after a  year war.... this is just top of the iceberg. No one channel has covered these major events or even gave them the global changing attention they deserve South Koreas president was making her decisions based on a cult leaders advice and the group of Eight Goddesess.?! . All are guilty. So none of them can ever condemn another for being fakenews but they still try. That is what I meant. That and how is anything really fake? Maybe the powers that be just dont want the populace to know?  CIA coverups such as MKUltra Heart attack guns distributing Crack cocaine to black neighborhoods selling guns to Iran were all immediately denied and the journalists discredited and barred from their profession. Fast forward and through declassifications or collossal screw ups and it turns out all of the above were true along with much more AND the entire Congress knew.Get what I mean now?,NotMyJob,ddmlob3,2,t5_2y1ei

Fixing this would require relocating the driveway.  Which would require relocating the garage.Now a well connected developer might be able to convince the AHJpublic works department to move the hydrant and tear out and repour the brand new curb but I doubt it.

10990056,0,t1_dedn53v,I take advantage while at work. I bust my ass for  to  minutes every hour slack off for the remainder of the hour. Some days like today i have a little more time. Some days like Thursday the end of my work week i eat lunch on the go. Only because i feel that if i dont finish my work before the weekend i failed. Failed myself not my supervisor not the owner of the company nor my co workers. Maybe if i planned to live out my working days with this company i would slow down and do a fair days pay for a fair days work. But for now i will keep doing what im doing just to keep myself happy with my performance. ,NotMyJob,dedos4w,2,t5_2y1ei

Meaning you change the meaning of it to refer to the whole previous statement instead of the original subject state of the application?
