5354797,0,t1_cvw4gxy,Not that Im aware of you can hold the dumbbell either horizontal or vertical to target the certain muscle groups.  There is variations on the front raise that involves no trying to lock your arm straight but that forces it into more of a curl. ,GYM,cvw4wel,1,t5_2qizo
5769319,0,t1_cxc7cz7,Tried it out. Pretty good amount of focus obviously but crashed hard  a few hours after taking. Most pres i take have mg and i dont really get any other source of caffeine in my daily intake. ,GYM,cxc8k4z,2,t5_2qizo
9251284,0,t1_d8ilif2,yeah I know that but the drink i mentioned contains caffeine ,GYM,d8oo12b,1,t5_2qizo
9626209,0,t1_d9wqwdy,Ok maybe try to increase you protein intake alot look into some vegetarian protein shakes if not taking any at the moment. Dont do cardio everyday cut it to  times you go and keep it last like you have been doing. In regards to weights reps and sets try do x on bench for a few weeks. This is strength training and needs to be done with a higher weight obviously. it should be a struggle to get those last few reps out in you last couple sets. Do this style for all your main lifts on each day. Are you doing legs? Squats? Deadlifts? ,GYM,d9zmmx4,1,t5_2qizo
10366762,0,t3_5ofodf,I like the blog intro you did at the beginning.  I liked the workout session maybe put sub titles as to what your doing in each one so people undertsnd your full body workout. I should do some blog type stuff for my own channel i currently mainly do informative weird stuff i guess. Check me out as well if you dont mind.  and give me some feed back as well if you dont mind. ,GYM,dcj4v0p,2,t5_2qizo

11196482,0,t1_df0pma9,Added a link to the posy or copy paste this.And this applies to anaerobic exercise aka all gym motions because it is already hard to get enough oxygen for these fast bursts of strength. Breathing while lifting will lessen the oxygen deficit that you create by doing these anerobic motions. This video is just as an awareness for people who dont breathe enough during gym exercises.,GYM,df13w1f,1,t5_2qizo
11413710,0,t1_dfpq0oz,Those are both two different ways you can use it. One is like a full body movement while the other youre just using your legs if I read what you said correctly.Generally the standard way of using the elliptical is to bounce because you are simulating running.,GYM,dfpqect,1,t5_2qizo
11471597,0,t3_63qr9z,Re rack your weights when youre done with them. Clean off equipment when youre done with it. Dont interrupt someone in the middle of a set. People will probably only critique you if youre doing something that you might injure yourself doing like squatting or deadlifting with bad form. ,GYM,dfwatdz,3,t5_2qizo
