5886,0,t3_1u6ypa,I think the main dynamic on which weapon a follower uses is the base damage. Thats the damage without smithing enchantments etc. You would think it would be smarter than that but it isnt and theyll even use weapons with a higher base damage over a weapon they have skill with which would produce better damage.Thats one of the reasons theyll equip a glass sword with no improvements or enchantments over an epic steel sword with dual enchantments.Pretty much all you can do is just give them the items you want them to use and have them carry nonweapons.,skyrim,cef3uyc,2,t5_2s837

9800,0,t3_1u6dbw,Delgar Litte. Redguard. Born to a pirate and a sailor whom he raped Delgar was raised on the ships and the seas. He killed his first man at eleven and the rest of the pirates lifestyle soon followed. He became ruthless and a true cutthroat pirate. His father was killed by an entire Imperial militia a massive force of over eighty men. Less than twenty made it back. Those twenty had the crew of the Firebird to deal with. Delgar led the slaughter and after that night he led the crew. The crew prospered under Delgar and lasted nine years before the Empire turned their attention on the Firebird. A quarter of the Empirical army against the fiercest pirate ship ever to sail. Eighteen ships capsized at the hands of the Firebird. Seriously outmanned Delgar capsized the boat. He managed to get all of the men and most of the gold off and led his men ashore. There they formed a bandits camp biding time until they could buy a new ship. They were hired by Ulfric to protect his men and they did just that. When the Imperials showed up some of the men bailed and Delgar sent the rest back to the camp he would finish this alone. He twisted his fathers swords around cutting down Imperials and Stormcloaks alike. Eventually the Imperials knocked him down and captured him taking his fathers sword Windshear and arrested him. He was sent to Helgen. He didnt stay too long. Now hes on a quest get back his fathers sword find his crew take out some rival operations and make a ton of gold doing it.,skyrim,cefjugr,1,t5_2s837

21722,0,t3_1uda5a,Magic is tough at first then suddenly gets awesome. In destruction you want to get the Impact perk ASAP. Work on weak creatures at first or use a sword or shield in one hand. Just go to those when your magic is low.Conjuration has some benefits. Summoning an atronach like the Flame Atronach helps in combat and can keep enemies distracted. The bow and sword you can conjure are pretty cool and are very powerful in the beginning. The bow is twohanded but the sword is onehanded so you can wield a spell or shield in the other.Fast Healing is better than Healing. On the Restoration tree you want to get the perk that makes your magicka regen faster and the one that does extra healing. The wards kind of suck.A lot of mage players will use heavy armor with some magicka regen and spell school cost reduction Destruction spells cost  less etc.. That way they can take armed combat hits pretty well.Its only at higher levels  Id say over  maybe as high as   that you can start to feel potent. I think i usually start magic after level  but Ive only once played a pure mage.,skyrim,cegwmx8,2,t5_2s837

26230,0,t3_1udutt,My hero was Thanan My first name is nathan Drago the nord hero who helped Martin Septim close the gates of oblivion. After many adventures and conquest in Cyrodill the hero of Bruma retired in Anvil taking residence inside the Brenuin Manor. After defeating a powerful lich that haunted the house he descovered the Tome of Undeath a powerful book revealing the secrets of ageless life. Using his friends in the mages guild he perfected the spell and spent his endless days an aristocrat languishing in both wealth and wine.But his warrior spirit was restless he longed for the days when was a ronin traveling through the land smiting evil at the tip of his ebony longsword. His passion was rekindled upon the news that the Aldmeri Dominion had ransacked Bruma and destroyed the statue proclaiming his valor. My Lord suited up and raced to fight the enemy whom was currently attacking the neighboring kingdom of Chorrol. Many of the Thalmor fell before Drago his instinctive hatred of high elves only strengthening his fury.  My lord was indomitable in battle but the elves were too numerous and the city fell. His pride only led to his ruin. His haste to fight the enemy in Chorrol left his home of Anvils open to the Dominion. The elves burned the city and destroyed his manor in their quest to vanquish any trace of the champion of Cyrodill that so resembled mighty Talos. My lord was now a destitute. All his companions and allies were dead either through battle or the grasp of death that my lord now regretfully alluded. His only choice was to flee Cyrodill so he could fight the Thalmor when was ready. He fled to Hammerfell finding what work he could all records of his legacy being destroyed. It wasnt long before he regained wealth and status and found a home in the city of Taneth. But his fame only attracted the eye of the Thalmor who came to kill him once again. Thanan would have defeated them but a traitorous redgaurd noble woman gave the city to the elves and their insurmountable numbers caused my lord to retreat once more. After many years of hiding Thanan chose to return to his home of Skyrim. It was at the border that my lord lost all memory of himself caught in  an ambush in between his Imperial ties and his fellow nordic kinsmen. A steel greathammer struck him unprepared and my lords unconcious body was thrown in with the other nord warriors to be executed. But the Gods it seems had other plans.I guess you can tell Im a fan of Conan the Barbarian.,skyrim,cehf318,1,t5_2s837

Just sneaking through dungeons and picking every door and chest you find will get you tons of points especially with the thief stone. Pickpocketing you can get up really fast by stealing expensive jewelry from rich people.Unfortunately using a greatsword for assassinations will make you detected easier compared to if you used a dagger or h weapon but thats half the fun right? AFAIK only swinging the weapon makes noise sheathing it or carrying it shouldnt affect your detection.,skyrim,cepkckw,1,t5_2s837

103422,0,t1_ceq587o,I played as a puremage Altmer. Theyre pretty squishy early on and for a very long time but at high levels theyre ridiculously badass and nighon unstoppable Highborn is a pretty OP racial power. Basically here are some of the things that helped me survive my playthrough if youre interested Destruction. Selfexplanatory. This will be your main form of combat so level it up as quickly as possible then nuke your enemies into the th circle of Oblivion. Restoration. Also selfexplanatory. Adept restoration is really only what you need since then you can cast those instaheal spells instead of the slowass healthpersecond ones and the really good wards helps a lot against dragons. Spec into Regeneration healing cures  more Recovery Magicka regenerates  faster and Avoid Death once a day autoheals  points when you fall below  health. Remember being a badass mage who can cast magical nukes is cool but dying in the process is not. Lydia. Any warrior follower will do I use Durak from the Dawnguard expansion because his level isnt capped but Lydia is good because you get her very early on in the game. Basically clad your follower in heavy armour and use them as a meat shield. Youre a mage who has spent ages training and mastering the mystic arts. Let the uneducated barbarians do the dirty work for you  Conjuration. Really atronachs are pretty useless and are only needed to distract your enemies. Level it up behind the scenes until you can conjure Dremora Lords. THATS when the fun begins. Alteration. Youre too fucking tough for armour you wear silks and robes and frills! First things first  armour spells. I am not kidding these spells will save your arse in combat. Level up your Alteration until you can cast Expert or Master level spells for only half magicka then get either Ebonyflesh or Dragonflesh. Next spec into Mage Armour gives double armour rating when not using actual armour Magical Resistance  magic resistance and maybe Stability armour spells last longer. Now you can get all the benefits of armour without covering up your lovely silk robes. SneakIllusion. Remember you are squishy. Best stay out of direct combat if you can help it. Level up your sneak like you normally would perks are optional and for illusion level up until you can get the Quiet Casting perk all spells are silent to others. If you want level up to Expert so you can cast Invisibility and Muffle. Theres nothing more embarrassing to an enemy than being sneakattacked with a fireball to the face.So there thats my handy guide to surviving in Skyrim as a puremage. Hope this helped ,skyrim,ceq7f8n,7,t5_2s837

For example the type of clothing you wear will have an impact on your cold exposure. If youre naked you will most likely freeze to death. But if youre wearing something that provides more coverage it decreases your exposure to the cold. Fur type armor and cloaks provide better resistance. Theres way more features Frostfall has to offer like the ability to warm yourself in any fire or heat source or you can build your own campfire.

The vanilla game doesnt even come close to being a full and finished game. It couldve been so much better.

359053,0,t1_cfhvwya,MSI Afterburner is awesome and free.  Very little overhead lets you configure a good number of settings to adjust compression etc.  more compression more overhead.  See this video of me doing random crap just loaded a save and did this to demo Afterburner.  Its an overclocking program for MSI videocards but theres an option for video capture in the settings like the th tab and you can set a hotkey to begin recording.  It doesnt have any ugly watermarks and the quality is good only thing it adds to the video is a small circle of spinning dots in the corner to indicate its recording.Note the quality is poor for a while just uploaded and its still processing so its only P.Edit Looks like the quality is still meh.  Not sure why it looks almost as good as ingame on my PC with the original files.  Im not very good at the YouTubes...  Are there compression settings or something I need to adjust?

I sided with the storm cloaks this time and I enjoy their quests more and this being my first hardcore Nord run as well kinda adds to the case for the storm cloaks. Also Ulfric is kinda awesome as an NPC too. Plus i fucking hate high elves so i can be cool with the storm cloaks disliking them too.

461896,0,t3_1zd700,I personally use the regular SFO LOD files and the new ENBs setting for LOD that really makes a difference in reduce the eye sore.Change the following in enblocal.ini    ENGINE    ForceLodBiastrue    LodBias.Usually have to do a bit of tweaking afterwards but its a pretty big change for this kind of stuff. Didnt notice a very large performance hit either. Comparison Gif Raw Comparison ScreenshotsEdit  A brief explanationThe reason this happens is that Skyrim specifically limits the number of fully rendered trees to maintain performance default . You can change the number in SkyrimPref.ini for the property uiMaxSkinnedTreesToRender but the performance hit for going past  is fairly significant with higher end machines set around  for screen archery. The LOD models are usually low polycount with x or x textures arent meant to do anything but provide a backdrop. With vanilla Skyrim it wasnt as noticeable but with the advent of very well done HD and compressed pseudoHD texture mods they have become and eyesore.,skyrim,cfsrnvg,2,t5_2s837

564951,0,t1_cg4h6kh,Yep. The Dunmer are very well known for their slavery. The Altmer take part in slavery also though they call their slaves servants as it is a privilege to be serving such a godly race. Also I point out that most races are racist in some way or another because due to war most of the races dont trust each other. Kahjiit and Argonians of course dont like the Dunmer but they also despise each other. Imperials are basically more militaristic Nords. Redguards are not related to any of the races in Tamriel and initially their goal was to take Tamriel for themselves and due to a falling out with the Imperials do not trust neither imperials or elves. Orcs and Breton have disliked each other for ages as the Breton do not like the orcs settling in their land. Orcs are also not well liked amongst most races due to their looks and aggressive behavior though they are well liked amongst imperials for their combat skills. Bosmer are probably the least racist in my opinion as they prefer to stay out of all current affairs but that also leads to them preferring the company of other Bosmer and due to their elf nature still see themselves as being greater then human races though they dont act on it.,skyrim,cg4ho76,2,t5_2s837

Its really fun as a lot more fun side quests and has a lot of content in it then Dawnguard which only has  main quest and a lot less exciting side quests.,skyrim,cggu349,3,t5_2s837

736278,0,t3_22lgg9,The thing is that the Stormcloaks are essentially fighting for the same things the Empire is. The Empire just wants to take less risks and play the waiting game saving up their strength to fight the Dominion when ready.The Stormcloaks are more emotional and want freedom from the Dominion now. This presents a problem as the Stormcloaks need to rid themselves of the Empire in order to fight the Dominion but that is a war that weakens both sides giving the Dominion the upper hand.So when people bash the Stormcloaks theyre most often supporting the idea that the humans and beastfolk need strength through unity more than anything giving a better chance of religious freedom later.And also they probably see Ulfric as an opportunist. He may care about the cause but mostly they may think he just used the ban on Talos to start the rebellion a war where he can further his own ambitions of nobility. ,skyrim,cgnyvlv,11,t5_2s837
737535,0,t3_22lwbc,These can all be woven into a roleplaying narrative pretty much any way you like. However there are some practical concerns that might affect your decisions here.Dragonborn only becomes available after you have completed received the main storyline quest The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. Miraaks cultists will begin to randomly attack you in cities after that point. Youll find a note on one of them that starts the Dragonborn questline. Some folks report having a LOT of difficulty with Dragonborn at early levels so youd probably want to be level  or so before focusing on Dragonborn. Depends a lot on your Difficulty setting I suspect. If youre on Legendary you might want to wait even longer.Dawnguard only becomes available at level . Guards will mention it and a courier may give you a note. More importantly vampires and their minions will begin to randomly attack you in cities after that point until you address the vampire problem. These random attacks can be very deadly for both you and various important townspeople outdoor merchants trainers etc. so its best to deal with the situation fairly early. Many people play this one when their level is in the teens even on Legendary.As for the main questline the primary concern is when the dragons start appearing. After you kill the first dragon for the Jarl of Whiterun you can encounter dragons as random encounters. After visiting High Hrothgar and getting Whirlwind Sprint you will encounter dragons even more frequently and this will be the case until the end of the main story line. If you were playing on Legendary for example you might want to delay all that a bit to better establish your character before the real fun starts.As for the Civil War joining either side means you cannot enter the opposing factions war camps for trading and you can  be randomly attacked by the other side as you travel. Also apparently capturing towns as part of the Civil War quests can break some other quests.  Probably best to leave this until at least level  or so.Dark Brotherhood questline can be played at any time. If youve done some adventuring in Solstheim and are a member of the Dark Brotherhood members of the Morag Tong can attack you as random encounters. But by that point you should be able to handle it.,skyrim,cgo41an,4,t5_2s837

763951,0,t1_cgr3yqf,Ill give you a basic rundown then  Might be some inaccuracies and is just a short generalization.Talos is one of the Nine Divines a pantheon of gods. He wasnt always though. He was first Tiber Septim a great general and Nord hero. Through a combination of skill strength cunning and luck he founded what we know today as the Empire. Not the first Empire btw His bloodline ended  years ago during the Oblivion Crisis TES IV and the Empire was shaken to its core by the event. Anyway the god Akatosh saw him as a great spirit and worked to convince his  cohorts to raise him to godhood which truly happened.Now the High Elves known as the Thalmor from the Summerset Isles in the southwest corner of the continent saw their chance to seize power againish and declared war on the weakened Empire. It was a long and bloody conflict and it has currently plateaud at a stalemate with the signing of the WhiteGold Concordat which states that Talos is not a Divine and that worship of Talos is outlawed across all of the territories the Empire holds. They demanded this because they find the thought of a human becoming a Divine to be an affront to their origins as the first race of either Men or Mer on the planet Nirn.This has obviously pissed a lot of people off more specifically the Nords whos heritage has been cast aside by the Empire who owes its very founding to the Ninth Divine.So anyone who tells you Talos is not truly a god is an uneducated fool brainwashed by the crumbling remains of the Empire and subsequently those filthy elves the Thalmor.,skyrim,cgr480x,3,t5_2s837

Bethesda looked at WoW and saw it rake in money but started throwing its own money into it before they saw Old Republic flop and DCOU go FP and all the other imitators that didnt have the innovation or implementation of Blizzards game.

Move around the world building up a network of sympathetic guards who youll know you can rely on in the future by baiting them with obvious crimes and seeing if theyre receptive to payoffs.Alternatively take up a craft and sell whatever you make to shop keepers. The more you sell for the more speech EXP you get and you still get the EXP even if theyve run out of gold. Having things like the Masque of Calvicus Vile and other items that boost your selling power will get you more gold and more EXP.If you have Hearthfire then water breathing potions made with salmon roe are worth  gold with no perks whatsoever. Taking alchemy and speech perks as you go you should be able to reach  in alchemy and  in speech in no time because your potions will be worth  each. Thats crazy fast EXP.A career thief may have use of certain potions and poisons so this may be a way to raise your skills within the RP.You could also choose to enchant weapons and armour and sell them. Even basic iron daggers which anyone can make with no smithing experience can be sold for a lot of gold when you have the right highvalue enchantment.

The only thing that is implied by any of these games is that your character fulfills the main quest not any of the factions.

Its been my favorite so far actually. Last time I did a god mode playthrough with a mage and found all the overpowered mods weapons armors etc I could and just wreaked total havoc that was fun. Before that I did a crafter playthrough where I only allowed myself to level up blacksmithing enchanting alchemy and onehanded. That one was kinda tough didnt really play it long as long. Occasionally I do a silly character and install a bunch of ridiculous mods and just play around.

When I fast travel around chasing quest markers I get bored.  Im suggesting you might be bored because fast traveling to chase quest markers around is actually a pretty boring thing to do. If youre anything like me you might have more fun ignoring quests entirely and just exploring.  Or even make your own quests Find Out the Secret of the Random Cave Over There.Theres a lot of random encounters and somewhat hidden locations that make the game more fun  but you dont see as many if you fast travel.  If you got all those quests done by level  then youre obviously rushing through the game.  Slow down and enjoy yourself.,skyrim,ch63zh3,2,t5_2s837

He ran away with his wooden bow and bought arrows from passing by traders. He killed wandering animals cooked them and ate them. He slept in one of the famously large trees in one of Valenwoods famously large forests. He repeated this every day until once he saw a moth priest wandering the forest. He was confused and approached him the moth priest told him of his destiny and that he needs to travel to Skyrim. Etsmi wasnt sure why but he felt like he needed to do this. Just before crossing the border into Cyrodil he passed a stable he stole a horse and rode away as the owner screamed at him. After a long trip he arrived in Skyrim just afer crossing into Skyrim he saw some imperial soldiers chasing a man named Ralof Ulfric Stormcloak himself and some other stormcloak soldiers.

1025284,0,t1_chkt0qh,If you know nothing about PC gaming Ill give you some information you need to know thats not particularly related to skyrim.  Tldrs in bold.  Skip the first  if you know the stuff Im blabbering about.  Well note that whatever youre getting on a laptop no matter how powerful the hardware will always be at best  to  years behind in terms of power and processing capability to a desktop built with selected parts And Im not talking desktops you purchase from retail stores for the same price.  In essence know that your laptop while quite powerful and likely a huge step up from what you have had before will still occasionally struggle when a PC wouldnt so youre paying for less longevity and overall performance for portability.  Mind you your laptop is vastly more powerful than mine being two full generations ahead and two models up from all my specs in terms of the processor and video card ETC so itll last a while and mines still going strong after . years!  Im able to play most games at alright settings provided the games are properly optimized.  Be sure to update your Nvidia GPUs driver every so often in order to get performance boosts.  After you set your laptop up for maximum performance update your drivers to the current up to date version ASAP.  Dont mix up laptop GPU cards with Desktop cards.  I have an Nvidia M.  That does not make it anywhere near in power to a  series desktop card.  Your M while powerful for a laptop is not a GTX  graphics card.  For laptops these cards are quite exceptional for what they can provide.  To give you a sense of how well you can run skyrim with a few tweaks and changes to the options settings I can run the game at high quality  FPS consistently with a bunch of nongraphics mods and a few personal tweaks. Your computer is more than capable of playing skyrim fine.  To answer your question depending on the mods your laptop should be able to run them fine.  Obviously small things like adding new items or mechanic overhauls wont affect performance.  They may cause errors conflicts in the code that could crash your game and perhaps bug down your CPU for a moment if it changes a bunch but they normally shouldnt if you find the right ones and load them properly. In essence any computer that can run skyrim fine will be able to run all sorts of these of mods.  By immersion mods I assume gameplay mechanics for a better game experience?  Youll be fine.  Those are mostly just number crunching calculations for the CPU which they chew up easily.  Graphics modifications will affect your performance depending on what you do.  Some ENBs are utterly amazing and can tank even desktop framerates while others may not at all.  Combined with heavy foliage mods grass leaves etc they can hurt the framerate quite a bit. Your laptop is powerful so I think you can manage maybe a few specific ENBs but you will almost certainly suffer a performance loss.  ,skyrim,chktxof,1,t5_2s837
1025708,0,t3_25uh3t,Theyre not warring against High Elves. Theyre against the Thalmor which is a mainly but not exclusively or allinclusively Altmer faction. You can see the occasional High Elf around Skyrim who has nothing to do with the Thalmor like the chick from the Mages Guild the robe vendor in Solitude or the advisor of the jarl of some hold I cant remember and the Nords dont seem to be particularly opposed to them.Think of it like being a Russian in the USA  sure if youre Putin or a highranking official expect some dirty eyes and maybe even a confrontation but otherwise people are generally smart enough to figure out not every single Russian is directly responsible for what their country does.,skyrim,chkvo5s,9,t5_2s837

1044832,0,t1_chlmj7c,I agree up to a point. I think that women who are not privileged enough to have a voice and the leisure time to consume this form of media definitely have bigger problems. But the representation of women in the media is also a problem for other groups of women.That being said I dont think this particular armor is offensive or degrading. Many other commenters in this thread have pointed out very reasonable claims as to why this armor is so skimpy i.e. theyre making do with what they have the male armor is equally skimpy etc.. The biggest tenet of feminism as I understand it is the personal is political and so what appears in a video game is not only a matter of leisure time but a political issue as well. Tamriel is not a world that is completely separate from ours. People who live in this world influenced that world. It makes sense then that our own values would be applied to this fictional world too.Critiquing this doesnt mean that we cant consume this media or other media. That wouldnt be very fun at all would it? But critiquing it is necessary to improving media we consume so that these issues become nonissues. As far as TES goes I think its very egalitarian and a lot better than other video game worlds. However everything is available for critique even things that are not overtly problematic.Okay Im rambling now. I love it when I get a chance to talk about two of my favorite things vjdya and feminism. ,skyrim,chn1vvl,2,t5_2s837

I think it adds a whole new layer to the game and can really transform it into something new and wonderful. Even beyond graphic mods there are plenty of gameplay mods that revamp the experience.That being said...I put over  hours into vanilla Skyrim and the fact is so did almost every other modder. Skyrim as a standalone is a phenomal game and to say the game is crap without mods is blasphemous in my opinion. Most people dont start modding until they have done everything vanilla like  times over...they wouldnt have started modding if they werent already addicted to playing the game.

Over time as monsters and other violent outsiders raid and loot the fair people of Britannia the money supply shrinks as coin is drained out into the hordes of these creatures. The economy gets a stimulus every time the Avatar shows up to liberate these piles and spends that money back into the economy.Perhaps the economy of Tamriel goes through a similar process with its monsters and heroes.Note this poster doesnt actually believe in the longterm efficacy of economic stimulus.,skyrim,ci1jzbn,5,t5_2s837

They were once either High Elves or Wood Elves but after the Malacath incedent they turned into an almost beast like Mer race known as Orsimer or Orcs. As said Oricalcum and orcish weapons are NOT the primary material Orcs smith with. Orcs mainly use Steel and Iron as they are far more common and are very strong. Oricalcum is a heavy much rarer metal that takes a very experienced smith to make. The reason Oricalcum weapons are commonly refered to as Orc weapons is because the Smiths of the Wrathgorian and Dragontail mountains where second to the dwarves in their smithing capabilities. Since Oricalcum was a very common resource high in the Orcish mountains these Smtihs almost all of which where Orcs started smithing and occasionally trading these green weapons to the rest of Tamriel. The reason we only see the Orc made varient of Oricalcum weapons and we dont see other versions is because of gameplay mechanics. It would cost time and money for the devs to make many varient of the same weapon class steel iron orcish dwarven with different skins. ,skyrim,cif3kl9,1,t5_2s837

1388890,0,t1_ciqdc2q,LOL it says pretty much what I did.Epilogue Hammerfell Fights On Alone Hammerfell however refused to accept the WhiteGold Concordat being unwilling to concede defeat and the loss of so much of their territory. Titus II was forced to officially renounce Hammerfell as an Imperial province in order to preserve the hardwon peace treaty. The Redguards understandably looked on this as a betrayal. In this the Thalmor certainly achieved one of their longterm goals by sowing lasting bitterness between Hammerfell and the Empire. In the end the heroic Redguards fought the Aldmeri Dominion to a standstill although the war lasted for five more years and left southern Hammerfell devastated. The Redguards say that this proves that the WhiteGold Concordat was unnecessary and that if Titus II had kept his nerve the Aldmeri could have been truly defeated by the combined forces of Hammerfell and the rest of the Empire. The truth of that assertion can of course never be known. But the Redguards should not forget the great sacrifice of Imperial blood  Breton Nord and Cyrodilic  at the Battle of the Red Ring that weakened the Dominion enough to allow the eventual Second Treaty of Stros Mkai in E  and the withdrawal of Aldmeri forces from Hammerfell. There can be no doubt that the current peace cannot last forever. The Thalmor take the long view as is proved by the sequence of events leading up to the Great War. All those who value freedom over tyranny can only hope that before it is too late Hammerfell and the Empire will be reconciled and stand united against the Thalmor threat. Otherwise any hope to stem the tide of Thalmor rule over all of Tamriel is dimmed.Be sure to read the last paragraph which sums up my point. The Aldmeri were willing to pullout and let hammerfell go if only to sow seeds of hatred between them and the Empire. ,skyrim,ciqdnr0,1,t5_2s837

1444911,0,t3_2ap6wu,For the most part the game is pretty forgiving of mistakes.  You shouldnt really need to respec for the most part because the only gameplayaffecting decision you make at character creation is your race and even that isnt crucial you can do any class with any race the racial bonuses to skills will only make a difference for the first few levels.  Most character decisions are made only when you level up and only one at a time so if you take the wrong perk at level  then you can just take the right one at level .Also the game itself provides a few ways to respec a little bit.  I think one comes with the Dragonborn DLC spending dragon souls to unassign perks and the other making skills legendary is part of the base game.As far as mods go I would start playing a little bit before you start modding.  That way youll know what you want to change before you change it.  The one exception is that youll almost certainly want to get SkyUI and maybe the unofficial patches.  Google gopher modding tutorial for some videos to get you started.

Depending on how long the thralls were able to stick around for theyd probably wind up with some overcrowding issues though lol. I wonder how theyd deal with housing for all their undead buddies.

Ive brewed mead several times and beer once but I used a beer kit to brew it.Brewing mead is as easy as throwing water honey and yeast into a barrel and waiting for it to start bubbling and then stop bubbling.The hard part which is still a relatively easy task is filtering out all the yeast.Mead does contrary to popular belief NOT resemble beer at all. Its more of a white wine but sweeter and honeyer. Its alcoholic volume is the same.When people say that mead is kind of like beer they are actually thinking of melomel metheglin which is a weaker mead with a bunch of hops added to it which gives it a beery resemblance.,skyrim,cj8ghr2,12,t5_2s837

The Nerevarine was also infected with Corpus so heshe has among other things above normal strength and endurance and is immortal. Heshe also had a far greater potential to achieve CHIM since heshe was able to speak with Vivec and presumably read the  Lessons. Heshe was also able to kill at least two living gods and had possession of Kagrenacs Tools. I would say the Dragonborn and Nerevarine are fairly equal. Each would win about half the time in my opinion. The Hero of Kvatch on the other hand is undoubtably the weakest of the three unless you count hisher mantling of Sheogorath which you shouldnt really ,skyrim,cjre083,1,t5_2s837

Honestly and this will sound really stupid on my part I didnt even think about grabbing fanconcept art my reasoning was overlaying images might break the dark atmosphere I attempted to construct with the decrepit temple descriptors in the writing and the atmosphere must not be broken! Though I guess the awkward read broke that for you a few times already haha.That was actually a fun read some odd mixture of biological studies crossbred with anthropological looks at individual region lifestyles. Its a very interesting read and it didnt dawn on me at all that the Atronachs would look different based upon region and potential perception of the element they represent such as the flame Atronachs feminine allure. This would involve a working knowledge of most of the games which means Ive got some pretty heavy research and gaming to do. Not that Ill mind after all the fun of the entire Thieves Guild questline and all the horrible things I did for them I really ended up getting involved in just playing the game in general.

If the legion wins the combined force of all legionaffiliated territories could then have a better chance of throwing the Thalmor out when they deem it possible. On the other hand if the Stormcloaks win they would remain friendly with the Empire as long as it stays out of Skyrim and fights the Dominion with them. No matter what both sides are going to work against the elves theyre just too tunnel visioned on each other at the moment. So it doesnt matter who wins.,skyrim,ck2ad8q,42,t5_2s837

1806962,0,t3_2f8l86,I am assuming you dont want to cheat. That said.You have to build up your smithing on the heavy side. Dwarven ruins are great for this as is helping Calcelmo in Markarth because you get a lot of Dwemer metal to make into ingots. If you dont mind stealing then you can go to Narzulburs gloombound mine and get a ton of ebony ore as well as pilfer some from around the forge and from a locked shack just before the bridge on the stronghold side. If you are an Orc or bloodkin taking ore from the mine will not be stealing but taking the other chunks of ore and ingots will be.Get as much Dwemer metal Orcish metal Iron and Corundum as you can plus makebuy steel. The best armor to make to level up your smithing is Orcish. You can also pilfer silver ingots from Dragons Reach and in Halted Stream Camp there is a transmute ore spelltome you can read to learn how to turn iron ore and silver ore into gold. Without cheating it is a slog for sure but it is the quickest way I know. Make sure to take a follower with you when you go looking for Dwemer metal it is heavy stuff.Once you get the invite to the museum at Dawnstar do that quest to get  daedra hearts. You can get another two by doing the Dawnstar city quest and another  but doing Azuras Star.Depending on how much you play and how often this is still going to take a fair amount of time because you have to do a lot. But if you stay dedicated to it and grind away you will get there before you know it.If you dont mind cheating and you are on PC get the Graybeards playable race mod from nexus. Dont activate it until you have leveled up a few times. Then when you do you will get enchanted robes bracers boots and a shield that up your carry weight by  each. Your smithing tree though not at  will automatically have all perk points and there will be a graybeard clone of Angier at High Hrothgar with a Daedric Battle Axe on his back. He will have  daedra hearts for you to buy. Along with other nice goodies. Get those hearts some ebony and boom you have your armor.,skyrim,ck6wshc,2,t5_2s837

Thats what the rebellion is all about what sense would it make for them to yell something about the social structure of their home city that has nothing to do with the actual fight?Speaking of which the Dunmer are there of their own volition. The Gray Quarter was a normal part of the city before they arrived and it was given to them free and clear when they fled from Morrowind after the red mountain volcano erupted. If you talk to NPCs and read some of the books surrounding the situation it shows that they have isolated themselves from everyone else and refused to contribute anything to the city.

1933439,0,t1_ckm128n,There were other scripted dragonfights like the first one you and the Blades take on together when you witness Alduin perform the resurrection ceremony. The mindblowing thing about this is that she tells you about how theres a pattern to the dragon appearances and uses the Dragonstone tablet from Bleak Falls Barrow to predict the next one the Dragonstone if you ever flipped it over in your inventory has a Map of Dragon Burial Sites on its back. You can also refer to the map in the Blades hideout at the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. So you go to Kynesgrove and kill a dragon immediately after it was resurrected woohoo... Nobody explains this to you but you can keep following the map of burial sites all across Skyrim and at each location over a period of time Alduin will appear and perform another resurrection ceremony and say a few choice words to you.

Its an excellent shortcut when you need to get to Ivarstead because it cuts right through one of the mountains. Its not so far off the main road and then starts heading up.

Not like Oblivion reflect where the caster takes the damage but any spells that hit the ward are dissipated and recast at where ever youre aiming.  Works on shouts too so you can kill most dragons incredibly fast by reflecting their breath attacks.Also it gives bonus health and fire resistance and the etchings on the blade glow and leave a trail as you swing or run.,skyrim,cl239ja,7,t5_2s837

I play everything except meleecombat types and so like Fellowgamer said could easily work for a sniper thief or mage.    Truth be told the clothed top  and slightly armored bottom  make me think of nobility riding horses.  Special riding pants exist for a reason especially with a terrain of stonemountains as opposed to grassyfields.  In a perfect vacuum with no info Id guess shes from Solitude and rides often with legwear to provide extra protection from wolves or whatever might attack you while mounted.  If theres an armored jacket thats easier to remove than pants.    TLDR Fuck dem haterz. lol  I have a Female Orc Mage in the College of Winterhold  whose primary skills are Smithing and Enchanting  a niece to Urag groShub the librarian.  She has a grudge to remind other Mer that Orsimer can be just as talented so customforging entire sets of jewelry amp armor to enhance her abilities elsewhere.  I love seeing clothingarmor sets like these that look light enough for a Mage and are custom as if my character handcrafts  gear.

Also Castle Volkihar is disgusting.  Vampires are disgusting.  They are so incredibly messy I cant deal with it  blood and bones everywhere.  Clean the damn castle up you freaks.

2139134,0,t1_clbggne,We know how and why they dissappeared its not a mystery anymore. See the Dwemer were Nihilists they didnt believe in anything. Basically their whole philosophy was NO. They believed there was no god so they built one the Numidium. You know big stompy. They hoped to use it to transcend the mortal plane. Kagrenac used the Profane Tools on the heart to make his entire race into the magical skin of the Numidium so they could transcend. Unfortunately it didnt work Numidium got stuck in this plane which is really bad since Numidium basically embodies disbelief. In a world as dependent on belief as the Elder Scrolls where gods change form based on the beliefs of their followers and landscapes change to suit their inhabitants The Numidium embodying NO means it can make you zerosum which means you realize you are just a figment of someone elses imagination and you disappear meaning its as if you never existed. Were really lucky the Dwemer disappeared when they did they were extremely dangerous.

One of my characters is a dissident high elven wizard who escaped the Night of Green Fire and has been on the run ever since. He understands that political power comes from the use of force and he no longer trusts others to exercise their power responsibly. To that end he seeks to study the arcane at the only remaining institution of magical learning outside the influence of the Thalmorthe College of Winterhold in Skyrim. He views the Empire as a corrupt and decadent puppet state of the Aldmeri Dominion especially after he was nearly executed by the Empire on Thalmor orders and vows to remove that tool from the Thalmors arsenal by aiding Ulfric with his rebellion. By shattering the Empire and helping to create an independent nation hostile to the Dominion he hopes to raise an army of pissed off Nords and take the fight to his homeland. Ysgrammor led the  against the Snow Elves during his Return and this Dovahkiin seeks to lead an elite force of the fiercest warriors in Tamriel in a Second Returnthis time against the Summerset Isles.Power is the only currency in the world. He seeks to acquire as much power as he can and is ruthless in pursuit of this quest. He accepts Lord Harkons gift only to betray the man when his plan to plunge the world into eternal darkness is revealed. He does the bidding of the Daedric Princes to earn their favor. He joins and later comes to lead the best killers for hire the Companions and the Dark Brotherhood. Through his connections to the Thieves guild and his association with the Blades he develops a vast spy network to help him undermine the Thalmors agenda. The world is messed up and he just needs to rule it. ,skyrim,clmq6cv,2,t5_2s837

Anyways Since I was there for over  hours I was allowed to bail out at around  just before the true mayhem started. Ill never forget the looks on peoples faces as I walked out of the store and past hundreds of people and a line that stretched across the mall with my copy of Skyrim in hand while everyone else was made to wait in line for another half an hour or so... It was a mixture of pure hate and jealousy Some people were even shouting curses at me was surprised how pissed people would be at seeing someone with the game only minutes before they got theirs.

It was a written assignment that was giving me some issues. I had no fucking idea how to do it. I have this scholarship and was forced to have a tutor. Hed been through Calc IIV with top marks in every class. I was emailing him back and forth trying my best to figure out how to do the problem. He had no fucking clue. The TAs didnt help me. I really should have talked to my professor about it in hindsight because I actually did start on that assignment a week before it was due.Ended up telling my tutor I needed a break. It was about am so I put on some pants and went out to Game Stop. Stood in line for a bit when something clicked and I figured out what I was doing wrong for one part something my tutor had missed.

2409343,0,t3_2n1gi7,Lots of people suggest role playing builds like a blacksmith or a woodcutter or something. In my experience these playthroughs are funny for a few minutes then grow boring.My favourite build and Ive played through Skyrim at least  times is the paladin. Sword shield and restoration as your primary skills and enchanting smithing as your secondaries. For armour you have a few choices heavy is what a traditional paladin would wear however the glass armour looks the holiest to me so light armour works too. However if you want a real challenge you can go Mage robesalteration. You can really choose any race for this build but I find Imperial works the best due to the boost in restoration.Playing a paladin is fun for a load of reasons quick switching between shield and wards during dragon fights is really intense Spellbreaker is also really good for this build finally getting a chance to use those antiundead spells dragur crypts no longer boring as fuck and even though its kind of roll play being good ie. No stealing or murdering join dawnguard etc..  the build is super viable and really fun to play.,skyrim,cm9i5a6,1,t5_2s837

2481909,0,t3_2o08wd,Performance SSME  Skyrim Startup Memory Patch Skyrim is poor when it comes to handling memory. This mod will improve your performance considerably and reduce crashes to the desktop. Skyrim Project Optimization It doesnt hurt to install this mod. It adds occlusion culling to interior cells so that they dont render the parts of interior cells that are out of view. Grass on Steroids This will improve your performance and allow for fuller grass. However you must follow the installation instructions and tweak your Skyrim.ini or your performance will become worse instead of improving. Optional Go to Documents gt My Games gt Skyrim and open SkyrimPrefs. Set TreesReceiveShadows to  bDrawLandShadows to  and bShadowsOnGrass to . This will make the landscape look a hell of a lot nicer. Performance cost. Static Mesh Improvement Mod Better meshes for Skyrim. Recommended that you install this with NMM. Skyrim HD  K Textures Fairly nice K Textures for most common textures. Climates of Tamriel Weather and Lighting mod. A good overall improvement if you dont want to use a performance intensive ENB. Ruin Clutter Improved amp Vivid Landscapes  Dungeons and Ruins for Nordic Ruins. Vivid Landscapes  Dungeons and Ruins requires compatibility patches for Dynamic Snow and ELFX if you install them. EWIs Dwemer Metal for Dwarven Ruins. aMidianBorn Caves and Mines and Skyrim Realistic Texture Overhaul Caves for generic caves and mines. Realistic Lighting Overhaul or Enhanced Lights and FX for improved interior lighting. Refer to this video for comparisons. Note that ELFX has a slight performance cost and the Exteriors esp is not worth using. aMidianBorn Whiterun. I recommend the k compressed version for better performance. Visual difference is negligible.  Real Wood Textures  Farmhouses Better farmhouses. I recommend that you use the main version of this mod and install the aMidianBorn Farmhouse and Road Stone Wall texture over it. Better Dynamic Snow and K Quality Snow HD for better looking snow. TreesHDSkyrimVariation for nicer looking trees. SkyFalls and SkyMills and Realistic Water Two for better water. Id recommend installing both with NMM to avoid issues and using the High quality textures. aMidianBorn Book of Silence Better armour weapon and creature textures.

For example  A wandering information broker who collects booksscrolls and sells them for profit. Also expanding his own personal library never committing crimes and works for the College of Winterhold. Therefore specialises in light armour all magic and speech while also using spell scrolls. A necromancer searching for powerful thralls. Doesnt use normal followers doesnt steal avoids cities when available vampire and is a dark elf. Specialising in destruction conjuration alteration enchanting and onehanded. A savage duelwielding berserker Orc that wishes to find a good death. Never retreating only wears Orcish armour to honour his people never uses magictransformations forges his own equipment only uses animal or Orc followers and earns money by selling loot from conquered dungeonsforts. Specialises in onehanded heavy armour speech and flameenchantments. These are just a few of my characters think of something interesting. Enjoy!,skyrim,cmumqkx,1,t5_2s837

2707418,0,t1_cnbr7d5,gtI have never played any of the companion marriageromance type options in Skyrim through to their conclusions or proper marriageJust in case you never looked into it theres actually only MAYBE a halfhours worth of unique content involved with character marriage. If that. Probably not even that much.You do whatever miniquest that the character you want to marry needs then you go to the chapel in Riften and theres a marriage ceremony which lasts all of maybe  minutes. Then they set up in your house and you can go visit them. Theyll cook food for you and give you half of the money they make from whatever they do to earn septims. All of that is taken care of in incredibly short dialogue sequences when you return to your house. Oh and you can sleep in the spousal bed next to your partner for an Extremely Well Rested...WINK WINK buff.You can take that as oh okay I guess I didnt miss out on a huge amount of content or as well maybe Ill go do it then because its not that much of a time investment.Its a cool thing that they had in the game. All in all the childadoption thing in Hearthfire consists of much more content. Oddly enough I havent ever had a character with children a homestead and also a spouse. I assume your spouse comes to live in your Hearthfire house which would actually make the marriage thing feel like theres more to it since youre in the house you built etc.,skyrim,cnbtn7j,1,t5_2s837

Develop an attachment.  make your character have flaws. The perfect hero is boring. Maybe youre scared of spiders. Or heights. Maybe you have an irrational hatred for rabbits.  get some new mods to make things fresh do a playthrough that is different than what youd normally do before you start your playthrough write about your character. A short story detailing their background and what they did just before being caught at the border if you dont have any alternate start mods. If you use them then just write about whatever happened before youd start the game wherever youd be when making decisions dont think of what you want to do. Think of what the character wants to do based on their background etc.  Dont have a concrete plan for your character. Let them make their own choices about where things would go. The random events that happen during the game can change a lot and the decisions youd normally make might not make sense depending on how things happenTo sum this all up what you need to do is make your character its own person,skyrim,cnlrlgi,1,t5_2s837

It will be very worth that little I promise you.In the mean time... NMM should still work regardless. You really should use it to install EVERY mod. Either that or Mod Organizer though Im still using NMM myself. MO is much more difficult to learn to use but many swear that its the best option to install mods with nowadays. It separates all mods contents into individual folders instead of dumping them into your main Skyrim directory. This way your Skyrim directory is clean as vanilla but mods will still function when you start the game up. However you might have problems with mod files overwriting one another as I have but there are workarounds you can try if youre willing. Again MO is much more difficult to use than NMM.NMM is simple and straightforward if you decide to use it I suggest you go for NMMs new alpha version .x or x. cant remember the exact version number which utilises a new mod installation method supposedly much cleaner for your game folder.,skyrim,co7neqq,1,t5_2s837

3030947,0,t3_2uulks,This will get messy but all I can think of are these. Do not fast travel. First play through you should listen to all dialogue. Set yourself a weightvalue ratio so that you dont go over your carry limit too soon. Get a horse as soon as possible when youre over your carry limit you will need that horse to get to the nearest merchant asap. Use whirlwind sprint in townvillages where you want to move fast for when youre over your carry limit. If you use a bow you can draw it and move faster than normal when youre over your carry limit. Do not sell Dragon BonesScales when youre smithing youll thank yourself later for not being an idiot. When mining keep the ores for leveling your smithingcreating stuff. Do not abuse the alchemyenchanting gold making methods. Skyrim gets boring when youre rich. Save often. Dont spend Dragon Souls as soon as you get them. Most locations respawn at  in game days. Some respawn every ? Horde lockpicks and dont be afraid to use them. If they break you still level up your lockpick skill. It helps when you craft your own potions. They may not be as strong as those you found but the experience you get when you make your own is worth it. Get a home as soon as possible. The chest your getting will come in handy when you need to put something away for later use. Do not be afraid to start over. Its one of the best parts. Create one save before character creation and keep it safe.

And Tacos and Burgers and Sammiches were equal and none was above the others and there was harmony on the earth and there was much eating amongst the people of Earth.  And the peoples of the earth built mighty temples to Tacos Burgers and Sammiches and assigned people to be priests thereof and to guide in the appreciation of the edibles therein and there was peace among the peoples of earth and much eating.  Yet soon came a time of darkness and the peoples of the earth became no longer content to have many good things and declared unto the heavens We are no longer pleased with the many good things we have but must have the one best thing! and the heavens did no answer for one edible had yet been placed above the others.  Hearing no answer from the heavens caused much dismay among the priests of the edibles and among the followers of the priests there was much gnashing of teeth and the people each cried to each other that their favorite edible was greatest and that the others favorite edibles were secondary and thus began the war of edible ascension.   For many dark years the battles raged and the blood flowed like salsa or ketchup depending on the blood and broken bones littered the fields where the people of earth had once dined together on many foodthings but mens hearts are dark and their need for the best overrules their appreciation of good things so on the battles did rage through the centuries and into the millennia.  At last the followers of the tacos were able throw down the temples of the Burgers and the Sammiches and the people recognized that while good their edibles were not the best and accepted the preeminence of Tacos. As the priest of Tacos led the incantation and the people of the earth contained their various meats in various forms of shells Tacos was surrounded by an uplifting light and took his rightful place in the heavens. And there was much rejoicing for a while until the people went off to determine which Operating System was the best thing.   ,skyrim,code88c,5,t5_2s837

I just merge what the program says. I have seen Gophers TESedit cleaning thing so far ive only cleaned update dawnguard and dragonborn. I think those were the only  he said to clean. Havent cleaned anything else.next playthrough I am definitely gonna just start from scratch and do the STEP thing and then addremove whatever I feel like. Just so i kinda have like a base package of graphicsgameplay that i know is stable at least according to STEP. maybe add civil war overhaul to that and see if CWO truly is the cause and I think it is cuz of script overload. also might try out tamriel reloaded and noble skyrim to see which one I like better.

3198321,0,t3_2wrmts,Theres a difference between letting someone live in your city and harassing them and refusing jobs until they have started their own minicivilization within the city. The Nords of Windhelm call the Dunmer parasites for two main reasons They dont contribute to the war effort Many Nords arent contributing to the war and arent harassed for it. There is no excuse for this. They do not benefit the cities trade in any way Probably the only valid excuse they have for hating the Dunmer. However if I was constantly called a piece of shit by the Nords then I wouldnt want to work in one of their establishments either. This is why the Grey Quarter has its own shops and society independent from the Nords.They may have let them in but the Nords created their own problems by being so goddamn stubborn. Their gift of allowing the Dunmer to live in their city isnt really a gift at all not when they are being abused and harassed for it.Also another point you made that I dont agree with The Dunmer are proud and arrogant. Okay that is literally racism very few Dark Elves are like this. On Solsthiem they welcome you with open arms and even give you a house after assisting them with their problems. Furthermore they have integrated multiple humans into their society. Im having a hard time even trying to come up with any proud and arrogant Dunmer.

Im at the point where I feel like I cant even fully immerse myself anymore because the game will actively find new problems  hours in despite all previous testing. IF I can fix a problem itll likely take  minutes because one problem leads to another and then its time rebuild the bashed patch repatch ASIS get FNIS reworking again. I know more about Papyrus scripting than I ever wanted. And Im not blindly installing things I read up on these mods I watch others play them I get everything required and learn what these mods do to the game.But at some point somehow someway Moon and Star will start having script problem that crash the game despite being nowhere near Little Vivec. Or perhaps itll be My Home is Your Home? Or perhaps deactivatingnot even uninstalling a single armor mod is enough to set the game back into its primordial ooze state.

Clean out your xbox with canned air. I did this pretty religiously. Im a little of a clean freak. Always create new save games instead of saving over old ones.

3321171,0,t3_2y6zko,It had taken him too long to decide upon his path.For months the Dovahkiin had been trapped in the middle of a feud between the Greybeards and the Blades. Ever since he had wound up in that room below the Inn in Riverwood he had been torn in two opposing directions.On one hand he had the Greybeards who told him that peace and meditation was the means towards enlightenment and finding his destiny. On the other he had the Blades who asked him to fight with them to stop the return of the dragons through combat and bloodshed.For many people the violent methods of the Blades would seem like an obvious path to avoid but he knew what was at stake. The meaning of Alduins wall was all too clear to him. If he didnt face Alduin no one would and meditating on the top of a mountain wouldnt bring him any closer to defeating his foe.But he needed the Greybeards help. They had power though they didnt often use it. If they could whisper a word and kill a man with it what could he do if he mastered their power? He had often asked them to share their knowledge to teach him the secrets that he knew they held but they would only refuse each time he asked.He was forced to look elsewhere for the power he needed thats what led him to the College Mages. There he learned of the Dragon Priests and the powerful magic they wielded. Some of these priests became so powerful that their dragon masters took special notice of them and gifted them with mysterious artifacts. To wield such power as to warrant attention from the dragons... surely they must have had immensely powerful abilities.That was when he decided on his own path. He would not walk the way of the warmonger nor the monk but rather the path of the Dragonpriest. He would learn their secrets and use them in a way that could only be called ironic to wipe their masters from the face of Nirn. He would study their magic he would learn their secrets and when he was ready...He would shout them down with the force of a god.,skyrim,cp6ubgq,3,t5_2s837

As others have said it does get super redundant when the quest boils down to talk to NPC travel to dungeon draugr get item return to NPC and I think small backstories built into the landscape help make the different dungeons feel unique.,skyrim,cpal0cn,7,t5_2s837

3391779,0,t3_2z1o77,. People loved Morrowind so this was partially a fan service. With Morrowind almost entirely destroyed or unlivable Solsthiem is used to see the effect the eruption of Red Mountain has had on the neighboring environment the island is also relatively small which makes it a good size for a DLC. Solsthiem is like the lovechild of Skyrim and Morrowind it is inhabited by Nords as well as Dunmer. This allows us to experience Dunmer culture while still remaining relevant to the theme of the DLC the return of the First Dragonborn. It would not make sense to put the DLC on the mainland of Morrowind because the dragon culture and worship was not nearly as prevalent there.,skyrim,cpew17p,2,t5_2s837

I know that you can turn up the difficulty but thats artificial difficulty. Instead of smarter enemies they just make the enemies have tons of more health and do tons more damage. Its not hard its boring. Even the puzzles are solvable by a yearold in about a minute. I never finished it but my sister got me to play Silent Hill the original since she loves those games and the puzzles were great. I was writing down and drawing out how to do these from hints and my failed trys. Once I completed those puzzles I felt a sense of accomplishment. I wish Skyrim had that. Theyve sold what?

Its fine without them but on PC with modding capabilities it opens up a lot of doors. But what I would do if you have the base game is have these couple installed as they help a bit as is.Skyrim Project Optimization Will help your framerate a lot even if youre basically just playing vanillaUnofficial Skyrim Patch Makes the base game much less buggy which in turn can help performancestability Safety Load Not really a performance one but prevents infinite loading screens. Its stability.Other things you can do is run things like Remove Interior Fog removes interior fog making it look better and may give you a couple framesTheres lots of stuff you can do like these for example that make it way more optimized past what the devs have for the base game lol,skyrim,cppqeuv,1,t5_2s837

Like in Dawnstar you might get a dragon and vampire attack simultaneously with the vampires at the other side of town. Which is why I advised the follower and dog  and extra armour and weapons for people you want to protect just so that they can hang on till you can get to them.You can also equip guards with better weapons so that the enemies are killed quicker. To be honest though I think the issue is overstated in  playthroughs I had Adrianne the smith in Dawnstar and his wife and the smith Lod die on me once.

3638097,0,t3_31yicb,Mine arent usually too long but there are lots of them and theyre rarely lorefriendly! A snobby Altmer prince sent to the College to reign in his powers. A NordDunmer guy who was always told tales of the Dragonborn in his childhood. He was kidnapped and tortured by Stormcloaks as a punishment for his Nord father then gaslighted into thinking hed been arrested trying to cross the border when they were caught. A classic raised by bears Breton. My Redguard girl is my favorite. She was the daughter of the chief of a wandering band of Redguards in Hammerfell. All of them have to go through trials before they can be marked as warriors. She completed her first three trials with amazing promise and is first in line to replace her father as chief. Her fourth trial is a sort of spirit journey spending a year in another land and returning a changed person and a stronger warrior. When she discovers her destiny in Skyrim she struggles to choose between returning to her tribefamily when her year is up or staying to fulfill her destiny and help the land and people that have been so kind to her. I think I ended up writing an almost k story for her and I add more every so often if inspiration strikes.I believe I have eight characters overall and I try to give them all at least enough of a backstory to affect their decisions. Except for my very first character who just did whatever I thought would be fun.,skyrim,cq6yy15,1,t5_2s837

For race and playstyle.. Dunmer or Altmer mage ConjurationDestructionAlteration focus thats my favorite anyway. Restoration is also a perfectly valid school of magic and has some really useful perks when you git gud at it.

3660637,0,t3_32awuf,The war between the Snow Elves and Nords began at Saarthal on the Night of Tears presumably when the Snow Elves attacked the city. However they did so to get the Eye of Magnus which may or may not have actually been stolen by the Nords in the first place. Even if the Nords didnt steal it the Snow Elves still had a very good reason to attack the Nords as they were essentially living on Snow Elf land and claiming it for their own. The fact that the Nords might be planning to tamper with one of the most dangerous and powerful artifacts that has been proven as of the events of Skyrim to have been capable of destroying Tamriel might have been the last straw. That isnt to say what they did was right but it might have been a last resort.The Nords DID commit genocide against the Snow Elves. They probably would have been completely annihilated if the Dwemer didnt agree to help them. Unfortunately that backfired and they ended up as blind elfcavemen.The Night of Tears is shrouded in mystery but seeing as how the Snow Elves had been relatively peaceful and focused on religion up until that point it is incredibly likely they attacked Saarthal because they thought it was their only option. Perhaps they tried to convince the Nords to leave the Eye alone but failed and to protect Skyrim decided their only option was to attack the city in order to save millions of lives. The attack would otherwise be completely out of character for them.,skyrim,cq9jdp4,3,t5_2s837

This is because the save will have things in it that rely on certain objects or data being present that you have removed by uninstalling the mod.Make a few copies of a random save and test mods in there. That way you get to play around with any given mod for a while to see if you want to add it to your main game knowing that uninstalling could mean the death of your save so save before the install as well and if you notice any problems you can just kill it with no permanent harm.,skyrim,cqlbpcx,2,t5_2s837

3774654,0,t1_cqm9k2q,I really cannot believe how short sighted Bethesda are being here. Lets face it Fallout and Elder Scroll games are buggy as shit when theyre launched and even now years on theres still game breaking bugs which have never been fixed. Theres a reason that Skyrim and Fallout are still incredibly high on the most played lists and why they get such an easy ride when it comes to bugs and that reason is modding. You can take an okay game and make it fantastic with mods for free.  That gives the game an incredibly extended lifespan compared to every other game out there. Skyrim is still at  on the most played chart tonight and its  years old thats absolutely insane. Theyve made this happen by being open with mods and modders and letting them do their thing. Theyve sold thousands of copies of their games on the back of this including thousands of repeat copies where people have bought one console then one for pc for mods. Now you can pay for a game which is usually pretty average and pay more to make it good! Maybe because hell you dont know if that mod is actually going to be good or even if its going to work at all. Theres not a chance in hell any new games will see the same level of success when you have to buy the mods on top of DLC on top of the game. I sure as fuck wont be buying multiple copies so I can pay again to mod it.Im also worried about what this will do to games in general. Why would you bother polishing and fine tuning your game when you can have an army of terribly paid modders do it for you? What happens to the unofficial Skyrim patch now?

Its something people do because they wanted to change or add something to the game. What happens when the mod release is broken and fucked? Charge for the patch that comes in the form of another mod? . pence here? . there? If youre lucky? Nobody not one single modder EVER published a mod expecting pay. They did it because they wanted to change a part of a game they didnt like and wanted to help other people change their games too. These motherfuckers werent modding on hopes and dreams they evidently have incomes. The entire concept of modding is a community driven platform that allows people to share and exchange files that alter gameplay aspects. It was never legal to do so it was just tolerated and ignored. Now youre charging people to place a file in their directory that has work done by other people and then built on top of to create the existing mod. It is actually illegal to charge anything for mods. It is in direct violation of the End User License Agreement to attach a pricetag to a mod because somebody is being stolen from which is unfair.

3810798,0,t1_cqqebc5,My personal idea is a pay what you want subscription model. With subscribers above a certain level receiving rewards provided by the author be is access to beta versions early access to releases some small pieces of content for higher donations things like ability to voice act in the mod or modding tutorials from the author whatever they can think of. They can even have a communal counter for things like extra features.This would allow for the modders to set their own prices in a way. It keeps the mods free. It gives the modders reliable income this promotes high quality large projects instead of small additions like armor or shitty npcs. It also discourages false advertising as the user can cancel the subscription at any time or choose to subscribe after playing the mod for a bit removing any sort of paywall. The issue with this is that it might promote paywalling significant content and it would be much harder to make this model fit noncontent mods like SkyUI or Unnofficial Patches but I feel mods of that level of popularity would receive donations regardless especially with people trying to make the point that this system would be successful.Also with a system like this you are paying the modder for their services instead of for a product in which case Bethesda has no real claim to a cut of the profit although valve still would. This means that it would not promote developers to release buggy games like the current system may.,skyrim,cqqntoi,1,t5_2s837

3842195,0,t3_34d2ox,The article was quite impartial and that was refreshing. The best of it however is this comment from a certain Silver The issue is that payment raises expectations of quality compatibility and ongoing support. All things modding cannot guarantee for so many reasons.When you pay for DLC to a game like Skyrim you know its going to work. If it runs into issues you know patches are coming. If the base game receives an update likely to break addons like DLC and mods you know the DLC team has enough time to update their addon to work from day one of the new patch. If a key developer on the DLC leaves you know someone else from the team will step in to continue the work and support.Conversely with moddingWhen you install a new mod you cant be sure it will work as intended on your setup. If the mod runs into issues you hope the mod author will stick around to fix them. If the base game receives an update usually rendering mods incompatible until the author updates them for the new patch the author wont receive early access to the update to ensure day  compatibility for the mod you paid for. Youll hope they manage to update your now broken mod within a few days. If the mod author leaves the modding scene either due to lack of interest or real life issues like a job or family concern that obviously take precedence then your mod will remain broken after a game update for as long as the author remains MIA. Noone else will step in to continue the work unless the author specifically arranges it.Thats why demanding payment doesnt work for mods. Its an amateur hobby not a professional job. There is no guaranteed support for the customer. You cannot sell something you cant guarantee will work. Especially when theres only a  hour refund window. Donations would work but payment raises so many expectations and legal concerns its really not viable.,skyrim,cqu8sr9,3,t5_2s837

3850973,0,t3_34ias2,I dont know PC controls but it isnt enough to just equip a shield. You have to press the block button to use it.If you plan on using a shield long term get the first perk and then deflect arrows perk on the left side of the tree. You will notice an immense difference in your effective blocking skills.Pay attention to your enemies. While actively blocking if you press the attack button you can bash. Thatll stagger them and give you a small window of time within which to attack them with your sword. If you have a spell in one hand and a sword in the other your best bet is to quickly alternate the two to allow your magicka to regen and to take advantage of the burn damage that fire spells have. I dont know a lot about fighting as a destruction spellsword but it seems like youll want to alternate destruction spells depending on your enemies. Fire for draugr and most animals frost and shock for most people unless theyre nords whore resistant to frost. I would also consider choosing one or the other destruction or onehanded weapons. Maintaining the two in the early stages is going to be tough.Invest perks in light armor. A lot of posts may tell you its a waste of perks but unless you are already heavy into smithing unlikely at level  you need to make your armor stronger. Restoration also helps you to take a few hits in order to level up your armor. Pay attention to your health bar at all times when it is getting kinda low run away double equip healing spells and heal yourself. Potions are great but should be saved for when you are in desperate need. Its pretty easy to abuse potions and forget that you have a spell that may take a little more time to work but will be there for you even when you run out of potions.Restoration is also worth perking up no matter what your build is. Get the perk to make healing spells heal more and try to get magicka reduction perks if you can spare them. It is the only school of magic that no build will ever regret investing in and its never too late to do so.Light armor has great benefits. It is lighter so it doesnt really slow you down. Great for getting out of sticky situations with sabre tooth cats. Its also quieter so its great for sneaking. Youll need to stay light on your feet to run away from twohanded power attacks from bandits and to run circles around giants mammoths and draugr. Bears and sabre cats are a different story but youll at least be in a better position to run to cover than you would have been while wearing heavy armor.,skyrim,cqv8vcr,2,t5_2s837

3863188,0,t1_cqwk59g,Well there are two methods  one that works within the boundaries of the game and one that uses an exploit to create godmode level weapons.When you get your enchanting to  and get all the perks down the center of the skill tree the  at the bottom and the  center ones youll be able to place  enchantments on weapons and armor.   To reduce spellcasting to zero you would enchant a ring a necklace a circlethelmet and armorclothes with Fortify Destruction or whatever magic type you want.  The max level for spell reduction is   So with all  pieces enchanted you end up with almost  reduction in magic cost.  You will get over  if you drink a potion of Fortify Enchanting  which you can find or buy from alchemists or make your own if you focus on Alchemy.Now regarding the exploit.  Its known as the Fortify Restoration Glitch  What happens is this whenever you drink a potion of Fortify Restoration all of the enchantments on the clothes you have equipped get boosted.   So if you have a pair of gloves that increase your archery by  and you drink a potion of Fortify Restoration suddenly those gloves will boost your archery to  for  seconds.   So if you enchant gloves rings necklaces and hats with fortify alchemy  each one at max will boost your skill by say    With all  pieces you make potions  more potent than before.  Now you make a potion of Fortify Restoration.  That potion is  more powerful than normal.  Then you drink that potion  and all of your alchemy equipment is suddenly  more powerful.  Heres the trick unequip your alchemy equipment and then reequip it immediately.   Make another potion of Fortify Restoration and drink it.  That potion is already  more powerful than the first.  Now all of your gear will make potions  more powerful.  Unequipreequip and do it again and again and again until you can make potions of fortify restoration that do  boost.    make as many potions of Fortify Restoration as you can at this point.Now drink that that one and make potions of Fortify Enchanting.  Make a bunch.   Typically you can do whatever you want with armor  boots that carry lbs a ring that ignores all magic damage a necklace that regenerates your health instantly but beware when it comes to weapons.   Your weapon enchantments should only do  or less damage.  If you go too far over that the enchantment will either stop working once the weapon is depleted or you will have to refill it after every  hits with a grand soul gem.   The other option is to not enchant the weapon but instead enchant your gloves and boots to boost your one or twohanded skill to ridiculous levels.  That way your sword will be doing hundreds of points of damage and you never need to recharge it because its actually your gloves doing the damage.Typically I dont use the exploit because its gamebreaking.  However when I feel the need to make a truly amazing weapon Ill use it.   Most of the unique weapons you find in the game are rather weak and they dont level with you.   It annoys me that the super rare Daedric Lord weapons end up being weaker than weapons you can just make yourself.   So Ill forge myself my own super Daedric weapon  like a wooden sword that does  damage called the Splinter of the Sleeping Tree or Boots of might that let me carry lbs.  But nothing that makes me invincible.   Also there are some unique weapons that look amazing  like the Headsmans Axe.  But its glitched and cannot be upgraded at the grindstone.  So I make myself some gloves that raise the damage to   about what a dragonbone axe would do  so I can use that weapon.   Its a great way to get around certain broken game elements if you dont have the option for mods.But thats just me.  The whole point is to have fun.  Do whatever you like. ,skyrim,cqwmz2o,2,t5_2s837

Squarefaced with wide and strong jaw and almost bull neck. An ugly scar crosses his alwaysdirty and illlooking face. Small bloodshot blue eyes. Pale lips. He wears very short hair and a beard tied in a knot. He usually wears poorlooking heavy armor or dirty clothes with no armor in sight. If he is drunk enough he can even run around in the snow naked. He carries a poorly crafted fur tent a pickaxe and an axe on his back and a rusty iron knife in his belt. He fights unarmed. Easygoing loud foulmouthed boozer wooer. Will sack and loot will provoke nonnords will attack if provoked wont murder innocents unless necessary. Likes Booze fun and women. A good brawl with a good friend. Smithing. Nord traditions high honor and proving he is a true nord. Dislikes Strict rules hard headed people like his brother being told what to do foreigners flowers magic.Hates Being looked down upon Imperial guards Thalmor.First and only stormcloak run but man I truly enjoyed that prick!

3886533,0,t3_34ww3r,Skyrims main quest would not make a very good movie.  It actually makes very little sense and there is fuck all for suspense building.This makes sense in the game because the developers want you go forget about Alduin and explore once in a while.  But it doesnt make any sense in a movie.  The plot of the game just isnt set up in a way that translates to a movie well.Another problem with this is that Bethesdas core competency is world building.  Thats great in games  it helps you feel more immersed like the world is more real.  But for a movie its just more boring exposition.  For example the dark brotherhood questline has great writing and could be a good movie except youd have to spend the first hour or more of the movie explaining that this is a fantasy world where magic works and also theres this assassins guild with some weird rituals behind it... and at that point most people would already have walked out.,skyrim,cqzar55,2,t5_2s837

The dangerous ones IMHO are the smaller ones.

They wish to drive everyone who isnt them out of the Reach and do this by raiding settlements and murdering everyone. Their only justification is reclaiming the lost Reachmen kingdom which they obtained by slaughtering countless Nords and seizing control of the Reach during the Great War.

A world designed to allow players to do everything in almost any order and avoid doing anything theyre not interested in. monster spawn leveling comes from this philosophy More side quests and dungeons than you will likely ever finish. game is designed to have more hours of content than most people will play through so that you never feel like you were forced to do something just for completion and you will never feel like youve completed everything,skyrim,csawspm,8,t5_2s837

4315939,0,t1_csc0w96,I mean its pretty close. I tried TESO during the beta weekend and couldnt even slog through the first few quests in the zone after the starting island for Aldmeri Dominion players youre no longer forced to do the starting island either before getting bored but its actually really great now. Started playing a month or two ago and its enjoyable. Id actually rate it as superior to vanilla Skyrim. Better combat system better quests better crafting better stat system better magic better character customization Khajiit and Argonians look a lot better better quests more diverse landscapes granted ESO spans more than just Skyrim better dungeon design a better UI the PC and console versions have different ones and theyre both excellent and a larger map. Slightly loses out in exploration though. If theres one thing TES games should take from TESO its the combat system. You have two weapon sets you can switch to with a hotkey in combat and each weapon set has a hotbar you put  abilities on. Theres dodging manually and with a hotkey you can press to roll for a stamina cost parryingblocking a light attack and a heavy attack. TES games have always suffered most in their combat and abilities feel awkward to use because you have to equip them in a hand and keep switching them around in the middle of a fight. Placing so much emphasis on blocking makes it so higher difficulties are just you do barely any damage but the enemy bandit one shots you and the realism turns everyone into a sneak archer that one shots everything in their path. It also causes script lag on heavily modded games to make it extra frustrating but thats mostly a problem with Papyrus.Even if you dont have an interest in playing it as an MMO its still super fun if played as a single player. Ive only grouped up once for a low level dungeon and have still had a blast.

4360229,0,t3_3axuzg,I think we can all agree that there is no easy answer to this one which is exactly why I love it so much.uPhuPhuSnugglyShitz posted  links one of them corrected by uythri Why the stormcloacks are right part  Why the stormcloacks are right part These are followed up by an April fools post saying the empire was rightPersonally since the Thalmor are trying to eradicate human life from the Pattern of Possibility this imgur album does a good job explaining that and check out this thread they should be seen as the main bad guy in my opinion.I think the Imperials and the Stormcloaks are both right and both wrong. The argument is made that since Hammerfell could stall the Aldmeri Dominion so why would the stormcloaks not be able to do that?from the wikigt E   The Second Treaty of Stros Mkai is signed.gtHaving been fought to a standstill by the Redguards the Aldmeri Dominion completely withdraws from Hammerfell making Hammerfell the only nation to defeat the Third Aldmeri Dominion. The fact that this was done largely by themselves makes this feat more impressive. Finally through the cooperation between Forebearers and Crowns the civil war in Hammerfell ends.It is mentioned in the lore that nords are capable of defeating orcs just like the early redguards couldgtMost of these refugees would stay on the island of Herne Lore but a group of warrior Yokudans known as the Ra Gada traveled to the mainland in E  and swept across the country to claim as much land as they could slaughtering or enslaving the local beastfolk and Nedic tribes. Eventually Yokudan royalty known as NaTotambu left the island of Herne and made their place in Hammerfell after the Ra Gada drove off the Orsimer. The name Redguard originates from Ra Gada.I would argue that being able to defeat orcs is a pretty strong sign that you are able to defeat the Thalmor. I dont think that this is an argument in favor of the Stormcloaks though some like to use it as such. The WhiteGold Concordat as you know banned the worshipping of Talos. I think that the anger of the Stormcloaks is justified but they should look past their pride to see that it is more benificial to join forces with the Empire to gain back control of Skyrim.Whether or not they should have the land to their own is still debatable but I think we should be able to conclude from this that although both are kind of right and kind of wrong the timing of the civil war is terrible and Ulfric should have been able to see this.TLDR Stormcloaks and Imperials are both kind of right and kind of wrong but the timing of the Civil War is horrible. Ulfric should have seen that. Not saying that this means that the Empire is more right per se Im questioning Ulfrics ability to lead I guess.EDIT The wiki page seems to be clear about it  The Stormcloaks are a faction that formed after the WTG which means that before they might have been unhappy but not enough for civil war. They were unhappy about how the empire was becoming a puppet of the Aldmeri. The Stormcloaks want the land for themselves and the Imperials want Skyrim as a part of the Empire. I personally think that even if the Stormcloaks were to win the Civil War theyd still have to defeat the Aldmeri Dominion.,skyrim,csh4qo8,9,t5_2s837

So yes if you take out the shooting elements the game can still function but my argument isnt on functionality but that the game can simply be categorized as an FPS on some level because Skyrim fits the definition. Is it the best description for the game? No does it vaguely fall under the category FPS? I think so.Thank you for your comment.

The base of the empire would be a great fortress built on the lonely hill on the middle of the Whiterun plains.   The Thalmor would be our main enemy but first we would establish a base in Whiterun and convert Dragonsreach into a great court of law and centre of Admiistration and trade. Next we would capture Falkreath and Morthal as Morthal would be a great outpost for resupply against Solitude and Falkreath has wood and a great location for a fallback Citadel last resort.Next Markath for its mines and its Dwemer ruins to build and forge weapons that would be carted to Whiterun and then onto Dawnstar for the ports the fish and the land. Winterhold would be next for the college and then proximity to Windhelm. Windhelm would need to go and the stormcloaks put down. Next Riften would be taken just cause and the thieves guild contacted and put on our side. Finally Solitude would be besieged and I would attempt to convince Tulius to join me the mans a genius or if not take the city. I would then launch an extended  by  campaign in High rock and offer Hamerfell and Orsinium full civil autonomy in return for military cooperation and future support as part of the empire. Orsinium would also get new land and a few more cities. Next morrowind would be taken and the Argonians liberated and the Dunmer part of the Empire. BlackMarsh would get the Hammerfell deal offered to them as well. Through some clever speachcraft I would convince the Khajiit that the Altmer took the moons first and then gave them back as a ruse. Hopefullly enraging the Khajiit enough to switch sides.Finnally I would offer Cyrodil a chance to surrender or fall but if they chose not to surrender I would wreck them. Afterwards I would move around Valenwood and use my navy to run a suprise deployment of elite redguard shocktroops to breach the sea defenses and send a group of stealth warriors khajiiti to assasinate key figures. The redguards best shock troops would again be deployed marine style in unexpected areas whilst my main army moves forward unstapably. Finally I would eradicate the Thalmor and leave the Summerset Isles as a unique independent province. However I feel that afyer the defeat of the Thalmor Altmeri the Bosmer would surrender especially if the razing of valeneood is on the table.As now ruler of all Tameriel I would .

4456710,0,t3_38ufmm,Long have I traveled to bring you these pages.th of Heartfire E I set out from Riverwood at dawn. I met little trouble on the road north save some wolves and passed by the walled city of Whiterun without meeting anyone.As I drew near the border of The Pale I saw a dunmer in what looked like black mage robes. He introduced himself to me as Faldrus but would say no more. We followed the road together for a time in silence until early in the afternoon it began to snow.Through the snowfall I saw a bear ahead on the road. I cautioned Faldrus to stay back and dashed up the road a short distance taking cover behind a low rock wall on the far side of the path from the bear. From cover I summoned a flame atronach into the road between me and the bear. I waited until the bear had fully engaged the atronach then I began to fling fire at it. To my surprise the bear seemed to shrug off my flames. The bear chewed through the atronach alarmingly quickly then it lunged at me. I was too drained to cast more firebolts and drew my dagger hacking at the bear furiously. The bears claws tore at me then more flame began to tear into the bear. Faldrus had joined the fray! The two of us turned the tide of the battle and as the bear roared in fury I plunged my dagger into its throat. I thanked Faldrus for his help but still he would not speak to me.Weary of my taciturn traveling companion I turned off the road near the remains of a stone archway heading more directly for the Nightgate Inn. I had not gone far down the trail when I saw a wolf running towards me. I readied a firebolt and each hand carefully timing my attack. Too late I realized it was no ordinary wolf. The snow wolf wasnt deterred by my flames and bit my arms savagely as I pummeled it with fire. The wolf turned to retreat but collapsed from its burns after a few steps. I cast healing spells on my arms but cursed myself for not bringing a cure disease potion. Ive surely contracted rockjoint again.I continued on passing by the entrance to Shrouded Grove. Earlier in the day I had considered venturing back in but thought better of it. The local wildlife had already given me enough trouble for one day. I had not gone far past the grove when I saw another bear meandering on the trail up ahead. It hadnt seen me yet. I sighed and turned north climbing uphill back towards the road. So much for my shortcut.Despite the delays I reached the Nightgate Inn well ahead of sunset. I had time to stand on their small pier while eating my dinner watching the light fade.I did not know what to expect in Dawnstar. My contact told me a man Silus Vesuius was willing to pay good coin for the razor and that I would find him in Dawnstar. But I had gone to Dawnstar with the shards and found no one named Silus and no one who knew him. Eventually I figured the information must have been bad and went looking for other work.Now my buyer has suddenly appeared opening some museum in Dawnstar.

I havent decided if he himself will combat them or if hell hire bodyguards. Its not everyones idea of a fun playthrough but I feel like it could lead to a lot of things. Perhaps he ends up becoming a vampire while traveling and becomes power hungry with his newfound extended life?

So my ranger character needs  shots from an enchanted daedric bow with daedric arrows with  marksman and  agility to take down a levelled dread zombie. Its just absurd.

Alchemy is used to poison his sword Restoration simulated the hydras regenerative properties Poison rune fits with the idea too  handed weapons for damage purposes and use of the marked for death shout because its the closest to a poison weakens the enemy and provides a DOT. The roleplaying aspect of the build is the character was a child born to imperial nobles but was kidnapped shortly after birth by a deranged healer who told the family the child had died. The healer experimented with dark magic on the child turning them into a living weapon. The child eventually found out what had happened and killed the healer. I enjoyed going through the process of the character changing from a kill whoever looks at me funny type of guy to a true hero. dark brotherhood quest linegt Dark Brotherhood Spoilerd Astrids betrayel lead him to believe in the no honor among thieves attitude and left to become a hero gt Joining the Dawnguard and hunting vampires gt Companioins gt Main quest line gt Dragonborn quest line.,skyrim,ct9uxav,2,t5_2s837

Dawnbreaker would also be an excellent weapon for his use Molag Bal In his darkest times he could be corrupted to the side of the daedric prince for the sake of power and domination Malacath It unlikely hed actually worship Malacath but hed likely sympathize with him and not see him as evil. This could easily form into a respect for Orcs or vise versa. Id recommend going to Markarth and talk to the miners outside the city.

4770569,0,t3_3g654e,Neat. My Breton Mage was from a normal family in High Rock. As soon as he reached adulthood he wanted to seek more knowledge in Magic. His parents were not trained but knew a bit as they are Bretons. The family hit upon hard times when the farm was hexxed by an enemy and have put all their money into my Breton getting to Skyrim to study at Winterhold and hopefully return home and bring the rest of the family out of poverty. with only some ragged cloths he left the cart at Skyrims border where the hired cart had been ordered to stop. Unfortunately Stormcloaks were messing around in the area and got him caught up in the mess while he was just trying to get to winterhold. Wanting revenge against the Stormcloaks that got him entangled in this mess he joined the legion as a battlemage while he studied at the college... well it help him to decide upon remembering his uncles imperial service during the great war.. He ended up settleing in Whiterun marrying the sister of the Riverwood trader and making a family of his own with adopted children A Breton son and an Imperial Daughter. His wife runs a shop. He has since sent note to his family and gave them enough coin to get a new farm over in High rock but has said he is unfortunately too busy to go and visit any time soon but there are now regular notes gong back and forth. The family is proud of his achievements in Skyrim and proud of their son.,skyrim,ctvvg02,2,t5_2s837

Some areas are fine but when I went to the Winking Skeever or the Whiterun area during the very first part of the siege where you meet Galaran or whatever his name is my FPS drops to less than  FPS and textures will pop in and out.  Hair and clothes disappear and reappear.  I cant even move.  Its now on slideshow status.  I run lots of mods ENB the works.  But I never had this issue on Windows .  I skipped  entirely on this machine.  I have  GTX s and the latest Nvidia drivers for Win.Its pretty frustrating.  I recently noticed that SLI was disabled it does that shit on its own all the time and I dont freaking know why so I enabled it.  Im going to try disabling it again and see if that is the culprit.  If that doesnt resolve it Im going to have to roll back.Skyrim aside I like  and it runs great.  Its just that if a new OS fucks with my gaming experience I have no use for it.

4778312,0,t3_3gb2xi,Ranked list. Whiterun. Its not much of a capital city but the hold is huge comprised largely of picturesque plains and the city houses the Companions the jarl who first recognized and supported the Dragonborn and its really quite peaceful once you take care of the Nazeem and Heimskr problems. . The Rift. Gorgeous scenery over a sprawling hold. It would definitely rank  if there were anyone admirable at all living in Riften besides Mjoll and her lovestruck puppy dog Aerin. But at least outside Riften youll mostly be left alone by people which is more than we can say for...  . The Reach. Markarth is the most gorgeous city in Skyrim and the rest of the hold is quite spectacular too. Which makes it a real tragedy that everyone in the hold is SO FUCKED UP. Which would you like to supportthe SilverBloods who view the Blackbriars as snotnosed upstarts in the crime world and the lovely cannibals of Markarth? Or the Forsworn bloodthirsty savages who love to party hearty with Hagravens? Theres something for everyone! Its a damn pretty place though. . Falkreath. Mostly because of Lakeview Manor and the town is mostly populated by nice quiet people. Shame about the asshole jarl though. . Haafingar. Solitude is an awesome city Proudspire Manor is the best stock home in Skyrim hands down and ElisifFalk make you feel more appreciated for your efforts than anyone else in Skyrim besides Balgruuf. The rest of the hold is unfortunately completely forgettable.. Hjaalmarch. Life sucks in Hjaalmarch but at least theyve got a pretty cool jarl. Unless the Stormcloaks win. Then its pretty much fucked.. The Pale. Dawnstar is a pretty city and theres a bit of nice scenery around. Thats about all there is to say about it thats nice. It has the same problem as.... Winterhold. I usually dislike fast traveling anywhere but will make exceptions in Winterhold and the Pale because wandering around the frozen asshole of the world occasionally fending off ice wolves is the opposite of fun. But its still less depressing than.... Eastmarch. Most of the hold is also frozen wasteland and its capital is just goddamn depressing. Ulfrics inability to outperform even the likes of Laila and Siddgeir in maintaining a city that doesnt make you hate life just standing in it is a big reason why I tend to support the Empire if only so I can take it over for myself later I am after all the goddamn Dragonborn.,skyrim,ctwuivd,6,t5_2s837

Pretty dishonourable dont know what he was expecting people to think about that but whatever.Its fair that Nords are angry about the banning of Talos worship etc. and the reasons the common stormcloak gives sound fairly noble. The problem is Ulfric who seems power hungry more than idealistic. The thalmor documents on him are ambiguous at best and then theres the speculation memorys foggy that Ulfric made things worse by bringing up the problems in the first place the rules were ignored until Ulfric made a big deal of it. I just cant bring myself to put skyrim in the hands of a character as untrustworthy etc. as Ulfric.Its not as if the Empire is siding with the Thalmor and agrees with its racial policies its just that they were attacked shortly after the oblivion crisis and forced into the unhappy situation we find it in would be a shame to make things worse and cut it off from its birthplace.Sorry thats all a bit rambling I should sleep. ,skyrim,cuu356c,0,t5_2s837

If Nexus was a pub the content creators would be breweries  you know the ones making the stuff anyone goes to the pub for in the first place. They most definitely arent just like everyone else. Besides youre acting as if this blocking of users is a oneway street. You have precisely the same power you know. If a mod author only makes mods you dont care for or if you dont like their username or think they smell wrong or have excessive body hair or whatthefuckever  you know what you can do? You can block that mod author. Yup thats right. You can block them completely unilaterally without any oversight or intervention or anything. Youre acting like the kind of guy who pines after a girl and is convinced she should be with him if only she realized how much he cares for her and loves her  because to him his feelings are all that matter and whether she loves him back is completely inconcequential. It takes two to fucking tango and it takes two people for one to make a mod and someone else to use it. So theres a mod author who doesnt like you for some reason.

5556583,0,t3_3r6wf1,I dont even know how many hours Ive sunk into this game.  The first time I played I was using my roommates copy of the game.  I know for a fact I logged about  to  hours on my first playthrough.  Back then I was playing a female Nord who sided with the Imperials.  I was basically a paladin sword and shield heavy armor restoration magic smithing and enchanting were the things I focused on.  I remember buffing my resistances to the point where I was facetanking Ancient Dragons without blocking and being so ridiculously happy about that.Anyways after losing those saves I took a hiatus then finally bought the game for myself and was instantly hooked once more.  This time I played a Breton assassin working for the Dark Brotherhood.  I also decided to mod the hell out of the game for this playthrough.  I focused on immersion and difficulty increasing mods Frostfall Wet and Cold Climates of Tamriel Cloaks of Skyrim Immersive Armors Immersive Creatures etc.  It was a whole new game!  Easily another couple hundred hours played at this point.Sadly life got in the way and I had to put the game down for quite a long while.  But several weeks ago I got itch again.  I wanted to veg out and go off the social grid for a while.  I needed a single player game that could help me clear my head.  Skyrim easily fit the bill.  This time around Im playing a Bosmer ranger wearing light armor dual wielding axes and sneaking around with a bow.  Even without any mods Im having a BLAST again.  Over  hours more and Im still loving it.  I think the point Im trying to make here is this this game is  to  years old and I cant seem to get tired of it.  Almost half a decade and Im still playing it.  I find myself stopping to take in the sights and sounds of Skyrim climbing mountains just to get a good view of the world below me and to Fus Ro Dah my followers off a cliff for shits and giggles....    I can only hope that the next Elder Scrolls game is just as immersive.  Then again I just love the cold harsh setting of Skyrim and the dragonslaying theme its got going on.  Bethesda is really going to have to raise the bar to keep me from just coming back to Skyrim again even when a new game is released.,skyrim,cwluft5,14,t5_2s837

If a player tries to kill you.  In their game they end up with a bounty on them at  septims times the level.  So a player killing another player unprovoked would likely end up in Jail for some time.  Back in their game.  So there are rules of engagement and there are rules of witnesses to the crime.  Plus if you got killed by another player you can hire Mercenaries to teach them a lesson.  This includes a note on one of the Mercenarys to let the other play know who sent them.  It follows the game mechanics.  So its not someone invading or being summoned.  They have to follow the rules of the game.   For breaking any rules ends up with a penalty.  You can even pray to the Daedra or the Aedra for swift retribution to those breaking the rules.  ,skyrim,cws377n,1,t5_2s837

5705741,0,t1_cx4bxf6,Thanks Im glad you get the idea.  Its not just stacking spells to do damage like VATS its more like casting a magical environment.  Like protection spells on some allies area slowdown spells confusion spells etc.  Not just spells but like a type of magic slowdown fire damage then a method area vs targeted then a power level.  That sort of thing.  Magic focus is a menu system that allows managing these things to make magic more strategic.  Even warrior builds could use it to cast a spell or two to help but maxed out sorcerers would use many active spells at a time.  A simple shield and damage spell combo wouldnt be enough to win a fight youd have to employ more strategic magic to help use the environment and allies to your advantage.But having this magic menu take the form of a slow time targeting not system makes a lot of sense.  Magic ought to be something you have to think about thats the point.  It could be called magical focus mode.,skyrim,cx4cpcl,5,t5_2s837

5761961,0,t1_cxbb003,Ill get a bit deeper on this.Around E  there was a battle known as Battle of Red Mountain. It was a battle part of the War of Righteousness mainly fought between the Dwemer and the Chimer The Dunmer before they were cursed by Azura Great Houses. Lore gets all weird here since every faction has their own tale.However theres some things that can be verified. Jurgen Windcaller the same one that created the Greybeards was defeated in battle he meditated after seven years after the battle and decided to create the what is now know as the Way of the Voice. Nerevar was killed.. During the battle a dwemer named Kagrenac Chief Tonal Architect used his tools Keening Sunder and Wraithguard if Im not mistaken you can get one of those in Skyrim on the Heart of Lorkhan during the battle in order for all dwemer to transcend the mortal plane. ALL the dwemer on Nirn dissapeared as he did and the Numidium showed up. Theres one dwemer left called Yagrum Bagarn and he didnt dissapear because at the time of the battle he was in an Outer Realm most likely a plane of Oblivion.,skyrim,cxbbpbn,5,t5_2s837

It would be extremely difficult to implement any type of pay system other than donations that didnt result in that kind of competition. Dont make a mistake  Valve did this so they could profit not encourage or help the modder.

6022109,0,t1_cy8xyff,To give you an opposing viewpoint My first Elder Scrolls game was Oblivion which I got via Steam on December th  because of all the hype Skyrim was getting and I hated it I thought the way the entire world scaled to your level and you could accidentally level up by running and jumping was supremely stupid to say the least.Skyrim kept getting rave reviews and I kept wanting to like TES so a couple months later I bought it for PS and and loved it.  I never bought any of the DLC though because I kept thinking I hear this modding thing is a big part of Elder Scrolls games so I should get it on PC... and around the time I hit the  hour mark I was getting a bit tired of vanilla Skyrim on PS and the Elder Scrolls Anthology was announced so I pulled the trigger on that.  That was my first experience with Morrowind so there is no nostalgia to cloud my judgement of the game and I absolutely think its better than Skyrim.That being said the two games are pretty dissimilar and I think which one you prefer depends a lot more on just what type of games youre into than which you played first if you enjoy an easier more actiony dungeon crawler with a focus on combat youll like Skyrim better and if you prefer a harder slower game more focused on exploration and story youll like Morrowind better.If you go into either game hoping its like the other youre only going to end up disappointed.,skyrim,cy90si3,2,t5_2s837

He gives free training by doing his quest. Recruit him pay for training get the money back. Rush this skill as high and as fast as you can as it helps your damage out. Theres also a marksman quest you can do. Google that for more details Always travel with a companion I prefer tank followers like lydia but ranged ones work too. Craft two summon storm atronoch staffs at the college of winterhold and give one to your follower. I cant stress how powerful these staffs are. Two storm atronochs at your level will wreck dragons on their own.Carry fortify marksman potions as well as resist fire frost and magic. magic resist and elemental resistance are calculated separately but Im not sure if the potions all stack with each other.,skyrim,cyju6d9,2,t5_2s837

You would then use alchemy smithing and enchanting to use whats called the crafting loop and create a set of armor that allows you to improve the weapon to a level far beyond its base damage.Ive personally gotten a dragonbone bow to the upper s in damage the base damage was around  and then once talents and gear came into play it rose dramtically. Factor in sneak modifier very strong fortify marksman potions and poisons elemental damage on the bow and berserker rage and I could one shot dragons on legendary at level .

Ill tell you though a top end fortify smithing potion produces results that arent just incrementally better theyre a LOT better. Ive never experimented to see what value armor I could produce with just smithingenchanting. The armor cap is somewhere between  and  depending on who you believe. So Id agree that if you can get that without alchemy then its all you need for armor. But I do know that a top end fortify smithing potion will produce a higher damage weapon than one crafted without it. Many people by preference dont do that while some do. I do it because my character seems to have a psychological need to feel invulnerable. LOL ,skyrim,cyyhpfv,2,t5_2s837

6493340,0,t1_czq0z5e,I see that posted a lot and also there is no such thing as a clean save.  I dont follow that advice myself to be honest.  My previous character was over  years old and I managed to get away with adding and removing all sorts of mods.  I did in the end have to start a new character because of a glitch I could not fix but putting myself in the position of someone just starting to mod Skyrim I think it fair to say it is like being the proverbial kid in a sweet shop.  It takes a while to find your own essential mod list and even then some will then release an update or a patch for a mod you didnt know about but now must have.  Read what other have said in the post or bug report section.  It is fair to say that when you are modding you may have to start over again.  I have had to do this several times myself and or play on with the bugs and glitches.  Once you have found the mods you want to play with it is no problem to make a backup of your save game and add a mod you want to try out.  Power game and use console to check out if you like it.  If you like it and it works as intended reload and continue if not remove and reload.  I have removed mods mid game with no apparent negative effects used a saved game cleaner to remove orphan scripts and carry on.  No I have no idea what all those scripts are doing If something breaks then I restore a previous save or start over.  Same with TesEdit learn how to clean mods which mods to clean how to make small edits to mods make your own patch and so on.  If I had subscribed to star a new game  when adding a mods I would still be in Helgan.  ,skyrim,czqyk3k,1,t5_2s837

Plus dropping power armour on you so often and so early means that anything sort of highlevel difficulties are a walkover.Im praying Obsidian get a go again at making a Fallout title as Bethesda are apparently incompetent now made even more glaringly obvious in the wake of Witcher .And who the fuck lets a guy who hates conversations and dialogue design a Fallout game?!...rant sorry.,skyrim,czy6gde,13,t5_2s837

6591883,0,t3_45u7il,I thought of doing that going back to the point before i proposed this was immediately after that whole fiasco But the thing was at the time my game was really acting up I saw a dragon that was stuck in the sky. The thing was I just did a quest that took me a really long time to do. So I was scared because of the acting up game and the long quest that something worse might happen and all my autosaves were past that point. So I just accepted it. Now her keeping the stuff doesnt really bother me its mostly  handed weapons and shields which Im not a fan of both. Anyway I kinda came up with an idea Ill move my wife Seena and my housecarl of Solitude Iona? I forgot her name and move them to Whiterun maybe something will happen probably not but doesnt hurt to try. But what bothers me is that my Thane dialogue with her is gone only whats a thane and whats a housecarl. I also forgot to mention I dont have the lets split ways option.

It makes the game x more enjoyable and on point for what an RPG should be. The combat and world dont feel generated they feel real and dangerous. It makes you slow down and begin to question your methods. I seriously urge you to try requiem and dont give up until level . Level  is very frustrating but once you get by the game explodes with possibility and a beautiful sense of self discovery as you develop your character rather than the game and quests forcing you to be The Dragonborn. ,skyrim,d09jjgu,20,t5_2s837
6675066,0,t1_d09pdc8,if you really want to be superOPOP then you can do a bunch of dwemer quests and grab as many soul gems and certain dwemer items as possible.  craft dwemer shit using the ingots you get from the dwemer metal only some can be broken down so look that up ahead of time enchant them with the soul gems and sell them off to buy alchemy ingredients.  the ingredients you will see most often in dwemer ruins are dwarven oil falmer ears and chaurus eggs.  you will find the most chaurus eggs and that is good bc they are the best afaik.  combining them with luna moth wings gives you a damage magickainvisibility potion very expensive but you can also use nirnrootcrimson nirnroot vampire dust or icewraith teeth to make regular invisibility potions.  with the dwemer oil i like to combine it with taproots since it gives you a potion with  effects but salt piles are very common and also create a  effect potion.  falmer ears combine well with troll fat but you might have more access to spider eggs skeever tails and garlic.  do all of this and you are golden nothing can kill you you will have max armor cap with any armor two superpowered enchantments per piece of gear the ability to make ridiculous potions and oneshot poisons and enough money to buy skyrim out from under the empire.,skyrim,d09rcz1,1,t5_2s837

It fails because of one very simple rule in warfare You never ever want to be defending because the defender always loses.The attacker has all the advantages. They get to choose when where and how to attack. They get to fight on their terms on terrain that suits them against a vastly outnumbered foe.How is that a rule in warfare? The defender does not always lose. The defender gets to choose what fortifications or strategic location that they choose to defend. The defender is closer to supply lines and gets to choose when to attack at opportune moments. The defender is more familiar with the surrounding terrain and typically is around a populace thats more willing to help them.

6830984,0,t3_495rk3,Real reason ghosts are NPCs all NPCs can be fed on unless bethesda makes an exception.Lore friendly reason The reason a vampire is strengthened by feeding is that by feeding the vampire draws closer to the state it was in immediately after death when it first became a vampire. A vampire that has newly fed is biologically identical to a vampire that has just been turned. By going off of blood for a while vampires can strengthen their power while their bodies rot and vampire lords can move along the spectrum of deadness freely.Warm blood contains the life force necessary to almost bring a vampire back to life and so does ectoplasm which is the life force of a ghost which is nothing but life that has been denied death.,skyrim,d0qlcbx,1,t5_2s837

6868523,0,t1_d0uq4yy,Im copypasting this comment I made on another Legion vs Stormcloak thread.I hear Stormcloaks are racist a lot but lets explore that claim shall we?Riften Many Argonians work here some at the Fishery and a couple run the Bee and Barb tavern and inn. One runs a jewelry stand. At least four Dunmer live in Riften a merchant a food vendor and a priestess or acolyte of Mara and at least one thief in the Thieves Guild. There also might be a few Dunmer who work some farms outside the city. There are no complaints made against the racial diversity by any Nord or human in Riften.Solitude There are only three named Argonians worth taking note of and they are all criminals the Blackblood Maurader pirates JareeRa and his sister Deeja both of whom you end up killing if you take up their quest and the Thieves Guild contact and fence GulumEi this doesnt paint Argonians in a very positive light in Solitude. No Dunmer were observed to live in Solitude.Windhelm There are four Argonians working the docks and by order of Ulfric they are not permitted in the city. One or two of the Argonians express resentment for their not being allowed in the city but at the other two including the only marriable female Argonian express a desire for conciliation. The player can convince their employer Torbjorn ShatterShield to increase their wages. The only Argonian follower Derkeethus can be found in the Eastmarch mining settlement Darkwater Crossing. Many Dunmer live here but are forced into a cramped and unkempted corner of Windhelm and face continual harassment from the local Nords. One of the residents of the New Gnisis Cornerclub owns a set of Imperial armor and expresses ruthless apathy regarding the serial killings of Nord women taking place in the city. Its also worth noting that even if the Legion does conquer Winterhold and in the process ending the civil war nothing changes regarding the living conditions of the Argonians or the Dunmer the Dunmer are still kept in the slum and the Argonians are still restricted from entering the city the Imperial jarl claims this is for their own good but the hard evidence is they are still barred from the city.Dawnstar There are no Argonians in Dawnstar. There is one Dunmer found in Dawnstar Erandur who is a transplant from Riften rooting out Daedric influence.Markarth There are no Argonians or Dunmer in Markarth.Morthal There is only one Argonian in the hold of Morthal and he becomes housecarl for the Stormcloak jarl. There are no Dunmer in Mortal.Whiterun No Argonians live in Whiterun. Jenassa a bloodthirsty Dunmer mercenary can be found in the Drunken Huntsman.  Balgruufs housecarl Irelith is Dunmer but seems to express more loyalty to Balgruuf than to the Empire only siding with the Legion as a proactive defense of the city she merely says Prey waits in response to Proventuss cautions.Falkreath No Argonians or Dunmer live in Falkreath.Winterhold No Argonians live in Winterhold. Some Dunmer do reside at the College which the local Stormcloaksupporting citizens and jarl distrust as an organization not due to their racial diversity but due to their potential involvement in and complete survival during the Great Collapse.All holds Khajiit are barred from entered any city no matter who is in charge at any point in the civil war.Conclusion By accident or design the initial Stormcloak holds of Riften and Windhelm are the most racially diverse holds in Skyrim. Riften is the model of racial tolerance and by tolerance I really mean no one cares what ones race happens to be so dont make a fuss over it while the circumstances of Windhelm do not change regardless of which army control of the hold at the end of the civil war.Meanwhile initial Imperial holds barely have any racial diversity at all therefore Imperials cannot campaign that they are promoting racial equality since their starting holds are void of anyone who would benefit from such equality and even when they have opportunities to make a difference inviting Khajiit into the city improving the lives of Dunmer and Argonians in Windhelm they are seemingly content to permit the status quo of racism to continue and are therefore no better than the Stormcloaks.,skyrim,d0uuwdg,21,t5_2s837

6996710,0,t1_d19em4t,If you are playing a mage check out the college of mages in winterhold. Its a good quest line that gives good gear and you can buy most spells there. The greybeards will lead you on the main questline. The civil war will have you choose to fight for the stormcloaks or the empire. The storm cloaks are meant to be rebels and the empire obviously the empire. They both have valid beliefs though and they both want wants best for skyrim just in different ways so the choice is pretty good either way. I would recommend that story line. Im guessing you got the dragonborn and dawnguard DLCs? If so the dawnguard allows you to be a vampire or hunt vampires. Vampires tie in well with a mage i find. Dragonborn i would wait until after completeing the main questline been so long i cant remember but i think you actually have to before you can start it. And if you choose not to be a vampire you can join the companions and become a werewolf im not a big fan of werewolf play and would take vamp over itcan only have one. Dark brotherhood is assassins and it is fun but for the RP factor not as fun as a mage. Each Jarl i believe has their own little side questline...Lots to do! ,skyrim,d19f56n,1,t5_2s837

7029631,0,t1_d1czcy4,I believed this too until I reread the dossier a few days ago. It explicitly states that contact between the thalmor ambassador and ulfric has been established since her arrival in skyrim. It also says further contact will be difficult but possible if necessary. They are pen pals. Combine that with the fact that the thalmor ambassador to skyrim is the very same one who tortured ulfric during the war and its pretty clear to me that shes got him on a leash. Hes been brainwashed hes not just an unwitting pawn but a sleeper agent.Furthermore part of the mental torture he was put under while captured during the way was that he was convinced the imperial city fell because of Intel he provided. He actually believes its his fault the empire lost the way. Does this fit the stormcloak motives? They fight because the empire was too weak yet their leader believes it was his own weakness that caused the empire to fall.He was unnotable in the war. Just a jarls nephew with a power he was too terrified to use. He returned a hero and was made yarl when his uncle passed. Not only is his release all too convenient but he doesnt even believe in the ideology his faction is fighting for. Ulfric is weak and leading his followers to ruin.Even if one were to believe Ulfric could triumph over the empire and the thalmor his empire would be as short lived as any that occurred before tiber septim united tamriel. The strength of the septim empire was the unity of the many people from different regions. Ulfrics policies and rhetoric are filled with racism and segregation. Were he able to conquer morrowind elsewyre valenwood and summerset isle those provinces would inevitably form a new dominion and rebel again and again.The only hope of salvaging a future for humanity is as follows reveal Ulfric to the Nordic people as a fraud killing him isnt sufficient it would only create a martyr. As a last resort this is probably the thalmors plan to extend the war. Gather all the surviving blades to start a gurilla campaign against the thalmor. The purpose isnt to strike for effect its to do something the blades havnt been good at in the past. Be visible. They are the heros of the old empire the people of tamriel believe they are gone and with them the emperors eyes and ears. The current imperial leadership is indeed too weak. The dragonborn needs just one thing to overthrow them and push the thalmor from cyroldiil... Find the amulet of kings. This isnt the first time the amulet has been lost to history. Akatosh showed Tiber Septim where to find it history may yet repeat itself.,skyrim,d1d5v8l,11,t5_2s837

7069908,0,t3_4cebj2,Um. My current character wears heavy armor but relies on alteration to buff the armor skill conjuration to summon atronachs and dremora lords for sniffing out weakness. Alchemy to produce potions for sale and occasionally use enchanting to get my gear to reduce cost of casting as well as other nice things to have muffle disease resist. Destruction is not used much and illusion is starting to find a place as I learn to use it.Currently at  magic resist Alteration perk Magic Resist  agent of Mara and being a Breton. My conjuration is at  so I cant quite dual cast my friendlies. Also working on restoration for the Recovery  perks. My character carries  weapons. A pick axe a wood axe and an iron dagger I roll play as needing a knife as a tool not a weapon.Tips ... hm. Raise conjuration as fast as you can by training yourself with soul trap and a dead enemy. Raise your alteration by getting ahold of telekenesis and locking yourself in a room with a book. You can train restoration by going in and out of the wind between High Horathgar and Paarthurnax and then healing yourself. These arent exploits in my opinion. I wish Bethesda created a way to train all of your skills outside of combat. The only downside to a mage character is that you are constantly switching between spells.

Heres a short rundown of how it wentI was ordered to patrol the streets at night. I did that nothing happened the whole night until dawn I saw Calixto running like crazy into his house. I couldnt find anything suspicious and the guards where also relaxed so I followed him into his house to speak to him. He wasnt very talkative at this moment I opened up this thread so I wasnt quite sure what to do. Sheogorath aka Google whispered to me I have to kill him hes the murderer. I really wasnt quite sure this man didnt do anything to me and I liked him a bit the old adventurer he was. So one night later I wanted to give him one last chance to tell me whats going on. To my surprise he was inside Hjerim that house where I once found that necromancy shrine... I sneaked in and I was petrified seeing him how he was busy with some corpses. As I stepped outside the shadows he saw me immediately draw his dagger to attack me and the rest is history. Thats what you get for believing in the good of strangers. May his soul be cursed he got what he deserved.Edit Ah and I didnt take any special care of that amulet but it reveald itself as the necromancer artifact. I will hold on to it to remember that old bastard.,skyrim,d2eolgp,2,t5_2s837

7540018,0,t3_4ijvi6,Riften is tough.  All that water tries to render pretty like even though you arent near it or looking at it.  Blaming consoles is fun but really the issue is that Bethesda makes games compatible for other systems first then ports over to PS and they just arent very good at getting the most out of the systemoptimizing performance.  They arent especially great at programming on PC either but the modding community is enthusiastic enough to pick up their considerable slack and move on rather than hold them accountable for reams of spaghetti code.My advice to you turn off all autosaves.  All of them.  Especially the autosave on travel.  Clear the cache of saves that are too far back for you to return.  Load screens will be  shorter FPS will be much higher and everything renders nicer.  The game works fine for me at level  with most of the main continent explored and conquered with the exception of player homes which have been acting erratic to say the least.  As long as your total number of followers is less than four and multiple dragons dont attack you should be able to muscle through the rest of the game.  And save manually unless you want the game to take on a dark souls quality.,skyrim,d2z9hxd,1,t5_2s837

7861041,0,t1_d3zmlpg,Its certainly viable just clunky.  I guess my point is that skyrim and the TES series in general has never been very mechanically driven the gameplay and its mechanics serves as the necessary medium to further the players involvement in the story and does well enough to make the player feel like they are the dragonbornchampionnerevarine in this expansive world experiencing rich stories and amazing lore.But why cant it have that engaging story driven gameplay while also having fluid combat that feels visceral and never breaks the flow of battle.Witcher  is a prime example of what Im talking about.  The story narrative and lore are excellent and the gameplay mechanics that support the players progression through it are well realized to really make you feel like you are Geralt the Witcher as you fight through the game in your own way.Im not saying make skyrim play like the Witcher but that Bethesda could certainly take a few pointers from how that sandbox handled player interaction.,skyrim,d3znhag,5,t5_2s837

Load up a save and try to break the mod in any way possible. Test its limits. See if its too buggy to use. Play the game normally but going out of your way to use the mod. Do this for a day or two of playing at least. Choose now whether to keep the mod. Does it feel stable? Have you noticed any awful bugs? If you experienced too many issues scrap it and scrap the saves with it. You have the one right before installation. Rinse and repeat.This lets me play and test mods simultaneously.

At  you can pickpocket equipped weapons disarming enemies before you fight them just in case they survive the stab to the back youre about to deliver and at  you can steal equipped armor. Another use thats definitely an exploit and not intended is that you can put stolen items in a bandits pockets then kill the bandit and the items will no longer be flagged as stolen when you go to loot them.Best way to level it is to sneak up behind a bandit and put lightweight items in his inventory then steal them back out until you get caught.

Ditch Climates of Tamriel for it. Try it with and without Enhanced Light and FX if you want I prefer it without. The aMidianBorn series Book of Silence Caves and Dungeons and Landscape Skyrim HD K textures for everything aMidianBorn doesnt cover. These are a bit better than the Bethesda hires and wont have a performance hit.And most important a correctly configured ENBoost That will do wonders for your system and prevent you from taking too much of a performance hit with these mods.

8066564,0,t3_4poogy,I see this posted over this board every once in a while and while a good question it kind of leans to one side doesnt it? Implying theres less worth in being born good. Not trying to get too off topic but Im no longer with any church because of this mentality in a way. Not saying thats a good or bad thing or whatever but when my brother was wanting to be baptised his choice the church didnt let him because he didnt have a spiritual discovery essentially saying you havent fucked up youre life enough to be forgiven by God. Like wtf.How that relates to this quote is by looking at its syntax. Is it better to be born good or to be born evil and struggle to be good? Is redemption worth more than being a decent human being to begin with? Or should we assume the nature of every creature is evil and that good is something you cant be born with? Because we all have struggles with different vices etc. But then what does that day about the born good. Those who didnt indulge in evil when they could and be redeemed? Are they to be less respected than those who were evil by choice and then choose to be good? Maybe thats why this is a compelling question but it still makes me think of those who would use this to justify being an asshole as long as they say sorry after rather than just not being an asshole in the first place.This did get off topicEdit was going to address some of the similar topics that were brought up but they do vary a bit so Ill respond to each in kind.

8173559,0,t3_4r8chx,Sjorri IronSky is a Nord and Talos devotee. Shes not deeply versed in Elvish cosmology but strongly believes the Thalmor have no good intentions with regard to humanity and the prohibition of the worship of Talos is proof of that. Like Heimskr says in Whiterun share the heavens with us? They barely tolerate our presence on earth. Though shes not one of those Skyrim for the Nords types she strongly believes that a prolonged civil war ultimately benefits the Thalmor and a strong Skyrim is more likely to throw off the yoke of the WhiteGold Concordat and the Thalmor than a compromised Empire.In fact she was on her way to make contact with Stormcloak forces when she was captured along with Ulfric and company near Dark Water Crossing.

8247274,0,t1_d58fmnf,I like to roleplay as certain characters in the game. Like go full out immersion. I like watching Rycon Roleplays  for ideas of new characters to be and just how to make in game be like more real life.Be different characterspeople. Play as if everything you do is real life. Ive done a lot of play throughs. Most of them end up just be finishing one quest line like the Thieves Guild quest line and then just deleting that save and starting over as somethingsomeone like someone who was stranded from a shipwreck who has to make their way back up in the world because everything that they know and owned was on that ship.Another one I liked doing was using the Alternate Start  mod and selecting the option of Attacked and being left to die. I make the scenario up before I start playing. My most memorable and fun one that I remember went something like this. I was a child who had their parents killed by an assassin from the Dark Brotherhood on the road somewhere. My family was of royal blood so now that I am the sole survivor of that family and a child I usually played as a female Breton around the age of  and I found the black hand of the Dark Brotherhood on my parents bodies and I told myself that I would avenge them. So I went about training myself in the ways of stealth and silent killing without doing the Dark Brotherhood quest line or Thieves Guild line either. When I felt that I was good enough to take on The Brotherhood I began the Brotherhood questline. I killed Astrid in the shack and let the three prisoners go. I then made my way to the Penitus Oculatus Outpost to let them know I killed Astrid. I then made my way to the Falkreath Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary and killed all of the assassins in there. I planned it out that Veezara  was the assassin that killed my parents and I gave him a slow and agonizing death. After my vengeance was complete. I went about killing all those I thought were connected to the Dark Brotherhood. I made the Penitus Oculatus an enemy by thinking that they were secretly funding the Brotherhood so I killed them all as well. Basically I made my way up to killing the Jarl of Solitude because she allowed the Brotherhood to continue their operations. That was before I killed them all.Basically just make up a character with a story behind himher and go with it until you feel that that characters story is complete. Then end that chapter and start a new one. Thats my advice. Sorry for the wall of text.,skyrim,d58gqum,8,t5_2s837

Youve got the Eye of Magnus completely unique in lore the Psijics incredibly ominous warnings the Staff of Magnus and the Augur of Dunlain... and all of it leads literally nowhere. Just yeah resolved now. What even happened? Who the hell knows. I think the original plot was more or less what SnapeSev said. You are directly or indirectly responsible for either preventing or causing the the Great Collapse. The Eye of Magnus somehow fits into this obviously as a catalyst of some sort and maybe the cause itself of the time travelcollapse. But Bethesda rushed the questline and it might as well not exist because nothing happens in it.As a result of Bethesdas negligence people are tinfoiling whatever they can to make sense of all of it.

8410701,0,t3_4uubdx,gt A chance to continue the story of the Dragonborn would be amazing rather than another long jump into the future. If certain aspects of the previous save game could be imported it could make for a very different and compelling instalment into the Elder Scrolls series.No not really. Theyd need to do something really tiresome like arrange for the DB to get banged over the head and mugged so that heshe lost all equipment and experience. Which would defeat the entire point of the exercise.On the other hand if you keep the gear and experience then everything you encounter needs to be scaled up to maintain the challenge. So the first enemies are going to be Elite Thalmor Guards any single one of whom could have beaten Alduin blindfolded and with one hand tied behind their back while simultaneously talking to their mum on a mobile and trying to explain why just because they forgot her birthday that doesnt mean they dont love her. Then we get the Extra Super Heavy Stormcloak Troopers who are even tougher. The only reason they didnt kill Alduin was that they were waiting for their nail varnish to dry that day. And it just gets worse from there. All these new threats start out with dragonbone gear and then they introduce a load of new really good stuff to the point where it quickly becomes apparent that all the stuff we got excited about in Skyrim I was just toys for the kiddies ... Dont believe me? Fire up Morrowind and look at the Bloodmoon expansion. Your character the Nerevarine has killed living gods. Quite possibly with his bare hands. But he visits the island of Solstheim and because Beth are dead excited by being having worked out how to do animals with fur the place is full of wolves bears and boars. With the result that your godkilling character from the previous installments goes there and promptly gets his ass handed to him by a pig. And when that happens you realize that all the things you did before that you thought made you so tough all they had to do was get a Solstheim farmgirl to herd three pigs through the Ghostgate and the problem would have solved itself.Really its a bad idea.,skyrim,d5svrgl,7,t5_2s837

8426826,0,t1_d5uvrmg,I agree except I liked Balgruuf and I felt like there was enough interaction with him to make him a meaningful character.You interact with him...multiple times over the first dragon.for the use of Dragonsreach.during the civil war. regarding his son.to become Thane.There should be more NPCs with at least this much involvement. Now I agree in a good hub town youd probably have a more important character like Ulfric in there too. Ulfric is underused if anything. It actually makes more sense for him to be the one that you first go to after the Dragon attacks since he was actually a student of the Greybeards. You and he could form a bond over the voice. Imagine escaping with him hiding out in Riverwood for a bit and then helping him get home to Windhelm. Then he sends you after the Dragon because he knows your skills. You discover youre Dragonborn and he helps you find the Greybeards and names you a brother when you return after the trials.Im guessing the main reason they didnt do that is that they didnt have a good counterweight to make you consider betraying him to join the Imperials if you were that involved with him.,skyrim,d5uw7wt,2,t5_2s837

8452915,0,t1_d5y48rv,Kinda incorrect. Sure the world is mostly leveled but if you are facing Alduin at early levels you wont have a high amount of hp and probably wont have any magicelemental resistance so he will be deadly. At higher levels acquiring those things are easier and only Alduins level and thus hpmagickastamina changes his damage stays the same so he will be easier to deal with.Same with generic enemies too. Most bandits get their strongest when you are at around level  since they get a lot of perks that will give them an advantage over you. But after level  they will be easily dispatched.So I would say if he wants to avoid an anticlimactic end with Alduin at least on Throat of the World he should do it at around level . Or maybe up the difficulty and do it around level .,skyrim,d5y5f5b,5,t5_2s837

Hammerfell or everything else?Thats my whole point I dont think the everything else was a foregone conclusion.gtThe Thalmor are kind of superficially fascist with the black robes and the obvious racism thats really a cover for their bizarre religious views but the Stormcloaks bear a much closer resemblance to actual fascist movements. You describe them as nationalist but thats not really a coincidence  fascism is the result of nationalism taken to its ultimate conclusionI fully reject the notion that nationalism  fascism and there are many historical examples of such and I even listed one. Heck the fall of th century empires is because of nationalist movements that did not devolve into fascism the decay of Hapsburg Austria being the best example.Im not sure how you can really argue racial purity is superficially Nazi  it was a core tenet.gtThe attitude the Stormcloaks have toward the WhiteGold Concordat is that the Medes were weak fools who surrendered to a beaten enemy because they cant comprehend the idea that the Red Ring was a Pyrrhic victory.I agree this isnt a very good objective view on their part. Shades of grey appearing yet again. Remember my whole point here is both sides have a point not that the Stormcloaks areright and the Empire is wrong.gtHonestly I dont really understand this attitude. The WhiteGold Concordat sold out Hammerfell yes but it saved Cyrodiil Skyrim and High Rock. This is assuming the premise that Im disagreeing with that the WGC actually accomplished this.

8488318,0,t3_4vxbnc,I had several mods including the mod for Dark Brotherhood Forever plus a mod that let me have multiple followers.  Outside Riften I found my mark but decided to have some fun and cast frenzy on the guard who attacked and killed my mark then turned on my Marcurio Cicero and Spectral Assassin.His fellow guards attacked him just in time for my original mark to spawn a freaking Dragon Priest in the plot twist for the mod.  For some reason this aggros on the guards but not on my followers.  The Dragon Priest casts one half hearted spell on the guards then inexplicably turns tail and runs over the hillside guards following me following the guards my followers trailling behind.  We find the Dragon Priest taking out a random skeever then running from the guards again only to take on a random wolf pack.He runs a third time.  My non aggroed followers are just making small talk about Matthew Bellemont and singing songs.  None if this interests them as they trail behind me as I follow the guards.  We have run for a good five minutes at this point until the Dragon Priest hits an unclimbable mountain and decides to make his stand  taking on a dozen guards.  Im standing back and watching when I hear a familiar noise and look up to see a troll on the mountain above barreling down on a bear.  The duel fights happen for a moment until the troll knocks the bear off the cliff to his death then jumps down after him.  The Dragon Priest now finds himself fighting both guard and troll and falls in battle.  At this point my followers finally become interested in the situation and attack the troll finally killing it.The sole survivor is a lone guard who tells me not to lollygag.  I reverse pickpocket some gems to him for a job well done but take his uniform for the attitude.

I guess I like how youre not a destined hero with special powers but thats really it.But uhhh despite that Oblivion is still a really really good game. When I say the quests are better I mean theyre way better. More investigation more talking better paced some of them you can kind of fuck up and fail which is nice. So yeah enjoy it. Only advice would be that dont be afraid to mess with the difficulty slider Oblivions balancing is kind of borked.

8767787,0,t1_d70vnlw,So I installed the High King of Skyrim mod.  Now one of the requirements to become High King is that you kill both Elisif and Ulfric so there is no one with a better claim.  Now I killed Ulfric throughout the course of the civil war filthy rebel but Elisif was standing in the way of my Vampire Lord Destructionspecced Archmage ascending the throne.  And nothing I could do could kill her even turning her off of essential.  Then I realized that I could marry her.  That would be how I claimed the throne.  I would marry the widow of the former High King.  I courted her and eventually married her. Not long after I staked my claim to the throne.  Now I was still rather annoyed with her.  I spent quite a long time plotting her destruction and trying to kill her.  I wasnt going to be defeated by her!As High King I gained the privilege of being able to summarily execute anyone that I want.  So the night we moved into the new castle I sentenced her to death.  The very next morning she was beheaded.  I took her head and displayed it in my throne room as a warning to all those that refused to die when I wanted to kill them.,skyrim,d71mxtu,8,t5_2s837

8789791,0,t3_50gxb1,What worked so well in Morrowind and was lacking in Oblivion and Skyrim is the fact that you arent sure what you are for most of  the game. Furthermore when you learn of the prophecy and the nerevarine you spend a massive portion of the game proving that you are indeed the fulfillment of that prophecy and traveling around the game world making the requirements fall into place.Once youve accomplished that you STILL have the option in conversation with Dagoth Ur to reject the prophecy and view yourself as an individual not destined for anything  just acting on what you thought was right. The game provides you with plenty of narrative opportunity to cast off the prophecy as coincidence Oh you are immune to corprus because some whacked out Telvanni in a big mushroom helped you out. It would seem you are indeed a part of the prophecy despite that considering Azura comes to you afterwards and speaks this would lead many to believe there was some divine selection here. But what was so great was that it took hours of gameplay for most to actually feel like you were something greater than the rest of the weird world you stumbled into.One hour into skyrim and oblivion you are the chosen one and everyone is in agreement. It just lacks depth as wide as an ocean but as shallow as a pond.I definitely want the next game to continue the trope of the pardonedprisoner who has been divinely selected to carry out the writings of a prophecy but I would love to see more subtlety and skepticism. I want to be conflicted about the game world and the prophecy itself. In Morrowind the death of Nerevar in lore is still up for debate. Did Dagoth Ur go mad and slay him? Did the tribunal turn on Nerevar because he refused to tap into the power of the heart? Dagoth Ur is certainly evil now but is he in some ways a victim? In a different timeline could he have been good? The game leaves you to ponder on so many of the happenings.In Oblivion Dagon is bad hes gonna do bad stuff and so are the mythic dawn. Gotta get Martin on the throne so oblivion which is bad stops attacking the good stuff.In Skyrim Alduin the world eater is back and hes gonna eat all our souls. We gotta stop him. Oh you can kill dragons you better kill Alduin. Theres this civil war going on but whatever.There was a lot of room for skepticism story telling and questionable narrators a GREAT part of any story in both of those games that were lost for what I am guessing are many reasons. I want them to step it up for the next game. ,skyrim,d74edk0,2,t5_2s837

8934581,0,t3_52i4u7,This was very similar to Morrowind for me. I didnt play Oblivion until a month and a half before Skyrim launched because I was still busy fulfilling the Nevarine Prophecy Im still unsure if I have ever beaten Morrowinds main storyline I usually split my video game time between one good shooter whichever Madden is current and an RPG. TES saves me so much money because I usually dont have to go out and get new game after new game I can invest my time in a well thought out universe I really enjoy and build characters with fun fighting styles. I actually felt that Skyrim left less choice in how to play there was less of the choice in who I wanted to be as a combatant. Spellmaking previously a very fun part of playing a mage had been removed and the spellbook had been cut down. My favorite school of magic mysticysm had been eliminated and dumped into the alteration skill tree. Conjuration was a shell of its old self and Destruction had been crippled at least on the surface. As I got to know the game better I found out it was give and take.I had always played the same breed of character before a nightblade basically a sneaky mage. I was klepto and robbed everyone blind just to sell it all. I rarely pulled out a weapon because in Morrowind the skill progression for combat was more difficult at lower skill levels. You had to build your class to give you a hand up just to train things properly. If you sucked at swordsmanship to begin with the grind was unreal just to get it started moving. The same for any combat skill or magic skill you kind of had to be whoever you decided to be at the beginning of the game in Morrowind because changing up your main skill set late game was suicide. Oblivion was similar although offered more freedom to try and do everything but once I got to know Skyrims playstyle better I realized that it opened the door for a more universal playstyle. You could do anything at anypoint in the game at least to a degree effectively. Even picking Master locks only ever took a couple tries at the lowest level you could be. That plus while the magic classes had been nerfed the combat gameplay had really taken a ton of steps foreward. I started playing more sword and board classes cutting my way through armies instead of stealthily taking them out one by one using cunning and spellcasting. Eventually I learned even more about skyrims new levelling ways and how to survive and was able to find a new ground I had never used before where I would use conjured weapons distract with mage lights detect life and dead to know where my enemies were sneak in with muffled feet and invisibility and attack with bound swords. I was blending multiple schools into one seamless attack and skyrim offered that ability more than any other game so far.Each elder scrolls game is new and different and while we all have a favorite one we need to enjoy what each on brings because at the end of the day these games are meant to entertain and be fun to play. Even if they do completely botch spellcasting.,skyrim,d7lsz0r,1,t5_2s837
8939485,0,t3_52qhuw,From a gameplay and plot perspective I think youd enjoy Skyrim a bit more. As mentioned there indeed are plenty of walk ineff shit upwalk out quests but there are plenty of fleshed out interesting things to do as well.Skyrim seems a bit more populated and vibrant than F but not by leaps and bounds. To me at least.The real dealbreaker for me with F was how the main characters voiceover destroys roleplaying a feature Skyrim of course does not have thank god. For me Skyrim is dozens of different games in one depending on the endless amount of motivations backstories and play styles you can come up with.And its JUST. HUGE. I just started a new playthrough to finally get through the DLCs Ive never finished. I havent even reached the DLCs yet and Im already finding quests Id never found before after playing this thing for  years. Unless  is a killer for you Id take the risk.,skyrim,d7me73w,1,t5_2s837

Theres something to be said about invested time and effort vs payoff but since the payoff cant possible be akin to a reallife  mile walk which at best youre only ever going to want to do once in the game and then never again theres just no way its going to work out as an inescapable mechanic. People are going to fast travel even more and feel completely disconnected from the world because they dont explore  of it which they also know contains nothing of interest or is just too vast to explore for the occasional event.

Skyrim already has all the Empires problems and continues to have them while in the Empire after seceding they would no longer be constrained by the WhiteGold Concordant and could evict the Thalmor from their land. The Dominion like the Empire is still recovering from the Great War so theres likely little they could do about losing their influence in Skyrim.The Empire is certainly not at its height and certainly does not control most of Tamriel. Summerset Valenwood and Elsweyr are now the Dominion. Black Marsh left the Empire taking half of Morrowind with it and the rest of Morrowind is on the verge of seceding with antiImperial sentiments so high that House Hlaalu was stripped of its position as a Great House and most of the province is still devastated from the Red Year. Hammerfell was backstabbed by the Empire and Skyrim is in the midst of Civil War. So the great and mighty Third Empire of Man only has a firm grip on two whole provinces High Rock which is historically prone to infighting and Cyrodiil which no matter how important it may be the Empire cant defend anyway.,skyrim,d83nwq2,2,t5_2s837

If you spam them enough and if you have the Impact perk too theyll be potentially more effective than archery. Lightning storm is also the ultimate dragon killer.Illusion is a fun school if you like sitting back and watching enemies kills themselves but otherwise if you dont know how to abuse perk point glitches or simply dont have the patience to level that too Destruction and Conjuration specifically focusing on daedra instead of bound weapons or the undead will suffice.,skyrim,d8pp5qp,3,t5_2s837

Bsa files are very similar to esp as they work like a package but they can contain rd party assets meaning stuff created by the community and not Bethesda so you couldnt find them in the base game. Loose files are just unpackaged files and assets which wont be able to be used on XB unless converted to a bsa file correct me if Im wrong though in some cases is impossible so please understand that some mods wont be available to either PS or XB.

Basically users can sell keys to them but GA doesnt actually care if these keys are stolen. Customers can buy insurance in case the key they get turns out to be stolen and gets deactivated but that only stops half the damage. If keys are bought with stolen credit cards the owners of the cards will inevitably find out and cancel the charge. This can lead to the original sellers often indie developers getting tons of chargebacks.I just noticed I misread your first comment. You already know that GA sells stolen keys.

Daggers are lightweight letting smart thief to acquire more goods. Swords are heavy and slow not good for Khajiit with quick feet! Khajiit also deals greater bonus damage when sneak attacking with daggers. If you are spotted either become invisible with potions or illusions run in the shadows or if the situation makes it impossible to hide use your legs or risk in becoming decorative rug!However Khajiit recommends this instead Find a gauntlet that fortifies unnarmed combat... This one persuaded Gian the Fist in the ratway to give away his gloves. Disenchanting them and putting that enchatment on heavy armor gauntlets works wonders for Khajiit.

Will fanboys have the balls to admit that? Probably not.I will never understand fanboyism and the lack of critical thinking. I have loads of games that I love but I will openly admit flaws in them.

Highlight the game and press options to get the menu for checking for update and other options.Also mods do disable achievements.Another note I installed just two mods and they were nothing major and the game would CTD in starting a new game after it ran for a few.

9460229,0,t3_59nudz,Ive been playing for a few years now off and on and only got to level . I just had to start a brand new game this week due to profile problems so i feel like a newb all over again but this time I made a point of buying Breezehome within the first  hours and hoarding everything I could get my hands on.  Im holding off on as many quests as I can until I can get like g and really focusing on saving my followers. Fucking Lydia kept dying at the frost troll until i parked her ass downhill. Did you know she just fucking concedes and bows and the frost troll just leaves her alone? Wheres that benefit to me?? IMHO the only two houses you need are breezehome and the arch mage quarters. I dont even use the other ones because its a pain to go between homes. Whiterun has everything you need in town and arch mage is easy and quick to get and also a mages dream. Im glad Im starting over again and fixing stupid mistakes I did the first time while learning but its also so tedious and boring to go through everything again. Theres no right or wrong way to play  just enjoy it and explore! Theres ALWAYS going to be more time to do things later. You dont have to do every quest but you can if you want.

DrinkingFortify OneHandedpotions using Fortify OneHanded enchantments smithing weapons to legendary level and multiplying their damage by  orsneakattacking which can increase attack power by x doesnt increase the skill. Also since these methods damage the target faster using these is not advised while increasing OneHanded skill.

Staves and potions can help you with magicka problems and later on you can get Archmage Robes to reduce spell costs or enchant your own spell cost reduction gear.  I recommend against reducing spell cost to zero.There are many ways to build a mage.Breton starts with a conjure familiar spell so perhaps you want your early focus to be on conjuration.  Chose either the atronach or necromancy tree not both.Start off with choosing one elemental destruction path.  Remember you initially have limited perk points.  Get the Impact perk.Frost Atronachs make good tanks and you can use the ice storm spell well with them.Illusion needs to be fully perked to stay effective and it is a powerful school.  But no illusion spell can effect a dragon.Alteration provides flesh spells for defence magic resistance perks and utility spells.  As a Breton if you grab the resistance perks and atronach and do the Book of Love quest you can laugh at dragon breath and enemy spells. And paralyze spell is nice.Restoration provides magicka regeneration perks and healing.As you build your mage do not level all skills at an equal pace or your spells will be too weak. You can develop all mage skills but not all at the same pace.,skyrim,d9kqe8r,3,t5_2s837

We had been travelling from dawnstar to solitude when we had been ambushed by bandits they showed no mercy even when my parents gave them everything they had. They slaughtered them took all our belongings and left laughing as if my parents deaths were hilarious. I am fortunate that I was not seen who knows what they wouldve done to me.After that my nord parents found me. They took me to their home in Falkreath and raised me as their own I will always be grateful and would do anything for them.

Easy to drink but has enough flavor to be interesting.

Special edition runs on a  bit engine and uses Direct X  so it looks better and you can have more mods however you cant use Skyrim Script Extender so there are a large number of older mods you cant use including the amazing Skyui thou I heard there might be a way to force it to work with SE.

The one ring with a random chance of making me invisible when I cast spells with it on is fun.Next Ordinator. Spooky Mr Skeleton warriors are fun as my version of Saurons orcs.Extensible Follower Framework is good for groups of my lieutenants and lets me teach them spells. The idea is to ensure every member of my army has at least the raise zombie spell so that whenever an enemy falls they get back up to serve me.First person camera mod. Means I actually have a torso I can look down at in first person and first person broomstick.Flyable broomstick mod. Useful.That technicolour extra ingredients mod adds duplicates of some ingredients like white deathbell with same effects. Good for alchemy.Apocalypse.Lost Grimoire.Thunderchild even if youre not the Dragonborn out of character picking up new shouts and roleplaying them as spells is really really cool.Mod to prevent zombies turning into ash on death so you can drag one favourite zombie around if you want right from the start.Aurora standing stones makes ritual stone randomly raise zombies near you on its own and as a Breton using racemenus options to have pointy ears with Imperious races adds an extra ability.Oh and Undeath so at Level  she just straight up becomes a lich. once I get around to there and do the quest.Still unsure on house mods or clothes currently going with black Tribunal Robes with the white mask as her incognito outfit for dark deeds but day to day she wears vanilla ebony armour with a daedric crown from that helmet crowns mod gives a sort of black knight meets Maleficent vibe.Theres also a aemors sanctum mod I recently found that connects all the major holds and buildings with a network of mysterious tunnels and dwemer runehidden disappearing reappearing doors. Im currently trying it out but am finding my game crashes at a moments notice in it and its not navmeshed to my knowledge.House wise there was a witch cottage mod in Falkreath that while it crashes a lot it does have a cool cauldron as the crafting station for everything.,skyrim,da1809r,1,t5_2s837

On legendary difficulty where enemies are sponges it makes it really hard to use efficiently as a standalone source of damage. Enemies resistant to magic become a nightmare and is generally hard to use because you dont get any advantages like other offensive skill trees offer e.g. the enemy diversion of conjuration the ease of use and huge damage on melee and archery the tankiness of a full armor warrior build the access to almost overpowered enchantments and special weapon effects the relative safety of a maxed out sneak build etc..Its definitely fun to use though and I wish I was better at using Destruction effectively. ,skyrim,da2z2ni,1,t5_2s837

9718718,0,t3_5eb8jj,Draugr are  resistant along with all other undead including skeletons vampires etc. About half of all bandits in the game are Nords which also have that  resistance. Dragons I believe resist all spells and giants and mammoths and most other animals have some degree of frost resist.So pretty much everything in the game resists it. Its main function is slowing enemies down so much that they cant reach you but with the Impact perk any spell can handle that. It is inferior to the other types of magic but its not totally unusable especially if you pair it with some kind of melee and use the cloak spells.,skyrim,dab1k2l,2,t5_2s837

9786345,0,t1_daizupw,Ive always looked at the Thieves Guild in Skyrim as professional thieves. There are quests I have to alter business ledgers in shops so the easiest way to do that is breaking into someplace at night and being stealthy to do it. It also requires a bit of pickpocketing which has to do with stealth essentially breaking into someones pocket and taking what they own. If a guard caught me doing that Id have to pay them off because well its a crime.  I have to go and burn down crops in order to shake clients. All of this sounds like criminal action to me. And I always felt like I was doing the dirty work for businesses. In Skyrim I am a thief. I may take it further than the TG do but Im nonetheless a thief that has the skills to do very well in the guild. I feel like their protection rackets are just a selling point. Its so they dont just look like criminals but they have a mission. A guild or faction needs some type of goal or mission so I agree that theyre not just criminals. However I do think theyre partly criminals. If you have high stealth high pickpocketing and high lock picking then the TG is easy. ,skyrim,dajdozo,1,t5_2s837

At the Greybeard peace council the Empire demands that the Stormcloaks pay for a massacre they allegedly committed at Karthwasten. The Empires accusation is supported by the fact that Ulfric can be convinced to agree to pay for it.

9892261,0,t1_dawcmj8,It does feel more natural and youll see that you kind of create your own quests out of things you need to do in a given area. Personally this is nerdy but... I write down bullet point lists of the things I need to do and plan out trips. LikeRiften  train smithing  return ingredients to blackbriar girl  talk to MjollWindhelm  deliver crown to ulfricWinterhold  do something elseIts like youre travelling the land accomplishing things as you go by. Above is an abbreviated example usually Ill have several tasks in an area before I go there. Often times things on my list arent quest items at all but things I want to do like get training return ingredients amp loot back home. Thats why I said above that the quests become yours. ,skyrim,dawzgrx,6,t5_2s837

9894553,0,t1_dax0hb0,gtAmusingly the empire will install Maven as new Jarl of Riften after taking the city. I guess the empire really is as corrupt as the Stormcloaks say.More likely they are just stretched so thin that they dont have time for a formal investigation to discover her corruption. They just know that she is the second most powerful person in the town owns a large amount of property and already knows how to manage it all. The Empire has its heart in the right place  they want to unify the provinces to avoid crushing defeat at the hands of the Thalmor who very obviously do intend to eventually expand again  but they have so few resources that theyre left to the use of barons and despots to maintain local order.Whenever you get into a proper dialogue with some of the named Imperial characters most of them reveal that more than anything they are just simply terrified of the threat of the Thalmor and they can see the Stormcloak rebellion dividing the Empire such that the elves stand a very real chance of taking over entirely and enacting a genocide. They regard the Stormcloaks with such annoyance and malice because to them Ulfric and his armies are enacting the will of the Thalmor even without knowing it. However the Empire also has the added disadvantage of having to please the Elven dignitaries or risk defeat before they even have the chance to bolster their forces in a real defense.It would be like having elements within the French Resistance of WW constantly trying to fracture the movement over which type of wine is better all while the people at the forefront are doing their best to remain undetected by the Germans. While the worship of Talos is noble and youll find many Imperial citizens who still hold reverence for it its a secondary consideration next to survival itself.,skyrim,daxa84z,5,t5_2s837

However at the time of TESSkyrim the Imperials had just lost a war to the Thalmor who like to pretend that theyre the children of aedra. Accepting the birth of a new aedra so late in history shatters this narrative so when the Thalmor won the war they imposed this policy onto the Imperials. Even during the events of Skyrim its typically Thalmor agents leading the inquisition not Imperial soldiers.Otherwise Imperials didnt really invade Skyrim. Skyrim has been an Imperial province since the start of the Third Era this is why the currency is septims named after the Septim dynasty of emperors of whom TalosTiber Septim was himself the founder. TThe Empire has mobilized forces to quell an insurrection but its very much Ulfric who is leading an attempted secession rather than the Imperials attempting a conquer new lands.,skyrim,dazqlqa,8,t5_2s837
9914552,0,t1_dazs3l9,Actually the Thalmor hate for men IS because they are men.

They literally want to erase man from history to the point of not being an idea that could be used to recreate them.Man considers Lorkhan their creator deity which automatically puts them at odds with the Thalmor.

Its also probably a bad assumption that anyone would fight with the Stormcloaks even against the Dominion. Theyre a notably xenophobic and bigoted movement in a world were xenophobia and bigotry are normal. The biggest thing though is that while Skyrim alone might be able to defend itself theres no way it can project power offensively against the Dominion. That might not sound terrible until you take into account the Thalmors goal is to quite literally unmake the world and the Tower in Skyrim they need to do so is already deactivated due to the events of Skyrim.

So they will make a title that will generate the most revenue. They also want to make a game that the most number of fans like while capturing more of the mainstream audience. So I conclude Bethesda will worry even if only slightly.The games you mentioned have characters that are targeted towards kids so they are more cartoony. Also they have figures which lend directly to the gameplay like Sonic the hedgehogs round form.

Id not even consider it a true RPG with the lack of anything resembling meaningful choices or character builds required for specific quests.Its not difficult scaling loot and enemies within the main storyline  just requires that your base systems in place for the game are robust and able to scale with the player.  It seems Bethesda is moving more towards attractive open world shooters with a few quest lines thrown in but mostly onrails action.

This is not true for weapons or magical gear however so you should place any of those kinds of items back on the corpse before reanimating them with your thrall spell.

10019419,1,t3_5j506z,I have to agree with several others here and elsewhere who have said that while both Skyrim and FO are good games they arent good RPG games in fact they arent RPG games at all in the traditional sense. Bethesda is catering to the bigger market share of casual gamers who in Bethesdas opinion dont want RPG game elements hence the dumbing down of TES series games and Fallout. Since Bethesda is a commercial game company in the game for the profit perhaps those gamers who really want an RPG base for gaming need to look elsewhere  the problem being there is no elsewhere to look.In my mind the ideal solution would be an open source modern game engine with an RPG foundation overlay but this might just be wishful thinking considering the amount of time and effort that would be required by a considerable number of people. Perhaps a subscription model as a means to pay for it while having GPLed code to protect the code base from corruption by money grabbers might work. The infrastructure to support that kind of effort is already in place working for other projects Linux kernel GNU and so it might be doable. Probably need some deep pocket shaman to get it going much like Shuttleworth did for Ubuntu because I doubt many would subscribe until there was a substantial offering on the table ready to be used by the subscriber base.,skyrim,dbdk48u,0,t5_2s837

Most of what could expand a save file is saving the states of all of the actors NPCS and the like so if you encounter more areas skyrim would have to simulate the actions of the actors within the active area the game is simulating. So more things would need to be kept track of even if they are out of range.

Some Thieves Guild quests make available additional fences throughout Skyrim. Note that the Fence skill perk allows you to sell stolen goods to any merchant that you can invest in.Even with the Fence perk however Thieves Guild fences still have the distinction of having the most gold of any merchants in the game with the exception of Lucan Valerius prior to version . of the Official Skyrim Patch though his superior merchant gold is only due to a bug up to  gold after completing all of the Special Jobs and up to  gold with the Master Trader perk making them useful even after the Fence perk is unlocked.

No qualms about performing exquisite tortures on lesser beings if it advanced their science hence the Falmer and in some cases a propensity for cruel blood sport. There is a platform in Blackreach featuring four posts meant to have chains strung between them and a spinning blade trap that runs across the middle of the platform. To one side several bleacherstyle stands and a throne. This was clearly a public execution machine designed to be as violent and spectacular as possible. Aside from this we find countless traps and torture devices scattered throughout their ruins even in common residential spaces. The Nords built traps too but only in their burial crypts where they intended to keep people out.No I dont particularly think Id have liked the ancient Dwemer.,skyrim,dbmfaou,5,t5_2s837

The only thing it really did was give some relevance to the holds that didnt have player homes and provide a base for many and better modded player homes. In the end however it could have been better with any of the following options. Customize player home according to race. Different races build different style homes.. Allow custom decoration of living spaces. Rooms should be decorated with clutter from player inventories making it worthwhile to buy things like cups plates and even flatware from vendors.. Extended blacksmithing to include weaving so we can make more clothing options than those available.. Larger player houses. The house in Solitude is currently the largest player home in the game. What if I want to build a freaking castle in The Pale and fill it with all the women I meet on my adventures?

10288091,0,t3_5n5sfn,This is kind of longThe beggers parents were respectable merchents in vaardenfel. Not rich but they never lacked for anything. The begger was a kind gentle boy leaner and shorter than most.One day the skies darkened and the begger saw a big gate made of fire in front of him. Out of the gate came horrible creatures that the boy tried to run away from. In a moment of confusion the boy ran into one of the fiery gates only realising his mistake after he was already through. The begger still sees the place in his nightmares he has no idea how long he was there  and what it looked like only the feeling of desperation he felt the smell the screams.The begger remembers waking up naked and freezing on a high snowy mountain. He was only a few years older but his body was full of scars  he was a bit taller and he was so lean that his bones stuck out of his body. But the biggest difference was that he was no longer the kind hearted and happy boy he once was. The begger hastened to the first city he came across only to find out that  years have past vaardenfel was destroyed and the dunmer are now outcasts. The local dunmer fed him gave him some rags to wear and told him that it would be better for him to find another city where dunmer are treated better and try his luck there. Sure enough that night one of the local nords came to the grey quarter  where the begger was staying and shouted about the trechery of the elves and what he would do to them.The next morning the begger left the city and traveled north there he found just outside the city  under a bush of snowberries a satchel. In that satchel there was a book. The book was brimming with magical energy and the begger opened the tome and attempted to read at that moment the tome disappeared and the begger felt the power within him. The begger continued on his way and saw a wounded goat. For a moment the begger was a boy again and he felt sorry for the poor goat. The begger walked up to the goat touched it and suddenly the goat was running. Happy with his discovery  the begger continued on to the city. When the begger reached the city  he heard from one of the guards that there was a college for mages in which he could hone his magical abilitiesThe begger than walked to the college where he was asked by a high elf to perform a basic spell. The begger was nervous and tired and the spell failed. Ashamed the begger went to the inn to find something to eat. After his money ran out the begger was forced to beg for food and water. Eventually realising that he would have to go to a warmer place the begger pacjed everything he had  which was not much and left. The begger walked for days over plains and mountains until he found a walled city which he knew would shelter him from the cold. At this point the begger was broken and didnt believe he could do anything but beg for food.The begger found that the people in the city are generous and the years went by with the broken begger living from one act of mercy to the other. One day the begger saw the assistant of one of the merchents drop a book on his way to the store on the market. The begger picked up the book and tried to return it but the assistent didnt listen saying he was to busy to talk. The begger remembered the disappointment from the last time he tried to use such a book and for a few hours he just sat next to it. Not knowing what to do. Night came and the begger who couldent contain his curiosity opened the tome and felt the familiar surge of energy within him only this time it was different he felt powerful and angry. He suddenly remembered the pain he felt his destroyed homeland and regretted all the years he spent doing nothing being nothing. The begger picked a lavender flower from the ground and flames came out of his hands and burned it. The begger decided that this is a sign from a higher power and made up his mind to become the most powerful mage in skyrim. He would focus on fire refusing at first to try restoration magic but enrolling in the college will return his confidence.,skyrim,dca7lzh,2,t5_2s837

10384890,0,t1_dchkjmd,I dont think the Imperials are racist so much as their culture is just being undermined. I mean Talos was the man that founded the Empire and conquered the world and he has been worshiped for a long time in the Empire so the Elves having outlawed his Worship is just as much of an afront to the Imperials as the Nords who have a personal and prideful stake in the matter because Talos was a Nord Dragonborn and many Nords identify with that Conquerors attitude that Talos embodies. Ultimately what the Conflict in Skyrim comes Down to is which side of Taloss Legacy do you want to see preserved. Those Jarls on the side of the Imperials wish to see the Political Legacy of Tiber SeptumTaloss Imperial Namepreserved. Tiber Septums goal and political legacy was to unite the world in peace and harmony and under his reign trade flourished a uniting of the races but this is not the dream of Nords and it is not what the Nords remember. The Nords remember him as the young Hero Talos who was called in the Eye of the Storm to the Greybeards and declared Dragonborn. Nords remember the warrior general Talos that Shouted Down the Walls of a Fortress and converted thousands of warring Nords under his banner with the power of his THUM! THAT IS THE TALOS THAT THE NORDS REMEMBER. But Tiber Septum is a completely different personality. His goal was still to Unite the World but he was willing and able to do it more diplomatically all be it with an army and Dragon at his back. The legacy of Tiber Septum is one of uniting the races and the world in attempts for a better future for all much like the philosophy and propaganda of Alexander the Great. In fact you should visit my reddit page and click on the link entitled Talos and Alexander if you want to know more about all of this. Personally I prefer the political legacy of Tiber Septum to the Heroic  Legacy of Talos. Ultimately I think the philosophy of the Nords would lead to another warring states period. The nords are definately more racist and nationalist. Ulfric wont even allow argonians or Khajeet to enter the city and he forced the Elves into a slum on the edge of the city. ,skyrim,dcl6wnt,1,t5_2s837

If not then the Stormcloaks are rebelling against an Empire that has allowed a foreign power to brutalize its citizens.

10567364,0,t1_dd5v4la,Witcher  and GTA V are both impressive but they dont nearly have the scope of Skyrim. Enter a room in Witcher and it looks nice and the art is all pretty but there isnt nearly the same level of detail. In Skyrim you have a first person view which automatically requires a higher level of detail and you can enter an interior and I know youre tired of hearing this pick up an item off the shelf and hold it in the air and it interacts with physics gravity other objects and casts shadows. Nearly everything is a game object in Skyrim and every game object has deep interaction and also just has the highest level of detail in general when it comes to interactions and gives you the greatest freedom to invent a playstyle. With so much complexity bugs are emergent. The Witcher  is completely rd person and restricts your movements and interactions. This container basically gives it a cheap shortcut to pretty graphics cinematic animations scripted interactions and forced gameplay mechanics. It may seem more polished and you might value that but im more into the Skyrim granular sandbox style. GTA is surely a different beast entirely. But still in Skyrim you have a world of the same size with much smaller details. Just my opinion.,skyrim,dd5xhwh,3,t5_2s837

10574896,0,t3_5rbiv2,A character in still playing Marsh Bones! He grew up in Black Marsh to a tribe of hunter gatherers where he learned the sword. He always had an interest in magic though but never had the aptitude nor the opportunity to learn. One day while looking for small game he came across a cave. Inside there was a lich from the days of the Ebonheart. The lich had nearly gone mad from the solitude and wanted to renounce his evil ways. After hearing the young argonians interest in magic he decided what he would do. The Lich taught him everything he knew before he decided to end his lichdom. The young argonian ran into a problem though. He wasnt very good at handling magic. He understood the theory of it but using magic exhausted him. He decided to use staves to focus his spells instead. Eventually the day came when the lich had enough of his long life. He wanted to explore the last mystery. He left the young argonian mentioning something about needing to free his soul from a few daedric princes. The young argonian returned to his tribe but they soon found it what he had been doing.

10612830,0,t3_5rwabc,Id probably choose either Knifepoint Ridge or Pinewatch. Both are in Falkreath hold so were not freezing to death. Knifepoint Ridge is far off the beaten path unlikely to be discovered by regular patrols and you have the high ground Anakin. With a mine for economy and loaded with facilities like a smelter forge and alchemy table you can keep your underlings nice and upgraded. Pinewatch is MUCH closer to a hold but it has easily the best cover around. If you train all your bandits to be sneaky you could keep ambushing caravans and merchants to keep up your economy and its extremely unlikely anyone will find the hidden passage in a house in the middle of nowhere. The downside however is that by continually abducting people less citizens will take that road.With that in mind Knifepoint ridge is my clear winner.,skyrim,ddams4z,39,t5_2s837

However if you go vampire lord you have to commit to it regularly biting people and playing primarily at night otherwise you might find that the drawbacks no regenerating staminahpmagika having to wait until night to run anywhere make the game less enjoyable.

10672726,0,t1_ddgmvvu,Aside from LOOT and cleaning the mods using the guide not really sure.  I dont believe I mentioned Wrye Bash  Another utility like LOOT and TESEdit dealing with mods.  Cant believe I didnt mention it before sorry   WB is mainly used to make whats called a bashed patch.  Ill just copy the definition from here  Basically each mod and yes even official DLCs and the main game that adds items weapons creatures etc. randomly to the world space use whats called a Leveled List this sort of acts like a database where items are pulled when an container NPC or enemy etc. is spawned and the items are chosen based on how far along you are in the game.  Now lets say you add several weapon mods that say add daggers to enemies at random and play the game. Now when it comes time to spawn said enemy one of two things will happen. Either one mod will spawn the daggers introduced in that mod only usually whichever mod is lower in your load order every time or a conflict may occur and crash your game.  A Bashed Patch helps alleviate those issues by combining all the leveled lists together so items are distributed evenly and without conflict thus making your game more varied and allows you to enjoy the items from all your mods rather than just from one mod all the time.  Anyway load up WB itll list all of your active mods.  Follow these steps  On screen  of the guide note the Update Bashed Patch window just make sure the same boxes on the left are ticked as shown when youre running it.  Hopefully this will help and its truly all I can think of modwise aside from .ini tweaks which will vary from system to system.  If theres still frequent CTDs then you may have to Google on how to copy your load order to text I know a program call Modwatch makes it easy and post it over in rskyrimmods for folks to look over.,skyrim,ddgt778,1,t5_2s837

When the Great War became inevitable his family attempted to flee but were caught by Dominion marines off the coast of Elswyr. He was able to cast a water breathing spell on himself but not his family. He was found on the beaches by a Khajit man who would become his mentor. He learned the way of the axe and used his skills to enchant items for the Khajit traders he called family. Their travels brought him to Skyrim where he left to continue his magical studies. He was enraptured by daedric magics and became the champion of Hermaeus Mora constantly seeking new knowledge and power haunted by his parents demise and his inability to save them. This led him to vampirism and he seeks to become the most powerful mage in the world through whatever means necessary.

Im not really applying different standards either I hold practically everyone else in the game to the same standards which is why Im not for either side of the civil war in the first place. Dont mischaracterize me when you failed to grasp what I said. Clearly you have blinders on then because most of the Dunmer bitch and moan about not having stuff handed to them when they dont give anything to the city. I guess you also ignored Ambarys being blatantly prejudiced against Nords to the point the murders dont even concern him unless a Dunmer is taken. Exploring it and talking to everyone and not just the demographic that supports your claim is kinda important in case you didnt know. You also completely ignored that it costs Windhelm more than it gets back to have the Dunmer there in the first place due to the decree of monument the most of the Nords in the city dont even care about the Dunmer and that two people bothering one Dunmer doesnt constitute an entire citys worth of Nords views. You pontificating at me like sogt Bigotry births bigotry  whats surprising there ?

You only need to sleep for  hour to be Well Rested and it adds value to the smaller towns the Inns throughout the map as well as beds found in dungeons. You need to sleep for at least an hour every  hours or your performance will drop slightly. You get sleepiness warnings at the top left starting at the th hour of being awake and you get a warning on the ththth hour. Theres been instances where I was about to become Sleepy and found a bed in a dungeon. It adds another layer of gameplay. The same goes for the food aspect. You need food every  hours and you only need to eat  something to fulfill Hunger. The mod is noninvasive has vanilla feel and Im enjoying it! ,skyrim,de7q9bw,1,t5_2s837

11032436,0,t1_deihd0z,gt we can only assume that the Thalmors still had a card up their sleeve to threaten the Emperor into agreeing into their demands. But we will never know what it was.Which is farfetched because they would have used it following the recapture of the Imperial City by the Legion if they had one. As far as we can see they lost half their military strength and a major commander in one battle. They had nothing to threaten the Empire except the army in Hammerfell. Which still would have been a dicey move for them Titus done goofed by not demanding equitable terms and its not something Ill ever be light on him for. gt Actually the Justiciars didnt start abducting people before the stormcloak rebelling. After the war although worship of Talos was banned everyone had their own personal shrine at home. It was sort of an open secret. But then Ulfric and his stormcloaks went into open rebelling. Thus forcing the Emperors hand into allowing Justiciars into Skyrim.Now Im not disputing the first part because Alvor confirms it. That being said this ties into the only reason Id ever support the Stormcloaks in the first place. gt But then Ulfric and his stormcloaks went into open rebelling. Thus forcing the Emperors hand into allowing Justiciars into Skyrim.The Empire in my opinion loses its rights to govern when it fails to uphold one of the most crucial duties of its obligation to the people. It failed to protect Imperial citizens from Thalmor oppression by nature of the fact the Thalmor had the legal authority to enforce a ban on Talos worship. Ulfric is by no means a saint and not really a man I can entirely sympathize with. But one thing he is right on is that the WGC is bullshit and that Skyrims people shouldnt be beholden to tyrannical nonsense. gt The Emperor did not want his people to suffer anymore. After retaking the Capital back from the Thalmors he witnessed the atrocities committed by the Thalmors to the citizens of the city and realized that he did not wish for his people to continue struggling.So youre saying the Emperor put feels above realistic political observation? Then hes a poor ruler he should have known immediately after reading the terms that the WGC was meant to split the Empire and weaken the moment he read it. Saying he wanted people not to suffer because of the war is hardly a defense of his decisions. Now heres my problem with your last paragraph. Its been  years since the end of the Great War and the Empire has not renounced the WGC and declared hostilities against the AD. I think the civil war is stupid as well but Ulfrics point is very much valid. Why should Skyrim be beholden a bad deal because of the Emperors bad judgement? And what kind of Empire allows a truce that states their enemies can extort tribute from them and stamp out freedom of religion in all their provinces? Its not defensible Ulfric is probably a self interested noble trying to secure the throne at worst but hes also right about the WGC. ,skyrim,deii2bu,1,t5_2s837

You dont want to burn yourself out by taking on two characters at the same time but on the other hand you dont want to let that itch to roleplay die out while it is present.

11233759,0,t1_df4vsw4,I think you misunderstand about Shor. To humans he is the king of the Divines other than Akatosh because he pretty much made them. Without Shor there are no humans. Lorkhan may be an evil God by the elven standards as he stole away their godhood but to humans he is their creator. That is part of the reason why elves and humans tend not to get along. All that Lorkhan did was trick the Aedra into creating the realm of Mundus using a part of the Divines to anchor it. For that they tore out his heart and cast it away. This is why the Daedra can manifest themselves more easily in Nirn as their forms. The mortal remains of the Aedra are the planets that are around Nirn. The sun is the hole in which Magnus escaped from Mundus and the stars are the holes where the lesser Aedra escaped.And the Divines were not just feelings they were the children of Anu and Padomay who were in turn created by Sithis. Mara as with all of the original  Divines were there from the beginning.And Im not sure why you think Hjalti was a separate person from Tiber Septim. Hjalti EarlyBeard was one of the many names of Tiber Septim. As for the one who speaks to you as if you were Hjalti EarlyBeardTiber SeptimTalos StormcrownYsmir he likely died in the battle that took place there and didnt know it. So that isnt any fault of Talos.While there are some children left of the Septim bloodline at least in the form of legitimate heirs it would seem that they are instead more likely to be found in the royal families of Morrowind more specifically the bloodline of Barenziah. And interestingly enough we actually meet one of Barenziahs descendants in Skyrim Karliah.  Beyond that there arent many of the Septim bloodline left thanks to the Mythic Dawn. They were quite thorough in killing off the Septims. Otherwise the Dragonfires would not have gone out.And its still true in that you are not doing anything other than the main quest canonically. As for why you can do them and why you must do them to level up its an RPG. Thats kind of what needs to happen otherwise theres no incentive. Canonically the Dragonborn would have been able to take on Tsun honorably from the getgo. You are less powerful because of reasons of gameplay. And canonically you are only going to be defeating Tsun in fair combat as he says. Anything else is simply not canon.And it isnt fan fiction in the slightest its theorizing based on evidence given. If youd rather pretend that your role play is canon then go right on ahead.And of course it is ultimately Shors realm. In that realm Sovngarde the heroes may only obey Shor. Only Shor can control the doors of his hall only Shor can sit in his throne. I dont know what part of Shor and Shor alone you arent getting because thats essentially the modus operandi of Sovngarde. Sure he isnt controlling the heroes but it is only with his permission that they may leave as Tsun clearly says to you before you cross the whalebone bridge. Yes the hero can choose but only Shor can let them leave.This is all canon as laid out by the creators of the game. And trust me I know my Elder Scrolls canon. I know it inside and out to the point where I begin to sound as crazy as Septimus Signus when speaking about it. Hell a some of my own theories are based on things that Septimus says about the Elder Scrolls.,skyrim,df5bxq3,1,t5_2s837

The Brexit movement didnt really officially touch on the subject but a lot of the Leave establishment were happy for an undercurrent of antiimmigrant feelings to prop up the campaign. Tolerance bordering on encouragement is not excusable.Unfortunately mistrust and mistreatment of outsiders is only natural during any king of pronationalistindependence campaign and while its impossible to declare the Stormcloaks as a racist organisation the nasty side effects of the Skyrim belongs to the Nords attitude is enough to want to oppose it.it doesnt help that Ulfrics own city is a mess  segregation based on race is racist and the they may say some racist things but never truly act racist line doesnt wash.,skyrim,df60isd,2,t5_2s837

Generally speaking the magic is pretty restricted to mysterious characters or major plot points and likely wouldnt play a regular part in the games. At that point it would just become an open world game set in a fictional medieval world which could still be fun especially if the quests were as complicated and detailed as the story from the books. I think it would be a neat opportunity to veer away from the story of the books and show to go explore parts of the world we havent seen like Asshai and much of Essos or to have a story set in Westeros during the war against the Children of the Forest.

There are also some mage rings to be found there.   Dragon masks can be good for mages though you may want to look for a mod that offers nonarmor versions of them.Dragon shouts are magic too.   Unlock more shouts.   The augment perks in destruction make fire breath frost breath and storm call stronger.  The Stability perk in Alteration makes the Slow Time shout last longer.You can get a quest for the Wabbajack staff in Solitude.   Have you done the drinking game quest in the Whiterun inn?Have you done the Azuras Star quest?  Do the murder investigation quest in Windhelm for a good mage amulet.Enchanting will let you make great mage gear.  ,skyrim,dg2srhf,4,t5_2s837
11532100,0,t3_64j06v,Elder Scrolls VI is almost definitely going to be about the Dominion. Theres so many ingame hints for it already. That helps to really narrow down the options.Obviously wont be Skyrim. It wont be Morrowind because  its geopolitically irrelevant and  they already had a game on it and resolved all its existential world ending issuesIt wont be Black Marsh just for lore reasons I think. Its too inhospitable and theyd need to either break a lot of lore or make the environment the main antagonist. It probably wont be Cyrodiil or High Rock since we just had Cyrodiil as a province and High Rock was the major province for ES. Plus High Rock has had all its conflicts resolved and is in something called the great peace or something so not much going on there.I dont think itll be Summerset since I doubt you could make up a convincing reason to allow something like a Nord set foot on the island at the present time.So that leaves Hammerfell Valenwood and Elsweyr. I think personally theyd just combined Valenwood and Elsweyr since the two provinces are so small and it would make the environment less homogeneous. Hammerfell has an active rebellion against the Dominion right now so that one is super obvious. Theres also tons of story with Hammerfell with the Dwemer Nedes Yokuda and Tiber Septim. Elsweyr and Valenwood Im less sure on. Theres some Numidium stuff potentially some Void NightsLorkhan moon shanigans and Valenwood has the Trees.But either way those two options are my personal pick. Also if they go with ValenwoodElsweyr the game is definitely going to be called Dominion.I personally want to see SummersetAlinor in all its High Elven glory but I think thats probably unlikely. Also each game has focused on the deactivation of a Tower. Numidium Red Mountain WhiteGold and SnowThroat. Alinor already has had its tower deactivated during Oblivion so for the trend to hold wed need to go to a province with an active Tower. Hammerfell has Oricalcum but nothing is known but the name and its probably on Yokuda anyways. I dont think Elsweyr has a Tower. I think Valenwood still has an active one so if theyre planning some kind of grand metastory thats the likely province.,skyrim,dg35z19,3,t5_2s837

Force her into IAFTs system either through the spell or a dialog option that should appear on her.  Second select Follower OptionsgtActionsgtDrink My Blood.  Third set up transformations by choosing Follower OptionsgtCombatgtUse Vampire LordWerewolfgtselect when to transform.Moonlight Tales This second mod Im a little unfamiliar with but it was suggested when I asked if there was a way to make Vilja into a werewolf.  It makes wereforms into the disease they are described as in lore.  You can be infected by any wild werewolf or werebear.  Unlike with Vampirism it takes only one scratch to become infected or to infect someone else but it works very much the same after that.  Once  days have passed you or whomever you infected will be a full fledged werebeast.  There is a separate cure for this form from the vanilla one which you will have to seek out should you choose to become normal again or cure your follower.  Im not certain on how follower transformations can be controlled with this mod if they can even be controlled at all.  Youll have to find that out on your own.,skyrim,dg748ra,1,t5_2s837

11677756,0,t1_dgjnfg3,gt I dont get this argument the Empire had a good chance of demanding an equitable peace after the Battle of the Red Ring. At that point there was only one Dominion left and the Empire could have turned that into a meat grinder at little expense to their Legions. The Redguards did it without them anyway and won furthermore the Dominion had no means of attacking Cyrodiil after the Battle of the Red Ring. Titus Mede II took the easy way out and fucked over his subjects and his Empire in the process. Its possible the Thalmor are just really bad at desert combat had less troops to work with and didnt have the advantage of a sneak attack on Hammerfell like they did with Cyrodiilgt The Thalmor didnt cause the Void Nights it was an extended eclipse and the Thalmor only claimed to used magic to dispel it after it had ended effectively tricking the Khajiit. That they in fact did fix the problem is entirely speculation and given that the Thalmor are liars and scum we cant trust their account. Im taking the whole Void Nights thing from Michael Kirkbride. Most people dont like taking his word for it but the Thalmor and the WGC lore came from him.gt A fair question since I wasnt clear I was saying Ulfric having it easier than Talos means he likely wont mess up especially given that the Jarls he put in place depend on him to maintain their power.Ill admit I hadnt realized that maybe the Jarls probably wont be doing a lot of independent decisions given that theyre pretty terrible and Ulfric might actually be aware of that.,skyrim,dgjouu4,1,t5_2s837

They wouldnt be happy and be praying a bunch for guidance.I can see it now...Journal of Paladin Danzegt That child... Clear signs of abuse mixed with daedra worship. In the name of the Divines I will seek out this Honorhall Orphanage and investigate this Grelod.gt... No. This will not stand.

11727217,0,t1_dgpa2yl,I agree with most of that actually.  The electoral college was created as a way to circumvent the uneducated masses in a way...education back then wasnt exactly universal.  But I also agree its a pretty shitty thing to have in this day and age.Im not really comparing the U.S. to places where voting doesnt even matter more trying to highlight the inherent flaws a twoparty system has on voting itself.  I saw how the French do it these days and was kind of impressed with their system...even though Le Pen really concerns me.Someone here recently compared Trump to Mussolini but I think he was referring more to corporatism and not fascism.  Donald is too distracted by wealth and his image to give much thought to real hardline authoritarianism.  Hes the greedy megeneration version of Benito I suppose.  D,skyrim,dgpb6vw,1,t5_2s837
11728913,0,t3_67cjqt,gtIs stuff like performancestability much better optimized in the special edition?So they say but I have a midrange rig and Oldrim with all kinds of visual mods ranging from grass and K textures to a light ENB gives me more FPS than vanilla SE. There was some thread where a couple of guys with the same card as me GTX  had trouble making SE stay at  FPS on ultra. Also the benchmarks Ive seen with the  confirm this.If I had the hardware Id try modding SE just out of curiosity the biggest improvement to me was that there was no more zfighting in the mountains. My Oldrim looks really good with all the mods including DynDOLOD but the flickering distant mountains are really ugly.But yeah with my specs theres no point to play SE.edit But SE should indeed be more stable,skyrim,dgpi43i,1,t5_2s837

11730020,0,t1_dgpli0p,Ive seen enough hentai to know where Elder scrolls will go if he continues to exist. Besides in APOCRYPHA you see the tendrils and eyes and even pincers but on one section you need three books. One about Observing Orbs eyes one about gnashing pincers his of you look at his statue one about tendrils his sugoi desu rape tentacles he shoved into storn and a forth about daggers teeth. We never see the teeth and he is an ancient God from the primal times when the gods were beastial symbols. He could be more vicious than were lead to believe. Surrounding yourself with something is a way to hide insecurities perhaps HermaMora is more beastial than we see. After all the Ohgma is singularly the weakest artifact in game only giving five levels per skill. And the books give you power and he HOARDS knowledge he doesnt create it.
