10212735,0,t3_5k16oi,To be honest this looks like the standard  form for  cf.  p.  and p.  or any of theseThe  forms are extremely abbreviated with some strokes even missing or connected which seems to be the case here as well. If you compare the  form with the  form which is not as abridged you can readily see which strokes were combined or slurred together and that the top part  is missing altogether in the  form.Personally I would always view these different forms as steps in a fluid development resulting in a form that just flows right out of your hand.,shodo,dc1o6cf,2,t5_3byf3
