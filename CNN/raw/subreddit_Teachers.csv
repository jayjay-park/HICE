3668,0,t3_1u4ceu,Get to know the kids!  Spend the first few days learning names but more importantly find out what motivates them.  Also in Kindergarten most of the time you have a wide range of knowledge because of varied amounts of preschool experience.  Find out what basic knowledge each student has.  This will make differentiation much easier once you start actually teaching.  Also maybe bring in a favorite Kindergarten appropriate book for a read aloud?  The teacher will most likely have time for you to read it over the first few days and it will the kids get to know you!,Teachers,ceeussn,2,t5_2qqcs
69645,0,t3_1uwdsj,Its a nitpicky thing but I probably would err on the side of your teacher. You defined all three of them correctly yeah but part of taking a test and doing any sort of close reading is making sure that youre really being certain of what youre writing down. I do mark down for right answers in the wrong spot because I want my students to learn that directions and close reading are super important. Im glad youre able to admit that it was your mistake. a lot of kids who are in your situation blame us by default. Take it as a lesson and ask your teacher if theres anything you can do to help bring your grade up I typically give kids extra credit for coming to help me clean in the mornings or for staying after to help me fold copies etc. ,Teachers,cemcwft,7,t5_2qqcs

I was really nervous when I started teaching this year about building a community and all that setting rules and expectations. It was a lot easier at the midyear semester change after I had done it once myself and knew what I wanted more solidly.Making all of my own stuff was also a change. When I student taught I would just go through my coops file cabinets and pull out what I wanted. Even though I work at the same school where I student taught we changed textbooks and all of us are kind of starting from scratch. I thought it would be difficult to make all of my own notes sheets and homeworks etc but after the first two weeks I got a lot better and I set up a google drive account with different folders. Now that Im teaching the same class a second time I just print my stuff from last semester. Its kind of like once youve done it once you have it for life.The last thing I think is harder is having to deal with admin. When I student taught if I forgot to post an objective on the board it was on my coop. Now Im responsible for everything that goes on in my room I have deadlines to keep and additional responsibilities registering students for next semesteryear for the next class sending home info to parents conferences and back to school night etc. Theres a lot to keep up with but if youre organized and take advantage of your prep time youll be ok.,Teachers,cg39mg8,3,t5_2qqcs

There are other videos by the same speaker on different parts of SBG that you should also check out they should appear in the sidebar on Youtube. Its a fair amount of work to shift from traditional grading to SBG but dont let that dissuade you. Also be aware that there is a lot of pushback from parents in places where its being used but most of what Ive read from concerned parents is that they dont understand it and dont know how to interpret it. Youre going to have to work to communicate what these grades mean when parents see something on a  scale for example rather than the  scale if you go that route I dont. The biggest advantage that SBG has over assignmentbased grading is that you know exactly where students need attention where you need to review or reteach something as an educator and have the ability to do nuanced differentiation ooooh look at the buzzword soup!. In the meantime if you want to work with the  scale that youve got now you can and align the grades to standards. Im having trouble tracking down a link to the exact rubric Im using to describe performance on standards a summary anyhow of what each level indicates but Ill try to remember to post it on Monday when I get back to my office. Basically its  for no submissionincomplete   limited understanding  for basic understanding   proficient still making mistakes but understanding the process   a couple minor mistakes or one major error .  one minor error   mastery can help others with the process. Heres a blog post from a teacher reflecting on a year of using SBG and contains links to major thinkers on the topic. I skimmed through it but it seems to be very honest about what youre looking at if you want to consider SBG in your future. All the best to you. I fell down the rabbit hole a couple years ago but as a language instructor dealing with hundreds of students a year it helps me give constructive precise feedback to my students so that they can start to take command of their own learning journey.

778040,0,t3_230tth,Im going to say something blunt here those teachers are hacks.Remember the goal learning. Kids wont learn when theyre afraid. Kids cant be inspired and actively engaged when theyre afraid. Kids cant like school when theyre afraid.How about having your kids respect you? How about having too good of a classroom climate? How about your kids are too engaged to do ?If you try to rule a classroom solely through fear the kids wont learn much and youll end up burned out. Here are my tips for managing a heterogenous th grade classroomgtbe as quick to praise as you are to criticize.gtspeak in an even tone. Firm confidant but even. gtwhat happens disciplinarily in the classroom stays in the classroom. In other words say hi to the kids in the halls smile at them ask how their weekend was and get to know them.gtrelated they wont care how much you know until they know how much you care.gtIm proud of you is one of the most powerful phrases in teaching.gtyoure better than that is toogtNever get into a verbal back and forth with a student. Say your piece and move on in tone topic and body language. If they want to continue with it send them out if your room.gtteach hard teach passionately and be prepared. They can sense it and respect it.Maybe my favorite compliment Ive ever received from a student was Mr.  you are the nicest funniest but also meanest teacher Ive ever had.

837669,0,t3_23q3lj,Yes you will regret it. Yes you will wonder if it was the right choice. No you wont make enough money to make it worth it. But you will have those days that make it all worth it if you are a good teacher. If you love math and share that love with the students all will go well. But you have to put the money aside. Teaching is not for those who want to be rich or even wealthy or simply comfortable. Teaching is the hardest job that people think anyone can do. You cant do it for the respect because you wont get it the money or the schedule. Some days teaching sucks. Kids are jerks. Parents are the ones they learned it from and are even bigger jerks. You dont have enough breaks and some days it will drive you to drink. But... some days kids are awesome. Some days a parent tells you that you made a difference. Some days you know you are a rockstar and its all worth it. But it will never be worth it unless you know that you are a teacher at heart. It needs to be an inward motivation that overrides the outward negativities of the job. I recommend subbing as much as you can. You may realize you hate high schoolers but love middle schoolers or visa versa. You may learn you love th graders! The only way that you can figure out if you are a teacher is if you try. I suggest trying all different kinds of schools public private high income low income and see where you fit. For me its private education. There arent enough teachers out there who love their subject so please pursue it and see what you think. But you will have to get over the negative aspects because those are not changing anytime soon. ,Teachers,cgzhuvu,2,t5_2qqcs

952770,0,t1_chc6w4c,My typical class consists of getting all of the students to log in to class then transferring the days lesson to their tablets. As I do this I usually try to get them to start talking about the lesson for the day by asking questions and getting them to respond. After Ive done this I move them into the curriculum reading and listening passage. I do use the technology to also make fun in tablet games to teach them how to attack academic passages and such. Theres a function in our software that allows us to pick random students and I use this coupled with pictures to get them to engage in the class. To the credit of the software and tablet the integration isnt much different than with a book. Im a teacher first and foremost and teaching children means you will always have to deal with distractions whether digital or otherwise.

982218,0,t3_25b3cj,Funny story from when I was a HS student circa ish. We had drug dogs in school about  times a year. One teach mentioned how he never ever looks out the window on drug dogs day.  his story goes One day the drug dogs are there and he is watching a couple of students jump out the first floor window and run to their car. They zoom off blowing out of the parking lot. Teacher thinks its funny goes back to teaching class. BUT he ended up having to testify against the students and did not enjoy that experience.  So now... he never looks out the window. Ignorance is bliss eh?  I wish it was as simple as leaving it alone. At most HS and many middle schools in the US it is fairly easy to obtain drugs especially weed. It is not all the difficult. But who wants to get fired sued or harassed for not reporting a rumor that some kids was selling weed.

Something like GarageBand Fruity Loops or Sony Acid may be easier to work with allowing students to see results more quickly. If you really want to hit the notation side then you may want to check out Note Flight freecheap cloudbased or MuseScore free a bit dated but functional.

Are you   trying to give a more realworld feel and let kids resolve it themselves? Or  Stepping in to metaphorically hold hands to make sure kids behave themselves during a school assembly?Im personally more inclined to let kids sort things out themselves. If the victims ask for help Ill absolutely step in but Im not there to babysit. The bullies in school are often the most broken kids on the inside perhaps just reaching out for attention in unhelpful ways. If you step in are you enabling their attention seeking ways? Or are you enabling their bad behavior by only stepping in when necessary? A bit of both?

1421225,0,t3_2aeadf,Ive done it with middle schoolers before where we were reading a story but the rusher got a photocopied version of the book a page or two at a time. He could read ahead but not that far. This kid though read ahead because he got a twisted satisfaction from either spoiling things for other students or using information from future pages to make really strong predictions and he thought I thought he was super smart.  He was frustrated at first but then slowed down to reading just what he got. On the opposite side I was a rusher in math. I didnt understand the idea of checking work. So the teacher gave me about ten worksheets while she gave everyone else only one or two. She expected me to finish them all while she meticulously went over the first two. Then shed grade them all or grade them all I dont remember bc Im pretty sure I never saw them again and tell me that everyone else got  bc they did them together but I got a  because I did it on my own and was wrong. A few doses of that medicine and I wasnt happy with my grade and started slowing down. I was in fifth grade. Hope one of those works!! ,Teachers,ciuffai,1,t5_2qqcs

1449852,0,t3_2aouif,Hi Dr. Elmore Jim Knight is a colleague and good friend of minehe and I are just down the hall from each other. You and I met a few years ago and had lunch with a few doctoral students headed by Jim. Its nice to chat with you again thanks for being here.I have three questions  My first question revolves around the privatization of education. Is this happening in other countries like Canada or the UK? Is America the only place in which noneducators are in increasingly in educational positions of power and decisionmaking? I consider the role of the community family members and parents to be vital levers in influencing our schoolshowever I often make the analogy between noneducators being in charge of schools and a hospital. Just because youve been to a hospital a handful of times throughout your life doesnt mean youre qualified to be a brain surgeon. Furthermore just because youve flown on planes your whole life surely doesnt make you qualified to fly the plane. Education is the only profession that by experience of a K education everyone thinks he or she is qualified to work in our schools. It seems counterintuitive to say that our teachers are doing poor jobs while putting noneducators in leadership roles.   What educational statistic or theory or research would most surprise the general public?   What are you currently reading? Authors book journals etc. etc. ,Teachers,ciy0j9b,2,t5_2qqcs

Thirty years ago I watched a retired Navy officer an Annapolis graduate wash out during student teaching. He just couldnt handle adolescents. I on the other hand had quit school played in bands and bummed around. To me it seemed to come naturally and Im still teaching. Thing is if you love it the other stuff gets figured out. But if you dont love it none of it is going to be any fun. See if you can get a teaching gig even subbing or summer school before you pull the trigger on getting your Masters degree. I think most teachers know within a couple of months if it is right for them. Some try to make a go of it anyway and they end of really suffering because of it.

As an English teacher who teaches mostly writing I know that the timeliness of my feedback is greatly impacted by class size students vs .  Another difference i have found with larger class size is the noise level involved with students working together.  I work at a very high performing school with excellent students but the noise level of  students working together is quite different than  or  students working together.

Finding a teaching job is hard enough and finding a local teaching job requires incredible luck.I just graduated with my M.Ed and finished my student teaching in May.  I am from PA which is a really rough state for teachers.  I applied to at least  openings over four months.  I subscribed to a service that scoured school websites and consolidated a listing of all of the openings.  I was regularly spending  at the post office sending out thick application packets to schools that required paper.  I have at least  applitrack profiles for online applications.  I used PAEducator and PAREAP to apply to schools who posted their jobs on those services.  Allinall I would say I got roughly one interview per eight applications.  I made sure to go out and get myself a nice new wellfitting suit.  I prepared heavily for my interviews taking the advice of books like these on amazon.  book  bookI was rarely the sole interviewee.  In the waiting rooms I often found myself sitting next to candidates with  years experience.  Interviews happened more and more as we got closer to August.  July was for sure my busiest month.  I was still getting calls in August from desperate schools though.  I even got one last week.Even with all of my interviews I was not able to secure a job in PA by the end of July.  My interviews were often followed by rejection letters even when I thought things went really well.  I ended up accepting a position in Virginia from a school I came into contact with at a career fair.  It is possible I might have found something from one of the more desperate PA schools in August but I wasnt willing to take the risk.  Even with all of the elbow grease I put in I wasnt able to find myself a job instate.  I was applying to every district that had openings too.

1895395,0,t1_ckh89mr,I used rough to umbrella several feelings but Ill try to explain a couple of them.When I have a rough day in the sense that I feel overwhelmed by the amount of grading I have to do as counterproductive as this sounds I put it to the side let myself refresh and tackle it the next day.  If Im in a grumpy or sour mood Im going to inaccurately assess student work which is not fair to the student.When I have a rough day in the sense that the kids were not on game as I tell them I keep myself grounded by remembering that these students are coming from homes where discipline and structure is rare.  If for some reason they aim negative language toward me its rare but it happens I remind myself that if when theyre upset or mad they use that language toward me they are probably hearing much much worse at home when a guardian or adult is angry or upset at them.  They dont know how to communicate or channel their emotions because they never had seen it exampled.  Its this thought that helps keep me sane and calm when its happening.  Instead of jumping and lunging and kicking them out I respond to them calmly and logically and explain why that behavior is not acceptable after the class or whenever the student is not being focused on.  I tell them that I see his or her potential and that he or she needs to focus on him or herself.  They go shellshocked because they dont expect the response to be like that.  I found out that when I do this those snotty comments dont eat away at me when I go home but instead the connection I feel when I have those chats. ,Teachers,ckhl37f,2,t5_2qqcs

Unless its an end of unit project or essay marking every error and trying to correct every mistake be it grammatical or factual will wear you out. If it leaves you as the teacher drained just imagine how an exhaustive line edit for every paper will make your young students feel. Be transparent and precise about your grading criteria and never work harder than your students. I also agree that it is up to you whether an assignment should be entered or if it can be written off as an informal assessment. I hope all this helps.,Teachers,ckwocm6,6,t5_2qqcs

Why should I hire you and not the other person who has similar experiences? This may seem somewhat counterintuitive but your resume doesnt make me want to ask you any questions  I feel like I know everything about you from these two pages.Here are my suggestions Revamp the layout of your resume. Youre a math teacher so Im guessing youve heard of Dan Meyer but have you seen his resume Its far more impressive than yours or mine but its visually striking as well. find a photography friend and take some head shots. Add the best one to your resume. Know what makes you stand out? Having an image to go with your text. do everything you can to get your resume to  page. Most recruiters arent going to flip to page  anyway. Keep whats important and ditch the rest. Consider what an HR rep is going to see thats going to make them want to talk to you again. add color but not to ill effect. This is probably a dangerous suggestion but again you want to set yourself apart in a positive way.Thats all I have for now. I hope I came across constructively and not as a total jerk.

2182160,0,t3_2k0uxc,It is taught but it is rarely taught well. I have taken on a lot of student teachers and I have always given them feedback on their classroom management.  Really the only way to teach it is in action.  I will use a copy of my seating plan to show them how they move around the room.  It allows them to see which students they are avoiding. Here is my advice.  When you assign work to the class let them know that you will collect whatever they have completed at the end of the class. They will not take it home to do later. This way their teacher sees what they actually accomplished. I used to tell subs that they were to collect all completed work at the end of class.  This was for the benefit of everyone but especially the sub.  Most often they would leave a note saying that they let the students take it for homework not wanting to admit that they got so little done. I learned to tell the subs I will not look at any work that students take home only what they complete in class today. Surprise the students got their work done.  ,Teachers,clh7eo7,3,t5_2qqcs

2404072,0,t3_2mygmg,I think some of it depends on what subject you are teaching and what counts as use of technology. If the school has interactive whiteboards and that is considered use of technology then I can definitely see the point have your slides prepared so you dont waste time writing stuff on the whiteboard.I have also been told and found myself that students will often listen more intently to a video of someone else explaining the same thing that you could explain yourself even in exactly the same words. Im tempted to try using a video of myself explaining something and see if the students pay more attention to that than they would to me.Also multiple modes of learning comes into play here. Explain something verbal show a video visual and arrange an activitydiscussion kinaesthetic maybe a bit sort of.Of course exactly what you can use the technology for depends a lot on what you teach. I teach mathematics and so explanation of a method or proof on video and preprepared slides of the appropriate formulae can be very useful  as can preprepared questions with preprepared but hidden answers.If on the other hand use of technology requires some kind of interactive activity using tablets or netbooks that would be an absolute pain to arrange since you cant really prepare something yourself but instead have to rely on available programs or websites that the students can access  and it would pretty much preclude group activities since all the students would be staring at their individual screens.Finally your courses are intended to teach you stuff. Demanding use of technology forces you to learn how to operate and make use of that technology  whether it be particular hardware or more general software tools. Just like writing essays makes you think about and understand a topic even if you will never write an essay in your professional life so insisting on use of technology makes you learn how to use it what it can do and what it cant do. Even if you never use it in your career the fact that they forced you to means they have done their job in instilling understanding in you.,Teachers,cm8uoju,1,t5_2qqcs

Essentially those that are trying to buy bathroom passes to boost their grades will learn that they can buy a better grade. Not a good message to be sending as a teacher.I actually ran into this at a school that I attended and the teacher was reprimanded for allowing a black market for grade boosters. It was pretty much the same situation.I wouldnt allow them to turn in more bathroom passes than they are given. You also could run into a situation where someone has to choose between using the restroom or a higher grade which is a pretty uncomfortable situation to be in as a child.I find that the good students eventually have a problem with situations like this and these are most likely the students that get their parents involved.I know from teaching experience that the bathroom has become a nightmare to deal with in the classroom and privileges are taking advantage of every day.

I have great support from my administrators and fellow teachers and I honestly dont mind the hours at all I coach football and soccer as well but I get very aggravated at laziness and dealing with kids with no drive. Now of course I understand part of my job as a teacher is to motivate my kids but I also feel that that should be less of a focus in high school in which these kids are old enough to take responsibility for themselves.

You can do so many awesome things but if administration doesnt see it you will be overlooked.Start connecting with teachers and administrators. Dont be afraid of them. Touch base with the classroom teacher the next day. See if you can attend department meetings and faculty meetings.Finally look at the job climate of your school. You can be the best subteacher on the planet but if there are no jobs or the likelihood of one you need to begin to look into other schools. Additionally if other subs or new hires get leave replacements or jobs over you this is another sign to move on.How do I know this? I subbed  years in a school and the teachers and students loved me...as a sub. I then got overlooked as a leave replacement and was told they needed me as a sub. I was that good. I left. During a leave replacement in another district I was offered a job that gave me my own class that wasnt full time. The principal told me to take it. Why? His school was not going to hire for a very long time and he didnt want me to miss a great career opportunity. Edit I currently work at that school and it was a good move.I only knew about those situations because I spoke with the higher ups.Edit Personally it bothers me that so many people care about being cool. Stop it. I had so many awesome lame teachers. The driest teacher taught me to read and changed my life. She wasnt cool she was hard working and caring. Cool is such an overrated term.

I was following my cooperating teachers lesson plans for this to keep the kids in their routines.

After four weeks of teaching reading my cooperating teacher started taking back over the classroom since I was leaving soon to graduate. The first day she worked with the small groups the kids were reading their decodable texts just like they did everyday...or so I thought. The classroom teacher turned to me and said Oh my gosh. They are READING! They are fluently reading this text! They werent doing that when I gave them to you. You taught them to READ!

2919703,0,t1_cnz075p,I also wanted to ask did you adjust the grading scale at all?If you instituted the policy of  instead of  without changing anything else that would cause massive grade inflation across the board.It seems like in order to implement this policy well while keeping the same basic meaning for each letter grade youd need to give out points more sparingly.  So for example require a higher quality of work to get each point.  This would be because you were effectively diluting everythingi.e. old Bs would become As old Ds would become Bs etc.  So youd need to compensate for this in order to have the same grading scale but get the benefit of the spirit or purpose of the no zeroes policy i.e. not giving disproportionate weight to missed assignments.Id be curious to know if this is what happened...or if there were any problems with doing this.

We teach students. We train them. If they come in with insufficient skills we work on them. We dont judge them as an entitled generation.

The other option is that you look for an Alternative Certification program if you do decide to become an educator! One of my cooperating teachers did that because he graduated with a math degree but no teaching certification and he said it wasnt too bad. So if I were you I would start at those places.

3101266,0,t3_2vlvid,Ive been a Google Apps Admin for two schools on the initial deployment in both cases. Some thoughts. Make sure your network is robust. It will see much more traffic than usual. Be prepared. You cant work well if your network falls over.. Change management is hard. Have a plan. Roll out slowly. Provide massive amounts of support. If you can get Synergyse training. Its yr. for teachers and free for students. For the MSO holdouts from my cold dead fingers install Drive for PC or Mac. Under no circumstances allow them to use Outlook for mail.. Standardize on Google Chrome. IT should learn how to deeply it and how to manage mandatory Chrome settings apps extensions home pages etc. from within the Google Apps Admin Console. Synergyse has free training for the console I believe. Have all the teachers syncing.. Use OUs properly.If you do those four things your life will be amazing. Everything will always work. Uptime is ... almost perfect. Teachers will be able to offer realtime feedback to students before they turn in work making official draft submission basically unnecessary. Google has a document workflow called Classroom that will hand out and collect assignments. If you combine that with an extension called Goobric you can grade essays using a rubric and provide feedback to students much more quickly than youre used to.Dont listen to the not as good as MSO comments here. No the office tools arent as good. Theyre more than sufficient for anything K is going to require. I cant think of a single thing Id want the suite to do for my students that it doesnt do well enough. I teach a fair amount of PBL too which will push the limits on that kind of thing. You want students to be able to write and cite. Check. Analyze science lab data? Check. Graphing? Sure some formatting will be simpler but that is not what we are teaching is it? We worry about students producing quality work that shows proficiency. There is no missing functionality that will keep them from doing that and the anywhere any time access to their documents will probably make it easier for the students.Check your network. Train your teachers and admins. Roll out carefully.,Teachers,cojg0yv,5,t5_2qqcs

On the last page there are links to college websites about further style guidelines and how to avoid plagiarism when using sources.  It shows how to format things properly in a Work citedBibliography as well as how to do in text citations. I saved it and used it through the first year of college while I was still getting in the hang of it.  I hope that it may help.As for essay structure writing is all about making a point proving a statement substantiating an argument.  The  paragraph essay structure can serve you very well in doing this because it is good to have at least three examples of evidence which you have analyzed to support your claim.  It is also good to give the counter argument and demonstrate why it is incorrect.  This shows that you are able to not only understand and support your opinion but defend it against critique.I think the things that are often hard to master are the little things that are a part of formal writing staying in third person do not make personal statements do not say I or you do not use contractions and stay in the same verb tense throughout.

3249298,0,t3_2xaw2o,gt Why did you become a teacher?A lot of reasons. The root of which is that the most fun I ever had was helping other people learn how to make cool things at University. Although that being said I am the first to admit that this wasnt the primary motivating factor which was lifework balance and dissatisfaction at the type of work that was available in Sydney. In my previous career as a Software Developer mostly as a consultant working for Financial and Banking institutions.  hour days were short days and the one hour commute each way was slowly driving me insane. The work itself was fairly boring only made interesting by sloppy sales managers whod over promise and wouldnt really care about how it was delivered  only that it was. Effectively I rarely saw my wife and when I did it was over the glare of my monitor as I told her I couldnt go out this weekend because I needed to work. One day while sitting on my drab grey train at pm at night I thought stuff this and decided to look elsewhere. I tried a few other things before getting into Teaching. I thought about Teaching at University but after talking with friends in that industry I came to the realisation that their job wasnt really to teach or make cool things it was really to write papers about cool things. Teaching and making were by far secondary issues for Academics. I also tried other areas of Software Development but they all kind of sucked. So I took a chance and enrolled in postgraduate Teaching qualifications and from the moment I walked into a classroom I fell in love. The kids coworkers  the way of designing lessons to all come together in a way that is meaningful seeing progression in my kids and being able to work on wicked cool things that excite and create passion for the students in my classes. gt What have been the high points of being a teacher?Having kids blow my mind with the things they produce. Just right out of left field technology implementations that are just seriously interesting. Some of the stuff are things that they can take into University and build upon. Fantastic stuff. gt ...The low points?There are a few. For me is when youve got a student whos coming apart at the joins and not because its their fault because because the universe seems to hate them. The worst was a beautiful and bright student who self harmed at school. Self harmed is a fairly PC term for cutting your wrists you almost amputated your hand while doing it. Nobody knew that she was in that much pain. Luckily through the grace of whatever you choose to believe in God Buddha Thor the FSM or just the fantastic skills of the Ambulance and Medical personal she managed to pull through. gt What advice would you give to new teachers?. Steal knowledge from everywhere. Got a question ask somebody. . Dont join in on the office politics. It not only wastes your time but it really helps create negative attitudes. . If you live in a country that has periodic stand down periods where you continue getting paid treat it like a stand down period. Use some of it as lesson planning. gt What should new teachers focus on most?. Are your students learning? I embed formative assessment in every thing I do so I can monitor what seems to work and what is failing to work as intended. . Is your work load high ridiculous? If so what can you do to mitigate against it? In my case I was giving too many assessments that required a tonne of marking time for me to complete it. I refactored this process and now have a lot of assessment that is either self marking automated testing in software development or is presentationexpo orientated. It gives me a lot more time and means that I can go deep on the heavy weight assessment. gt What is your teaching philosophy?Broadly speaking I think that students learn best when they understand what they are learning and why they need to understand it. Because of that a lot of my classes are focused in building a Situated Learning environment. Situated Learning is an approach that tries to make people learn in their final environment doing things that they might do in that industry. Architectural students learn by doing architectural like tasks in an environment that is set up like an Architectural studio. Well I do something similar in my classes. At first its a fairly standard process like any kind of instructional coursework and as we progress through it becomes more studio like with more project oriented learning opportunities. Fundamentals are taught formally expanded in small projects and then iterated along with an intermix of video learning and student learningteaching projects. ,Teachers,coysqr3,2,t5_2qqcs

3261028,0,t3_2xgt6d,Our innercity school has TEN days of PD before school starts as of this school year and three throughout the year  comes of being labeled failing.  We have  minutes a day of statemandated PD MTh after the kids leave.   Last week  of our teachers  thats a THIRD of the faculty pool  was in preAP training for TWO DAYS while subs crawled the hallways and crammed the faculty lounge.   Implementing every new idea would require  hours a day of trial and at least an extra hour a day of planning for something weve never done before to be implemented  and observed in learning walks  within a week of its being taught.  Add this to the  days of MCAS state testing retests that will have been mandated for me as test coordinator to staff and train so far this year which takes at least a dozen teachers out fo the classroom each time to run the testing and as much as  kids of  out of the classroom for the day to take the tests.  Add the upcoming trial tests for all th and th graders that the state is using to test run the new model state test and the  days of state testing to come for all th graders.  Our teachers are in the classroom an average of  of the time.   Even before we factor in our low attendance rate our kids lost  days a year to testing and as of two months ago our kids are pulled for state testing tutoring in math DURING CLASSES  at least three kids per class per BLOCK all day.  Developing classroom norms and rituals under these circumstances is quite literally impossible so we all fail our observations in that category.  Being there as a teacher and using that time to teach what we already KNOW works for these students in this classroom is down to less than  of class time overall.

I dont know hold it up in the corner or something. But unless there is a safety threat inside the building I dont see why students should be confined to their classrooms for seven hours. If there is a threat inside the building current police policy developed after Columbine dictates that police will not form a perimeter and wait. Theyll fucking enter the building and take down the threat. So a seven hour lockdown shouldnt happen. Period.That said because police will enter a school armed with their first priority to neutralize a threat you better believe that letting kids out of the classroom during lockdown is a serious threat to the safety of children. I would not do it. Someone in the area calls for sheltering in place. Which means class goes on as normal but no one leaves class. Because you dont know what in the area means. Two blocks away? On the playground? Are there windows into the classrooms where a stray bullet could hurt someone? What about lunch?  hours has got to encompass lunch unless its already been had. A lot of my kids if they dont eat lunch they dont eat that day. And one day without food isnt going to kill anyone but it can be pretty miserable. There are just too many variables. I cant say what I would do because I dont know the specifics. Likely administration didnt know them either. What I would try to do if I was administration is escort each class one at a time through a hallway without windows to a bathroom every two hours or so. If we had the supplies Id ask the cafeteria to provide sack lunches and deliver them class by class. If I was a teacher Id sit my butt down and stay the fuck put. Because I would know that I had no idea if it was safe or not to let my kids go to the bathroom and hell will freeze over before I knowingly send my kids into a situation that I think might be life threatening. ,Teachers,cp4rjo7,2,t5_2qqcs

The left side is something creative that the students generate graphic organizer pictures explaining concepts creative writing to explain the concept etc.  The right side is notes that we generate as a class or that I give them as direct instruction cornell notes from a reading notes from observations of a demo or video etc.The first set of pages of a unit is always the same.  The leftside is reserved for a concept map that links all the vocabulary of a unit together and is done at the end of the unit.  The right side is a topic and vocabulary list used as a preview of the unit and as a sort of checklist study guide that they used to make sure they are prepared for the unit test.  Next year I plan to also include on the right side a template for students to record graded assignments and their score for each assignment in the unit.The whole leftsiderightside thing is an AVID deal.  I like the idea of each concept having a teacher input section and a student output section however I plan to swap those two pages next year.  The original intent is a leftbrainrightbrain analogue which I feel is BS anyway and in practice what happens is handfuls of students open the notebook and start their class notes on the left since its always the next blank page then end up putting their creative element on the right and thus have their pages backwards from everyone else.,Teachers,cp8q8fz,1,t5_2qqcs

This year the FreshmenJuniors have their own Chromebooks they purchased through the school yes they get to keep those when they leave while SophomoresSeniors are using department class sets that get wheeled in and out of classrooms.  Next year theyll do the same thing for the FreshmenJuniors and the whole student body will have them and then from then on only Freshmen classes will have to purchase them when they enter the high school.  The pros are that students can look things up midlecture and educate themselves class collaboration is very easy and every worksheet goes away because all that has to happen is sharing the documents via email and they just have to fill in the blanks or type their responses.  They cannot lose an assignment because its always in their folderemail history.  Its a powerful and wonderful toy tool that can be used wonderfully in a driven students hands.The con is that students can look things up midlecture and distract themselves.  I cant stress this one enough I stood at the back of the classroom and watched as half the classroom in one class was playing  and any other number of games during a review session for a final as well as during a presentation by their fellow students no shame what so ever.  Of course even those who hadnt done this were getting distracted because it is quite easy to see whats going on one desk in front of you.  Theyre a computer a student can do almost anything on unless the teacher is spending their time monitoring every screen continuously which doesnt make much sense.  Students were using the chat feature on Google Docs so much in one freshman class one teacher had to request that the principal shut the feature off entirely.  If an entire school is using the wifi at the same time responsiveness is going to be sluggish going.Now your schools options sound interesting  either check outin at the beginning or end of the day or in every classroom.  Since I bounced around all the classrooms in my department I can tell you the classes where they were less problematic were the ones where each student had their own.  Having to wheel in a cart and unplug each Chromebook and then plug them all back in at the beginning of using them and then at the end of class took a lot of wasted time out as students searched for that particular one they just liked using or wanted and caused  minutes of downtime a piece as well as the time the teacher had to waste rolling in one of those container carts from one of the offices where they would charge and rolling it back at the end of the period.  The drawback on those that had personal ones is that since they would take them home and use them theyd sometimes forget to charge them and then there was disruption in having to allow them to sit near an outlet in a classroom that was never designed for that many electronic needs.  If more than one or even two needed to charge things had to get a little creative.  If I had to pick between the two options you are suggesting I would have them check inout at the beginning and end of the day just to minimize down time and since you are doing the charging on site that should solve that issue.Edit I should point out I am very much on the fence when it comes to the usefulness of computers in the classroom at all times.  I tend to think that for research purposes for working on papers and essays then they are very useful.  I was the kind of student who in college chose to take notes by hand and used my phone to look up relevant info to the lectures I was in so I can see the benefit of being able to look things up when learning about it but there is a huge swath of students who wont and dont do that.  Then there was a guy who was a senior who took notes on an Ipad by using the drag method on the keyboard which we had to check on he was a very good student but initially it just looked like he was scribbling or playing a game on it before we checked him on it.  Its a crap shoot.,Teachers,cpyqiha,2,t5_2qqcs

3632255,0,t3_31ypn8,Hello!  Im a math teacher at a Title  high school teaching exclusively Geometry this year but I have taught Algebra  and Calculus in the past.  I will tell you right now at the outset that the cumulative curriculum is one of the biggest challenges in teaching math particularly in Algebra  and something that we ALL struggle with.  The sad fact is that we cant get everything right.  There just isnt enough time in the year to remediate every skill gap teach all of the gradelevel content AND do it all in a way that our students come away liking or at least not hating! math and having some realistic sense of why its valuable.  You will have to break some of the promises you made to yourself about the kind of math teacher you wanted to be and make some compromises.  What exactly you end up compromising on is ultimately up to your professional judgment about your students needs but I can give some advice. Dont spend time reteaching arithmetic skills including arithmetic involving fractions and decimals instead encourage students to use their calculators even for simple operations that they should know by heart.  Im assuming here that students are allowed graphing calculators on their state exams as they are here in NY.  Chances are your students have no idea how to addsubtractmultiplydivide fractions or in even whole numbers in some cases.  Thats a sad commentary on our education system but theres little you can do about it at this stage without sacrificing the core gradelevel content.  By letting them outsource the arithmetic you free up both time and cognitive resources for the algebra concepts.. Speaking of calculators make sure every student in your class uses a graphing calculator early and often.  If you dont have a class set of calculators see if there is grant money available Title  schools sometimes have access to random funding streams earmarked for things like technology.  Try to teach as many tricks and shortcuts using the calculator as you can!  In my experience kids like these they think theyre getting away with something and a surprising amount of algebra questions can be answered easily by a student who is facile with their calculator.  In particular students should be very familiar with the GRAPH WINDOW and TABLE screens or equivalent.. You dont have to cover every piece of content in the curriculum but you should be strategic about what you dont cover.  You owe it to your kids to make sure they are fluent in what I would call the core skills of algebra understanding the concept of a variable solving equations linear equations and other basic graphs polynomials and factoring.  But there may be other topics that you can safely skip or cover in less depth standards which are less frequently assessed on state exams and which do not have strong connections to future math classes.  Note that I am not endorsing the above suggestions as best practices teaching in an ideal world they are compromises for a reason!  Given more time we would certainly want to push all of our students to a deep conceptual understanding of standard and notsostandard arithmetic algorithms and these in turn would help deepen their grasp of algebra.  But in the real world we have to make tough choices and I think its better to make those choices thoughtfully rather than just chug along through the curriculum until we run out of time. I will also say that April seems pretty late in the year to be doing linear equations.  Im not sure what your state standards are like but ideally by this point in the year wed want to be up to polynomialsquadratics or so.  That said there is room for professional judgment here and linear equations are a core skill for future math classes so it may be more important to get a higher rate of mastery here than push forward into a new topic.Best of luck and keep reminding yourself about how much more math your students know now than they did at the beginning of the year.  Youll be surprised how much that helps.,Teachers,cq6azq3,6,t5_2qqcs

That being said you do not deserve to be treated the way you are regardless of what happened in the meeting. Have you spoken to your department chair about the situation? Maybe your dept chair can give you better insight on how to figure out what the best steps are to fixing the situation and how valid the assistant principal was in his concerns.

3763067,0,t3_33ibw0,Generation MillenialBenefits Tons of possibilities  particularly a lot of nowcost interactive opportunities that didnt used to be available. For example I teach geometry and if I want to demonstrate constructions to my students I can do it using interactive notebooks SmartNotebook or Prometian or by creating an app Geogebra Desmos etc. and save cost on demo versions of things like huge whiteboard compasses. Communication  used to be that teachers had to print off weekly or biweekly progress reports to communicate with parents. Now I just post info online and they view it at their leisure. No pressing need to facetoface scheduled meetings with email.Detriments Pathetic lack of training. Even coming fresh out of college where they showed us some of the latest gadgets and made us practice I still do not have the knowledge and skills to create or find things with any kind of efficiency. Schools spend hundreds of thousands buying us fancy tools because theres grant money available but almost no time or money teaching us how to use what they buy. Socioeconomic inequality tech is a great tool FOR THOSE WHO HAVE IT but for all our time and effort spent trying to use it there is little attention paid to how we support students who cant get it. I work in one of the wealthiest districts in the state and I have  kids without internet. Im supposed to go paperless next year and that means virtual distribution of EVERYTHING. How do these kids keep up?Change I embrace it but it also overwhelms me. Mostly because a lot of ed. tech. is not user friendly. Grades require about  minutes to record on paper in a hard copy gadebook but almost x that online because of the loading times and number of clicks I have to go through. Its touch not to be overwhelmed when every little mistake costs you  minutes that you are probably not paid for.Notes Pen and paper all the way... but mostly because I dont have anything with a touch screen yet. Im a doodledrawer and the linear format of all my current devices is a major restriction.Additions or changes to a piece of tech Given any option I would like for my stupidass SmartBoard markers to have fine points on them instead of making bulkyass crayola lines. I am constantly frustrated trying to write large enough that all my lines dont blur together while writing small enough that a whole math problem can fit on the screen. I often switch to my oldschool whiteboard out of pure frustration.Event Not a single event but the worst interaction I have is with email. I am constantly anxious over what I will find there. In teaching unlike business every problem is MY problem and most complaints are complaints about ME. It is anxietyinducing to have to open up email to do my work never knowing when the next nasty parent email is going to come. It doesnt happen that often but the threat of it is ALWAYS there. On a more positive note creating applets in desmos and geogebra is extremely fun and on the rare occasion when I have time to play around I have a hell of a good time thinking of new ways to present content.,Teachers,cql7umy,1,t5_2qqcs
3768806,0,t1_cqlnbxe,Im working with a first grader right now who I feel might be a budding sociopath. He is up for another psych eval soon and I am very interested in what comes up. He is diagnosed ODD but Im positive that there has to be something more going on. He has no emotions good or bad. He frequently harms the other students in the classroom particularly the kids who tend to have strong responses and he just stares at them with this curiousfascinated look and a little smirk. We have ball chairs  in our classroom he has lost his because he could not safely sit on it and his newest attention seeking activity is to find an empty chair ball turn it upside down hop around the classroom and launch himself into the other students. When he did this the other day I  took the ball from him then went around the room and took up every empty seat and put them behind my desk. We now have a rule that when you get up from your seat you put your chair behind my desk. He just stood there staring with no emotion on his face but he was breathing a bit heavy for about  seconds. Then he walked calmly to go do something else he shouldnt be doing. It is a strange feeling to think these things about such a young child. Everyone involved with him at school has to keep scrupulous notes about his behavior so hopefully if there is something going on they will catch it now and he can start some kind of treatment. ,Teachers,cqlvdqn,6,t5_2qqcs

3907004,0,t3_3558g3,Career private school teacher here   years in  Catholic schools.For me there are several reasons why I chose to teach in a private school. For the most part the students are here to learn.  I have a great deal of respect for those who can teach in a public school  I tried it as a longterm sub for  months when I first began teaching.  Its not for me.  I got into teaching because I wanted to do just that  teach.  I cant imagine a situation where my students might not want to be in school at all and I dont think I would last long at a school where students would rather just exist than apply themselves.  I sometimes wish I was made of the same stuff as some of these amazing public school teachers I read about who dedicate themselves and push and push and reach some of their students and make a difference. Thats not me. In the area where I live many public school systems have rules that just dont make any sense to me.  One local school system does not allow teachers to deduct points if a student chooses not to do homework.  Another allows students to turn in assignments any time even on the last day of classes.  Add to that all of the hoops that public school teachers are made to jump through every dayweekyear  not for me thanks. I dont have a union where I work most private schools dont. While that offers some disadvantages no collective bargaining for salaries or leverage or tenure it also offers some freedoms.  Freedoms which are to me more desirable.  For example I wanted to organize a trip to rural Virginia to help in home construction.  I asked permission from the principal and just did it.  There was no paperwork no worries of establishing a precedent or any union BS  I just took  students on a weeklong trip to a different state with the permission of their parentsguardians of course and that was that. The parents of my students are almost to a one VERY supportive and active and in favor of almost everything I do. I have great relationships with them and I communicate often but they prioritize their childs education because they have the means and the time I get that many innercity parents do not have the time or means to be involved with their childs education.  I have also rarely been blamed as the reason a student was not doing well in class.  This gives me leverage to use on difficult students and helps me to get some of them motivated. As scary as it sounds to say that I could be fired for cause or not asked to return and that there is no opportunity for tenure I think that for me this is an extra motivation to never become complacent in my teaching.  I want to always be considered a valuable resource for my school so I attend conferences take courses try to innovate and I am supported both philosophically as well as financially by the school at which I work.  This is a luxury that I am continually thankful for because I AM paid less than a public school teacher but I dont have to pay outofpocket for supplies or professional development.That was much longer than I intended.  Please understand that those are MY reasons for teaching in a private school.  I know that its not for everyone just like public school education can be as rewardingbeneficialfun.  Its a personal choice.TLDR  Im a better private school teacher than I am a public school teacher.,Teachers,cr1msqv,12,t5_2qqcs

I have finally realized that students currently in high school have never been without their phone. They only know whats it like to have it. Their parents dont understand this and they do not know how to TEACH them to moderate their use. These kids arent learning when its appropriate and not appropriate to use their phone. Once I realized this I changed my daily mantra. Instead of berating them for being rude or just getting angry I started to explain to them that me standing at the board is an indication to put away the phone and earphones. Every time I started class I would say I am starting class now and this is the time to put the phones away.  I said this EVERYDAY for weeks before I noticed a difference but wow!!! There are still students that need to be reminded occasionally or everyday because they have an addiction but my stress on the matter has gone from  to  in a matter of months. No research on this but just my experience in a classroom of struggling andor special education students.

I dont recall anyone dying for lack of that ability. What about preparing them for the workplace? Can a bus driver a surgeon or a police officer text while performing their duties?

Sometimes when grading piles up or I know I will be stressed for time I use in class discussion prompts or student led activities. That way I can grade their discussion as it is happening. I put a check mark next to each students name as they make a good point and only interject as a facilatator. In the end the only grading is counting up the check marks and scoring them relatively to one another.

Nevermind that it was  years later and in a totally different part of the country.

Mom pulled the kid out for days at a time without an excuse. With two weeks to go she called for a meeting with the principal some district bigwig and my teaching partner. Her newest claim was that her kid was bullied all year long by a few kids in the class and that she would sue the district unless these kids were suspended from school that instant.We didnt see the kid until a week after that. Kid spent most of her time away from the classroom after that even joining my classroom for activities instead of her own.

This last one is particularly difficult for me but I am still working on it and getting better every year.  I  think the MOST important thing to remember is BE CONSISTENT!  Sounds simple but it is harder than you think.  Plus LOTS of repetitions with your expectations and routines! The second thing I want to say that others have not yet is a rule of thumb I was once told.  You have ten minutes per grade level to hold their attention until they need to move or have a brain break.  Remember these kiddos are  and  years old in the beginning of the year.  You have ten minute increments.  Second grade has  minutes and so on.  Lastly in first grade they already love you and they love to learn.  After Halloween keep it consistent but now you can have some fun learning together in the safe space youve created.  Good luck amp remember you can do this! PS. You have a lot of power in first grade. Please model for them that making mistakes is natural and a great way to learn that boys can like pink girls can like math sports and legos and that asking questions and seeking answers can be fun and cool.  ,Teachers,cshx90a,3,t5_2qqcs

Every year a charter HS in my city starts with  students in their freshman class which by the time they graduate that number becomes  or so.  Some of this is due to kids moving however a lot of it is due to expelling students back to their original district.  I have also been asked NUMEROUS times to fudge grades for students who were failing by a large margin... not by their parents by the guidance counselor and principal.  We blatantly picked and chose kids to take state exams often forcing the kids to take the exam again even if they passed the st time.  Charter schools usually also have a much longer work day and school day students at the HS I mentioned are there from  the teachers  although for a long time many teachers stayed until .  Because of this you have an enormous amount of turnover the hours the workload all the requests for fitting in just one more thing for the students... it really wears a good teacher very thin after a short period of time.Source I was a teacher at aforementioned charter school for  years.,Teachers,ctc1os7,11,t5_2qqcs

Anyone who has an interest in creating a new profitable privatized market in which workers teachers can justifiably be paid the absolute minimum wage. Just another step in turning the middle class against against itself in order to further dismantle it.

4940862,0,t3_3ikxwj,Well your Adminbehavior plan is the problem. At my school kids get an administrative consequence for fighting ranges from Saturday school to suspension  there are some options and they generally get suspended if they fight repeatedly especially if they dont participate in Restorative Justice. If your school actually wants to limit suspensions and increase parental involvement the RIGHT way they could try RJ. It works. But it only works if the parents and students are willing to do the right things  it provides options to suspensionsSaturday schoolISS. But the parents have to take the options and the students have to change the behavior. Thats a schoolwide thing though.I mean I dont think you can really handle this mindset as a classroom teacher with no Admin support or consequences. It sounds ridiculous if Admin is involved you mention your AP and has no plan to deal with it. You could look into the kinds of Restorative Justice you could have in the class and try a class circle or something where you all discuss nonviolence but I dont have high hopes itd work without a school culture behind it. For years I taught kids who had the same mindsetparents too but when they hit back they got a consequence. An administrative one. I mean you could assign consequences like time outs detention call home and talk about how it disrupted academics etc. but it doesnt sound like itd do any good. As to reasoning with them I gave that up. I always get kids  even now at my suburban A  when we go over the District Rules about what self defense is shielding yourself and isnt hitting back on the Day  district PowerPoint say My Mom told me to hit back if I get hit or Thats bogus if someone hits me Im hitting them back. Even nice kids! I also understand that especially teenagers hormones! but in all people its kind of a natural reaction to lash out at someone who punches you. Fight or flight. When this inevitably happens this year too in a suburban A Advanced class was where I showed that particular slide I usually make it like a playful but stern comment during the PowerPoint about how I know its fight or flight when you get hit but you better chose flight because otherwise youll be in trouble too. Its your choice to get suspended or not. And then I move on. But thats only possible because my district actually enforces nonviolence. ,Teachers,cuhc2c8,9,t5_2qqcs

I can see the pickup bin being something that breaks the flow of your room as students are waiting in a line.All I do is collect work in a bin. They turn into the bin. Its become such a habit now that they are turning in testsquizzes into the bin when I explicitly ask them not to. I empty the bin at the end of the day or each period if theres a long assignment that I think someone might try to...borrow.I clip all of the work for a period together and put a postit on it To grade ltperiodgt and just put it on my desk or into my bag. Once graded I will hand the assignment back. I imagine putting them into their folders might take some time but who knows?For makeup work I just have a bin with filefolders that are labeled with the day First of the month second of the month etc. If students are absent they check this. If they dont check it then to bad so sad. They know full well that they need to get makeup work this is high school. When they turn it in late to me Ill say something like This is late and they remind me they were absent. I can easily check their absences and confirm. This isnt really a hassle since I usually have only  absent in a day max. Even if it were more its just a couple of clicks.I keep lesson plans in multiple places. A flash drive. A hard drive. A folder. A binder. The FOLDER is for administration to look at. The binder is for me as it includes the original worksheetsactivities. I used to hang the folder up in class and say There it is but now its just in a drawer and the admin. needs to ask me for it. If Im teaching a lesson its not uncommon for them to wait a couple of minutes for a pause and ask.As for syllabi parent contact etc. I keep that in a filing cabinet. I have a file folder for each thing separately and each class has their own hanging folder. Its not alphabetical or anything but if I really NEED the information I know its there.

I put colored pencilsmarkers into smaller plastic pencil boxes labeled  as well so I can put them on tables for groups or pairs. I set this up once and it stays that way because whenever we get something out we also put it away. My th pd. is in charge of helping with this. My st pd. is in charge of helping me get things out. Even when I taught Kindergarten the kids were in charge of this stuff. Theyre much better at it than me at least some are. I set up the system and they use it.As to my desk I use turnin bins for student work per period. I use a second bin on top of the first to return work. I have a letter organizer for copies I made early where I stick those. Nothing else is really a Thing for me  I keep as little in the way of physical paperwork as possible and keep  of things that arent printed out for the kids digital cant wait till the kids all have laptops and can submit through a Google Drive. I even scan in model papers PD paperwork I like etc for posterity. I dont keep paper. I can much more easily organize digital files into folders. Thats really my secret. ,Teachers,cv27oy8,1,t5_2qqcs

5288103,0,t3_3nf27f,For classes where the majority of kids are failing you need to adjust how you are teaching.  I had a class like yours last year and I decided to begin spoon feeding them the lessons.  We worked together for every single lesson for a while.  This required me to recreate the assignments so I could project them on the board while we worked and it was an exhausting period every single day...but after a VERY short time surprisingly short time the kids were getting it.  They were feeling successful for the first time ever and eventually I was able to ween them off the spoon feeding and give them more and more to do on their own.  It was so tiring but totally worth it at the end especially considering the fact that as they began to experience success their behavior became way better too.When people ask me if I get bored teaching the same subject all day long they have no idea that I may be teaching the same concept to the same age group but every single class period has to be presented in a totally different way to meet the needs of those kids.Good luck.,Teachers,cvnm8j2,10,t5_2qqcs
5291053,0,t3_3ngika,Make the students responsible for their own learning. Put them in groups but make each member responsible for a different element of the assignment. You would be amazed at how well students police each other. I make sure to tell my students th and th grade English that this is the only way they will be getting information and that their classmates are depending on them to get the information right. I like the idea of worksheets that someone else mentioned. Create some guided notes or a worksheet that the group needs to complete but make each member responsible for a different section. Then the group shares their work and the other members can fill their sheets in with the rest of the information. This forces students to work and it makes them feel like they are doing less or getting away with something because they didnt have to do the rest of the sheet. That doesnt mean you stop lecturing it just means that you only lecture of certain topics and let them flesh it out. Also a note on homework and books dont accept late work. I give my students a zero for any late homework. And I make no exceptions. They know this and I only ever have  or  students not turn something in. Once they see how a zero impacts their grade theyll shape up. Similarly make having a textbook a participation grade. Dont have your book? Get a zero participation grade for the day. I do the same with my students and SSR books. We have block scheduling so I only see them every other day. So I have my participation span two weeks which equals five class periods. Dont have your book one class period? Thats  of your participation grade gone. I also give them an alternative assignment. No book? Then you get to read this short story and write a paragraph about it. And on top of that you need to compete the assignment we were doing in class for homework  which will you guessed it be a zero if you dont bring it in next class. This all does require work on your part but the results Ive had are worth it. Be firm and unyielding in your rules.

Maybe youre speaking faster than you think my personal problem. Maybe they cant see visual instructions or cant hear auditory instructions. Maybe they have issues with language processing in general. If its none of those things the kid talks during instructions  tamp that down right away btw  and is just messing around then implement what you wanted to do. I usually say something along the lines of I answered that three times already.

Im a certified teacher but not in sped. and have just spent the past week in a special needs classroom. They have a teacher and a para in the room and asked for a third person. Im fortunate and humbled that the main office thought enough of me to ask if Id be wiling to help out for a few days which is expanding into next week while they hire another fulltime aide. In fact they asked if Id be interested in applying but thats another story.Even as a fully qualified middle grades teacher I am not prepared or qualified  to make decisions about the education of these particular middlegrade students. The teacher has been doing this for decades the para for many years. On top of that they know these students  their needs their potential their IEPs and s their personalities their triggers. There is no way I was going to be so arrogant as to walk in there and say Hi Im a teacher so Ill just jump in. Yes of course I tell them Im a teacher. Yes I tell them my certifications so if they happen to need specific help in that while Im there I can give it. Yes I tell them about my history with special needs children in my family and circle of friends. But then I ask them How can I be most helpful to you? What would you like me to do? If that means grading papers I grade papers. If it means accompanying a student as he does his morning rounds collecting attendance cards and taking them to the office I do that. If it means playing Dump the box output the things back in the box for an hour with a very sweet but profoundly needy child I do that.A special needsspecial edwhateveryourlocaltermis classroom isnt a normal classroom and you shouldnt expect to breeze in and start teacherlevel work.

If there were a second teacher available theyd probably get their own classroom with a para.

A lot of teachers fully support us and are so excited to have the arts back in schools but there are also the teachers whose attitude towards us is like poison to the program.My advice would be to communicate and foster an environment of teamwork. Talk to the other teachers at your school and let them know how important their support is to the success of your program.

If it seems homogeneous specifically young white and alt certified without classes outside of the four big content areas then they should be red flags you should shy away. MATs.... eh... vary from place to place. I got an M.

If you are trying to decide between history and math and teaching in general there are a few things you should think about. . Are you wanting just a plain history or math degree or a teaching degree with your content focus being mathhistory?. There is a difference between loving math because your good at it and loving it because your passionate about it and want to get your students passionate about it as well.. Do you have any support from people in the proffesion already in math and history?. If you liked elementary kids that is an elementary ed major. You do not need to pick a certain subject for that. If you want to focus on math or history and just teach that then get some time in a middle or high school and see if you like that age group.You dont necessarily have to respond to me but at least give these things a thought.

5591979,0,t3_3rphpq,Was this a sudden change? My first thought when reading this was what is happening at home? Then I read that part about not being able to contact his parents. Sometimes students who have absolutely no power or choice about what is going on at home feel the need to take the power elsewhere. This andor they are not getting attention at home and all of these behaviors are attention seeking.I totally understand your concern but unless there is any shred of evidence he is in danger or being harmed at home you only have control over what happens in the classroom. What exactly did you try? Did you try a positive behavior plan where he can work for something he really enjoys based on only his positive behaviors? Like a token reward system?It is clearly attention seeking behavior give him a LOT of attention when he is doing the right thing. A TON of attention for literally anything positive you can find. Make it clear he will not get attention when making bad choices. When you make a good choice Ill come back. Dont try to explain what he is doing wrong he knows like you said he is laughing because he is getting what he wants. This is also why he waits for someone to look at him while he is signing and screaming and why he does a negative behavior until you get near him. You need to teachshow him the right way to get attention. Also giving attention to those negative behaviors by giving him a time out might also be feeding into it.Instead ignore it unless it is a matter of safety and praise other students for doing the right thing. Tell other students wow I LOVE the way you followed my direction and only took one pump of soap! You should be really proud of yourself! When you ignore behaviors they will get worse before they get better.If his screaming singing and tantrums get louder which they most likely will try to have the class leave the room. Maybe bring them out to the playground. Have one adult stay in the room with him but completely ignore him. When he stops then go over to him and say now that you are doing the right thing I can come over and talk to you.Try giving him more choice in the classroom. Make him feel like he has some power.Maybe once his behaviors are under control and he trusts you and gets the attention he feels he needs he will talk about his home situation.Sorry if this isnt what you were looking for! ,Teachers,cwq8k62,2,t5_2qqcs

No parent involvement horrible student behavior and administrators that were fired midyear because of their lack of ability to control their own schools. Second school was in a super rich area with parents always worried about their snowflakes. Literally every day he had multiple emails asking what he was doing wrong because their precious kids did not have an A. Students lacked common sense and a work ethic. It was really not rewarding and he switched schools this year when he was vetted for a new school that was being opened. He now has kids who work hard and parents who are supportive but he also has administration up his butt about constant collaboration and using his own time after school to support clubs and sports. This profession is not easy at all and I think that those that only focus on the positive I am that person.

I only decided on what to do or say  minutes or so before my first class. I had  classes today one th grade two th grade and one th grade. I started with letting the kids share their thoughts and emotions on what happened. We did this in French as my kids English is nowhere near good enough. Im pretty sure they have talked about it in all of their classes but I needed to do it. I needed to talk about it. Those kids I teach to are not always lucky in their lives lots of unemployment in the area. They needed to talk. Mostly they needed to talk about the horrifying details they learned about on the internet sometimes on videos. Then when all was said and done I tried to switch back to English. I showed them the drawing of the peace sign with the Eiffel tower then just the peace sign I talked about how people fought for peace during the Vietnam war then I told them that one singer from back then fought for peace too. I then showed them this video of the guy who showed up with a piano in front of the Bataclan on Saturday and played Imagine. I also had a comic strip which illustrated the song.

Im in my second year of teaching music at the high school level and my first year doing split time at the middle school level.  The biggest thing for teaching music is you have to be fairly certain  that its what you want to do that is likely the same for other subjects as well. I dont know how to play every instrument at a performance level but I know enough about them in order to help a student figure something out. The last two years Ive spent a good amount of time refining and improving on a specific instrument last year I did saxophone this year Im doing trumpet. I would caution against going in to any elective subject if youre not completely passionate about it. Because you are teaching an elective course depending on your counsellors you may have many students placed in your classes that have no interest in learning the music you teach and may even go as far as explicitly stating your subject is stupid theres no point for you as a teacher to be there classical music is dumb and many other things that will make you feel horrible as a person at the end of the day. But if out are truly passionate about it youre confident that music can allow students to connect with a subject on a different emotional level than a lot of other subjects and you can handle the psychological battering ram of teaching a subjective area then you will love each and every day you go in to teach. ,Teachers,cxf3xpu,7,t5_2qqcs

So if youre not a teacher yet it may take you a minimum of  years in the classroom before you can even begin applying for administrative credential programs which can be  years long.As someone else said you need to observe speak with teachers administrators and simply work in a school perhaps a non teaching position to see if its for you. Ive talked to many people whove told me my job is easy because I work  to  and have so much vacation. This couldnt have been farther from the truth. You need to figure out if its what you really want to do and whether you will be happy. People who dont enjoy teaching but may be masters in their content have the roughest time in the classroom because kids catch on very easily and will run you out.

The fact that students feel its worth asking shows how taboo homosexuality still is.ampnbspWhich is at least over here just stating the obvious. Who doesnt know this? Why do people like you insist on making such a big deal out of what is essentially a nonissue? Im genuinely curious. But as AnastasiaMcGill said Im from a fairly liberal area and we grew up never having to care about these things. There is absolutely no taboo or stigma associated with being gayand as I said I have a fair share of awesome gay friends who would never take this gay pride thing seriously. No they arent being oppressed. Ive not met anyone who disparages gays just for being... uh gay? Who cares?ampnbspThe best answer I have for your question is that my LGBT peers dont talk about their sexuality in public not because they are afraid of the repercussions of revealing something so trivial but because it is so trivial that they do not feel the need to mention it especially when it is irrelevant to a discussion. I love olives and would never deny it. But at the same time whether or not someone likes olives also happens to be a fairly uncommon discussion topic so I never get the chance to share that information if I did it would be socially out of place and awkward. Another nonanalogy example If you congratulate gay people for coming out Im sure many find that extremely condescendingsarcastic even. They werent hidden to begin with it just happened to be a statement aka revelation relevant to the current discussion! They dont need to be empowered because they know they are just as human as everyone else without someone having to tell them like the poor lost abused victims they... arent. ampnbspTLDR Cant speak for you but in my experience they dont. ,Teachers,cyd4xte,-2,t5_2qqcs

For instance they would just tell me out loud in front of all their peers that the colour sucked and I need to choose another one. Funnily Ive worn this colour for about two years now and the only change was that Id had it touched up. It really put me off and even though its a small thing made me feel like absolute shit especially when they used the time reserved for asking questions about the material to ask about my hair. Im short so they also comment on my height. Ive felt quite pushed around by a few of them especially those who seem to use their height advantage over me like physically crowding me leaning down into my face to make requests that gradually become demands that kind of thing. So I took advice to wear heels and that backfired when they noticed and made comments about it. Again pretty minor stuff but it really threw me off especially coming from college students.

Before you let them use any type of computeripad you need to set clear expectations for how its used treated. Create a large poster thats visible and refer to it often. For the month these should be reviewed and modeled by you. I usually pick a few students to model both the right and wrong way for the class as well.

In face that year shed already run away a handful of times from home usually heading to her older boyfriends house. Her grandma whom she lived with had no clue what to do so she showed up st period to Jessicas band class one day asking for help. Now this was before school before the first bell had rung so we had a combo of kids coming in to drop off stuff as well as our first period class filtering in. The other director took the mother up to the front of the building to talk with the counsellors but when I started class wouldnt you know it Jessica was gone. Not with her mom which Id assumed. So even with multiple people in the room we managed to have a runner. Our building has several exterior doors so she slipped out and made it a few blocks away to her boyfriends house.

6863009,0,t3_49q5nd,Get advise and help from the teacher in the room and go from there.But since I wanna be part of the conversation Ill share my method too. First if you have any emotion about his comments lock that shit down now.  It wont serve you or him.   Im big and students who point it out generally only do so once.  I make a thoughtful face and say something along the lines of Yup I dont like how youre saying that though its like you want me to feel bad. Shrug But I dont. Sigh and smile  Then if possible I complement them or ask them about something I know is positive for them.  But you have to sell the sincerity.  If its not possible I move on making sure to gain the attention of the other students and ignore them for a bit.  If I can I give them a high compliance low effort task like having them help out in some small way.  When a person does something for you they rationalize that they must like you or they wouldnt do things for you.  If the kid brings it up another time or keeps doing it then we have a private conference and if it keeps up we have a parent conference.  ,Teachers,d0u8d6q,2,t5_2qqcs
6872116,0,t3_49v8c7,Its kind of weird. Im completely out to the world and have been for five years. But Ive also never come across a situation in which my sexuality was a topic of conversation. If I call out a student for calling someone gay or a fag or something I correct them and tell them exactly why its offensive because those words are historically tools for oppression and even if you dont hate lgbt its still spreading the message that the lgbt community is lesser than the hetero community. Theres never been a situation where I felt it appropriate to come out to my students. Im out and if a student asked Id tell them but I dont know if Id officially comeout.Another example I was covering a creative writing class and I was helping a student with their story. In some manor I mentioned the students character in terms of he she or they because I legitimately didnt know the gender of the character. The student verbally thanked me for using they as a pronoun. I gave a knowing head nod and moved on. Why didnt I come out? It wouldve been weird and it would have turned a thoughtful gesture into a conversation about me. If that makes sense...However Im also a building sub without my own classroom. So even though I have a built up relationship with every studentteacher in the school I dont have a formal setting to place pictures of my boyfriend which I would if I had a desk..If you choose to come out to your students do it!

Your main problem here is the social anxiety. There is no reason for you to feel bad for not working for one day or another. Ignore what other PGCE students say about how theyre always working you just do what you need to do. No work means no work! You will often find that trainee teachers tend to overexaggerate exactly how busy they are and say stuff like Ive been up every week until am planning! when they sometimes mean I went to the pub after work left at  got a kebab sat down in front of the TV for a short time and then remembered I had planning. Not everyone is like this by all means but exaggeration seems to come with the territory dont let it get to you.Enjoy days off. You will have many! I personally struggled to enjoy days off and this Easter is the first time I feel like I have struck the correct balance. It will come with time and practice. Make sure you have some friends watching out for you and I find having lunch with friends in holidays a nice way to break up working hours. So  work  lunch out  work.  hour day combined with social stimulus. If you dont want to quit the bar job then you should set yourself goals. You can easily fit in  hours on a lazy Sunday afternoon and just try to keep that time there so you wont feel bad about leaving the house other times or know how you will move it  hour a night except FridayBut good luck.

And having to stay late is a bummer as is working through lunch though when I was teaching at a public charter I had to do that virtually every day too. But I would suggest you consider how many hours youre putting in right now compared with how many hours youd have to put in if you transferred to a school with  kids per class. As for the part about losing your favorite kids...the great kids come and go as do the kids that make you want to tear your hair out. Your current favorites might be leaving but youll have new favorites coming in! And the kids that drive you bonkers will leave eventually. I dont know. I think it would be the same story at a public school youd love some kids and others would make you crazy.Id suggest you crunch the numbers in terms of salary what youre paying for benefits and how many hours youre putting in each day and then try to make a decision from there. Your current situation while imperfect sounds pretty good to someone who just left public school!

If I think the concept is less familiar to them I have the inquiry lab at the end and often structure it like a research project.

7280152,0,t1_d246k0s,Yeah for sure! Our years arent any longer than the other schools in the area so I cant speak much to that. We did start a week earlier though but we get out a week earlier too.I can definitely tell you that the day weekends are MUCH appreciated and I dont know if I could go to a school that has day weeks after being so used to my long weekends. We only have  snow days built in to our schedule whereas the neighboring school has I think  or . Normally when they dont use the snow days they go to day weeks after spring break.We also have longer school days than other schools. The tardy bell rings at  and we go until . I start dragging around  or  so those last couple hours can be kinda hard. If I want to stay after school to work on things I end up staying until dinner most of the time. It was especially challenging during the winter when I would go to work before light and come home after dark. Ick.Besides those logistics the day weeks dont have much impact on my planning. I am still usually able to do most units in  weeks. Trying to fit labs in is challenging sometimes though. I teach science. I have finally gotten my pacing down after spring break. That was tough with this being my first year. Lol avoiding Monday tests can be challenging sometimes too. I havent avoided them completely because of the short weeks.We offer tutoring on Fridays and students who are ineligible that week are required to come. Having the day to do that without eating into Saturday and Sunday is awesome. When there are athletic tournaments on Fridays it doesnt take kids of out of class. Not having to take sick days if I have an appointment is great too. I just schedule them all on Fridays! And the short weeks keep the kids from being TOO tired and cranky at the end of the week. So those are all nice things.So to sum up I love the day weeks. The only real downsides in my limited experience are fitting in labs Monday tests and the longer school day. I hope I helped a little bit!,Teachers,d25pdqg,2,t5_2qqcs

Really research where you want to work. There are a ton of ways to increase your income in addition to teaching. insert argument that you shouldnt have to work more jobs to make more money. Im in a much less common situation than most but my yearly salary is double what I make teaching. I live extremely comfortably between my jobs and then combined with my husbands salary. Im able to travel and experience things I would have never dreamed of back when I was in college. Its definitely possible to have the life you want but sometimes it takes being a little creative. People do it everyday going into education is by no means a death sentence. At the end of the day it comes down to what you value.

Hes a major behavior issue and thoroughly resents anyone who tries to get him to behave properly. He consistently doesnt turn in homework or turns it in half done with random numbers written on it and no work shown and on test days he just sort of sits there for awhile writes a few random numbers and then hands in the test and wants to goof off.

So as long as you have enough college credit hours in the specific field you want to teach enough math college classes for example the idea is they train you on the teaching part. Now some certainly are better at training and prepping you than others  youd just have to do some research and looking around. Once you go through the classes from them youll have to take  tests  one specifically for your content area and then one general one called the PPR  Pedagogy and Professional Responsibility.One all thats done youll go through and do student teaching somewhere for a time yep I know this sentence was super helpful.

If l recall correctly I had a lowtomidB equivalent GPA when I graduated. But I definitely failed one class and had my fair share of Cs. But I went on to earn a BA in physics in college and then a Masters in Science Education focused on teaching physics and Ive been teaching physics for  years. .ish GPA I think? Its been a decade. I dont remember exactly. I really really struggled in some of my physics classes. And with writing papers. I actually write well and tend to get very good grades on written work but for most of my life it felt like pulling teeth. I literally just used to not turn in papers because I didnt want to write them. It wasnt until grad school that it started to come easier.The thing is I had great teachers who encouraged and embraced my curiosity and none of whom made me feel as if my struggles or immature work ethic reflected poorly on me as a person.I dont think its hypocritical at all. After all I am no longer  years old. My brain and all of our brains literally needed another decade to finish maturing just from a biological standpoint. Experience also helps give perspective.

Music can unite people blah blah blah. I went to Catholic school and one cool thing we did was learn a Christmas song in another language one year.

I think uGoatCheese hits the nail on the head by saying we need to decide the purpose of public education. We need to define a clear purpose for all of this learning more than just you should know it or critical thinking teamwork etc. are important skills. I agree that it is daunting to think of adding another layer of assessment on top of an already imperfect layer but in what other profession is performance measured so little as in teaching? And also just because measuring and incentivizing teaching is difficult to do does not mean we should not try. The core of good education is good teaching so we should be trying each and every way to reward and encourage such a thing. ,Teachers,d3p4tgk,1,t5_2qqcs

7808590,0,t1_d3tql50,OP expresses her concern as a direct result of the Principals statement that gtYesterday he called me into his office to tell me that a highly qualified black male teacher applied for the job  and that because the district has a strong drive to create a more diverse teacher workforce he was being considered for the position. Im a white female. The Principal seemingly brought up the diversity policy being an honest sort who had promised this job as administrators often do when they still have to advertise the job.The problem here are district policies that tie Principals hands. What is a better situation for schools? Principals can hire who they think is a good fit for their schools.  Districts interfere with hiring putting candidates in schools that Principals and other staff do not want there due to higher level administrative interventions creating resentment among staff at the school site. Whether the reasoning is diversity or reducing nepotism or anything else Principals should be able to hire the candidates they want. Hiring OP who knows the school and is a known quantity with staff relationships makes total sense. Im against nepotism but these administrative policies to fix those problems generally create more problems. Yes the  day posting is a joke. They shouldnt waste anyone elses time interviewing someone if they truly want OP which it seems like they do. I agree its an administrative error but I think the fundamental problem is the district policy not the Principals actions assuming the Principal hires OP clearly the best candidate as she already works at the school and no qualifications can best that in the end and the interview is a dogandpony show for the district. Edit My district is a large district we are pretty diverse and we have no such policies. There is no pressure to post a job before hiring someone. There is no pressure to hire someone due to diversity. Every teacher costs Principals exactly the same amount of money whether they make the salary of a seasoned  year vet with a PhD or a newbie st year teacher the district pays the teacher the appropriate salary and docks the school a set amount that is the median so Principals have no incentives to hire anyone for any other reason than they are the right fit for the job. This is how it should be. These policies fuck things up. ,Teachers,d3tqywp,5,t5_2qqcs

8071734,0,t3_4pq0oq,It was a while ago but not much has changed....expect nothing to work the way you learn when you study teaching. All the crap in your education degree was made up by academics who probably never taught and it will tell you nothing about actually educating children. The best teachers are the people whom consistently got comments like talks too much in their reports as social skills are vital. More important that being top of course....You cant predict the teachers that will survive. It takes actual grit and plain stupid reluctance to admit defeat and a masochistic streak will probably help. The only thing that matters is relationships and using those relationships to lead those students to taking risks with learning. this takes years to learn to balance but by the end of the first year you will know this in a way you never did before.good teachers can be grown and if you are flavour of the month have compassion. Dont think you are good at your job or better than your more experienced colleagues. They know tips and tricks you will need to survive. Like which office lady will actually put your pay through and how to get photocopier C to work on a Monday morning....

8080578,0,t1_d4o7wj3,This. I worked in edtech for almost a decade. During my last two years at my company it was clear it was going down the drain so I started applying for any number of similar positions at alternate companies. I had one phone interview where the interviewer made it clear they didnt know why they were bothering to talk to me in the first place. I had another phone interview that was going perfectly fine until out of the blue the interviewer interrupted me to say I wasnt qualified and shut the whole thing down no it wasnt something I said. They were looking for something I didnt have on my resume I said no I didnt have experience with it. Thats why it wasnt on my resume bitch what the hell were you expecting? The gall though was that she let the interview continue another ten minutes until letting me know this. The last straw though was when I applied at a hot startup with a grant from the Gates Foundation to do a job that was literally the exact same job I had been doing for six years at my old company. I had three rounds of interviews including inperson interviews and meeting the CEO. Every single one went smoothly they made a lot of noises about next steps...and then they just flat out stopped returning my emails. Finally at the end of my rope and sick to tears of my failing company I applied for a teaching position at a local private high school. They practically THREW a job offer at me and I was in the classroom two months later not entirely sure what had just happened. ,Teachers,d4obyxn,5,t5_2qqcs

8170021,0,t3_4r4o6h,I would suggest preparing your vocabulary. There will probably be some questions about appropriate pronouns descriptions of gender identity and expression sexuality etc.For example in one comment here you mention switching genders. You may want to decide whether you want to express it that way or as matching your gender expression to your gender identity or in another way that makes sense to you. In my experience kids are very inquisitive and tuned to the precision of language when they get their first exposure to these ideas in a real life setting.You should also know which questions you are willing to answer and how personal you will let things get. Dont be afraid to lay out rules for questions. My approach is to ask them to frame their questions in as respectful a way as they know how and that as long as they are doing their best I wont be upset if they slip up Ill just explain how they could phrase things better next time. I also explicitly reserve the right to not answer a question if I feel that its too personal but again without taking offence at having been asked. The kids seem to appreciate the safe nonjudgemental but firm limits.This is coming simply from experience leading a GSA for  year olds and having shared some unrelated personal experiences with my classes.

The after degree is only  years assuming youve filled the major and minor requirements. You may have to take a couple classes to fill those up not sure youll have to check on that so it may take you an extra semester or two. Here is the link to the program As I said above. The after degree just like the bachelors has two student teaching practicums mixed into it.

8259807,0,t3_4shi3y,I was a US Peace Corps volunteer and have been a teacher for  years. The Peace Corps learned early on not to supplant local teachers with outsiders and to build communities with PC Volunteer contributions to local populations.  I served in West Africa in a support capacity to help people in my region obtain resources. My job was an agricultural education teacher trainer for several middle schools where I built demonstration gardens and shared organic gardening practices to yield more crops lessen insects without pesticides and maintain soil integrity. I have taught high school English in the US and overseas for more than two decades. The Peace Corps honed my leadership and people skills but I had an English and English Education degree from a university before my service.  Thus I understand the call to service and to teach. Too often TFA is used to break unions cut the payrolls of experienced teachers cross picket lines staff charter schools and fill hard to staff places. TFA recruits are undertrained and tend to leave after a couple of years. TFA was an idea that probably looked great on paper It was the founders masters thesis but in principle and execution has become a morally reprehensible blackberry bramble. Please on behalf of my teaching compatriots in the field find a good masters program and study the psychology of learning lesson planning assessment literacy policy law different kinds of students Special Ed and English Language Learners and child development. Experience a semesterlong internship in your subject area and numerous observations with seasoned veterans who can model pacing classroom management subject area teaching and engagement strategies. Work with current practicing teachers not against them. I have supervised young teachers in undergraduate and M.SM.EdMAT programs and taught next to temporary TFAers. TFAers are encouraged to seek advice from their trainers and dont always acclimate to a local staff. Likewise some staff members dont always accept a TFA corps member believing that  recent Ed program graduates have been bumped from jobs or that TFAers are not worth investing in because they know it all or will be gone in two years having joined TFA to pay off school debts. Rather than shortcut a career in this rewarding field why not enter the traditional way. Young teachers who go through the appropriate university program credentialing have always fared better in my opinion.  I love this profession and it is a difficult and challenging profession. There are some loan forgiveness and scholarship programs to consider as well. I dont visit a dentist with enthusiasm and just a summer training under her belt and expect professional results nor should society expect that any energetic person with a summer camp of training should be responsible for the future of society. TFA is one of many components that has deprofessionalized the noble field of teaching. We are working to restore its grandeur. There is an impending nationwide teacher shortage and we need sincere folks who are willing to undertake the correct sequence of classes in both their subject areas and current pedagogy. I dont have a problem with teacher shortage areas with alternative credentialing where teachers are mentored in ongoing university programs and working or doing paid internships like doctor residencies. In fact a coteaching apprenticeship model might be the answer to both the TFA conundrum and the teacher shortage. Open the TFA program to Ed program graduates as well as general studies program students. Form partnerships with university College of Ed programs. Permit Ed program participants to be paid for their internships and use the coteaching model pairing TFAers with practicing teachers for their two years of service. Offer the TFAers enrollment in university Ed programs. At the end of two years offer both the traditional Ed program student and the TFAEd program student loan forgiveness on a rudimentary level. After an additional five years offer full student loan forgiveness. This way we will have more longevity several pathways to become a teacher  and we might not lose so many in the first two years of teaching. ,Teachers,d5a17qu,1,t5_2qqcs

Why? Because your philosophy is screw that.Perhaps the student lied because a lot of professors lack compassion to even hear a reason outside of a family member death as being reason for late  and even then sometimes professors can lack understanding.Ive had a biology professor who forced me through a  month appeal because of a family member who died and she wouldnt provide an alternative schedule for an exam. She lost the appeal but I should never have had to appeal when she could have easily been more accommodating.

8605962,0,t3_4xp0q2,Too many times we overly complicate the entire rule business.  It is important as teachers to distinguish between rules and procedures.  Rules are Major offences that will almost always result in administrative intervention.  Things like bullying fighting slander cursing teacherstudents out....major stuff like that.  Sure some of this can be dealt with on a personal level with the student in specific circumstances but in the end this is major stuff that involves severe disrepsect and or endangering the safety or well being of another student.  Procedures however are the other stuff like talking out of turn homework incompletion talking too loud shouting across the room being late making a mess passing notes not listening and about a thousand other things.  As teachers we should not be including procedures as part of our Classroom Rules.Instead procedures should be taught and reinforced regularly and when they are broken a teacher should assume a student means well but just needs more practice mastering the procedure.   In regards to Rules there are only  or  rules and when they are broken the student is clearly aware of the severity of the case.  Administration can deal with the consequences of rules being broken.  You dont have to worry about it.  Write these rules on your Rules poster.  Procedures on the other hand should never be included as part of your rules.  Teach procedures well ever single day and if a student breaks a procedure assume that he or she just needs more practice.  I guarantee the culture of your class will be at all time epic levels if you internalize this frame of mindset.  I wish you all the best this school year.Ramy,Teachers,d6hc934,3,t5_2qqcs

Sometimes Ill add a few things but always with their approval. We decide on a grading scale together.When project time comes everyone turns in their project with a self assessment a blank rubric they fill in their grade and justification for each category. We created this together so nothing should be a surprise for them.Their selfassessment grades are very rarely not onpoint. Kids are very smart and selfaware. If theres a serious chasm between my grade and their own assessment we have a conference but its rare. I usually use their own rubric and mine to grade write a little note about something cool they did keep it unique!! and send them on their way  with this method theyre very rarely surprised by their grade.

But to answer your questionConsider which skills youd like to teach with each chapters. I tend to focus on inferencing citing evidence predicting authors purpose and how authors develop characters. I create worksheets or activities to have the students learn these things. Sometimes I have them read with me to learn the skills sometimes I have them read at home and then reread to learn the skills. I think four weeks is too long especially for Hatchet and A Wrinkle in Time. Ive never read the others. I tend to take about three weeks for novels but I do a few other things during that time too vocabulary some grammar maybe reading some short stories or poetry that ties in either by theme or skill. I would recommend Comprehension Connections which shows you how to teach reading skills via concrete lessons and then transitioning those skills to booksstories.

The best management strategy IMO is establishing routines.  What will you do when they enter the room for class?  What will they be expected to do as they come in?  What should they be doing when youre taking attendance or have a phone call?  How do they get your attention to ask a question or to use the bathroom?  Etc. Basically the more established a routine the less youll be trying to deal with little issues because theres already an established routine for the little stuff sharpening pencils throwing away trash transitions getting outputting away materials.Its a good idea to spend the first day or two depends on your schedule establishing those routines.  Depending on the age of your students theyll catch on andor comply or they wont.  Enlist the help of that one kid theres always that one kid who seems to be testing youmake himher help you somehow.I greet my students at the door every class.  Then they have a warm up question they work on when they come in I collect the answers at the end of the week for points.  They write while I take attendance.As far as other issues proximity andor  conversations usually head off most trouble before it starts.  Be proactive not reactive.  You were a high schooler probably not that long ago so you can anticipate what theyre thinking about doing before they do it.Lastly dont be their friend.  Be a benevolent dictator  ,Teachers,d79nlfv,9,t5_2qqcs

Then instead of counters give each group names of everybody in the class. This would then give the work a more relevant context and you can use it as a way to explain how you might use support staff? Something that was relatively important at least for me in EnglandI dont know if you would be using the word array but is it necessary? It could just be throwing out terminology that maybe not all students will understand. You could then get bogged down in defining it rather than teaching.The term factor might throw up the same issue possibly?Another way of doing it could just be a load of practice on division... Give the groups lists of numbers  maybe to work together on dividing and see if they notice anything special about some of the numbers or can put them in lists i.e. can only be divided by itself and . You could then give them calculators to see if they can find any more they THINK could be prime or to try and find the rest of the primes between .

It only takes one that they take issue with before the conversation isnt productive. And people are human it doesnt even have to be a legitimate issue.  For example maybe they just recently had a bad experience with weddings.  Maybe they just got done paying for one and took a big financial hit.  When you mention needing to save for your wedding their mind zeros in on that and their thought process becomes Whoops doesnt want to do this because of their wedding.  Weddings are frivolous and stupid.  Therefore Whoopss reasoning for not wanting to do this is frivolous and stupid.  Im going to double down and insist they do the play as its much more important than some wedding.  Does that sound fair? No?  Welcome to the world of humans.ubessann hit it perfectly on the head. You have chorus obligations first.  If they push you say you have previous commitments.  Mention the allergy shot appointments first as thats a medical thing and should be protected.

You know what your goal is  what you want to be like and youre just not there YET. If youre a new teacher even if youre in your first five years there are other teachers at your school who have been teaching for as long or longer than youre been ALIVE!

For three years I was a TA in a Title I school in an impoverished area of LA where a lot of kids faced family issues related to gangs homelessness andor hunger etc etc. I can think of exactly one teacher there who I knew still loved her job after twentyfive years. The rest granted I didnt chat much with a couple of them but I got to know plenty were quite done with their job. Most had pretty lousy things to say. Some were even severely unhappy and wanted out but had no plans to do so. One told me dont do it when I told her I was studying to become a teacher.I ended my last year there a month early when I had personal issues come up and I decided the emotional drainage of interacting with these adults was not worth it in the balance of my life at the time.

But thats also because I was at an age where I could set aside my emotion for the sake of my learning. of kids in K and  of kids in  dont have the ability to do this.  And because of this yes you do need students to like you.  This is why relationships are hammered so hard when it comes to management and discipline.  It simply shows in the research.  Last week I went to a longass track meet and saw about  of my students there.   hours that I didnt want to be standing in the cold and rain but went out there cheered on students talked to about  sets of parents that I hadnt got to meet at back to school night and other events.  Parents suddenly think I care about their kids sports I dont really but if it gets them to succeed in school then one night is worth it I get to informally conference with parents about student progress learn more about the family as a whole and students think that Im out there to support them.  Suddenly they come in the next day and were talking about the meet that I couldnt care less about but theyre doing better work than Ive seen all year.

I only became aware of this AFTER the incident described below.In class she is kind of a flirt and liked to banter with a groups of boys.  I moved her away from these boys but she has had a history of warnings in class for minor disruptions  no big deal in an urban school district.Last week she broke my cactus.  She shattered the pot it was in as well.  The class erupted in a chorus of oooohs when they heard the shatter of pottery.  I knew it was an accident so I just moved on.  I smiled at her and asked her to sit down so i could move on with my lesson.  She was trying to defend herself claiming it was not her fault as she said her friend knocked her into it.  I kept saying Ok lets continue.  Sit down.  Finally she stood up and started insulting my plantcare skills.  I will be frank and say that I lost my patience after she said this.  I told her it thought it was extremely rude to break my plant deny responsibility and then insult my gardening skills all the while continuing to disrupt class.  Now I see the glare of hostility in her eyes every time she passes by.  I am not alone in the club.  She has similar hatred for a few other teachers and administrators.  I am just not sure how to proceed.  The way I see it I have a duty to my other students to ensure that learning can occur and disruptions are minimized.  I am prepared to send her away when needed.  But I also feel like she needs some help that I certainly cannot give her.  We do not have a system of peer counselling at our school.  She does have friends mostly other tough girls with whom I get along just fine.  My class rules call for her to write a reflection on how she disrupted class.  I doubt I will get anything.  I never want to write any student off.  But I really dont know how to proceed with this one.  After this incident a former teacher told me that she was sort of like a feral cat and very volatile.  She has been mistreated or rejected by every adult and male I am a male teacher BTW in her life and she appears to be adding me to the list of those that have disappointed her.Any suggestions?  TLDR.  My student is mad at me.  ,Teachers,d8mrxuk,2,t5_2qqcs

Prep periods are eaten up by responding to odd emails per day Im required to attend to some prep period many with requests for data.  So lets start with . hours.  THEN add.... English teacher with a mandate to produce both a separate writing assignment and at least one formative weekly and grade it  for  students per week   hours a week. . Statewatch school requires a particular format of lesson plan  point two full pages has to be unique every day and is actually READ and critiqued by a principal team that takes  minutes per plan to write x  preps on a twoday weekly cycle.   hours a week  plans per week.. Contract mandates after school with kids one day and meetings one day a week.  If my kids are failing though I can get fired so add another after school day...and make both run until    hours a week.. Preparing materials before and after school daily for those  preps with one copier for  teachers and a technology driven lesson format every day  hours a week. Call every student every month mandate  hours a week. Oh youve never taught th grade English before?  New preps every freaking year buildingwide.  Reading the books I have to teach and scouring for new better and supplemental materials  hours a week.  We appear to be up to a  hour week  which divides up as a five day at day or  hour days during the week plus a  hour Sunday prep for lesson plans which have to be emailed in by Monday morning. No one is whining.  Im just counting you utter asshole.  Note I did work with a few folks who have tried grading in class their kids failed and refused to work or insisted on only a  hour a week and then stopped no matter where they were.

9313517,0,t3_5800s3,I teach ELA and SS so I happen to have one particular group for both. We spend over two hours together. Now I know many elementary school teachers do this but its a unique situation in my middle school as most teacher teach one or two periods with one group and I have three. So that particular group naturally gets more comfortable with me and I with them. Ultimately they end up being the group that can make or break my day since  of my teaching time per day is on them.Ive loosened a bit with that group but what I found to be helpful was being very clear with them. About two weeks ago there was a classwide incident with teasing in my classroom. This isnt acceptable. So I nixed my entire end of the day lesson and spent time talking to them. We had a teambuilding activity but then I transitioned.We talked about respect. What is respect? What does respect look like in the classroom? Towards peers? Towards teachers? What is disrespect? What does that look like? Etc etc. This was effective because NOW when they are not following through I can explain that their actions are disrespectful per our conversation. I dont know I found it is be helpful. You might try reiterating the expectations of the classroom yet again mentioning that you understand that they are in a comfortable learning environment but reiterating how crucial it is that this is kept a learning place that is respectful etc. Im a second year teacher as well so I understand the line you are trying to draw and I have found that going this route has been beneficial.

9416551,0,t3_5980ih,I teach th grade so it may be a little different. First semester I absolutely do fail kids. However second semester I look at things a bit differently. Basically I have to ask if failing my class will be the only thing that keeps a student from graduating. If my class is the only thing that would keep a student from walking I will change that grade to a  in a heartbeat. Why? Because not doing your precal homework is not a good enough reason to condemn a student to the life of poverty that not having a high school diploma guarantees. I guess I believe that if failing is in the best interest of the student i.e. If it will hold them back to force them to actually master the material and build a stronger foundation then I support it. But if failing the student would have huge negative effects for that student and I dont mean GPA I mean like the student would have to stay back and this particular kid understood the material the first time just didnt do the work but now will be bored and will stop coming to school and likely drop out or something like that then I say change the grade.,Teachers,d99m3aa,1,t5_2qqcs

It was horrible for so many reasons. I highly recommend never ever making an english only time. Instead treat the Spanish swears as you would English words. In our school the consequence varies. Obviously a kid saying Damn Daniel!  is totally different than calling a teacher what you said.

For each school I have worked at I just turn in a lesson plan book at the end of each quarter.  Just come up with a plan.  When you are teaching typically you have a guide or pace chart.  You follow that.  I typically come up with a plan for the whole semester.  For example if I teach short stories I will chart which short stories I will do for the first five weeks come up with lessons for each one.  For example  Day   Grammar  PreReading Activity for Most Dangerous Game  PreReading Thought Provoking Questions  Day   Grammar  PreReading Discussion  Reading Most Dangerous Game Day  with reading guide questions   Day   Grammar  Finish Reading Most Dangerous Game Day  with reading guide questions  Discussion on the short story  Day  Assessment on Grammar and Most Dangerous Game this is where they show application....... And then reboot with the next short story.  It worked.  Sometimes you modify the days because you might get into a discussion.  I do the same thing with novels but break it up into sections.

9650851,0,t3_5d5vrj,From reading your description and your comments it sounds like you care a lot about working with kids. Teaching is absolutely a thankless difficult career but not every school community grinds their teachers into the ground. Perhaps if you feel strongly about the impact you can have in a classroom you shouldnt quit teaching but instead find a new classroom. Or maybe if high school isnt for you try middle school elementary a nonprofit etc. There are loads of ways you can continue to make a difference in the lives of kids who really need you now more than ever but if your current school isnt a good fit then you should seek work elsewhere. For me I absolutely agree with you . Schools have to play an integral role in mitigating amp explaining the terrifying results of this election and the shitstorm that will be the next  years.

9761726,0,t3_5ezcvg,Dutch maths teacher here what is live marking?I have some experience with letting students mark their own tests instead of me marking it and reviewing the test together. Next week Im going to do this with my current classes. These are highability students last year I worked with averageability classes.I mark the work as usual but instead of noting anything on paper I put the scores per question in an Excel worksheet. It automatically adds op the scores and calculates the provisional grade only for me to see. Then I review a few questions with very low scores with the class.After that the students receive their own work and an answer sheet. They now grade their own test putting their scores on the answer sheet. When students are done they can calculate their grade and then return everything back to me. Students want to know their grade and the only way to obtain it is to check their own work. After that they continue with independent work.After the lesson I compare the students own scores with my scores and review only the questions with a different score. If I dont agree with the student I add feedback on the form or test. If I agree with the students score because I made a mistake I adjust the score in the Excel sheet. After all is done I put the final grade on the test and in the online grade book. The next lesson I distribute the tests for students to keep.Important note I already scan tests before returning them and with this method scanning the work is also important. If students adjust answers and try to give themselves extra points I can catch them. If it seems like I made a mistake I can check back if it was a real mistake on my part. Last year I had three classes with traditional grading and four students in total trying to boost their score this way so its not a big problem.I only allow students to have a redwriting pen or pencil on their desk when they are reviewinggrading their work. This means it takes more effort to change an answer so they should be less inclined to do so.Is this something like you have in mind with live grading? Pros are that students are really reviewing their work and hopefully learning something cons are that it takes extra time to set up and that I have to review tests twice.Bonus tip from the teacher I copied this method from dont let students review the work of others. Students are very interested in their own performance grade but not in the performance of others. So they will take it less seriously and you end up having to correct more scores. And privacy rules probably forbid it.,Teachers,dagcmf6,3,t5_2qqcs

10075085,0,t3_5jzrnq,Okay I teach in LA and went to CSULB so this might be the most helpful.First on the CSET. You either have to take the CSET or go back to your undergrad school and ask them to waive the CSET. Youd go to the education department and get subject matter competency however... Even if your degree is in English that doesnt mean you will automatically have the CSET waived. Because you need to know all types of English required by th grade standards you need a lot of extra classes you might not have taken as an undergrad. Youll either have to take these to get the waiver or take the CSET.Also you can also get the waiver at whatever institution you do your credential classwork so dont worry too much about going to your undergrad institution for that. When applying to the credential program there will be a time when they will check if youre doing the CSET route or the coursework route.Finally your waiverCSET needs to be done before you student teach. So it isnt the most pressing issue until you get into the classroom. But be mindful of scoring dates because you need passing scores before you teach obviouslyNext Ill tell you how you can probably start teaching in a classroom in as little as  weeks BUT two things this is information for Charter schools and they definitely are poorer schools with students of color. Your management better be A to work here you better have the meanest teacher look on the planet for this to work out and if you dont know how to relate to students of color you might as well stop reading. Even all my rich white teachers from LB probably couldnt handle these kids.The charter schools because of their rep and because of the demographics they serve are suffering from teacher shortages even higher than the public schools. So first they need substitutes. I worked for DirectEd which is a company that sends substitutes to charter schools. The good thing about them is that while youre waiting for your sub permit theyll give you other things to do like work in the office be a oneonone aide for a school or even send you to the schools to be a chaperone at events or field trips. Then your permit comes in and this is where the teaching starts.You can then request to be put on a long term assignment which can be anywhere from  weeks to the end of the school year. At the school that I work at there are about  teachers and  of them are long term subs because people with credentials dont want to apply to work in charter schools.Then you can work full time and get experience that will look freaking great on your resume at any school. You will also have a foot in the door for those charter districts in case you want to come back.Finally theres programs like TFA that you can teach while you do your coursework but theres no guarantee youll stay in LA and theres Adelante through the LA based Green Dot Public Charter Schools district which is like TFA but specifically for their schools where you have class after school teach during the day and tuition is deducted from your paycheck over the course of time.Idk hopefully some of that helped.What I did was I taught as a long term sub while doing my coursework but it was easy for me to do that because I was good at management and had a lot of experience working with teens.

10144545,0,t1_dbts2fz,Thank you. I appreciate it and understand. Would you mind telling me where in the country if in the US you work or have worked for the majority of your career? Sure everyones personal life is different but I too would like to start a family and one would think that if the salary of teaching is enough where I dont need to get a nd job having the days off during the year would provide me with more time to my family than I would have in many if not most other professions. I mean Im in the northeast and even if I dont stay in NYC I plan on staying in this area most likely Boston eventually because teachers do fairly well here. I was going for accounting and everything was going great but one day I woke up and caught myself before I got too far in my education to want to turn back and realized Do I really want to work  hour work weeks during busy season? Do I want to bust my ass the entire year and barely see my family? Teaching just made sense based on the salary and benefits. Often I hear people complain about teacher salary. You are certainly right to say that I need to try it out first. Absolutely I dont have first hand experience or knowledge. However teacher salary in specific cities is public record and I can also find out how much teachers make at individual schools in my area by going online. At least its like that in NYC. But point being teachers do okay here. I realize that unfortunately they do very poorly to average at best in other locations. I hope I dont need to get a nd job in the future and regardless of how demanding the teaching profession may be I would like to develop and maintain a solid worklife balance by taking advantage of days off that other professions dont receive.,Teachers,dbtu6du,1,t5_2qqcs
10158329,0,t3_5lghlu,I do everything digitally. While kids type I have my hub and can tap into any of their papers all possible because of my one true love Google. I read what they have add comments and suggestions and keep a running list of people having issues that probably need a second check in from me. I also help on editing using the suggesting mode. Typically I only fix the unfixable or make corrections to things above their skill set. The rest I fix a few and leave a comment to say see how I did this check the rest of your paper and find the rest of these errors and fix like I did here  think like dialogue set up or paragraphs or indenting or wrong word being used.  Either way because when we edit we use the suggesting mode no matter who edits me or a peer they have to approve everything so it gets them thinking about rules and what they wanted etc.Anyway by the time essays are due Ive read most at least twice. I can quickly scan through and refresh my memory and I have very specific rubrics so Im looking for specific things at this point. Like for narratives they had to demonstrate a simile or metaphor and sensory language they highlighted all that for me by color a good revision activity so Im not looking all over its right there. I also do  big essays a year. We do smaller writing throughout working up to a big paper but only  big papers that are final copies for a final big grade it boils down to  topic per quarter research where I primarily focus on research things like paraphrasing summary citations narrative informative and persuasive.I grade no more than  a day usually have  a quarter to grade but two different grades so I stagger as much as possible so both grades arent due on top of each other.,Teachers,dbvi4h2,8,t5_2qqcs

IMO you have two options keep the status quo and keep doing what youre doing and do the best job that you can or try to be friendly with her and make the best of a crappy situation.  Option two will be tough for you because I can sense some animosity due to her not being good at her job.  I dont know the situation but I have always been of the opinion that first year teachers in schools like you describe should always be given a second year unless they do something just completely out of line or are just absolutely terrible which she may be.  Maybe she quits at the end or maybe she gets fired but I guarantee you she is feeling absolutely helpless at this point and is miserable going to work every day.  She knows she is doing a bad job but doesnt know how to correct it and maybe it cant be corrected by the point in the year when the kids already know what is going on.  My recommendation to you as a first year teacher would be to focus on your own class and do the best job you can do.  ,Teachers,dcfw826,31,t5_2qqcs

10386814,0,t1_dcld5j9,I dont understand to what extent a restraining order will help. I know from past history with restraining orders that often the victim ends up being the person who needs to remove themselves from the situation. That being said Ive never dealt with it within a school.There was a time I was the victim of an unsafe situation and the SCHOOL placed a restraining order on another student. This was not done through police or lawyers but was taken care of at the school level. Again the child needs to be protected but the SCHOOL should be initiating this stuff. The main reason for my recommending all of this through the school we recently went through some difficult bullying type situations in my classroom that ended in legal action. Because everything was done through the school WE were responsible for the legal aspect instead of parents. It is our responsibility generally by law to provide a safe environment for the students. If the school is not doing that then the legal action should be taken against the school. Ive also seen these situations turn into he said she said when parents decide to confront other parents directly. Ive seen some nasty exchanges off school property that could have escalated. I am going to assume that these parents arent going to just hear their child is being so beyond disrespectful and try to discipline them. Instead their child will make something up or the parents will make something up to turn their child into a victim. The OP will need the school on their side for this and will need the documentation that it has been reported on multiple occasions. ,Teachers,dclervm,1,t5_2qqcs

The program itself is great but a lot of your experience is going to depend on your mentor teachers and supervisor. If youre concerned about the cost totally understandable  fairly expensive PLUS you cant work for a year look into scholarships or loan forgiveness.

10678218,0,t3_5snbs9,Devos really cant do much herself to change the course of American education because the federal government doesnt do much education regulation anymore. It just gives federal funds to states. Devos is an empty shirt for whatever the Republicancontrolled congress decides to do with education and shes the token woman on Trumps cabinet.The US federal government spends about .B on Federal Pell Grants .B on Title  schoolsImpact Aid .B on Special Education and about B on other stuff like tech schools afterschool programs performance incentives research and administration. I suspect that special education will be fine given that President Trump has a special needs child. I dont think he really cares about public funding of special education but he does care about the bad optics that hed get for cutting it because of Barron. Tech schools and performance incentives are bipartisan so those will probably stay. Republicans will probably try to slash research programs afterschool programs Title  funding and Pell Grants. Democrats will probably pick a fight on Pell Grants because theyre the most popular and they will probably stick around. Republicans will cut everything else and theyll introduce school vouchers to fill the void. So it will be up to the states to prop up the Title  schools or allow them to collapse like Detroit. Democrats will probably happily let those schools fail so they can use them as a campaign issue in the next election.,Teachers,ddhdlg3,3,t5_2qqcs

10759133,0,t1_ddpod54,Dont worry about it Im happy to try and help. There is no need to switch programs as AR and TN have program reciprocity. It doesnt matter if youre  minutes or  miles away every state has different licensing requirements. If you look at the TN dept of ed website theyll give you the info you need. It may take some digging but that link will get you started.  If you find positions you are interested in definitely apply even if youre not licensed yet. I applied before being licensed and my school hired me on the condition I had a valid license before the school year started. You just need to sell yourself as a valuable addition to the school and show intent to license. As for subbing that is your personal choice. I subbed before getting hired and hated it for the experience. You do run the risk but I would would hope theyd want a quality teacher more. You could also try for long term sub positions if they are available. I hope this helps and good luck!,Teachers,ddpq462,1,t5_2qqcs

10831862,0,t3_5uvqoa,I teach a general ed st grade class and while I dont mind my students talking when they are working independently after instruction I can tell you that they get less quality work done when they are visiting than when they arent. I encourage them to work quietly for as long as they can. I can usually tell when my students are diligently working because the classroom is naturally quiet.  It may be that the art teacher has limited time with each class and he wants the students to get as much done as possible or he could just not tolerate student talking.  Since it isnt her classroom teacher and I am guessing it is only for  minutes a couple times of weeks it may be a learning experience for her on how to deal with authority figures.  That said I think you should talk to the teacher about your concerns.  Call and schedule a meeting that works for him let him know what you want to talk about so he can feel prepared.  Be ready to listen first and then explain you thoughts. If you arent happy with his explanation after the meeting you might what to talk to an administrator.

Its the lesson that went really well or the look of a student when they get something. I especially enjoy giving back an assignment or test to a student who workedstudied really hard for it and their grade improved because of it.At Christmas I watched the movie Elf with my class but gave them a voluntary task to do while watching. I asked them to write down the different examples of product placement they spot in the movie. Whoever wrote down the most correctly would get a prize from Canada I work in China. One of my students who always works really hard but maintains a high low  average won. She was so used to not being the top of the class that she didnt believe me when I said she was the winner and her classmates had to tell her in Mandarin. The look of pure shockjoy was amazing.Earlier this week I had my students practice their presentation skills by doing a show and tell presentation.

It does not bother me one bit. I give them a warning about a consequence that will happen if they repeat a behavior they repeat the behavior and then I give them that exact consequence. If they hate me for that thats fine. But most likely they dont actually they are just mad and dont have good coping skills.On my worst day this year a kid screamed for  minutes straight before he was finally removed from the room and then continued to act out every single time administration brought him back to my room. How did I move on? I vented to friends contacted parents and made a plan for quicker removal from my classroom the next time it happens. Now when same kid has a screaming fit I calmly walk over and pick up the phone and then keep teaching. It doesnt phase me anymore even though it really bothered me the first time it happened.

I have generalized anxiety disorder and have had major depression in the past. Teaching makes these already existing issues much worse due to the insane workload and need to be constantly on.However Ive worked really hard to improve my mental health and Im actually in a really good state right now. I have learned selfcare is key. These things have helped me maintain my mental health even in this crappy time of year. Meds and therapy  a low dose SSRI has worked wonders in conjunction with cognitive behavioral therapy. Exercise and healthy diet  Im not always good with this but Im so much better mentally when I do take care of myself physically.. Changing schools to a place where I felt more supported and which was a better environment for me personally. Not making my job my life  I try not to bring grading home though it inevitably happens a few times a semester. My time is mine.

But you need to decide whether you want to take advantage of the resources you have at the school and here on this subreddit or if you prefer to complain and wallow in misfortune.As teachers one of the skills we need is the ability to use every resource available to us to the best we can. You need to make that decision to do that or to find another school that suits you better.Id also suggest that the way you are misrepresenting your school would not be looked kindly upon if they knew. It is hardly the mess you are representing it as.,Teachers,delgjwl,3,t5_2qqcs

What is the purpose of observations?It should be a development opportunity for the teacher so you agree a focus in advance that you think you are weak on and then you do a lesson and receive feedback in order to improve your teaching.Observations by administration are a way for the school to grade your effectiveness as a teacher. They can pretend its about development all they want but its not.

11148461,0,t3_5xzlzg,He talks about things that he probably read up on eastern philosophies especially the Hindu Upanishads and adds a bunch of his own bizarre theories to it. The Upanishads talk about the oneness of consciousness. Oneness of all is Advaitha philosophy nothing new.  Except in that case there is no they reptilians etc. controlling you. You just graduate from each of these levels lives as you appreciate the connectedness of the universe and treat others as you would yourself and then attain moksha to understand the true nature of consciousness. Karma is the they. But that is not good enough so Davids added his own bit of bizzaro weirdness into the mix.For instance Saturn is Shani and it has both good and malefic effects on an individual according to ancient Hindu scriptures. They also regard the full moon as auspicious for celebrations and new moon as a day where you reflect on your deceased ancestors. Many more similarities without the bizzareness of reptilians. katho upanishad Chandogya upanishad are very good reads.

One was super meticulous and nit picked every little thing I did to the point where the recommendation letter made me sound like I was a complete disaster. When looking for a job the only people that would give me the time of day was a charter school with a sketchy reputation.

For example I had certain policies that the parents and students would read and sign that they understood.

The only real downside might depend on how comfortable with the potential that students will find out where you live or that you will encounter them outside of school.

This may not work for everybody but instead of going in swinging I decided to be myself and to really focus on building the relationships with my students. I dont do anything unprofessional or inappropriate but I talk to them like they are people not from a position of Im a professional teacher and you are the child. I tried that crap at first and really it just makes them not like you. People will say you shouldnt try to be their friend but I think to a lot of people that means never smiling or joking around with them. If they do something crazy or silly I get on their level of crazy and let them know Im not afraid to be there with them. I also am constantly talking to them instead of listening from the sidelines. Last week we were studying forces and I decided we were going to go outside and play frisbee to learn about angular momentum and lift. Instead of standing on the sidelines and watching them play ultimate frisbee I jumped in and played too. I dont think that being young has to be a disadvantage.

Anyway I basically just wrote about what type of teacher I strive to be which includes why I believe education is important how I will help students academically but also personally if they need someone to talk to and that I want students to look up to me just like I looked up to some of my teachers.Hope this helps I didnt get the grade back because my professor is super chill and lenient. He said that he doesnt give papers back but he emails people who he feels didnt do the assignment properly or at least to his standards. I wasnt one of those students who received that email so you should probably be good as long as your professor is cool.Good luck.

11497638,0,t3_642lc8,Society cant get very far without education. You need some kind of teacher. Good luck disseminating knowledge and ideas without it.The literacy rate before public education was abysmalespecially considering thats just reading and writing. Now we have the means to grow students into creative critical and reflective thinkers. The problem is we need the help of everyone else to do this...students cant only get this exposure in school they need it at home and they need community opportunities that give this as well.There are some welltodo kids that go to my school and they are intelligent. They will be a force to be reckoned with I hope. Then there are many most not so welltodo that dont get exposure to critical thinking except in school. They will be your run of the mill people.As for the perception of teachers there is nothing that has changed. This has been the perception for a long time. I remember only my great teachers and my really terrible teachers. If I wasnt a teacher I would think education sucks as well and my good teachers were just crazy should have done something else. Now I realize that it was what they were doing that they truly enjoyed and made a difference in doing.The same is true for many professions. The public has a perception that they generalize to everyone within. Lawyers doctors accountants stock brokers etc. Its only partly true but they only see the tip of the iceberg unless they actually peek andor work in it.Edit Also I want to point out that the point wasnt that you are a loser for doing it. He has respect for the job. He understands its difficult. He even jokes about the difficulties of teaching those that are just so traditionally stupid. The point hes making is that teachers are losers because from his perspective they take so much bullshit for such a thankless job. Most people would quit unless they were getting paid well.The truth is that most teachers do quit. Its becoming a serious issue in some states. Part of the problem is that you cant just pay teachers morewhere would the money come from? The issues are institutional and cultural. In most states teachers have very little if any power to change this. Honestly the whole thing should be scrapped and rebuilt from bottom to top. Unfortunately we cant do that so we have to stick it out through the rest of the bullshit that comes our way.The real issues will come sooner or later. Less people will want to teach. They will have to lower standards. That will cause issues. Either someone will fix it or itll all collapse in on itself and there will be some serious selfreflection that happens.,Teachers,dfz9994,5,t5_2qqcs

We got along great and are actually very close friends four years later but if our personalities hadnt meshed it could have been bad because she didnt really want an intern. The university I went to not sure if this is true in all areas has to send interns to schools within  miles. So if they have a particularly large class of interns they have to rely on those closeby schools which means that interneligible teachers might get stuck with interns because theres nowhere else to put them.That being said I did fill out a survey about my characterstrengthsweaknesses and so did my mentor so they do try to match people up by personality.

11508487,0,t1_dg0ga4o,I guess there are fundamentally two parts to it. First I am lucky enough that my wife obtained a wellpaying job before I quit which means I can spend the time earning the qualification I need to become a teacher without putting my family through hardship. Not everyone can do that and Im aware of how privileged I am to be able to do so in the first place. Second I looked at the twelve years I spent as a business consultanttrainer and realised that although I had cumulatively saved companies millions of dollars and made life better for stacks of bosses shareholders and sometimes employees that there wasnt a single day I could point at and say I was proud of what Id achieved. In fact sometimes the reverse was true I helped organisations to become more efficient meaning they could shed headcount. And all the work I was doing resulted in nothing more than intangible gains in madeup measures of success. I wasnt contributing to society beyond making it easier to continue the practices that have led to appalling levels of inequality. I couldnt keep doing it.

I think that will help alleviate some of your fears about talking to her.Also do not be afraid to seek help for anxiety and depression and the other issues youre going through.

Helicopter parents drive me nuts.However I became that parent two years ago when my daughter missed out on the th grade Italian award.My daughter   Studied Italian for  years. Spent  months in Italy on student exchange. Did her th grade work experience at the Italian language school in our city. Worked parttime at an Italian restaurant moving up to be the chief barista coffee maker over three years. Maintained a  average the highest in her class. Kept her head down and did her Italian homework with no fuss.The other girl   Studied Italian for  years. Never did anything outside class to improve her Italian learn about the country or immerse herself in the culture. Maintained an  average the second highest in her class. Spent a lot of time seeing the young Italian teacher after school for homework help. Was generally recognized as the Italian teachers pet.The other girl got the award.  When I rang the school the next day to enquire what the criteria were I was told that it was the other girls effort that got her the award.  When I reminded them of the effort it took for my daughter to live for  months in Italy as a  year old and to work at an Italian language school far from our house they shrugged their shoulders and said that it was the teachers choice.  When I asked who should be awarded a girl who didnt need to put in a lot of effort to get a  or a girl who needed to put in a lot of effort to get an  they said they werent going to overrule the teachers decision. My husband and I never said an unkind word to this teacher.  We showed up to every parentteacher interview and just listened to his assessments of our daughter.  We never challenged his opinion.  In fact when he gave constructive criticisms we were grateful.  We cannot have been the problem.The girls mutual friends were flabbergasted at the award ceremony. They rushed right over to my daughter with confused looks on their faces.My daughter was shattered.  She simply didnt understand what else she could have done to be recognized as Best Italian Student.So basically it was an effort award rather than an achievement award.  Except that every other subject award was based on achievement rather than effort.I can only hope the Head of Languages later sat the teacher down and made him a bit uncomfortable.The sad thing is that my daughter and the other girl were friends for many years.  When the other girl smirked while receiving the award their friendship was finito.,Teachers,dg2fmjg,-4,t5_2qqcs

11562603,0,t3_64z8yl,Are we talking elementary or secondary? Ive taught at both environments in the elementary level. Its stressful in different ways. Teaching in the urban school I was stressed because of classroom management most off all. Student behavior was outrageous. I also was often disappointed by not having supplies i needed for many lesson plans. For better worse I had lots of freedom no one ever checked on my classroom. Now at a wealthy suburban school I rarely have classroom management problems and always have materials I want. However there is a lot more pressure to be a great teacher and show parents and community impressive student work. For example as a music teacher the suburban programs are  more stressful. As far as parents go I would make negative comments or grades on about  of my  students at my urban school report cards and never heard from a parent. When I tried to contact parents they were rarely reachable. Now at the suburban school I make negative comments on about  of students and those parents usually email me.

Apologize explain how youve seen the error of your ways and thank them for putting up with you and trying to educate you when you were so resistant. Mail them to the school address with each persons clearly labeled. A phone call or a quick visit might be easier but having a physical piece of paper is so much more meaningful. I still keep a card on my desk from a student that was in a particularly difficult year thanking me for not giving up on them even when they made the class really tough. Some days I really need to look at that card and remind myself that my current students will grow up and may have those same feelings and it pushes me to be more patient and caring towards troublesome students in the moment. We get it as teachers that there are so many reasons why students might act out. A simple apology or explanation even years after the fact can go a long way. ,Teachers,dg924ut,3,t5_2qqcs

11604314,0,t1_dgbb57o,Youre right of course but no one will acknowledge that because it doesnt toe the party line.  The other issue at hand is a difference in discipline.  Also  People citing standardized test scores while simultaneously refuting their validity is the height of logical fallacy.  Seriously.  Standardized test scores tell us how homogeneous and socioeconomically welloff students are and nothing more.The fact of the matter is that most people dont retain much of what they learned in high school.  It really doesnt matter where they went to school.  I got a  on the AP calculus exam and couldnt calculate my way out of a paper bag a couple of years later.  What I did learn in high school was discipline work ethic and the basics of academics that led to bigger and better things.  I didnt graduate with a STEM degree like theyre trying to say we need to do now.  Thats not the point of high school.  The point of high school is learning social skills and discipline alongside the BASICS.  A student cannot learn those things in the chaotic environment that so many public schools now offer because boards are too afraid of litigation.  This doesnt apply to wealthier districts of course  only the majority of districts in the US.Keep in mind I went to a school where if the teacher hadnt been your moms classmate then the teacher had been your moms teacher.  We didnt fuck around.  A good private school offers a more structured and disciplined environment which in turn creates better learning outcomes which may or may not show up on a standardized test.  Evangelical schools and religious minischools that use such atrocities as A Beka Book or who hire people based on their testimony of faith are of course useless.What I find so absurd is this idea that each child its always a child for maximum emotional effect never a student should be allowed to develop his or her individuality to the detriment of all others.  Hey I dont disagree with developing individuality.  But its so much easier and less stressful if there is a scaffold in place to attach that individuality to.  You can be as individualistic as you want to be but if you cant hold down a job because youre always trying to buck the system?

11764104,0,t3_67usmf,Make the kids do most of the talking. Im coming from a high school ELA background but most of this could apply to various levels and subject areas.I use PPT and other things projected on the smartboard and I ask kids to read directions and notes aloud rather than having me do it. This works in almost all situations unless Im elaborating on notes or going off script. They can do this with handouts or directions on a whiteboardchalkboard also. One of the things Im working on which has been super helpful is making kids in my class repeat what their classmates have said whether its directions or just shareouts and discussion points. Simple like Alex what did William just tell us about this character? or Elian what are we doing right now? Excellent. Madeline what are we doing right now? Great. Dennis what are we doing right now? Not sure? Ask Maddie Maddie knows. and so on. You dont have to go around the whole room but try to hit half the class at some point each lesson it keeps them on their toes. Seriously I thought it was sort of basic but it really has made my kids more accountable they pay attention more consistently and you dont have to repeat shit all the time.Have kids work independently or in groups then have them share out what they foundwrotedecidedwhatever. You can even keep notes of the findings on the board.Get kids into an activity as quickly as possible then float around and helpredirect oneonone as the kids are working. This way youre using an indoor voice most of the time.Hold socratic seminars or other studentled discussions in which you dissolve into the background and let the kids take over the success of this will vary based on how welldesigned the activity is and how well it is matched to the abilitymaturity of students in the class. This works best with ELA and social studies but can work well for science and could even be modified for math and other areas depending on the structure and aims of the lesson.If you find yourself shouting to regain attention to come back together after a louder activity create a signal that the kids respond to. I like silly things so sometimes Ill just ask Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? Much like Roger Rabbit and shave and a haircut they are powerless  they MUST respond SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS! You can also keep it simple where you clap a pattern and the kids have to repeat it or you hold up a certain hand signal and the kids have to quiet down and hold up their hands in the same way we had quiet coyote. If you have a few stragglers or one group who isnt on board ask other students to help their neighbors out.Hopefully this helps!

11771568,0,t3_67skix,Another para here in a different role in than the other two that posted because dont we all like a little variety!.  I am a para in an upper elementary SDC class and I work in an incredibly expensive city on the west coast as well.  Similar to you I am testing the waters before investing time and money into a credential program.  Honestly I love my job. Perhaps it is my personality but being at the same school in the same class everyday is something that I really enjoy.  Additionally since my class is a combo we get to have the students for two years and watching the them grow and mature over the course of two years has been a really fun experience. I havent met any of these paras that the internet complains about.  They have to exist though because most of my interview questions centered around making sure I am not a drama llama.  All the paras at my school that I know are really kind thoughtful encouraging and pleasant people.  Most are individuals who are in the same position I am in they are thinking about getting their credential which might have something to do with it. Here is my catch to all this positivity though  I am married with two small children.  We have a dual income household and there are a lot of benefits to the position that support a healthy worklife balance which in turn make me enjoy the position even more and view it with rosy colored glasses.  If I were single and trying to make ends meet it would be a very challenging position to maintain.  Financially I dont know how I would even swing it if it were my only income. ,Teachers,dguc7j2,1,t5_2qqcs
11776182,0,t3_67zfhn,To some extent kids dont know what they want so its up to you to show them what they need even if they think they dont want it.  I would get away from bell to bell assignments as quickly as possible.  It might work for awhile but they arent going to learn and youre going to hate your job.Your are going to have to find ways to engage them in the topics which is easier said than done oh and they will probably tell you they hate it all along the way they may even say they hate you.  Dont respond with anger its the response they are seeking but dont ignore it either.  They are middle school kids and while they seem adult like a  year old has more in common with a  year old than they do an  year old. You are going to have to work incredibly hard at times with no end in sight and at times go home and cry or scream sometimes both.  They dont know you and they dont trust you and your new.  Be clear on your rules.  Have expectations and expect them to be meet.  Find ways to engage them in conversation  find out what they like and build from there.  Theres so many ways you can go.  Your an English teacher share your passion with them who do you love to read or listen to.  If you care they will care.  Play songs read poetry memorize poetry use audio tapes to read together. Have each student read one sentence then the next one reads one sentence then the next.  Show them why they want to learn.,Teachers,dguv7kz,2,t5_2qqcs

11797332,0,t1_dgx91s0,I understand. And again I think you did a service by challenging that disrespectful student. Im just saying  of interviewees wouldnt in a job interview situation  and thats a problem. Ideally they should question why a student is even there. Though that would be much more difficult.Edit To those who downvoted me  imagine the difference in the profession if applicants were visibly disturbed by this vs. acquiescent. Name me any other industry with a corollary. It simply wouldnt exist in maledominated fields like Finance or Technology.,Teachers,dgx9nk1,2,t5_2qqcs

Would it be unethical to say that the schoolposition was not a good fit for him or should he include that he was nonrenewed?,Teachers,dgxzm48,1,t5_2qqcs
11809221,0,t3_68cbuq,Something that I did in high school was selfstudy for loads of AP exams without actually taking the courses.  I could do it at my own pace and without required assignments beyond the test itself.  I could also do it yearround versus cramming in a bunch of coursework during the school year.  Im wondering if this would be a better solution for you  drop some honors courses sign up for some seminarsstudy halls and get your intellectual stimulation outside of a traditional classroom while still earning college credits at the same time.  Although I definitely would not drop AP Calc and then attempt to take the test by itself.  The AP Calc exam is a beast.,Teachers,dgym702,2,t5_2qqcs
