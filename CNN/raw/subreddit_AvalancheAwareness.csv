7230705,0,t1_d200kkz,Good feedback.  Yeah without a legend on the hazard index its hard to tell what the visualization really means.Yellow in terms of risk of triggering an avalanche is the same as red on this map.  ...That doesnt make a lot of sense now that Im writing this.  I really need to tweak the visualization.  The only thing red signifies is slide paths not that you are more likely to trigger an avalanche in that spot.When I was doing the analysis many of the fatalities occurred when the snowpack was triggered in a yellow cell.Any visible cell on the map e.g. not transparent is a potential trigger point.  Though however more orange the cell is indicates an increase in triggering risk past a point the color has more to do with the amount of snow that would travel through that cell if something was triggered and propagated which is why drainages all show up as a stark red even though many dangerous planar slopes are a large swathe of yellow.Time to think about how to communicate and visualize the risk better.,AvalancheAwareness,d202t2m,2,t5_3ayhh
