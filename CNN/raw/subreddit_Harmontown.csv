16256,0,t3_1ua04n,I loved it! Since the last episode of Harmons Community I have listened to every episode of Harmontown and was a little afraid that I would start hearing Dan in all the characters in a bad way but instead the characters all felt real and everything they said still came from them. I could tell Dan was in the episode and the story arcs but the characters werent just saying things Dan would say.In other words amazing.,Harmontown,cega9am,3,t5_2vo38

As per usual I had to pause the episode to say to my husband Isnt that funny?  Dan talked about Lava Monster.

1611428,0,t3_2crajw,Agreed. Theres a magic in the chaos that needs to be kept alive. I know Erin reads some of the stuff on here and so does Spencer and would hate for some sour opinions from some users to influence them to change how they act or what they do on the show. I would hate for them to not be comfortable being their full wonderful selves that weve grown to love listening to on the show because hodorparty thought they were being stupid or assholes or doing something wrong or whatever. Of course hodorparty has a right to say whatever he wants but there should be a consideration and a general acceptance that the show is not going to always be the perfect show for you every time. I could have a negative comment to say about every episode if I wanted to but I dont. Because its not about worshiping perfection its about embracing the beauty of their imperfection. As the great Martin Luther King Jr. once said Pobodys Nerfect.EDIT after reading some posts in the rest of this thread heres a couple more thoughts even though I do believe that it would be terrible if hodorparty negatively affected a cast member of a show and made them uncomfortable doing what comes natural on the show I understand that there are always going to be hodorpartys. There is no stopping that scenario. Also anyone whos saying ID NEVER PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO VOICE THEIR OPINIONS as a response is being a little silly. Neither would I or the OP. I believe you should consider the nature of the show before posting your negative comment. Im not saying a mod should somehow enforce that belief.,Harmontown,cjiad5a,9,t5_2vo38
1612615,0,t1_cjiad5a,The nature of the show is evolving over time. To say it doesnt have a direction is untrue. Its constantly trying to find its direction. When it fails people can say its experimental but it always seems to work best when its funny stories being told or Dan speaking with authority on something he really knows and feels strongly about.The lack of focus and the new vibe of the fans feeling they have a stake or ownership in the show can get annoying. Like when Dan or Jeff come to the stage with a halfremembered thing they read and look to the audience for guidance.Anyone out there hear about this Im confused. a sheepish hand raises from the crowd. Come to the stage! a minute of applause. I.. um heh... Im not aaan expert but this is what I heard... FUUUUUUUUCK.

1615679,0,t3_2crajw,I get it. Youre not saying dont be critical of what the show says youre saying dont be critical of what the show is right?I mean not exactly but youre acknowledging that the show is a madmans dream inhabited by people who are largely just being a heightened version of themselves that there are inherent and complex ups and downs to that and that binary this isnt delivering what I feel it promised me or this persons performance is awful arent really adequate in discussion of it.We dont have to talk about it like its a soap opera or sketch show?If Im reading you right I agree. If one of the people up on stage says something I dont agree with or that I think is wrongheaded Ill still say so but acting like theyre people who are performing a service that I paid for isnt something I feel comfortable doing.The only times Ive ever felt let down by the show have been when Ive felt the one concrete promise at the center of it  we dont bully ever  has been broken. Its only happened twice  once on tour with the guy who made the dumb comment about Erin ruining an episode and the girl who Jeff and the audience turned on and Dan despite seeming to feel compromised by it just going along with it.Even then I wasnt disappointed by the show but for me thats a superimportant touchstone in Dans character throughout all of the psychosis and selfloathing that I didnt like the absence of.Theres a fine and bendy line here though and the social internet isnt just shit at treading those its awful at discussing them. Ive just spent a few hundred words elsewhere here talking about why I think DampD feels very different now and what I think is happening to it that I still think satisfies the abovestated ideals which I mainly felt moved to write because it felt like many others were posting in a way that didnt. Thats probably just selfsatisfied bullshit and Im just a huge part of the problem myself.,Harmontown,cjitn2j,6,t5_2vo38

1835483,0,t1_ckad24s,gtDoveofDoom  Every single week it seems theres a contingent scolding people for offering anything short of fullthroated praise. Any time anybody thinks a part of the show fell short they get lectured on what makes Harmontown great and how criticism of anything will ruin it. Last week Spencer showed up to scold people about discussing Abed Gs performance. This forum has become a place where discussion is actively discouraged and opposing points of view are treated with disdain.gtthesixler  eat a dickgtDoveofDoom  Send me yours and Ill have a nice little snack Spencer. Its sad to see that this kind of childish petulant response is the best you can come up with. It pretty much serves to prove my point though so thanks for that. Have a nice day.gtthesixler  Im not going to engage with you other than to tell you to eat a dick.gtDoveofDoom  I wasnt interested in engaging with you after you told me to eat a dick so I guess were both getting what we want. Have a real nice day now Spencer.My comment at the top beginning Every single week was the only comment I had posted in the thread at the time and that is what he responded rudely to in the first place.  Eat a dick was Spencers first reply to me. We had never interacted before.,Harmontown,ckaddkp,5,t5_2vo38

But at the same time being mad at him is pretty much a waste of time we dont know each other personally i dont know everything hes been through in his life but mostly its just impossible to get mad at everyone who makes rape jokes andor misogynistic jokes. its so common that you could never like anything if you made that an automatic disqualifier. thats not to give him a pass hes responsible for his own actions including his words. but its like getting mad at a pebble in an avalanche. ,Harmontown,ckbukcw,3,t5_2vo38

I understand OPs point but ever since Ive started I loved that every episode of Harmontown is this sort of living thing. It grows it changes it doesnt have rules sometimes it falls completely flat and sometimes its a triumph. Its this highflying tightrope act that to me is fascinating both because it can be great and it can struggle for greatness.So I guess my point is that I dont mind that it shifts I dont mind that its changing. Im fascinated by it either way and I think by wanting it to be what it was contradicts what it IS.Also when someone posted at the NY show Is the crowd always that loud?

But the story is probably difficult to manage without at least a few of the majority players there and especially when the comptrollers might not be even remotely familiar with the story or characters. The episode was awesomely hilarious without DampD but Im really yearning for a return to the solid adventuring party.

Sure...especially after those things are proven to be made up like Benghazi  For instancegtexcept she practically confesses multiple sexual assaults in her bookExcept she didnt practically confess multiple sexual assaults. In fact she didnt at all.    Have you read her book? Neither have I...But Ive read the parts that everybody is freaking out over amp she was a fucking kid during all of them  And the worst of them all seems to be the fact that she GASP! masturbated as a teenager...Ill stop there with thatAnd youre completely ignoring the aspect of this story where the right is calling Dunham a liar about her books rape claims....its weird that you mentioned Cosby because somebody here posted a video of a FOX News host casting all kinds of doubt on Dunhams rape claims irrelevant BS about the usenonuse of a pseudonym for the rapist adding details that she was drunk amp on drugs and actually wanted to have sex Blaming her for the media going after a guy who seemed to fit the description in the book and then vaguely talking a bit about the child abuse BS.......and then in the same  minute video he offhandedly mentions Cosbys rape allegations but still manages to cast doubt on them due to their age  Fox News The one place where what was she wearing amp how drunk was she? are still legit questionsgtafter the resurfacing when many a right winger would defend him and still do while the left has eviscerated him in many waysAnd why did the resurfacing happen? Ill tell you Millions amp millions of people discovered that Bill Cosby has a lot of rape allegations in the preinternet past after a video of a standup comedian Hannibal Burress telling people to go home and google Bill Cosby rape went superviral...and we live in time when a youtube clip from a standup set can heavily influence the national conversation in the way that it has with Cosby  The left is merely calling attention to the newfound controversy amp explaining the context...which is that Cosby had a lot of rape allegations in the fairly recent past that were never taken seriously by anybody. The leftwing media didnt create this resurfacing of Cosbys allegations the digital age did...Not to mention the fact that youre using the word evisceration to describe reporting of Hey lots of people are talking about Cosbys multiple rape allegations. Heres all of Cosbys multiple rape allegations.It all boils down to the same common denominator The right tends to respond to womens claims of rape with skepticism...defending the accused and blaming the victim  This isnt an argument.

After a few minutes usually less than  it would be back at the beginning of the video.    Let me know if theres anything else I can do to help you solve this issue.

That must be very upsetting and frustrating to have to face giving up on something you enjoy because of something beyond your control.Some people here think the guy should be told to stop coming to shows because hes ruining other peoples experience of the podcast. But my opinion has always been that his only crime is that hes laughing at a comedy show. The producers have sat him away from the microphones theyve done everything they can to make the situation work. The guys laugh bothers a small unfortunate minority of people and personally Id be very upset if the guy was asked to stop attending the show because his presence is triggering the anxieties of a minority through no fault of his own.,Harmontown,cp6c3z3,6,t5_2vo38

3836703,1,t1_cqtayv5,Pardon the ramble as its not in pure disagreement but simply something Ive been thinking a lot about lately I dont see thousands of years as tools of violence fading when the man in the black suit with the earpiece says that violence is still necessary. Especially not when its generally discouraged for young men to go through the acceptance phase of their descent into masculinity where ideals give way to the undeniable impulses to be animals even if only in private pulsating like a glob of yeast into even deeper shame. It happens to even the most docile of us no matter how much one tries to shut it out all around you see people tapping into their inherent psychology of violence in what they see as a fight against violenceI mean how do you figure that one out?I think perhaps man as a concept is ground into amorality saddled with everything material which cant be avoided in that dirt bloodshed and temper and all those animal bits of life which breed out slower simply because of thousands of years of biological necessity. The byproducts of all that take man to the point where he can only protect or abuse woman worship or loathe often at the same time. Woman is at a point of desiring neither which was inevitable and spiritual and fuck me all the more worthy of the worship she doesnt want. If you ask me we just aint gonna impress that goddess any time soon.With every ideal comes an equal dose of fearfear of honesty and thus its a dose of repression. I mean those false constructions of self are not really false at all are they? Theyre corporeal thats sure as hell. They can be stripped sure but even that becomes false under pressure. The only way to any kind of practical mortal livable enlightenment which isnt floated about as ideological wishful thinkingor God forbid enforced as absolute thoughtfascismis through a place where we learn to appreciate the complete and total imperfection of our species both morally and amorally. Until we can do that and still manage to lovehave sex with each other I dont know that we can elevate ourselves... I think well be relying on the mercy of that spiritual woman to float down and forgive us for being animals. I think maybe theres just too much blood to shove under the rug to convince anybody otherwise.I dunno. Sorry. Long thing. Sorry.,Harmontown,cqtm8lr,1,t5_2vo38

If its a screwed up episode because of the content thats fine give it to me anyways. If its the audio quality then thats fine crap happens. But I have to wonder how bad it would have to be for it to be unfixable.

Ask ANY GamerGater about Zoe Quinn or Felicia Day theyll deny it ever happened and ask for a source. In perfect lockstep.Its deliberately circular and intellectually dishonest. These kids all know how their sad little group got started and think they can obfuscate their own history by making you tired of tracking down links containing information everybody involved in the conversation already fucking has.Telling them to kill themselves is maybe not the most mature thoughtful approach but I understand the frustration.

6273285,0,t1_cz2mlf1,If you go by numbers from  the end of Obamas first term which I suspect you are after your mention of Parwan in the comment I just responded to Yea the numbers went upIf you look at the numbers now the end of his nd term I believe theyre far below what they were under Bush. This is an issue that has changed radically just in the last  years with the release of detainees amp detention facilitiesblack sites being closed around the worldgtWhat changed is what the White House could now publicly disavow very specific kinds of abuses without actually investigating or prosecuting themIm really not sure what you mean by this but I feel like it isnt the first time youve said it amp this is the sort of thing I need to see some kind of source on to better understand. No offense but a lot of what youve said in this comment is very vague.I honestly dont know how I can be any more clear on what Ive been saying about congressional obstruction with Gitmo vs the popular criticisms about Gitmo.

6598523,0,t1_d01t72m,Sent this as a private message but I want to respond openly ltYou are misremembering the details but are referring to the podcast I recorded with Steve Greene. It bugs me that you took the time to listen to my podcast and then misquoted it but thanks for listening anyway. If things went down the way you say they did Steve wouldnt have come on the podcast and while I acted badly I never stalked him I paid him back for the iTunes bill I accidentally racked up and Im still friends with the girl he dated after me. I was also . Ill let you in on a secret he did shitty things too but its my podcast and I think its more interesting to air my own shit instead of his.  I share personal and ugly stuff about myself because when I was a teenager I really wanted to hear stories from adult women who had made mistakes because I was scared I was alone. Maybe thats because my mom died and I handled it poorly but I think most teenagers feel that way. Its true I am pretty obsessed with my mistakes and trying to be better and to love better and yes my podcast is about that. And yeah my podcast is very frequently about me so I guess Im pretty focused on myself.  Its also true that I will Talk openly about my own bad actions more than others  Maybe Im a shitty person?  But I dont think so. I think Im a good friend and a nurturing partner and theres a reason why Im still friends with my exes and why they are willing to talk with me about this stuff years later. I think you may just not enjoy listening to me which is okay.Edited for slightly better grammar and that last line,Harmontown,d01uaf7,88,t5_2vo38

Thatd be like starting a criticism of a Wiz Khalifa show by saying First I showed up to a long line of black people. Its not that the statement is racist or anything its just that people can draw whatever conclusion they want with it.

6700676,0,t1_d0c1iva,But its Harmontowns tentpole. Dan has cultivated a diehard audience from those he enables unsurprisingly and now hes beholden to it. If he reverts to just being a funny person he risks alienating his most ardent zealous fans. Its like the Republican party actually hes built his fame around catering to an unpalatable fringe and backed himself into a corner. It would be a huge risk to give that up. Edit to more directly relate to your question  Harmons ego and his audience dont see the show quality as suffering  they see an infinitely more appetizing religion growing built by the asylum. ,Harmontown,d0cep2t,3,t5_2vo38

With the exception of Ep  HARMONOLOGY I dont think Dan Harmon ever got as drunk again as he did on Ep  Nashville TN. I think those are the only times each of them ever got incoherent level drunk during a show. Its worth noting though if memory serves that Jeff Davis was that drunk before the show even started and only attended the show because Dan asked him to despite their original plans to not do a show that night or something. EDIT And this ones more of a guess but I believe Ep  Theres Nothing to Be Ashamed of Except America was Spencers drunkest episode which is a rare find since he doesnt really drink.

10422393,0,t1_dcoyz80,Thanks for the response!Some of this seems right on makes enough sense and is definitely something we should push against.But stuff like this gt She works as a coordinator five years into her career at a child care centre. She earns around the k mark. Her partner has no tertiary degree no trade but just got a job as a labourer in a steel factory and makes just over k a year.Physical labor is rewarded because that type of work is generally very physically demanding does a lot of damage to your body over time as well as potentially immediately dangerous. My brother and dad work construction and make good money. Someone died on their job site pretty recently and there have been some other worrying incidents in recent memory.I would think the fouryear double degree and five years experience would help your cousin get a higher payrate but I think the disparity between the pay of the two jobs is very understandable. Theyre different jobs with different demands.gt Women are considered naturally caringnatural mothers so teachers and nurses and the like get paid lessAgreed there teachers and nurses deserve a good bit more than they make. Not sure what the situation is down under but teachers in America are pretty grossly underpaid. Im just not sure that issue stems from a place of women do this lets pay them less. I had just as many male teachers as I had female. Budgets are hard and the people that manage them typically focus more on things more immediately beneficial. Not an excuse but Ive never thought of teachers being underpaid as a gender thing. There are loads of male teachers.gt Thats my rant. Sorry it because personal. HahaYoure good I really appreciate you taking the time to lay that out. I agree with a lot of it I think were just seeing it from different angles  which makes sense Im a man and its an issue that you see as gendered. I can see where gender could have some influence but it doesnt seem like the root of the issue to me.,Harmontown,dcpg4bw,3,t5_2vo38

10467327,0,t1_dcmsi8z,I can relate to this. I am the same age as Dan and Jeff and they each articulate things about themselves in a way that helps me better articulate things about myself. And then there is Spencer an avatar of sincerity and genuine be yourselfness. I aspire to be as fearlessly myself as Spencer is even if he would deny that he is fearless. I am a better person for being a Harmontown listener.Glad you are in a better place.,Harmontown,dcuktw3,2,t5_2vo38
10467968,0,t1_dculxso,Hillary didnt lose because shes a woman. She totally failed to address the income inequality issues sweeping the Midwest in particular. Ultimately it was one smug entitled outoftouch millionaire against another and only one recognised the need to pretend to be something else.

10724705,0,t1_ddhbi1z,I think this is a fair preelection indictment of Dans political views.  Ive always cringed at his if voting mattered it would be illegal argument because of the incredible amount of white male privilege baked into that sentiment.  Tell that to the people of color who are constantly disenfranchised of their vote.  Or people like myself  a Leftist in a Red StateRed District like Indiana  who have been gerrymandered out of our precincts  twice in  years in my case  so that our vote on essentially any position or referendum is meaningless.  That is not a call to give up on the system it is a call to demand change.  They dont suppress voting and gerrymander opposition votes because voting is so powerless. But postelection Dan has been on fire.  Both on Harmontown and on Twitter.  I think Dan is at his core a  person of great empathy.  If not consistently then at least capable of great empathy in key moments.While I am merely reading tea leaves here it appeared to me that Trump beating Hillary seemingly shook Dan out of his political ennui because of the terror a Trump Presidency means for people that Dan loves and cherishes.  I do not begrudge a sleeping man his slumber I welcome him to greet the day.,Harmontown,ddm69d5,1,t5_2vo38
