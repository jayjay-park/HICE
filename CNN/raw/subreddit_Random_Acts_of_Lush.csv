6803096,0,t3_48w2gc,I work as a mental health advocate when Im not in university so mental health is really important to me. Taking care of yourself is one of the most important things when it comes to maintaining mental wellness. This is actually the reason I got into Lush because it calms me when my obsessive compulsive disorder gets stressful and disruptive.I think doing a bath bomb based on self care would be really awesome with proceeds going to national mental health foundations like the Canadian Mental Health Foundation. It would be nice to have it both very relaxing and smelling good to help you feel good about yourself but also very nourishing because when people have many other concerns they can forget to care for their skin. Beause of this I propose a Roller Ball type bathbomb with half being a bath bomb and half as a bathmelt. It would be nice for one half the bath melt to be a dark blue with the other half the bath bomb being white with silver luster and a centre of those white soap stars so the water turns into a relaxing night sky. The Comforter scent would make sense because of the name and sweet scent that is very popular but also maybe the luxiourious scent of Charity Pot which would be my preference.,Random_Acts_of_Lush,d0nfa80,3,t5_3cpnj

Ive been having difficulties storing my bath bombs and melts because theyre so powdery and brittle but my friend keeps them in a flowerpot which I think is a genius idea.,Random_Acts_of_Lush,d0oyrop,2,t5_3cpnj

The Honey I Washed the Kids one is fairly gentle Ive heard and honey is an antiseptic so may help with certain types of scalp issues.,Random_Acts_of_Lush,d0tzxv3,1,t5_3cpnj

7088817,0,t3_4clel8,Hi and welcome! Your little guy is so cute!!! Definitely not helping my recent baby fever though haha. You are definitely in for a treat as you try all of the awesome lush products out there!My favorite products Definitely depends but right now its the Rose Bombshell bath bomb. Its a Mothers day item and was up on the UK site last month because they do Mothers day earlier than in the US so it should be in US stores soon! Its very moisturizing pink filled with rose petals and has my favorite scent.Favorite seasonal product Definitely hard to pick just one so Im just going to say that Christmas definitely is my favorite lush holiday. Theres just SO MUCH awesome stuff to try definitely something to look forward to!Favorite scent Definitely Rose Jam! Its a tough one to describe if youve never smelt it but its a rose scent with a bit of a sweet fruitycitrusy kick. Its the smell of the Rose Jam bubbleroon Ros Argan body conditioner Jason and the Argan Oil Shampoo bar and the Pearl massage bar in stores if youre interested. My second favorite is Honey I Washed the Kids which is a sweet honey smell and its has a soap shampoo bar and shower gel Its Raining Men form.Sadly I am useless when it comes to skin care recommendations. Every time I try to get into skin care I feel like this guy If you ever want to know about shower gels though Im an expert on those!,Random_Acts_of_Lush,d1jvw1x,1,t5_3cpnj

I know in working with people in general there will be times like that but its still a let down. You could always look at the missed appointment as time you now can give yourself a relaxing bath with a bubble bar or bath bomb you have in your stash. If not one of those maybe a trickle of a shower gel you have into your bath water. ,Random_Acts_of_Lush,d2eq339,2,t5_3cpnj

I live in Georgia and visit family in SC all the time and its always so humid and hot. When  feels nice and cool you know its too hot on the daily lol! Its been a long summer of checking the daily temperature and putting on shorts while gazing longingly at my comfy jackets.   I love seeing the leaves change too. And I mean who doesnt love a leaf pile??   I love the holidays in general too. The energy of Halloween and Thanksgiving and Christmas really cant be beat. Its just such a happy time!  SNOW. Im going to visit my best friend during winter and it snows where he lives and Im so excited for it! Snow is one of my favorite things.    ROASTING MARSHMALLOWS. Like sure you can make smores during summer or whatever but sitting in front of a bonfire or fireplace and just roasting an entire bag during the holidays is just way better.   My birthday! Its a few days before Halloween so Im double excited this whole month.   I love love love wrapping presents.   Last but certainly not least I could seriously go on forever! I can finally start making blankets again! I mean again I could make them during the summer but the last thing you wanna do during a hot day is have a big ol pile of yarn covering your lap!

I have a lot of chronic illnesses that I struggle with but my life is made easier by my wonderful service dog DeckerTheServiceDog on instagram you can see him watching over my bath time adventures haha. I thought that because this is the random acts of lush subreddit Id start paying it forward. Ive had some amazing lushies send me products that help me cope with my symptomsso I thought its time to give back. So Ill send the person who comments below me a lush goodie or two and if they can pay it forward to the next person who comments by sending them a lush surprise I think we could bring a lot of happiness.  Once you comment just message your address and maybe likes and dislikes so you dont get something you hate! Or you can just send your address so its a complete surprise!  Also I dont know if I did my flair right or not. Would love some help there. ,Random_Acts_of_Lush,de19o0f,4,t5_3cpnj
