1218856,0,t1_ci4zgvb,I accidentally had the auto apply drivers in the wrong place.  So it would fail out when the OS was installing.I will say how does everyone have the Auto Apply Drivers set up?  I have Install all compatible drivers and Consider drivers from all categories.  But when the task runs on a box the drivers will not install.  What i got around that issue was to Apply Driver Package to the lab of identical  machines.  I would hate to have to change this with every different lab or create a series of sequences for all our labs.And yes I would love to keep messing with this before I possibly look at UIU.,labman,ci6qmwn,1,t5_322dh
