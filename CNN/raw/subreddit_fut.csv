3052968,0,t3_2v4hty,Looks good to me! My only suggestions would be El Shaarawy or Gervinho on the left. El is a better dribbler and shooter while Gervinho is the ultimate pace master. I run with Sau and Ibarbo too and love them. Great team!,fut,coefs5n,1,t5_2swlz

9151432,0,t1_d8bxsoh,Yea its a bit of a boost i believe but not too much. If you really want the best bang for your buck wait around till after the holidays on huge packs. Specially because there will be more people paying and the prices of players will stabilize.,fut,d8c0dsd,2,t5_2swlz

9360376,0,t1_d92cf5a,I am far from the best trader in the world but normally I target a couple of reasonably expensive players say between k to k and either attempt to snipe some really low buy now prices or bid. One player I was doing this with was IF Hernandez for example. After looking at his prices I kew that I could sell any one I bought for about k if i listed the card for  hours. So I tried buy a few all under k. Managed to snipe one for k and I won a bid on one for k. I sold both for k bringing in a profit of k! Need to also take tax into consideration of course but you get the picture. ,fut,d92hua7,1,t5_2swlz
9394723,0,t3_594zko,K team? Thiago Silva is like K by himself..I would replace the CB and GK and replace them with a Calcio A center backs. They are really cheap and good. Players like Miranda amp Murillo are very cheap compared to these  and you can add Handanovic. You can also get Bonucci Barzagli Buffon.If you want to keep Silva I can imagine you do.. you can also replace Banega or Borja with one of the great Juve midfielders or Nainggolan. ,fut,d96uidp,1,t5_2swlz

10449183,0,t3_5pnn0g,Use      wide and then switch it to narrow in game for extra chem. Also how do they play at cm? In the bundesliga I cant really think of any other great players as they are all expensive such as vidal and aubameyang. I would try muller and cm ,fut,dcsicmg,2,t5_2swlz

10869735,0,t1_de13dl0,If you sell Pjanic and Khedira you have k. I wouldnt sell Nainggolan because he is so good. Parolo IF is k so once youve sold those players you only have to earn  more. IF Parolo is a much better allaround card than Pjanic because he can defend and hes way more physical and has better shooting. ,fut,de14wb5,1,t5_2swlz

11140819,0,t1_dem4dvd,Honestly I think hes the best striker under k for bpl. The only striker Id consider swapping him for is MOTM Son. Theres something about Gray that just makes him a menace to play with. ,fut,deustxd,1,t5_2swlz
