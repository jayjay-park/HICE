1722277,0,t1_cjw94o0,Okay thanks for the heads up. Im seeing some of the same stuff and was going to address it in the next post. If you want to send me the issues you found I can throw it in there or viceversa.,CFBAnalysis,cjw99nm,1,t5_2xvqe
2406645,0,t1_cm95i90,Sorry if Im not being clear Im doing this all from my phone at work. The raw total is using terms as defined above. So wins in the raw total formula is total number of wins of the P opponents youve beaten  total number of wins of the G opponents youve beaten  . for every FCS team youve beaten. Losses in the raw total formula  number of losses of the opponents youve lost to. Those categories do not consider whether those winslosses were at home or on the road. ,CFBAnalysis,cm9655x,1,t5_2xvqe
5353539,0,t1_cvvyaco,Gotcha that makes sense and youre definitely getting good results. If could make make a suggestion maybe try to use the teams Pythagorean Expectation for the season instead of their record and see what happens. The PE is more statistically significant than the raw record. Not sure how big of a difference it would make but Id be interested to see.,CFBAnalysis,cvvz437,1,t5_2xvqe
5422559,0,t1_cw4rjmn,gt d Alabama beats MTSU  gt gt Alabama .  No Change  Rating up Looks like your results are sensible enough but one thing I worry about I think its intrinsic to ELO is that winning by a very small margin against a terrible team makes your rating go up not down. One would think for example that if MTSU gives Alabama a run for its money and loses  that MTSU should rocket up in the rankings and Alabama should lose a bit. Thats probably why a team like USC  is  on Sagarins pure points ranking but hasnt cracked the top  on yours.,CFBAnalysis,cw4sef7,1,t5_2xvqe
6386718,0,t1_czfdq31,Im sorry if my comment came across as really antiPython that wasnt my intention! I was just saying that the teaching style of LPTHW is enjoyable and challenging. If youre referring to the book itself then yeah I agree that its too harsh against . Ill check out the Dive Into series. Thank you for the recommendation!,CFBAnalysis,czflq52,1,t5_2xvqe
