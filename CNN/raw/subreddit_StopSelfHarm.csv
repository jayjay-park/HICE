200830,0,t3_1w2f90,The best way to explain it away is to just act like theres a normal reason for having it. For example I have a scar on my hand from getting scratched by an iguana. I know thats what it is from and so if someone were to give me a weird look for it I probably wouldnt even notice. If they asked I would say I picked up an iguana and he scratched me. Thats that. So ignore any stares maybe your date just wants to hold your hand! and if asked you could just say you scraped it by accident on a nail as you were walking by a fence. Of course if you get close to someone its probably best to tell them the truth about your past.,StopSelfHarm,cf1bf3d,1,t5_2sigz

502955,0,t3_1ztwq1,If you dont want to stop then theres nothing to change that to be completely honest.  No amount of therapy or medicine will ever ever help if you dont actually want to help yourself.  If you dont want to stop for yourself though then consider stopping for your boyfriend.That being said times can get rough and it selfharm can seem like the best option.  Id talk to him and let him know how youre feeling.  Im sure it is difficult for him but hopefully talking to him can let him know how much you care and assure him that this isnt because of him.  If he knows how much pain your in and he loves you as much as it seems like he does hell certainly do anything he can to help.,StopSelfHarm,cfxftti,1,t5_2sigz

I just.. I dont feel loved. And he claims he loves me but he doesnt show it and actions speak louder than words... But I love him. Its a catch . Either way I get hurt. I most likely end up relapsing. And either way Im going to spiral back into the depression Ive worked so hard to escape from. Ive never completely gotten away from the depression but its been lesser.. lately.But this has really messed me up. And she said that her advice and my best bet was to talk to my mom.

1478443,0,t1_cj1kj2r,I see a therapist every week she does help me a lot but sometimes when I go see her I forget about my panic attacks or well how I feel right now. I was able to talk to a friend right now and I found out that he is going through just about exactly what I am going through. He was in a long relationship with someone and she broke up with him a few weeks ago. So I understand that he knows how I feel. I have been talking to him because I now have that feeling of not being alone. Although I do not have anyone to cuddle with right now but I am okay with a pillow for now. Although the weirdest thing is that this friend I have had a little bit of a crush on for months so it is weird that we have now sort of bonded over our pain. We have also planned to hang out once school starts again. So I am doing better now knowing that a close friend also knows what it feels like.,StopSelfHarm,cj1lkjd,1,t5_2sigz

4134721,0,t1_crrgbpi,Right now you feel this way and who knows maybe in a year youll feel differently. People dont understand self harm but they understand drinking and smoking which can equal the same thing. Its not healthy because like I said cutting is a symptom of something else going on and the act of harming while giving us a release doesnt solve the problem and in turn creates a new one which can quickly turn into an addiction. Its all a part of growing and learning. A few years ago I saw no reason to stop and now I havent harmed in over a year and while I understand its something ill want to do from time to time I have the resources to not go back. I hope one day you can find yourself at that point as well. Its a journey we all take our own way. ,StopSelfHarm,crrkv09,1,t5_2sigz

Sometimes after a while it can help or you may want to try to find a different therapist as some have different ways of doing things.

5292137,0,t3_3neozo,Its ok to feel anger. It could be that when your parents found out they didnt know how to react what to say or do and since you didnt want to talk about it they thought it be best to sweep under the rug. With your sister she might of been more verbal about her self harming and your parents might be trying to make up for what they couldnt do with you in the sense of helping. The emotions that your feeling are ok it sounds like your sister is more open about her problems and since you werent it might be coming across that shes trying to one up you it could be that whatever has gone on in the past and present that started you on the path to self harming is manifesting as anger towards your family so their actions no matter the intent behind them are coming across as how you described. As someone who dealt with anger towards my family and felt the way that you do I would strongly suggest seeing someone. A therapist or counselor will be able to help you process understand and deal with your emotions and help you heal. ,StopSelfHarm,cvo4rqc,1,t5_2sigz

6465166,0,t3_44771h,i was able to go travelling for a year shortly after overcoming the worst part of my depression i had planned that trip for years had nothing to do with depression or cutting. But this enabled me to walk around with short sleeves my scars are on the arms with the attitude if people have a problem with it fuck them and nobody knows me so who cares if it gets uncomfortable I can always go somewhere else. Of course with scars on the arms its easier than with scars on your legs because you can roll down your sleeves or put on a sweater.But what IMO you should do is go to places where people dont know you and try it out. First try it out with nobody around just to see how you feel. Than do it in situations you can escape from of you feel uncomfortable e.g. in the park not in the bus. For me it was key to know that I would never see these people again so who cares what they think. Still wasnt easy though. But maybe you are different from me and you want to do it with a friend you trust that can reassure you if things go badly. Id still say do it somewhere people dont know you.About the shame I was always fascinated by my scars so its a little different for me. But I am still sometimes ashameduncomfortable when people find out. Just keep in mind these scars are signs of you having overcome your struggles because they are scars not wounds.I hope you manage to wear shorts! Just take it slow.,StopSelfHarm,czo1k6x,3,t5_2sigz

7683691,0,t3_4kjdh4,I understand the mind set your coming from. Its not a healthy way to deal with problems that you and a partner may be having. I used to think that way at times. What it boils down to is a form of control. Cutting is about controlling something and when you do it as a way to change your partners feelings about something what your really doing is trying to manipulate them and have control over them. Its like a person drowning will cling to anything in order to save themselves even if that thing is another person who is now in turn drowning. ,StopSelfHarm,d3fl71m,6,t5_2sigz

9912096,0,t3_5h64f1,If youre going through an especially stressful intense or difficult time in your life it makes sense that youd find yourself reverting to coping mechanisms that worked in some way before. Whether its cutting drugs drinking binging sleeping a lot isolating yourself whatever. We all have things that have worked for us some of us have developed coping mechanisms that are moreless effective and moreless socially acceptable than others. Its scary when you find your adult brain reverting back to a state that you havent experienced since adolescence.I have had this happen to me over the last year following a trauma in . Im in my late s and hadnt self harmed since my teens for over a decade. But there I was doing it again. I have been struggling with it. I think when this is happening to you its time to do a serious inventory of your lifemental health and get to the bottom of whats causing the distress. Seek help if you can. If you can remind yourself of other coping strategies that have helped you to avoid self harm for a decade or two already and be proactive in positive selfcare. ,StopSelfHarm,dazki5y,1,t5_2sigz
