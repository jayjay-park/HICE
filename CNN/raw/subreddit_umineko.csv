4351900,0,t3_3ast5o,I think youre mixing it up. Bernkastel was born from Rikas despair and hopelessness after the events of Higurashi. Then in an unrelated event Lambda says that Bern was a cat that once was used as a piece by its master to step on a keyboard for an eternity until it typed the word miracle and thus corrected the logic error. Lambda does not explain how this would correct a logic error and doesnt specify that Aurora was the referred master in this particular event. To be honest Bernkastels origins as a Witch from the higher planes are very vague and sometimes contradictory. And since most references to it are by Lambdadelta I would guess that shes probably just trolling. ,umineko,csg6wsg,1,t5_2u4y3
5203857,0,t1_cvcdrk2,Im an avid reader of the Manga its pretty good. And the closest thing to the real truth is in the manga ryukishi himself said that the manga is to him is the true truth,umineko,cvd9aka,2,t5_2u4y3
5321322,0,t1_csgplnh,It wasnt directly created by him but he considers it the official ending. I havent finished the story myself but Ive heard the Manga ties up a lot of the loose ends of the story.,umineko,cvrv0g1,1,t5_2u4y3
7439844,0,t1_d2nr2wv,its actually information from the wikia considering I havent done the VN for a year I think but Yasu is now referred as Sayo but Sayo sent the bottles to confess for the sins she commited under the guise of Maria. She intended to kill the family her plan was foiled when the adults actually solved it then Kyrie and Rudolf killed her in which she somehow survived.,umineko,d2nv20d,1,t5_2u4y3
7697415,0,t1_d3h549z,The art is pretty off from the art that the ps version and the anime shows and I was in love with these.,umineko,d3h59l9,2,t5_2u4y3
9112888,0,t1_d877n0t,I mean honestly having seen the knownnomore videos I prefer his explanation and it makes more sense and is a more satisfying conclusion I kind of held to it until the manga was released but now I guess that the solution is just not a very good one,umineko,d877zup,2,t5_2u4y3
9113393,0,t1_d877zup,Im curious how it doesnt make sense the clues for the mystery were very apparent once you discover the truth. There were even some fans back in the day that called it before the official explanation was even confirmed so clearly that shows that the mystery was solvable. People who have an issue with it being a love story are as the manga declares people who cannot see with love I think the scene where goats are literally tearing apart the mystery and rejecting the answer is ryukishi commenting on those who cannot accept the truth. Ryukishi is a sappy guy who likes horror stories with an underlying theme just reading Higurashi you can see the underlying theme is Friendship and Umineko it is clearly Love.,umineko,d87a6pb,2,t5_2u4y3
9789333,0,t3_5fbmsp,In Episode  Alliance of the Golden Witch it is stated across three different red truths All five master keys were discovered each in the pocket of one of the servants! This is referring to the first twilight of Episode .The individual keys were found inside envelopes alongside the corpses!In short all keys related to the linked closed rooms were locked inside the linked closed rooms!!While it doesnt explicitly say that any nonmaster key is linked exclusively to one door in this case it rules out the existence of any other key that could open the door despite not being the specific keys to that room. ,umineko,dajqxv3,5,t5_2u4y3

10792818,0,t1_ddsl3yk,Yes but its interesting to think about. Because after Sumadera is dead there is a pause in the shooting so maybe he is hesitiating and then it cuts off. Well never know I guess another thing in Umineko you can interpret however you want.,umineko,ddt7bat,2,t5_2u4y3
