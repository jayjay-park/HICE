182823,0,t3_1w6ynm,I noticed the lack of traders yesterday after an update. It seems that if you dont have the trade upgrade yet it constantly hides the trade box even when it should be visible. Looks like it might be a bug hiding tradeContainer rather than tradeUpgradeContainer?,CivClicker,cez9dvp,2,t5_2yobq
186310,0,t3_1w7yys,I guess I should have the reset function change the displayed cost as well as the actual cost... smacks headEDIT Have added a fix for this itll be included in the next update.,CivClicker,ceznqk6,3,t5_2yobq
291277,0,t1_cfavuxq,Yeah. Im going for the Neverclick achievement now and I had to get three gold to start harvesting special resources.But there is absolutely no reason to pay for basic resources.,CivClicker,cfayeom,1,t5_2yobq

539880,0,t1_cg1n0zg,Silly question but do you have any corpses? Theyre part of the cost of the underworld altar.The d is the amount of devotion necessary to unlock that upgrade.,CivClicker,cg1n354,4,t5_2yobq

556166,0,t3_20gys2,I agree that the workers should have larger defaults like k and k just like the buildings do.,CivClicker,cg3hqpc,1,t5_2yobq
560620,0,t1_cg2rxsn,also... under upgrades tab it shows start building wonder but its grayed out is that because i already have labourers at the task?,CivClicker,cg3zyyr,1,t5_2yobq
568996,0,t3_20mo8m,As mentioned this already exists use the importexport link on the top.  Copy the code theres even a select all button for you and paste on the next computer.  Ive done this about a dozen times or so ,CivClicker,cg4y7mp,2,t5_2yobq
581633,0,t1_cg6dpey,I coded it that way because otherwise the sensible way to build wonders would just be to build food wonders over and over and I wanted players to spread out their wonder types a bit.,CivClicker,cg6dwor,4,t5_2yobq
590630,0,t1_cg7e487,Now you have to build a wonder.,CivClicker,cg7eps3,1,t5_2yobq
600725,0,t3_210mdq,Neverclick and Seven! Are all Im missing. Any pointers on how to get them? Congrats by the way.,CivClicker,cg8k0sf,2,t5_2yobq
666244,0,t1_cgfxz9w,No need to be a dick.  If you do what you said one will still be depleted first and be the one slowing the wonder down.,CivClicker,cgg01ub,-1,t5_2yobq

3823938,0,t1_cqrjnr1,Hmm...that seems odd.  Can you PM me an exported save game?,CivClicker,cqs5teb,2,t5_2yobq
4205605,0,t3_3908yq,Its been a fair amount of time but unless Im mistaken deaths in war always count as humans.  The game doesnt remember which of your soldiers are zombies or living so your population goes down in both cases.This is a good thing as far as the game mechanics go because then you can make more workers for a lower food cost.,CivClicker,crzmmph,5,t5_2yobq
