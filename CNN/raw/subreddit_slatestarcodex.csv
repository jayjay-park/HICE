5218994,0,t1_cvedgbo,The model people used was what is the probability of a nation that goes Communist working out?  So yes its a coin toss model.  Two outcomes success and fail.All the existence of a single failure proves is that failure is a nonzero probability.  Your mushroom analogy is bad because generally we think of mushrooms as either being  poisonous or  not.  If that is your only choice things would be simple indeed.Unless you seriously think that success or failure of a country is  predicted by what government type they have?  No other factors possible?  But even if you did say the probability of Communism working is zero instead of  in  million your null hypothesis is not Communism always works it is Communism doesnt always fail.Dont you get this stuff from medical statistics?  A drug being tested isnt going to be either  dead or  dead.  Often people in the test will die from other things anyway especially if they are a very sick population.  Youre testing if the drug is any better than doing nothing or giving them a placebo.  If your sample size of the test is just  people thats way too small to tell anything.I promise you the math is good I have two degrees in statistics and this is high school level math.  Of course the model could be wrong but that does seem to be the model they were implicitly using.gt Now each trial doesnt make us twice as confident that Communism causes failure it makes us about  times as confidentThat depends on your modelling.  For example are you saying each year is independent of all other years so you count each year as a separate trial?  Or are you you saying that the chance of failure of Communism in the first year is better than  where  is your estimate of how likely a typical government is to fail in its first year?  at that point sure you could more easily establish that the probability of Communism failing in the first year was more than  with a small number of trials.  Even on result would be significant.But nobody is claiming that Communism has a better than  chance of failure.  They were claiming Communism has a better than . chance of failure.  The fact is you cant make claims like that without a huge number of trials.,slatestarcodex,cvf2x97,1,t5_30m6u

5971266,0,t1_cy1ptvp,Sure you are.  As another commenter said and to which you agreedgt you are essentially proposing that since every justified belief is traceable to certain axioms and items of sense experience the validity of which is itself axiomatic we ought to be able to construct a flowchart tracing every proposition ever uttered by a human being either to sense experience or an axiom.Thats logical positivism and it is provably! false.  Suppose you build your highdimensional map of human arguments and beliefs.  It will either contain inconsistencies assert the same statement is both true and false or it will be incomplete and fail to assert true beliefs or valid arguments.  This is not a huge practical problem for most purposes  it is perfectly feasible to build a useful map of some arguments about some topics.  It is however a big philosophical problem with your project since the thing you claim to want to build is not possible to build.  Note that its not even possible to build a complete argument map of some subset of knowledge  like geology or AllegedlyImmoralstudies.  As to your other point  Suppose Im from a small ideological faction  Hindu nationalist or philosophical Taoist or Epicurian or national socialist or whatever.  Someone whos not from my faction has gone through your site and entered out of a laudable sense of fairness and open discussion what they think all the arguments my faction presents are into it.  Except theyre not very familiar with those arguments and so theyve entered them wrongly.  Not even that the arguments are invalid or that they have false conclusions but that the structure of the argument does not correspond to the one that people actually make in the real world.  What do you think is going to happen when I go in to correct them?  Seems to me like my revisions are going to be downvoted repeatedly  Im not a laudable contributor I keep making these weird arguments nobodys ever heard of and so the alternative arguments that will be presented are almost certainly not even going to be real alternative arguments.  In the real world if I want to learn about one of these alternative philosophies I can go to the sources and get the arguments there.

6197306,0,t1_cyngpgl,Not sure if I understand it but here is my try after reading other MarxBros comments but not necessarily understanding them correctlyThe value of your labour power is  which means that for  I could hire someone else to do it instead of you.The value of your labour is  which means that I can sell the thing you produced for   X where X are my other expenses such as the tools you used other people working in the company such as the salespeople or accounting etc.So why dont you buy your own tools make the stuff in your garage sell it on the market and keep the additional ? Not sure what the answer is here maybe the tools are expensive and you wouldnt get a loan or...?Maybe the reason is that the big companies have lobbied for laws that make it extra expensive for small companies a lot of regulation that creates a fixed cost so your first product would be insanely expensive any only it you make millions of pieces you are profitable. This means it is not an option for the average guy to start their own company. You need to buy a costly infrastructure to be allowed to enter the market which means that the market is only open for people who have enough wealth to pay the fixedcost entry which is possibly larger than the average worker could save during their lifetime especially if they are only paid  for producing something but then they have to buy analogical things at the shop for X.Actually the high entry cost may be artificial or natural. The natural high entry costs are already bad and the artificial ones only make it worse.If the workers could coordinate assuming they have at least some savings they could pay the entry cost together by starting their own company and then keeping  as their wages. But in real life coordination is super hard especially if you want to coordinate many people who will naturally suspect each other etc. Even after successfully starting the workerowned factory there would still be a temptation to pay other workers those not belonging to the starting group only  for the same work so if you are not lucky enough to be in the only group to successfully coordinate you still only get the money needed to reproduce.It could be said well coordination is difficult the capitalists are paid so much precisely because they solve this problem. Except thats not really a honest answer. Many things require coordination but we still have them. For example a lot of coordination is provided by the state. So its a political decision whether the state will e.g. provide the coordination necessary for workers to start workerowned companies or not. Hypothetically just like slavery was made illegal the state could make all nonworkerowned companies illegal. Note that within the workerowned company there would still be a professional management we are talking about ownership here not management  the workers would still have to obey what managers tell them except that they would have the power to collectively fire the management and hire a new one.Also this would only solve the situation within the company then on a larger scale we would have the relationships between the companies etc.,slatestarcodex,cyu2fx5,2,t5_30m6u

6218301,0,t1_cyvy7ui,Realistically speaking looking at IQdysgenic processes and the reduced need for lowskill labor indeed basically tranquilizing these populations in Pournellian Welfare Islands with subsidized junk food TV booze and maybe even borloi scifi version of pot in Pournelles books does begin to sound acceptable. However what really boils my blood is that all this is coupled with egalitarian ideology equal respect and status for all. And voting rights.I think when people become perpetual wards of the state at least the taxpayers who support them i.e. the highly skilled people should be rewarded with explicitly different status explicitly unequal respect and consideration including things like voting rights. Basically something akin to a new noble  common status Wards deferring to Taxpayers. This would be only fair.Instead we see the opposite ideology  not only that of egalitarianism but even the welfare recipients the poor are presented as victims and the highlyskilled taxpayers who keep them alive as their exploiters.  Instead of respect and gratitude to the taxpayers all they get is guilttripping. This is highly unfair. Nobody actually wants to exploit the underclass anymore even if  IF  Marxists concepts were somewhat right  years ago they are not right anymore the lowIQ masses are no longer seen as a reserve army of labor because employers want quality labor now nobody really needs their labor anymore so there is no exploitation going on.

Ill attempt to do what you were trying to do better. some people didnt smart good. Then they read a book. Now they are butthurt. Lol.Thats a similarly accurate summary of the information being conveyed. And its still accurate in my mind to say that picking a bad paragraph out of an academic book is not an example of bad writing. Its an example of bad editorialization. And my point was bad writing is common in academia because we read the texts for the information they contain not for how its presented. Ergo Scott does not need to give advice to other writers because his writing is already good enough to do what he wants it to do. And I like reading it. So examples of much denser richer writing about more interesting subjects by credentialed academics do not prove a point that you may want to prove. But nah. Ask me why I wont fight you IRL.

6804965,0,t1_d0nfl8f,Characterizing authoritarians as having a desire for order makes sense but Im not sure how a fear of outsiders comes into this. As far as I can see thats just something they decided to throw in.And I think that theyve got some blinders on with regard to this aspect that really damages their point. They devote a lot of discussion to Conservative fear of minorities. But they choose only to consider that in a racial or nationalistic sense. I claim that youll see Progressives doing their best to stave off minorities and outsiders except they define outsideness in different dimensions. Consider stock argument concerning income inequality the  trying to be fairly treated by the  or over climate change dont listen to that lunatic fringe the majority of climatologists all agree.And doesnt this go directly to the Progressive economic program? Theyre fearful of change  i.e. the lack of security in our jobs etc. So they seek to preserve order by enlarging the financial safety net and looking for other areas where people might be insecure in their economic outlook.This should be pretty obvious to anyone whos tried the libertarian smallest political quiz. The diamond shape that the results are plotted on has four extremes at the left and right poles are Progressive and Conservative. But at the top and bottom are libertarian and authoritarian. These middle two are both equidistant from both of those leftright extremes.It seems to me that Progressives can be every bit as authoritarian as can Conservatives.

6923538,0,t1_d10x6yb,Ive also got an economics degree and I also get annoyed about trade talk but in the opposite way.Firms could certainly engage in predatory pricing if there are high barriers to entry. But there are many ways of solving this problem and its not at all clear that tariffs are the best way to do it. It is only clear that they are the most politically favored way to do it.Here are the steps that any reasonably described problem should be responded to from a policy perspective. Analyze the situation. Make sure what is claimed to be happening is actually happening. In this case it might just be some proof that China is subsidizing the export of tires.. Show that the situation is bad. Is tire making some strategic industry that we desperately need to preserve? Would it matter if we lose all the tire making jobs? Yes there will be some short term pain in that industry but there is also a small benefit of cheaper tires spread out among the entire US economy.. Craft minimum impact policy solution to target the problems. In this case if we are worried about China using predatory pricing then we could just short circuit their long term game by saying if prices for tires rise above x level we will provide loans and subsidies to US tire companies for ten years provided from the increased tariffs on Chinese tires. China will have its own public choice concerns and some of those concerns might be causing it to just rather stupidly subsidize tire making rather than playing at a longterm predatory pricing scheme. We should have a policy that allows us to take advantage of the policy mistakes of other nations and respond appropriately if its an attempt at screwing us over.Out of curiosity did you take many public choice economics classes in your degree?

7653831,1,t1_d3byarr,gt ... she felt like she may be in danger because a man was propositioning hergt ... it happened in an elevator which should obviously be offlimits for propositioninggt The fact is Im oblivious. There are probably hundreds of perfectly reasonable rules about asking women out and I could be missing any of them.gt Even if I study appropriate askingout procedure from now until doomsday theres always the chance I missed the one relevant featuregt  in lieu of an official comprehensive list of where is and is not an acceptable place to proposition someone this reduces to the same thing.There is a disingenuous shifting of context here which Id like to address. No matter how many spiders are on your face you are in no real danger. You may feel like youre in danger. Im itchy and nervous just thinking about it. But whether youre freaking out or calm about it nothing bad will happen. Its an irrational fear which is why its called a phobia.Fear of sexual assault is not a phobia because its not irrational. It happens all the time. It happens exactly in situations like Elevatorgate. Creepiness is a warning sign of sexual assault. It is not that a man is being creepy. It is that he was being creepy in a situation where the woman had no source of escape no witnesses and probably no reasonable chance at defense were he to sexually assault her. There are not hundreds of rules about asking women out. There is only one rule. It is the only rule that matters. DO NOT BE THREATENING.You could walk up to a woman in broad daylight in the middle of a crowded mall and proposition her ever so politely for all manner of sexual perversions. Is it inappropriate and gross and annoying and everything else in the long list of feminist complaints about harassing males? Absolutely. But youre not threatening. You have broken the rules of good taste but not the rule of threat.You could follow a lone woman into an elevator at am for no purpose other than to ask her innocently to coffee. You could be the smoothest motherfucker suave and handsome and you have still failed because you did not follow the rule of threat. She might have said yes in any other context but if the possibility exists that her no will be contested insulted or at worst ignored she will be onedge and defensive from the get go. Nothing you say will matter.The problem to your point is that there is no comprehensive list. But it is never about where you proposition someone. It is always about how. There is no list of things not to say because somewhere there is a woman who will say Of course I love your personal perversion! or at least they like you enough to suffer through it for your happiness. But the key is consent and trust. You must project an aura of trustworthiness and it has to be compatible with their experience.This is where the I dont understand and there are no rules! arguments break down. Many supposedly rational people fail to understand the perspective of the other player in the game. To paraphrase Margaret Atwood Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.. It is a game with disproportionately horrific consequences for a womans failure to pay attention to creepy signals. A false positive is bad. A false negative leads to rape or murder.This is where I get annoyed.gt its something you dont understand and probably would never think about unless someone tells you. Even a cursory study of womens history of any phase of feminism repeats this message over and over. Its derogatory and dismissive to insinuate a selfadmittedly irrational fear of being rejected is in comparable to a fully justified fear of being sexually molested assaulted or murdered. This is not hard to understand. It is not a secret. Every feminist is shouting it from the rooftops. If you are to make any sort of criticism of feminism at all but say no one is telling me how to not be creepy! or I dont understand what the rules are? you are flat out ignoring something that  of the population has been saying for decades. To loop back around and put it in the context of the Meditations something about women makes them irresistibly delicious  and allergic  to tarantulas.  in  women worldwide are bitten by tarantulas at some point in their lives. Many end up in the hospital some die. Women have a shared culture of being afraid of tarantulas most have a tarantula story or a history of being traumatized by an encounter with a tarantula  often when they were small children. Tarantulas can be carefully trained or defanged but one cant simply tell through casual inspection. Men are largely unaffected. Yet men are also clueless about why women are afraid of tarantulas and reject their insistent and continual demands to play with these tarantulas in any imaginable situation  often when there is no possibility of medical attention in the case of a fatal tarantula bite. Or in the case of a severe allergic reaction to an unwanted brush with a tarantula doctors insist the problem stems from some other source. Perhaps you encountered a wild tarantula?  Well you shouldnt have played with that mans tarantula if you werent sure it wouldnt bite you.  Did you provoke the tarantula in some way?  Why werent you wearing protective tarantula gear?  Dont you know tarantulas love to hang out in dark alleys? am in an elevator Hey want to come back to my room and play with my tarantula? Hes right here in my pocket. Walking through dark alleyway Check out my tarantula! Hes harmless wont bite you I promise. Stranger in the park Wait up! I just want to see if you want to let my tarantula crawl around on your face for a while!Repeat ad nauseum a million times. Its disheartening that after three Meditations Scott got so close to the heart of the problem with his excellent parallell of Ganj and the Indian beggars making him feel threatened. But unlike the woman in the elevator Scott was free to leave India. Women cant leave. They are a white rich tourist trapped in India forever. That is privilege. Being able to leave India.

Yet they refused to run a story about over a hundred British economists writing a letter to the Times saying that Brexit would be a disaster. Staggering incompetence or something weirder at play? I think the latter. The BBC is ideologically committed to supporting austerity until the government stops supporting it  which it just has  for fear of having its funding cut. This ideology has meant it has largely disdained and ignored experts in economics  economists  since about . But this is a subtly different analysis from the one presented by Noam Chomsky et al in which mainstream media always act in the interests of elites. Yes elites were split on Brexit but outside of the rightwing press and the hedge funds the vast majority of the elites supported Remain but even the BBC didnt do a very good job of showing the people what the real consequences of Brexit would be.Another puzzler in Britain is immigration. The actual mainstream view is clearly that immigration is too high and needs to be better controlled. Yet Labour politicians were surprised to discover that these were peoples views when canvassing against Brexit and still even now say things that sound suspiciously like immigration is an unqualified good. Not that they cant try to make that case of course but as usual they dont seem to engage with most of the arguments of the people who are against high immigration.

8546872,0,t3_4wqvp4,gtThe Daily Beast How Paul Krugman made Donald Trump possible. Summary by crying wolf so long and hard at moderates like Romney Trumps real dangers are downplayed in comparison.Im not gonna argue that some liberal commentators arent unduly harsh on GOP candidates but blaming that for Trump and Paul Krugmans criticism of Romney in particular is bizarre.Heres a link to the posts Krugman made about Romney on his blog in . I cant link to his NYTimes columns but if you go here and search for romney youll get a list of them. Id love it if someone could point out which ones were so goshdarn beyond the pale they deserve partial blame for Trump.Romney was a much better candidate than Trump and IMHO would probably have made an adequate president but he lied constantly throughout his campaign often on economic issues  to a degree that was really quite astonishing. Krugman is an economist who writes columns and blogs about economics and politics  its not unreasonable for him to get worked up over a presidential candidate who lies about economics. Should he have cut Romney a break just in case in four years time the GOP ran someone worse? Also Trump is the nominee because primary voters chose him. Does anyone seriously think those republican primary voters were reading Paul Krugman? Does anyone think they would have been dissuaded from voting for Trump if four years earlier Krugman and other liberal pundits had gone easier on Romney? Ive seen Ozy make a similar argument on her bloggtAs best as I can tell the major argument people provide about why I a dove who strongly opposes the drug war should vote for Clinton is that Trump is even worse. While I might want to vote my conscience in general in this case the consequences of Trump becoming president are so awful that I have to hold my nose and vote for Clinton. This argument would admittedly be a lot more plausible if Democrats were not The Boy Who Cried Hitler. While I agree with the claim that Trump is exceptionally bad I am suspicious when this claim is also trotted out about McCain Romney and other establishment Republicans who have more qualifications for office than being the star of a bad reality TV show and who could be trusted to leave the country not substantially worse than how they found it.And I find it similarly unconvincing  Some people said Romney or McCain were especially terrible candidates when they probably werent therefore I should ignore a much larger group of people including many independents and Republicans telling me that Trump is an especially terrible candidate.  Its a version of Scotts weak man argument Youll always be able to find SOMEBODY online who thinks any given candidate is worse than Hitler that doesnt mean you get to ignore credible evidence that theyre terrible.,slatestarcodex,d69xi9r,25,t5_30m6u

Some of these rare mutations are recessive so parents could simply choose to edit in  but not  copies or use sequencing to ensure only embryos with  copy are selected. Then the children when they grow up simply have to make sure they use IVF as well or marry a noncarrier. Torsion dystonia itself is dominant but only partially penetrative so there must be other genesenvironment moderating the effect of the mutation and you could imagine selectingediting those in as well. Still quite a risk. But its moot because for the most part we have no idea about any of the rare variants which might be driving Ashkenazi intelligence. As far as I know the Ashkenazi intelligence hypothesis remains a hypothesis no ones done big GWASes in them using whole genomes no ones demonstrated smaller GCTA estimates for intelligence in Ashkenazi indicating that more of the heritability is being driven by rare variants not seen by a GCTA etc. If you wanted to engineer an embryo to be Ashkenazilike intelligent you cant.In contrast  and  seem to be free lunches in making one healthier and smarter  and  are also the ones which can be implemented right now with PGD.

The argument is that the world was simply safer both in the West and outside it there were more places where you could walk during the night without becoming mugged. Obviously progressives wont agree with it claiming things like racism subjugation of women etc. was worse. The argument is strongly centered around safety for example that violent crime increased in the UK between  and  by . And lets not even talk about how safe was Cairo or Congo when it was a colony and now.This is based on the Maslow pyramid. Even if one concedes that progressive changes were in some cases positive e.g. even if one concedes that the march of feminism actually helped women a big if really women dont seem that much happier that is somewhere around the top of the pyramid selfactualization i.e. something for the elite. Nevertheless women are the primary victims of the low of the pyramid getting worse violent crime lack of safety.Similarly the argument is that if we had modern governance with the tech of  the world would be an obvious hellhole. With lower productivity welfare obligatons would absolutely break the budget. With lower productivity the cost of modern regulations would be impossible to pay for. With lower forensic tech crime would be unstoppable. Hence the argument is that the world is worse governed not worse.,slatestarcodex,d6x8g81,12,t5_30m6u

Apparently cognitive deficits from chronic abuse vary with substance  Also drugs generally cause longterm potentiation LTP but ethanol and THC also cause longterm depression LTD of synaptic efficiency though I dont know the distinction.gt The metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde and then to acetate is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species that accentuate the oxidative state of cells.

The geological variation is there and more or less the borders follow them. Examples are the Jordan river and the Zagros mountains. Additionally it wasnt up to Europeans to be so noble and execute this great idea of dividing the region into smaller countries. For example the US has invaded Iraq without international support and uses drone strikes wherever it may please them but that doesnt mean we should go in and split the US into its states. Thats up the American people. Further you are using the word rebel which is rather awkward since it is their own country and the British were far away from home. Even more problematic is to think of religious denominations as tribes. I think splicing up Greater Syria so that different new countries would have a minority actually be a majority is a clear example of Europeans not having the best interest of the region in mind just as supporting dictators from minorities.

Nor do I treat lightly the various signals he has given of indifference to or at least ignorance of the U.S. Constitution. My point is that these demerits do not by themselves qualify Trump for comparison with Mussolini much less with Hitler.gtRather I want to argue that Trump has much more in common with the demagogues of the earlier lesser depression of the late nineteenth century and that it is to that period that we should look for historical analogies and insights.gtThe best illustration of my case is the now forgotten figure of Denis Kearney leader of the Workingmens Party of California and the author of the slogan The Chinese Must Go!

9833865,0,t1_dapafpd,At some point I think Ive read every article EY ever posted on LessWrong. It took a while I went mostly in chronological orderMy overall feeling is Specific atoms dont matter and arent worth trying to tie an identity to.  That a simulateduploadedwhatever computer instance of my personality would assuming sufficient fidelity and with the same causal links to my current mental state as my hypothetical future meatself be a valid incarnation of me That consciousness is not a magic fluid that needs to be carefully and gradually poured into a new vessel. QM tells us that if all the atoms end up in the same places at the end on a fundamental level youre in the exact same universe. So the result is the same whether you do a gradual shipoftheseus style replacement of brain bits with computer bits or a single wholesale swap. That therefore physics permits there to be multiple future instances of me all of whom would become distinct individuals from each other at the point of divergence but could all correctly claim that I am their past self that they remember being me and represent one among many possible continuations of my personality. That when the meatpuppet version of me ceases to function that is still me dying even if that happened as part of the upload process. At least its the death of one of me. The meat me. Which is unfortunately the specific one of the many possible mes that I am. That having a computerme persist into the future is preferable over having no version of myself persist at all. But even more preferable would be a no me left behind approach where I achieve immortality though never dying.My lack of belief in any magic fluid of consciousness means that I dont see any way for this particular one of me to escape out of his doomed meat shell. I cant be precisely numerically the same entity as that hypothetical computer mind because I am not made of computer  Im made of meat.Essentially I think Im looking at consciousness the same way I look at digestion  I can imagine substituting my stomach with a mechanical replacement and it doing a wonderful job but it would seem absurd and illdefined to ask whether its The same digestion transferred to a new substrate. That digestion was inexorably tied to my current stomach it cant be transferred into a new one because theres no thing to transfer except a fuzzy ambiguous humanapplied label which doesnt really exist except as a convenient shorthand.And thats how I feel about the idea of my consciousness  Im not sure whether to say its not a thing at all that persistent identities through time are a complete illusion and Im a different person than the person I remember being yesterday because Ive been unconscious since then or that its one of those abstract label type things like game or blegg or France but in either case Im left with a sinking sensation that its not the category of thing that can be scraped out of my skull and injected into a new home.,slatestarcodex,dapdi6y,6,t5_30m6u

9875763,0,t1_datonea,As someone who works in the entertainment industry I feel like they are in the right here. I can even see direct parallels with this and the fan recreated original version Star Wars trilogy bootlegs for those who dislike George Lucas special edition edits or who want to see the original Star Wars trilogy in its original historical context. George Lucas and Disney can sell Star Wars bluray discs of whatever version they want consumers arent forced to buy them if they dont like the special edition. At the same time once a bootlegger fan has legally purchased a bluray it seems acceptable for them to rip the files in order to Frankenstein monster together an original version. In fact all Star Wars bootleggers insist that you purchase a legal copy of the bluray of each movie you watch in order to be legal in watching the bootleg rather than pirating the movie just because you dont like the version on the market.But this also brings up some important questions as to what exactly is right for people to filter as offensive before the artistic integrity of a work is compromised. VidAngel uses alcohol sex violence and swearing as their primary examples but I can imagine a day where more ambiguous content like mentions of Evolution women talking out of turn or nonReligion character are filtered out. I guess when it comes to peoples private choices at home you just have to accept that theyre going to do what theyre going to do and hope that they understand that theyre making a compromise to the overall content for the sake of their own comfort. I feel like I can trust peoples intelligence to not try to watch a racy movie if they see on VidAngels website that there will be  scenes cut out making the whole thing incoherent. The chance of someone watching Irrversible on VidAngel seems slim. I feel like its more likely that people would use VidAngel to edit out little things from mainstream popular movies than bowdlerize arthouse films. I could be wrong who knows.And on the flip side I think it may add to the cultural discourse if viewers who would be too squeamish to watch a certain movie are now given the chance to engage with it. For example maybe people who are mildly homophobic might become more empathetic after watching a movie with LGBT characters but would only do so if any explicit gay scenes are filtered. Maybe this experience would build up their tolerance not to the point where they can watch gay sex without flinching but perhaps to where two gay characters can kiss and the viewer wouldnt turn off the movie in a kneejerk response. I feel like giving users more choice might lead to certain beneficial outcomes like that.Basically Im fine with homefiltering as long as a few criteria are met. The original content creator is paid. Already the case.. The content is not edited and redistributed but rather optionally filtered leaving the full version just as available. Already the case.. The filtering service makes it very clear that filtering is going on. Duh.. The filtering service gives the user choices of what to filter they dont give users prefiltered content based on what the company thinks is offensive or not. Yep.. The users are given a summary of what is being filtered perhaps giving them an idea of how the story would be impacted in order to inform their decision. As a content creator I want people who filter to at least understand what theyre compromising so as to understand that its a twoway street of comfort vs artistic integrity. Unclear if VidAngel gives summaries.. This doesnt spread to ambiguous PublicPrivate settings such as church groups Boy Scout troops etc. When you have a captive audience who is essentially forced to watch a film at Sunday School how can you figure out what filters to use that  of the audience agrees with? When its no longer a direct parent who is making the filtering decisions is that right for the child? But perhaps filtering for a large social group could increase the educational potential of otherwise racyuncomfortable films for groups like this. Ultimately the protection here is that it is somewhat illegal to show films to large groups like this without getting permission and paying a licensing fee. I recall that even in college the residence halls couldnt officially announce movie nights in the lounge for this reason. I guess youd just have to trust that VidAngel makes it clear that their service is strictly for home filtering to protect their own ass.. Filtering doesnt become standard in educational settings. Anyone remember having to take home a Were going to watch an Rrated movie in class are you okay with that? permission slip to your parents before watching Schindlers List in high school history class? I really hope conservative teachers or parents dont try to circumvent this by just prefiltering the movie. But I trust the intelligence of teachers and I suspect that educational licenses for movies are different as well. The same goes for colleges where students are voluntarily studying and so professors dont need to ask their permission to expose them to uncomfortable content despite the spread of Trigger Warnings. Again I suspect VidAngel wants to protect themselves here and only allow home filtering.So its an interesting subject for me as a content creator. I think as long as the original product is not being permanently changed and disseminated users are informed of exactly what is being filtered and the filtering stays in private home settings I am fine with it. You just have to trust people to make intelligent decisions but at the end of the day if people pay you money for something they should be able to remix it however they want privately. My only concern is that Hollywood doesnt try to scoop the trend and start offering Edited Version movies. I suspect the artists would revolt and require something in their contracts to avoid this.,slatestarcodex,dauu2gm,10,t5_30m6u

This is perhaps the most blatant example of constitutional hardball I have yet seen.  So what are the ramifications if the norm of being a faithful elector gets fully eroded? Perhaps state legislatures will pass laws that provide harsh penalties for being a faithless elector.  That seems like a reasonable compromise you can only be faithless if youre willing to endure some harsh penalties. Perhaps the political primary process will effectively become meaningless and people will resign themselves to voting for an elector from a particular party instead of a candidate in the general election. Perhaps political parties will work to infiltrate one another with operatives whose job it is to act as a faithless elector to benefit their team. Perhaps this will only be used in situations like the Trump situation where theres a candidate whos hated by many in their own party.

This claim was repeated in the first paragraph of the article Julian Assange the founder of WikiLeaks has offered guarded praise of Donald Trump. gtThe second claim was an even worse assault on basic journalism. Jacobs set up this claim by asserting that Assange long had a close relationship with the Putin regime. The only evidence offered for this extraordinary claim was that Assange in  conducted eight interviews that were broadcast on RT. With the claimed AssangePutin alliance implanted Jacobs then wrote In his interview with la Repubblica Assange said there was no need for WikiLeaks to undertake a whistleblowing role in Russia because of the open and competitive debate he claimed exists there.gtThe reason these two claims are so significant so certain to attract massive numbers of clicks and shares is obvious. They play directly into the biases of Clinton supporters and flatter their central narrative about the election that Clinton lost because the Kremlin used its agents such as Assange to boost Trump and sink Clinton.

The locals didnt shy away from telling you exactly what they thought about things.One evening a couple soldiers came by the house.  One demanded that the teachers myself and two European women surrender our passports.  They wouldnt accept copies but if we wanted theyd put us up in a hotel near their station for the night an offer we declined as politely as possible.  While one of the soldiers looked through our documents and spoke with our host the other was playing Candy Crush on his iPhone.  They asked our host to relay their compliments to the very pretty Europeans and left with our papers which were returned undamaged two days later.On a conscious level I understood that they could really ruin my day but I never got the impression they were interested in doing so beyond the limits of their job description.

What happens when laws get put into place to disincentivize certain behavior by imposing a tax or fine on it. It seems for instance in the traffic tickets case that the city does not honestly want to disincentivize the behavior but has the laws in place because of revenue reasons. Isnt this an issue with way more taxesfineslaws? Take for instance the sugartax what would happen if this is put in the budget as an income based on previous consumption patterns and then the disincentive works so well the expected revenue drops significantly from what was expected.

They completely ignore that determinism can be used by the other party as well I no longer want justice when I want to punish criminals I am simply determined to desire revenge. I no longer think the poor deserve to be poor I am simply determined to be selfish and not want to share.

How do you even give a precise technical definition of what it means for an AI to be safe?The idea that an AI could correctly capture human ethics seems hopelessly optimistic. There is no such thing as human ethics. Humans disagree with each other about ethics. Im not sure what to make of the papers that have been written on AI safety though I have to confess that I havent spent the time necessary to really understand them. Some of them I have trouble connecting to a concrete path to AI construction. Others explore potential pitfalls that lead to AI destroying the world and study how we might try to avoid them. Scotts report from the conference is along these lines. Thats all fine for now but whats the endgame? Lets say youve come up with a bunch of sanity checks and you have a method to create an AI that passes all of them.  What then? Do you release that AI into the wild? What happens if the AI destroys the world in a way that you failed to anticipate or for a reason you didnt think of? My first impulse is that the only logical approach is to be a Luddite. If AI is dangerous  so dangerous that we cant predict what it will do  then we should regulate CS research so that no superintelligent AI is ever built. That doesnt mean doing anything right now but as we get close to a superintelligence something will need to be done. ,slatestarcodex,ddfjmdb,2,t5_30m6u

The lib dems picked up a big number of votes that basically didnt do them any good because of the first past the post system at the height of their popularity so they might be reconstituting a vote while still being at relatively low numbers. That there hasnt been a rise after brexit would seem to suggest no though Edit they are up to  in the latest polls but the tories are at  and due a landslide even if lib dems eat into their current majority. I read a lib dem election post mortem analysing polling numbers and their disaster. It basically said that they were decimated in the last election not because of a rise in the tory vote but  because their vote in their heartland seats in the south of england was made up of people who didnt like the tories for one reason or another anti establishment would vote labour but live in a libdemtory marginal just hate the tories and a few others. Their tory alliance collapsed this and they got soaked. They did pick up votes from tory and anyone but labour voters in mainly northern lablib seats but this wasnt enough to account for their losses.

Are you sure we arent just seeing few LabourgtTory moves because Labour is in fact currently for Leave and close to the Tories on most issues?I think that the tories did gain a substantial number of crucial votes from labour at the election before last according to this they didnt gain many at the last election though.

We have at most a year to defend American democracy perhaps lessgtSZ When Bannon calls the press the main opposition party that should make everyone concerned. This is not only intended to cheer up Trump supporters.gtSnyder When you say that the press is the opposition than you are advocating a regime change in the United States. When I am a Republican and say the Democrats are the opposition we talk about our system. If I say the government is one party and the press is the opposition then I talk about an authoritarian state. This is regime change.gtSZ Last week Trump called those who take part in demonstrations thugs and paid protestors. This doesnt show respect for First Amendment right it sounds more like Putin.gtSnyder That is exactly what the Russian leadership does. The idea is to marginalize the people who actually represent the core values of the Republic. The point is to bring down the Republic. You can disagree with them. but once you say they have no right to protest or start lying about them you are in effect saying We want a regime where this is not possible anymore.  When the president says that it means that the executive branch is engaged in regime change towards an authoritarian regime without the rule of law. You are getting people used to this transition you are inviting them into the process by asking them to have contempt for their fellow citizens who are defending the Republic. You are also seducing people into a world of permanent internet lying and way from their own experiences with other people. Getting out to protest this is something real and I would say something patriotic. Part of the new authoritarianism is to get people to prefer fiction and inaction to reality and action.

With the advent of the internet this opinion went from niche to widespread popular and persuasive.Traditional sportswriters started losing credibility to upstart bloggers and the establishment writers pretty much went crazy. The really interesting thing is that the establishment didnt just react by saying that the new statoriented generation was wrong  a lot establishment writers loudly and insistently said that the new generation was EVIL. So youd get a lot of articles about how these statheads were killing the soul of the game or trying to reduce humans to numbers in spreadsheets or promoting a belief that players were basically replaceable robots.You can see the echoes of that in contemporary culture writing where people who dont have the facts on their side routinely denounce others as evil. But the really really interesting thing about all this is that most every sportswriter Ive followed since that time has ended up  taking the side of the establishment culture media over the internet upstarts.

The neighbors come to complain they fight and the parents of both families die.Now I have two cows and the kid next door has zero cows. Surely I should return the cow?Suppose I dont return the cow.  years later I die and I pass on  cows to the next generation having sold the surplus milk from the stolen cow at a profit compounding as I used the proceeds to buy more cows.

Percent reaching a given age is a broad cumulative measure of allcause mortality.  Note that I also mentioned differences in drug addiction a much younger killer and rates of injuriesaccidents.gtThe survival gradient doesnt offset it and we know this because the population polygenic scores are decreasing in both crosssectional HRS Biobank samples and longitudinal Iceland population data series. If increased mortality were adequate purifying selection the PGSes would not be decreasing but they are. The dysgenics is real.I am skeptical of these indirect correlative measures when they havent been validated by rigorous physiological understanding of the roles of the genes.  A gene associated with educational attainment over the past  years may have nothing to do with intelligence directly but instead buffer against environmental perturbations to brain development such as low nutrition which are no longer relevant in that society.  Throwing data into a giant pot and going fishing for significance is preliminary analysis at best no matter how much fancy statistics you do any effect without a known mechanism should be regarded tentatively at best.As for the number of kids and grandkids being consistent that data is interesting but its also from a single technologically advanced society with universal healthcare and a strong welfare state.  Does that hold true in the US?  Mexico?  Somalia?Sorry I havent seen anything that makes me thing that a  point IQ drop would mean the world is ending.

11186318,0,t1_dezqi5t,Question is my vague feeling that somehow the left the liberal the elite narrative and the mainstream media somehow amalgamated into one lukewarm ideological porridge somehow correct? And is the hard left just as frustrated by this as the right? Paging ueaturbrainz here...I mean the chronology is likely that the traditional base of the left white poor  working people kind of disappeared or got less important and thus different kind of oppression not class based stuff like antiracism and feminism got more focus and this got really mixed with liberalism into a generic progressive outlook and then the elite and the mainstream media picked it up too but in a watered down way so mainstream media feminism is mostly just picking random succesful women and celebrating them which really does not help most women. And somehow they all suspiciously look like being succesful in a way that is making capitalists rich haha.  And similarly elitizedmainstreamized antiracism is all about presenting people of color as people who under their skin behave exactly like rich white educated people which is ridiculous.So my point is this mainstreamified lukewarm idelogical porridge does not really help anyone anymore but it can still piss off some guys and that is how you get the AltRight.I mean I for example am not Alt Right but you see I tend to like historical mags BBC History and Spiegel History and all that and I am getting fed up by them. That instead of history I get a lukewarm progressive idelogical porridge. Maria Theresia the strong empowered woman gays in th century France slave trade even more slave trade some more slave trade nonwhites traded slaves all over but still whites should feel bad about it why  Turkey needs to be more liberal in the English Civil War it was totally the king who was an asshole Iceland was a cool place without a king the British Raj sucked that sort of stuff.I mean I am not inherently opposed to these narratives but it feels like a constant onslaught of one simplistic oppressoroppressed narrative without any alternative and different viewpoints or just basic simple nonideological history.It just annoying that every single history mag and article has to give the exact same ideological bent and I suppose when you get really pissed off by it that is when you move far right.I could totally easily imagine hard left people are just as annoyed by this. Because you see all these articles go on a very narrow path veering off neither left or right they want to come across as progressive as antioppression proemancipation but not actually going any radical or rocking the boat mostly just making a bourgeois reader feel good about himself that he is now a nicer guy than the bourgeois people a few generations or centuries ago. It is clearly fluff and I would probably rather deal with real radicals and real reactionaries than a lukewarm approach that uses a vaguely leftish direction as a status symbol but is fundamentally superficial.

The micro field is pretty well understood scientifically today has as far as Im aware fairly broad agreement among the experts and the concepts arent too difficult to explain or understand as seen in Freakonomics. Yes theres lots of ignorance out there about these topics but its the kind of thing that really could be addressed without too much controversy other than the effect of those peoples prejudices that would result.Its the world of macroeconomics where all the controversy comes out. This is where you need really special skills and knowledge that are admittedly way above my head and beyond the reach of most laymen. The thing is your post is painting a picture of a priesthood thats got its act together and generally agrees on the ideas. But this doesnt seem to exist in this field. Theories are all over the map with wide disagreement about even foundational concepts.

11562342,0,t1_dg6gz6b,gtIm not sure but I think the answer is no. If we were talking about renting a private apartment from a landlord I think the tenant has a reasonable expectation that the landlord isnt letting strangers come in to steal stuff. But you specifically said were talking about a public space so it doesnt sound like the venue owner has the same role as gatekeeper not even if you require tickets to attend. If an audience member is hogging the microphone for a noninterrogative monologue during the QampA session at your lecture its not the universitys job to throw them out if you invite strangers into your apartment and they smash a window its not the landlord who owes you a new pane. Practically speaking what usually happens in these situations is that for events where disturbances might be anticipated the venue owner will require the renter to also hire a security detail. So its approximately the same people providing the security service but that service is still distinct from the rental of the venue. You could have security problems that it should have been someones job to prevent anywhere not just in a venue you happen to be renting at the time e.g. the university should protect the security of anyone on its campus regardless of whether theyre at a controversial lecture or just reading in the library.When Ive seen security on campuses it had to go through their own security groups which were actual members of their own police department.  Ive never seen outside security that wasnt off duty police at the least. Maybe this is different at some places. Regardless if you rent a space and dont actually have exclusive use of it its not much of a rental is it?The really egregious and chilling effect events in my mind are the ones with large police presences that dont do anything but prevent effective defense.gtSo maybe we can greatly simplify this discussion if we just take the university out of the scenario and keep it simple? How about theres an antiwar protest in front of City Hall in a public square thats acknowledged as a freespeech zone and the protesters have all the necessary permits etc. but some of the protesters become ironically violent and start smashing windows and maybe a fight breaks out. Unregulated free expression ends in physical harm to property and people. It sounds like youre saying this is a frequent and predictable consequence of protests and I dont think the frequency is very high but Ill agree it has happened sometimes and will happen again. I think we also agree that when we know the protest in the public square is going to be large there should be supervision from police to make sure everything stays peaceful.Its not all that common for protests as a whole but not all protests are all that similar.A few windows Im not worried about that much. Force the permit holders to pay for the damage.  Fights?  Arrest those involved.  If the organizers are egging it on charge them as accessories.  If it becomes such that the police cant keep the peace order the crowd to disperse and actually force them to disperse.gtSo if I can isolate your point and distinguish it from others made here it sounds like you and Scott agree that unregulated free speech can lead to harm though Scott was talking about intellectual harm and youre talking about physical harm however Scott is appealing to the people who are exercising their free expression to do it a little more judiciously and youre appealing to the police to keep a firmer grip over free expression with harsher consequences for people who cross that line from peaceful expression to violent expression. Is that roughly what youre driving at? If so what do you make of the usual counterargument that closely and strictly monitoring free expression even without technically censoring any of it can still create a chilling effect that reduces the amount of freedom  is that less important than security? Theres quite a bit of middle thats excluded between the police acting in a stand down fashion and getting all jack boot thuggish on anyone not dressed up in their Sunday best silently holding a sign.If I were in the area I wouldnt mind going to a Milo event. Not exactly number one on my list though.I listened to an interview from some attendees to the Berkeley shitshow and they talked about how they went wearing some kind of stab proof vest because they were worried about being attacked.  They talked about being exposed to some kind of pepper spray type compound and being chased in the streets by masked people.  This is fucked.When that sort of thing is absolutely off the table then we can talk about the type of intellectual violence that may or may not really from inconvenient research or campy insults wrapped around a conservative message.Until then dont lend support to those groups by letting them dictate the discussion. If you cant avoid being forced to comply with their violence dont acknowledge them as if they had made some sort of rational moral or ethical argument.gtFYI if were still talking about the US this would require either a formal request for federal aid from the governor the invocation of the Insurrection Act of  or the repeal of the Posse Comitatus Act of  and in any of those cases Id expect a huge backlash against using the military to repress civilians free expression even though the police who usually do it are so militarized already.

11663921,0,t1_dgi01vn,I agree that people concerned about AI risk do not necessarily need to believe that horrible consequences are likely in order to be concerned. I think this brings us back to the broader point of my comment which is that whether or not various views are supported by scientific consensus really does depend a lot on definitions. In this case it depends on what we consider the range of views encompassed by concerned about AI risk to be. Either way it seems like we would need to admit that the survey is inconclusive about whether or not the consensus supports concern about AI risk because the questions dont incorporate the totality of the AI risk position. I think people should be careful about claiming that scientific consensus supports specific positions especially opinions that they happen to support because it is easy to focus on aspects of the consensus that agree with your favored position but ignore aspects that disagree or are ambiguous.,slatestarcodex,dgi4cek,1,t5_30m6u

11710134,0,t3_673le4,The mods have asked me to skip over groupspecific links from now on so moving on in the pleiotropy section we come to some of the coolest  and to me surprising  studies done in the past few years the genetic correlation and phenome papers!Here we see that not just are almost all interesting traits under considerable genetic control as established by twinfamilyGCTAGWAS studies ad nauseam all of these genotypes and phenotypes exist in an intricate complex network in which overlapping sets of genes influence multiple causally connected traits producing rich patterns of correlation which reflect both possible causal origins schizophrenia and infection? and also broad patterns of health and disease. Particularly with intelligence we get a remarkably consistent set of results where intelligence correlates with desirable traits and inversely correlates with undesirable ones. This has major implications for sociology and medicine as it explains why genetic confounds are such a major issue because diseases and low intelligence drag each other around universally in almost a sort of general phenotypic factor of goodnessbadness and appear everywhere and is at least part of why poor people are sick  sick people are poor and the concentration of misery that Scott has discussed on SSC before as a major puzzle in social relations. This also has implications for more applied matters like embryo selection selecting for intelligence will drag along almost entirely good traits while also selecting against bad ones but also casts a new light on the old puzzle of why there are any individual differences in intelligence due to genetics at all  it may be pervasive mutation load with intelligence as the most fragile complex trait and affected by damage to all bodily systems. All in all a very interesting and underappreciated set of results so I hope people will spend some time reading over the papers and puzzling over the correlation matrices and asking themselves the implications.,slatestarcodex,dgndg8x,15,t5_30m6u

11743711,0,t1_dgqh17m,People who I know have said some of the following all of which are slightly true or kind of true but ultimately not fully true. They related to diet and exercise.. Skinny people can eat whatever they want without gaining any weight  its true that some studies show a minority of people can eat far above maintenance and not gain fat. However the majority of skinny people are skinny because they eat close to maintenance andor have high NEAT. If you really want to you can probably gain weight. Just overeat on junk food for months on end. If you do that for months counting calories to make sure youre not overestimating food intake and you still cant gain weight then youre probably in that minority.. Its impossible for me to gain weight no matter how much I eat.  in this case I had directly observed this persons eating habits for a couple of weeks admittedly not in detail but I saw some of their meals. They simply had tiny meals. Thats why they were very underweight like  lbs at  for a male and struggled to gain muscle. They might be one of the minority who struggle to gain weight even with a surplus but its more likely they were just bad at eating a lot or estimating calorie intake.. After seeing me eat a truly massive meal they told me Its not fair you dont gain weight no matter what you eat.    After  months of intentionally overfeeding myself and gaining  lbs Im pretty sure theyre wrong. Im an infrequent eater. I generally prefer large single meals so the apparent quantity I consume if you see me eat that one big meal is quite large. . Another friend of mine and family members upon hearing I wanted to gain weightmuscle told me it would be impossible with my frame. While there seems to be a correlation this is gradeA broscience so a quick Pubmed search reveals no studies with these search terms  between frame size approximated by wrist and ankle circumference and natural muscle building potential it doesnt mean its impossible or even unlikely for someone of my build to gain substantial muscle. Yes most research studies on muscle hypertrophy show a range of response with a minority of participants not building any or much muscle within the timeframe of the study. Some people are truly nonresponders. Its hard to get estimates but Ive seen Greg Nuckols who writes great evidencebased strenthtraining articles ballpark true non responders to hypertrophy at a couple of clients out of several hundred source a FB post of his on march  .  I dont pass moral judgement on fat or underweight or unfit people so this doesnt bother me in the fatpeoplehate sense. But I dont like incorrect information that sounds somewhat true especially when people say it mostly as a way of minimizing personal responsibility and reducing the possibility of changing themselves.Im not saying youre doing this.

11749506,0,t3_67egnu,gt Adding to all of this is the socalled buffet effect where people will eat more calories from a variety of foods presented together than they would from any single food alone. My mother likes to talk about her extra dessert stomach ie the thing where you can gorge yourself on a burger and fries until youre totally full and couldnt eat another bite  but then mysteriously find room for an ice cream sundae afterwards. This is apparently a real thing thats been confirmed in scientific experiments and a major difference between us and our ancestors.So what counts as a variety of foods presented together and what counts as a single food?Im curious because my approach to cooking is to do everything in the same container. So Ill have pasta and vegetables and mayonnaise but theyre totally mixed together on my plate. Do I probably eat less of them than if I put them onto a plate separately?

In the broad sense of just doing costbenefit analyses and caring about the well being of people well that covers people and governments across the political spectrum. I cant say that trying to figure out the consequences of a policy really has led to a great amount of disutility. Also it is strange that you criticize utilitarian ideologies for causing disutility.
