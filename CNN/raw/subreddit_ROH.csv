3039382,0,t1_cocwvs4,OK I asked because its a lot easier to compare ROH to an indy show than to TNA or WWE. There will be plenty of opportunities for interaction some but not all of the wrestlers will come out at intermission  depending on the venue some will set up autograph tables. Its a very different atmosphere than WWE a little closer to the two TNA house shows I went to.,ROH,cod13vm,1,t5_2wjsr

3650399,0,t3_326dmb,Enjoyable show this week. Elgin and Ferrara was better than I had thought it would be and Ferrara is starting to impress me more with his work.So happy to see War Machine back  the tag division needs a bit of a shake up and this should be a good start. ACH vs QT was solid not a lot to say about the match. Pretty much exactly what you would expect. Styles vs Briscoe was awesome. More than a few times I thought Mark might be able to pull off the upset.  I hope we get to see this pairing again. ,ROH,cq8df2h,2,t5_2wjsr

4030054,0,t1_creq8qm,I am in agreement Im kind of falling out of favor with NXT to be honest so therefore I am not sure what else going to SC means to me.. I also cancelled my WWE Network prescription too just an overload and Im tired of them. SC has a Twitter and so do a couple other subs that I look on I think its just a good way to get more people here especially when shows are going on or things are trending just a thought Ill check the posts here everyday and see whats up... If I can do anything to help let me know ,ROH,crfnnrx,2,t5_2wjsr
4101513,0,t3_37l4tu,Im really not sure why so many people think this spells doom for TNA.ROH is a lowercost syndicated product  not firstrun television like TNA.  What this effectively means is that at a very low cost Destination America have now brought in a product that will likely bolster TNAs programming and viewership.TNAs problem for the past year has not been the inring product or even the storylines.  Their problem has been getting hardcore fans to tune in and give them a chance.  By bringing in ROH in the hour immediately preceding Impact DA are hoping to get hardcore fans to do just that  to stick around for TNA.Any way you slice it TNA will still be the flagship program.  Its first run its twice as long as ROH TV it has much higher production values and its more approachable to the nonhardcore audience.  ,ROH,crnsq7y,2,t5_2wjsr
4102030,0,t1_crnsq7y,The more I look at this the more I think TNA and ROHs deals might be dependent on each other. TNA needs to grow the audience and ROH can help them for sure with the more hard core fans. However ROH being in syndication  the RS Members  Thursdays online broadcast leads me to question if they can drive decent numbers alone for DA particularly as the DA showing is the second to last. I think the fact that ROHs current deal would be up in early December also speaks to this as if it doesnt work DA might just be done with Wrestling by the end of the year. ,ROH,crnuulm,2,t5_2wjsr

I hope I get to talk to Davey Vega about the AMA next week. Im also taking a buddy to his first indie show tonight so it should be fun as I usually go to these things alone.,ROH,cwqv1wx,2,t5_2wjsr
5714942,0,t3_3tbsqg,Best in the World is definitely the best place to start with if you plan to binge the product but I would also recommend War of the Worlds night  amp  as individual shows from an inring stand point. You wont find better shows in my opinion. They have a Black Friday coming in the next few days. Id suggest buying all  shows and having a blast. Hope this helps!,ROH,cx5ht15,3,t5_2wjsr
5979237,0,t3_3xb563,Im so stoked for this show. ROH has been on a nice run of high quality PPV events. Final Battle looks like a pretty stacked card and your write up did a great job filling in some of the matches I was not as aware of,ROH,cy3eqd2,3,t5_2wjsr
6526615,0,t3_450cle,Just a guess but I would bet it will be somewhere around the th as they normally dont tape too far ahead of the PPVs and the  Anniversary show will be coming up on the th.Might get to see it early though if a FOH or WOH match from those tappings are put up.,ROH,czuek4g,1,t5_2wjsr
7047278,0,t3_4bq92z,For me theres a lot that has gone down that is really important following Final Battle  from the build to LethalBriscoe for both the TV and World titles The Decades implosion Roderick Strongs journey back to becoming a champion the Tag title scene shifting after The Addiction won the title. Really a lot of whats happening now  Lethals reign the ColeOReilly feud the WhitmerPage feud New Japans growing dominance in ROH Dalton Castle and his stuff with Silas Young  all stem from major shows and TV episodes dating back to Spring . ,ROH,d1f60ij,2,t5_2wjsr
7673902,0,t3_4kemcs,I think he would be great in ROH. Very solid in ring. He would be able to put on some great matches with Lethal Strong and OReilly.,ROH,d3eh76p,11,t5_2wjsr

7979750,0,t1_d4czjc7,The Trios matches I saw had Daniel Moloney Trent Seven and Tyler Bate. Evidently the last two are a tag team called Mustache Mountain. They were really great kind of a British strong style if I heard the announcers correctly label them that. I enjoyed them and hope to see them again.Add this to the guys showing up in PWG and youre correct they are completely insane. Its almost like they voted as a country and decided to outperform NJPW!,ROH,d4czyvj,2,t5_2wjsr
8117971,0,t1_d4si1sy,The first WOH match of the relaunch was taped in July of last year in Baltimore prior to Death Before Dishonor. The interesting thing is that WOH matches from the relaunch now occupy the number one two and fifteen mostwatched matches in ROH history on their YouTube page. It is arguably their most popular YouTube series as the matches are now getting between k and k views easily with the two mostwatched videos heading toward becoming the first videos to reach one million views on their channel.Im wondering what the next step is. The social media buzz around the episode was pretty good and the episode was received favorably with the caveat being this was the first effort. Theyve maintained a consistent lead announcer and have used Whitmer Veda Scott and Nigel to fill in with Ian as appropriate so the brand has a pretty unique distinct identity from a presentation side to go along with its specific graphics etc.I wouldnt mind a once a year special on a PPV weekend where TV might not make sense to tape ahead of time to avoid spoilers. This was a good fit this week especially with the acknowledgement that there would be Best in the World news in the coming weeks.,ROH,d4sj6w9,1,t5_2wjsr
