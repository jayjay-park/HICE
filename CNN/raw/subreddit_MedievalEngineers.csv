2878147,0,t3_2t2zqo,So... does this means an Early Access version of Medieval Engineers is just around the edge so they would need to create a bug report thread in order to us report bugs?GODS BE PRAISED. GIVE IT TO ME. GIVE IT TO ME NOW.,MedievalEngineers,cnv8wff,10,t5_35v08
2883305,0,t1_cnvrt8w,to get peoples wallets ready. Generally speaking just releasing a product without any presell build up  date results in an uninformed and uninspired customer base. They might go this route of course but its unlikely.,MedievalEngineers,cnvu1q3,2,t5_35v08

3010435,0,t1_coa0cdq,Then dragging must have become accepted and hopeflly fixed by the devs since I last played.   Back when I played you would have to mess around with mouse settings to even get dragging to work. There were a handful of ingame communities that frowned upon dragging especially when you used the weapons that didnt drag properly such as the Zweihanders instant dragging overhead attack when the weapon is supposed to be slow. ,MedievalEngineers,coa12sr,1,t5_35v08

3088489,0,t1_coi3j9t,I think this game is more processor heavy than anything.   I only have one GTX And I am running smooth.   I am however getting a lot of floating blocks with structural integrety turned on.   ,MedievalEngineers,coi4bze,1,t5_35v08

3095182,0,t3_2vlv3t,I believe if you press Ctrlx on the structure to put it on your clipboard then paste it back in if you hit J before you place it it should change into a dynamic object. At least I think thats how I did it haha.,MedievalEngineers,coitbo7,2,t5_35v08

3111208,0,t1_cokgqmn,It seems like the game calculates how much torque is required to rotate things and that is basically just how much mass you are trying to move so larger gears turn slower. And once you add enough mass the character is no longer able to turn it by hand.seems like the rotor is much much stronger so try adding that as a motor.there is a little interact button on the front of the rotor that will start it,MedievalEngineers,cokh4sz,2,t5_35v08

3181747,0,t1_coroo75,Sadly it isnt that easy to develop a decent combat system. Which also depends on what decent is for me that would be around  sword swings left right and down and a bow that can be pulled to different degrees. More then that could be a massive waste of resources for Keen as they could have used that time to improve the engineering aspect of the game. Which is the main selling point. And the people that are looking for Medieval combat has many great titles to choose from.,MedievalEngineers,corscst,1,t5_35v08
3186477,0,t1_coru1pd,Yeah this game would be amaaazing as an mmo assuming it was properly balanced extremely nontrivial for games this sandboxy but Im not getting the impression that theyd be interested in prioritizing all that over the building mechanics so Ill be sticking to life is feudal til someone makes something better LiF is still pretty roughId vote against npc armies but its probably moot anyways.,MedievalEngineers,cosa1m3,2,t5_35v08

3206081,0,t1_couaqy1,Yeah I just tried a bit more. Its definitely debris. I did some experimenting and found that the new stone pillars have an interesting interaction with wood blocks the non floor wood.

4763837,0,t1_cts99hd,Swords actually work best in my opinion. And yes for now you must get your weapon upgrades from the enemy. Spawning during the day is a normal part and is usually only one barb.
