Since we then have no common ground for authority it is just one worldview against another which gets us nowhere.  I would just add that if you can pick and choose what you want to believe it is not Christianity anymore.  You are no longer following Christ merely foisting your own ideals upon Him.I will respond to the scripture you asked about since this is one you apparently believe to be true.  The issue in Samuel is that God is Israels king and the prophets are his mouthpiece.  The people jump the gun and in their rebellion are given their choice in order to teach them that Gods way is better like quail in the desert.  In Gods timing he instates David as king.  You will note that David absolutely respects Sauls appointment under God even though Saul was in rebellion against God.  Poignant.  David is confirmed as Gods choice under Samuel and this is reinforced many times as David himself is a prophet.  This section was not about government at all it was peoples rebellion against God.In the same way you are more interested in the blessings of God but not following His will.  He gave you His word which you dissect to meet your own ends.  You have established for yourself your own king one like Saul.  ,christiananarchism,cgunwm0,0,t5_2rkw4

This is a dead thread  nobody is reading this thread but you and me any more so youre not protecting anyone else.  Youre not going to change my mind  Ive read waaaaaaaaaaayyyyy too much and youd have to prove waaaaaaaaaayyyyyy too much evidence wrong in order to convince me.  Plus Im stubborn. If you want to know more about why I think the way I do on the subject of the Kingdom of God I would recommend you read N.T. Wrights book Surprised By Hope  Until you do that just dont argue with me about heaven being a place out there ok?,christiananarchism,chz7iyp,-1,t5_2rkw4
