6247275,0,t3_414k18,To follow up as Im reviewing what you wrote and what I wrote you should let him know that the crappy parts of the academy are nothing compared to the rewards. As a freshman I feel like I have grown immensely since I left and even though aspects of my life are not fun it is definitely manageable especially with the support system here. We do have fun here despite what you may hear even with the military lifestyle and additional freshman rules. He has every reason to go but if he still doesnt want it  then I wouldnt recommend that he apply.,USAFA,cyzqxcc,2,t5_2sdis

9135982,0,t3_553lgh,Do not bug your ALO but feel free to regularly contact them with questions not answered by google. I asked questions as I came up with them. Roughly twice a month I would find a new factor in the cadet experience that deserved a personal explanation. Before and especially after Summer Seminar saw a surge in contact as well. My interview was quicker than most because my ALO felt she came to know me over emails. ,USAFA,d8a1vxr,1,t5_2sdis
