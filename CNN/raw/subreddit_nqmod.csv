4265379,0,t1_cs6bg5s,The good news is if you do not like the fact that Spain has been nerfed you can simply download the single player version of the mod and remove the Spain nerf file from the folder. The point of the NQ mod includes balancing aspects of the game. Unfortunately due to Spains cool but overpowered ability it simply is not fair to the other players of the game if Spain is able to not only get  gold from each wonder it discovers first but  gold from a wonder period. Spain is not a useless civilization now remember the ability to double natural wonders yields is still there which quite honestly is the most important aspect of Spains UA. In my opinion it doesnt destroy the mod or the game just because the Conquistador was moved to Exploration. I personally never really felt a use in the conquistador anyway in most NQ games and I believe the unique circus is actually much more useful...  culture early on in the game is definitely very strong.,nqmod,cs6fcus,4,t5_37srp

4429991,0,t3_3bsdg9,Overall Im pretty happy with where the mod is at. All four openers are viable even piety which I won my last game with. The only change I would make here is a slight nerf to Tradition. With the free aqueducts and early Legalism its definitely the strongest tree again. As for later policy trees Patronage is good as is. Id love if Aesthetics could give tourism earlier. Most games seem to end by IndustrialModern era making cultural victories basically impossible.  Commerce feels weak at the moment. Including the opener it requires four subpar policies to get any of the good ones. I have very little incentive to choose this tree over Exploration or Rationalism. Exploration is awesome. Maybe overpowered but Im not convinced yet. I choose this over Rationalism about  of the time. Rationalisms still boring. Im in favor of turning it into a catchup tree to make it A. more interesting and B. make the late game more competitive.,nqmod,csp3918,4,t5_37srp

I would like them to be stronger though... It never made sense to me that windmills cant be built in cities on hills since irl I see them elevated along hills all the time to get better access to the wind!I do like the idea of being able to place observatories in cities two tiles away from a mountain. I think that would allow them to be used more often though I think if we went that route we would need to reduce the bonus it gives.I dont think Crossbows should upgrade to a siege unit but rather that there should be a separate two tile ranged unit path such as a grenadier and later a mortar.

5534300,0,t1_cwiwv4v,Thing is if you make Denmarks UB so powerful that it makes them at least a twotrick pony it will be too powerful of a UB eg. it would be like Arabia having a second unique component that is as powerful as camels.If you make their UB something that hyper focuses them on berserker rushes it must be a flat production UB that unlocks at late Ancient Era as anything later isnt worth dedicating hammers to before the rush to be balanced for Ancient Era the UB would have to give at most  or  hammers as a bonus compare to Steles  faith and Paper Makers effective  gold though Pyramids  science  faith is way above the curve which given Berserker hammer costs would maybe equate to saving one turns worth of production for every  Berserkers produced. It would be too weak to be worth dedicated the second unique component to. Worst of all even if it was powerful enough to noticeably help berserker rushes the nature of flat production would make the bonus basically become irrelevant after Medieval so Denmark become even more of a onetrick pony. This is in addition to the issue that the tech tree is laid out in such a way that people doing a berserker rush want to pick up Optics at least after Metal Working so a UB that doubles down on berserker rushes could not be one that replaces a naval building so Denmarks naval flavor must be ignored. Oh and lets not forget that if a civ is too much of a onetrick pony everyone will immediately expect the player to use that trick and preemptively counter it causing the civ to perform even worse in practice than on paper see Arabias camels.The best option is to instead have a UB that isnt overly powerful but is still allround useful and not a waste of a unique like Maori Warriors or Krepost. Mead Halls may not be as convenient as Workshops or Universities but I can definitely see a lot of players building Mead Halls before Temples Gardens or even Barracks conveniencewise theyre placed in such a tech tree position that people dont feel the need to rush for them thereby ruining their chances at a berserker rush but when they unlock Mead Halls later on they will always be useful. Mead Halls are also just as powerful as Satraps for their era though very few things are as powerful as Steles Satraps provide  happy  gold on an early Renaissance building that normally has mediumhigh priority and costs  hammers while Mead Halls effectively add  happy  gold  on coast on a Classical building that normally has mediumlow priority and costs  hammers Colosseums cost  hammers. Worst case scenario you have a maintenancefree building that gives  happy and costs  hammers on top of Colosseums that give  happy  gold and cost  hammers. Best case scenario you also get the regular effects of a Lighthouse in noncoastal cities and an extra  gold ie. half of a Paper Maker in coastal ones. Sure its not Stele Pyramid or Burial Tomblevels of powerful but if it were it would ruin berserker rushes why should people go for a weird unorthodox strategy when they could take the safe road get that OP UB and treat Berserkers the way Maya treats Atlatlists ie. like a novelty but nothing special?In any case whether or not the suggested UB is powerful enough would ultimately be determined by iterative testing even if you think Mead Halls arent powerful enough Id still say theyre still better than Ski Infantry which are basically getting no use ATM and if Mead Halls end up not being worth it for their hammer cost we could always add another  gold on top andor make it cost less hammers eg.  hammers would make it Granarycost.,nqmod,cwj20hk,1,t5_37srp

Trying the same setup by changing chukonus with regular xbows and berserkers with regular longswordsmen will yield the same results.And fortifying on hills? Soaking damage? Do you think youre playing an mmo? Blocker units arent tanks and there are no healers to keep them alive. The point of winning against a ranged enemy is to deny their range advantage by using knights strong ranged positions of your own etcetera. Anyone can say theyre an experienced player that doesnt mean anything to anyone and it certainly doesnt give you any credibility when youre simply wrong and continue to demonstrate how horribly wrong your whole thinking is.Bottom line you tried a frontal assault against an enemy that had superior position and all tactical advantages there are against you.

6628190,0,t3_46eysw,I think there are plenty of ideologies and policies that favor tall cities vs wide. The problem is the map and early game favor wide and now they have policies that are very strong late as well. I think the problems stem from HB map which is amazing HB dont get me wrong which produces a lot of meh to good city spots but very few great city spots.  This means you usually get one really good expansion then you are looking at much weaker cities. For tradition that hurts for liberty or piety it is great you just settle everywhere. So I would change things in tradition so it can compete early while still being good late on a few tall cities. remove happiness from aristocracy you take this policy to build wonders early not for happiness want this power later in tree.  monarchy add each unique lux in the elite give  additional happiness. This is stronger early than aristocracy happiness but weaker later unless you war which tradition will still be the weakest at. Importantly it gives even more early happiness to help get your cities up and running.  landed elite I would gut it. Instead have it give  production for every  food in each city.  Reduce production cost of building military units by  per  food capped at   food. This gives them a small boost in production early while focusing growth letting them compete better with early liberty aggression. It is weak if you have small cities and grows in power with larger cities. finisher give it  food in cap was on landed elite reduce growth in all cities from  to . Big cap is a hallmark of tradition so nerf is to slightly balance this.Series of changes that help tradition settle early and grow while opening up more land to them. Jungles now become a little nicer as you get a little production from food. River systems improve for the same reason. So rather than struggling as tradition to find  great expanding spots you can be a little more flexible. This also helps counter act the number of stables resources in the HB map which is part of why wide can be SOOOOO ridiculous from a production stand point early in particular early when they didnt have the happiness to grow.,nqmod,d04wu7y,-6,t5_37srp

That being said Diety is indeed somewhat luck based as you said and this is true even without the mod. If you get bad land or you get suckered into a bunch of costly wars you can basically be screwed. As for science you should be caught up before Modern ends at the latest preferably sooner. You need your National College asap work your university slots always. Complete Rationalism.You should almost never build military if you can get away with it. There simply isnt the time. Make friends with your neighbors settle defensive cities and bribe the other ai to attack each other instead of you. A skeleton defense force is all you should have unless you are at serious risk of attack or plan on attacking someone yourself. Build forts with your workers. A defensive city with fortified units in forts can be impossible for the ai to punch through even with crazy superior numbers. Sell your horses and iron to the ai. You dont have time to build a military and they will pay your for it. Trade and sell luxuries too of course.Never build wonders without an engineer except for Oracle or Social Policy based wonders. If theres only one other guy in tradition look in his land to see if hes building Hanging Garden before attempting it Check out FilthyRobots Wonder Spotting Video. Oracle is pretty safe until turn . Try to finish it before then if you want it.The best defense against a hostile culture victory is winning the worlds fair. Never propose it in the first congress because otherwise it times poorly with wanting to build factories and public schools. Propose it in the second congress if you still can otherwise the ai probably will anyway. Make sure you win it stop everything else you are doing. Going into Aesthetics also helps defend yourself.Given that land is usually tight Tradition gt Aesthetics gt Rationalism gt Freedom works very well in Diety games. Make sure you get Statue of Liberty if you do this. You dont have to go Freedom if youd rather have something else. Order is of course godly in the current version of the mod so maybe you would prefer that if you have a strong enough culture game to finish Rationalism and go deep into Order.Hope some of these tips help.

8642665,0,t1_d6lx8kv,Chess engines evaluate a position based on a positionevaluating algorithm and come back with a result measured in centipawns then they look at sequences of moves which they think are relevant using an algorithm which attempts to prune the game tree and put those through their positionevaluation algorithm then they use minmax navigation of the pruned tree that theyve created to suggest the best move. Human players are somewhat different especially in terms of the navigation itself. I wrote a paper about this for a stats class a couple of years ago if you feel like nerding out about chess theory and typetwo rationalism which found that moderatelyskilled human chess players could make moves against computer recommendations without hurting their results in a situation where their opponent was a stronger player than them and their mistake move reduced the material count on the board The game tree of chess creates unknown information by being too big for anyone to harvest all of the information from it. This is the same thing as adding randomness to a tree it doesnt break the tree such that people cant work out which one theyre meant to analyze it turns the tree into a larger space with probabilistic as well as deliberate navigation forcing more calculations to decide the values of its nodes and consequently adding unknown information by making it too large to harvest. For example the NLHE tree branches  times when the flop is dealt then another  and  times for the turn and river. Its still one tree though there are just nodes which are navigated probabilistically rather than based on player decision.I agree that lategame Civ has far less unknown information in it than earliergame Civ although Ive seen plenty of highlevel games where players arent sure whether they or an opponent are completing a win condition first. Lategame is a place where variable damage pulls a lot of weight in making the game more interesting. Even looking at only combat in that situation though things like latency and firstmove mean that you dont know everything about a combat situation when you are making your decisions in it. There are plenty of situations which are difficult to execute because you dont actually have perfect information on the realtime combat situation.But yeah in general we agree and I voted that we should have damage rolls in the strawpoll and enjoy your points and this conversation .edit Re Heuristics heuristics can be great but they can also be terrible and I dont think the way that we create heuristics for Civ always gives us good ones nor do I think people are very good at all at getting rid of the bad ones that they pick up in Civ. In Chess basic heuristics like prioritize king safety or control the center can help a beginning player but the fact that we have engines which can instantly show us our mistakes allows stronger players to evolve past them. In Civ even our good heuristics are primitive like those and some are actively bad and we have few or no tools to identify bad ones or evolve past good ones.,nqmod,d6lxytl,1,t5_37srp
8688208,0,t3_4yza0a,Yes this is normal. The way ideological pressure works is as follows. If you go to the ideological happiness tab on the culture overview then hover over a players happiness you will be presented with this overview. In this example Carthage has  pressure for freedom and  for both autocracy and order. Pressure is acquired for each level of influence the other player has on you. This pressure can be counteracted by your own tourism if you are exotic over them and they are exotic over you you will receive no ideological pressure.Another way to get pressured is through the world ideology resolution. If this gets passed the corresponding ideology gets  pressure on every player in the game. Counteracting this one is basically out of your control youd need another civ of your own ideology to have  ideological pressure on you.The reason you went unhappy is thus that while you are pressuring everyone out nobody seems to have any pressure on you or at least nobody who is order. So the only pressure you are receiving or the net greatest in case someone with both order and freedom were pressuring you is from freedom and thus you gained dissidents causing you to go unhappy. ,nqmod,d6rnj8x,8,t5_37srp

8782204,0,t1_d73d90i,Well yeah but youre not refuting my two points.A lot of bugs in unmodded Civ have been known so long that their use abuse? has been integral to highlevel Civ play yet people are completely fine with having those bugs fixed in NQMod. Making use of bugs like radaring teamer science costs and GS bulbs changing their science value as the game progresses are all vital to unmodded Civ gameplay and they all present interesting choices for the player like when exactly do they want to pop their GS and how far should they move their army out of their borders for a backstab if they dont want to be spotted by radaring note the citizen growth thing doesnt actually present the player with any choices it simply presents the player with a calculation challenge where they are to calculate out the best way to fiddle with their tiles so that a newly grown citizen is allocated to the right tile any tile allocation combination that does not maximize yields is a bad one there is no choosing involved only a calculation. However many of the people who are complaining about the citizen allocation bug being fixed as a result of the change are the same ones who support or are supporting those other bugs being fixed even though the other bugs have existing in Civ for just as long and their use is just as integral to victory. Why is having to corral the citizen manager desirable but something like having to plan around teamer science costs favoring teams where one player plays OCC undesirable?The yields and stats are so interwoven during turn processing that any single exception to yields caching will have undesirable ripple effects. For example lets say cached yields remain in their entirety for everything except food. The first problem comes from food yield modifiers the amount of arguments that can be used in their function calls is limited by the games Lua libraries so theres no way to tell a food yield modifier function to fetch cached empire happiness instead of current empire happiness which means that if food isnt cached happiness is also not cached when it is checked for food. Not only does this mean that anything run before growth processing that can affect happiness might also affect growth the turn it is run e.g. a building built a tech researched a lux deal expiring but because growth processing for cities must be done onebyone it means that growing in a city to become unhappy applies a growth penalty to all cities processed after the current one but not growth penalty to the cities processed before the current one. The next problem comes from code ordering the very thing cached yields are supposed to address. If food yields arent cached where the growth processing loop is placed incode will always cause some sort of ripple effect onto food yields. For example if growth processing is done the way it is now golden age modifiers e.g. from a UA will get applied to food one turn before they get applied to other yields and golden age modifiers will end one turn before they do for other yields. Cities in resistance will generate food the turn they leave resistance while they will only generate other yields the turn after they leave resistance since that would be after the player has had time to reallocate citizens manually. If growth processing is moved to the very end of turn processing then every single change that affects food generation from building a new wonder to automatically faith purchasing a food building will affect food yields the same turn they are run. Finally having food not be cached but everything else be cached still means that newly grown citizens wont earn anything from the tile they are allocated to. Any hammers theyd earn is ignored because hammers are cached any culture theyd earn is ignored because culture is cached any GPPs theyd earn is ignored because GPPs are cached etc. This sort of exception would not give cached yields detractors anything theyd want since growing a citizen would still not allow the citizen to earn yields from its newly allocated slot it would just give room for the sort of unintuitive behaviors that wed want to avoid.,nqmod,d73g3kk,4,t5_37srp
8806396,0,t1_d763062,Just to clarify Ive been curious about this for a while would we need specifically Aspyrs tools the company that ported Civ to convert the DLL to be Mac usable? I assume thats why weve never had DLL mods on Mac since Aspyr hasnt release those tools like Firaxis has released the mod kit for PC. Its just that I see in the Mac games files libCvGameCoreDLLDLL.dylib etc Dylib is the Mac version of DLL so I was just wondering is it possible Im not a coder to take the DLL code from and run it through something like XCode on Mac to create the Dylib version?,nqmod,d76er06,1,t5_37srp
8910065,0,t1_d7ip5pm,Poking ufruitstrike and uHellBlazerNQI pasted the base games relevant coding section  comments for start bias at the bottom. The full file CIVCivilizations.xml can be found at CYOURFILEPATHHEREsteamappscommonSid Meiers Civilization VAssetsDLCExpansionGameplayXMLCivilizationsCIVCivilizations.xmlThe functionality for making a river bias civ is in the base code of the game but it actually not used. Firaxis DID have America in there but it is in fact commented out by the lt! gt.Therefore America does NOT have a river start bias. America since Vanilla BNW all the way to NQMod V has had None Start BiasWhether or not to include Americas river start bias is up to your balancing decision. Speaking with the old Unique Components Extra sight cheaper tile gold purchasing the Minuteman and B dont really revolve around the rivers like Incas mobility UA and terrace farms revolve around the hills from the hills bias or Songhais new mobility UA revolves around the rivers.Regarding the new V Alpha Version America the Unique components revolve around moving through rough terrain but not really moving across  around rivers. The Minuteman and Pioneer do have a consistent theme of ignoring terrain cost when moving but that qualifies America as much for a jungleforesthills start bias as a river start bias. Hence I dont feel strongly about Americas None Start bias one way or another most people are also far more concerned with the whole pioneer free worker concept in terms of balancing America rather than its start bias. Its completely your call if you want to reimplement the river starting bias Firaxis left on the cutting room floor.Songhai on the other hand really has a UA in this new build that specifically revolves around taking advantage of rivers for maximum impact. According to the comments left by Firaxis giving Songhai a river bias would mean that it gives up its Avoid Tundra start bias. Im not super familiar with the NQMap script but from the small sample size that is my personal experience of playing on it there is essentially no Snow and barely any Tundra to begin with on HellBlazers NQ Pangea. Hence Songhai giving up Avoid Tundra is not a big deal since it is irrelevant to NQMod games with the NQMod map while a new rivers start bias would really help Songhai utilize its new UA from the get go.lt! NOTE TO MODDERS Each Civ can belong to only one of the four Start Bias categories listed below. gtlt! If a Civ has entries in any of the four following tables any entries in later tables will end up being ignored. gtlt! So... Coastal bias trumps River bias trumps Region Priority trumps Region Avoid. gtlt! The best practice is to pick only one of the four types or none for each civilization. gtltCivilizationStartAlongOceangtltRowgtltCivilizationTypegtCIVILIZATIONENGLANDltCivilizationTypegtltStartAlongOceangttrueltStartAlongOceangtltRowgtltRowgtltCivilizationTypegtCIVILIZATIONOTTOMANltCivilizationTypegtltStartAlongOceangttrueltStartAlongOceangtltRowgtltRowgtltCivilizationTypegtCIVILIZATIONJAPANltCivilizationTypegtltStartAlongOceangttrueltStartAlongOceangtltRowgtltCivilizationStartAlongOceangtltCivilizationStartAlongRivergtlt!ltRowgtltCivilizationTypegtCIVILIZATIONAMERICAltCivilizationTypegtltStartAlongRivergttrueltStartAlongRivergtltRowgtgtltCivilizationStartAlongRivergtlt!

10733320,0,t1_ddn0us4,I agree that the game should not be passive and simcity oriented I am a very aggressive player and never pick Piety because of how passive it is. The problem is that with the trees as they are youre not getting long early wars because Honour players have incentives to build nothing but military while TraditionPiety players have incentives to use their scarce hammers on infrastructure that will make them relevant in the longterm. TraditionPiety offers too little production and zero arguably negative benefit from early war.This is my entire point. Making Honour viable as a warmonger civ had the intention of causing war but has resulted in the opposite in that early wars between an Honour player and others tend to end very quickly.Imagine you spawn next to Huns with a nice Tradition start. You pick tradition before you meet your neighbour. Theyve gone Honour and have been building nothing but horse archers since turn . Whats your play? Theres no point in fighting because youll never win. Like the game modelled above your logical strategy is to build infrastructure and hope they target someone else or no one. Thats the issue.,nqmod,ddn289k,1,t5_37srp
