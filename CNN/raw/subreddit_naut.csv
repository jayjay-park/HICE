6095320,0,t1_cybgl9b,Wow nice work! Your addons for Naut have helped me quite a few times. Is there any chance of combining this one with the Somewhat Smaller Header addon from the Naut Wiki so it would be possible to have both the removed sidebar picture and the px header as well? The default header in Naut . is px but this is a bit too large for the theme im trying to achieve. I have tried adapting your script myself to support the smaller header but wasnt able to make it work despite spending a good hour on it. Also do you know how to completely remove the bit in the sidebar description where it says Subreddit Info including the user count and flair selection underneath?Cheers!,naut,cyih45y,1,t5_2w8j2

10966565,0,t1_deb460m,Youre welcome. And absolutely you may ask! You should always ALWAYS copy code directly from the Raw button on a source files GitHub page. This ensures that any Unicode characters are properly rendered. What happens when you simply copypaste directly from its repository on GitHub rather than the raw source file is that you wind up with improper character renderings the web browser gets confused.Here is a screenshot of this happening on your sub,naut,deb4gx1,1,t5_2w8j2
