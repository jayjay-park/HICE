3455196,0,t3_2zt8ix,I think this kind of game could be really interesting although I have no experience with it myself. If you have an engaged group that enjoy storytelling andor creative writing it could be really great.If you do try it with your friends I would love to hear a report on how it works out.,skinnyghost,cpm49yj,1,t5_371fw

3694020,0,t3_32pe1t,Its a really interesting looking mechanic and it reads interestingly. Id like to play a game with it being implemented to see how it works. Though I do see the obvious issue of if I want to play a game that uses this mechanic I have to be playing on a computer so I can use a dice roller.,skinnyghost,cqdccn1,1,t5_371fw
3753338,0,t3_2zpeuh,When I DM I like to make sure to make my NPCs varied in terms of personality and coloration. While I enjoy playing strategist dudes Ive tried to get away from that. For E I recently built a minstrelbackground paladin of vengeance who will multiclass into warlock via involuntary pact who is black. I wrote a really deranged bio to explain his personality as a sort of slightly irrational and emotionally bent guy. Then the idea is that whenever someone invokes his triggers he will get passionately violent... you might even say... Inspired. He should die gloriously instead of accidentally conquering Faerun as I do when I insert myself as a character.,skinnyghost,cqk3vqq,1,t5_371fw

4271443,0,t3_39j5ci,Im late to the party but just watched the Youtube vids. I know you havent got this far yet but I think if I were in you guys shoes Id be tempted to make one large Wild faction that functions kinda like the Rebel faction in total war games. Its the default and its super powerful but it doesnt act in an intelligent cohesive and strategic way possibly even randomising actions. So it spawns assets maybe only Might and Weird and populates otherwise unpopulated hexes attacking anything that passes through its hex and is basically a super faction with high stats infinite HP and lots of wealth but is less actively aggressive and tactial than true fations. This would be the faction that owned the lizard men manticore the wolves and goblins that repopulated the elven tomb ect. Basically it would fill the blank space on the map whilst still functioning through the same basic mechanics.Then you have normal factions like the flenzworm serpents of grief and the ascendant powers etc. and what have you who are generally buffered by the Wild who they can battle and expand into without fear of a cohesive retaliation but once theyve expanded they start butting head with other Real Factions who are going to get pissed and go after you if you start attacking their shit or getting in their way. Perhaps somemostall proper factions are just assets of the Wild that got powerful enough to break away and form their own faction so Hextia would be a Wild faction asset now but potentially will become her own faction if she goes unchallenged long enough? Maybe for the Wild Experience is tied to assets instead of the Faction which the asset can use as points for buying stats when transitioning to a faction? Maybe they win mad XP and get promoted for killing PCs like in Shadow of Mordor?Perhaps factions are agents of orderlaw opposed to the default of the Wild ie chaos? And a transition from asset of Wild to Faction represents that assets attempt to assert its dominance and order over the world.Do you think something like that might work in theory? Would it fit the feel of West Marches?  ,skinnyghost,cs73xe9,2,t5_371fw

4492196,0,t1_csuv8ul,Looked over the Silent Legions faction system it does have some refinements over the SWN system that work better.  Upkeep Move Asset action Lack of Tech LevelsIm going to see if I can replace Sorcery assets with appropriately themed Cunning assets make a hybrid of the two systems. Naively SWN is themed better but the SL subsystem might be more appropriate. Thanks for the suggestion ,skinnyghost,cswwgoh,1,t5_371fw

4684705,0,t1_ctl1hwl,Hmmm well in Apocalypse world its not so much about challenging the players abilities its more about putting them in places to choose between things.  You can never really have a fight that gun lugger cant fight. A skinner will always have the hotness to win the day in social stuff.   In apocalypse world the players are really intentionally set up as special their playbooks are just theirs alone. If you want to challenge them you need either raw numbers things outside their movesets to deal with or you just force them to choose which things to pursue and which to let fester to bite them later. ,skinnyghost,ctl1whu,3,t5_371fw

4983497,0,t1_cumoiag,Its cool that you have this giant death ray that needs to eat a planet in order to shoot but the only reason that you would shoot the giant death ray was to feed it to it.I assume all their technology looks like this so now they cant even leave until they feed the Earth to their warp coil.I guess it could work like a neutrino cannon so the planets technology and resources arent damaged. But honestly a very small percentage of the planets biomass is made up of humans. Why attack worlds inhabited by sentient creatures? You could argue they dont think we were and the death lazer was just the first step to making earths biomass more edible.Whats cool about this is that you could argue that some of the other living things on earth might have become sentient so you could have sentient bug swarms plants or sea life fighting alongside Earths Mightiest Heroes. The aliens could be infiltrating the planet with the ships subsystems Perhaps they are like parasitic wasps and this is just how you grow more bulkheads and explosive consoles. In the meantime hosts are mobile and controllable so you can just move them into place before you trigger their final transformation.,skinnyghost,cump2kx,2,t5_371fw

5414640,0,t3_3p5tuo,I think in other parts of the SWN materials it is described as though you could perfectly cut through anything you point the muzzle at. As if the muzzle were firing a solid blade of great length that could cut anything. There is no implication of other visual effects no burning or dematerializing  simply cutting.Naturally if you do this to a living human youre going to have blood spray to some degree depending on where the cut is. And if you cut any lower than say the shoulder blades youre going to see the target not only flay apart but also crumble to the ground as their structural ability to be upright becomes a nonfactor. The killing blows would assume that you cut a target through something vital or the target body entirely. Or if you want to be more depressing you can describe a target so cut up that one additional little scratch pushed them over the threshold into death.If you wanted to get really gross though you could interpret that the repulsor field is pushing apart the material it cuts. So cutting a persons arm off becomes more flashy their arm shoots off like a rocket as the shear field severs it from the body. Messy.,skinnyghost,cw3s1zc,2,t5_371fw

7246401,0,t3_4eoaod,My thoughts and ideas on some ways to apply some of the ideas from the discussions from this episode of Hack AttackMission RewardsBalancingMissions carry a difficulty rating or challenge level that provides an amount of Duty to the faction that completes the mission. This Duty can convert into a certain amount of Public Opinion or earn resources or both. Challenge Rating   Duty   Public Opinion OR  Resources  Challenge Rating   Duty   Public Opinion AND  Resources OR  Resources OR  Public Opinionfor example.The BalanceThe Balance is the neutral starting tug of war for Public Opinion from which every mission causes the Public Opinion to improve or worsen. Upon hitting certain tiers of strength on the tug o war you gain global mission bonuses that would help you during missions. Resource PoolsEach faction has a resource pool that increases though Sidequests or Secondary Goals achieved during missions or can sabotage the other Factions resources. These resources will over time unlock new tools and other bonuses provided the resources remain.Chat InvolvementChat would gain the ability to vote on ways to either do one of a few things provide help or mission to the faction currently aligned with them provide a neutral mission or goal that can show up and affect the story outside of faction loyalty a dangerous mission or event that affects the faction currently opposed to chat and lastly a mission that works as a redemption or sabotage mission to curry favour.,skinnyghost,d21v4dq,3,t5_371fw
