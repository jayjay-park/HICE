1080897,0,t1_chqzc31,Seems the album could have a sexual component then. I like your assessment and I have to admit I dont know much of their other albums. I saw them live at the Greek in LA about  years ago and the show was unbelievable. Nearly transcendent.Based on your comment Im going to spend some time listening to more of them. Theres a part of me that doesnt want to hear anything that may disrupt my connection to this album at least on a personal level. ,sigurros,chr5fw0,2,t5_2sqpi

2888755,0,t3_2t7ink,The two versions are so different yet I love them both equally. The original is such a beautiful peaceful ambientish song and the drumming combined with the acoustic guitar makes it really unique in their catalogue. In my opinion the best song out of the album.The Hvarf version however is a lot more of what youd expect from a Sigur Rs song. And its amazing. So much emotion on the singing really beautiful.,sigurros,cnwgdmt,6,t5_2sqpi

5867307,0,t3_3vjlip,easily  Kveikurthe chorus just booms with a sinister feel that ive never heard from JonsiKveikur and Brennisteinn both signify Sigur Ros ability to make music that isnt always dreamy and pleasant. They can also make music that sounds like a villains theme or the theme to an evil voclano or whatever,sigurros,cxoqgtu,2,t5_2sqpi

8738758,0,t1_d6wptvz,Hahaha! No. Most people here think theyre super weird and dont like them. From my experience their Icelandic fanbase is split up like this Like  Love them. Indifferent  Havent heard of them. Loathe them  Think they sound like cats.I love them though I think many people see more charm in the music when they dont understand the lyrics which are often very weird.,sigurros,d6xztdj,1,t5_2sqpi
