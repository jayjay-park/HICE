3651141,0,t3_326t4o,I fairly recently completed The Lost after about  or so failed attempts. I agree the Stopwatch is one of the best items to keep you from being damaged and if you dont have it yet donate as much as you can each time you play as The Lost. Youll have it in no time!,thebindingofisaac,cq8ggjq,3,t5_2tb8f

10348770,0,t3_5o55jl,You could cheat but thats super boring. THE best way is to just do it try and get a good run and just finish as much as possible! So go through almost everything in one run. Like Boss rush heart hush cathedral chest mega satan. You can do all that in one run then its only sheol and dark room left which is piece of cake!Good luck! ,thebindingofisaac,dch3ctz,2,t5_2tb8f
