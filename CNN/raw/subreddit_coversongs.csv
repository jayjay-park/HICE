774149,0,t1_cgs7xe0,Wow.... I seriously did not expect this reception being a virtually unknown language and all. Thank you so so much.gt Please share more with us.As I have posted in another comment I published a selfedited record on Friday here it is There are  covers and  original songs.gt Are the words a literal translation of Wonderwall?In fact this is a mashup between Wonderwall and What You Know by Twoo Door Cinema Club and the lyrics are from the latter. The translation tries to be as close to the song as I could but of course I had to adapt some things to make them fit lyrically. And when I started working on it I was surprised about how much I had to figure out about the meaning of the song. Because some things are veeery ambiguous in English but they are not at all in my language an vice versa. Plus I think these lyrics are particularly abstract. It was a challenge but I had a lot of fun doing it.,coversongs,cgs9wyl,3,t5_2rfkn

1305117,0,t3_290esd,Wow I am surprised nobody has commented yet. Alright. The first bit was rough. To paraphrase Mitch Hedberg youve got to start strong and end strong. You cant be like pancakes where youre fucking sick of them at the end. You ended well. Just started a big dully if that makes sense. You seemed to get your steam at the line with red dress. Your voice is quite gruff but in a good way. Its at odds with how the Lana Del Ray sings it which makes it a good cover instead of just an imitation. I havent looked through the rest of your videos yet but I think you should try a song with more range. I felt like this one was holding you back a bit. I do think youd benefit from a different area in which you record. This one is a bit too echoey Im afraid.  ,coversongs,cigfxmi,2,t5_2rfkn
