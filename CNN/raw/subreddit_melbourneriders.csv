4355370,0,t1_csfjzct,What it has been is simply an overtake.  Keep on the correct side of the white line while youre overtaking the vehicle on their right and youre okay.  As long as your not doing anything deemed dangerous or whatever by the Law.  Its a bit of a grey area.  Ive seen people split at a great rate of knots  traffic is doing kmh and Barry Brassballs is hoofing it through at .  At least these rules nullify the need to keep on the left of the lineright of the overtaken vehicle.  And put a lid on cowboys for their own safety.It looks like the survey is carefully worded to be confusing so if you save love it!! to all three of the scenarios it looks like your either contradicting yourself or are advocating filtering to be allowed on roads which have speed limits of greater than kmh have electronic speed signs etc etc....,melbourneriders,csgl010,2,t5_3332h

I think the consensus is that the pre  models are the derestricted and most sought after models but  ones are a bit old and dont look as good IMHO.  You may get lucky and find a garage queen that hasnt much on the odo or a well treated one.  Im not keen on the single? cylinder cbrs of late as they seem pretty boring and sound average.

7490586,0,t3_4hzb79,Legally speaking Im not sure where you stand here.I just checked the Melbourne Airport website and found this page which statesgt Motorcycles are not permitted to park on any footpaths walkways or infront of entryexit doors. Motorcycles that are parked illegally will receive an infringement notice and may be towed. If you are unsure of where to park upon your arrival please speak to a car park attendant who will point you in the right direction.So its definitely part of Melb Airports rulesregulationswhatever you wanna call them that you cant park on sidewalks.But if theres no signage around I dont see how people are meant to know that you cant do it  pretty much every other place in Melbourne with a few exceptions you can park on the sidewalk so places that you cant park at should be clearly marked to indicate as such.You could try taking it to court and fight it on the grounds that they dont make it obvious enough but the chance of winning it is probably very slim especially considering this is Melbourne Airport were talking about and as they already told you it would be considered a federal matter not state.Id say your best bet is to try and scrape together the money and pay the fine  its not the ideal thing but at least then its over and done with.If you have any problems getting the money together to pay it by the due date just PM me and Ill help ya out.,melbourneriders,d2tn0ke,9,t5_3332h

10173199,0,t3_5ljgfb,Ive had  dirt bikes but only ever  road bike. And the road bike was a little KTM Duke so probably doesnt count.  dirt bikes fit easy though. Just remember to use tie downs and just secures them lightly to begin with. Only tighten down once you have both bikes on starting with the inside tie downs first. Probably use a towel between any parts of the bikes that are touching. Remember to tie down the rear wheels as well to stop them bouncing and shifting the bikes. And try having  people as its hard as fuck for heavier bikes with just one. ,melbourneriders,dbx6sbg,1,t5_3332h
