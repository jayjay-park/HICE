484696,0,t3_1wgzh7,Jesus on more that one occasion get information wrong in the bible and even fails to perform a miracle in one story. If Hes God why is he messing this stuff up? Jesus never got stuff wrong in the bible. Humanity has always mistranslated his words. The Church does its best to retain those accuracies of his original teachings. This helped me understand the trinity as an atheistAlso remember Jews dont get their own law from the Torah hence we dont get our law from The Holy Bible. We get our law from the Catechisms. Which I would urge you read again  ,catechism,cfvd3a3,1,t5_2rtvz
