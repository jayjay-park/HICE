10081297,0,t1_dbjuhm8,Thank you for your answers. I also saw you have work abroad offered in Korea as well. Is it at all possible to work there without a formal bachelors from a university?I as well as many other sane fiscally responsible Americans can concur that it is quite unlikely to obtain a  year degree in  years in the states without going into a massive amount of credit debt with little to no promise of a career with rising cost of living and more government corruption and insolvency across several institutions including education here itself. Sanity in governance affairs has gone cold here.What is the best and quickest way to obtain a bachelors without massive debt obligations? What type of degree program would you recommend?,IWantOutJobs,dblm2ow,1,t5_2u88t
