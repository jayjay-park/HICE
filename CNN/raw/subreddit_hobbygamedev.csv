617033,0,t1_cga24xb,I dont have experience with any D engine and all my D stuff has been OpenGL directly simple things I wouldnt say I wrote an engine I dont have a proper GPU to do it anyway.Im not a big fan of C myself perhaps because of that Ive never tried SFML Ive used old SDL . though and I tried the new . just before it was released.If I finally try OgreD I will share my findings! If youre into Python Panda D looks great but again... I havent tried it.,hobbygamedev,cgaeouy,1,t5_2uahj

1517281,0,t3_2bbff9,Maybe the question should have been Can you achieve success with Decent  mediocre graphics and awesome gameplay?  You have all given excellent advice.  I am working on a game called Meteor Fury and while I consider myself a decent software developer my graphics skills are as useless as tits on a bull.  I am flying solo on this little project of mine and hiring someone to do the graphics is completely out of the question.  It will be an interesting ride to say the least.  Thank you all again!,hobbygamedev,cj6gus9,1,t5_2uahj
1686337,0,t3_2d2ztj,To answer the subject question Not really. I think both negative and positive thoughts are fairly bogus  they both run off confirmation bias simply cherry picking the evidence that confirms the belief the person already has.I plan something I think I can do in twenty minutes then set the timer and try and do it. If I can I know I can do it not from belief but because I just did it in X time.When I know I can do X Y and Z etc in a certain time I know I can combine them like notes are combined in a song and an idea of how long thatll take in RL.It took me awhile to get here.,hobbygamedev,cjrq6uv,1,t5_2uahj
2171979,0,t1_clcx5hm,It amazes me that still nothing beats a small sturdy notebook and a good pencil. After buying an iPad I really tried hard to replace them but reverted back to notebook after a couple of weeks.,hobbygamedev,clfwrqr,2,t5_2uahj
2172625,0,t1_clfu6py,This is exactly what I have just figured out.  It has completely morphed into something else but the original idea is still the foundation.,hobbygamedev,clfzqki,1,t5_2uahj
2990207,0,t1_co521yt,Okay so yours was also a competition then?  We didnt have anything like that.  Just make your game post it online and then give a demonstration of it at the end.  We even also got a free Tshirt!    Good job it wasnt a competition for us though or wed have probably lost since we didnt really finish and there were some really nicely polished d games from people whod been before I guess and knew what they were doing!,hobbygamedev,co7xktp,2,t5_2uahj
3285254,0,t3_2xq2k8,So what does this mean for us?Any comments from Unity users? Which better suits for small scale projects?,hobbygamedev,cp2que4,2,t5_2uahj
4224750,0,t1_cs1lty4,Yep. Its in my subreddit flair here may not show on mobile etc?. I suppose especially in this case itll be relevant for me to make that more evident in the post. Will edit it in. Thanks!,hobbygamedev,cs1ssov,1,t5_2uahj
4588850,0,t3_3d631d,Wow...thats a very unique and intriguing idea and you put a lot of nice work into it.Out of curiosity what led you to use filesfolders as the main representation of the simulation?,hobbygamedev,ct90s4a,2,t5_2uahj
