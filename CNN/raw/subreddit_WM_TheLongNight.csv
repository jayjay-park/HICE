11071170,0,t3_5wuegu,Another resource that I use for my roll games are monster macros to help speed up the combat basically creating a template which you can copypaste monsters into so you can easily act on their turns.Im probably not explaining it all too well but this is the video that I used and I can safely say that ive been using this style ever since.As said ive been using it for a little bit now so I can help out if you guys need it but the video explains everything really well and setting up the templates BEFORE you actually make the monsters allows you to basically do this for any e monster! even their MM and Volos monsters are integrated,WM_TheLongNight,demwnkj,1,t5_3j3wx
