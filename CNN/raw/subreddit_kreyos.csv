1697010,0,t1_cjgkovi,Glad I got my refund. I had a feeling the promise of wp support was bs. Especially since they refused to post dev videos with the platform and instead only had IOS and android.From what I see only Siri works anyway. Dont need a kreos for that....,kreyos,cjt2kvi,1,t5_2xred
1733107,0,t1_cjxerth,that was my other choice when I both the kreyos back in...feburary or march or something. This was supposed to be out by then. I dont know. I think we might end up having to wait until microsoft releases something but end up paying like  for it.,kreyos,cjxmfad,1,t5_2xred
1735546,0,t1_cjxvvs0,I think the biggest clusterfuck from this mess is the complete lack of meaningful communication.  The watch is in peoples hands so theres no reason for secrecy anymore.  We know what doesnt work first hand.They should be updating their blog by identifying the known major issues the causes and whats being done about them.So far Ive only seen them address the waterproofing issue shipping errors with watchbands some upcoming app improvements and how Steve doesnt own a Ferrari and hes going to tell us where all the money went.If they can post about said issues in some obscure forum thread they had time to post about it on their blog.,kreyos,cjxxhj4,2,t5_2xred
