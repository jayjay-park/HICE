I appreciate the list of talking points and I have to say that the last one about colorado surprised me. So much so that I did go to their website to see what that was about. Now the Moderator has to read one of my lengthier comments.Also a person asked where SAM gets its money on their site and one of their people responded that it was small donations and volunteer work. I dont buy it because like you said they seem well funded and organized.

564599,0,t3_20kmzs,They shouldnt be losing their jobs in the first place. We need to establish guidelines for acceptable use because there is TONS of anecdotal evidence to support the notion that highly productive people can consume cannabis offand in some cases onthe job without compromising their workplace value. I know this to be true for me and many others and we need to open federal grant funding to cannabis researchers in the US to prove some of these critical points! Im not intimately familiar with the individual circumstances of these two but they seem to be upstanding citizens who deserve to be treated as such. At the very least they should receive unemployment benefits.And even that is not a longterm solution. Companies cannot support terminated employees indefinitely and where are these poor souls going to find a job now? I doubt their employers are going to be recommending rehire of these people to other employers...This is a democracy and we have voted that responsible and especially medical marijuana use is legal.

719856,0,t3_22e2e1,hello!vaporizers are a great way to curb the harshness from smoking you might get from taking a huge bong rip or puffing on joints but where to start when embarking on such a purchase you may ask?well...how would you like to use it? portable? or plugged in?portable vaporizers are nice but pretty pricey they usually still need to be charged or replace batteries plugged in models can get expensive too but they can last a while remember it is an investment.There are some like vapor daddy these are nice for beginners they have a dial that can adjust the heat depending on how much you want to spend you can get some that have a way to set the temp. you wish to vaporize your herbs at. the downside is that you must inhale the heat of it aswell. if you want to just buy one and done you cant go wrong with one like a volcano.they are expensive  plus? but it will vaporize the herbs at a designated temperature and it will let you know when its warmed up to your desired settings. they also use a fan to fill up a bag that is full of vapor. then you can turn the device off and just puff from the bag. It conserves flowers fairly well and can usually vaporize hash like substances. anyone ive met who has bought one usually has a good experience with a model like it even if it isnt an actual volcano there are clones of them out on the market probably half the price with the same kind of effect. if i were you i would save up and invest in a good device that will last you a whilehope this helps message me if you would like to talk more  to the moon!!!!!,Marijuana,cgm3naa,1,t5_2qhhn

Not necessarily from anecdotal experience but based on the articles reasoningor lack there of and how they got to their conclusion? Nothing in the article I feel supports the headline and theres quite a few flaws here.The author seems to basically argue over semantics of the word temperament claiming that the authors of the study called it positive and negative emotionality but this guyor girl? seems to claim and why I cannot see that what it actually means is stress and anxiety. Whatever you wish to define as temperament heavy users have less desirable results according to the test as I understand it.I did not read the original study or at least I forgot it if I did but I can only imagine there was more to it than this article is focusing on which is an answer to two separate questions and that is it. Heshe also comes across a little sensationalist by as I read it almost implying the main effects of taking ritalin are increased anxiety and irritability.He claimsgt What was measured by the study was a decreased response to methylphenidate in regular cannabis users.then later says gt If anything the results of administering a potent stimulant which increases anxiety and irritability showed that cannabis users are less prone to both.Sure it can increase stress and anxiety thats definitely an effect of methylphenidate but Im assuming they didnt test these people by giving them uncomfortable doses of it and that most had a rather typical experience so why would you conclude it measures anxiety and irritability? Most people healthy or not on a proper dose of methylphenidate will likely feel less anxiety or at least less negative anxiety. You might feel excitement that is but youll have less social anxiety more confidence and drive to do things etc. He does seem to pick out some legitimate flaws in the study though as well that are worth looking into and questioning. There is a conflict of interest on those that commissioned the study and while the results are still in favor of nonuse there was a single control or two as I saw it that swayed the numbers much more significantly making the study less accurate.,Marijuana,cmjr3o3,2,t5_2qhhn

5732979,0,t1_cx6ydez,His passion has always attracted people but hes not the best communicator. Ive interviewed him several times and as a heavy head myself attribute that to accelerated stoner thought process some of the time.What hes trying to get at but not conveying in this piece is that overregulated legalization isnt legalization if multiple jurisdictions treat pot differently from any other consumer product.Hes wrong on several fronts not the least of which is that its particularly habit forming as with alcohol gambling and other vices. Societies have generally allowed jurisdictions to accomodate social pressures caused by vice minimal as they often really are via tax and leaders have often  as he suggests  instead used those powers for fundraising or as a bully pulpit.But theres a balance to be had. This is a very populist issue and if Trudeau et al play this too politically or too slowly in adopting best practises from other jurisdictions the public backlash will be considerable. For one mail order and medical dispensaries that are unlicensed are popping up all over the country. People are already tacitly treating it as legal to the degree that crackdownlevel enforcement of either business restriction or againt public consumption is likely to cause a major public outcry against a government that campaigned on knowing better and that has been in the political wilderness for years.,Marijuana,cx7qd27,1,t5_2qhhn

Of course use it in moderate amount as has already been noted trust your nervous system breathe and just relax with it. You may be experiencing a purgation. Set aside a time for solitude and sit with it you will be fine.  ,Marijuana,czoocmp,1,t5_2qhhn

7681649,0,t1_d3faeav,I am a small time grower. I know what photoperiods are and I suspect that your assertion that the short growing season makes it easier to harvest is based on turnover but not bud quality or variety. Ok on the water shortages and prairies. I definitely think Canada grows some great indoor in general so no arguments there. Electricity cost? Ok. Organizational arguments? I can appreciate the lack of bureaucracy so that is cool. I was smoking BC beasters buds  years ago back in high school when that was THE definition of  commercial indoor so I definitely believe in Canadian indoor given I have since smoked much better Canadian product than that and beasters was never really that bad. I am not convinced on Canadian outdoor. Especially plants that need more full spectrum of light with higher intensity than you will get at  degN. Maybe in southern Ontario but not elsewhere without supplemental lighting. The Sativa outs I get samples of from Oregon arent great so I wonder how going even further north will be. Maybe this is just my ignorance of Canadian bud. Greenhouses are another deal but I am really just talking about outs grown under the sun without additional structure.

8049367,0,t1_d4jrcn8,Heres the thing.  The industry is very lucrative similar to the tech start up industry. Theres a ton of money in the cannabis industry at the moment and the shops are making significant money.  If you draw a parallel between a tech start up and the cannabis industry youve got your front office workers and back office workers.  The front of house people i.e. assistants account managers ops people help the business run.  And in those instances in the cannabis industry those people are paid hourly.  Thats not great but its not bad.  However you then have the back of house staff CEO Head of Sales COO etc.  Those people in business make a lot of money.  In the cannabis industry unless you are the owner of the company your Head of Sales who might have  years experience would be paid a very minimal salary like k.  Where in the tech industry those same positions are making x that in base salary alone.  Therefore whats the point in going into the cannabis industry if youre going to be paid pennies on the dollar vs another industry?

The next day you were mentally expecting   to get the same effects however because you just had an incredible experience it is unlikely you will reach the  same level the next day. To put it another way if you drove a Lamborghini on consecutive days in a row it wouldnt  feel as great as the first time. Ive been studying and experimenting with vaporizing Marijuana for some time now and  Ive learned that to get the best effects you need to use cannabis in moderation once or twice a week. NEVER two  days in a row. Your body needs to know what sober is like before it can enjoy being high again. You need on and off.  This goes for everything in life. Caffeine and Cannabis always mix well for me because I take a break from both for a   week and then schedule a day when I will blast off into other dimensions with cannabis and earl grey tea or coffee.,Marijuana,d9f3j7t,2,t5_2qhhn

So lets go off of mendo county and only have  plants you get k minus k for a worker k to process and  for supplies. That leaves you k for the year.

People have one hitter bowls for their bongs while others pack fat bowls and arent overly worried about excess burn. Personally i put out the bowl between bong rips to limit the burn.
