1200264,0,t1_chu2xy4,Maybe not related to kava in particular... I drank maybe  cups in one night felt really nauseated and sick after. One week after the nausea came back with some appetite loss. After that I developed jaundice dark urine and almost white stool. Went to a doctor who took some blood tests my asat alat and bilirubine are very high. I got hospitalized for further tests and ultrasound. They are not sure why my liver has such high values its not an inflammation according to them. The doctor just used hus hands to see if it was enlarged which it was not though the liver is almost completely covered by the ribs. Im not trying to scare anyone if you do get nausea loss of appetite and a general feeling if sickness then darker urine and white stool go see a doctor. It could just be hepatitis but its very rare here. It could however be some other type of virus which indirectly affects the liver and gallbladder. ,Kava,ci4nca2,1,t5_2te5i

5470284,0,t3_3pq0c8,Oh goodness. Youll honestly be saving money by just buying kava powder. Yeah its kinda pricey up front but its a luxury. You could probably get the same effects from  shells of kava that you would get from a box of yogi tea.

6215410,0,t3_3zlurp,Here is what I personally do. tablespoons of powder go into a blender. A cup of milk and a cup of water are heated until somewhat hot then go into the blender as well. I blend it for  minutes then use a metal strainer like this to do a rough filtering. I then use cheesecloth to do the fine filtering chill it and try not to smell it when I drink it.To get the most out of your powder when I strain with the metal strainer I knock the root sludge into the cheesecloth and give it a good squeeze lots of kavalactones in there. I will keep some orange juice on hand as a chaser as well and some crystallized ginger to nibble on if my stomach protests.Youve probably tried it already but regardless best of luck to ya.,Kava,cyw4is1,2,t5_2te5i

7210066,0,t3_4e5knl,AFAIK you cannot legally import the stuff in commercial volumes. Importing small amounts for personal use is also not allowed but they arent strict about this and most people have no trouble buying kava online and having it shipped to the UK. Just go into it with the expectation that sometimes a purchase wont get through the net and youre less likely to be too disappointed.  EDIT        ,Kava,d1xq80u,2,t5_2te5i
7262838,0,t3_4eva9n,Not too long ago the name for that was simply instant kava and you could find it quickly by searching.

Ive probably tried more kava types from more vendors than anyone youll talk to. Bula Kava House has very consistent products and they have very high quality controls that very few other vendors have. As another poster pointed out Gourmet Hawaiian Kava is pretty good but I just havent found their products to be consistently potent enough for my liking.I made a top ten list of my favorite kavas. ,Kava,d2k38wl,2,t5_2te5i
7550402,0,t1_d30b6sp,gt I mix both heavily every day as so many other people throughout the kava community  As far as I can tell from kavaforums.com the worlds largest online community of kava drinkers Kava lovers generally dislike kratom and want no association with it. The only reason for the association is that kava being generally considered safe is often used as a cover for kratom vendors... you see this a lot in Florida where most kava bars are really kratom bars.  Public perception of kava is also damaged by this association with kratom. See this shitty Dr. Phil episode for example where kava and vaping both innocuous and safe are tarred with the same brush as kratom aderall and alcohol.  Some believe that kratom being an addictive substance that occasionally destroys lives will eventually be banned in the US. There is a fear in the kava community that if this happens kava could also be caught up in the net.  ,Kava,d30g0dd,3,t5_2te5i

8236553,0,t1_d573m3b,Ok well could I persuade you to selling me or connecting with your supply haha? Yeah I like the stuff on the left its got some different effect than the darker one I am currently trying. Its a noticably difference in taste and feel. The yellow sample made my mouth numb when I took it the other didnt. The browned stuff is definitely more heady kind of a drunk feeling which is typical of tudei spiked kava? Im guessing it want harm to use the darker on occasion? I dont use kava everyday but Im cautious to using the wrong kind. Cant thank you enough for all the advice and oversight. If you hear of a good bulk deal on a trusted noble vendor please keep me in mind.,Kava,d574hup,1,t5_2te5i
8459914,0,t1_d5uzow3,I think the Aluball was causing the extreme nausea. I have a very sensitive stomach and have nausea enough as it is not diagnosed yet so not sure why I have it all the time now. I made Kava again from the Aluball and then filtered it through a Kava strainer. What remained was a ton of mud. So I had apparently drank that before which may have been bad. Drinking it after filtering made it taste much cleaner and it gave me no additional nausea.Today I made about oz of Kava from  tablespoons of Loa Waka. This time I did it the good way. Kneaded it by hand for about  minutes. Excited to see the results of this. The liquid is much much more chocolatylooking than what the Aluball makes. I even strained it twice just to be sure nothing got through.,Kava,d5z0vz1,1,t5_2te5i

8516578,0,t3_4wdh3u,This particualar product is quite controversial. According to numerous acetone test results it contains tudei kava i.e. the traditionally avoided undesirable but cheap to produce kava which is known for its potential to cause extended nausea next day hangover lethargy etc. The owner of BKH claims this kava is the only example in the world of a product failing the acetone test that is still drinkablenoble but others remain skeptical. I would personally recommend against drinking it as theres no need to gamble if you can easily purchase many other unquestionably noble and good kavas including some of the other products sold by BKH.

8907371,0,t1_d7i91lz,Thanks for the suggestion. Ive heard great things about it but it only makes enough for a single person and we dont drink kava that way in the Pacific Islands.  Add to that the fact itd cost me almost  when you add in shipping to Fiji and I just cant justify spending money on it.,Kava,d7ijc3r,1,t5_2te5i
8912457,0,t3_52c4qs,gt I also hear its much stronger  AFAIK there is no reason to believe that micronised kava as sold by most vendors is any stronger than traditionalmedium grind kava. After all they just take the latter and grind it down some more to get the former. The exception would be vendors that remove the hard inner root fibres aka makas that contain lower amounts of kavalactones before they micronise their kava. Even so I dont believe the difference would be significant.  IMO the only way youd get a more potent kava from micronised would be if you werent doing a very good job kneading your traditional grind.  gt Looking for an answer from an expert or someone close to it.  I know quite a bit about kava including how it is produced but have never personally consumed it in micronised form. ,Kava,d7j5axr,1,t5_2te5i
8976579,0,t1_d7q8kh2,Well I take g at a time just g in a day. If I did  at once I would consider that pretty high. Lol Thanks I appreciate it! Yeah its really messed up what they are doing. Land of the free my ass. It should be treated the way kava is. For kratom I just add drink then dump the dose in my mouth and swallow it which is painless. I have the instant kava now so Ill just do it the quick way but I will definitely check out that bottle. Im sure Ill get into micronized and medium as well eventually. ,Kava,d7quk9g,2,t5_2te5i

It is such a useful plant and completely fucked up and uneducated that they decided to rush it into Schedule I.

10317472,0,t1_dcdhkzf,Im not disagreeing with you at all really I too understand and suspected verifying the sources of quality Kava would be challenging and I do not know their sources in Vanuatu. Ive read that post you linked and others similar and apparently around  Mountain Rose Herb claimed their Kava was a blend including Borugu and two others which I cannot recall and then as of recent it says its just Borugu . This was after someone supposedly messaged them in regards to there supposedly being  tudei in their Kava at the time so I do believe they changed their sources at least at that time. Ive not messaged them in regards to the quality of it recently but if they are buying it legally from Vanuatu then it has to be organically grown noble varieties according to export law and again theyre not just a company out looking to make a cheap buck so I doubt they are purposely doing anything illegal. I can say my batch is from December  and it doesnt cause any tudei like effects and has a balanced body and head high. I thought about doing an acetone test but I doubt it would show any tudei coloring.,Kava,dcdji15,2,t5_2te5i

10380678,0,t1_dckj162,thanks  yes I have read the post  and it brings up several key points.  Since I have a reliable supply of noble kava  my main concern was losing compounds due to incorrect solvent.  And capsules are a possibility however the ingestion of the kava drink produces nausea and I assume once the capsules dissolve internally they would to  while in an extract the primary substance would be kavalactones  which I imagine would cut down on the nausea.  So if I wanted to make capsules I could just use prepared  dried and powdered root  and empty caps? ,Kava,dckppsu,1,t5_2te5i
