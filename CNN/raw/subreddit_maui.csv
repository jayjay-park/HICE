2246310,0,t3_2kwhr9,Yeah pretty spoton with your assessment. Ive lived in both places both have pros and cons. There are beaches innear Paia Baldwin Paia Bay Hookipa. They wont be as calm as the ones in KiheiWailea in January but youll probably be able to see some highclass surfing and windsurfing. You can swimrelax at Baldwin but if youre looking to spend hours on a softsand calmwater beach every day the WaileaMakena beaches are better for that.If youre right in Paia you can walk to everything in town. Its real small. There are  places to eat all decent to great plus an incredible little organichippy grocery store right there. Kihei has Safeway and McDonalds but it also has some decent restaurants and its like  times the size of Paia so more options.If youre going to drive to Hana or up the volcano Paia is a better base for that. Will save you  minutes each way. Paia may get rain some of the days and be sunny and super nice others Kihei will probably be sunny and dryer. But you know theyre only about  minutes apart by car not a huge deal to drive down to Big Beach in Makena or over to Lahaina to do some beaching if its wet up north.Oh there will be whales in January mostly off the Kihei amp Lahaina beaches.

Red Cross open up shelters and had something like  to  people using those shelters.This was not a minor delay. Sadly it was also not uncommon. Seems like a fire or accident shuts it down regularly. Last peak tourist season was causing the regular commute to take  hours. Nobody builds that extra time in to the day and its directly impacting livability for people on the island. Businesses and individuals are adjusting  I dont think its unintentional that Maui Brewing moved to Kihei. As to other options thats the hard part that should be started now.

9327256,0,t1_d8vcmqf,A few reasons  there are height restrictions in many neighborhoods so it limits the development of  certain buildings. Also it definitely is form following function. You also want to maximize shade on windows while allowing for rain to be deflected. An overhang along the entire roof helps shade the windows and allows rain to run off. The tallest point runs within the interior of the house allowing for the heat to rise.  Its also cheaper to build a design in that local contractors are familiar with and doesnt require pricey  special orders that might take months to arrive. Modern houses with sheets of glass are more  cause you gotta ship that glass tint it and get custom made curtains. Even with tint its often too bright. And pricey metal framing around large panes of glass tends to corrode rapidly. The rainwind also tends to make the exteriors grimy thats why s many houses are sort of dirt colored. Many of the homes are vacation rentals so keeping maintenance  down is important. ,maui,d8yaqu6,2,t5_2rcb6

While theyre giving us the pregame speech in the parking lot they drop that one of the two impellers propellers? is on the fritz.  But everything will be fine and that just means well have more time to spot whales.Uh ok.We pays our moneys get on the boat and were slowly making our way to Molokini and the engine dies.  Capt gets it restarted and we continue on our way.   mins later it dies again.  Takes a couple minutes but capt gets it started again.  Turns the boat around and takes us back in.  I guess the second engine was having issues too and they thought they could cheese a trip or two out of it before fixing the issues.So  going back was smart and the safetyconscious thing to do.  Props to the capt for that.  Setting out in a fuct boat in the first place not cool.  Especially considering the last month has seen weeks on end of downtime for maintenance I dont understand how a boat in this biz cant be in tiptop shape for the slamming holiday season.They refunded the  and we went down to Big Beach and snorkeled off the south end.  Not bad and my visiting fam from the Mainland were good sports about it.  Still we wont get the chance to do that trip again so Im disappointed it played out like that.So  for the now anyway DONT book with Seafire.  I hope theyll get their act together and be back in business soon.  They seemed like nice people.,maui,dbli4ba,1,t5_2rcb6

10310584,0,t1_dcbwsa4,Ha!  Just looking at your list I suspected your group were seafood fans.  Overall Maui is a big vegetarian paradise but Paia in particular.  Mana foods is kind of the grand daddy of that movement.  But theres also a Wholefoods there.Youre young so some of our cultural sites are kind of touristy and cheesy so if youre not into that sort of stuff please dont go.  But for the record.  Haleakala  Be sure to go to the ranger station.Hana  The cultural center.Ulupalakua Ranch  The actual ranch and winery.Whaliers Village  Theres a museum there.Old Town Lahina  Just walk around there and youll see some historical sites etc.  The Wing HO Temple  in Lahina.Oh!  I didnt see snorkling in your itinerary. Rent some masks and go snorkling at La Perouse ,maui,dccreab,1,t5_2rcb6
10320479,0,t1_dcdu6tz,You should also be able to access Koki Beach from there. Aside from Homoa and Koki Beaches I believe the only other beaches in Hana itself are Red Sands and Hana Bay? And the others on the way from the main Road to Hana road not the route I listed above include Waianapanapa State Park Black Sand Beach and Honomanu Bay. Hopefully someone can confirm if I am missing any beaches in Hana as well as on the Road to Hana. ,maui,dcdvspg,2,t5_2rcb6
10377691,0,t1_dckc0dg,The brown and yuck is for the part close to shore. What you describe is for the part of the reef further out which is where all the snorkel boats go.Even there though the reef is overfished and had really bad bleaching the last few years I was just snorkeling there this last weekend. Make sure you use reef safe sunscreen!,maui,dckdigf,5,t5_2rcb6
