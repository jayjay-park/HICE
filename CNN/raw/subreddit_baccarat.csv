5363716,0,t1_cvtny2q,The thing about this game that kind of tricks people into playing is the simplicity of it all. Simple game of heads or tails.  The problem with heads or tails is that we dont have money placed on each outcome and because of that no emotional investment.With that being said there is no strategy that I can recommend for YOU to play there is no one shoe fits all solution.  What I can recommend is to keep these things in mind when going about finding tweaking and developing a strategy for your own personal use. Would you consider yourself as a person who is generally impatient or patient? If you are impatient you may want a strategy where the unit size bet is fairly large to make winning faster.  If you are patient you would be fine either flat betting or going for a more conservative approach in unit size   unit bets. Are you fairly disciplined? If you set in your head an amount to win can you count on yourself to get up and LEAVE the casino when you reach this amount? What is your starting Bankroll? Do you have enough money to last through the downswings of the shoe? Are you constantly on tilt? I personally recommend having a bankroll of  units.  This means if your minimum bet is  you need at least  to play comfortably. Of course if you are just playing for fun all of this does not matter but if you want to win over the long term so to say you have to keep these things in mind.  Last but not least PRACTICE!,baccarat,cvx9x83,1,t5_2z9lt
