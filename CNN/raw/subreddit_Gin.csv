411678,0,t3_1wdhpe,I love the unique qualities of gin but this is why I rarely touch it. I am capable of drinking a significant amount of whisky and vodka despise tequila but last time I started a night off with three GampTs I ended up having to lay down for several hours because I felt this wave of headache and exhaustion overtake me.And that was Tanqueray not swill so Im not sure if any gins are safe for me.,Gin,cfnfq4m,1,t5_2qmhp
1262150,0,t1_cibkhuq,It is one of my alltime favourites and though it does tend to put a hole in your pocket and halfway through your shoes its well worth it. Love it straight up or on ice and theres not a lot of gins that I would say that about. Heres hoping they dont fuck with it.,Gin,ciblvtr,1,t5_2qmhp

4438701,0,t3_3bu3r9,As a huge Tanqueray fan Id like to suggest you give a try mixing it with seltzer. Add a dash of lime or lime juice. I love gin and feel that tonic can sometimes overpower the taste of the liquor.  Seltzer offers a nice mix but keeps it very gin tasting. Nothing wrong with a GampT though!  Just trying to recruit more ppl to my gin and soda army lol.,Gin,csq6lnp,2,t5_2qmhp

7653330,0,t1_d3bksdl,You should probably specify not to shake the club soda when you say to shake everything. Good recipe though ,Gin,d3c52ym,4,t5_2qmhp
7737969,0,t3_4l88ih,So its going to be tough to find a gin in that price range unless its some sort of special batch. For an unaged product like gin prices just dont get up too high. Id suggest Tanqueray Malacca if you can find it and it may be up in that price range or Aviation for a similar taste profile. Maybe Ransom Old Tom for something special which d run you like ish?,Gin,d3lr1e9,2,t5_2qmhp

10809096,0,t1_dduovzo,Similarily I think monkey  is overrated. Its too inconsistent. Every batch is different and I dont think that its really all that great of a product. I know a couple of other gins like it tastewise that I would more gladly buy since I know what I get. Gin mare on the other hand is in my hall of fame. Makes a really nice and dry Ginamptonic when mixed with fever tree med. and a twig of rosemary and an olive as garnish.,Gin,dduvrd0,1,t5_2qmhp
