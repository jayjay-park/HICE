1956983,0,t3_2gk7ef,Guarding reality is BORING. Like really really boring. Youre talking about something thats been around for long enough for humans to invent cruise ships. So yeah even if Pokmon are doing our homework from us that has got to thousands of years.Making stuff is only really entertaining because its challenging time consuming and develops a skill. Someone with the power to instantly create or destroy whatever they can imagine would be bored silly with it. Theres a similar problem with just destroying besides when you can bring back whatever you destroy with little effort its not like it means all that much.Playing the servant and sticking to an arbitrary set of rules is a game. People do it all the time particularly people who have a lot of power otherwise. Its also what a lot of other Pokmon do so it provides a lot of insight into the kind of lives they lead and the challenges they face. That kind of perspective is valuable for people in charge and rather easy to lose touch with.Theres also the whole friendship best buddy forever thing. Not for everyone but it can mean a great deal to someone who feels lonely or disconnected from the experiences of others.Long story short Its something to do that might be a refreshing change of pace that helps reconnect ancient being of doom with what is going on in the world also street cred if Pokmon care about that sort of thing.,CMVLikeIAmA,ckp0pcm,12,t5_316hc
