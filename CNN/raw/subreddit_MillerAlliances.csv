221428,0,t3_1wnd7j,I understand what you mean but the only point Id contest here is the meeting tonight That needs to happen. If everyone from every faction knew the objective well in advance then people would play for the objective BEFORE the event starts and that ruins it.We need to choose the objective in a majority vote literally just before the event. And I like the idea of having  objectives to choose from in advance so each of our respective alliances can choose between themselves what theyd vote for then vote  minutes before the event so we know what to choose.,MillerAlliances,cf3nzmj,1,t5_2zs3f
