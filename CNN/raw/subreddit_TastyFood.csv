7481906,0,t3_4hvi20,RecipeMakes two large stuffed peppersYoull need Olive Oil  large Anaheim Peppers  large Green Pepper diced  large Red Onion diced  a Garlic clove minced  breakfast sausage links cut into small pieces about the size of a peanut MampM Cream cheese roughly a halfcup Cilantro fresh leaves chopped  about  to  cup depending on taste A few pieces of dry toast Sriracha Sauce or comparable Bacon for wrapping I use two pieces per large pepper Some toothpicks for the wrap. Put about a teaspoon olive oil in a pan set to medium heat. Let that get hot.. Add diced green peppers and onions. Sautee there for about  minutes stirring occasionally. After  minutes add sausage and garlic. Let sausage brown stirring mixture occasionally. Turn off heat leave the pan over the stillhot stove. Add cream cheese and let that sort of melt around everything. Youll need to mix this mixture about quite a bit to get the cream cheese to properly mix everywhere. . If youre baking preheat the oven to . If youre barbequeing you want the fire started like fifteen minutes ago at least.. In a separate bowl combine dry toast break it up into pieces about the same size as the sausage it helps to have the toast fairly welldone but not blackened cilantro and squirt some sriracha all over that. Only needs about  teaspooons. . Add the sausageonionpeppercream cheese mixture to the bowl of toastcilantrosriracha. Mix that all together. . Open your anaheim peppers by cutting a small slice off lengthwise. Unless you really really like spicy you should be careful to remove all the seeds from the pepper. Dig that stuff out I even spray the interior with water to make sure. Stuff the peppers with the mixture as tight as you can in all the nooks and crannies. It may seem like it wont all fit but it will anyway. . Stick a few toothpicks along the pepper and wrap your bacon around the peppers. If baking set on a metal pan and throw it in for  minutes. If barbequeing throw on the grill for the same amount of time. . Towards the last minute or so Ill set the oven to broil . This crisps up the bacon wrap a bit but also causes the bacon grease to begin smoking. Your smoke alarm may go off even if you cant see that much smoke. Happenes to me every time. Enjoy. These things are like heaven. ,TastyFood,d2snfqq,2,t5_33df0
