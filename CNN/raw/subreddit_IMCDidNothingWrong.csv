10122412,0,t1_dbpqi3d,Youre delusional.You think that humanity can only exist in the Solar system is that it? Life has flourished on the Frontier without the watchful eye of the IMC and the Solar government and all of this disorder and chaos only spawned from the IMCs need to obliterate millions of hours worth of peoples lives. They value the importance of the Core worlds far more than they do the denizens of the frontier. Why? Because theyve been around longer than everybody else so why should the youths get a chance?Yeah! Lets prioritise the lives of all the old people of the world moreso than the children!,IMCDidNothingWrong,dbqygur,1,t5_3h7xd
