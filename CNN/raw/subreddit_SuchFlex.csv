You could try and restart the app and see if anything different happens in the GPU section when you switch it on.  We will be releasing updates to improve compatibility and errorchecking soon.  Send us a message or respond here to let us know how things go!,SuchFlex,d3sinao,1,t5_3eodz

7933578,0,t1_d46jzxb,thoughts on new logo? www.suchflex.comhere are some variations,SuchFlex,d47t4n4,1,t5_3eodz
8943600,0,t1_d7mvr6r,well based on the past we can see that tSuchFlex certainly does have the capabilities to continue to monitor the miners despite the earnings not being updated. And here we are again where the earnings arent being updated so at least on the surface this situation is similar to what has happened in the past.  Hmm I guess Im just being optimistic,SuchFlex,d7mw0m2,2,t5_3eodz

9406389,0,t1_d96jl6j,The storage sharing platform that SuchFlex uses Storj has blacklist system and Storj automatically adapts when your connection is dropped.It means that youll lose your client if you if your uptime isnt enough.It has been long time since I read about Storj but it still should work pretty closely to this way.,SuchFlex,d98bqfz,1,t5_3eodz
9473384,0,t3_56dy1v,HiWhen I updated to the latest version of SuchFlex two days ago I started getting an issue where if I was running all the sections and then left my computer for a few minutes it would black screen and I would need to reboot to fix the problem this has stopped me from using suchflex properly.,SuchFlex,d9gss4e,1,t5_3eodz
9579876,0,t1_d9tw6gt,Huh now its doing something. Stratum Creating DAG done. Funny that sometimes the manual override seems to work with command like  or  and now its just  or .
