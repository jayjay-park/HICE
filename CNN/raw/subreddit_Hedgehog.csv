466103,0,t3_1zfdxn,Theres no training involved. Put a tray under the wheel. It catches the runoff and they start to associate that area with the smell so theyll mostly go there even when not running. Corner litter trays are wasted space. Remember that they wont hold it like a dog so theyll still go outside the cage when they need to. Start handling with a foot bath for  minutes to get it out of their system. Also babies are messy and will poop a lot more indiscriminately its something they grow out of.,Hedgehog,cft8x3y,1,t5_2rvox

From how you described it I think you transitioned the food well so as long as hes eating you should be fine. Just carefully measure it out and keep a close eye on it maybe stay up a but later than normal and listen to activity.Edit if you play with him around midnight or am for about  minutes to an hour it should make him awake and hungry.,Hedgehog,cncv232,1,t5_2rvox

4498243,0,t3_3cp9e6,I would say no. One of the biggest reasons is that hedgehogs need a heat source to keep their cage at a constant warm temperature. If you stop with the hedgehog in your car what would you do with it? Also I am not sure how constant travel would affect a hog but my guess would be not well. My hedgehog is ok with  hourish rides up to my familys cottage but more than that she gets antsy shes in smaller cage for travel I dont know how a big cage would do in the event of a minor collision or something Not sure if hotels would like having hedgehog guests and youd have to check all of the places you travel to allow hedgehogs I believe there are some statesmunicipalities that dont allow them but Im Canadian so dont quote meTheres probably more reasons but those would be more than enough to dissuade me if I were in your position. ,Hedgehog,csxnq6r,8,t5_2rvox

A teadrop shape viewed from above is the ideal and they basically should be built like potatoes. A natural healthy roundness can be exaggerated by various positions you might see in photos to look chubby. An actual overweight hedgehog will have obvious extra fatty deposits at the edge of the quill line and at the tops of the legs and in extreme cases will not be able to fully ball up. Some people will simply it to state that their ability to ball up is the test of whether theyre overweight but hedgehogs that are only moderately overweight will usually still be able to go into a tight ball. Also sometimes vet will go by outdated sources that specific a small range of the normal adult weight for hedgehogs and any hedgehog over that weight is automatically overweight regardless of appearance or physique  but actually there is a considerable range of healthy sizes in adult APHs ranging from roughly g to over g. Going by the number alone doesnt work  its the same as if you were to judge a human adults fitness by just that number without taking their individual traits height physical build etc into consideration.,Hedgehog,cvmm6fm,6,t5_2rvox

7402410,0,t3_4gowcx,Cutie!You should consider getting a water dish for your little guy. He has to crane his neck to use a water bottle.,Hedgehog,d2jlst8,6,t5_2rvox
7552543,0,t1_d30oipp,Yeah he seems to only climb when he feels trapped or panicked such as during car rides. He didnt climb in his old tiny cage that we rescued him from but he definitely would if we put him back in there now. ,Hedgehog,d30oscw,3,t5_2rvox
7566615,0,t3_4iyg3h,I dont have enough time to respond to this whole post right now but I will say to try and get MEALworms not super worms. Super worms have a reputation for biting hedgies sometimes and even I dont feel comfortable feeding them to my fully grown hog unless I cut off the heads and tails first. Mealworms are smaller easier to chew from what I can tell and they seem to like them more. Also mealworms are something they eat in the wild generally. ,Hedgehog,d32ad13,0,t5_2rvox
8223299,0,t1_d54r1el,Thank you so much for your advice. Unfortunately it was too late for anywhere to be open to help when we found himher last night but we took care of them as best we could and took them to a local hedgehog carer who has taken them to a hedgehog vet today and will be getting back in touch to update us. Thank you again!,Hedgehog,d55gvjk,2,t5_2rvox
8263312,0,t1_d5afg4o,I didnt even know this was something they did lol. Did yours ever outgrow it or anything? This is blowing my mind ,Hedgehog,d5agzkf,3,t5_2rvox
8283232,0,t3_4stp74,Awwh pepper is soo cute!!! Congrats on your first hedgie!!! I would say yes bring her in because hedgehogs are prone to get infections and they can be fine one day and then dead the next....it will also give you an opportunity to just chat with the vet about the health of your little one and they can give suggestions on care etc... When I first got my little guy I took him in just for a general checkup the to be safe and found it super helpful,Hedgehog,d5cyoug,2,t5_2rvox
8444352,0,t3_4v6np0,How about a wheel meant for a larger rodent like a chinchilla? We have two chinchillas and two hedgehogs so I am familiar with both. Might I suggest looking into a wheel called The Chin Spin?  Just a thought! It has a  diameter that your hedgie beast could probably be more comfortable in.If you wanted to make something yourself get a heavy duty plaits or metal feed pan from Amazon or tractor supply mount it dead center to heavy duty lazy Suzan hardware and mount that to your cage.Both could work for you just depends on how much work you want to put into it!,Hedgehog,d5x2yr6,2,t5_2rvox

8688941,0,t1_d6rqkq1,Indeed we do have a Facebook page and its very active.  Lots of people daily asking questions that are answered by folks with decades of experience with breeding and rescue work.  Members share photos of their little ones and their homes. Several rescues from overseas belong and share videos and stories of their work with wild hedgies. You just search for the Hedgehog Welfare Society on FB and they come right up ,Hedgehog,d6rqu9d,3,t5_2rvox
8771379,0,t1_d7220uq,Thats adorable and such a good idea! Unfortunately I just think Sherman doesnt like bath time. Its also a huge pain to clip his nails. I try to do them both one after the other and pretty quickly and then reward him with snacks and some quality nap bonding to make up for it. ,Hedgehog,d7236e7,2,t5_2rvox

9946878,0,t3_5ht8ew,my hedgie lets me do a lot of things to him but one thing he cant stand is HATS. I made him a birthday hat a Halloween hat and he didnt allow either one to stay atop his quilley head for longer than a second. Gotta admit Im a wee bit jealous! Your lil guy is precious!! I have to try this third times the charm ,Hedgehog,db43qhm,1,t5_2rvox

10331892,0,t3_5nnakr,Shaymin is the exact same way. I see everyone feeding their hogs everything and the kitchen sink and so I get excited give him something different and he just walks away. He only likes hit cat food and mealworms,Hedgehog,dcf6egi,2,t5_2rvox
10680251,0,t1_ddgknyq,We give her foot baths. She doesnt mind those so much as she does the actual baths. She just really likes playing in her litter box so we have to clean her off more often than just a once a week bath,Hedgehog,ddhl52q,1,t5_2rvox
