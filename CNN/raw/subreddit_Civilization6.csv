9654685,0,t1_d9yzzzk,Yes in previous versions of the game you would look to build a well rounded civ and latter focus on victory paths. On this game you seem to need a plan from the start. Also I have not played a game yet where no one has declared war for some reason or another. Pacifism and appeasing all Civs doesnt work as it did before.,Civilization6,da352z6,3,t5_397so
