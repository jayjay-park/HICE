702819,0,t3_227qkv,is fashion a big element of your book? for the novel im writing its not a very big issue. ive only had to describe what some of the characters wear out of a kind of necessity for the plot. for technologies just attempt to predict what may be created in the future. Daily life could be similar to what we have now or it could be more alien because society has changed so much in the future. honestly for science fiction I think the best is having a very different society from what we live in today it creates a lot of intrigue. although if your plot doesnt pay to much attention to the mundane everyday life its not as important. Just try to sit down and figure out how far your world has advanced in technology. Like are there super advanced cybernetic implants? space travel other world colonies? super realistic virtual reality? it helps to draw a chart or a point form outline of everything youd want to have in your novel. what type of government exists? are our countries the same or have they transformed? androidsclonesrobots? things like that. ,scifiwriting,cgk5vtq,1,t5_2vj04

I do it here to communicate the feel of the GodEmperors palace but I can very much see how it would be offputting for a reader. As for why Romans Im afraid I dont have much of a reason other than Rome is my passion. Many of the races in the book are based on ancient cultures and people. I originally set the story in the far distant future where as you said the Roman empire never fell but I ultimately decided it was too constricting. As it stands now the setting is a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. Thanks again for reading and your critique! Ill continue on that editing path. ,scifiwriting,cgp0c0n,1,t5_2vj04

1490167,0,t3_2b5myz,So theres a lot of problems with your first paragraph. Lets take a look at it. gtThe city was in darkness only the street lamps of the sky roads lit the night sky with electric light glistening on the smoke clouds of war. The sea was silent and the traffic was stationary everything on the edge of the abyss of darkness. The people were in standstill not in awe but in horror the sights of invasion on the safe enclave of the most powerful nation in the world. Of course that is what war was the unexpected the real the end of logic and the end of life.Firstly this is kind of a boring way to start a story. The biggest issue here though is theres a lot of sentence level stuff that needs to be reworked. This sentencegtThe city was in darkness only the street lamps of the sky roads lit the night sky with electric light glistening on the smoke clouds of war.A little too purple ...the smoke clouds of war and overly wordy. This is also just poor prose ...street lamps of the sky roads lit the night sky with electric light... Is there any reason youre specifying that the lamps are electric? I would assume them to be. I think the problem here and I see this often is that youre trying to write a story thats heavy with visuals. Thats great but it doesnt work out as well or quite the same visuals in scifi in print as it does on the screen. Focus on a good story not how cool things youre imagining look. Back to the poor start this is a short story. Dont waste your words. You dont have time to describe how the setting looks at the start. Its a boring entry and it wastes space. Just get right into things and youll be better off for it. Im not going to break down every issue from here on out but generally speaking I saw these same kinds of issues throughout. The mistakes someone makes on pages   and  are generally the same that theyll maybe on   and . Good luck. ,scifiwriting,cj32fqf,1,t5_2vj04

1772620,0,t3_2es2ha,Try to avoid the passive voice especially an incomplete passive voice gt And then fire erupted inside of his body as billions of nerve cells were triggered. In a second his dreamlike peace was shattered.Triggered by what? Shattered by what? Thats what I mean by incomplete. Its okay to use the passive voice from time to time depending on what purpose it serves but keep in mind that the passive voice often forces you to rely on the verb to be. If you use the same verb was  times in your story in a  ratio with a subject pronoun he  times you will inevitably trigger reader fatigue shattering your readers attention span in the process. Its okay to repeat subject pronouns over and over again so long as you dont repeat a single verb just as frequently. For example He woke. He stood. He lumbered. He shat. He showered. He shaved. He dove out the window. He flew. He broke every bone in his body. Now heres the same story with the kind of  ratio thats going on in your story He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He died. Avoid using the same verb over and over and reconsider the relationship between the subject and the object. Think of writing like a kind of vector geometry that blatantly disregards all laws and theoremsSubject and object represent the beginning and end of a particular path or sentence. Points A and B. The verb you use connects the two. The line connecting A and B. And the preposition if used adds an angle. So a sentence like I shot the cat would be a straight line between point A and point B. The verb being the line itself. However I sat on the cat is completely different than I sat with the cat. The preposition adds an angle. It shapes the path between A and B. Maybe the former possesses an acute angle while the latter possesses an obtuse angle. Whats more interesting? A series of identical lines on the page? Or a motley collection of lines and angles with varying sizes? Edit When you write you play with vectors. You give them angles curves spirals that never end. Sometimes you draw lines connecting point A back to point A and thus create shapes. The alphabet is arbitrary. The words we use are arbitrary. Just lines on paper. After all what is the alphabet if not a collection of vectors each one making its way from one point to the next attacking retreating flanking the next letter? Offer your sentences the same kind of freedom and you shouldnt have a problem. ,scifiwriting,ck2le2t,1,t5_2vj04
1800789,0,t3_2f37ph,Its the first time I have replied to one of these so its pretty much useatyourownperil here.I want to know more about this person who experiences a glitch in the instant travel device and ends up in an unintended place. Or Was every thing planned from the beginning of time to fulfill the prophecy of that place? For starters that is all the mystery I need to know in order to get me interested.And you have my attention. But I think youre trying to do too much at the same time and in the process you risk doing too little of anything. I could use more info about Balar in the early going. At the moment I know that Balar is an intersteller traveller who belongs to a race which seems to become very old compared to the universal average. I would also like to know if Balar is male female or something else. Is Balar human or even humanoid? I assume bipedal with two arms since there were both kneeling and tying of hands in the early going but Im not sure about the number of either legs or arms. I may come off as overly pedantic about this and the picture in my head of a male human with a youngish body but eyes which tell the story of a life much longer than his physical appearance suggests may be correct. The prolonged lifespan along with the lack of bodily functions just makes me wonder if this person is even remotely human.I would also like to know a little bit about why Balor is a traveller. Is that what Balars race or species does for a living? Or is it a big honor to be chosen? Or perhaps it is a sort of punishment?I think your story would benefit from setting the stage and introducing me to Balar and getting the story going first and then get back to the technical aspects of Gliding in The Strange as it becomes important to the story. You could start of by explaining the details in chapter four when Womm is asking Balar about it anyway. That would also give you an opportunity of explaining it like you would explain it to a five year old which I would certainly benefit from. But until then from a techological perspective its enough for me to know that Balar has a way of going anywhere in no time at all and that something went wrong. With that said I like your idea. I think your story has promise. I would very much like to read the final version when youre done. Good luck with it all!,scifiwriting,ck659um,1,t5_2vj04

The aliens were fleeing a hostile situation and got very ill during the travel and wound up on Earth with nowhere else to go since it was presumably the only backwater planet they could find with an atmosphere that wasnt toxic to them in some way.Parallels to the refugee situations coming out of western Africa Somalia middle east where LGBT people women etc. are fleeing oppressive regimes but are still treated like theyre subhuman by the country theyre applying to refugee status to. Or like how Mexicans trying to make a better life for themselves in the United States is labeled an alien invasion by white American nationalists.You could even do it in the How To Serve Man sense where humans meet a completely agreeable alien race that decides to modernize Earth for our own good as opposed to taking us over or anything. You could make it a case of humans being suspicious of these new alien benefactors and wondering if it isnt all a ploy. The greatest enemy of Utopia is suspicion and a tinge of doubt as its said. Similar themes were present in Star Trek Enterprise with the relationship between the Vulcans and Humans  many humans refused to see the Vulcans as anything else than an oppressor despite the Vulcans having no intent of enslaving us.

3884317,0,t3_34x4ci,I edited the first four pages for you. I like how it flows. It could use more polishing beyond what I suggested but I think my suggestions are a good start for a nd draft and they should help give you a good idea of how to approach similar issues discrepancies etc. in the latter half of your story.   I tried my best to retain your style. But I feel like you often misuse commas by connecting individual sentences because you think they are part of a single idea so I separated them. And I dont mean to garner any hate because I honestly cant think of a better way to say this but... This is what paragraphs are for. You have a very punchy style that works very well for your characters. And you should try to keep it that way. Your New Zealand rednecks are delightfully temperamental and their survival depends in their minds upon their kneejerk reactions. So stop trying to string standalone clauses together using commas when you can punch your way through the story with short backtoback subjectverbobjectstyle sentences the same way your redneck protagonists punch through life on a daily basis.  Disclaimer The following is not directed at you specifically. Im writing it because I consider it to be one of the most important tools for creative writingor any type of writing for that matterand therefore warrants repeating every once in a while. You may already know all of this but theres bound to be someone lurking around this subreddit who doesnt. And thats precisely the person whom this is for. After all feedback is not just for the person receiving it its for everyone else thats watching from a distance in the hopes of learning something new.Connotation is extremely important. Synonyms are fun to play with in order to prevent repetition but you have to pay attention to connotative differences. Lets say were talking about sex. We have many words for sex but lets stick to the following three fornicating fucking making love. All three of these verbs denote the same thing engaging in sexual intercourse. However they do not by any means connote the same thing. Fornicating has a religious connotation. Fucking has an aggressive connotation. Making love has a romantic connotation. These are crucial differences. You cant just say Well I already said they were fucking twice so this time Ill say they were making love. And there go your characters right out the window. Another example to decline and to refuse. They denote the same thing to say no. But they connote opposite reasons for saying no. To decline something implies that you are unable to say yes for reasons beyond your control. My boss invited me to join him for dinner but I declined because its my wifes birthday and I promised to spend the evening with her. To refuse something on the other hand implies that you are unwilling to say yes as a matter of principle My boss invited me to his sons Bar Mitzvah but I refused because I hate Jewish people and now I dont have a job. Depending on the circumstances it is polite to decline but it is rude to refuse despite the fact that both denote the very same act of saying no. That said when a group of scarylooking aliens possess appendages of all shapes and sizes we probably dont want to describe those appendages as assorted. Assorted is for candy ice cream chocolates and hors doeuvres. Motley on the other hand connotes the kind of variety that is perhaps unintended or purposefully chaotic.gt The jesters motley garb concealed a knife.  gt The prince refused to bed his fathers wife.  gt The kings assorted fruits betrayed the joke.  gt The queen declined to watch her lover choke.  So keep an eye on your synonyms. Subtle connotations can creep up on you and can destroy your characters from the inside out without you even realizing it. If youre going to use synonyms in order to avoid repetition make sure the connotation of the synonym you are about to use either matches or complements the connotations of the words youve already used. ,scifiwriting,cqz1na0,2,t5_2vj04

4175679,0,t1_crvp8pv,Okay I put Mars in orbit around the Earth at a distance of only  km. Thats still .x the Roche limit so it wont be torn apart. There could possibly be other moons much further out but theyd just look like bright stars from the point of view of people on either planet.Both planets are tidally locked so they always face each other. Neither will ever rise or settheyll just hang in the sky in the same position all the time. Half of each planet will therefore never see the other one at all. But where you can see the other planet navigation at sea will be a breeze the captain would find true north by measuring the position of the sun at noon and would then compute true longitude by measuring the angle to the big planet in the sky. Navigating the back sides would be harder since youd have no easy way to get longitude.The day on both planets is  hours and  minutes long.From Mars Earth is enormous degrees wide or  times the size of the full moon and thousands of times brighter. Reading at night would be a breeze.From Earth Mars is big too degrees wide or  times the size of the full moon and about a thousand times brighter.Because of the tidal lock on either world youll see the other world go through phases. Always halffull waning at dawn new at noon halffull waxing at sunset and full at midnight. During spring and fall there will be eclipses every day for about eight weeks. On Earth the longest eclipse will be  minutes long covering a much bigger chunk of the planet than when the moon eclipses the real Earth. On Mars itll be  hour and  minutes long and will cover the whole planet. The spring series will start at the north pole four weeks before the equinox reach the equator on the equinox and end with a southpole eclipse four weeks after the equinox. The fall eclipses will reverse the process. For a given latitude the dates of the eclipses would be the same every year. Predicting an eclipse would be like predicting spring. This makes sense because the other planet is a fixed object in the skylike a mountain. You wont just see a single eclipse youll see daily eclipses for  days roughly on Earth and for  days on Mars. Theyll be short to start get longer each day up to a point then get shorter again. Think of the arc the sun makes across the sky each day moving north in Spring and south in Fall.It would be possible to build a space elevator directly connecting the two worlds.

Lets hope this is the case!Re bundling with a longer workthis sounds like the best approach overall but I dont think I have the patience for it simply because my writing output is pretty slow.Ill probably end up putting this one out bundled with one or two short stories.

6901995,0,t3_4a2gvq,So this is the term that the ruling transhumanists use to refer to the synths? Since they are enslaved I assume they are considered lesser beings. The name should reflect that superiorcondescending attitude.And I couldnt tell from your description if the synths are selfawaresentient not sure what you mean by only from an outside source.If they are nonsentient then they are basically robots. How about Automs short for automaton? Or Robs or derived another step from that Bobs.How about golem? Or shorten it to Goles which rhymes with proles. Or Gollies implying that they are not very intelligent and likely less intelligent than the transhumans.,scifiwriting,d0ynrhe,1,t5_2vj04

7150301,0,t1_d1qwhos,They were already going to the moon. They did also create bunkers thats why there are still some isolated civilizations on Earth. The government of the moon knows Earth is livable again. But the people are kept in the dark as a form of control. They have shields over the dome to protect then but its really to keep them ignorant. The Martians cut contact voluntarily. Independence extremists. The Lunar government knows about them and theyve had some skirmishes over Europas water. Much of Earth is still way behind in technology. The countries that are more advanced have been too busy fighting each other to pay much attention to the moonMars. They have myths about them by no direct contact. I dont mind these kinds of questions. I think I do a pretty good job explaining it all in my book. So far my beta readers havent complained.

7297002,0,t1_d27k5v2,Loss is very slow but I dont know that we could make it thick enough to sustain life on the surface without some sort of supplemental pressurization wearing suits and helmets.  Its  times thinner than Earths atmosphere right now and wed need to find some way to greatly increase the density beside releasing CO and water vapor into the air.  While Mars only loses about  molecules per second about  grams to space if the atmosphere were thicker that number would increase.  Earth loses more air to space than Mars does x molecules mostly because there is much more air to lose but we are also protected by our magnetic field.  I dont know the math but increasing Mars atmosphere  fold would likely  this is an educated guess  have a similar increase in losses as well if anyone knows the real figures for this Id love to see them.  So while adding more gas to the atmosphere would be great in the short term its probably a good idea to consider the long term as well.Fortunately we dont really need a breathable atmosphere on the surface there are plenty of underground caverns and lava tubes we could pressurize and use as habitats a much simpler prospect than building a surface colony where radiation extreme temperatures and the thin air pose major issues.,scifiwriting,d27mba7,2,t5_2vj04
7347605,0,t1_d2ctukx,Id say its not really accepted at all. It depends a bit on genre.In literary or postmodern fiction readers are more likely to accept or even expect nonstandard presentation of prose especially in classics like James Joyce or acclaimed authors like Dave Eggers.

So if they have no reason to think that an alarm would cause anyone an extreme reaction to begin with then they will no appreciate that your character is reacting unexpectedly to an event. My advice would be to mention those elements that are not easily guessed by the reader if not in the moment then somewhere else in the story.,scifiwriting,d3v4k67,2,t5_2vj04

Youll want to hit on or at least hint at the interesting aspects of your protagonists. In scifi the world is also a character hell sometimes its the only quality character and you need to provide some glimpse of its interesting features.The overall plot isnt important in your blurb plot is like the rails on a track necessary to move things along but rarely interesting unless something goes wrong the reader takes for granted that the plot exists and is functional.  The immediate situation of your characters and the emotions caused by that situation are infinitely more important to hint at in your blurb.  ,scifiwriting,d4fl9hj,1,t5_2vj04

It would work better.

8610792,0,t3_4w5zzv,Hey dont listen to what a lot of the other people have said here. Yes it may be true that what was traditionally scifi is irrelevent because of the trajectory that technology is going. But guess what? The only thing we as humans can do is PREDICT the future. Everyone has lived their own lives and therefore has their own expectations and predictions so dont forget about YOURS Your argument is valid but also try to consider where everyone else is coming from. The significance of technological determinism look the phrase up should play a big role in your story. But yes I think you have a very Fallout Vault type drama going and it could be great! My suggestion would be to research media convergence and technological Singularity or things along this nature  even very briskly  because it can open your eyes up into new subplots or points to include in a tale that revolves mainly around human drama.Good luck ,scifiwriting,d6hy1ug,2,t5_2vj04

You know it says the same thing over and over again. I guess what Im trying to say is it repeats. Her face was wet. Waves were lapping at it.  This is repetition to the point of me becoming amused. Sorry. This is not a poem it doesnt need to repeat lines like this unless of course it is a poem? Also consider merging those two sentences into one. Same with the last two sentences at the end of this paragraph concerning pebbles.The sand was various shades of the same deep blue.  Again repetitive. Also its repetitive.There were cliffs behind him.  I think you mean her....beckys party tonight and socialize with other people her own age.  Capitalize the b in Becky because Becky is a name. Also I cant relate to this because Becky never invites me to her parties Speaking as someone whos been in school buildings late into the evening normally the doors will let you out but lock behind you.

Super picky of me though.Schrodingers Princess  I love that lol.In about thirty minute.  Needs fixing to minutes. While were here though first impression the military dialogue seems a little over the top. Get your hands on some real footage of field operations and model your soldier dialogue off of that. Right now it seems like a cheesy movie.Millions had died because of Hitlers war...  It would just be called The war. You could change it to something like the war Hitler caused.Alright I stopped just when it jumped back to Emily so you have an idea.Your first couple of paragraphs are actually the worst written part of this story. Which is bad because those need to be the strongest but from there the story gets a lot better.I really like your writing its quite good and you should write more. That being said this is a critique.Your dialogue with the soldiers is bad your story is a little cheesy at times like that. I like the open ended opening the stuff with Emily at the college is really good and I think overall your writing is quite nice.Long term you write in very short segments which isnt unusual for newer writers. As I had it described to me you have to work your way up to bigger stories usually. I think you need to work on making your segments longer but at least theyre interesting the way they are now. Your dialogue needs work the hardest part of writing in my opinion the descriptions are really great and parts of your story seem very real and easy to picture in my mind which is good. Overall I liked it very much.Fix the beginning though so others will actually get to your story! D,scifiwriting,d6iyhy6,1,t5_2vj04

9331337,0,t1_d8yp4nr,I think the difference is really visibilityDune is wellknown among those willing to sit and read a very heavy philosophyridden piece of classic scifi or watch one of the versions of it produced for screens large or small.Star Wars is wellknown among people who go to movies a much larger audience. Yes there is philosophy. Yes it is a classic piece of scifi since it basically created scifantasy it was originally classified in scifi. Tremors got away with it because the idea of sandworms was littleknown outside of the scifi community and their target demographic people who would go watch Mr. Miagi and Kevin Bacon fight sand worms in the desert in a Bmovie were not likely to cross over very much with that. If either Dune or Tremors had had the kind of exposure that Star Wars has had no one else would ever be able to use sand worms without claims of it being a knockoff or homage. Instead those who are aware of both look at Tremors as a campy take on or independent inspiration from a Herbert idea which is different that a knockoff.And Tremors is scifi set in the modern contemporary day. The scifi is just that evolution or something produced these oversized wormsnake creatures that hunt by sensing vibrations in the earth. It is pseudoscientific and entirely fictional. ,scifiwriting,d8ytcs5,1,t5_2vj04

Whose family politics does she end up grappling with birth family or hideout family?

The writing you have shared here is not your outline its a summary of a story someone else wrote.I sent you a very long message a week ago and you still dont seem to understand. You mistakenly believe that youve spent several months working on a story. In reality youve spent several months fantasizing about working on a story. You havent actually done any sort of creative work and its very important for you to understand that. Youve written down a summary of a video games plot and then pulled out minor parts of it and replaced them with parts from two or three other video games.I tried to offer you help and you just ignored me and continued on with your story. You need to understand the fact that the path youre walking down is a dead end. Let me say this again just to be as perfectly clear as possibleYou have to stop writing your story. You are wasting your time. You cannot rename the characters from BioShock Infinite and replace the bad guys with bad guys from other video games and then pretend youve written a story.The word for what youre attempting to do is plagiarism. Stop.If you wouldve just responded to my message then I wouldve let you have my own first idea which I tried to turn into a book for a few months in  to experimentplaylearn with so you could try to turn it into a story and see what that actually entails. I dont know why youre so convinced that the plot of BioShock Infinite is your idea but it most certainly isnt and you need to get a grip and come to terms with the fact that you have to abandon this idea. You cant even salvage this by turning it into a BioShock fanfic because its just a list of slightlymodified plot events from the game.
