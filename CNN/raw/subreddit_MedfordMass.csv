4669703,0,t3_3ewrks,You need to Google Street view maps the area and get some actual feedbackreactions from residents in the area. Even when covering neighborhoods for projects in school Id get myself to the area I was writing about. If I was being paid for it Id get my ass out there. Not seek aggregated data from others. That is simply lazy,MedfordMass,ctj631r,1,t5_30i75
4803057,0,t3_3ewo4n,I wouldve tried to make it but what I will do is call the governors office and make an inquiry. Obviously the town of Medford isnt handling this correctly...edit by that I mean conveniently losing online complaints,MedfordMass,ctzyre3,3,t5_30i75
7773967,0,t1_d3pmu14,Dont hold your breath! The contractors have said its not going to happen and by the way the state officials and secretary of transportation has been silent on why or how this is going forward proves its never going to be built.Dont you read the online media quoting her There are no guarantees the GLX will move forward? This has been said repeatedly by her and the governor.There are far more mass transit projects which are more important than carting spoiled ingrates around a short  miles.No need to be jealous of our locals good fortune. It must be tough having a job handed to you after your parents pay your tuition rent and cars. No flea bags here thats why developers are trying to break down our doors. If they renovate its because the newcomers only want granite steel and glass as it matches their cold  narcissistic boring self.There is still no guarantee the project will be built the state can still cancel it in the future officials said.Read the entire story there are more than a few sources and you should know that headlines are intentionally misleading in order to increase readership.If there is not enough funding the project will not go forward. ,MedfordMass,d3pu5bx,2,t5_30i75
