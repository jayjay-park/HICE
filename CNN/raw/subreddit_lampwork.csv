130019,0,t1_cesznwn,Thanks I will try this. I am getting better at making centered marias so my implosions are symmetrical the marble mold makes getting a nice lens simple but as noted in another post my loops are lackluster. Do I need to worry about adding any extra glass since I am pulling glass away from the ball? I will go try it now I am curious about how I can get them to hang better. This may help achieve that. I appreciate the feedback. ,lampwork,cet8kp5,1,t5_2saoj

I started last may I would recommend condensing the glass a bit to make your bowls thicker that way your holes come out a bit smaller and plant doesnt fly through.

1266252,0,t1_cic24lc,no problem!  For the above tubing I coiled white over a piece of  tubing probably something like .x  striped a smaller diameter exp. green over it and then sleeved in x.  The green definitely pops under clear.    as you continue working with glass youll start thinking about clearcolor ratios more often.  for example if I wanted the green even thinner I could use more white andor clear in the overall equation   or I could alter the angle of laying the rod down..  Ratios are key and are often overlooked by a few lampworkers.  The easiest way to think about ratios is the opacity of lined tubing.  You start with mm rods in a vacstack should you use thinner or thicker tubing for the inner and outer sleeves? What is the desired result?  There certainly is an overall easier workability and appearance with the right combination.. I could talk about this stuff all day so Im stopping now best of luck!!,lampwork,cic2i7h,1,t5_2saoj

1403831,0,t1_cis7cdz,I see what you mean now. FYI I got my torch off of Eric area on top. It comes extra with a  tip which is normally not included with the standard kit which is the one I use.  Definitely have to open my propane a good amount to have a nice  inch flame then I turn on the oxy like a quarter of an inch of a turn or so... Barely anything and Im set.

1408821,0,t1_cistytl,No problem! I use that exact pair and they work really well. They still generate a bit of scuzz as well sometimes unfortunately.Try them out how they come normal with the ends flat and give the hot glass a squeeze with them then move the tool forward and backwards to help tear through the glass in between the tweezer the moving motion is what helps really helps create the hole between.Ive noticed that with the flat ends generate more scuzz I believe its mainly because of the tool being dirty and with the flat ends it creates more glass trash because of the extra surface area of the contact patch.What I do is grind the tweezer ends to a point and always make sure they are clean before use. Its harder to make the hole and makes a much smaller hole but almost always leaves it without scuzz with the modification.,lampwork,cisviqn,1,t5_2saoj

1874417,0,t3_2fz3o3,This place is the best I have found to order tools from. They have expensive and inexpensive options in many tools you will find useful along your way. Everything I have bought from them hasnt broken on me unlike some other companies...I dont use jacks you can skimp on those. Like IcarusJones said go to your welding supply and ask for graphite gouging rods and listen to the man and peel off the copper! Dont heat that stuff up copper fumes are not good for you. I use gouging rods to flare the open tubes. Normal tweezers work but I say get a good pair tungsten if you can afford them they are my favorite.Reamers and marver pads you can go cheap.I dont use claw grabbers I hear that the more expensive generally the better they are.

Personally I wouldnt bench cool soft glass at all but if you can get away without it cracking with a fiber blanket or vermiculite for instance batch annealing should be fine.  And no glass shouldnt be tacking until well above annealing temperature.,lampwork,crgukgw,4,t5_2saoj
4501273,0,t3_3cqk1n,If youre hellbent on doing this find an artist local to you and start with a small order and dont you dare go overseas. Also look into what laws youll need to comply with for your business. Dont try and cheap out. People will pay for nice glass even if theyre just spoons. If youre actually thinking about monetization think about getting something with your logo on it and buy a small run of them as an experiment  maybe  in various styles then let your audience vote on which one you should offer as your official merch. Then you can think about sinking some capital into this.Really this is an expensive business. Going yeah I just want the cheap stuff does not look good to glass artists because it sets off alarm bells about possibly being screwed over by you  after all if youre so dead set on the cheapest option the concern is that youll try to leverage Chinese and Indian pricing to screw over the domestic artist.

4698017,0,t1_ctmp3ae,People talk shit on import color but honestly I think it is almost entirely dependant on user skill. Import colors tend to move slightly differently in the flame than American colors the black is extra stiff and yellow Pink and Lavender are super viscous like clear. Amber Pink and Lavender are all pretty common import colors Im not sure if there are a whole lot of rare import colors. Im really partial to Yellow it melts smother and with less boiling than TAG Honeybadger and everyone Ive given a stick to has agreed. China black eventually ruins something somehow inevitably. I think the COE is a little off because Ive seen multiple pendants where the lens literally sheared clean off the China Black backing. Jade White is another import color that I love its a buttery great  translucent milky white that doesnt have an American equivalent. As far as incompatibility Id just avoid China black and possibly GreenLake Green as Ive heard those sometimes dont play well with clear either. ,lampwork,ctmq32b,3,t5_2saoj

I know its tempting to drive headlong into this but be prudent and pragmatic. Lampworking is an awesome hobby an amazing profession and just downright cool... but its also insanely expensive. Prohibitively so for many. If youve got cash out the ass yeah buy the torch why not? But if youre like so many of the rest of us and not made of money spend some more time behind the torch before you purchase one of your own. Ive seen too many people dive in balls deep only to realize that lampworking is hard... really hard. And its hot. And its dangerous. Make sure you know what youre getting yourself into. I just dont want you to toss this money at the torch set up and then have to flip it a few months later for way less than you paid for it. But ultimately the call is yours. Its not a bad deal. But be careful about posting links to something like this. Someone might snake you on it! ,lampwork,dg85dr6,4,t5_2saoj
