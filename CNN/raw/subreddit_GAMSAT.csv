6971005,0,t3_4b2kkv,First time GAMSAT sitter. I felt overall that I was okay with timing for section  but extremely pressed for time for sections  and . I didnt finish section one or three and so I guessed a lot of the answers so not confident with section  at all. Section  Im pretty happy with although I pray my pieces were not generic or unoriginal. Section III I think I answered around  of the questions and so the remaining few I honestly had to guess or quickly do. Im not really sure how Ive gone but if I dont do as well and need to redo it I know exactly what I need to improve on so I guess its a good trial run!,GAMSAT,d16i16g,1,t5_2vvga
10236313,0,t3_5mi6au,Some constructive criticism This video is so vague that it doesnt really give any information at all. Include some examples when you mention the  steps Identify points Interpret context Select answer. I also feel this could be half as long as a lot of info was repeated or unnecessary. But there were also some good tips as well such as dont rote memorize things and to stagger practice exams. That information is specific and doable more akin to a GAMEPLAN. If you can include more SPECIFIC advice like that for your other points it would be better. Would be worth it to just straight up go through a question or two and explain how to tackle the problem step by step. Goodluck ,GAMSAT,dc4cd7t,2,t5_2vvga
