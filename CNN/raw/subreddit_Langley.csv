8739295,0,t1_d6x895x,Been going here for  months. Find it clean. Very very clean. People are super friendly and open to talking to you.  Machines are brand new and highend. Cardio classes are fun  full of people and instructors easy to talk to.  Cardio classes are also updated regularly to new routines and music frequently.  In Langley you really do get what you pay for. Golds is not the cheapest but they really do provide a better overall experience for their customers.  We tested every gym in Langley before picking Golds. ,Langley,d6y28tn,2,t5_2ueu5
