7978353,0,t1_d4ctqpm,When the fps was in the s I did not really experience any issues perhaps it might have been headache inducing over time I dunno but Ten Forward being in the s was pretty much unplayable in VR. Another thing I failed to mention was that the starsun looks odd in VR as the graphical effects are displayed differently on each side of the headset Vive. I noticed the same thing in the earlier VR test you had released a month or two ago.In the future would it be possible to have a mode that lacks shadows used in everything but the lowest setting but still display the higher quality textures? I actually like how peasant mode looks lightingwise feels a bit more like the TV show while on the higher settings the overall lighting gives me the feeling like Im on the set during the filming of the Generations movie. ,stage9,d4cubtf,1,t5_3de30
8849645,0,t1_d7bjcoc,I completely overhauled the lighting a few months back. In fact the lighting is by far the most timeconsuming part of this project very hard to get it just right and to try and elminate the weird Unreal Engine Lightmap quirks.,stage9,d7blo41,3,t5_3de30

9445344,0,t1_d9d7z57,Indeed. Ive got that in the list so sort out. Plus Ive noticed some of the models dont really match and the shape of the carpets. hoping to get all that fixed  ,stage9,d9d9ivn,1,t5_3de30
9669671,0,t1_da4x3qi,The same thing happened to me.  Theres a file that you can edit called GameUserSettings.ini in StageSavedConfigWindowsNoEditor.  I changed the resolution to my resolution and lowered the all the settings to  and it fixed everything.,stage9,da4zmx3,2,t5_3de30
10194049,0,t1_dbmsyz8,The judder is an ongoing issue. Theres a whole bunch of new technologies that can help with this like multires shading. Its basically trying to render a bunch of data twice and that data isnt particularly optimised.Main Engineering I have seen this bug. It doesnt happen in the project it only happens in the compiled build so its hard to disagnose. Im  certain its due to the warp core tube blurred glass shader I can replace this easily.Good idea regarding the reset to default position ill add that in! I had thought Id solved most of the teleporting outside the ship issues but it does still happen sometimes.Voice controls! Ive been looking into this. theres a plugin for UE which does exactly this and I did have a play with it the problem is that its not massively accurate so youd probably need to shout RED ALERT!  different times in variations of englishamerican accents for it to understand you. It just needs a bit more work I think.,stage9,dbzjv1c,1,t5_3de30
