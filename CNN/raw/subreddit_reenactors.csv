6231247,0,t3_40wm65,The more you can do to talk to people face to face as opposed to email the better.  Its a pretty tightknit community and while Ive never found that Ive had any trouble breaking into it for any reason I have noticed that actually talking to someone at an event will get you remembered whereas emails dont really stick.  Phone calls are the next best thing but theres really no substitute for facetoface.  I will say that Facebook has been a great medium for a lot of units though so once youre in a group its not so hard to keep up with them if they have a FB group or page for their unit.,reenactors,cyxxata,3,t5_2s7fh
