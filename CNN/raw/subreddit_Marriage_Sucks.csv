11677566,0,t1_df96dlh,Its sad. I think my husband could write this same thing. But for him not you he never sawsees that I was working hard at home. At some point there is enough money and at what costs? I feltfeel I am ok with him working as hard as he does. Hes out all hours networking coming home drunk and I say nothing. When I used to it is you dont understand what I do respect what I do appreciate this life Ive given you. There comes a point when I stopped caring and prefer him gone. I never asked to be a millionaire. Its wonderful and I enjoy it but what I do want is ask a husband a partner. He became entitled to do whatever because Look at this life I give you! And I became resentful of whos hes become. You know what.....Im entitled to millions if we divorce. Half the company I dont even want it. Ive been a stay at home mom for  years and my future looks pretty damn bleak. Sounds snotty but Ill take a  cheap home a few hundred thousands to pay for things while I go back to school and monthly help until I get my crap together. I cant stand the idea of being tied to him financially for the next  years while our kids grow up. I want happiness. But Im stuck for now. Anyways I was venting. Sorry. ,Marriage_Sucks,dgjo2wx,2,t5_321n5
