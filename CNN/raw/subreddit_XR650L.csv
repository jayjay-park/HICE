In hindsite I probably could have just upped the jet size  or  and adjusted the pilot screw. If your bike is stock  filter  exhaust  I would just try with just drilling out the pilot adjustment plug and adjusting the pilot screw out  to . turns and see where that leaves you. The pilot screw  pilot valve is what meters the fuel in the transition from main jet throttle to idle jet idle. I think that is where we experience the lean popping. Also swap out the plug for an iridium NGK DPREIX,XR650L,d71atuo,5,t5_337es
