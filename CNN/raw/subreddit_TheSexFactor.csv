7899386,0,t1_d43az4n,Based on this episode I think Id cut Johnny before Buddy. Hes had some good scenes and he was ready to make an effort and it seemed obvious that Adrian was much more to blame for derailing the scene. Johnny hasnt been able to get it up a couple times now.,TheSexFactor,d43yqwe,2,t5_31zy5

8029331,0,t1_d4ikc83,Hmm I dont know. I think I still would have auditioned because I was having fun with the contestants and the crew was damned supportive. ,TheSexFactor,d4iklr6,8,t5_31zy5

8216096,0,t1_d533uif,seriously doubt that. The producers know nothing about creating a narrative and rig the competition to favor certain contestants.,TheSexFactor,d54kf7g,12,t5_31zy5
8382140,0,t1_d5p6p15,Did you watch the episode?Basically they eliminated Hero and he goes into a grandiose overthetop speech using eloquent language to thank everyone judges other contestants and the production team and then he says there is one last thing thats been on my mind for some time. He says that he would love to have a threesome with Remy and her boyfriend. Totally unexpected but I laughed pretty hard. ,TheSexFactor,d5pbdlq,13,t5_31zy5
8499950,0,t3_4w1wxo,I think you may be looking for usexfactorguy.  If hes not Buddy Ruben as utsfcolonel suggests then he at least seems to work for the show.,TheSexFactor,d641nui,5,t5_31zy5
