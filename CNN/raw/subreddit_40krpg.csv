415700,0,t3_1yu7l6,I imagine that at least as far back as the st millenium was concerned most if not all instruments of old still exist albeit with slight modifications or different names. Legions such as the Emperors children were very fond of artistic pursuits and in the book Fulgrim there are entire passages that speak of operas concerts and other musical gatherings within the Empire The Emperors children themselves would later turn some of these instruments to lethal weapons. Now within the st millennium I imagine that music has fallen to the wayside I would argue that this is because like the actual dark ages of our own history the imperiums own dark age is not conductive for music that isnt propaganda for the benefit of the church of the emperor. So I would imagine that all of these instruments are still around but that except for some truly churchfriendly instruments such as the organ choirs these instruments can only be found in the hands of the common man.,40krpg,cfnupyq,1,t5_2stnr

604497,0,t3_210lfr,The main reasons have been touched on here by multiple posters. But the other reason Ive discovered though less common is the Why cant I be a girlmarine factor.If your group has any females in it DW is a very hard sell. Youre either a posthuman male warrior monk killing machine or youre a human adjunct that has no real purpose except for expositionbot when the killing stops. Now personally as a female roleplayer I love the challenge of actually roleplaying a space marine as written. My Space Wolf is my favourite character Ive ever played and the people I played with seemed to enjoy my characterisation of him. But I know plenty of other women who just dont grok why there cant be girlmarines but who dont want to be a civilian attach either and so would rather just play any of the other k RPGs where they can get their XX chromosome on.,40krpg,cg8zgj9,6,t5_2stnr

Skin colour or gender even sexual preferences does not really come into play that much.However there are certain practices in various places some regiments might be female only or men only while others are mixed regiments. Noble houses might develop with a focus on having women or men in the role and certain planets can have different viewpoints. I personally would think that the differences comes into play more in places like Feudal worlds than the populated hive worlds.However it is up to each GM to choose how to focus on it because it seems to be an option here if gender roles play a part or not is left to the players and the GM the world itself does not pay too much heed to it.,40krpg,cg943rr,5,t5_2stnr

If you were to do something like this again I think its reasonable to just have a table rule to not fiddle with your phones during the game and have them all on silent.  If you need to check a message thats fine but make it quick and discrete.One possibility on what is happening is that your onenighters have no investment in the ongoing story arc and so get bored during the debrief when youre revealing story arc information.

6801555,0,t3_48poof,Inquisitors are stated to as a base have roughly  or  I cant remember influence. The highest base Influence is like . People generally only gain  influence per story arc which is roughly  sessions which nets around  xp per session. So you can work out the xp roughly from there.As per rules however the Inquisitor should have a higher influence than their acolytes I go with the average of all their Influence doubled. Because the acolytes can call upon the influence of their inquisitor for requisition.As stated you dont need to stat them if they never need to meet the inquisitor in person. However the acolytes might make social tests against them so having a set willpower might be good. But keep it set. If its  WP once then keep it that way.If I decided to have an inquisitor I would stat them myself to get a good idea of the kind of person they are but Id never tell the acolytes I stated them or let them be in a position of having any idea of their combat prowess.I would find the closest equivalent for the kind of person you want in the book and modify as necessary for other npcs just remember that npcs do not need to be built according to the rules of creation. Your Inquisitor doesnt either but I find it helps personally.Im more curious about that last line what kind of things would you not want them to fight? Would they ever be under the impression that there are things that are forbidden for them to do? If so then Id tell them and then let them try and cover it up. Remember theyre acolytes and part of a warband they are generally watched by someone at some point at any given time or their inquisitor could just have a high Scrutiny skill.Alternatively you can just use the mook rules see when they hit  wounds and let them die or go even further for npcs just have them die.

Or write down one secret for the whole interrogation?The entire thing. The context is they were a Rogue Trader crew and an Inquisitor was interrogating them to see if they were heretics. They werent but basically everyone has something that they dont want to reveal and the trick was whether or not you can hold that back or whether you spill your guts about some personal secret. The whole point was that they knew there was nothing really heretical to give away but the Inquisitor didnt so they all knew they were being pointlessly tortured. ,40krpg,d1jdwhr,4,t5_2stnr

7185501,0,t3_4dwfyi,gt So... anyone got any reccomendations or ideas for what to do?Use another system. Its just not the way FFGs rules work and its clear that they have no interest in this style of play. At all. They did attempt to patch this with Horde rules but... yeah... those arent great.Your example doesnt even include gear though when they are rocking carapace or power armour and force fields PCs become virtually unkillable but are able to butcher legions of lesser enemies. And even that doesnt account for Step Aside.There are three solutions in systemYou can choose to scale up enemy gear but this results in fights where even some bumpkins have conversion fields and good photovisors so they dont blind each other to even begin opposing your PCs.You prevent the PCs from accessing highlevel gear at all.You dont have any fights with low level enemies or you resolve them off screen i.e. the PCs have guards or something and whenever a fight breaks out the minions fight the minions and leave the PCs to fight the big bads. This is a terrible idea... but it works well in Rogue Trader actually.As you can see those are all sorta rubbish ideas but the higher you go with any of FFGs system the worse this power creep problem becomes and there really is no way to fix it. The sweet spot for FFG games is around twice starting XP everything after that starts to get a bit annoying due to gear creep and talents.Personally I try to set up situations where fighting is not a great choice i.e. diplomacy or using the environment to deal with enemies are better options and reduce any fights to the cinematic moments against significant enemies or absolute legions of low level enemies who mostly depend on luck to run down the PC defences.,40krpg,d1uxgen,1,t5_2stnr
7401252,0,t1_d2ip0lo,Middle figure is a terminator they are an elite choice in space marine armies and have one of the best armor saves in the game in addition to protective power force fields. In the lore the armor is super rare and only given to the elite of the chapter. Chapters are lucky to field a squad or two.

10121336,0,t3_5ksz4l,I tend to play the the Warhammer rpgs with the expectation that everyone will die go insane or be a lump of growling flesh and fur.  It just fills that role really well.  Characters are short lived but they burn bright.  And Corruption and Insanity mechanics see that no character will last too long.  They are sort of the countdown to doom for any character.  You can survive hundreds of battles but eventually you will break.  Just kind of the theme of these kinds of settings.  But....On the off chance you want a more long term dndesque sort of adventure its as easy as simply...reducing how often you give them corruptioninsanity or if at all.  You can remove them from the game entirely perhaps replacing them with a temporary debuff of some sort.  I think it changes the spirit of the game tremendously by shifting the game more towards your dnd lighthearted romp through the woods as murderhobos but its your call in the end.  Just know that if these are new players their first few games are critical to shaping what they may wind up enjoying.  If you do want to have more classic grim and gritty roleplaying you may shoot yourself in the foot by getting them used to long lasting superheroes.,40krpg,dbqtfkr,2,t5_2stnr

10688349,0,t3_5sse8n,Burning a fate point to survive certain death is a bit different than being reborn entirely. Burning a fate point would be like taking a lascannon shot that cuts you in half but cauterizes the wound so you dont immediately bleed out. Its luck or divine intervention that you get another chance at life. A perpetual would be blasted to ashes and simply reappear somewhere else perfectly fine and ready to continue their mission. Beings like Saint Celestine and the Legion of the Damned and the Sanguinor are neither of these theyre more like Daemons of the Emperor than being perpetuals or simply lucky. ,40krpg,ddif9v2,3,t5_2stnr

11142537,0,t3_5ys3ay,Rituals are not all hocus pocus. An example of a ritual of maintenance for a firearm could include sacred unguents gun oil and the process of disassembly cleaning polishing reassembly and calibration. They have an amount of chanting and hand waving. It might include firing a set number of bullets to see if the process was correct and if it fails to make a holy pattern sighted shots hitting their targets it may require a reblessing additional cleaning and calibration or a spiritual cleaning and removal of offending machine spirits removing and replacing damaged components These rituals are often commonplace maintenance which has been religious indoctrinated. Similar to how a shaman might take herbs and boil them while chanting. From a science standpoint they could be taking a plant which contains opiates and they are distilling the effective ingredients into a liquid which could be ingested and have similar effects. The admech much like the shaman doesnt understand the science behind the ritual but can understand the results and associates the result with both the verbal components with the physical preparation. ,40krpg,deuzu8p,6,t5_2stnr

They might use Navigators to track its warp trail and potentially use traps and disguises to get close to the players to learn their weaknesses before taking them down committing lesser evils to gain their trust and making it seem like theyre actually allies before turning on them. Also if your players are operating in Imprrial space and make too much noise chances are the big I would get called in.,40krpg,dgm0q7a,1,t5_2stnr
