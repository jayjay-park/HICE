Another older white male teacher kind of just shut the TV off in disgust and we went about our day. I went home and my parents particularly my dad had a completely different take on the entire situation. He wasnt happy but I remember him saying something to the effect of they got a taste of their own medicine. I didnt really get that either because I was about . But as an adult watching the documentary with the knowledge of all Ive learned about race relations I kind of understood but that documentary completely shed entirely new light on it. If it were in a movie theater I would absolutely sit through the entire thing for  hours.
