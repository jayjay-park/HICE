1947886,0,t3_2gxpq2,The Mk is a great car but I think it has reached its limelight and being an older German car it is a lot harder to maintain.It got to the point w my Mk .t that I was replacing something fixing something stopping a leak finding a boost leak replacing a hose finding an oil leak finding a coolant leak replacing the downpipe the flex pipe started to unravel on me and the one day it just tore apart and in the end the turbo seals.  Every  weeks there seemed to be an issue w the car or I was cleaning oil out of the intakeinter cooler path.It was a lot of little thing but the turbo seals is what did me in.  As someone that is very mechanically inclined it was easy to do fixes but it was a lot and I couldnt imagine having to pay someone to do them.My car was a  and it was very well maintained and after I got it I never really stressed it.  Yes I like to get places fast but I would never push that engine at all.  A few of my friends have Mks and they have a lot of similar issues one of them has a  Jetta Wolfsburg which I swear hate us as he seems to have more issues than most of us.In short it is a money pit but so is most older cars the Mks though sure do like their upkeeping.  After seeing what the Mk had in store for us I went and test drove a Mk and love everything about it more than the Mk but that is just me.My opinion is go test drive a good Mk see if it grows on you currently there are a lot of good deals on them so finding one w k on it is not bad nor is it expensive.  Better interior better steering wheel many options quite a looker especially if you get some OEM LED tails an actual moon roof that is the same size on both sides.

I have a mkv with the dsg and it took a little while to get used to the system but once I learned more about how it works it has grown on me. The biggest thing I still struggle with in manual mode is knowing what gear Im in. With a standard you can always tell what gear youre in by the position without looking. With the dsg if you lose track you have to divert attention to the gear annunciation on the mfd. I think with the manual you are always involved so you never loose track of whats happening. Most of the time with the dsg you are in auto and can get complacent. I do have to say the dsg is great for me its just more of a mental adjustment. Next vw I buy will be a dsg.

Its not a secret that VWs with a  in them are not up to the exact same quality as Ws. The same goes for s like the Passat built here in America. Plus having a German car along with people who know a little about VWs you tend to know that if its made in Germany and from Germany its more than likely going to be put together well or at least better than one in a outsourced country. This may come as odd but I did give up on this generation of VWs as I will no longer own a VW vin. So far the mks are doing alright with only one or two recalls. Hell my wifes passat already has  of them and its a VW.

It tells you what the difference is in diameter which would be the main factor in deciding if it would fit. In my example the diameter is half an inch larger which should fit in the wheel well fine without rubbing. Its also about  inch more sidewall which is what I was looking for for winter. The recommended minus size for me at tirerack.com is  which is a smaller diameter tire and would lower the car almost a half inch. I dont want it to be lower in the winter time and have to plow through more snow which I why I went with a slightly higher diameter.The other way to get more sidewall if you stay with the same size tire would be to get a narrower tire with a higher aspect ratio. So if you started with a  you could get a winter tire thats  and it would be narrower with more sidewall. Keep in mind that different tire sizes will impact your speedometer and the calculator shows you that as well. So this example is a  difference in diameter so at mph on your speedometer youd actually be travelling at . mph with the new tire. ,GolfGTI,cvof2rl,1,t5_2tzrn

Generally things that differ GTI from ST apply to R vs RS  former is more refined classy comfortable DSG and DCC good quality interior the latter offers you more fun with its AWD system driving modes and got the more sportyricey depends on people look and will be probably more raw than R.Both cars I assume RS gonna be as its still not in production are super cool and they have their own pros and cons  decision depends on the person needs and requirements.

I had this feeling that these wheels were gonna get scratched and it came true.  The only problem is another shop found it the next day when I went to get the tires filled with nitrogen since Firestone didnt do that.  I also had the other shop recheck the balance because it felt a little off to me.  They asked if I knew the wheel was scratched and my heart sank.  I wasnt able to check last night due to the darkness and rain.  ,GolfGTI,cy3lv50,4,t5_2tzrn

So my advice to you is to spend the  on a quality downpipe like one from  Draft Designs DD here Ive had  downpipes from various sellers on eBay with Megan Racing being the last and all with stainless steel that rusted through in  year flat so thats why Im saying to spend the money if youre going to do a downpipe.Also I may be wrong about this but chances are you have an O sensor just past the catalytic converter so get the O spacer and thatll solve the CEL  MIL for the extra flow. Also while were on the subject if you have to get an emissions inspection you may even fail with a high flow cat you may want to look more into that because Ive heard of it happening I didnt need a test and was wo a catalytic converter.At this point you might be wondering if its worth the headache with a k and no tune I noticed an awesome bump in performance. Youll lose your mind with excitement with a tune  downpipe! An intercooler is probably a good idea too but not really necessary to my knowledge.Edit FWIW that downpipe was on a MK with the AWP hp motor and had a magnaflow exhaust.,GolfGTI,czdfdtu,1,t5_2tzrn

6835862,0,t3_49ec1q,The DSG is know for being a bit finicky when it comes to day to day driving.  That said my DSG doesnt have any issues downshifting in D or S on its own.  Driving in S though does create a unnecessary high shift point for down and up shifts which in turn can create rough shifts.  For me though w k on mine have no issues w mine and it is rather smooth.Always leave your car in DS and even in manual mode the car knows how to handle downshifts wo driver inputs when coming to stops.  You also start wasting gas as you throw it into neutral.  Engineering Explained just made this good video on why you should never shift out of your drive gear  I know the DSG is not a conventional automatic but the fuel savings applies to the DSG as it does shut down most fuel to the injectors.Does it create excessive wear?  No?  Not that I know of as long as you stay on top of your fluid intervals.  Most DSG owners are not having issues w high mileage k  on the DSG.,GolfGTI,d0r5at3,3,t5_2tzrn

6932421,0,t3_4ag273,So Ill be the semidissenting vote here.  GTI Autobahn DSG Dont get me wrong when my car is running well I love driving it. But the problem is that Ive had some fairly regular every  mos or so issues that worry me.I bought it in  when it had around k on it. CPO warranty. REVO Stage  tune and VW DG springs. Over the following  years my car broke down on  separate occasions and was towed to the dealer to replace ignition coils. Even after the first two VW refused to replace all  at once. Each time was radically incovenient  on the way to work  in the mountains on an anniversary getaway with my wife  upon turning my car on in the morning to head to a job interview  when attempting to get to a meeting with my boss at a clients office.After that all was well for maybe  months. Then I was getting misfires and a CEL.  Ended up needing a new intake and a carbon cleaning. I had to pay for the cleaning  I think. Then it was fine for  months. Then a fuel injector went bad so that was replaced. Then  more months. Then another fuel injector. This time coupled with a leaking rear main seal because of a DV clog. DV was warrantied RMS was not. Original quote was . Opened a claim with VWoA and had it reduced to  out of pocket. Then  months. Then another intake. Then  more months another injector plus a carbon cleaning again . This last injector went out as I tried to accelerate into traffic flow pulling out of my neighborhood. It wasnt superredline or anything maybe just spirited. Since then I havent felt confident that I can actually rev my car above plain old city driving levels. Im rather afraid that the next time I do Ill lose another fuel injector and spend  hours waiting on a tow truck and  hours waiting at a shop all to shell out more cash on a car thats relatively expensive to maintain anyway. I dont believe all GTIs are like this. I feel pretty certain my experience is opposite of the norm. But there are contrasting stories to ITS AWESOME! IVE NEVER HAD ISSUES!,GolfGTI,d12469i,1,t5_2tzrn

7398684,0,t1_d2ir5t8,I hate to disagree with this but engine break in happens in the first  miles.  More to the point all new engines are broken in at the factory.  What break in means is that the piston rings wear to the cylinders in such a way  that they seal.  Many engine builders actually suggest full throttle runs as soon as an engine can run off and on for the first  miles.  The high pressure and fast cylinder speed allow the piston rings to quickly wear in and seal tight to the cross hatching on the cylinder walls.  After the first  miles you just want to avoid cruising at the same rpms for any length of time up to  miles.  That constant rpm could potentially cause a pattern in the cylinder wall to form and again reduce sealing.  Getting a tune wont hurt anything at K just try not to cruise at mph for hours at a time until  miles.  Other than that the engine should be broken in already.

Red footwell LEDs and red trunk LEDs improve the appearance a lot and improve interior visibility as well the red also complements the exterior colour wellPerformance mods I would recommend a  aluminum dogbone mount insert to reduce the slop and improve the response of the car while shifting and accelerating from a standstill.

7597052,0,t1_d35n7v9,Ill cater to your question. I learned to drive manual on an old Miata. Getting into the GTI I found that I was relearning manual due to the vague clutch. Id say put a couple hundred more miles on the car and see how you feel. This makes learning the clutch much easier and the more advanced techniques rev matching and quick shifting x easier. The clutch engages more fluidly now and I would say you will learn much better after this mod. Heck you can even take it into a local euro shop and have it done professionally. Its an easy enough job to do alone and well worth the  mins. Hope this helps feel free to ask any more questions,GolfGTI,d35qvtq,2,t5_2tzrn

Thats all thats different. Autobahn makes no senseThis is for the . Prior to this year the autobahn had the nav but they removed the nav option for carplay. Then you have the light package and performance pack.  The lp light pack has led lights and sensors that turn your lights as you go in corners. These are nice and replacement look alikes are about .  I like the replacement look myself and went nonlp.The pp adds a electronic diff. Thats really it. The diff is amazing but the added horsepower does nothing because it offsets the weight of the diff.  If you like doing aggressive mountains or digging into crazy corners get the pp. I didnt get it as I mostly drive in straight lines.On and get a tune.

Not to mention increasing the work load on the water pump and the rest of the cooling system. In all honesty you shouldnt even be shifting into first at all after you have started moving. Its bad for the synchros and the entire transmission which is the same as your motor increasing the friction more than necessary. Lets not forget about the motor and trans mounts that youre beating up. They can only handle but so much bucking of the drivetrain before they start causing excess ride discomfort every time you shift or punch the throttle. Everything youre doing is awful for your car and youre doing this during a period where you should be taking it easy for the most part. Youre beating your car to a piece of junk.

I had a set in  on my mazda again potenzas again because they were decently priced and I decided to try them again. But those ones were just as bad. And Im the kind of guy that rotates every  miles and I have an alignment every few months because of the roads that I drive are terrible. Norfolk But Ive had excellent luck with goodyear eagles falken ze series and cooper zeon although expensive. The falkens were quiet and sticky as a race tire but I only got like  out of them. I try to get a different set of tires every time to just try whats out there though. And I feel like the BF Goodrich Sport Comp s are what Im going for.

9409296,0,t3_59hsck,The    are all Mark  versions of the vehicle so they look pretty much the same. Ill talk about the  model USA since thats what I have and it will be the least expensive for your budget.The S is the standard version. Plaid cloth seats no sunroof etc.The SE adds leather seats sunroof rearview camera fender premium audio automatic headlights and push button start.The Autobahn Edition adds  way power driver seat navigation and dualzone climate control with a cooled glove box.Options on all  include  Speed DSG dual clutch automatic with tiptronic and paddle shifters This is the nicest automatic Ive ever driven. It feels more like a manual where you dont operate the clutch yourself which is technically closer to the truth because it uses clutches rather than a torque converter. The shifts are super quick and its faster than the manual because of that. BiXenon headlights with adaptive front lighting system These headlights increase visibility drastically. The also swivel as you turn the steering wheel to help you see around corners better. There is also a side light that illuminates when you go to make low speed turns which is one of my favorite features because it lights up that dark side road as you start turning towards it which is otherwise invisible. Works great on my cul de sac too! LED daytime running lights These are the cool looking squarish LED lights. These an the xenon lights came on my car bundled as a lighting package. Front Collision Warning System This gives you a warning when the car detects an impending collision in the form of a picture and a noise. It doesnt break for you its basically just saying HEADS UP! when you arent paying attention and you are about to rear end someone so you can hit the breaks yourself. This has helped me out greatly twice since Ive owned the car. Park Distance Control This feature is awesome for parking. Ever get out of your car to check how much distance you have behind or in front of you while you are parallel parking? I do. This gives you a visual indication of how close objects are in front of and behind your car. like so  This is another one of my favorite features.Thats about it!Edit Oh and the performance package adds about hp bigger brakes and a limited slip differential. Whether its worth it depends on the person I guess. On the  models it now comes with the SE and Autobahn editions apparently so that could maybe savce some money there.,GolfGTI,d98p03j,6,t5_2tzrn

9654795,0,t3_5da0e0,I had the insert on my  Golf. It made a HUGE difference on that car with the AT it had. It introduced a tad of vibration especially in reverse or at very low RPM. Nothing bad though and it gave made a slightly more aggressive incabin sound when accelerating.I have a  GTI now and the DSG is a vastly better trans that already shifts very crisply I am on the fence about installing it on my GTI but likely will anyway. Its easy to remove if I decide I dont like it.One thing I have seen confusion on is the torque spec for the bolt. The  Motorsport guide says one value I think nm and people report installing it at another value I think nm.As far as that dogbone insert goes if you have ramps or jack stands a breaker bar a torque wrench proper sized socket and about  mins of time you can do it. Its literally one bolt that comes out pop the insert in and retorque the bolt. It is really very very easy definitely dont be intimidated. A word of advice place the car in neutral when doing it and having installed and removed it you will want the car to be in neutral especially before removing it so there is no load on the motortrans and no pressure on the torque arm.Heres why aka dont F up like I did lol When I drove up the ramps to uninstall it from my Golf before getting my GTI torque was placed on the motor and trans and I didnt put it into neutral when I got up there  didnt even think to because I hadnt when I first installed it on jack stands. When I removed the bolt everything shifted forward  which freaked me out because it wouldnt budge and go back. After calling a friend who had large pry bar and trying with him to shift everything back far enough there was just no way. We were both thinking WTF are we going to do! Then he said wait is the car in neutral. Nope. Sure wasnt. I started it threw it in neutral and everything was gravy we were able to shift everything back into place quite easily.,GolfGTI,da35kjx,1,t5_2tzrn

9884646,0,t3_5gwnf5,Start with Truecar and it will give you a ballpark of what the ranges of offers that the dealers have in your area. Once you get the ranges you can call each of them and see what the best pricing they want to offer is.Depending on how much time you have you can go into each of them and see who offers the best deal but you probably wont get more than an extra  off at that point. Just remember that  cars are depreciating time bombs and  the dealer is selling a commodity where they can only compete on price. You have all the power in the negotiation and dont feel pressured to get a shittier deal.  Im in market too and located in Bay Area. November had K off MSRP. Hoping December will be at least that and also a little more off since its VWs fiscal year end. Also the way the VW dealers negotiate are More off MSRP but you have to do their standard financing terms  for at least  month. They will say you have to have their loan at least  months but at least in California you can legally refinance the loan the day after you leave the lot and dont have to pay the terms for  months. Incentive financing the . you referenced but you wont get as much off MSRP  they usually add K to their lowest price.If you do the math it generally works out to the same cost at the end of  years. Dealers gotta make their money too. ,GolfGTI,davzre2,1,t5_2tzrn

10000454,0,t1_dbaxvud,This is a US spec car assuming you are talking about experiences in the UK. It does sound like your things work better than mine or at least the situations you drive in are easier for the systems to interpret. I dont think we get Google Maps at least not according to the VW CarNet site which doesnt list the US as an available country for that feature. Im sure Park Pilot can be silenced but it comes up all the time when Im not parking its not something I want to be silencing constantly on my commute. Also one thing I forgot and again maybe yours is different but I can from a vehicle that had a steering line overlay on the backup camera which the Golf does not but it does have some moving steering lines on the black and white ParkPilot display where it shows the sensors which I cant understand the benefit of. What do steering lines offer when you cant see anything? Here is the display I have.Also on that topic the camera is really low quality in my opinion. Ive had numerous cars with backup cameras but the resolution and overall usefulness of this one is quite low. Again putting the bending steering lines on the backup camera would be much more useful than putting them on the sensor display where they serve no purpose other than letting you know if you are moving toward or away from an obstacle... which is fairly obvious anyway.I do appreciate the tip about turning off the distance warning that is something I did not see. As for the voice control options I do not see those in my vehicle. I have the Discovery manual here and looked through the menus in car and have the option to disable the short tones indicating I can begin speaking but I do not see anything allowing me to adjust the rest of the things such as what it repeats back or how quickly. Adaptive cruise control is a feature that is great if it works no doubt. For me to use it and feel comfortable I have to trust it that its well designed and safe and with what I see I dont feel that way with this car. My previous car also had ACC and I used it every day driving to work like you said its great but this system is not at the same level.The annoying part is in the US these werent options the car was just one way for  with the only option being DSG or Manual. DAP was standard stuff. Like you I would have avoided certain parts if possible mainly Nav lane assist and the auto high beams. I still want something like ParkPilot and parking sensors I just had expectations of a better version.,GolfGTI,dbb36a7,1,t5_2tzrn

10752409,0,t1_ddolivo,unutzey pretty much summed it up better than I could. But I love it as well. I had a Forge Twintake for about  minutes before I got annoyed with it. It was really loud all the time and made me feel like I was driving a jet. The Cobb CAI almost sounds stock but when you get on it a little bit you can hear it. Its exactly how I imagined an intake to sound. The Accessport is also great took me about  minutes to tune my car and had no problems with it after that. Overall I will say that it was a great purchase combo and am definitely looking forward to buying the dp and catback.Also the Cobb support is PHENOMENAL. I purchased the intake by itself first on accident. When I got it I realized I had forgotten to buy the AP and would have to pay full price for both items instead of the bundle. I contacted them telling them my mistake and with no questions asked they mad me a coupon for the  dollar difference and gave me a  military discount on top. So I have had great experiences with them so far and will continue to stay loyal to them. edit as you can see I did drop one of my screws for the top of the intake box and cant find it...the screws are really small lol. ,GolfGTI,ddp11im,1,t5_2tzrn

11485829,0,t3_63uyxo,It seems Im not the only person debating between the GTI and ST I just finished driving both this afternoon. I was very much biased towards the Focus going into the test drives but came away giving the GTI a much harder look. I do need to go find a manual transmission GTI to drive as the only ones the local dealer had were DSG and I wasnt very impressed with it. I also need to go find a different ST to drive as the one I looked at was a ST and I want to see if I like the base model seats better.

But yes VW always had lots of small issues. They seem to stem from their design philosophy of more modern technologies and new ideas.

11546339,0,t1_dg12h1q,Results everything is fine.  Here is a list of what I had the dealership check and what they said about it Rapid clicking noise from behind the dash when turning onoff the engine this is the HVAC flapper. Its completely normal just louder in some cars.  Sometimes the flapper breaks in which case youd know something is really wrong.  It sounds like someone banging on a door.  Definitely not the case. Theres nothing wrong here. Rough engine idle what youre feeling is normal too. The timing and engine mounts are fine. There is no evidence of carbon build up but it doesnt mean there isnt any.  There might be some in there but if there is its nothing to worry about.  If it gets bad the engine will misfire and itll register a code.  Thats the time to worry about it.  Continue to use high octane top tier fuel if you can find it and the engine likes fast highway driving at higher RPM.  What youre feeling at startup is just several pumps working to circulate fluids around as the engine warms up.   Stuttering in st gear below k RPM couldnt recreate the situation.  Maybe its just because its a warm day  degrees.   Bumpy ride at mph drove it around and it seemed normal just like all the other GTIs they drive.  Took it on the highway.  Yes its bumpy but thats due to the thin wheels and stiff suspension.  Just to be thorough they checked the condition of the suspension and the wheels.  Everything is in great shape.,GolfGTI,dg4s333,1,t5_2tzrn

11668988,0,t1_dginwyb,You will have that same problem all over the car that rubberized paint sucks. I covered mine up with vinyl wrap but its didnt come out as well as Id hoped. When you disassemble it the letters come out but theres no good way to handle the wrap edges on those round holes for the letters. I would recommend trying the spray paint or plastidip instead. You can rub the remaining rubberized coating off with your fingers to strip it before painting. You can paint the part surrounding the ash tray while you are at it.Edit Here are some pictures of how my wrap came out sorry its a bit dustydirty ,GolfGTI,dgip1nw,1,t5_2tzrn
