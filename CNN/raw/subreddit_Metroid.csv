264703,0,t3_1wx1rd,Ive read through this thread now and I think youre still trying to look at this from the wrong perspective. The environment isnt going to give you exact details about the lore like a cutscene would but is giving you hints and clues as to what happened. You see a dead body of something you didnt kill would suggest something else did. If an area looks similar in architecture to that of the chozo it was probably built by the chozo. The main thing to remember is that nothing is drawn out for you or says this area of the map was where the space pirates built a laboratory. Its all done in subtle details.I would suggest actually reading some lore and going back and playing the game again.

1079999,1,t3_26gqno,I could honestly care less about strong female character theory or this persons opinion of it.Page  She spells humans wrong. She puts all media into a single category and strawmans it. She implies that everyone shares the same opinion on what a strong female character should look like.Page  She claims there is a difference between sexy and sexualized but doesnt say what it is. In reality there is no difference. If a creator makes a character that is sexy that character is sexualized by definition. It doesnt make a difference whether its subtle or overt. Also lol at male gaze.Page . She spells heroes wrong. Her personal preferences somehow qualify as a critique of media i.e. Why cant everyone be more like Del Toro? Apparently going topless is an immediate disqualifier for being a strong female character.Page  I agree that people would rather see complex humanized characters instead of the usual archetypes. Of course this is true for male characters just as well as female characters. Itd be nice if she would clarify what she means by mainstream media.Page  Shes selfish. All media must appeal to ME!

Theres almost no experimentation with turning different beams on or off for varied effects.

1377725,0,t3_29tm6b,Uh lets see. Dont really have any theories that Im particularly dedicated to so lets see what kind of halfassed crazy can I come up with. In every Metroid game chronologically after Zero Mission Ridley isnt actually there at all. The real Ridley died on Zebes and Ridley as seen in Metroid Prime and onwards is entirely in Samus head as a representation of her grief and desire to atone for being unable to protect her parents from him. In Metroid Prime  Admiral Dane was originally supposed to be Adam Malkovich and it wouldve been part of? the origin story on how he and Samus first met. After Metroid Fusion the Galactic Federation Marines are about to get a whole hell of a lot more dangerous. Remember the GFed hardware team did reverseengineer nearly half of Samus arsenal including the Plasma Beam though she absorbs it via CoreX before they can ship it out for download after all so whats keeping them from retrofitting said arsenal for their own soldiers to use? On the topic of Fusion the reason we havent gotten a sequel to it is because said sequel might very well have to portray Samus in a more antiheroic role what with the Federation being implied to have it out for her after BSLs destruction. Nintendo having traditionally heroic protagonists likely wouldnt go for a story thats morally grey.,Metroid,ciozfby,2,t5_2rrd6

As a result shes more likely to walk into doors as they open.The physics have been adjusted its a little off but suitless maridia is supposdely easier and makes low hi jump a possible category for PAL only.Because of the adjusted physics some speedrun tricks are not doable or are harder.For some reason phantoons patterns are differentOther roooms have different enemy placement.Theres a lot more but yeah PAL version isnt very well liked.,Metroid,cj1297m,6,t5_2rrd6

Zero Mission is the best of the D Metroids hands down in my opinion anyway. It took a lot of lessons from Super Metroid and improved upon them. Super Metroid is when Nintendo was learning how to do the Metroid formula Zero Mission is when Nintendo tempered and refined it.Granted a lot of it will be up to preference or nostalgia but there are a couple things the Zero Mission is objectively better at than Super Metroid such as graphics and controls and I believe there is roughly the same amount of content.

1584745,0,t3_2cegg8,I was actually thinking about this a little while ago. Nearest thing I could come up with is that as per the ending of Fusion mentions the Federation investigates what happened.That leads to them ultimately putting her and Adam on trial for the destruction of the B.S.L. research laboratory. The true purpose behind that is to attempt to detain her and the Fusion Suit long enough to try and extract trace genomes buried inside her DNA  all of the major creatures that the X killed and copied perfectly and she in turn absorbed.She and Adam would be found guilty and their punishment declared separately  cryogenic freeze for roughly a decade for Samus quarantine and purging by the remaining Aurora Units for Adam. The main man behind this venture is the Mysterious Speaker we saw briefly in Fusion.Fast forward that decade and Samus is awakened by automated systems  to find the Federation in ruins their attempts worked out too well and now not only has Ridley been brought back yet again so too have the Space Pirates the X now mimicking half the known worlds and several other enemies short of the SAX and the Metroids  for reasons unknown attempts to bring back Metroids failed without SR or similar breeding grounds to grow and no SAX would materialize despite access to replicated weaponry.The only reason she hasnt been killed in cryo is that the Icebox facility where she was put to rest and the resurrection facilities where all this spiraled out of control were kept on opposing ends of the Federation controlled galaxy in part to minimize scrutiny of what was being done and the team behind it was very very small. Most died before the X could turn them.Now she has to try and put a stop to a threat every bit as dangerous as the Ing and Phaaze melded into one before the very threat she feared a decade earlier ensures the complete eradication of sentient life throughout the universe.,Metroid,cjexgyo,7,t5_2rrd6

2013467,0,t1_ckvs8xk,Id have to find all the infowhich could take a long while. I was doing this on an old forum. We were using some power stats that were given from Metroid Hunters then comparing them to damage dealt by each weapon including the base power beam. We could then estimate the amount of power a single Power Beam shot would have and use information from Super Metroid to calculate the power multiplier given by each beam upgrade to really get into how much raw power Samus was putting out. Then we could of course compare that to what Ridley Mother Brain and others were doing. Then of course there is Ridley in the official Metroid manga quite easily mutilating mountains and tearing through spaceships like paper that gives one an idea of Metroid universe power levels. If youre familiar with Warhammer k Metroid universe tech would sit in the low end of that with Samus herself fitting in around the middle spot.If I can manage to find all that Ill post it. The point is that even Ridleys mouth beam is much much more powerful than that the force generated by the ship being taken down and the Metroid Prime thing is just laughable. ,Metroid,ckvtifz,1,t5_2rrd6

That isnt to say that the two styles are interchangable.  The designers have to pay attention to the idea that some things only work in D and some only in D.  I think thats what made Metroid Prime so amazing.  Retro were able to retain the feel and aesthetic of Metroid while still recognizing that making it firstperson and D means different kinds of enemies and puzzles.Of course I dont have a problem with Nintendo trying things with the franchise.  As long as the game is focused on isolation exploration and finding powerups that open up new areas it will still feel like a Metroid game it doesnt matter where or even when it takes place.,Metroid,co8ueqq,1,t5_2rrd6

The gameplay however was really good IMO the things they took from Metroid were amazing however the part of the game filled with is it Ninja Gaiden? Took away much of what makes Metroid great and replaced it with something else.

You were entirely capable of returning to the planet afterwards so what was the point? Were reinforcements coming? Did she leave the oven on?The multiplayer was spectacular however and I enjoyed it quite thoroughly. It was like a portable version of Quake! It also did a lot of lore building for the franchise something it in my opinion did better than Other M. The different hunters it introduced were all unique with very different mechanics and it served as a reminder that Samus isnt the only bounty hunter out there. Id love a game that centered around Weavel or a different hunter or Samus more directly compeating with another hunter or maybe one with her on the run and the Federation deploying a hunter to go after her.For the solo mode Other M hands down. But I like Hunterss contribution to the overall Metroid canon more that Other Ms.,Metroid,cq8u6uw,3,t5_2rrd6

You guys complain about backtracking in echoes linearity in fusion and to many dudes in prime . The games are already finished. We dont need to nitpick anymore. Nintendo isnt going to go back and fix those problems and new fans arent going to take your little personal issues into consideration when they play the games. So why are we being so immature about all of this? So we can rank the games like a smash bros tier list? To prove eachother wrong?

3913441,0,t3_359sdu,Id say its definitely the greatest starter game in the series but its exploration elements are severely limited compared to Super Metroid or Prime.

3913667,0,t3_359sdu,It has the classic zones and bosses and its fastpaced controls are sweet as hell so in that regard I agree its a remake of the game that every other D installment is based off of so thats fairly logical. However I do wish that the game was longer as it has become hard for me to NOT beat it within an hour. I also think it should have ended where the original game did the whole Zero Suit escape sequence feels out of place in a game where you otherwise have many different ways to progress and the Ridley Robot is a very underwhelming last boss as it really isnt of any importance.Its definitely the best game to introduce someone to the franchise and I agree in a sense that its the best representation of the franchise since it has all the classic things in it but it does also have its flaws. With that said it is my rd favorite game in the franchise only behind Super and Prime so I do still love it its easily the game Ive played the most in the series because of how easy it is to pick up.Also it seems that there is a lot of praise for Fusion in this thread and while its good it does suffer from a fair share of problems a lot of them being in common with many of Other Ms flaws actually.

4039907,0,t3_36q2zt,A whole lot of great comments here which I mostly agree with.  Isolation and playerdirected exploration are major requirements for the series.Isolation manifests in Metroid in a few ways.  From an atmosphere perspective youre totally by yourself in a hostile environment.  Its not like Zelda where you transition from the civilized areas of towns and shops to the dangerous wilderness and dungeons where youre on your own.  Metroid takes place entirely in hostile territory.  Sure there are save rooms and rooms with no enemies... but these arent civilized places.  Theyre more like tiny hiding spaces in a dangerous labyrinth.Theres also the gameplay side of isolation which is the lack of guided objectives.  Most games nowadays give you fairly explicit instructions for this is where you go next and all you do as a player is deal with the obstacles along the way.  Theres nothing wrong with this  it lets you make a more cinematic game  but after a while it can feel like youre just doing someone elses list of chores instead of being a hero on your own.  The best Metroid games do away with that.  Since you arent on the radio with mission control all the time figuring out where to go next is a puzzle for the player to solve just like beating a boss or finding a secret item.  The Prime games do give you objective markers but you can turn them off.  This is true even in Fusion which is often criticized for its linearity.  Yes Adam gives you objectives... but as the game progresses youre frequently trapped in situations where your path to the next objective or navigation room is cut off leaving you to figure out your next move on your own.  The game reinforces this with the narrative by teasing early on that Adam might not be trustworthy and by introducing some tension when you get upgrades that Adam didnt expect.Horror is also an important part of Metroid.  Its not immediately obvious but just about every Metroid game has some kind of horrorish segment.  The wrecked ship in Super the pirate hideout in Prime a bunch of parts of Fusion...  Horror goes great with an explorationbased game because it makes you just a bit nervous to open each new door.Finally exploration and backtracking are the classic Metroid design tropes.  Revisiting old areas makes the world feel like a real place instead of a hallway full of onetime scripted events.  Whenever you enter a new room you might see a weird symbol or a strangelyshaped wall and think I bet theres something cool hidden in this room but I might not be able to find it yet.  That builds up anticipation and creates playerdriven goals  you want to keep going through the game not because some NPC gave you an objective but because you want to see whats behind that wall.  However theres a right way and a wrong way to do backtracking.  If you look at a map of the critical path through Super Metroid  the basic path to beat the game without using speedrun tricks  youll notice that while you frequently cross your path you dont spend all that much time actually retreading it.  A welldesigned Metroidvania game is built as a series of loops and shortcuts letting you revisit old areas with new abilities without going back and forth through the exact same series of rooms.  Theres a Metroidvania called Monster Tale on the DS that completely fails to grasp this concept.  Every time you get an upgrade you have to go all the way to the opposite side of the world to use it unlock a new area and get another upgrade... only to have to retrace your steps all the way back to where you got the first upgrade.  Metroid Prime has a sequence like this  the Boost BallSpace JumpWave Beam sequence that forces you to make the exact same trip through Magmoor and Phendrana  times in a row.  This is such a jarring slog in an otherwise welldesigned map that it makes me suspect it was the result of cut content such as a boss and some more areas in Magmoor.,Metroid,crgs3bn,3,t5_2rrd6

4295079,0,t3_3a5ydz,Thing is its one thing for nintendo to make a side game of a franchise like Links crossbow training which is obviously just a side game that uses assets of TP and its an entire different thing to do a mediocre shooter game that also has a side futuristic sports game and just splat the Metroid name on it maybe put samus on a poster or mention her twice for the sake of fucking it. It has nothing from metroid no creatures that can be seen of no setting or locations its like if it was gonna be its own eshop  game and they said Hey we can maybe say this is metroid and charge !. Its not megaman soccer which even if its ass it has the megaman characters. Its not mario paint which is not a good game but its filled with mario assets and it was innovative.

They nailed the general atmosphere IMO and it ranks up with the Prime series and Super Metroid as far the general feeling goes for me.It had all of the tightened control from Fusion without all of the annoying handholding or linear progression elements linear for a Metroid game anyhow.  There were also quite a few items that were hidden in areas specifically designed for the advanced playerenthusiast each of which required some serious skill in order to acquire them.  Fusion had a couple of things like this but Zero Mission really seemed to embrace both its rootoriginal story and the more advanced read speedrunning fanbase.

Since the Etecoons and Dachoras are meant to be the same ones Samus rescues from Zebes at the end of Super Metroid wouldnt it be cool if in the event that she didnt save them  the ones in fusion would just be X hosts that you kill like every other enemy  and in the end of the game an SAX is what pilots the ship instead?

6604667,0,t1_d02ge2i,It wasnt that different. Gameplay wise it was fairly similar to the classic games. The Prime series was far more different gameplay wise than Other M. Also yes if a game sells horribly and its attacked relentlessly from fans a company would lose faith. Weve seen companies lose faith in game franchises for far less. You must also remember the Metroid series has never been a major seller compared to Mario Pokemon Zelda etc. Those  factors combined will certainly make Ninty very wary about the franchise.FF seems to be a teambased FPS type of game something that has proven fairly popular in recent years. It most certainly is more mainstream than a sidescrolling exploration platformer like the typical Metroid games.,Metroid,d02h76c,1,t5_2rrd6

If anything whoever raised her on Chozo may have manipulated her in to caring MORE about her appearance to encourage her to maintain her human identity. She may have even wore her human identity as a badge of honor showing that despite being a lower life form than the Chozo she was their equal. Could also be an affront to the effort to turn her in to a living weapon in that she has chosen to focus some effort into maintaining something as trivial as her appearance when she could be spending more time trainingworking. Or it could just be something to do during down time. While we only ever see Samus working its impossible that she is literally spending  working but not owning or having access to things or hobbies were familiar with there might not be much to do other than do her hair.,Metroid,d2g4m2y,3,t5_2rrd6

Samus was the focus for a good portion of the subspace emmissary and you fought Ridley as a boss twice. People always used to call it one of Nintendos big three. Mario Zelda and Metroid In game reviews and editorials thats what they always said. You shouldve seen all the Nintendo Power magazines from that time. You couldnt go five pages without at least a slight mention of the Metroid series. But after Prime  released and the well started to dry up people stopped considering Metroid a top . Once other M hit the scene it pretty much became another umbrella to use on a rainy day in Nintendos massive box of dusty umbrellas.

8318269,0,t1_d5hb6lq,Yeah for some of them youre definitely right. Especially the one you mentioned which i believe is in Phendrana. Im pretty sure I walked right past that the first time I played it as im sure everyone else probably did.The world not being built to allow you to find them yourself though im not sure. I think that entirely depends on how often you use the scan visor to be honest. By design the scan visor allows you figure out whether you cancan not access a certain part of the room so if youre in Magmoor Caverns scan the room and see that the center pillar of the room has that scan icon and then notice a crack in it one might be able to deduce that something might be in there. But I dont know maybe thats just Metroidvaniamentality. I cant really say if the average person would even use the scan visor unless required to tbh. So i feel like by having the scan visor it does allow you to find them yourself but if a player never uses it until they need to which might be more common than I may realize then youre ultimately left with being directed by the hints. So i kinda agree with you too there haha,Metroid,d5hc8t9,1,t5_2rrd6

8488738,0,t3_4vstdl,I dont think Id personally want Metroid to be anything like what you stated. Im fine with an expansion on prime but that is what we are already getting. I also disagree that this is a general grab at the Japanese market exclusively. Metroid has always sold better in the U.S. and this tendency towards online gaming both competitively and cooperatively is a worldwide ordeal.I also think there is little to gain from being more like Halo. The way Prime is is the way I like Prime which is why federation force has my favor as far as gameplay. I do NOT want a twitch shooter. Too many games are alike already. Submit to that just because it sells and we lose the charm Metroid has. Im invested in FF because it is colorful the gameplay from what Ive seen is tight and what Ive experienced focuses on satisfying... Fun... Things I expect from Nintendo and quality I expect from Metroid. I was never interested in gritty overly serious FPSs and since CoD and Halo are slowly fading in fandom while the more expressive fantastical experiences are taking the spotlight I dont think another gritty first person shooter is the path Metroid should take. Its clear to see that you favor the Prime series... But I disagree that theres no appeal to side scrollers among the gaming community at large currently Mighty No.  was an immense failure but it had a HUGE following and a lot of exposure to begin with. And just look at that indie market alive and booming with things that arent FPS. The appeal for a platformer is there but you also have to realize that among the current generation of gamers Metroid isnt a household title. We need following and its important to add appeal while not subtracting from its core.Perhaps our views are irreconcilable and thats fine. Perhaps Im wrong on what it will take to make Metroid legitimately profitable thats a good possibility. I know what I want you know what you want and that just isnt the same thing. One of us will eventually lose out and thats just the way the cookie crumbles. But Im only going to vote with my wallet when it comes to my best interests.,Metroid,d62n0v5,1,t5_2rrd6

Actually I think Ultima Underworld may have had journal pages laying around too but not sure. Gradually unlocking new weapons  dates back to Metroid  used by every single video game since then. Being locked in a room until you kill all the enemies  dates back to Zelda  if I recall correctly. Level design  no Doom game really fits the Metroid style.

8653275,0,t1_d6n47w8,You can sue anonymous people. You can even sue animals and inanimate objects thats how civil forfeiture works. Back when companies were dumb enough to engage in legal action against dedicated fans record labels would launch John Doe lawsuits in order to subpoena ISPs for the physical whereabouts of Gnutella users.You see your IP address is assigned to you by an ISP out of their pool of available addresses. It does not identify an individual machine but ISPs do keep logs of which subscribers are assigned to what addresses and those records can be compelled by court order. If you have an IP address a date and some kind of evidence that it was sending copyrighted material you have a case to subpoena those logs.In practice this isnt done anymore. Im not  sure why the recording and movie industries halted their activities but I would imagine it had to do with the incredibly negative optics of the situation. Copyright laws are designed as industrial regulation and as such the penalties are quite severe. The result was some really bad press not only were the logs sometimes wrong but in many cases the account holders werent even the ones doing the infringement. And the few people who did fight back generated all sorts of negative press since up until a few months ago actually!.The courts themselves disliked the enormous amount of new copyright litigation and the harsh punishments but they cant actually do anything as all of that is legal and constitutional no matter how unfair it is.Now there are further ways to anonymize yourself such as using someone elses network connection or Tor to distribute the files. However the era of mass copyright lawsuits has ceased and the only people who get hauled in court are people who are running pirate torrent sites. So its more of a hypothetical for people who arent big enough to become a manual target of an investigation. However if you are a target its far harder to hide yourself now than it was back then. At this point its less about anonymization technology as it is just proper intelligenceagency tradecraft.I should note that this is still a hypothetical though  Nintendo has no interest in prosecuting fan works beyond sending out the occasional takedown. That being said its difficult to hide yourself from the law. Lets look at say Silk Road operator Dread Pirate Roberts aka Ross Ulbricht. He operated an illegal drug marketplace through Tor. He was caught due to a number of incredibly stupid mistakes such as. Asking PHP questions relating to the particular Bitcoin setup used on Silk Road... on Stack Overflow with his regular email address.. Talking about it on social media granted Google to friends.. Shitposting on forums using fake names from his regular IP address to plug the site.. The default error pages on his website handing out the nonanonymized IP address of his server. Administering his website from a coffee shop where he was ultimately arrested. Notably the guy thought he could shut off his encrypted laptop before the cops took it away.So yeah if someone wants to actually find you they can find you. You dont even need the legal power of the government to do it most of the doxings of the past few years have happened through information available on social media found by incredibly obsessive horrible people.Oh and yes if you were perfectly anonymous the court would not be able to serve any defaultsummary judgment caused from you not showing up at court.

8662713,0,t1_d6odzha,Personally Im against the removal of anything largely because NoA in the past has stripped Path of Radiance of its hardest difficulty and removed something like  of the text from an expanded script that was available on normalhard mode from Radiant Dawn.So Im kinda sick of them removing anything from the games. It extends beyond the petting thing though they actually removed swimsuits too. Which sounds fine until I add that one of the swimsuits was an ingame reward for something theres simply no reward for now.The other swimsuits removed costed resources which are randomly assigned to your save files castle  and were some of the highestcost items. So if you have a castle with X resource where X had a swimsuit attached to it but thats now gone then that resource is just less valuable now theres less you can buy with it.Not a huge deal still but it doesnt seem very well thoughtout or implemented. The hot springs still exist for one. Plus the character Sophie along with a class of weapon have an ability that actually strips foes of their armor leaving them in underwear thats just as skimpy as many of the outfits removed and that was left in. So its OK to forcibly remove somebodys clothes but not for them to choose to wear something like that.But yeah Ive gone on a bit long about this.

The main thing thats missing in the Wii version is scan dashing which Id really call more of a speed technique than a glitch. The only real issue is a couple of rooms that would sometimes freeze the game if you boost ball through them but Ive never had that occur when playing the GCN version on the Wii. Otherwise I dont think youre any more likely to get stuck in the GCN version unless youre actually trying to get out of the map or something.

9727054,0,t3_5eez7j,I love both mods equally though for different reasons. Eris  is certainly the more challenging game though a lot of the challenge comes from things that arent necessarily fair. The Botwoon room in Eris  is a complete load of crap and I dread fighting it every time I play the hack for example. There were a lot of other weird balance changes like removing a hell of a lot of Super Missiles that were available in the  edition and delaying the Evasion powerup until after its most useful which makes Botwoon and Spore Spawn a fucking test of patience let me tell you. This is all to say that I love it though I personally wouldnt go into it without savestates.Hyper Metroid on the other hand is a much more balanced game and the frustrations in it stem from a lack of direction coupled along with some powerful enemies that generally let you know youre moving in the wrong direction. However I find it a much more fun game than Eris  and because it was developed on top of Project Base another mod that fixes up some of Super Metroids weird quirks such as a lack of respin not maintaining momentum when landing from a jump space jump controls etc its a lot of fun to play. Its also much more nosavestate friendly which would benefit someone playing on a cartridge.Personally Id get Hyper Metroid.

11262819,0,t3_602av4,I agree that gameplay is a pretty huge aspect of the Metroid series. However I feel that while gameplay should be strong the story should be strong as well rather than the whole gameplay first story second thing. I do however agree that we dont need an explanation as to why Samus doesnt have her items. But in terms of story I feel Retro Studios has already set a precedent for story driven Metroid games and if the next game were to be a Prime game I feel it would only make sense to have the story be a huge part of the game. Also its worth noting that Other M had nice gameplay for the most partthanks in part to Team Ninja but the story was abysmal and ruined the Metroid feel of the game more than the games linearity. Maybe its because I grew up playing the Prime games which were so story driven. Its not to say that the game SHOULD have a huge amount of time and work put into the story the D games barely had any as you said but it shouldnt really be just a second thought either.,Metroid,df8mh32,1,t5_2rrd6

11316019,0,t1_dfenclq,Lock on makes for easy to approach v dueling which is made better by the side step dodge. Timing dodges and charge beams appropriately while reading enemy lunges and ranged attacks is simple but incredibly compelling especially during boss encounters like Ridley where dodging and charge shots are really key to surviving. Basically the mechanics complement each other and control appropriately with visual indication for enemy actions and plenty of choice for the player especially if you count the super beam weapons.,Metroid,dfenhyr,8,t5_2rrd6
11319130,0,t1_dfezqrq,In Super Metroid all of Samus beams and Missiles were almost as fast as her Speed Booster and Shine Spark. In fact her fastest weapon in the game is the Super Missile which is much faster than the Speed Booster. Missiles are also very fast. So I dont know what youre talking about when you said that Missiles are slower in the D games.Prime  was definitely the most linear. I enjoyed it a bit during my first playthrough but dont like it anymore. It doesnt feel like Metroidvania to me. The Missiles in that game are SO nerfed its unbelievable. Like seriously can the Missiles move any slower!? A single Missile cant even break open the health crates in that game. Pathetic!,Metroid,dff06bf,3,t5_2rrd6

11801734,0,t3_674eu2,I think its time for a true advancement in the Metroid series.Something post Fusion.The issue is Nintendo clearly doesnt know where to head with the series... So I think what should be done is working WITH what theyve got so far. And what is that?In the latest of the timeline the last two games The federation has a sect of it that isnt playing so nice with things they should be. They want to build illegal weapons but somethings a bit off about it I find and its a fairly important question.Why?Whats the intent of using Space Pirates and Metroids as weapons? who are they intending to use them on? why isnt the normal big bombs and weapons they use sufficient? The next games coming should explore this perhaps route out the cause of this Shadow group in the federation dabbling in illegal activities.But how SHOULD it go? I sincerely doubt Nintendo is going to let Metroid have human enemies to shoot at so whats the best route to go?Heres the pitchMother Brain returns!!But how? theres no way that after Super Metroid shes going to survive and how does she relate to anything the Federations been doing?Well Ive got plasuable inuniverse reasons to explain BOTH! And in a way to tie all the damn series together Prime and standard metroid at least in Lore.So primary issue how does Mother Survive?Physically? she doesnt. Her body perishes on zebes theres nothing to rebuild there from. However it is important to remember that she is an organic SUPER COMPUTER and a Telepathic one at that. If shes a computer even if organic she SHOULD be able to move her mind somewhere else.... But where?Well Metroid Prime  established that the Galactic Federation has ORGANIC SUPERCOMPUTERS called Aurora Units runnings whole planets and star ships. Ones that are fundamentally not to different than Mother Brain in promotional material ones facitility looked like a parralel to Tourian. Morever these or Aurora Units form a Wireless network that spends the galaxy they are in constant communication with each other. Question Whats stopping Mother Brain from tappinghacking into this network and uploading her mind and memories too it?Say.. taking over a certain blackops secret facilities Aurora unit?And say say.. slowly changing the unit to have her telepathic abilities..And say say say that she is now using these abilities to influence the decisions of this group to follow her whims?I mean think about it.. Other M and Fusion the Feds are effectively trying to recreate and improve MOTHER BRAINS WEAPONS OF CHOICE! Shit they themselves have deemed illegal and hired a certain someone to eradicate on multiple occasions..Cyborg Space Pirates could be her attempt at building a better Space Pirate Force.Iceproof Metroids so Samus cant stop them.X Parasites for a ceaseless self replicating army.A humanoid frame with all her abilities for increased mobility over her old sluggish body.Bosses could return using a combination of robots and either Mother Brains Telepathy or the Federations Hologram technology.. I mean have a fight with Ridley only to at the  mark for its hologram projector to bust revealing a Terminator style roboridley underneath or as you get closer to Mother Brain she afflects you telepathically and makes an apparition of Dark Samus that seems real enough to Samus during the fight maybe again revealing a mechonized foe underneath it perhaps this one themed after a Golem.The game could take place on a previously federation controlled world. The events of Fusion and Other M causes Mother Brain the actual not her prototype body that is MB to come out of hiding because she doesnt want her plans to slowly fall through at the hands of Samus again. She chases the Federation Forces heh living on the planet offworld but even as reinforcements comes in the world converts into an even larger deadlier version of the Doomseye complete with armada blocking shield.By the time Samus arrives on this planet to deal with it its virtually abandoned everyone either dead or escaped or maybe survivors their for her to rescue.But even with the Transformation Federation Cities and facilaties could remain intact that leaves Samus with a completely different type of environment to explore thats yet to be done on the series.. a Modern civilized location of the Feds. Have a City that but days ago thriving with people now lay in ruins to be explored.Bonus points if the game goes the way of Breath of the Wild and takes from the Open Air Formula and game engine and scales the games and Samus movement abilities to fit accordingly such as the space jump or speed booster.New enemies can be Federation styled bots or even AI controlled Golems from Federation force along side mainstays that the federation had been Collecting breeding and augmenting such as Pirates Metroids and other classic metroid species and more.If the game is using the Open Air style massive roaming bosses and enemies could be used. Say like an automated Federation Scout shipdrone or even massive enemies that you have to FIGHT on them.If Nintendo wants to have Samus return to her classic armor easily explained by just having her briefly state in the openning that she Visited some friends to fully restore her armors plating.. while having silluettes of the Luminoth in the background.I dont know if any of you who might have read all that has noticed.. but what Im trying to do with this idea is have the series MOVE FORWARD by BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER in a way feasable for Nintendo to keep classical enemies have a story that makes sense of the Federations activities of late and call back to as many metroid games as possible while being new at what it does.Metroid is one of the VERY few titles where its kind of one big continous story instead of a whole new seperate and unrelated incident with different incarnations of set pieces and characters each time Like with all its other series. but theyve been struggling trying to put it all together and continue it.,Metroid,dgxrn0u,2,t5_2rrd6
