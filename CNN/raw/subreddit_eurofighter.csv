It is sold as a partially stealthy fighter characterised by being called a generation . aircraft. An issue with selling a stealthy generation  aircraft is that the term stealthy for that aircraft design has a fixed point in history. It is a selling point with a sale by date. The F is being sold on its stealth at a time when stealth of its kind is becoming less effective. Yes it will always be as stealthy as it is but opposing defences and combined defensive structures will prevent stealth fighters operating as the were designed to. Radars of varying frequency are combined in operation to bring defensive measures within visual range of a stealth aircraft. That by the understanding of readily available IRST systems is km. So you send a stealth aircraft in it is detected as on its way triangulated to an approximate position and engaged visually. It will be carrying limited payload and will not be in a position to retaliate as was thought possible a decade ago. The stealth fighter may as well be a smaller profiled higher performance generation . aircraft with decent countermeasures and a useful number of short range missiles. The defensive engagement will be the same. If a stealth aircraft ever turns its back on surviving generation  aircraft it will be detected by IRST and engaged BVR with missiles using near on unjamable visual aircraft recognition same as any other fighter. The F will be very useful in its ground attack role against second rate opposition. Its stealth will assist in its survival markedly. But changing the majority of the US Air Force to Fs will be fraught with lost effectiveness from reliance on dated stealth strategy. In a radar compromised environment a pilot will get closer to the enemy before detection using a Gripen. Theyre smaller colder and therefore harder to spot. And when a Gripen turns for home it will be able to leave the scene as fast as the pursuing fighters. The F is an effective design reference US fighter operations in the last  years. Over the next  years aircraft use will come down to what tech they can carry. Whichever side carries the best missiles and countermeasures into battle will win. And those countermeasures will have to be active not passive. The Eurofighter starts off quite stealthy then has a huge nose for decent radar upgrades. After that it saves on door opening times and gun firing times fires missiles at high speed adapts well to new missile applications and flies like an angel. It has significant engine power upgrades and vectored thrust ready to afford and its agility is proven by trial  to be significantly upgradable at small cost. Whilst the USA has been working to achieve the F design Europe has been plodding along with development of its Euro Cannards. The Eurofighter Rafale and Gripen have very quietly been becoming very attractive purchase options indeed. All fighters develop as costs allow developing aircraft suited to those smaller budgets and upgrade expectations. From the road ready Gripen to the carrier capable Rafale to the thoroughbred Eurofighter options are now on the table for any countries fighter needs and budget as never before. European fighter supply has grown in the way its civil aircraft supply has with superbly engineered and attractive products. The USA is being bogged down by the F so much so personnel involved in the project are being instructed how to respond to media questions with a more upbeat stance. ,eurofighter,cvdn912,1,t5_34o4m
