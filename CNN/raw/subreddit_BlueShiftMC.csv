3482653,0,t1_cpp4cxl,If were going to change up some recipes for modtweaker could we ore dict forestry honey drops with Pams honey and possibly growth crafts honey as well? Either that or add a recipe to convert one version of honey to the other. I really dont want to have to have  different versions of honey while trashing the large stash of Forestry honey Ill have.,BlueShiftMC,cpp8xlq,1,t5_37dw5
3498637,0,t1_cppsduy,Dragon Mounts is a cool mod and I would not mind have it in the pack but as a side note from my experience a few versions back the Dragons did use to break blocks like the normal End Dragon so if we do end up adding it we may have to be super careful.,BlueShiftMC,cpr2jaj,1,t5_37dw5
