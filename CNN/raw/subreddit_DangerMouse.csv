6710103,0,t3_3rob3l,I wonder whats going on with the character? I mean I understand this could be a multiverse where our dear old Duckyboos could be not related at all with this  counterpart but Id like to think this is indeed related.Ive always imagined the old Count Duckula from Danger Mouse s show as the father of DuckyboosIf that was the case then who is this new C.D. ?I dont think hes Duckyboos son as it hasnt passed  years for Igor to resurrect him if he happened to die somehow Dr. Von Goosewing? Naaahhh... nope...I imagine this new C.D. is actually our beloved Count Duckula the vegetarian one.Maybe he has accepted his fate of being the villian and maybe Igor helped him somehow and now he can turn townsfolk into vegetables. This vegetarian references make this count the actual Duckyboos with a new attitude Igor wouldnt repeat the Ketchup mistake again!What do you think about this theory?Please comment something THANKS!,DangerMouse,d0ddro2,1,t5_2rt11
