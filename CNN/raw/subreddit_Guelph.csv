1725968,0,t1_cjwnds7,Mostly true! Cities can regulate their use with different bylaws as Toronto did when it said that ebikes can only use bike lanes if the operator is pedalling without motor assistance. They used the bylaw that regulates bike lanes and multiuse paths to do itBicycle lanes and park paths are governed by City of Toronto bylaws not the Highway Traffic Act. City of Toronto bylaws state that a bicycle cannot be propelled by a motor when using multiuse trails or bicycle lanes. If an electric bicycle is being used on a multiuse path or in a bicycle lane it must be propelled by pedaling alone.Cheers,Guelph,cjwq1ab,2,t5_2qvta

2723135,0,t1_cndk3vq,I commend your efforts engaging police but after hearing this audio session it comes off as just PR to me. I had to laugh at the part where the cop states the times when they are fighting for their lives presumably in the context of the Garner murder carried out by cops. I wont argue there are unfavourable encounters that cops have but we really only get one side of the story. They know full well that at worst if everything goes to hell and someone dies they are investigated by their own....the thin blue line. The cop you interviewed sounded more dismayed by all that paperwork that has to be done.Guelph cops should have mandatory on body cameras that they cannot turn off or interfere with. Not implying cameras will solve all problems but it would sure as hell bring some badly needed accountability to the problem. Also citizens have the right to film cops provided they are not obstructing again mostly at the cops discretion of course. There is one YouTube video involving Guelph police and they tell the individual filming the incident that they are not allowed to do that. The video is a bit older but citizens are completely within their rights to do so. My point here is police intimidation plays a heavy factor. If a cop tells me to stop filming I would move away to let them safely do their job but if I continue to film and no threat to them is apparent other than their obvious discomfort they can go fuck themselves.Again youve done some serious legwork here and I applaud that. Police need to remember they are there to serve the community not harass and intimidate with impunity.,Guelph,cndlxec,2,t5_2qvta

They cleared everyone else out and informed them what was happening. Strange attempted courtesy or something? Then the stench hit us... Spice  was not very good either. Very overpriced and everything was cold. Ive been there for both their buffet as well for take out. Both times it was cold very salty and just terrible. You can get x the food for half the price at Bombay Cafe and it is so much better tasting. Salsateria though the love of my life is hit or miss.

5239949,0,t3_3j7kn4,Hey everyone!    Ive seen a few posts over the past couple months of people looking for jobs in and around Guelph. I just thought Id try and help anyone out that is still looking and if you already have a job but are looking for a change this could be a chance for you as well.     Many of you have heard about Denso an auto parts manufacturer in Guelph well they recently changed their hiring structure. You are not only on contract for  months before being hired on fulltime which includes a raise and full benefits. They have also now begun to offer benefits for contract employees as well. It is not a full coverage plan but it does cover alot of stuff and has life insurance as well.     Contract workers start at . and you are given a safety show voucher. There is also plenty of opportunity to work overtime if you want it.     So if you are in a job that doesnt have any benefits this could work out very well for you.     Now here is the cool part if you are interested and would like an interview having a current employee like myself take your resume to HR almost guarantees you a st interview.     I would be happy to help some people out and if you want to pm me your resumes or pm me so we can have it emailed I will print it off for you and hand it in.     Hopefully if this isnt right for you you know someone who will be interested. Thanks!,Guelph,cvhlqwj,2,t5_2qvta
