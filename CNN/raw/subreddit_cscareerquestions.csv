1053,0,t3_1u45z1,Books are not the solution for everything. You just need to make the effort of talking to people and eventually your anxiety will go away. This will affect your professional life.I used Omegle and after  or so hours of talking to strangers I am now pretty comfortable talking to anybody vs. being a recluse for the past semester or so.

1478,0,t3_1u53s0,Software development and computer scientists in general are fields that have a lot of opportunity for those who are good. There are definitely more software jobs than people to fill them simply because there arent enough qualified people to fill those roles. If youre bad youll be displaced fast. Youll figure it out soon. Sure you can outsource development but most companies have leaned away from that in favor of their own development or more local consulting teams because outsourced code tends to be pretty bad. If you were a bank would you want to outsource your job to another country? Dont you think thats a little... bad? Can you really trust someone elses code? Can you be sure that they can produce exactly what you want? How do you keep communication with someone from India? Once you realize the flaws of outsourcing software jobs you realize the benefits of having someone on site that knows what you really need. I had no trouble finding my internship and I fully expect to get a full time software developer role as soon as I graduate. This is mostly due to my passion for my field and industry. I invest a lot of time outside of school into learning and training. ,cscareerquestions,ceelukx,2,t5_2sdpm

57014,0,t3_1uqrsq,Did you take an internship? That helps a little.Regardless being nervous about that first job and not knowing what to do is normal. Hell I feel that way a bit about every job I take. As a junior dev which I assume youll land yourself in you should find a mentor. The company may try to force one on you but in my opinion the mentee should have a say in who mentors them. Ive had great mentors and terrible mentors in the past. NOTE This story will scare you so dont read it unless you are preparedIve written before around this place about a terrible junior dev we had once. He made up an architectural diagram to pitch and most people were like gee thanks! This is great! I took a look at it and didnt like it so I sat down with him to talk about what I disagreed about the short answer there is he had a core and basic misunderstanding about the MVC design pattern and didnt understand we were moving to a SOA strategy  which can be supported by MVC but he had things like  of the logic in the Controller and using ViewModels exclusively and putting business logic in the Views etc. Anyway  his mentor ended up overhearing our conversation and came to talk with us. The looong story short the mentor yelled at this Junior Dev for  minutes. Not just passionate debating but just screaming at him demanding he show him where he got this design pattern from etc. That guys boss didnt step in to help either. The other bosses watched from a distance and then went home. I was new to the company but walked over and tried to jump in to defend him  the junior dev was absolutely wrong but its poor form to scream for   minutes under ANY circumstance. Eventually even a VP stepped in and this mentor would not shut up. So yes  bad mentors exist. Dont get lumped in with someone like that  learn who YOU want to train you and guide you and learn from who you need to learn from.By the way  yes the mentor was fired shortly after that incident.,cscareerquestions,cekx6ef,5,t5_2sdpm

80428,0,t3_1v0jr6,It probably sounds obvious but I think it depends a lot on your skill level and the effort you put into your career.I know many people who make it seem as if it really is that easy. Some have k job offers lined up before they even graduate. Of course the people who get great offers have to have some combination of skill initiative connections and luckThere are others who have more sobering experiences.  I know many people who spend months after graduating job hunting. One of these guys went to a great university interned at a Big company graduated last year and still cant find a job to this day hes not well connected. A lot of the people spending months job hunting after graduation are less passionate about the field and probably didnt put much effort into their career during college no internships no job hunting etc. I should say a lot of people fall into this category.As for myself I still dont think its all that easy. I secured an internship but it was tough for me. It took a while and I had to apply to a ton of places. I havent graduated yet but Im not taking the postcollege job search for granted Im settings aside some savings to hold me over for a couple months in case I cant find anything right away.I should probably say that the cscareerquestions subreddit obviously leans towards the more ambitious and skilled folks. The stories here will skew towards success stories and Ive found that theyre not indicative of real life results for the average CS student. So is it that easy? Yes it can be.

212093,0,t1_cf2lcvj,The first two weeks were not technical.  We covered topics like the history of the company how the company is structured company policies cultural awareness mostly American vs Indian and what to expect from life as a contractor. Sounds pretty boring and it definitely is at times but still valuable.  The next four weeks were technical.  First week covered HTMLCSSJavaScript. Second week covered basic java stuff think cs. Third week covered more advanced java topics like OOP and jee. Fourth week we had to work as a team to put together a website based on a case study. Naturally everyone had their own level of exposure to these topics so some people would breeze through the lessons and then either dick off or try to learn something new beyond the material and others would spend more time learningworking through material that was new to them. It wasnt too structured more like guided selflearning but the training batch that I was a part of was more structured than the last and the batch after us was split into two groups based on experience so they are actively working on improving training. I really wasnt looking forward to spending  weeks away from home but it wasnt that bad. It made me more confident that I was actually prepared to work in the real world and calmed my fear that I fucked myself over by not pursuing an internship and not spending all my free time coding.

So pick one it can be anyone that offers a CS program. I picked UCF for mine. UCF is an awesome upandcoming university and we have an awesome CS program probably the best in the state to be honest although FSU is a close second. So awesome that Microsoft Google Facebook Texas Instruments to name a few come fly down to Orlando to recruit UCF CS students. Okay well enough about UCF sorry I just love my university and its CS program.Once you pick a university you start tackling the CS requirements. Your first semester is usually where they teach you how to program then the next semester is probably data structures and algorithms. This class took my coding abilities from noob to something else not amazing but it did teach me to code logically. Pick an instate school. Since you live in Florida you probably qualify for instate tuition for me its like k a year which isnt too bad because CS is a field where you can easily get a nice paying career.Go this route OP.

Firstly relax and think whether you really want to get into CSSWProgramming etc. If not sure take couple of online free classes in CS something like algo. See if you enjoy that. If the answer is yes go for Option . With CS Bachelors degree in hand you should be able to clear debt within no time after getting the job.    If you think you are not much into CS math algo analysis programming etc but still like to be in software industry you can choose Option . Get into something like  MIS Management Info systems or like    Remember Option  is tough but made possible by lot of folks.    So most essential point for you is to identify what do you like most.

457291,0,t1_cfs8r8o,ampampamp Lump of labour fallacy sfw gtgtIn economics the lump of labour fallacy or lump of jobs fallacy fallacy of labour scarcity or the zerosum fallacy from its ties to the zerosum game is the contention that the amount of work available to labourers is fixed. It is considered a fallacy by most economists  who hold that the amount of work is not static. Another way to describe the fallacy is that it treats the demand for labour as an exogenous variable when it is not.gtHistorically the term lump of labour originated to rebut the idea that reducing the number of hours that employees are allowed to labour during the working day would lead to a reduction in unemployment. The term has also been used to describe the commonly held beliefs that increasing labour productivity and immigration cause unemployment. Whereas some argue that immigrants displace domestic workers others believe this to be a fallacy arguing that such a view relies on a belief that the number of jobs in the economy is fixed whereas in reality immigration increases the size of the economy thus creating more jobs.  gtInteresting Technological unemployment | Oliver Kamm | Employment | Filthy Lucre Economics for People Who Hate Capitalism Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcfsrje oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecfsrje.

No offense to anybody here but if you cannot or at the very least reason your way through  write code to implement basic data structures understand the difference between and know when to use  different sorting techniques or be able to calculate the BigO of some function then you should probably review some of those topics Especially before you try and work at Google. gt You mention you are still in college.

Im also familiar with students having good Computer Science GPAs but not being able to do anything mentioned above without looking online.

610765,0,t3_212j9n,Im a young whiteish male so take the following as you like. gt but why choose a workplace I know would make me uncomfortable when I could choose one that doesnt by picking another field?Because choosing to be uncomfortable is how we grow and in any case avoiding discomfort is impossible. Im not talking about toxic environments where people actively or passively try to bring you down but uncomfortable jokes the subtle condesension you see mentioned in the other posts etc.Jokes  I understand that they seem to make an issue unimportant and thats liable to piss you off. It would piss me off too if Im trying to seriously discuss something and the people to whom I am talking arent taking it seriously. And sexism definitely deserves to be taken seriously Im  with you on that. But its a heavy subject. A depressing one frankly to think that otherwise intelligent people I respect devalue someone simply because that person is female. So I make jokes because thats one way to bring the subject up into someones mind without getting all heavy and gloomy. Plus a little reductio ad absurdum is a way to show how ridiculous an idea is without directly attacking the specific instance Im bringing attention to. Someone on the defensive usually doesnt change their mind willingly.As I said at the beginning of this post Im male and I acknowledge that this puts me in a certain position of privilege. Im also a foreigner living in one of the most subtly xenophobic countries in the world so I do have an inkling of what its like in the general sense. In the end its still my decision to stand on my merits even if it will take more merit than the person next to me. If I forget about fair of course it isnt it becomes another cost that I weigh against the benefits of living here and in the end I accept it as one I will pay.My choice is to see it as little different than the stigma I have of being the lazy unambitious one in the family of being the one who always misses the plane train or bus it was only ever one of each of being elitist or racist or any number of things Ive had people think about me. Some are justified some were at one time but no longer are others are completely the result of a misunderstanding.Ive also turned away from many choices. Some because I didnt think I had what it took some because I wasnt prepared to bust my balls for what I perceived to be not enough of a reward and some because they made me uncomfortable. One of those Im correcting now by finally learning to program and unrelated take responsibility for my own business and not just someone elses as an employee. I do wish that I had simply bit the bullet ten years ago with regards to CS as a career because I am ready now for where I would have been now had I started then.If thats confusing I simply mean that we tend to compare how we are now to how we need to be later. In hindsight  of the decisions I deferred until I was ready I could have taken them then and by the time I needed some attribute I would have had it. And as a parallel analogy you may well find that by the time youre ready to start your career the sexism that is prevalent will have become much less of an issue. The trend is definitely of an improvement and it seems to be accellerating in recent years.Thus shall I end this wall of text about my choices and some little bit of advice. I hope that it has given you at least some additional information or perspective on the choice that is before you. Whatever you chose I wish you the best.,cscareerquestions,cg9p2uf,1,t5_2sdpm

From the sounds of it you are a decent candidate who has the potential to work at a lot of places.  Sacrificing your happiness to apply a geographical tag on your resume will probably just make you miserable.gt I figure once Im in the bay area it will be a lot easier to get a job at a smaller company since they seem to hire locally for the most part.I think your performance in the interview room and accompanying demonstration of experience is what will get you hired NOT that you happen to currently reside locally.  In my experience companies particularly smaller companies will fight to bring someone they want on board.  Once you fit into the category of we NEED this person your zipcode doesnt really matter.Also people seem to have this idea that smaller companiesstartups will simply grab whoever they can get.  I find the opposite is true hiring stands at startups are very stringent and hold an extremely high bar.  A bad hire at a small company can be absolutely devastating.  When you interview at startups assume you will be walking into a very difficult interview with a very high hiring standard.  For very good reason it can be hard to get hired at startups.  You really need to bring more than just a gpadegree you need to bring a likelihood to move the entire company forward.  Im not saying this applies to you but think about it.Lastly Cisco probably isnt the worst choice of places to come work for.  In the area they are seen as a more corporate tech company with a high rollover and some propensity to lay their employees off.  I think I know...  people that worked got laid off at cisco.

673811,0,t1_cggop7y,Keep in mind that almost no employer will be interested in tracking down your old Internet personas. If they Google your real name theyll generally find LinkedInGithubblogs with your real name on it and not something that you were posting  years ago with a pseudonym.  myself use the same pseudonym on just about every forum except Reddit Ive posted on some with the same name for about  years and while I know those postings can be linked to my real name I would not expect anyone to be interested in that.My suggestion would be to avoid pseudonyms where you see that others are using real names almost exclusively. For instance most large open source projects operate on a realname basis. Sometimes that is actually a formal rule such as in the Linux kernel where you must submit any contributions with your real name. So if youre contributing to a major project real names are the way to go. A place like StackOverflow is very much a mixed bag. It seems that real names are used by the majority of regular contributors but pseudonyms are still common. You could go either way but if you choose a pseudonym obviously make it one that youd be comfortable giving to a prospective employer. Telling your employer to check out github.comspacecoder or github.comcodenaut is fine but pointing to github.compinkrapistelephant would be of dubious value.One big advantage of pseudonyms is that you have some control over who knows the account belongs to you. To the majority its just some guy but you can tell others that its you.And generally as for employers being judgmental regarding your online posts or personas. That is becoming less of an issue I think. People who are  years old are generally too old to have posted stupid stuff online likely werent even using the Internet  years ago. But people who are  and have been using the Internet for the last  years will themselves remember that a teenaged Internet user is not necessarily the pinnacle of intellectual evolution and would be unlikely to judge you unless you truly posted something so stupid that it goes above and beyond.,cscareerquestions,cggv1yh,3,t5_2sdpm

Why would you not want to improve your skills in your chosen career?Part  Your dream is to work at Google. You selfassessed that you need to improve your skills before youd want to apply at Google.Hey everyone needs a dream!  Youll be dead in approx  years and if you dont attempt your dream youll regret it while laying on your deathbed ie youll be telling yourself Oh man why didnt I even try?Your Stated Problem You want to work at a place that has a high bar for hiring and you think youre not good enough so youve devised a plan to make yourself a better candidate.Your Actual Problem You are asking the internet to tell you its ok for you to improve yourself and apply for your dream job.Why are you asking us when its clear you already know what you want to do and how to go about doing it?  Just go do what you want to do.  You dont need anyones permission.PS actual advice theres nothing bad that can happen by learning more about development and interviewing at Google.

Virtually no sophomore is going to have experience on a project that comes close to what gets done in the work environment.  Employers also know this  its an internship after all not a entrylevel position.  Your focus should be not how much skill you already have but your potential to be a smart person who gets stuff done.Tech companies have internships because they want to tap into and attract talent early on.  If they can convince you to work for them when you graduate they likely wont have to compete with tens of other companies offering a position to a more mid or seniorlevel developer.And if all else fails build something nontrivial over the summer.  Developing an Android App is  free up until publishing.  Developing a Windows Phone App is also  free albeit with nonenterprise version of their tools  not that youd need any of that though.  Developing for the web is  free until you decide to host somewhere.  If you put  hours into it each day youll be shocked at how much you can get done.P.S. Kudos for the double major in History.

Study Computer Science unless you cant hack it. Why? It is better compensation and gives you more flexibility. Dont cop out.

Like you I have a documented learning disability. I got my degree and graduated with a . GPA. To get there I had to take the following math courses algebra linear algebra stats discrete math calc I calc II calc III trigonometry and geometrynot in that order. If someone entering college with an eighth graders understanding of math can do this you probably can too.Its important that you honestly evaluate where you are right now mathematically. If your school has placement tests to help you discover where you are take those tests. You may find that you need to backtrack to freshmanlevel highschool math and thats okay. It just means you need to bust ass. Study every day. Use tutors.Take notes in class and then ASAP summarize what youve learned and fill in any gaps. Clarify misunderstandings immediately. You cannot let yourself fall behind at any time. Leverage your tools but dont use them as a crutch. Early on I tried to use Scientific Notebook with only a weak understanding of algebraic concepts and by the time I hit trig I was floundering. Your tools can only fill in so many gaps for you.Chances are it will be hell. Youll have a lot of doubts. Thats normal. A couple times I was reduced to a screaming ball of hatred at my desk. Fuck you triple integrals! Die!All that said web development tends to have less mathematics. You should still at least leave college with an understanding of algebra discrete math and maybe a little calculus. Id be lying if I said I use a lot of calculus but theres something about it along with discrete math that just changes the way you think. Definitely worth the effort. Youll use algebra pretty much wherever you go.If you want to avoid math as much as possible stay away from game and probably scientific programming.Good luck kicking some numerical ass!Back to lurkerdom for me . . . .,cscareerquestions,cgwsd2g,7,t5_2sdpm

If hes hesitant a metricsbased approach doesnt inspire much fervor and probably wont do much to convince him. How closely do you work with others? If youre  more productive but you not being at the office causes for example  other developers to be  less productive each youre not being any more productive and could easily lose productivity if youre an asset to the team.Given what you know about the CEO Id say you run a high risk of attracting some unwanted attention by spending time trying to convince him that you dont have to be at the office as much.  Its not so much the not being at the office its that a metricsbased approach isnt convincing at all easy counterpoints and then you have to start arguing or look like you didnt think it all the way through.Maybe a better tactic would be to suggest one day a week for whatever reason make something up even or since its a review try to negotiate it into whatever raise youre looking at.  Using metrics almost says Im entitled to this benefit even though I know thats not what youre saying.  Hell feel like youre putting him under the gun a little as opposed to seeing any merit in your argument and hell want you to know whos boss.Sometimes you have to be a little Machiavellian.

945070,0,t3_24t858,I dropped out although it was more of flunked out after about . years of university. I spent the next year and a half figuring out what I wanted to do again before getting back into programming on my own time. I got into web development and spent eight months of very heavily devoting my own time to improving as much as possible and freelancing on occasion. Then I got my first web dev job. It sucked the pay was shit the boss was even worse shit and the code base was even worse shit. The work was stressful unfulfilling and I was treated like crap. But while working I made sure that whatever I coded I was learning and improving while doing it. I still devoted a large portion of my personal time to coding and reading and trying to improve skillset. I also networked going to programming meetups in the area to see what opportunities I could find.Seven months after I got that job I decided why not start sending applications out and just testing the water. The first response I got asked me to come in to interview. I naively took the job offer because anything has to be better than where Im currently at. The place also pressured me only giving me two days after the interview to accept or decline their offer. Anyway I went to work at that place for another  months before I realized it was only a small step up from my previous job. Also it gave me a much better perspective on where I was as a developer. Almost none of my coworkers had any ambition or drive to improve their skillset out of the workplace and even in the office the majority of them went about their work with a good enough mentality rather than taking pride in their product or trying to learn new things while they worked. I dont want to be judgemental when I say this I just realized that my mentality wasnt the norm at least from what I had seen so far.Anyway I decided to just shoot a couple applications out and see what came of it again. This time the reception blew me away. Ive already rambled too much. Ill just say that my current job is very good Im making good money and I enjoy what I work on and who I work with.So the whole point I guess Im getting at is sure you can drop out if you want and you can probably get a mediocre developer job if you spend a few months teaching yourself and honing your skills you can land a mediocre web development job no problem. But you need to have or cultivate a drive and passion for programming or else you might find yourself having trouble moving past that first shitty job.Anyway this is all anecdotal so take from it whatever you want. Good luck with whatever you choose to do and make sure that you really heavily weigh your options since this is a really big decision.,cscareerquestions,chbpluj,1,t5_2sdpm
948377,0,t1_chc1m7a,To answer your first few questions  it will DEFINITELY depend on the company and what kind of team you join. For studying purposes I would prioritize learning data structures. This knowledge translates to almost any coding language and I find myself drawing back on what I learned in school in this subject most often. Also consider diving into business analytics topics as you might be working directly with partners on your project. Knowing how to communicate between a developer and a product owner is key. Efficiency in algorithms is important to know about but dont kill yourself over it  thats the developers job. I cant really comment on the role of an SDET. From what it sounds like they play the role of a unit tester. I work primarily with database developers and a .NET web developer and they use UTPL SQL for unit testing their SQL procedures.  I then test the functionality of the procedures within the database and within the UI. Within the past few months Ive begun to use HP quick test pro to start UI automation for my team but Im trying to get us to use selenium. I do have access to the actual code and I definitely try to understand what it is exactly doing in order to simply better myself but I dont do any hands on work with the code until after its pushed to the test environment. ,cscareerquestions,chc36e5,1,t5_2sdpm

At mature engineeringoriented companies a sizeable chunk of time and energy is spent on making sure the code is sound. Most companies fall somewhere in the middle. The suits scream for features and the engineers want to clean up the code. I do remember one utterly brilliant thing that Apple did a while back. They went from Leopard to Snow Leopard without adding any significant new features. The entire project was a code cleanup. This is the most beautifully brilliant thing Ive ever seen a software company do. Trusting their users enough to let the engineers set the agenda for an entire release.

1037303,0,t1_chm50ki,The reason that education with a . GPA and your  years of having an internship rank so much more highly than your skills and projects is because they take considerably more effort and skill than learning HTMLCSS you can effectively learn this in a couple of hours etc. Similarly Responsive DesignBootstrap means nothing I read it to mean that you know what responsive design is and that youve used Bootstrap in a website before which also only takes a couple of hours to learn. JavaScriptjQuery is good JSONAJAX is good. But you dont need to list JavaScript twice.I would rename column  to Languages move Django to column  because its a web framework but leave Python in column  remove JavaScript from column  move OO to column  instead of RDBMS putting MySQL already implied RDBMS put the connector you use next to MySQL put SQL in languages because its a language put the specific unit testing framework instead of Unit Testing did you use JUnit Selenium etc. drop Responsive DesignBootstrap but you can keep HTMLCSS just because filters be looking for that one.For your projects after every project list the technologies that you used in that project like in this CareerCup example  . Dont use transition phrases like work involved or included just end the description of your project and go straight into a list of technologies like in that example. No periods at the end of bullet points.Make sure you capitalize the S in JavaScript Basically when Im reading your resume I want to see what technologies youve learned or mastered or gained expertise in that involve a lot of work and that tends to mean on new grad resumes that education should be at the top and internship experience second because they represent the greatest amount of impressive work.,cscareerquestions,chm72ww,2,t5_2sdpm

Most people probably could learn some programming but also might not ever get to the point where the would be employable. There are many people that say that web programming is the easiest and that you dont even need a degree for it but any avenue you pursue will involve work. Ive only been working part time for a month now but my experience with a java enterprise application is that there are a lot more parts than what you work with on a personal project there are configuration and build tools that I dont really understand the workings of and there are frameworks such as spring and hibernate that I dont even understand the purpose of.

Feel free to only skim the topics you think youre comfortable with  maybe take the quizzes before you pass over a chapter completely and definitely take the time at the end of each sectionchapter to code up examples without looking at the book.Regarding data structures and algorithms  this book has been recommended on rlearnprogramming before and it has a comprehensive companion website if you dont want to shell out the money right away. It includes implementations in Java so that should be helpful to you.Once youre comfortable with programming data structures and algorithms you should definitely learn more Theory  discrete math and automata theory are cool and good places to start. Implementation  operating systems networks and compilers are all cool.

This is because frankly most times the customizations to Wordpress Themes that clients will ask for are really just at the CSS level with minor tweaks within the themes optionsproperties themselves. Once you get used to the PHP syntax youll start being able to tweak and experiment to get a better grasp. Ideally youd master PHP but Im also concerned about making sure you futureproof your skills for your postschoolfulltime goals. PHP is super important on the backend portion but I defer to more experienced Redditors about the state of PHP in the tech community.If you dont already get your own domainhosting. This makes it easier to play aroundexperimenttest with the different things youre learning without worrying about breaking a clients site. Wordpress play around by installing   Wordpress  and mess around with some different themes thats how I learned to mess around with PHP.

1243682,0,t3_285510,Hi I teach at Dev Bootcamp. Good luck with your next move whatever it is.   One were generally thought of as a Ruby on Rails and JS shop but in the last year JS has come into its own as a first class concern. Our final projects are shaped by student interest and theyre frequently deep dives into JS apps using Angular Backbone D and ExpressNode.js etc. So talk to people at the school and look at the projects theyre building. Good schools teach software engineering which is transferable to new languages. At the moment everyone is crazy over Swift which we didnt teach them. Second I think you should talk to graduates from the programs youre looking at. LinkedIn search is an easy way to find people who have been through the program assuming its been around long enough to have alumni. Tell them where you are and what youre looking to achieve. I suspect theyll have well informed insights and no reason to sell you anything. ,cscareerquestions,ci9j39o,3,t5_2sdpm

Dont apply for just one specific role of a software developer apply for support roles and consultant roles.

1409008,0,t1_cisvyhz,I got my current internship after completing my sophomore year of college. I went in expecting not to know how to do anything and the stuff they had me do was pretty basic web app development some basic java here and there. On top of that they expected me to take weeks to learn. So my expectations of the job were really high while their expectations of me were pretty low. That being said the most important part of an internship is your willingness to learn. I started knowing only java and object oriented programming and learned things like HTML html JavaScript how to write code for a LDAP server and many other things along the way. The people at the place are more than happy to help me learn and point me in the right direction as well as give me resources such as books to learn on my own. So having a basic knowledge for an internship isnt bad as long as you have the ability to quickly and efficiently teach yourself. I found my internship through family but the posting was right on their website.

1530000,0,t3_2bqtq7,I recently came from the same situation.  The problem for me was that I worked in an I.T. department in a regular company and in the regular business world  hours is considered a minimum but to my mind  hours of programming is not equivalent to  hours of work in a lot of other fields.  Its just a lot of time to spend in the same place locked in mental mortal combat with yourself.  Now Ill tell you somethings that helped me but honestly I ended up leaving the industry a few months ago and am just now coming back to it due to just complete and epic burnout.  That said.  Things that helped me were .  Exercising daily.  Just get the old ticker pumping and sweat a bit.  Its truly amazing what it does for your body and mind..  Cut out regular caffeine.  If you require a pot of coffee daily to have any modicum of productivity like I did there is an issue there.  Caffeine should be like your afterburner not your primary propulsion..  Get a solid  hours of sleep a night and limit the alcohol if you drink at all.  Alcohol screws with your rem cycle and trying to program while sleep deprived andor hungover is like trying to sew while blindfolded.  .  Get some help if you need it.  Whether that be making some friends to vent or just go bullshit and blow off some steam with at work or talking to your boss about how you feel up to seeing your doc if you really feel you have some focus and attention needs that need some help and theres no shame in that one.But Dad always said find something you love doing and youll never work a day in your life.  Thats false theres a reason why its called work and youre paid to do it but if you find something that gets you fired up and gets you excited to do it?

1530718,0,t3_2bpg1z,Worked from home fulltime for over a year for a company not myself. Let me say its amazing. The best thing in the world. All it takes is a daily routine that includes hygiene eating correctly working out and sleeping. It sounds silly but its really easy to mess that up if you arent disciplined but having each of those sectors locked down makes life feel much better whether you are working at home or in an office.Ill just say it again though working from home fulltime is amazing. Ive never felt more productive and happier on a day to day basis. For me if I wanted to go running on my lunch break then I would go running get home throw leftovers in the microwave hop in for a quick rinseoff grap lunch and eat while I read or continue working all in the timeframe of a usual one hour lunch break. I would also use lulls in my mental process to stop go and do food prep for dinner and then come back to work. That sounds bad until you realize its no different then all the time you waste at work when your concentration breaks its just that youve added something semiproductive in to fill that time. Id be able to eat dinner later that night save leftovers and eat those for lunch the next day. Unless I felt like actually cooking lunch then I could do that in my own kitchen and often did. I ended up at the point of never eating out unless it was for a social occasion good bye fast food runs. I also could sleep in slightly longer because I didnt have a commute and similarly working in PJs is SO comfortable.The downside and its a huge downside is that its basically turned me off of working in an office for the rest of my life. My current job aka the development manager is a be at your desk at  do not leave until  type of place. I dont imagine I will be working there much longer because hes also a micromanager but Im just waiting to find a hopefully great remote opportunity again. When it comes down to it I was simply so much more productive working at home because quality of life was simply so much better.Oh and playing music nice and loud on highquality speakers instead of shit headphones is also tearproducing beautiful!,cscareerquestions,cj85hv6,2,t5_2sdpm

Something like an InterlockedExchange for files. For example you have a systemcritical configuration file and you need to replace it by a new configuration because the user made adjustments. But what happens is that the system could crash during this operation and it is not allowed to have NO configuration as the system will be broken then and cannot start.So what you need to do is to create a new configuration file and put it in the place of the previously existing configuration file. And you need to do this IN A SINGLE STEP regardless if what happens elsewhere. In Linux this is very easy. A shell script could simply do an   mv new oldThe corresponding syscall is rename which is also available in Perl and Python. rename is atomic if it succeeds there is no time in between where neither the old file nor the new file is there.Question How is this done in Windows ?,cscareerquestions,cjae0gf,0,t5_2sdpm

1603721,0,t3_2cndlz,security is probably the hardest field in the spectrum to succeed at.  people often talk about how much time developers or it people spend keeping up with current technology well that pales in comparison to security.  security really requires    hours a day just to stay current if you want to succeed.  it also requires a real interest in technology as youll have to spend what many would think of as mind numbing work to solve problems.  the worst part of the industry is the people.  the people in the industry are the most arrogent elitist immature people that work in technology.so I say all that because ive been around that industry for close to  decades now and actually decided to work at a security company for a few years.  I did well there but just couldnt stand the people.  so rAskNetsec would be a good place to ask more specific questions but ill throw in my two cents.  many security people come from a more sysadmin type background which requires some programming knowledge but not the algorithm type knowledge that a developer requires.  your skillset comes from being familiar with other software knowing the ins and outs of it and being able to modify it in ways that may be unintended.  compilers which are used to compile code written by developers is just another piece of software.  understanding how that compiler will compile the code and understanding how that compiled code will interact with the hardware is the basis of security.so thats the traditional role of security.  on top of that other security roles such as an analyst have been made.  an analyst will asses software or a network create a threat model for it and then come up with solutions to prevent mitigate or accept those risks.  this role is kind of walks the line with technology and business.  they must understand the technological risks and details but must also understand how it relates to the business and be able to communicate that to the higher ups who may only understand the business side of things.anyways I guess that was probably more than two cents worth but hopefully it gives you something to go on.,cscareerquestions,cjhbg28,2,t5_2sdpm

If you find something better and you are certain about it then let your old employer know that you may have no other choice than to accept the opportunity on greener pastures.If they really do care about you more than just another worker they will understand.

However this depends greatly on company culture and the amount of turnover in the company. As for your decision I think unless there is bad blood I would err slightly on the side of staying at least to see if everything you have asked for comes to fruition.  I was in a very similar situation to you and I honestly regret leaving even knowing that the company had a massive lay off about  years after I left mainly because I was so well respected and was on a fast track  things you really shouldnt discount.  I would also evaluate the amount of good and bad will you have in the company to help determine if you should stay. Starting a new job can also be stressful and there is a lot of risk and learning curve involved.  If you have good will and respect at your current job it would be a shame to throw it away.

Theres a few different ways employers can handle bonuses that will affect how much is taken out.From a general sense if you feel you are worth the extra kyr and k one time relocation fee then you shouldnt settle. You could maybe argue the extra kyear up front and then ask for a EOY bonus that repays your relocation fees. Id still be wary though since they could already plan to give you a bonus and just count the k as that bonus.Do you need the relocation? Maybe argue for just the salary bump and sort the cost of moving out yourself.,cscareerquestions,ckj7zzg,1,t5_2sdpm

1939052,0,t3_2guuuk,Hi I have a bit of an odd question that doesnt really apply to computer science but more of information security side but I am guessing the recruiting aspect of the job search is the same correct? Anyways my question is what would I do as someone who works in a completely different field County Gov.Transportation Division but wants to move their career in another direction towards IT and the likes do to get noticed by a recruiter like yourself? My story is this I was a psych major in college big mistakewaste of time etc. My dad hooked me up with an internship with my local county gov which I solely took to make money on the side. Once I graduated and received my degree instead of wasting away on my parents couch I was offered a fulltime job at the dept. and I took it so I wasnt jobless straight out of school. Now since I do not have any formal education in IT or CS or anything computers I have been doing the best I can to play catch up and get a bunch certifications basic and specific A Net Sec CEH Linux ultimately a CISSP and possibly a job on the side to gain some experience which I would assume is an applicants biggest selling point. So after all of that jargon what should someone in my position do in order to be recruited by actual recruiters who are looking to fill a spot? I know I wont be filling an advanced position or anything but possibly a position at a helpdesk or something similar in level. I figured its probably not the best idea to quit my job which pays salary and provides benefits just so I can get a lot of internships in the field. Sorry I know this is more aimed at CS employees but I figured you might know how recruiting goes in these areas of the field. You say LinkedIn is one of the best ways to get noticed by a recruiter but my resume has nothing to stick out in terms of computers and such yet. It will do once I have a few certifications but at the moment I do not have any. Anyways sorry for the novel and I would appreciate some feedback if you have the time.

It doesnt compare because managers cant do whatever they want  they cant give someone a  raise just because though they can certainly pitch it as an idea tie it to performance reviews etc. Managers need to be loyal to their employees and hopefully get that loyalty back.What Ive discovered is weird though. This creates an environment where employees become loyal to people they like regardless of what company they work at. What I mean is if their manager leaves  is fired  whatever and goes somewhere else that loyalty follows. And then you get employee poaching. Companies themselves right now seem like theyre in a weird place. They want loyal employees who are also cheap. Getting rid of longterm employees or letting them leave on their own is good for a company because salaries can get bloated productivity goes down etc. The company itself forgets what loyalty is about. ,cscareerquestions,cl8eypp,2,t5_2sdpm

Whenever I have been on a strong team I worked well and we learnt from each other with relatively low stress.  On the other hand if you were to be placed alone somewhere with a weakno manager things can get pretty bad quickly.  I worked third level support for a huge financial company and being on my own with production issues for months on end it got to me badly.  At this stage in my career I have been in so many bad situations that I am a bit numbed by it.

There is a lot of statistics and the advanced stuff uses calculus as well. Unfortunately Im in the process of taking the upper division stats sequence in the math department so I cant tell you exactly what beyond the fact that my Stochastic Processes I course has a prereq of differential equations .Basically discrete math is not enough for this sort of stuff.gt I would like to know how difficult it is to get a career in AI compared to other computer science jobsSo this is again stuff I learned from this sub other reddit CS subs asking my research advisor and talking to a friend at Googlex. Basically if youre OK doing implementation stuff you can get off with just a B.S. with experience or M.S. To quote my friend who works on ML at Google theres a lot of prediction pipeline stuff done. So he combines data does analysis to ensure the data is usable and stuff along that line he also does what I consider more interesting work like feature engineering look it up but as he told me thats only one part. Actually setting up the data is a big part of it too not just the theory techniques.He didnt go over exactly what the PhD people work on though he did say that the people working on the core algorithms do a lot more math he as the person working on applications doesnt do too much math.So generally the rule of thumb is if you want to be doing implementation stuff just open up Google and start using the Python packages as someone else said.

Relax!  Go into these interviews unafraid of rejection.  Part of the interview is you are evaluating and scrutinizing them.  For example I have no qualms about telling companies I have a work smart not hard philosophy and several companies have likely rejected me because of this saving me the effort of rejecting them.. Try to focus less on startups and more on the reasons why youre seeking a change.  Do you want more independence project diversity smaller team more flexibility more influence more exiting projects less bureaucracy relaxed environment?  Most startups will pretend to offer these things but not all of them actually do.  You may even find what youre seeking at specific teams within larger companies..  Keep interviewing!

2271579,0,t1_cls928h,Im going to piggy back off this advice because its solid.If youre used to using Python you shouldnt have too big of an issue jumping into Java because it is also an Object Oriented Programming language. I imagine a lot of the hurdles youre encountering are syntactical in nature. You simply learn them by doing the programming. You mentioned you underestimated the amount of time necessary to do the assignments. Remember these classes should be designed for beginners. Typically as the semester progresses they get more difficult and they build upon a foundation that youre hammering these basic fundamentals into your brain.While we wont answer your homework questions for you if you get stuck please visit rlearnprogramming and use a Java or Help tag.As far as study habits are concerned  hours a day does seem to be a lot. However immersion is the best method of learning anything. Eat sleep and breathe it. Now if were being realistic if you make DAMN sure you get  or  QUALITY hours in every day I guarantee you will not only pass this class you will probably receive exemplary marks. Remember read the material before you go to the lecture and do your best to try and do it the night before or a day or two so that you can mentally chew it for a while sleep and properly cement that goodness into your noodle. That way when you get to the lecture youre connecting these other dots together that you couldnt do on your own. Youre mentally sharp and able to ask questions about the shit that matters  the shit that DIDNT make sense when you studied it on your own time. I saved this part for last Remember if the curriculum is shit you can go to another professor. This recommendation was made last because all of the above should be attempted first.

2494125,0,t1_cmk3igy,What I meant by the grand scheme of things was that it may not be actual software development.  Yes sometimes automation could be via pure code but sometimes it could be using GUI based tools and have little true code.  And even if you get lucky in getting pure code based testing it is extreme easy to get stuck in a rut by simply replicating the same stuff over and over again since OP is likely to start working in an already existing automation codebase. I probably have a heavy bias on what I think proper development is but to explain I think it means you think about running times space efficiencies architectures algorithms etc.  I personally find testing does not touch these concepts very well if at all.  This is the type of stuff that OP will have to self teach while they get the practical code experience through automation. ,cscareerquestions,cmk4c5b,1,t5_2sdpm

That being said I had no problem getting fulltime interviews from the Big  and then some.While a recognizable name can be important its really something you have to consider in the grand scheme of things. I didnt need a big name internship to carry my resume because I had a strong GPA interesting personal projects and I also go to a target CS school. Therefore the experience of the internship alone was enough.If I were in your shoes I would take into consideration the other factors of an application and try to decide if you really need that big name. While youre right in that big names can open doors Im not sure how respected Goldman Sachs is in the tech world and it might not actually matter as much as you think. Your other post said that you already have  other internships which is pretty exceptional and would personally cause me to lean towards the option that results in higher personal growth.Thats my perspective anyway. I faced the exact same dilemma when I got caught between  fulltime offers.

2675221,0,t3_2qnfjb,I was recently promoted to management after being a software engineer. Its a very difficult transition especially if you are a very technical person and derive a lot of your self worth from your ability to solve technical problems.Moving into management isnt just a promotion  its a career change. The technical skills you acquired as an individual contributor will help you be a better technical manager. However on the flip side the skills that made you a successful developer will not help you be a successful manager. The best developer on the team more often than not does not make the best manager. The two jobs require very different skill sets.Keep in mind that management roles differ by organization but here are some things you should ask yourself Are you comfortable with coding significantly less or not at all? As a manager you are interruptible which means you will likely not be actively participating in project work. Your engineers will be doing that. Your new job among other things will involve keeping your team focused. You will also have to go to a lot of new meetings which leads into the next question. Do you mind lots of meetings? Your new role will likely come with a slew of new meetings to put on your calendar. Do you care about business problems? When I was an engineer I didnt have to care about why the projects we worked on were important. The technical problems were what was interesting to me. As a manager you have to care about the business side. Plus you have to balance the needs of the business with the time of your team. Sometimes the business wants something that might be nice but would take significant effort to implement and would not produce much value. Alternatively you may have to justify why your team needs to work on a purely technical project to the business. Are you a people person? As a manager you not only have to interact more with people from different parts of the business but you also have to manage to the people you are supervising. This includes mentoring your team doing performance reviews conflict management etc.A few pros The money is generally a lot better.   Your actions have a larger impact than they would as an individual contributor.  When your team succeeds you look really good. You have an opportunity to take a big picture approach to the concerns of your team.Some cons You probably wont be doing much coding. Your engineering skills will probably decrease over time if you dont actively keep them sharp. The transition is very difficult. Evaluating the performance of your team is a drag and is really painful if one or more of them is substandard.Moving into management can be a great opportunity but it is not a decision to take lightly. Try talking to people who made the transition. At my current job I know people who love being a manager and some that really hate it. Find people like that and talk to them and ask for advice.I personally do not enjoy being a manager and will probably look for a new job in the next year or so in order to transition back to an individual contributor role. For me I just dont find the problems that managers are supposed to solve all that interesting. More money is nice but its little consolation if you dont enjoy your job.,cscareerquestions,cn7ruhv,5,t5_2sdpm

2694002,0,t1_cna7gv0,Well...The experience of having to whiteboard an idea in front of a VP to explain why your idea is right your coworker is wrong and you arent just an idiot is also stressful and Ive been there too on my job.  Theres also the less stressful here let me explain the networking stack which goes on the whiteboard too.Actually we use the whiteboard at my job a lot so being able to clearly communicate ideas in that method is a very good skill to test.  At the higher levels it might be more valuable than writing code.The part that isnt realistic is the fact that during the interview you are stressed as hell knowing that you have a very short amount of time to impress this guy or girl and then youre done.But really every job interview is like that.  Even an interview with an easygoing conversation and no quiz questions will involves a degree of stress.  The experience is doubly stressful if youre doing something you dont often do which is try to explain your thought process out loud to someone else.So for any interview Id say the important part is to practice exposure to all those stressors.  Do something as similar to the interview as possible.

Feels like theyre trying to sell us.Then we find out theyre splitting the business into two businesses. This is making me much more personally identifiable but I dont care. They wont come out and say it directly but theyre preparing to sell off all the struggling bits of the unwieldy unconnected product lines and let the successful half reinvest in itself for more explosive growth. So theres an explanation however shitty and I dont feel that my particular system or job area is under undue scrutiny. Honestly the changes that are being made all point toward a streamlined centralized configuration such that any manufacturing facility will be capable of manufacturing a given unit such that we can maximize profits and minimize the time between order and delivery. I feel very secure about the software products future. Its just horribly mismanaged.I think my boss would pay as much as he was allowed but HR really holds the purse.

Right now the programming field is a bit flexible but you dont know if itll always be like that. You wont know if you need to go get a masters later. So just get the degree. Also college is about more than just getting prepared for a job. You grow a lot at college if you go out of high school. I know a lot of people say you should wait till you know what you do but college is where I figured out what I wanted to do. Until you take the classes its hard to know what you want to do. Plus its not the same experience if you go when youre significantly older than the rest of the population. You mature a lot emotionally at college. You can try things that youd never get the chance to try otherwise. I joined a competitive public speaking team on a whim. What I learned there has helped me in every aspect of my life.

Before even getting an offer or counteroffer youve decided that youd rather stay with your current employer or use this new offer as a bargaining chip to get more out of them with no intention of taking the new job.

2892207,0,t3_2t7xjh,While there are coding standards at companies bad design is the main culprit of bad code.  I work at a  person company and on the project Im on there are  software engineers for a verity of subsystems.   The subsystem I am in charge of had gone through  other developers before I it came to me.  I work with  other people since its a fairly large subsystem.  When you look at the code it was pretty crappy and you could tell  different people with  different design plans were in there.  Class that were  lines were common.  No division of responsibility or anything.I made sure every time I fixed an anomaly I fixed that code too. It could be something as making a new class fixing variable naming or just cleaning up methods.  Then issues came up where the current design just didnt work and me and the people I worked with just redesigned the whole thing using inheritance and all.  So over time the code will look great I hope.On the flip side when its time to cut a release Im always cutting it close since to fix anomalies I redesigned code to make sense and not patchedband aid the fix it like other people.  Other subsystem leads ether dont want to do redesign for being scared of breaking it or just dont give a shit.  I know every time I mention something about redesign or new module at status meetings this one engineer always likes to joke about how I have to be done sooner or later.I guess the point is there are software engineers who like the design aspect and some who are indifferent and look for easy solutions and not necessary that elegant one. Taking a feature and figuring out how the classes will be laid out and who will be responsible for what is interesting and enjoyable for me  The coding is fun too but once you have your design everything is just following that design for the most part.

To further answer the question that would be a D array matrix of integers say collection B. The original picture is collection A. Each ij integer in collection B represents the RGB in collection A at ij respectively.The RGB value from ij in collection A is stored amp masked to the int value in collection B at ij.If you want to impress them further you make collection B a D array as that increases the efficiency should you ever traverse collection B linearly.

A lot of the AngelList startups use Ruby or Python as their main language and I really dont have any big projects in either. Last startup I interviewed for was in NY and their stack included Ruby and Cassandra I have no real experience in either but I understand how they work. I made it to the final interview stage got flown out and everything but ultimately got rejected because their requirements changed during the process and theyre now looking for Dev Ops instead of Software Engineer. I was told they liked me though and thought I would be a good fit so they might try to reconnect in about  months. So keep in mind the risks you take when going the startup route. Age cutoff? Its illegal in most all? states to discriminate based on age. Granted startups do so anyways in some small way but theyll never actually admit it.

Ive been asked those same two questions about a dozen times.Thats kind of the point. The interviewers goal for new grads is usually to measure their potential and not their experience. Complex designarchitecture questions are inferior to algorithm questions when it comes to measuring problem solving skills  a difficult area to train and hence why its typically considered synonymous with potential.It doesnt really matter how you ace the interviews. Something I realized while I was doing programming contests was that theres a strong correlation between how good you are and how many problems youve solved. It doesnt mean that someone who has solved  problems is always x as good as someone who only has solved  this is where training efficiency comes in. But its unheard of for someone who hasnt practiced at all to be good they are probably lying about how much theyve practiced to make themselves look better.As a wise man once said genius is  talent and  hard work. Memorizing isnt unfair. Everyone can and should do it. You know theyll ask those questions during interviews. Choosing not to practice means that you are either really lazy or really dumb neither being very strong selling points!gt However one doesnt really understand the importance of cachefriendly code or hashtable load factors until they experience it first hand for example.Problem is that I cant prepare a meaningful  minute interview session on those topics. New graduates are not knowledgeable enough for me to keep the conversation flowing. There are a lot of intricacies around caches but new graduates only know the standard textbook answer. You cant really hold it against them either since nothing on their resume suggests that they should know better. This is unlike say if you interview an Architect with  years of C compiler experience. Asking domainspecific questions to new graduates tend to degenerate into a quiz.gt For example knowing the distinct differences between C and C should be mandatory should it be related to the position the candidate is being considered for just an example. Knowing what use case between each and where they excell is important.All of them will give you very similar answers depending on which camp they are in. Its either bad performance and GC spikes or JIT is great and GC allows more optimal memory layouts. This makes it very difficult for you as an interviewer to differentiate between the candidates.Ive unfortunately never met a new graduate who can draw from firsthand experience to form their own opinion such as you will anyway have to manually manage resources like memory for performance reasons so you might as well stick with C.gt Maybe Im being purely anecdotal with my experiences and the ones I know of people like me. It sounds like youve definitely been around the block more. However I dont necessarily think that means I have to agree with you and that youre correct.Theres really no right or wrong here! Anything that gets you the candidates you want and rejects those you dont want is a win. Im just trying to give some reasoning on why Big  interviews tend to be skewed in one direction or another depending on how far along you are in your career.

3090477,0,t3_2vjant,I would look into a consultant for now. If you dont already HAVE a development team you cant BUILD a development team. And building a development team is hard and can take years.You wont even be able to interview. Its common knowledge in software that you can only hire of developers you already have. You need great developers to hire other great developers and good developers to hire good ones. And there is a whole set of skills involved in interviewing developers that you just wont have available.With a good consultant they will have already done all of that. You can then have an interview process of several years as one or more consultants work for you. Once a relationship has been established the consulting firm will likely eventually let you take someone on full time who you now know you can trust.Know this though this type of work is EXPENSIVE! Super expensive. Even outside of the big tech hubs the kid of guy you need is going to cost k just in salary. Going through a consultant can easily mean paying k per year double salary plus a cut for the company.There are programmers and then there are engineers and then there are senior engineers.

Usually . In a tech hub? Increase all those numbers by .Oh and you have to change large parts of your company structure to accommodate the fact that SOFTWARE BUSINESS WORKS LIKE NOTHING ELSE IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD! There are all KINDS of business assumptions that just dont WORK with software. And the change has to go all the way up to the top levels of management. The CEO and president need to develop a new way of thinking about planning for it to work. Even simple things like setting a release date estimating how long something will take and managing teams and assigning tasks work DRASTICALLY different when you are working on software. All of that combines to mean its very hard to develop a software team that can really take on new greenfield projects.So consultants can be a great deal. Which is why they will cost xy whatever the salaries are. Double the salary add a cut and thats the cost of a consultant.Thats a hard pill for many companies to swallow. Im just explaining why even they are so expensive consulting firms are still incredibly in demand. Its just...so...friggin...HARD to build a development team without focusing your whole company on it.Of course that is assuming you are wanting to make a real quality complex product. Plenty of companies dont need that. They just need some internal applications that mainly use web pages and arent too complicated. For that you can just take put up a job posting for a developer and pay the k. Hell be slower because you are paying for training and learning and the product probably wont be something you can sell.But if you are wanting to make a worldwide connected robust high quality product? Yeah. Its going to be expensive.Source Currently a Software Architect and Technical Team Lead previously worked at several consulting firms.

3123748,0,t1_colnw24,Dont get me wrong Im not suggesting I could stay at Imperial and top my classes while not doing any work. I dont think a third class degree is particularly impressive Though Im young and naive which is one of the reasons Im here asking questions even at an institute like Imperial. You dont even need to get half of the marks for that.How major are we talking? I imagine I would be essentially unemployed for maybe  years before I got a job and Im ok with that. Maybe  if I can find some small income to give me enough to actually eat. If it were a given that Id need to work on numerous high profile projects for  years or something I think thatd be likely to sway me but Im guessing thats not the case? Something like two years of hustling on low or nonexistant income is something Im totally prepared for now. Both my youth and circumstances allow for it I think.In the event I ended up in a job that turned out to be ridiculously dull and uninspiring to what extent would the experience there soften the blow of not having a degree? Does experience trump a degree to the extent a degree trumps A levels or are they not at all similar?Maybe I should consider startups? I almost dont want to because it feels like Im just putting my head in the clouds and thinking life is all rosy victories. Im sure theres something I can do with IT and language skills.

Most smart people in America now have realized that software development  big bucks. CS degree enrollment is way up and the number of people going the selftaught route is growing rapidly by the month.Zero experience? That makes zero sense. Youll see a lot of ads out there for boot camps which promise to take you from being some guy in your parents basement eating chips to rich software developer in   or  weeks.

Sure you can find one person out of  that managed to pull something like that off but it can be attributed to luck more than anything else. The best way to get a software development job is to try programming out on your own. If you like it go to school and get a bachelors in CS and get internships every summer.

Its much harder to define an explicit mapping than to just check if one works.All the other responses here seem to be wrong to my understanding since the mapping from numbers to letters isnt fixed.

Federal law stipulates several guidelines one of which states that the intern must receive TRAINING for the job field and it MUST NOT benefit the company in any manner. Your link is dead for some reason. Personally Im in the middle of looking for my own replacement. Im inclined not to hire a person who took an unpaid internship especially if I know the states laws regarding it and when I speak to the company she or he interned and got an idea of what it is they did during their internship. If a company is too cheap to pay an intern even  an hour then they do not deserve to hire any interns.

Ive also taught myself C and C but I havent had a job using any of those.PHP is kind of a mixed bag because its low learning curve is a blessing and a curse. Because so many jobs in web want experience in it but also too many jobs doing more basic work where PHP is just a checkbox most companies tick to deliver something to the client than to build something impressive with it.

3341868,0,t3_2yfw7h,Hello madam or sir!I was in the exact same boat as you. Literature undergrad worked in IT for a few years after graduating UC Santa Cruz in  wanted to go back to school for CS.  I started off by calling a few schools all of which said that they werent taking nd baccs and that this was a pretty recent thing budget cuts etc. So I settled on applying for a masters. Called more schools and did more research and found out that I would have to make up a bunch of course work. Basically you have to take all of the core CS courses from intro on up. So  years ago I started taking  city college classes per semester. At community college I took Calc  Calc  Linear Algebra Discrete Math Intro to programming Java Data Structures and Assembly Language. I ended up getting in to Cal Poly and this allowed me to skip a bunch of classes though I still had to make up Computer Architecture OS Systems Programming Algorithms Software Engineering Theory of Computation and Programming Languages. Im in my second year at Cal Poly now and Im pretty much done with all the undergrad makeup classes with a few grad courses and some thesis work out of the way as well. Hoping to finish by Winter of next year.Anyway feel free to let me know if you have more questions.,cscareerquestions,cp974kg,3,t5_2sdpm

My programming was basically nonexistent before I started my masters I only did some programming in middle school and then some tutorials in Python now Im not that great but I think I can do it. The biggest problem is that I dont really know any language at a more than a basic level. I can do a fair share of C and maybe some C and thats it. You should look into an algorithms Thomas Cormen is pretty much a classic Sedgewick if you want something lighter as well as some maths for CS students Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis by Clifford A. Shaffer has an introductory section that covers the basics perhaps theres something better out there. Go through job offers to see which languages are in demand here Java and C are the most popular and learn one of them itll definitely pay off later.

3368902,0,t3_2yqnys,I think Im going to put together a article on corporate culture.

You simply are not supposed to say what you said. You can use the info in your calculations. But to tell some HR type that you know someone elses salary ... bad move. Disturbs the corporate order and HR is all about preserving and enforcing the corporate order.Also dont mention Glass Door. Learn to communicate directly. The question is what do YOU want. So you say I want ... That makes you a person who knows what they want. I saw on Glassdoor ... just tells them you have no idea what you want. Anyway no harm no foul everyones got to learn these things. Corporations are very ritualized and there are a lot of unwritten rules. And HR people are not your friend. ps  I notice that others commented that what you did was legal. Well yes of course its legal for your friend to tell you his salary. It is also dumb to admit as much to HR. Because thats how HR thinks. Now you know. pps  I see that every other commenter said the HR rep was wrong. That is not the point! The point is to get the job.

They might think you got fired and couldnt a job even if you tell them otherwise employers dont trust candidates very much.My suggestion would be to contract during that time and make sure to include which projects youve worked on during that period of time.

3600128,0,t3_31jaxi,As one guy said at present the hiring managers and recruiters may be skimming your resume and arbitrarily tossing it into the discard pile upon perceiving you to be some kind of job hopper.  My advice to you to workaround this hiring bias on your resume list each position as being a contract position even if somenone of them actually were not.  For example use position titles such as Developer Contract or Contract Software Engineer.I havent seen your resume but it might not hurt to put a summary line at the top listing how many actual years of experience you have.  I am a software engineer with X number of years experience in Y technology stack Java .NET Python etc.. There may be another kind of bias where all they see is a string of short term positions so they dont correctly tabulate the actual number of years of experience you have to determine if you meet the minimum cutoff or not.In my experience midlevel software development positions such as Dev QA BA should have little to no problem getting their next job.  In my state there is a huge bias against entrylevel noobs who have no real experience or only have  years of experience as it seems for most jobs the only meaningful criteria is that the candidate have  or  years already under their belt.In my analysis and personal observation and experience a midlevel should be getting spamfucked by LinkedIn recruiters left and right.  A good midlevel should in theory be able to land ANY comparable job in his state within weeks of needing the next job.  Ive seen stuff where they were like You have  years experience? BAM! You hired! They looked at my resume for like  seconds I only performed mediocre on the interview yet it seems they hired me on the sole basis and merit that I just simply had  years experience.Of course my field is QAAutomation so my job prospects situation in my local metro area might be different than yours.

Create a good resume cover letter and websitegithub with code samples nothing big just what you mightve written in class. Also make a LinkedIn and if you like startups and AngelList angel.co profile.Secondly canvas the cities you are interested in for programming companies. Find positions but also just find companies. Were going to be making opportunities along with finding them. I suggest utilizing your schools career services office and maybe also getting in touch with schools in the cities. LinkedIn will also have a large list of openingscompanies to reach out to.Create an application. Tweak your resume and cover letter to highlight experience relevant for that specific company.

In the US in my experience most employers dont give a fuck whether you even have a degree they prefer people who are experienced.You have nothing to worry about.  Find a weeknight weekend or onlinebased social science credits course at a community college and take it to finish your degree.  You might miss out on graduating with your peers but at least youll be able to actually finish the degree in the offchance a future employer actually bothers to verify educational attainment from my experience very few do want to waste the money to obtain transcripts although they certainly could so there is that to consider.I went to school parttime and worked a fulltime job for years balancing everything to put me through the crap known as school.  Many many people work the balancing act by working fulltime jobs crap jobs to put themselves through school or even real software jobs to put themselves through graduate school.Just dont inform your employer that youre taking weeknight weekend or online classes because then they might think that youre distracted and not giving your full time and attention to the employers work and it could affect the perception of your standing among your peers and managers.

If youre a new grad people will want to and expect to mentor you. If youre a bootcamp grad people expect you to prove yourself since so many boot camps out there are crap and theres a general stigma against them. If youre selftaught its a mix of the two but people will be impressed with your drive. Its three totally different paradigms and while school brand power goes miles youre still fucked if you dont know the fundamental material youre working with. I know people with degrees who couldnt find work in the field and I know selftaught people working at Fortune s.This field is constantly evolving and companies want general brains and competency more than they care about a flavor of the month framework. Plenty of people walk into interviews with your exact mindset and then bomb fizzbuzz.Also CS is to physics as programming is to engineering. If you work your ass off you could squeeze out a CS degrees worth of coding knowledge in about a year or year and a half of self teaching and working on small projects.

Write down everything you do.Next to each write how many hours per week youre spending. Dont lie to yourself because you think youll be judged. If a task should take five minutes but it really takes six hours you put down six hours.Everything in this business takes a lot longer than anyone thinks it will even after you try to take this into account. So now you have your list and you add up the hours. If its only  hours then your workload is normal and youre just stressing. If its  well ok hell youre young and its the tech biz.If its  you go to your boss ... schedule a time so that your boss has cleared his calendar and is in a receptive frame of mind. You go in show them the list and you say ... in the calmest most relaxed most matter of fact voice you can muster ... you should practice this at home ...Can you please help me set my priorities? Which  hours worth of tasks are most important?I guarantee you your boss will get it. Here is the deal. Every workplace on Gods green earth consists of far more work than the workers can handle. If you suffer in silence dont speak up get resentful get stressed and quit you learn nothing. If you learn to manage up as I call it you learn to be a professional. Your boss is not a mindreader nor is your boss a mean evil person intent on making you miserable. And hes most definitely not a mindreader.Your boss only knows what you tell him. If you explain in rational businesslike terms what your workload is and you ask for help setting your priorities you solve your problem and you help your boss to know whats going on with you. Now youre a professional. You know how to communicate to your boss manage your own workload handle a situation like a professional.You did not complain you did not say there was a problem you did not get emotional. You simply took a logic problem to your boss. You have more on your plate than you can handle and you need his perspective in order to set your priorities.Thats your opportunity here.

Its not going to be easy nor cheap to apply and get accepted apply to as many top universities with groups working on this subject as you can afford. But if you do get accepted then most likely you will get tuition  an OK stipend to live by. Summer internships as a postgrad can pay extra. PhD programs in the US are  years of hard work that you have to be up for thats why being passionate about the subject is important. Often there is an out at  years to fail with only a masters degree. In any case you get up to  years postgraduation work visa which with a good company sponsoring you can turn into a green card. Also with a US postgrad degree you will be a good candidate for skilled jobs in other developed countries.,cscareerquestions,cr0b9s4,1,t5_2sdpm
3897917,0,t1_cr0jh2l,That correlates strongly with what I found out from Payscale thanks to uBuckminster.  It appears Im rather underpaid at k even where Im at in Texas.  I guess my major concern right now is that all my experience is in MFCCSQLC and even though my new web app I have using AngularJS  C WebAPI I still feel novice compared to the people I will be competing against.My enterprise experience is really good. I took our app from VCMBCS to VSUnicode and incorporated the Ribbon look and increased sales dramatically .  I rewrote our database warehousing product C and shrunk the process from a week long to less than a day with no loss of data. I either rewrote or added six new views to our enterprise application within the last year and a half. We had no real QA department and I was tired of our old process being ineffective so I hired some part time people and I implemented a much stronger dev process that incorporates QA and automated testing. I do product demosconferencessales calls on a semi regular basis. Manage about  devs and  interns on my team. Built a working prototype of our new web application in March using AngularJSC WebAPI .The problem is two fold I would MUCH rather work in new tech like AngularCExpressNodeanything really and I would like get my hands out of updating legacy enterprise software.  As I mentioned earlier my biggest concern is that I dont know if can realistically compete with all these guys out there.Ive even laid down the framework for a portfolioresume style website that uses the newer tech so I can try and market myself to a larger audience and improve my position.  I just dont know if that will actually do anything to help hence my post here.  ,cscareerquestions,cr0lhd7,1,t5_2sdpm

4010214,0,t1_crcmtj1,I put in a full days work today but at the end of the day I talked to the boss about this.I was professional about it and raised my concerns too him. As far as the web dev side of things he said that hes be happy to shift me onto another project where Id be happier and learning the kind of stuff that I want to learn.But after today and this reddit post I was a lot more concerned about it being unpaid especially as over the course of this summer I will be doing some heavy lifting on the projects Im assigned to. This was more clear to me today more than previously. I am also working alongside another paid dev.I dont think my skills are anywhere near good enough to create whatever I am supposed to efficiently. Right now I work at a snails pace imo but still I would be producing work that is being used for profit.It is a very small company about  people total including me. I do think my experience there would be valuable and it being a small company also holds certain benefits.The boss said he understands but its never been an issue in the past with other interns some of whom are employed devs now. Hes obviously disappointed because he wanted to invest time into me before employing me but by the time I get offered employment Ill probably be moving out of state anyway and would not be able to accept. He said no hard feelings if I choose to leave.The internship offers a stipend but from what Ive read online that is not a substitute for wages.The boss and everyone else there is very nice I dont think they have any bad intentions or are playing any manipulative games but I would very clearly be doing serious work as much as I can get done in hrswk for very cheap.I didnt make a decision for sure to quit or not yet.

4045637,0,t1_crheceh,Going to quote myself again from a previous post. SFA was the University I was attending.gt Another good thing about SFA is that there is something called the Honors College. This program is something that I personally went through and found to be extremely helpful in my acquirement of not only my current job but also internships as well. Unlike bigger Departments the CS Dept has to do Honor Contracts where you end up typically either doing research for a presentation or better imo a extra semester long project. If you go in with the idea that when you hit your xx and xx courses you will vary your project touching many different technologies and different languages you will find yourself with a large coding portfolio. Not to mention being able to pitch yourself to recruiters say something like I had to negotiate with my professors the requirements and acceptance criteria for a major course project EVER semester I was in school Recruiters ate that up!.These  where my main meat and potatoes from school for interviewing network API for battleship for the rest of the class to use for a project building a binary calculator bit in C key thing was this was my first time using C too. Nothing like a trial by fire to help learn. Deriving a new confidence interval for Students T distribution for the estimation of the mean and then making auto generated distributions in R REALLY COOL LANGUAGE! and outputting those results to a spreadsheet and graphs D Soft Operating system in C where I emulated CPU cycles multiple users and other things. A simple Parallal programming problem in ADA a language highly used by the US military and very intuitive for parallel problems.From work my favorite project to talk about was when I worked at Garmin Internation as a SE interngt I ended up being pulled in on a statistical project in which I had to advise whether or not a new mathematical formula would help increase the accuracy of the GPS units onboard the airplane guidance systems garmin makes would add enough value to justify  Software Engineers working on it for a few months. So there are many different formulas to estimate the distance and route to take between two latlong points on the earth. The big difference between the formulas are the assumptions they make about the earths shape. If you are not already aware the earth is not a perfect sphereovalnicegeometricshape. It is a very bumpy rock. Sadly to have a formula that takes every bump and blimp and the earths surface has not yet been fully developed. And even if it was it would be so costineffective to use on the small ARM chip processors that run in GPS units that by the time you got a result you would be kilometers past your destination. I spent a week or so generating data piping it through R and generating confidence intervals on  unique areas around the globe and cross areas withing those  So you might travel from ireland to US would be moving from location X to location U and I would keep track of that. Magic waving hands of statistical powers. I was able to confidently say  confidence with a minor chance of deflation in that statistical confidence that the new formula would only increase the accuracy by  and that is mainly only short trips something like the Cessna TTx could make. So technically lets say point A was at  lat and  long and you were flying to  lat  long if you only used the GPS once and then turned off its recieving capabilities then your first and only flight directive would make you end up at something like . lat and . long. Hopefully that made sense.From work as well but a nontech experiencegt I worked at a small stained glass shop that services a lot of Catholic churches all up and down East Texas. This allowed me to learn a bit of design and interfacing with customers. I learned a great deal of soft skills that typically are not taught in a Programming environment. This has helped me in the oddest of ways along with being a great couple stories to tell at interviews about nontechnical things I have done.I have many other stories and things but I really should be working now P Standup in in a handful of minutes and I have to remember what I did yesterday.

Im not a huge fan but again we dont really go overboard with it. We dont have outside customers so work is decided between Tech and Product. Product being the major driver but there is always time for Tech projects.Recently our data set grew so big that it started crashing the SQL Server so we started investigating and porting some stuff to the Hadoop ecosystem.

4098294,0,t1_crnb4uq,Ya programmers dont really need to know calculus at all unless youre doing physics or scientific modeling kinda stuff Ive found. But data structures Lists Queues Stacks Heaps Trees Graphs and efficiently doing things certainly requires some ability to perform logic and even reasoning.  Every algorithm that people use have a proof behind it proving that it works makes progress and accomplishes the goal.  Id say the three biggest forms of math that are used in computer science algorithms are statistics and probability trigvectormatrix math discrete mathematics in no specific order.Statistics and probability start to come into play with more advanced algorithms.  You usually wont start to see these until start of rd year  year Uni..  Fairly fun problems here its my favorite of the three types of math.  Usually start seeing that as soon as you start taking graphics classes sometimes earlier.TrigVectorMatrix math is used for image processing massively parallel operations animations GPU shaders and basically anything related to graphics or movement in d space. Discrete mathematics for learning things like Runtime complexity boolean logic and conditionals finite state machines etc.  This is usually end of year  and everyone kind of hates it so dont be put off by it if you do.  They introduce some probability and statistics here also.  Also conditionals amp truefalse Im sure youve seen in your lessons thats this being applied.Calculus Ive never actually had to ever use in any programming Ive done so dont worry if you suck at that.

Now if you are actually writing unit tests or something which at least requires some coding then thats better although still not ideal. Its wrong but people reading resumes make snap decisions and calling yourself a Testing Engineer while applying for development jobs will be an uphill battle to overcome even if your job was actually writing code.Reading the rest of your comments in this thread I also suspect that the manager really wants more testers and is hoping to leverage your inexperience in the job market into jumping at that job.

4116993,0,t1_cro3e14,Hey I really liked your resume but I thought I could give you some pointers.The first things that strikes me is the fact that you have a  page long resume. I think it is a bit much considering you have not even finished your masters yet. Ideally you should keep it to a page and make it very easy to read so even the busiest of HR people could glance at it and understand your experience and background. Second why say Academic in experience? Was it through a class? Did you get payed? I think it isnt very clear what do you mean by ExperienceAcademic. You might want to consider removing it.Third you should consider removing this skills section altogether. You have a pretty good list of projects you have been involved in dont they already show the skills you have used and know?Lastly It is very wordy. You have several acronyms and the language you used is not very clear.  Someone else in this thread posted this resume See how he used action verbs to create value? He breaks things into bullet points and uses language like Used Developed...it is clear and shows confidence!Hope this helps you,cscareerquestions,crpkaao,1,t5_2sdpm

There were teams that were super passive aggressive and would leave  comments on a  line code change PR just to assert that they knew more than me. There were teams that just totally and completely ignored that I was there to the point that I had to beg my manger for projects otherwise I was just sitting there twiddling my thumbs.I think the best advice I can offer is to not let your team mates get to you. They are ignorant and fools for ignoring your wealth of information and perspective. Find that one person who likes to work with you and just run with it. There are definitely jobs and teams out there that will respect you for who you are.My favorite coping mechanism for people who assume Im stupid is to respond to all their assertions with well... why do you think that? and make them explain why they think what I know is right is wrong. most of the time they find their own error but when they dont it open a window for me to them teach them.Id be happy to chat more about it offline.,cscareerquestions,crriskx,113,t5_2sdpm

The trap that most of us fall into is thinking that the choice is only A or B but most times there is a third option C if you are willing to be creative and brainstorm. It sounds like you crave human company at work and that need will be met at the startup along with working on a cool product which could up your energy level.Right now you have fallen into a rut at work and therefore have lost the energy and enthusiasm you had for it when you started. The only thing that keeps you going is the paycheck. If the startup can achieve the same for you and give you more human company why not go for it?

Automation of processes builds and testing  any repetitive thing you do see if there is a way to automate it and save yourself time.. Small assistant tools. Where I work we deal with encrypted binary files. But since the customers will send us those files when they have a problem I made a tool to decrypt and anazyle the data so it easier to look at the important data vs loading our app and clicking through the various forms..

4452025,0,t3_3c33o0,I believe personal projects help alot. I got asked about mine alot when I was looking for a job. I would recommend making some. You might even be forced to make some creative projects later on if you have to take classes like senior project. For me personally I just liked doing stuff to make my life simpler. I went to a big school and there were hundreds of courses each semester with different professors. So I made a schedule optimizer to pick my classes with parameters such as classes no early than X classes no later than Y etc. It started out rough and just generated every permutation. It was fun then refining it to pull data from ratemyprofessor rating to weight which schedule was better. Or trying to minimize the gap between classes. Basically I made something that was useful for me and something I wanted. Projects take work but I can attest they help you get a job. Its easier if you find something you like and something youd want. If you have absolutely no passion or ideas just copy and remake something that already exists. Think of it as an investment for your future. A project that takes you  hours may open the door to interviews for jobs that pay k more. Unless your project is breathtakingly revolutionary they will almost never get you a job but theyll make getting callbacks and interviews easier. Edit In direct response to your questions gt So what should I be doing to make sure that when I go to apply for internships I can at least stand among the others that will apply?Personal projects and maybe some part time jobsinternships at local tech companies can make you stand out. Competing in programming completions as you are currently doing is great to put on a resume too. Apply to tech companies around the country for summer internships. Standing out only gets you the callbackinterview though so make sure you know your stuff so you can actually land the position though! Personally I would also recommend learning about version control agile methodologies scrum and well regarded books such as the Pragmatic Programmer. ,cscareerquestions,csrv1uj,10,t5_2sdpm

The reason startups tend to use these technologies is because compared to something like JavaSpring you can build out prototypes ship and iterate extremely quickly. I dont really know what native mobile devs use because Im not a native mobile dev. Obviously Android is Java and iOS is ObjectiveC. I saw a neat PyCon talk about Kivy which is a framework for building multiplatform mobile applications in Python. I think its still pretty experimental though. I will tell you that the popular architecture these days is to build out a serverside RESTful API for your product and just have your mobile apps feed off of data from the API. The API handles all the business logic and spits out JSON or XML or some other neutral format for other applications to consume. So lots of backend web engineers are building services which are technically also the backends of mobile applications meaning some of what used to be mobile work is shifting away from mobile engineers. This kind of architecture is so common that Rails  includes a framework for building APIonly applications to serve this need. ,cscareerquestions,csygrmh,2,t5_2sdpm

I TEACH web development for heavens sake!Maybe they considered your answer to be technically inadequate? The one your wrote in your original post works fine as an ELI answer but someone interviewing an experienced developer may have wanted a more indepth one instead.Your stressors may leave the interviewer with the impression that you use padding to cover up the fact that you dont know how it actually works. For example you mentioned buying certificates from Verisign but never explained certificate chains trusted root CAs and CRLs. You mentioned the word handshake but didnt go into detail about negotiating a faster symmetric cipher and only using the asymmetric one to exchange the shared secret see uUpAndDownArrowss response.Bottom line is that you shouldnt use simple answers unless you are explicitly told to do so.

GPA and went from audiovisual job to audiovisual job which I hated. Two years ago I got a job at a state university doing audiovisual and IT work which had the benefit of tuition remission and I started a second degree in computer science at a state school which provides online classes. Im still six credits away but I recently accepted a junior software developer position at a large firm. How does that apply to you? Find a way if you want to do it. There are places like Free Code Camp and The Odin Project that teach web development Free Code Camp if you take it seriously and do each of the exercises provides opportunities to do projects for nonprofits. I imagine a personal portfolio using the tech learned at free code camp and a couple of projects for nonprofits could land you a job. But this is the sort of thing that would take one or two years. But once you land a junior software development position get experience youll be able to make a living doing it. You just have to work hard and be persistent. And Im sure many state university systems have a setup similar to mine. I saw you mentioned youre autistic. I have no idea what thats like and Im not going to try to give you advice about that. Im sure there are people who can help you with socialization skills. Im sure there are employers who if you explained that would be more than happy to work with you. One thing that I cannot stress enough if you work at it explore all the possible options and be patient you can find a way to make it becoming a software developer happen. Four years ago I was dumped in a horrible horrible manner. I had dealt with depression a lot of my young life Im now  btw had been in an abusive relationship and then dumped. I had no longterm plan. I had no concrete goal. I was lost. All of this only added to the depression or the depression made things seem even more hopeless. But I found a therapist got medication worked on psychological issues made moving to a different city because my current girlfriend got a new job work for me i.e. I got a new job that provided the tuition remission benefit and now I have new career.

Personally I dont think thats a very good attitude to have.  Once it is established that the wrong path has been taken continuing on that path is usually nothing more than an accumulation of technical debt.

If your end school does not have an equivalent of Java  or does not see the community colleges course as an equivalent you will have to redo the course when you go for the degree after graduating.

Since my sophomore year of college I wanted to work as an algorithmic trader upon graduation I interviewed as a proprietary trader at multiple market makers in Chicago. If I can give you any advice its to do computer science and computer science only. Also  be very very good at it. To be a true algorithmic trader youre going to need an advanced degree and a very good grasp of mathematics or statistics or at the least a very strong bachelors degree with immaculate grades and a good connection to the company.  Either way youre going to have to be very very smart. In my opinion youll be more prepared if you focus on computer science or double in something like statistics or mathematics.

If the job was easy they wouldnt need to bother with job interviews and could just outsource.gt after a few questions i really try and hold back because im scared im pissing them offUnless they say so thats unlikely.  If it worries you dont assume just ask.  Programmers are stereotypically rather blunt about such things.  Youll probably piss them off more by hacking up something half assed out of ignorance rather than asking how to do it right in the first place.  And a certain amount of half assed hacking will still happen and is expected.  It may even be the expected solution but knowing when you are entering that jumping off point and should ask if there is a better way is a VERY useful skill at all levels.gt Is it normal to take a long time to get used to all the classesmethods related to a specific problem at a company?Absolutely.  Ive been doing my job for almost two years now working in a single custom framework and still learn new things about it.  Each time I learn something new I am able to do later tasks a bit more elegantly or can hack up something nasty that does something the framework creators never anticipated and would be horrified by.  Hell the company recently paid to have the framework creators fly in from Europe and spend  days going over the framework design with me and my coworkers even the ones who dont write code just so we would understand it better.  Plane tickets plus salary for a dozen people for three days aint cheap so obviously knowledge transfer is not expected to happen by magic!

In terms of other people at my agelevel I know midcareer Id say about  have some version of their name and the rest have something along the lines of what you have.Heres when it becomes a problem when that username or any variation thereof if its something very unique is also associated with accounts on other sites that you wouldnt want your employer to see. For example not too long ago we had a candidate whose github alias was a nonname...which upon a quick google was the same as his reddit username pretty obviously the same person judging by various posts and his reddit account was definitely not filled with stuff that would make anyone want to hire him. Ultimately that was far from the only reason my team chose to hire someone else. But if it had been between him and an otherwise identical candidate who didnt have a reddit account full of weird opinions that made him sound like an ass and like a very difficult person to be around I doubt that would have helped.The obvious I hope other situation in which a nonname username is a bad idea anywhere on your resumeapplication is when the username itself might be offensive to some people.

Back up this documentation on paper or some storage he cant destroy before a court takes it into custody. Not saying he will but I would not be surprised if this ends in litigation and you need to save your ass.Some people including your boss dont understand the amount of work needed to provide a solid software experience. He probably thinks an app our webpage rubs smoothly so it must be easy to develop and maintain. Thats my guys for the short deadlines with just one developer hired at low wage. Id say watch out for yourself. Line up a new job before giving your notice. From the little I know of you and your boss my expectation of a likely scenario is  a. You resign giving two weeks notice. He looks for a new developer and once he fills the position hell send you out the same day with  hours of time to allow for knowledge transfer. b. You resign giving eight weeks and the same thing happens to you.  c. You stay on and he lays you off once it is deployed either because he didnt think he needs even one developer full time to maintain or because it works so poorly since you were given no time and no test data and he blames that on the developer. d. You ask for a raise and he fires you and hired someone for what he was paying you. . He hires someone to replace you.  . New person is flummoxed due to harsh working conditions and code put together under the flame of short deadlines.  . New person complains asks for more time sucks quits or does some combination of these things. a. Boss still doesnt get it but regardless of how you left hell crawl back and beg you to finish it out. Dont expect a good work life still because if he doesnt understand he never will but you have big negotiating space. More money more strict hour cap or overtimeandahalf pay. You decide what to do. b. His business folds and even if he has no case especially because you documented what happened and have evidence to help you. Talk to a lawyer about how you can store this legally? He might try to get rich quick in a different way by suing you as the problem. Even if he has no case if he does have a lawyer willing to help him youll need to defend yourself. c. Launch goes poorly clients sue company then he passes the buck to you. Same story as b.Protect yourself before you wreck yourself. My suggestion again Brush that thin later of dust off your resume. Update it but request potential employers dont call current employer. Have another job ready to go to then give your two weeks.

However I will say that I probably did have more opportunities compared to other folks so thats why I dont really care. I dont like it but I also dont care.

5203776,0,t3_3m7uar,Air Guard split between enlisted and officer for well over  years.  In this time Ive worked for a defense contractor and a financial institution.  The defense contractor was made up of a large percentage of ex and retired military.  There was never an issue with taking time off from work but most of my extended periods away had at least a month or two warning.  If I needed to go way for an emergency event that was a couple of days or a week they didnt care.  Like the others said they gave  days military leave where I would get paid the difference between my military pay and civilian pay.  After that everything was unpaid leave.  My job with the financial institution was much the same  days military leave unpaid after that.  One of my training events ended up getting extended by a few days making it nearly a month long and they didnt have an issue.  Honestly for the most part as long as you are a hard worker and keep them in the loop they wont make a big deal about it.  As to the one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer for the most part this has been the case with the Air Guard.  Occasionally well have a few extra days or week we have to pull a year but for the most part it sticks to the normal plan.  Based on conversations with my buddies in the Army and Marines this isnt necessarily the case with them.  Again they are all guardsman so it could be different in the reserves.  They seem to have a lot of extra days that they have to pull when leading up to a Warfighter or some other joint exercise.  Instead of just drilling over the weekend they would come in two extra days each month during the week.  If youre the kind of person who thinks you should be treated special because youre in the military then youll probably be treated like a snob and given a hard time when you have to go away.  I doubt that is going to be the case for you but Ive seen it with other people.When you start to get an idea for what area you want to work start asking and searching online for how they are with the military.  Some companies are very generous and will provide more than the typical    weeks of straight pay or pay diff.  One thing Ive noticed in working in an area with very few military is that everyone thinks I get extra vacation at work because I have to go away for a few extra weeks each year.  ,cscareerquestions,cvd8xxa,2,t5_2sdpm

5237261,0,t3_3mp9a9,First of all Id like to say that the best source of information on university application processes is the university itself. Muster up some courage and email the unis youre interested in and ask them some questions trust me they are more than willing to help.Source for the further stuff Currently studying at a uni in the UK did a lot of research when applying.Maths is definitely hands down the most important subject pretty much every CS program here requires you to have an A in Alevel maths. Further maths is of great help and is practically a requirement at places like oxbridge and imperial  they seem to first offer interviews to people doing FM and if there are places left they start looking elsewhere. If you can I would strongly recommend taking FM and if its not offered at your school I would suggest taking a look at the further mathematics support programme I was greatly peeved when I found out about FMSP in my last year though I did the IB but Alevel FM would have still been recognized.Physics is not required in any way for computer science here in the UK not unless youre taking a degree that called CS  EE or something. However physics is a challenging subject and is respected more than Alevel CS which from what Ive heard is not particularly challenging. When I was doing my research I think one of the Cambridge colleges had a blacklist of Alevel subjects which they considered too easy and basically ignored when evaluating you  one of these subjects was Alevel CS. Other unis might not be as strict but physics will look better to them than CS.Now Ive said all sorts of things but having maths and  As is still the most important factor in getting into a uni because if you wont get that even if you have an offer you wont be accepted. So if you really dont feel like taking FM and physics then dont but I would highly recommend that you do and work a lot to get into a good uni. The CS market in the UK is pretty bad right now and graduating from a good uni might just make the difference between getting a software job and working as a janitor at McDonalds.,cscareerquestions,cvha39l,2,t5_2sdpm

5247161,0,t3_3mve8w,Im seeing two questions here.What Skills does asr dev have that a jr dev doesnt? Breadth and depth basically. A Jr dev with a bit of training can often be as good as a senior dev at any given task  of the time. So the big difference is that a Sr. Dev a has experience with a wide variety of work and can immediately contribute to a wide variety of tasks without training and b that last  of the time that requires deeper knowledge.Related to this senior devs are senior because they know the WHOLE stack. Or at least most of it. Theyve been involved in starting up new projects and completing them. They know about setup deployment debugging process potential risks etc.Where a junior may know one technology or language a senior dev typically has experience with many which not only gives himher more options but allows himher to better evaluate new technologies.A good senior dev also knows what is really important and what canshould be cut.They know about hidden pitfalls that could hurt the team in the long run.Having seen projects from beginning to end they have an idea of how long things take when something is behind schedule and what can be done to get things done on time. They can give good estimates and make good schedules.Finally whether they like it or not they have a feel for office politics of software development. They know whats worth fighting for and how to fight for it. They know how to talk to nontech people. How to manage mangers and what is worth spending money on.And on and on.In the end there isnt really a shortcut to becoming senior partially because a lot of what you can learn you cant speed up like seeing projects through to completion and dealing with management and partially because in general most good devs are giving it their all too.As I said. A good senior dev has breadth and depth. Many junior devs can code and problem solve just as well as any senior dev and with a bit of study could know anything the senior dev knows. But the senior dev has been doing that for years as well as just having a lot more experience.Just keep studying reading taking an interest. Work on learning the guts of the tech you work with as well as getting experience with many different techs. Work on your people skills. Pay attention to what is going on beyond your own code. Focus on creating value.Be the person who brings value. Who doesnt just get things done but helps the company succeed. ,cscareerquestions,cvigzsy,3,t5_2sdpm

So while I agree with you logic I dont believe HR would agree with you and HR are the people we are trying to convince.Its kinda like putting environmental compliance software in a vehicle that only activates when the car is being tested for environmental compliance.  Defending it by saying the test is implemented it in a way that you can bypass its intended design is true but its still dishonest.

These threads are showing that clearly this is not the case. There are too many variables and that is exactly what this proves. That cost of living by itself is a poor indicator of ones achievable net worth.

This is what happens when you work in a competitive industry that rarely posts jobs.    gt I have heard the saying you work for the least amount of money you will accept.Thats a shitty saying.

Sometimes the benefits outweigh a higher salary elsewhere.  Location commute ability for working remote worklife balance learning the actual work culture of the team and what it will do to get you to the place you want to be are all major factors.

As a result I knew that I would get rejected a lot but thought I could maybe fit in somewhere. Had interviews or had interview requests from Uber Bloomberg Garmin a startup in Virginia Sonoma Technology and Epic Systems. Also took a coding test for Zillow.Was rejected form about an equal number of companies. But above all else I learned that most companies dont respond at all or are really bad about following up. Plenty of companies I havent even heard back from. Others took  or  weeks. Even companies I interviewed with took weeks to give me feedback. I took that  hour online Epic exam  weeks ago and still havent heard back from them. I only heard back from Garmin in the last few days and I interviewed with them weeks ago. Its very interesting how disorganized some companies are. Everything turned out very well in the end though. Uber extended me an offer which I accepted. Pretty stoked about it. It will be pretty interesting in the next few weeks to see which companies that I recently applied to want me to come interview. Obviously will have to politely decline as I am beyond thrilled with working at Uber this summer! EDIT Forgot to mention one of the best parts. I was denied by Twitter in roughly  hour and  minutes.

You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than coming into a tech startup slinging some bullshit mobile app at the ground floor and making it to an acquisition with enough equity to make up for the money you could have made if you had just worked at an established company particularly a highpaying one.  Get your k started early and get some experience.For every multimillion dollar headline acquisition you read about there are literally thousands of bootstrapped startups that fizzle and die with only debt or years lost to show for it.  It doesnt even look good on a resume as others have noted.I should also point out that as a developer with a CS degree your are not gaining anything by learning how to market productize or do business development unless youre a shitty developer and need to change careers early in.  At real companies they have entire departments who do all of those things and they arent going to listen to what some developer has to say about their marketing strategy because said developer frittered away  months at an incubator out of college.  Even if your ideas are fantastic and objectively better theyll ignore you anyway because asking advice from development will make the business development and marketing teams look bad and they have their own careers to worry about.,cscareerquestions,cwfere5,3,t5_2sdpm

5536649,0,t3_3qyd7r,Perhaps you can change your mindset as to not be so discouraged. I have been thinking a lot about this actually as of recent as I see friends or people younger than me do bigger and better things than I have. This applies not only to programming but to a lot of other things in my life such as music as well. I think there are a few main things to really change your perspective about this.. Its okay to be jealous or envious of other people. In fact I would argue that without this emotion I would have settled for a far less competitive lifestyle and ultimately not worked myself to as high as a potential as I couldve. See these people as goals to match or beat  if they can do it you can too. I mean you said it yourself you are hardworking and you study a lot though you should consider putting more emphasis on your social life... I advocate for a balance of all parts of your life.. Get rid of a me vs. the world mentality. So what if people are smarter than you? There will be people younger that are smarter and more successful than you. There will be people the same age that are smarter and more successful than you. There will be people older than you that are smarter and more successful than you. Frankly I think its a good thing to not be the head of the pack all the time. You cant really learn as quickly if you have no one more experienced than you. The people who are smarter than me in my life have guided me much more than I couldve done alone. . Perhaps youre not studying as efficiently as you can be. Are you just glazing through books or are you actually building things? I find that the latter helps me learn magnitudes quicker than just reading something. Identifying what kind of learning suits you best will help you quickly adapt to new knowledge and at the very least it helps me save time on studying and allows me to have a life outside of academics. Glad you dont feel like you have imposter syndrome  I dont know what you mean by its not true but if you are confident in yourself to continue growing as a programmer or just a person in general youre well positioned to do so. When I think about the people that have done more than me I dont really see anything negative about it. I grin and vow to catch up to them because I know I can. Sounds like you have the same confidence in yourself too  so figure out whats slowing you down in terms of studying and perhaps look at your peers with a different lens.,cscareerquestions,cwjctcr,4,t5_2sdpm

5591427,0,t3_3rp66i,Congrats!  Ill try to answer your questions as best as I can because I was in the same spot as you last year.gt How long does this typically take?It can range from a few weeks to months.  It always helps to checkin with your recruiter.  It is better to seem needy than not to ask.  For me it took a really long time.  I got into hostmatching late November and got an offer in April.gtDoes this imply an offer in the future? What are the chances of getting rejected after getting to this stage?No.  It does not imply an offer although I heard they changed it up for some people this year.  I believe the chances are pretty slim but its still possible.gtHow much work does an intern actually do? As in how many features do they actually ship over the summer?This really depends on the project you get picked for!  A lot of interns work on internal tools some work on userfacing tools.  I worked the typical  with an outlined project and it essentially shipped I was on the Chrome team so its not in Chrome but it is in Chromium.gtWhat are the most commonly sought after projects? This is hard to say because as an intern we didnt have insight into what other interns wanted to do.gtWhich projects have the highest chance of getting selected as an intern? I know this sounds like a stupid question but this is not so that I will put that first. Im asking just so to know the full picture.Also pretty hard to answer but I think the most common team is AdWords since thats where Google makes all their money.gtWhat are the chances of getting selected as an intern in Search?Search is also a really big team and also Googles foundation so I think you have a fair chance of getting onto it. gtWhat are the most prestigious products in Google. I understand that there may not be such a thing but what do you feel from the back of your head?Hm I dont think theres anything in particular that I could think of but any of the Moonshot or Googlex projects are considered to be pretty cool.  This includes projects like the selfdriving car and loon.  I also think Fi is a great project as well.In general I dont think it really hurts to ask your recruiter these questions because thats what theyre there for and its not like its going to hurt your chances in hostmatching.  If anything itll show the recruiter that youre extremely interested in working at Google.  Also if youre like me and didnt have a particularly strong resume going in itll be hard to get matched with a host.  Something that I wish I started doing earlier was reaching out to my schools alumni to see if they had an open spot for an intern or knew anyone else that did.  I reached out to alumni midJanuary and I actually got a decent amount of responses but by then everyone I reached out to already filled their intern spots.Sorry I couldnt answer the last few questions that well.  Theyre really only questions a recruiter could answer.  Although Im sure they might not share all that information with you.,cscareerquestions,cwq63dc,1,t5_2sdpm
5592448,0,t1_cwpy1mc, Im glad youre looking at moving to Seattle! Its definitely a great place to live  and dont worry about spending too much on trying new places  never once did I regret it I just realized I might want to cut down at some point in the future. Im almost done discovering everything though.My sq.ft. if it matters BR costs me month after all utilities and internet. The big drawback of my place is that it doesnt have AC which this summer was required after it hit C that one weekend I was so glad I bought an external one to hook up to my window or a washerdryer inunit it has a laundry room but Im beginning to regret not having one inunit due to the relative terribleness of the machines there. The other places Ive looked at in the area of comparative value  quality were minimum month not including utilities or internet so I made a mental note to hardcap it at  allin. I dont think I made a terrible choice but Im definitely moving if my rent goes up next year. Especially considering the two friends in my building pay month less than I do allin.This is personally speaking I dont know your situation but as a single guy living in Seattle this is my perspective I wouldnt recommend living in a burb unless youre OK with commuting traffic is notoriously bad in the morning and around pm I live a  minute walk from my work building which was about what I was aiming for in terms of distancetowork. Yes the rent is way cheaper but youre also really far from any of the cool places which tend to be where downtown is farther southeast towards the ID or north towards UDistrictFremont. Living anywhere in the middle usually means youll end up in an older building that sucks the building I live in just renovated all of the units so Im the first tenant postreno! or youll be paying way too much for the branding instead of for whatever factors actually matter for you.Hmm city attractions? I havent been to the Space Needle yet but Ive been meaning to go. The CityPass Ive heard is a good deal if you want to see the big attractions in Seattle aquarium FMP science centre etc but theres also Pike Place Market which you have to see as well as Pioneer Square. The Underground Tour is kind of cool but Id much rather recommend Seattle Free Walking Tours since I learned a hell of a lot about the history of Seattle as well as about Pike Place Market.,cscareerquestions,cwqanmk,1,t5_2sdpm

5689368,0,t1_cx2b4pp,. It sounds as though in your opinion the ITIL service management approach is no good. Thats fine not every one uses it. It was just one example of a certification I recommend for specific POs.  a. Again its definitely not used by everyone. Words like worthless are pretty strong considering its underpinned by widely used broader standards like ISOIEC as well as modeled by Microsoft. Also couldnt care less about anyone is pretty strong as well. Hopefully that wouldnt inhibit someones chances at your company as knowledge  whether needed or not  is never bad.. What? Reread the comment I made. I said I enjoy seeing certs and for certain positions I highly recommend them. Which is all true and furthermore holds no bearing on the industry as a whole. Id hardly call that irresponsible. You sound frustrated with certs or the desire from some companys to see them. Im hearing that you dont think theyre worth anything and that asking for them could be damaging. I appreciate that this is your opinion and would challenge you to consider that they may come in handy. Certifications can point to passion outside the work place an opportunity taken for further knowledge and a specialized insight into business processes.This is also why I encourage people to consider the bigger picture. ITIL may not be your companys chosen service management solution clearly however they do have a service strategy I guarantee it. If the strategy theyre using offered deeper knowledge and insight it would be advantageous for all persons involved developers included to gain such knowledge if it were accessible. Knowing the approach and direction can help you code more efficiently and it will help you become an asset to your company.Honestly it doesnt matter what you think or what I think.

5733052,0,t3_3tmlmo,Not really supposed to comment about the company while being employed but my experience has been generally positive.Its a roller coaster of emotion. Intense bouts of stress are often followed by elation as your code ships and the flywheel a major technical hurdle is crossed and the wheels of progress begin to turn. You are constantly growing never bored. You are always forced to be better than you were.My first year was shit. The first  months I had serious imposter syndrome felt too dumb to be there and didnt know why I had flown across the country . But at the time I was so proud to be at Amazon that I decided I was going to stick it out.My first review was  months in and was generally positive but I hadnt really accomplished enough to get anything so I think they gave me like  more a month. They said I was achieving the standard at the time.Following that I started gaining some control over my worklife balance but then my personal life fell apart. Girlfriend left me I was saddled with a pet I didnt really want to take care of and I was super out of shape and drank a shit ton. I started putting in less hours and focusing on time outside. The summer passed by I built a couple of products that were kind of false starts. They didnt really serve the purpose well that they were supposed to as I didnt really work backwards from the problem and build the thing right to solve the problem correctly. I kept getting these feature requests and just tried to do everything I was being asked without really thinking about if it was actually important for the team the product the vision of our org to actually do said activity.Something snapped in me after a while and I started focusing more on myself and trying to get out of my rut. I started working out more and seeing a therapist and that translated to me all of the sudden giving a shit about my career. I mean your job is where you spend most of your time awake every week. Its your livelyhood. If you arent proud to be there if you arent itching to be the best at it then why are you doing it?I first thought that a change of work environment would be nice. So I started shopping around at the other local shops  Facebook and MS  and studied for interviews. I got an offer at MS for almost K more a year but after thinking about having to commute everyday to redmond and work for the borg I decided that my future would be more exciting if I actually tried to kick ass at Amazon instead of giving up and taking it easy across the lake. Microsoft is cool and all but all the people I know who work there dont sound like they have exciting jobs. They arent fired up about what they do or very passionate. They also dont exhibit frugality which ultimately I think is dangerous in the long term. Their offices are super sleek and expensive. They have huge teams and each person gets a little tiny world of responsibility to worry about. It just doesnt seem like microsoft is very cool.I also realized my team was unique at Amazon at least in my eyes. I had a friend who was put into like the social media graph team and she hated it. Said she had too much responsibility her manager sucked she had to work a shit ton she wasnt working on what she was passionate about webdev. I had another friend that was complaining that the hiring bar in his org was fucked  he had SDEIIs on his team that didnt know they shouldnt mock out the datastructures in the java standard library. I had another friend who said he was looking for a new job because he was in business logic hell in some sort of asinine service team. It just seemed like I got the best out of all of them  a team that was part of the backbone of AWS with super intelligent people more than enough opportunity work to do for me to stake my claim and grow myself. I decided that moving to Microsoft would be taking the easy route and clearly I could go there any time I wanted to.So I took a huge raise and stayed. I still would have had higher base at Microsoft but considering I still have all this stock lined up for me to vest and considering Amazons stock price is insanely high right now I think Ill be doing ok money wise.I started working on the next generation of my project got design reviews and focused hard on solving a problem that my team was having  and only that problem. I started giving a shit about the vision and made sure that I was careful to evaluate each little feature request or customer requirement that came in as I believed in the customers opinion  but I felt that the customers reaction to my opinion was more important than just straight up listening to the customer first off. So I intentionally started saying no to being told what to do and started getting more fired up about what my personal contribution to this team was going to be  my product.Recently its been paying off. My project is slowly taking off and the flywheel is beginning to turn. I want it to work so badly because I know we are going to fail as an organization if we dont keep pushing this product along. Now Im being told Im a leader. Ive had multiple people come up to me and say they are surprised Im not promoted yet so I feel like if I keep this momentum going it will happen soon. Im told to watch how I act because junior members of my team are paying attention to me  scary. I dont think this would have happened if I took the easy route out and went to Microsoft.Yes I get into verbal arguments a lot with my coworkers. Sometimes I want to kill them and they are driving me insane. Sometimes I even get pulled into my managers office and asked to cool it. But sometimes they really really genuinely surprise me with how fucking smart they can be how awesome they can be and how much of a dumbass I am. I have a long way to grow. Its wierd because the people around me are growing as much as I am. Sometimes Ill be like sigh so and so is such an idiot they ask me dumb questions and never write unit tests and the next week I get a CR from them that has  unit test coverage that they figured out how to implement on their own and I just smile. Ive been humbled there multiple times over and over.The environment is not for everyone. Its not a place for people who just want a paycheck. Its not a place where you will get a lot of love and support  you do have to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps and try your hardest to carry your own weight. But the reward you get when you start figuring stuff out  not just the technology but also the people and the culture really begins to pay off. Do I think Ill stay there forever? Probably not.

I mean having it is nice but I wont scrutinize it as long as you have it. The big thing will be how you do on technical screenings. Most people come in with awesome resumes but suck at whiteboard coding. And Im not talking like Google interviews where I expect you to know some esoteric CS factoid. Im talking like implement something simple that does x y and z. A lot of people cant do that. Its crazy.Version control and unit testing will be great after you get hired to know those.

5759329,0,t3_3txk4s,I would agree with Banjoplayer. I graduated with an online degree and the downside is lack of networking and socialization. As far as knowledge goes I dont think youre going to be at some significant disadvantage compared to the general population. Of course it may not be as good as Princeton UC Berkeley MIT etc. but at the end of the day a shit ton of people have succeeded without going to those schools. Also quite a few of those schools have their courses posted publicly online and you can easily take advantage of that. Pros In most cases cheaper You learn to go after the knowledge instead of expecting someone to teach it to you Learn to manage yourself in general Convenient allows you to be flexible to work parttime time jobs to pay off schoolCons Making friends is difficult Lack of networking Possibly harder math courses due to lack of inperson teaching for me at least I found that math is probably the only subject I would want an actual physical teacher available to meIt took me  years to get my degree while living with friends or parents to reduce overall costs. Ended up holding a job for  out of those  year and graduating with  in debt which was federal.  years to pay off .k kish after interest? Turns out to be roughly  a month and kish less than the national average. Everyone I know that is fresh out of college have roommates. The software engineers project managers and similar higher paying jobs probably dont need a roommate but it definitely helps towards paying off their loans. In my case I live alone have always wanted to and and save more than enough every month to live happily. Just make sure you consistently study algorithms and data structures because those are what most interview questions will target.

The majority of people who live and work in NYC do not live in Lower Manhattan. Areas outside of Lower Manhattan are actually relatively affordable compared to SF and the Metro is the best public transit system in the United States.For example bdrm in Lower Manhattan is about Kmo comparable to SF. But you can live right outside of Manhattan or Upper Manhattan and pay like  less for a  minute commute which isnt bad because you dont even have to drive its a nice time to read a book or listen to some music. Going out isnt an issue even if you have a commute since the train runs . I had way more trouble going out when I lived  minutes outside of SF by car.I live in Upper Manhattan and my commute to Flatiron District is about  minutes door to door but Im paying like  in rent for a room in a bdrm vs much more if I lived downtown.

Was made  time  hoursweek when someone quit and took over some sys and database admin responsibilities and continued doing content development. Proposed an efficiency improvement plan that I wanted to enact if made full time to the founder he accepted and restructured a bit and also made our lead developer the general technical lead. Did a lot of devops stuff cut back on some of the sys admin stuff and learned more about the server side legacy C code. Technical lead is the type who thinks lead means I get to work on what I want and not care about what anyone else is doing as long as it doesnt negatively impact what I want to do rather than someone who leads the team. I take over supervising the content and tech support teams he manages the sysetc admins. He leaves for another job thats more pure programming I take over his role.

I suppose it depends on how much time you want to spend putting details in the stories during planning or if you would rather rely on the open communication.Usually these are questions that came about because of something unknown at the start or an assumption that turned out to be untrue.  Maybe the dev discovered something while working that would make the implementation slightly different.  Developers need to be aware of goldplating features or of misinterpretation because of a miscommunication.You could wait for the end of the sprint build tospec and simply bring these up at the demo but if the PO or stakeholder is right there why not just ask them and save time?

5861224,0,t3_3vhswk,Some secondhand data points for Indonesia. I used to live there and still have some contacts with Indonesian software engineers Most good IT jobs are in Jakarta the capital city. Annual starting salaries are roughly between . Theres a startup bubble going on right now that drive salaries upwards. Expert engineers architects etc can get between between  per year. The above level is pretty much the salary ceiling for you if you stay on the engineering track. Managements are valued much more than engineering so a lot of Indonesian engineers switched track to projectteam management after  years of engineering. Experiences working abroad are highly valued. As a seniorlevel engineer with years of working experience outside Indonesia I had an offer of  per year to join the BoD of a VCfunded startup as CTOChief Architect.The cost of living is relatively cheap though. For twostory  bedroom house in the suburb the mortgage is somewhere around  per month. Renting costs around the same.Median household income is around  per year in middleclass Jakarta so a software engineer working as the sole breadwinner can easily provide good life for a family of four without necessitating the family to switch to dualincome mode.,cscareerquestions,cxnxpdb,8,t5_2sdpm

He was offered a position but it wasnt development.On any given day the people hiring you will be in a different mood. They may not ask the same questions or might interpret what you said differently. Maybe they had a bad day and were less charitable in one interview than another. Or maybe you knew that one thing they were interested in better than the other candidate. Hiring is not a science its very much impression based. You cant know if it was your gender or nationality or just how the interviewers day was going. Do you know for sure you even had the exact same interviewers? Or that the questions matched? They are also looking for potential or any signs that there could be an incompatibility with the team. Maybe signs saying this person is going to complain about the tools we use or lower morale. Good grades and an internship mean youll get a job somewhere but it doesnt mean youll get a job in any specific place.Humans are complex.

6041602,0,t3_3y9428,I think the change will happen with the younger generation if programming is introduced to schools. Since how its been at least from how Ive seen it majority of schools primary and secondary dont have any programming courses or if they do theyre definitely not a requirement. So a lot of people have to just fall into CS either having a family member thats shown it to them or they completely fell into it on their own accord or they decide to just enrol in it as thats the career they like the idea of but have not experienced anything yet. For instance being from a lower socioeconomic family I never had a computer until I was late  it was a result of that that led me to getting into programming started fiddling around with games and started making game hacks. If it wasnt for that I never wouldve thought about programming my hobbies and interests were far from it at the time. I think thats too late many who might have found they really enjoy it never even consider it when it comes time to pick their degree or career as they never got to experience it. Or possibly those that did consider CS again without prior experience may get turned off because of the things you mention low level of diversity. So to solve that I think exposing people at a younger age to it through schooling could improve the number of minorities and women that may choose to enter the field. Since if youve already experienced it and found you really enjoy it then youre more likely to go on to do that. I remember seeing a talk by some teacher at a private girl school who had introduced an electronics engineering class. And students they had up on stage showcasing their projects had made some pretty neat things but more importantly seamed like they really enjoyed it. Thats what we need to see I believe just obviously not limited to private schools but its a really cool start. ,cscareerquestions,cybkbea,1,t5_2sdpm

6050179,0,t3_3ydoe5,The honest answer is that no one knows whether or not you can become a software developer.  The only way to find out is for you to try actually learning something.  A question like this gets asked every  days and each person asking this question has a unique set of circumstances. Some people will be successful. Some people wont be. If your choices are to become a plumber or to become a software developer I am a bit scared to provide constructive feedback. Not because I have something against plumbing and plumbers but because the sets of skills are very different. At this point it almost looks random.  Your best bet is to start with an Associate degree in computer science at a community college. Yes you can use a lot of online resources to learn programming. The problem is there are a lot of resources. CC intro to CS sequences take care of it by providing you with the knowledge you really need to get started. If you can do CS I CS II and CS III data structures you will be able to successfully continue further.  Another reason why taking classes is better than selfstudy in situations like yours is you get someone your instructor to be a gauge of your success. They will provide timely feedback on how you are really doing.,cscareerquestions,cycoji2,3,t5_2sdpm
6052987,0,t3_3yfkah,As a senior about to graduate in May my advice to you is to not worry so much about the social life of college. Your classes may not be looked at by employers at the end of your college career when your applying however dont take the easy way out just so you can have a social life or to pursue projects. What I did was follow the curriculum and I did all my work before I did anything for myself. I learned one new programming language every year. During my winter and summer breaks I would come up with projects to work on and put them on GitHub. I cant give you an exact answer for what you should do. I didnt get a lot of free time in college because I found CS to be hard but rewarding. It ate up a lot of my time but I still went out on the weekends and I made friends and had fun when I could. I also got involved with my Schools CS club ACM and I made good connections with my professors and did many projects on their time and my time as well. Im not trying to brag Im just trying to show you that you dont need to worry about being overwhelmed. The best thing I can tell you is that CS is hard its demanding on your time. However side projects are exactly what they mean projects for on the side when you have time. Dedicate your breaks to projects and dedicate your semesters for school projects and your classes. The last thing Ill tell which is a little off topic is dont forget why you are there! College today is sort of advertised as a teenage wasteland. Dont forget your supposed to get a degree not master the art of doing a keg stand!EDIT if you have any other questions feel free to ask.

6238062,0,t1_cyynv0l,Amazon IS part of the Big  going by the usual definition here. Worklife balance for me there was fine pretty much all the devs I knew there seemed to have decent worklife balance too. Im sure there are some teams where the stereotypes are accurate but my hunch is that they dont apply to the majority of the teams there.Amazon was very useful for me getting into Google when I was in school Google wouldnt talk to me once I was at Amazon that changed. Google work life balance for me has been slightly better than Amazon mostly because there isnt pager duty on my team and also it just seems a bit more flexible with which hours you work overall. Number of hours I work is basically the same week usually including lunch.Its hard to ballpark the whole company at once but from what Ive seen and heard Id say Google work life balance is pretty average overall.

I was saving kyr in my k plus another k into my savings account. Im relatively frugal car was paid for etc but I definitely spent fairly freely on travel and hobbies. Most of my savings I plowed into buying my stock options before the company went public so I could hold them long term and pay a lower rate on them. Also dodged AMT. Worked nicely now own a house. Still putting k into my k but not as much savings on the side. Make more now though married got pretty got savings etc. In my experience the big paybig cost of living of the Bay Area is a gamble that totally pays off. Folks always talk about how stupid it is to live here and how they live in some low costofliving area but somehow theyre never rich and they have a lot fewer options. If you live somewhere expensive and reap the savings x in savings turns out to be a whole lot more in actual dollars in a high COL area you can always move somewhere cheaper.

6253231,0,t3_418nlo,Why are you getting a PhD? If youre getting a PhD to get any old job as a software engineer stop. Its a waste of time and money. The only reasons you should get a PhD in Physics if your end goal is to be a software engineer is if you just truly truly love the field and are willing to sacrifice your time and moneymakingpotential to research this field or if youre wanting to get into a highly specialized field related to your thesis.IMO if Im just looking to hire a smart software engineer in my startup PhDs are not my goto. . Fresh PhDs dont generally have industry experience. In a lot of facets of software development youre no better than someone fresh out of high school and I have to be willing to dedicate resources to teach you things like focusing on the right nonfunctional requirements effort estimation using CI tools testing etc. . Because of  you probably dont write elegant wellarchitected code that is easy to read and easy to maintain. . And even despite  being a PhD youre probably not going to accept the salary that Id be willing to give someone who has the qualities of  and  which is that of a junior developer.Of course there are exceptions but these qualities all apply to a LOT of people with science PhDs even those with CS PhDs.The only reason I would specifically look for a PhD is if Im doing something novel and I need their expertise for example if Im doing a startup that utilizes very modern techniques in natural language processing Id be willing to pay a lot of money to get someone whose PhD focus was on NLP or computational linguistics. All that being said I ask the question again Why are you getting a PhD in materials physics? Do you want to become a software engineer in the field of photonics and fabrications? Excellent. Get into the best materials physics labs you can and network within your field. Youll be able to find a job through that network. Do you just love the stuff and want any CS job afterwards? Keep up to date. Lightly work on some side projects contribute to some large open source applications read some good books on engineering practices like Clean Code. Learn new things. Itll be a struggle to do this while earning your PhD but will be your saving grace when looking to jump into the tech industry afterwards.,cscareerquestions,cz0farm,6,t5_2sdpm

This is probably the BIGGEST reason because it means that they have a vested interest in your success as a web developer.  VERY selective. They boast a  acceptance rate. Theres apparently multiple interviews coding exercises and A TON of prepwork which they strongly encourage you to undertake just to apply.

You just want a new outlet in a wall. But instalation in your house is made by a friend of a friend who was a total noob inexperienced junior dev who didnt make any photos before putting plaster lack of documentation. There is also some magic involved because as you connected your new outlet now switching on hairdryer switches off refrigerator and no one knows why. So you start hammering wall to find the cause.

6435873,0,t3_43u82i,My anecdotal evidence of how an open office can work contrary to everyone else here OPI work in an open office rows of desks and all and all of them able to become standing desks. No one is ever distracted from their work. Rows are side by side in pairs facing each other with a translucent wall in between thats just tall enough to where you can barely see over it so anything in front of you wouldnt distract you but not cubical walltall if that makes any sense. People normally have headphones in and are in the zone. No one minds the occasional chatter from nearby coworkers or gets distracted from it. And if you are we have private rooms our whiteboard rooms you can go in and use. Plus I dont mind talking and being social with my desk neighbors every now and then but then again Im not an introvert. Also my boss does not care if were not actually coding at our computer if she comes by. Im oftentimes on reddit and because I get my work done she doesnt care. We have  offices on the west coast and  of them are cube farms mine being the only open office. Our coworkers hate visiting the other  offices because of the cube farm layout.Open offices can work just fine. If youre easily distracted in one that seems more like just a personal thing which is ok. But the point is that the open office format and whether you like it or not is entirely dependent on who youre working with and how easily you can be distracted on your own. If you went by everyone elses responses here youd see that they couldnt focus on a movie if they had to and they apparently work for Big Brother always being watched over.Edit I guess the hivemind here really wants to push the opinion that open offices suck by downvoting anyone that says otherwise. ,cscareerquestions,czl09uj,-8,t5_2sdpm

Signed up with a few recruiting agencies and got six interviews in a couple of weeks with some smaller local companies. Some of these were terrible matches for my skillset the recruiter just threw me at whatever company they were trying to fill a slot for. Two interviews resulted in offers one at a small startup doing CRUD Java apps for medical billing and another more established company doing embedded systems for aircraft. I took the latter job even though it paid a little less because it was more interesting work and was in a more affordable part of the city.So I went from graduation to a k job in Los Angeles in about six weeks. But I just barely made it. Two months later my company instituted a hiring freeze and then there were two rounds of layoffs that I was lucky to avoid. And in  there were couple of furlough weeks mandatory unpaid vacation.

6505954,0,t3_44pe2g,Get a job in San Francisco before you move there. The quality of the job and company will dictate whether you enjoy living there. If youre working hour days at a sweatshop youre not going to get to enjoy the city. If all you want is to get out of your small city then expand your search Seattle Chicago Denver Austin etc.Ninety percent for a junior more like  of whats in San Francisco is the same mediocre stuff that you can find anywhere. Very few projects are better than what youd find elsewhere and without connections and pedigree youre unlikely to find that stuff unless you a take big risks and get lucky or b learn how to play politics. Also San Francisco is not Silicon Valley. The attitudes are different. San Francisco is like a crappier New York with warmer weather that becomes an SV annex whenever theres a VC bubble and a thirdrate financial hub distantly behind NYC and Chicago whenever theres not one. Silicon Valley is an ugly place to live suburbia office parks but has an RampD heritage going for it so theres a lot of good work out there. I think that most of the top jobs that make it worth it to put up with the Bay Areas bullshit traffic house prices phony liberalism are actually in Silicon Valley an hour drive from the city. So you may have to choose between your city and the plum job. Finally you have no idea what its like to live and work in a place as a rentpaying adult if youre under .

Honestly the gotchas are one of the strengths of FizzBizz it almost always give you a few predictable talking points you can see how they handle failure or criticism etc.Seriously. People just FAIL FizzBizz. Spectacularly. Its almost aweinspiring to see sometimes.Its so simple you cant just bluff your way through it and that seriously throws some people off who start talking about modules and algorithms and dependency injection and all kinds of other things but cant just show you how to use a switch statement or use the  operator.And important component of FizzBizz is you make it VERY clear this is not about being clever. This is a simple and obvious problem that can be solved using the most basic operation of any programming language. Its important to be forgiving in interviews and help people calm down.But a suprising amount of candidates claiming real programming experience who have worked at multiple large companies and can use buzzwords in convincing ways just cant actually program. At all. They work somewhere for a year or two copying stuff off the internet getting others to solve problems and making up very plausible excuses for the things they cant cheat around and jump from company to company throughout their careers never really accomplishing anything.Fizzbizz is great for catching those types.,cscareerquestions,czsfmvz,5,t5_2sdpm

From what it sounds like you have another  years of undergrad ahead of you which is plenty of time to hit it hard stay committed and get a good job in the field  that you will have to earn like everyone else.I am selftaught with degrees in Biology amp Psychology and while I can only speak from my own experience having this background has paid off however not until a few years into my professional career. I started programming and getting into other good stuff in the ol terminal when I was  years old granted that was  and the resources were shit until I graduated college but if I could go back I wouldve hit it a lot harder around my sophomore year. I spent the first  years most definitely fighting against the current in the hiring process and was underpaid compared to my peers as well. At this point Im  years in and earning kyear but it was one hell of a fight to get here.I dont know if this helps you at all so let me reiterate my point if you want to do this for a living youre going to have to prove yourself at some point to turn that asterisk by your degrees from a negative into a positive. If you can get an internship now and commit to the craft you should be able to do just what your friend did. If not your career experience is where youll prove yourself and its not a cakewalk. Take advantage of your one opportunity to make a great first impression as in your first job and set the tone right.,cscareerquestions,czytwbc,3,t5_2sdpm
6571394,1,t3_45mcud,I just politely emailed my recruiter I dont have his telephone number. If he does not reply I will email the other female recruiter I know. If this fails Ill ask to speak with a manager at the office. This company prides itself in customer service so Im sure something can be accomplished by doing this. However Ive decided to take these incremental steps this way when the manager asks if I tried these things I can say yes.The goal by the way is not to get this recruiter in trouble Im not vindictive like that.

That way you cant just minimize it to use Windows which forces you to really learn how to work with Linux. It will run on literally anything more powerful than a toaster so if you have a ten year old laptop then you could start with that.Yeah thats mostly why I want to install it on a separate partition over just using a VM. I used to use Ubuntu as a primary OS for a few months back in early  when I had no idea that I would have ended up going into Computer Science and I thought it was pretty cool. Ill probably figure out how to use it a little faster because of that but Ill certainly still be quite rusty.,cscareerquestions,czz245w,2,t5_2sdpm

I just have a perspective from both sides and see that metaphor tons of times and consider it wrong and also really arrogant.There is a lot of work that some developers do that can be considered just like a mechanic. Fixing simple bugs and testing for example. Usually the software they work on is proprietary too so it really is a lot like fixing someones car.gt My comment should be taken within the context of OPs question where he is on that lower tier IT.But then you compare it to lower tier development and it doesnt really work comparing those guys to automobile engineers.My only point is that what higher level IT people do is just as far away from breakfix computer repair work as any development job.,cscareerquestions,d00e3ro,1,t5_2sdpm

At my company youd get hired on at a level above BS students if you have a masters which pays more.Masters degrees tend to be where you get experience doing more specialized things.

Id say a masters degree would get you to working at spotify doing machine learning faster than trying to get it with just a B.S. if you had a goal of doing something like that.If youre not working full time while getting a masters I would say another plus of a masters is that it allows you several more years to get internships with companies you want to work for.

6788551,0,t3_48psbi,Well in my case I went from writing my first lines of code in Python to graduating and getting called in for interviews in two years and one month. During those years I got the benefit of formal college courses in CS so I learned a lot in a short time.For your case do your best to learn algorithms and data structures for specific tasks and about algorithms and data structures in general and learn how to analyze an algorithms timespace complexity in certain circumstances and on certain data structures dont know what timespace complexity are? Look it up and ask around.If youre not going to pursue coursework in CS then youre going to have to legitimize yourself with projects that you can put online to show off to people I use school projects of relativelylarge scale and some projects that are small but demonstrative of skill or understanding in a topic. Also youre gonna wanna see if youve got contacts inindustry. One of the best opportunities I have for good work has come from my best friend recommending to head of recruiting at a company he used to work at as a dev.You might be able to score an internship which you can get with little experience and then you can use that to legitimize yourself though you may have trouble with that because in my experience most internships require you to be enrolled in school at the time.After that start worrying about putting together a good resume and start submitting it. ,cscareerquestions,d0lrqsr,2,t5_2sdpm

6827160,0,t3_498e4k,I work full time from home right now. I cant give much advice on how to find one other than youll have to pass on a bunch of opportunities. Lots of places dont want remote workers even though our actual work is so easy to do remotely. Part of this is team building part of this is old school thinking. Even lots of big companies that went allin for things like super flex time remote working and infinite vacation have recanted them in the last few years. Yahoo and Best Buy to name a few.Slight tangent  this is also because many companies are weird when it comes to worklife balance. I worked at a company once where I got very stressed and HR wanted to talk to me. They said they recommended a minimum of  day off a month and more if possible. I said that sounds great but the company policy was  days a year. She said correct because we dont pay you to sit around. I almost got whiplash from that conversation.Anyway... as for advice working remotely I have a lot of that. Set up a dedicated office space in your home. This will enable you to switch off from work. This doesnt sound like a big deal but it is. Lots of people underestimate the effect that a commute has on being able to switch off their brains. Get a real phone line do not rely on a cell phone. The quality difference is pretty large actually and you dont want to be unreachable due to low battery  phone issues.  Likewise get a headset. Long meetings on the phone is awkward. Alternately use speakerphone on a real phone if you wont bother anyone. Get a speaker like a Sonos for music. Decouple it from your computer.  Realize that your connection to other people will drop significantly. This could be good or bad depending on your views but most people will be craving human interaction even if they have a girlfriendspouse. Your daily interactions chats etc will be virtual now so your human interactions will mostly be meetings and business. Its tougher than it sounds. Join a meetup if you dont have a group of friends you nearby. Dont forget to take breaks. People dont realize a lot of the time how much time people in offices are NOT working. You chat with friends run to the bathroom down the hall walk to and from meetings where you run into Steve from sales that you only see once in a while and chat for a while impromptu hallway conversations with people team lunches office management stuff fire drills elevator is out so take the stairs  flights up today etc. LOTS of breaks. Dont feel guilty for taking  minutes for lunch at home when youre just feet from your office.  Wear pants. Doesnt mean you have to dress up though some people will advise that. I have work pants that range from sweatpants to slightlynice pajama pants that I do not wear to sleep. Theres no need to be uncomfortable but you should feel comfortable walking outside in it.  Related to above  a surprising number of people stop by my house when I work at home. Usually just salespeople or whatnot but because I work from home its so convenient to get contractors to come over have services done and so on during the day. So I have to look somewhat presentable.  Make your office space comfortable and different. I painted mine fun colors nothing too crazy and got some new furniture to make it feel like a proper office.  Get lots of monitors. I have  screens currently in my workspace and am being shipped a fourth this week. Try not to get distracted. Working at home presents sooo many opportunities to get distracted. TV is right there. No one will notice if you watch Netflix on your home machine. Im guilty of using TV shows as background noise I treat it like other people do music though.I can probably come up with more or answer any questions you have.,cscareerquestions,d0q5php,3,t5_2sdpm

If anything it tells me the applicant does not have good time management skills and this is also a critical skill when you are working and get overloaded with work.

6946083,0,t3_4au64h,Ah yes the woes of beginning your career at an understaffed startup with few if any good coding practices. Ive been there. Most of the benefits of working in one is that it helps you be more of a selfstarter and become less reliant on others. On the other hand insufficient resources from lack of other inhouse developers can stunt your growth. I still dont understand what proper unit testing is like because I never worked at a company that did it.Also you dont have guilt to follow you if you leave the job. Its on the company to find a suitable replacement if you believe that their platform would be ruined without you working there.A year is a good time to start looking elsewhere for a job and just make sure to see what youre getting into. Ask questions like how many years has the company been in business local team size of developers and how is the development process like for starters.

I have a decent understanding of Core Java that isnt shown in the projects. I do understand things such as time analysis data structures etc.The problem with my school is that after Java  Java  and Discrete Math the other classes were C and Assembly and they were taught very poorly. Same with Data Structures. It was as if many of the teachers were so tied with certain regulations and time constraints that they never had the full time to teach us what we should know. It was honestly a lot easier to learn things on my own. I know that even if I would have completed we would have never learned about Web Frameworks SQL JSON etc.Its kind of sad in a way. The last class I took was a  credit Assembly course yet we didnt go into the lab once. It was all taught by the professor reading from the book and writing on the board.

7053325,0,t1_d1fqsh4,Depends if it is cash or not. You should basically never go wrong with making more money because of how tax brackets. Getting into a higher tax bracket only means that the part of your income in that bracket is taxed more. You wont lose money.But if you arent getting taxed at a higher amount then it depends on how much the company spends. For instance lets say you have a choice between a ksummer housing stipend which will cover about  of your housing costs and free corporate housing that the company is spending k amonth on. Taking corporate would be a bad choice. You would be taxed on the entire  whereas the stipend would only be a tax on .Id suggest taking the stipend. You will save money and if you are getting  a month for housing you will definitely be able find somewhere to live and save a bunch of money. You could probably spend a little less than  for the entire summer if you got a good deal. That said finding housing out of state is kind of a pain so Id start looking now. Corporate housing may be more convenient.Edit and Id take cash for relocation if you have a choice. If you have a car I would really think about driving it up there. I think they would at least cover your costs in driving up there if the details are lacking. And having a car available is convenient.,cscareerquestions,d1fuq6u,1,t5_2sdpm

I had other projects but that one seemed to always get brought up. I just talked compilers with a person for  minutes and then they would normally switch to talking about my internships. I never dealt with APIs that much but I had some frameworks I did a thing in Spring everything else has sort of died.But then again I was a Java developer by schooling so seeing a C project and an internship at a C shop Garmin for aviation I thought made me stand out a little. I was willing to go beyond just what I was taught in school and go shoot my foot learn C in a more in depth manner.I always thought that projects should have a double meaning. You show you are willing to selflearn. You show you are willing to step outside your comfort zone.

Does investing all that time and money seem wise?  this is coming from someone that was about to matriculate to medical school but opted for a career in software engineering instead. the grass is not greener unless medicine is what you want to do because youre passionate and cant see yourself doing anything else. if its lifestyle reasons youre making a bad decision.edit a big note is that the future of medicine is very uncertain given the huge push for universal healthcare politically. physician salaries are predicted to significantly decline in the upcoming decades  or more if universal healthcare is realized. ,cscareerquestions,d1qcpnl,4,t5_2sdpm
7145901,0,t1_d1phxu5,I just wanted to point out how important the cultural aspect of this is.In Germany it is illegal not to take your vacation. So if youre in a whirlwind of activity youre in the flow etc. the government will force you via fines to drop everything youre doing and take time off. This happened recently to my friends big data team  half the team including the head of big data had to take a vacation during the project launch.I initially liked this idea of a  week vacation... until I found out that I have no choice in that matter. At least in the US I could choose  work for a company that will grind me down or work for a company that will give me all the time off I need.These kinda things go much deeper. I only came to appreciate both the value and costs of economic freedom that the US gives only after I left it when I moved to Germany. Every time I hear an American extolling the virtues of social democracy health insurance vacation etc.  I ask myself whether theyve actually lived under that kind of system. And this comes from someone who immigrated to the US started off stocking shelves at min. wage and slowly clawed their way into a decent life doing something they dreamed of  software dev.,cscareerquestions,d1qewvq,2,t5_2sdpm

Most jobsthings have downsides and it can be very hard to be grateful for what you have while you have it.Not saying you cant complain but I found I appreciate my job much more when I look for silver linings. For example I get to listen to music have some coffee and chat with you right now. Not all jobs have these perks.If you find yourself consistently lacking energy and joy in life Id recommend some mental help  therapy. My work has an anonymous employee assistance program and my life vastly improved after I went. Its not good or healthy to always be in a bad mood.

I saw a thing about security and I thought What the hell Ill post internally and see what happens. I got the new gig. Im still utilized as more of a software engineer but I am brought on some of our fire drills and quick fixes.I do know we are looking for some colleges that offer security engineering and security programming degrees or universities that specialize in Cyber Security I think UTDallas is one we look at. If you do end going after a CS degree see what advanced courses in security that the university offers and whether or not they typically actually have enough students for those classes to make.In short getting a CS degree and then learning security on the job is how I got into it. Other people specialize in college.

Thats what networking is figuring out how your work life can be mutually beneficial not how you can be best buddies.

It sucks because the lines blur when you quit your lose your friends and its hard to get promoted if youre one of the guys and in the case of a female you have the added difficulty of seeming flirtatious. I have a few close friends Ive met at work but the majority of them are just colleagues and I try to establish a primary social life outside the context of work which admittedly can be tricky if you work a lot.Also anything involving alcohol keep it at  drinks max.

7270921,0,t3_4eysan,Im a recent Western Grad  Its a really excellent program given the schools size and status as a directional university. The program is rapidly growing unfortunately but if you take the right professors you can get a world class education for half of the cost of UW. Of course if you get into UW CS you should go but the program has more than a few excellent students who didnt get accepted to UWs CS program and transferred. Things to like about WWU CS . The professors  the good professors are really really good. Phil Nelson Michael Meehan Brian Hutchinson Perry Fizzano Aran Clauson and Bover in particular stand out for me as truly excellent well qualified teachers I had that gave me an amazing education. I havent taken many of the newer professors but they seem to be excellent as well. . The campus  Bellingham rocks. The campus rocks. It is a gorgeous place to spend  years of your life among openminded friendly people. The party scene is good and there is a lot to do. . The price  dear god. Western is SO cheap for the quality of education you get. For less than k a year in tuition you get an amazing education. I wasnt able to pay for a more expensive option and Western was great to me giving me merit scholarships every year I attended in one way or another. . The connections  There are lots of WWU alums working in Seattle and yes even at Microsoft Amazon and Google. I lined up a  figure job before graduation and I know Im not the only one from my class to do so. The key as always is to work hard do internships get good grades and network.  . The lab environment  the school provides several computer labs and it is a really excellent place to learn and collaborate with your fellow students. The building has a ping pong table and giant whiteboards. The machines support working in Linux and with a networked file system. . The math department  you will learn math and learn it well as a part of the program. We have a great math department that emphasizes a visual style of teaching calculus and I think its extremely effective. A couple drawbacks. The name  No one knows about WWU outside of Seattle. They will not be impressed with the name on your degree but then again it is ABET accredited for whatever thats worth. . The isolation  Bellingham doesnt have much of a tech scene so any interning you do will probably have to be in the summers. Is it perfect? No. Is it Harvard or even UW? No. But for the price WWU is an incredible opportunity to learn strong CS fundamentals. If you truly work hard learn to interview well do an internship and of course get a little lucky I guarantee you it will be possible to land that sixfigure job coming out of WWU when you graduate. Im so proud to call myself a Western alum. Hope you decide to come!,cscareerquestions,d24nkm0,4,t5_2sdpm

Like using the iOS article as a guide at what point are you employable? Beginner intermediate or advanced?Unfortunately Im not a recent grad living in my parents basement. I have two kids of my own so I cant just focus all day long on a prospective career without major time pressure. I have about two hours of free time a day and that needs to be split across job hunting classes and my side project. If I felt I was nearly employable I might quit my job and go full steam ahead but I cant put my familys livelihood at risk until I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. ,cscareerquestions,d2d31qv,1,t5_2sdpm

People who are well liked get promoted faster as people enjoy working with them. There are people at my work that are wildly incompetent but have kept their jobs for decades because people like them. Those people stand around talking for hours every day. I personally hate it. I dont want to talk to anyone either and have nothing to say to these people but people dont understand that.

7516800,0,t3_4ia57r,It depends. Early on a project I spend a lot more time thinking through a problem. For instance I just started a new project at work that should take  weeks. I spent the first week doing a lot of writing estimating and talking to coworkers about how to approach implementation. The only coding Ive done is exploratory and usually in  minute chunks at most. Near the end of project when I have a really clear sense of what needs to be done I can go for  hours straight with quick breaks to get coffee or stretch between. but sometimes if Im in the flow I wont even do that  there have been days where Ive coded  hours nonstop. I generally dont feel tired at the end of the day although if I do its usually not because of coding commuting sucks and meetings can be draining. A lack of focus IMO is usually just a symptom of lack of purpose. If you are constantly switching contexts or between exploration and implementation you arent going to be productive. When you have a defined task with defined objectives i find it much easier to focus. ,cscareerquestions,d2wmflj,1,t5_2sdpm

You started spewing wildly inaccurate facts do you realize you arent legally required to pay me? and made vague accusations. Do you really wonder why you werent received positively? Its obvious the CEO believed you were accusing him of being a scam artist and he was right to feel that way. Im surprised he didnt ask you to leave and not come back.gt Things got even weirder when he quickly typed out a list of bullet points the terms of the offer and asked if Id be okay signing that with him...and then the cherry on the cake was him offering me A PAYCHECK right there and then so that I may trust him. What is this bribery? Is this a normal thing for startups?This is not only normal for startups it is normal for every company everywhere. All you get is an offer letter with a list of bullet points the terms and the pay. There is no contract. Google and General Electric and WalMart will give you the same thing. Yes you will almost always get it before your first day but by no means do these documents grant you any legal rights. Indeed they are for the benefit of the company and not you. A company can immediately decide to retract the offer or even inform you that they are going to pay you a different amount than what is on the offer. If you dont like the change you can take your services elsewhere. gt He didnt have much to say to that...its like he had no idea.No its because you come across like a raving lunatic.

7633369,0,t3_4juw7x,Like DeadPolitician and mysteresc Id say dont bring it on your first day. Get a feel of the environment first. Normally its ok to bring something like a keyboard or mouse but its better to ask your manager or supervisor if its ok. There area also  things you should consider  The type of company youre working for. My point is your company may put a lot of value towards maintaining a corporate or professional look where Razer will be outofplace. Youre at risk of not being taken seriously and may inadvertently damage your career prospects. In this case you can get something else thats a bit more sublime like Ducky Legend Ducky Shine  or  Logitech G or G Brown. But for the corporate look nothing beats a Das Keyboard  Professional.  Is it noisy? If your Chroma is the Clicky version then I would strongly suggest that you leave it at home. Blue type switches like this sounds great to you but coworkers will find it annoying. I strongly urge you to consider getting another keyboard with a Brown switch. For me I do bring my own keyboard to work. I normally bring a Rapoo VPro  TKL with Brown switch and I also bring my Logitech G with RomerG switch from timetotime. Both are very quiet. There is an advantage to bringing a mech keyboard your boss will certainly know that youre working because he could hear you typing. On the down side your boss will also know when youre not doing anything. Something for you to think about.Last piece of advise despite what other people may tell you Red switches are not quiet. Theyre just as annoying as Blue type switches. ,cscareerquestions,d39vf0n,4,t5_2sdpm

7712095,0,t1_d3i9udf,Pretty good. The astronomy work is really interesting Quasars caught my eye. Few things   What was the purpose of creating the data visualization. Were you the first person to build visualization models of globular clusters to understand their evolution? Were you working with megabytes gigabytes terrabytes or petabytes of data? Did you use any newish or particularly interesting algorithms? Were the data visualization models built in a web frontend WebGL output as videos etc.   The subject matter sounds interesting but you should express a bit more about what you actually did and why it was important. e.g. Built the first webbased data visualization frontend for globular cluster simulations achieving fps rending of a  billion element point cloud. The ability to interact with the data in realtime lead to the discovery of blah or better understanding of blah or a paper in blah.   Assisted in generating code do you mean generating code in the sense of metaprogramming or I wrote some code? If you were working with a system that itself generated code then thats interesting and you should be a bit more specific.   Assisted in the analysis of the obtained and reduced spectra. What did you actually do? What did the analysis find? Were the findings important or interesting or new i.e. did they lead to a publication or is there a publication in progress   What is the Crookes Radiometer? how did you assist in the research exactly. What were the findings? Is it actually a better form of alternative energy. Did you help rule out its use as an alternative source of solar energy?   Not sure you should list all the subjects you did in coursework. Cut this out and add more color to your employment and projects.   Dont need the projects header under the technical experience. Maybe just replace Technical Experience with Side Projects   No Github or LinkedIn links? Put them under your email address. This would be a red flag for me.   Where What does Where actually do? Did you have people using it? Is it on the play store? How many installs  ratings do you have?   GeoBus Did you build the app from the ground up? If so stress this as its a real positive companies will respond really strongly to you showing evidence of building nontrivial things from scratch. What algorithm did you implement? Are people using it? Is it on the App Store?   Brain Map Sound really impressive. Id perhaps put this as the first project. A little rewording wouldnt hurt Built an interactive visualization of the human brain helping users understand the function of each distinct brain region. I populated the brain information database using Wikipedia data gathered with a custombuilt Scrapy? web scraper.   Be wary of saying proficient with programming languages. For example can you answer these questions about Python Hows the data structure underlying the Python list implemented? Hows the data structure underlying the Python dictionary implemented? Whats the key differences between Python  and ? When would you use a metaclass in Python? Whats the difference between a list and generator comprehension?

I suggest you keep this job do as much automation testing as possible I assure you companies will ask about this and work on improving your development skills on your own time.  If you want to be a developer you better show companies that you can actually develop something and follow best practices.  Just be aware that IT WILL BE TOUGH TO SWITCH. Well technically it depends on the demands of your local market and what technologies you are developing in I chose Java which seems difficult to make the switch to a dev role because you need to know JEE technologies e.g. StrutsSpring ORM Hibernate etc..

7744181,0,t3_4ldbwr,I would say go for the  years and get a BS.Most companies out there wont even consider you if you do not have a BS in an IT related field. Its harder for someone in your position with just a BA to get considered for employment not saying its not possible Ive seen many wo degrees get hired however theyre usually gifted developers.Not saying youre not gifted of course but to increase your chances of getting employment I think sticking it out for  more years will be worth it.One caveat would be if the boot camp guarantees placement after successfully completing the boot camp. In that case the costbenefit factor may be in your favor to go to the boot camp since boot camp is probably cheaper and will take less time however there arent many out there.Good luck!

7825814,0,t1_d3vokhq,I agree. But being able to program is different than having IT skills so it wont be that helpful if your aim is to fix basic issues. This is especially true in environments like Windows that tend to assume that the users are dumb and should not be allowed to tinker with their OS in comparison to any Linux distro.Also time is a limited resource. The number of things you advocate that everyone should learn is thus limited. Which means that you need to prioritise.

In my experience they were all fairly equal in difficulty.Also instead of sorting by difficulty sort by acceptance . Ive never trusted the difficulty. For instance the nd least accepted problem  is marked Easy. Now thats not to say that you shouldnt practice these harder ones but you SHOULD be able to answer the first  most accepted problems with ease before you interview with the big . Most of those will be listed as Easy and thats fine even though a few of those will give you trouble. Also really try to understand the solution. Work at it.

I can chat up a team but It scares me to reflect on my own code from years ago.

Your skills are totally different then mine and valuablethat doesnt mean I dont have my flaws as well.You might be more independent and introverted and deal with your own demons but as a hobby if you can have pride in reflecting in your own progress and work to me THAT is a big achievement.

Interesting work not micromanaged good people etc. When I signed on my offer letter not a contract included salary details of x initially then an increase at  months another at  year. Each increase was just over a COL increase but at  month increments. But now I am thinking about asking for more at my review.Due to my experience level at sign on I figured I would de in a junior type role.

The other I am the owner of several core modules. As such I am working nights and weekends to keep the projects on track as they are behind schedule due to outside dev being low quality. To be clear I dont mind these responsibilities. I dont like working outside hours so much but that should calm down. And I like being a decision maker.

8049809,0,t3_4pcqg4,Heres the thing if youre too aggressive in trying to deal with this then management might overreact by micromanaging everyone instead of just that coworker. From the perspective of anyone else on the team who isnt you or your coworker they might feel like theyre getting unfairly punished because of one person. It takes one bad apple to ruin a good thing for everyone right? Thats one of the reasons why people say mind your own business.If this keeps up he might increasingly close zero tickets or close to zero tickets per sprint. Then after some evidence has been accumulated hope that management will notice this black hole of productivity on their own. Until it directly affects you dont directly bring this issue up to managements attention.If management addresses him about this problem then I would keep an eye out for him improperly closing tickets to make it appear that hes working but without doing all of the appropriate work on those tickets... especially if your work depends on his work. If your work depends on his work then his lack of productivity becomes your business. On your end cover your ass and document. everything. you. do. Slackers will rarely have proof that theyre doing something. By the time they realize how fucked they are they will attempt to throw you under the bus and when that happens itll be good to have documented CYA evidence that its not your fault. Then emphasize that they dont have evidence to prove that theyre working especially the tickets that they havent closed.People say mind your own business but for team effort things eventually itll find a way to affect everyone. Like if theyre improperly closing tickets and deliberately injecting confusion into the process then eventually itll get to the point where possibly literally the entire team has to waste a few days and go through the queue and source code to unfuck the mess that has been made and subsequently covered up.But until it directly affects you mind your own business and cover your ass as a defensive measure.

8057782,0,t3_4ph6sc,I interned at a smaller Canadian office of one of the big  last summer. I felt a lot more relaxed than the main office in general and there were much fewer interns about  of us so we all really got to know each other well and hung out a lot. Even so I could  not imagine myself working there full time. It felt very corporate very politebutnotactuallyfriends what fun people there were were generally really awkward in the typical engineery way and no one seemed to really have hobbies outside of work. My boyfriend also once interned at Cisco which according to him was primarily middleaged east Asian men and generally awful although bitchin bagels.It depends heavily on the company and team though. Remember that youre interviewing the company just as much as theyre interviewing you. I was deciding between two major offers at the end of my senior year two companies of similar stature though one is ostensibly cooler than the other at the moment but that interview felt very businesslike  min technical and  behavioral interviews backtoback all dudes Im a girl and I notice when everyone I interact with at a company is male except the recruiter and no one seemed to have much of a personality. The interview process at the second company was much more relaxed they made an event of it and the people I talked to were super friendly and a great mix of young people and older cool dadtypes. I ended up going with the second one.Its easier to gauge culture when youre interviewing for fulltime positions because you generally interview with the specific team youll be working for rather than just a general SDE intern. I always like to ask interviewers about their side projects and what they like to do for fun.

I have found my local network to be invaluablemy network has grown through several sources. Particularly things such as my universityalumni group old coworkers that i actively keep up with interesting people I meet and keep up with development and nondevelopment network in the local dev community other devs entrepreneurs business people local companies my particular company and entrepreneurial groups. Thats what I would focus on. Its not about hearing about potential clients for you its about networking to figure out where your demand might fit locally. It might NOT  be in demand locally but its a good start.For example I got to know people at a Ruby meetup in my area despite i never really ever do freelance ruby work i just do it at my dayjob. Through that i met other people looking for ruby devs and i pointed them in the direction of my friends. I started teaching locally getting my name out as someone in the community that is helping educate. I go to local galas sponsored by other tech companies and meet the people getting out there and getting involved not devs i point people in their direction when they ask for recommendations I do not say i have worked with them mind you just that i know them and their contributions. Help others out keep positive relationships up and show value and it can help come backbut none of that helps if there is no demand.You might consider  networking with your old employees ones that you felt closer to. Catch up over coffee or beers. See what theyve been up to if there is something you can offer them then let them know youre freelancing now. Dont ask for work just let it be know. Then keep trucking on doing OS contributions looking on line for work etc. You shouldnt be asking for clients you should be building up your network and reputation and helping others. ,cscareerquestions,d4mzkj6,2,t5_2sdpm

8085834,0,t1_d4oobq0,Okay thanks Im mostly trying to verify that Im not just telling myself this is a good idea because I want to leave so badly. I agree with saving up more money before leaving but I just cant take it anymore. Several times a week Ill disappear for a half hour just because I cant deal with the bullshit anymore and need to talk myself down from quitting on the spot. Its been a year since my roommate left and he got an almost  pay boost because tech jobs in Illinoisoutside of Chicago at least pay so badly. I make about as much as he used to so I can expect something similar. I would literally have more spending money renting my own place down there than I do living here at my parents house.I think Im probably right in leaving my job as well. Every coder theyve had never stayed more than a year or so and over half of them left on bad terms. The problem with this place isnt so much demeaning our skills but utter incompetence from the owners and their belief that if they find the right employees they will be fine getting underpaid and putting up with tons of bs. For example until I set stuff up recently they had never used any online advertising or even online job boards. I have no idea how they were getting any decent employees or customers. Since I setup some online advertising stuff theyve made over a million in revenue from it in  mos. Thats a  increase for the entire company and I still get paid about k under market average.,cscareerquestions,d4ox6qg,1,t5_2sdpm

8174219,0,t1_d4zb2nl,Its just one of my favorite places and Ive gone on vacation there a few times. Its where I would move to in your situation. CO Springs Denver and Boulder are pretty much just in a line against the mountains. CO Springs is about an hour south of Denver and the area between the  that is fairly quiet and thats probably where I would look for a place in your situation. CO Springs also has Oracle and VMWare. IBM and Google have offices in Boulder. I said CO Springs because its a lower CoL than Denver or Boulder which are both currently growing rapidly. Since youre not worried about a job then lower CoL is better. But I honestly lump them all together since I dont live there.  SociallyPolitically speaking the climate changes the further north you go. Boulder is notoriously Liberal and full of old rich hippies. CO Springs is a military town. So overall for the entire area its a pretty good mix. But just to give you an idea I heard somewhere that CO Springs doesnt allow recreational marijuana shops. It only allows Medical Marijuana which is under different regulations and you need a prescription. Not that this matters but it kinda gives you an idea of the political climate. Also the homeless are a problem. Im not sure why. It is something that really throws me off when I go there. Theres a lot of them. The whole area is just so gorgeous and really promotes an active outdoor lifestyle that enjoys nature. Hiking Biking Backpacking SkiingSnowboarding Kayaking Canoeing Hunting Fishing etc. Stuff like that really helps your mental and physical wellbeing especially in a job that keeps you locked in the house working your brain so much. Its just so pretty everywhere you go because the mountains overlook the entire area. I wouldnt worry too much about the dating competition but its a big area and has lots of tourists year round. But if that is something that you are concerned about my suggestion is to get Tinder Premium and change your location to areas youre thinking about moving to to get a feeling for them. I wouldnt base where you move to off that but it can give you an idea before you choose. ,cscareerquestions,d4zbsal,2,t5_2sdpm

8179878,0,t3_4rbbox,gt Is it worth it for me to do a  year of school to get a diploma in CS and work my way in. Say do QC work and try to get programming work? I did some introduction to java courses in the past so Im not a total newbieSomeone else mentioned GATechs OMSCS  Ill second that. Inexpensive selfpaced and just as rigorous as the oncampus version.Some of the value though might depend on where you are now and where youre comfortable relocating to. Markets for programming IT etc are very different in different parts of the US and different parts of the world for that matter. Just browse along the board to see what experiences people are having with resumes interviews and the like.gt Someone told me to get into cyber security as there is a major demand and high starting salary.NB take with salt Ive heard it said that there is effectively a negative unemployment rate for skilled experienced infosec personnel and a glut of ITguysthatwannabe. My own experience interviewing and selecting people bears this out  were getting to the point that were having to scrape through contracting companies resume piles to find anyone and the people that are skilled are turning down competitive six figure offers. We still have open positions that its almost more trouble to fill than to just leave open. One of my vendors had a talented guy turn down a job as a WAF SEPS for k. He still cant fill the position.gt How hard is it to get into this? What do I need to do to be a specialist in cyber security?The infosec field itself has a ton of specializations. Firewalls IDAM IDSIPS virtualization access control WAF SIEM etc... and a large number of vendors Fortinet PaloAlto Checkpoint Cisco Juniper F and on and on each with their own products and specializations. You can select one and go pretty deep to improve your salary in that area or select several and generalize to improve your odds of finding a position. And of course the vendors themselves hire fairly regularly  though they tend to headhunt from their customers much to my chagrin.It really depends on what security technologies interest you. Getting into it for the money is probably not a good idea  security technologies and vendors change fast enough that its a constant learning curve. If you dont like it youll likely burn out quick. The projects were working on this year may look nothing like what next year brings. Sometimes I just need a talker  someone to stand in front of a large customer and who can answer questions and get requirements and who can understand not only whatever legacy environment they already have but what they need  which requires that person to know whats available what we currently offer and what we could offer given time.Unless Im looking for a specific technology I look for generalists for my security engineers  someone with experience with half a dozen vendors interest in several fields and a good background in CS or something like it. Maybe they have a few programming languages they probably know more than Windows and Linux. Certificates arent particularly important to me personally but I know some people seem to get off on them and some customers really want their contacts to have them.So to answer your question how hard is that? Its hard it takes time and theres no substitute for the time investment. What do I need to be an infosec specialist? Pick a couple of technologies and grab some online courses maybe study up on the topics of the CISSP and related certs or look at technologies involved in some job postings and start investigating there really like any other CS field.

8472502,0,t3_4vpfzs,your job sounds bad and I totally understand you looking for a new job.  ignoring all those shitty things you mentioned though I dont agree with people not attending company held events missing one sure but not ever going?.  these events are for team building its a time for you to interact with other engineers and management in a nonwork related environment.  where you can talk casually with them about what sucks and whats good interact with them about personal life and have some sort of bond with others that isnt strictly writing code.  this helps so that you have a better idea of how to work well together.  on top of that it allows the company to interact with all of its employees because each employee isnt in their own vacuum.  if a company tried to appease each employee individually it would be impossible.  instead a company needs to figure out a middle ground that all employees would enjoy and having social events helps management figure that out as well as gives engineers a reason to talk about things they enjoy so that the employees could even see commonalities.,cscareerquestions,d60lqvl,2,t5_2sdpm

Theres more and more coworking spaces popping up my fav being the Center for Social Innovation  Annex location. Its great. Low population....well not really. Toronto is bigger than Chicago now by population and the GTA is growing rapidly. But man the international food... You cant beat it! Low crime yup. Toronto is insanely safe. Low cost of living well not really. Toronto is expensive but manageable.  Startup scene is great. Lots of well known ones are either based from there or have a presence there.

8561649,0,t3_4wqqvx,Interestingly I work on the other end of the insurance system. Some companies very obviously try to obfuscate the appeal process by having several phone numbers and denying many claims regardless of medical necessity. Calling these companies the majority of people on the other end of the line seem to genuinely be helpful but the system is so obviously set up to waste as much time as possible. Calling customer support instead of instant messaging or having a working online system to followup on appeals. Mailingfaxing of documents instead of secure electronic transfer. And best of all theres no standardization each company does things their own way. As souldraining as it is working with these companies I can only imagine how much it must suck to work for them. They literally seem build in inefficiencies to slow the system down.As for your issue of hating every job it sounds like you could easily become financially independent within a relatively short amount of time with some research and followthrough.

Having knowledge is a small part of the equation.

I grew up here so thats weird to me but apparently the mph on  lane highways is intimidating to some people.That is because some people like me grew up in a more rural place where  lanes i.e.  each way is considered big. I remember driving in LA for the first time it was scary as F. I had never seen a  lane freeway before let alone the speeds.

8667409,0,t1_d6oz7x5,First both usually do three comparisons so your idea you are avoiding a check is false. And is a short circuiting operator so it only evaluates the second if needed.Even if it did evaluate both the comparisons are both small O is why the distinction is silly and problematic. The majority of the time spent for the fizz buzz test will likely be in the IO as thats normally much slower than simple computations. Code readability matters heavily and if you are going down the path of optimization you should be able to argue that the increase in efficiency is worth worse readability. You should also strongly avoid optimizing much beyond big O without actually timing the code. As an example    int data      for int i   i lt data.length i        ifdatai lt   is faster than if you had the data not sorted because of branch prediction technically youd also want data to be much bigger. This can mean given a large amount of data sorting it first before doing a conditional check might make it faster even if it comes at the cost of big O. That and if you are unfamiliar with things like branch prediction it becomes easy to incorrectly guess one program will be faster than another. Lastly trying to out guess the compiler with minor things like this tends not to help.,cscareerquestions,d6p1o2t,1,t5_2sdpm

Long versionIm an Indian working at a Big and Ill shamelessly admit that the Indians I work with are pushing me to the point that Ive caught myself being subconsciously racist AGAINST them. Sounds weird right? Lemme give more details. I was born and grew up in India and came to US for undergrad and grad. There are Indians here who have been hired from Indian companies and those whove been hired from college. The problem is most of these are people whore refusing to adjust to the culture here. For example one of the senior devs was hired from an Indian company with  years experience. He likes to simply walk into peoples office and stand behind them looking at their monitor before he even says hihello. It doesnt even matter to him if the door is closed a person is on a call or if anyone other than management is in the office. This bothers me and almost everyone else yes weve said this to him and he chooses to ignore it. On the other hand we have a brilliant Indian college hire. The person is supercourteous respects everyones time and knocks and ensures the person has the few minutes he needs to ask a question. Theyre both raised in the same environment but one is willing to adapt and the other is not. Thats it. Also there are devs here of Indian origin who were hired from college and worked hard. However the day they got their HB they started to stall. They just wanted the  till they get their green card dont care about growing or supporting the teams. Such people infuriate me because I dont care if someone doesnt want to grow but Im pissed when they dont deliver and bring the team growth down.

8794800,0,t3_50l1gj,While I think this is a good learning experience either way Im skeptical that tailoring your resume based on keywords is really going to help that much.Are you just applying to any software engineering job?  Why not decide what type of software engineering you want to do and then make yourself more competitive for that area.  That will both cut down on the number of jobs in your chosen field and will make it more likely that you will get responses from the jobs you do apply to.Also couldnt you just fill your resume up with invisible keywords so that people cant see them but the parser will catch them?There are certainly NLP algorithms which can successfully pick out keywords but they arent  so when someone looks at your resume theyre going to see reasonable stuff like Ruby on Rails Javascript or we and then right next to it could be something completely bizarre and nonsensical.Think of it this way your mass application job bot is fault tolerant if it applies to non relevant jobs  of the time no big deal youre not interested in those jobs anyways but if  of the keywords it uses dont make any sense then a lot of the resumes you send to jobs you do want will have gibberish words in them.I think a better way would be to separate the types of jobs you want into maybe like  classes and make a resume for each class.  Then have your job bot choose the class with the highest probability for each job and then have it send that resume that way at least you know all your resumes will make sense.,cscareerquestions,d750l12,9,t5_2sdpm

Exceptions are if the role is advertised as including working from home or something but these are rare and you would probably still be expected to show your face in the office regularly for meetings etc.Some employers may be willing to pay a relocation bonus or an arrangement where they pay for your first x months rent whilst you find a permanent place but you would need to negotiate that on interview or when they make you a job offer.,cscareerquestions,d79187r,2,t5_2sdpm

Perhaps something likegt When youre programming a framework most code you write is supposed to change the behavior of the individual components. So when a unit test catches a bug you often wont notice. Youll assume the test just needs to be updated with the new behavior.Again this is a skill you need to learn for more than just interviewing. As an experienced developer people will ask how they should test their code and you should be able to give a helpful answer.,cscareerquestions,d79yh72,3,t5_2sdpm

Look into the way that Ellen Pao was treated her employer allowed a colleague to destroy her reputation after she declined to continue a sexual relationship. If she were a white male with a Harvard MBA  that would never have happened. There are lots of discrimination lawsuits against Silicon Valley companies and Id guess that  to  percent of them are legitimate. There are also loads more of settlements that you never hear about. Ive been in enough companies and been involved in enough managementlevel discussions to know how people are sized up in this industry. Its pretty disgusting. Ive heard plenty of tech executives say that they dont want to hire anyone with more than  years of experience that they dont like to hire people with kids and that employees with sick parents are a drain on the company. Of course most white men dont benefit from that network or sort of privilege which is why I included the Harvard MBA qualifier. If you want to argue that socalled white male privilege is actually douchebag privilege that does nothing for white men from rural Pennsylvania or West Virginia Id agree fully with you on that. ,cscareerquestions,d7flo05,3,t5_2sdpm

8936352,0,t3_52nmod,I heard from a couple programmers early in my career that they loved doing code maintenance on a mature codebase for this reason  Your day is not dominated by bashing your head against a wall like when youre doing original work.  Typically you get a dozen or so relatively small relatively easy bugs that it takes you at most an hour to suss out and fix.  No deadline stress not a big deal if you miss dropping to prod because the product is mature and everyone is used to whatever bugs its exhibiting and wont be showing up at your cube with torches if you fix it a day later or whatever.  On that note the users who have suffered under the little irritating broken parts of the product will view you as a GOD when you take  min refactor a loop and find the off by one error thats been the bane of their existence.  Sometimes you do have more stress than others but worst case you just put the bug that youre not getting back in the pile while you work on other stuff.

Too much.The same cant be said about for example Binary Indexed Trees although I wouldnt study those as they are more of a DS that is used in competitive programming and not in the interviews or Disjoint Sets which can be asked as its much simplier to code and can really solve a lot of interview problems.

Low costofliving areas tend have far fewer and less competitive techjobs and be far less interesting to live.The savings might be nice for a month or two presuming they let you keep your current salary but then youll start to realize the reason the COL is so low is that the place is boring as fuck to live there are very few jobs locally etc.  When you decide to leave youre in the same boat as everyone else stuck in a midwest town praying someone in a techhub will consider hiring them versus someone who is already local or in another techhub.Im surprised OP is not putting up more resistance.  I mean Id expect a lot of people to have something tying them down to an area whether it be friends. family a house references industry connections or the reason they moved there in the first place.If I was told that Id be moving from Austin TX to nowhereville midwest town Id consider myself constructively fired not move and start applying other places immediately.

Under the FLSA unpaid internships are generally illegal and must meet a lot of requirements to be unpaid. Thats probably why theyre paying you minimum wage.I didnt know your situation originally but since you are a graduate have you been looking for work? Have you not had much success? In your case Id suggest sticking with your job for now developinglearning stuff on the side you should have plenty of time to do so if you only work  days a week and look for work on the side. It will be a lot easier to find another tech job when you already have one especially when youre new to the industry. If people ask you why you want to switch jobs so quickly you have plenty of reasons like This job just isnt what I expected and Im not doing the kind of work the job promised.If youre especially ambitious and you find your job to be very tedious and boring I would use that as an opportunity to learn and implement things for your job. Maybe there is a bettermore efficient way to do something at work that you can build software around. Maybe you should learn some new technologies and apply them to your job. This will allow you to claim cooler responsibilities on your resume while keeping you engaged at work even though youre only being paid minimum wage.,cscareerquestions,d84qcl2,1,t5_2sdpm

European events also available on that website Twitter and LinkedIn can be handy to have if you attend lots of meetups and conferences as its easier to give those out on a business card than to give someone a copy of your resume but personally I dont have a Twitter and have done fine. I would strongly suggest learning some frameworks like jQuery Angular.js and Node.js once you are more comfortable with JavaScript as these are but some of the foundations upon which webdevs use in their daily work. HTML and CSS are all good and well but they are markup languages and not seen as serious programming languages. Id recommend learning some PHP and MySQL as well.,cscareerquestions,d8l0gn2,5,t5_2sdpm

If you click the Not interested button and send out the generic quick response the recruiter would get their InMail credit back.

Cmon thats reaching no matter how bad my code is.EDIT Also interestingly most of the time when he tells me my code is unreadable and that he cant even understand what its doing he then proceeds to describe pretty much exactly what it does and suggests why that might not work as expected.

9265717,0,t1_d8qgw1v,gt Embedded software turns a device from a brick into something that actually does something. How does that not define it?It doesnt change what the hardware is.  By your definition all OS and systems development is embedded development.If I have an ISA or a set of ports or some other interface to program to than the hardware is defined.  Defining the hardware is creating the ISA and defining what those ports do when commanded.  I walked back on the HDL thing because there is an awful lot of C involved in that nowadays.  Much of the hardware I worked on had been designed in the mids when HDLs were pretty much the only way to implement hardware.  Firmware was what went into our programmable parts.  Embedded software is what went in to the ROM on our SBC.On my later for modern program firmware was the HDL and C code that went in to our custom programmable parts Nios II softcores plus gatelevel logic and embedded software is what went in to our off the shelf boxes running an RTOS.gt With your definition of firmware rather than the industrys I wouldnt argue with that. I dont know if Id go as far as to say I wouldnt hire a CS major to do VHDLVerilog work but I would certainly focus on the EECpE majors.To be fair I would not treat it as a hardandfast rule either.  I oversimplified into a sound byte and probably should not have.  As you said I would prioritize electrical and computer engineers over software engineers.Im not however only talking about HDLfocused positions.  I would be biased against CS majors for any sort of baremetal hardwarecontrol work.  Microcontroller code device drivers anything that needs to operate at a very low level.

9268015,0,t1_d8qa1xv,I think to say that its an arbitrary test is a copout. Sure algorithms in general are very academic in the industry mostly because most famous algorithms have been solved  optimized already but thats not really the point here. The point is you should understand and be able to demonstrate that you understand the basis of currently solved solutions. Most companiesteams reuse existing technologies thats the point here why reinvent the wheel? but if you dont have a clear understanding of whats actually happening under the covers at least theoretically well then thats like saying Im a professional house architect but I dont understand how plumbing works. Or I dont understand how the foundationmaterial of the house works. But Ill just trust that the plumbing guys from XYZ company and the materialfoundation dudes from ABC company to provide that to me but its okay I wont need to understand it. And when the house collapses well Ill just blame XYZ and ABC instead of diving in evaluating why it broke in the first place.Get it? Its a cop out. Demonstrate that you understand the principles of your craftsmanship. Thats the key. And yes it is also to weed out people who are just truly bad. Im not saying you should be the next Dennis Ritchie or be the next Dijkstra but at least demonstrate you know the foundational theory to the extent that a well educated software engineercomputer scientist should know. You only need to perform to a certain extent everything is relative.

Essentially you have to remember you can just turn down interviews no one forces you to go. Casting a wide net by not boring your recruiter will get you good companies and bad companies then just reject the onsite if during the phone interview you ask about technology and they start talking about Colbol whereas casting a narrow net with all technical and no impact will get you some stuff but the probability of getting a great company is low.Or to put it more succinctly making your resume more interesting in terms of value on top of tech will help your chances at good and bad companies but you shouldnt worry about the fact more bad companies will contact you.,cscareerquestions,d93bgw4,1,t5_2sdpm

9433626,0,t1_d9bn7q4,It doesnt its an oversimplification. The OP never explained why they wanted to work on side projects and develop new skills. If they think they have to to be employable thats patently false because they already are employed and if they think they need to because everyone else on the reddit seems to do side projects thats not a particularly good reason. As far doing interview prep with CTCI the OP does have some of their commute on public transit so I would recommend reading CTCI on the bustrain and trying out leetcode from their cell. An  hour work day and hour commute is soul destroying and you shouldnt come home and think I just got home from work I now need to cook dinner feed the dog and then work on this project before going to bed and sleeping only  hours because thats just going to make them more stressed out and all thats going to end up doing is make their quality of life go downhill and it will probably hurt their actual work performance to boot since theres only so much work you can do in a day before trying to do more actually adversely affects your performance to the point where had you worked less you wouldve been more productive. ,cscareerquestions,d9bs03v,1,t5_2sdpm

9508798,0,t1_d9kk2er,gt Dude I came here asking for advice not to be jerked around by some guy with a chip on his shoulder. I tried to be polite with you but you seem hell bent putting me in a box.You asked for brutal honesty about why you arent getting any interviews. I and several other people gave you some constructive criticism that your post and your resume came off as arrogant. Then you specifically asked me for more detail about that so I gave it to you. Now youre complaining about it and acting like Ive been bullying you the whole time.Im sure its not comfortable to read these things and Im sure I didnt phrase it in the best or most gentle way. To be clear Im not trying to shit on you or your school or your potential. Im trying to help you get interviews by giving you advice on how to spin your credentials into a story that potential employers will find compelling. I have many years of experience at companies that everyone on this sub thinks are the best of the best evaluating candidates doing interviews and making hiring decisions. If you dont want that kind of advice then Im not sure why youre posting here. gt Actually Ive got a ray tracer a scheme interpreter and soon Ill have an anomaly detection system for reddit comments.Think about this for a minute. How is a potential employer going to evaluate any of these things? Are they going to download your scheme interpreter compile it then write a scheme program and see if it works? No. This is just some random side project that they probably cant make heads or tails of. They might click on it and look at the code for thirty seconds to see if it exists and obviously sucks or is brilliant or has a lot of users or something. But thats probably not going to result in any actionable information so its just a random bullet point that theyre going to give very little weight. Having three or six or a dozen of these on your resume just means theyre going to spend even less time looking at any one of them.Having a degree and a transcript from a known school is infinitely more valuable to them. If you got an A in operating systems they know exactly what that means. Its a much stronger signal than a million side projects.gt The truth is that I like learning new things inside and outside of computer science. I do it in my spare time. This shows employers that I am willing to adapt.Thats great and you should definitely work that into the conversation. But theres a limit to how much milage you can get out of that and theres a point at which it becomes counterproductive. Youve crossed over that point. You need to back up and instead rework your resume to also emphasize some other qualities that employers value like interest and competence in the technologies that they actually use and general work skills like teamwork and grit and humility and communication skills and empathy and conscientiousness and focus.gt  If that sounds pompous to you go fuck yourself.I hope you can reread my advice and take it as it was meant as constructive criticism not as an insult.,cscareerquestions,d9l5tu6,1,t5_2sdpm

Applying Occams razor indicates that it is OPs ego that is causing the stress. We all have our shortcomings. Creating a healthy teamdynamic starts with earning the trust of your coworkers and being accepting of their shortcomings. This means making them look good in a wider context while advocating continuous improvement privately. Using the phrase office politics suggests a lack of understanding and unwillingness to suggest proposals to ameliorate the situation. That phrases is banded about as a catch all for so many issues that knowledge workers are often unwilling to engage. It is possible that an organization is beyond repair and there are not the correct incentives worthy of your continued involvement in which case you should seek new opportunities.

Ive never ever encountered an employer that has ALL of that.Yes some jobs are  hours. Im at one right now. I dont like it Im thinking of leaving. No big deal. There are lots out there that dont do that. Github is something I only ever hear about from college grads. As someone with  years it literally never comes up. Same with blogs never once had that conversation.LinkedIn is a convenience mostly. Its better to have the recruiters find you than you having to chase them down. That said if you have a few wellestablished contacts you can absolutely survive without LinkedIn. Facebook? Just... no. Ive never had it happen and Ive never met anyone who said they had that experience.Changing jobs is optional. I know some people esp. government contractors who are lifers and stay where they are until they retire. Its an option. That said you probably wont be getting pay bumps as quickly and youll probably fall behind on the technological learning side. But if you never leave its not really a problem I guess.The management stuff is  based on your personality. If youre the programmer type trust me it wont matter. But if they look at you and sense managerial skills yes theyll try to push you that direction mostly because management is sorely lacking in technically competent people. You dont have to though no one will force you to do that although some jobs may trick you into performing managerial roles but thats a different matter entirelyRegarding your goals yeah thats fine. Not everyone is an ambitious gogetter who wants to reach the height of achievement in this field. And as a recovering gogetter I say thats perfectly healthy. Ambition should be tempered by a dose of realism. Sounds like you know what you want so I see no problem here. Just dont get so complacent that you let your skills atrophy and lose value on the market. Cause then youll be stuck. Otherwise stop sweating the imaginary pressure  trust me we folks at the big  companies give envious looks at people who work simple unstressful jobs. Its a nice place to be.Plus maybe youll try that for a while and get bored. And if that happens maybe youll decide then to push yourself in another direction.

9709874,0,t1_da9woeu,It was a local private university I got an interdisciplinary MS with computer science and statistics coursework and a capstone that was in the data science field. Finding admissions statistics for graduate programs isnt really the same ballgame as it is for undergrad. Theres far less data to work with since graduate programs are small specific and unique in nature. Your GPA is one of multiple metrics that come into play. I had a pretty terrible GPA after my first two years of undergrad but ended up pulling it up to a . as I started to get into the academic groove. I would say you ideally want to get somewhere above . but if youre at a top school  is probably sufficient for many programs provided you have good qualifications otherwise undergrad researchTA experience helps if possible.The reason I mentioned my path was to let you know there are different ways of going about grad school. Having a great GPA is one path but individuals with great industry experience are also valuable applicants because of what they bring to the table. Its also worth mentioning that while many grad students are on teachingresearch stipends my company was paying for me to be there.

9725036,0,t3_5eatso,Well aside from execution there are a lot of things wrong with how you code. Im sorry if this sounds harsh but I want to provide some feedback. Some of these might sound like nitpicking but even small inefficiencies and rookie coding styles can make your interviewer more likely to reject you.Line   Youre not doing anything with the startindex and endindex aside from passing it directly into sumtozero...  which means there is no point in specifying those variables. Youre better off just doing sumtozeroarr  lenarr MediumhighLine   There is no reason for the if statement. Youve already checked this by line . Line  will always be True since line  blocks the False case from ever happening.MediumhighLine   You do a iteration over the array to detect the boundary between negatives and nonnegatives and set mid accordingly. At most there will only be one mid value if it exists therefore you should break out of the iteration as soon as you found it or find a more efficient way to solve the task. MediumLine   Why not just do if arraindex  arrbindex  ? Certainly more elegant and easier to read. MinorFinally your solution is incorrect  fails even though  and  are valid pair.

I see a lot of people in my major that honestly do not enjoy it and have no business being there.  I have honestly talked to CS majors that havent written a line of code outside of their own class work that also think they are going to earn k as devs right out of college. Rant aside the bootcamp I am looking at would take me farther West Boulder CO which probably wouldnt be a bad move for me regardless considering what you have just said.

9793682,0,t3_5fhcdp,I would say go to UW Madison. I attend UIUC but I think they have a decently solid program there.If you do attend community college youll probably have more time on your hands and you should probably get started learning more CS material and doing a bunch of side projects.I dont think networking with other students is that much of a big deal but career fairs and the brand name applying for internships would help significantly.I doubt that in your first two years that you wouldnt take any sort of CS related class.Since you can afford it you should really aim for the best education you can with the earning potential in CS I would attend Madison.Or at the very least only attend community college for one year so you can get started on the CS track and divvy it up as opposed to going really heavy on it the last two years and it would put you in a much better spot for internships your sophomore summer.,cscareerquestions,daka7rh,3,t5_2sdpm

Would they ask me how sql works or other languages I have listed? They arent going to ask me to implement a linkedlist or anything of that nature? Sorry just dont want to mess up my chance. Its my first time actually doing an technical interview for an internship. ,cscareerquestions,db00xok,1,t5_2sdpm

I notice area codes that are not local when I look at a resume. Its often harmless but I will admit as someone who gets first look at candidates that I note that and probably will ask about it. Particularly so if you dont have a physical address on your resume as suggested here. On the other hand if you say straight out that you are looking to relocate to this area and are excited about our company I note that too. Usually this is a good approach. FWIW in the last year Ive hired three people from out of state that have relocated here all have been clear that they were out of state but wanted towere willing to move to AZ for the job.

9939796,0,t3_5humzw,From my perspective the job market is good right now it feels like it was better a couple years ago circa  but it isnt bad by any stretch of the imagination.Like any industry there will be a distribution here. If you are in the top x of talent you can get into the big s without ever even opening CTCI or going on sites like leetcode. Then there is the bottom x who cant land seem to land a job no matter how hard they prepare. Most people fall somewhere in the middle and can get a job somewhere with varying degrees of effort. It may seem that a lot of people are out of work especially if you browse the internet because people tend to not waltz in and ask for advice or rant if they are not having difficulties.There are two sides to this. If a candidate has problems landing interviews then it is likely an issue in hisher application package or the way heshe is contacting the companies. If a candidate has problems landing offers but no problems landing interviews then heshe needs to polish hisher interview techniques.Now the other side some companies either expect too much from their candidate that its unrealistic e.g.  years of experience in a language thats been out for  or lowball their candidates so they never get anyone e.g. Oh you make k right now and have a k offer? Let me give you k we have a better culture than even Google so trust me that its worth it. So this is how some listings can go unfilled for a long time.I hope this helped a bit.,cscareerquestions,db36idt,2,t5_2sdpm

The only muscles doing the work in your body during running are the same ones targeted when squatting and deadlifting.The difference between top professional runners isnt muscle mass or body fat. Its the volume of blood pumped in circulation in a minute. Thats what running targets. Your blood circulation.Most people run hit their blood circulation limits slow down and then run at a comfortable pace that doesnt stress their blood circulation. Completely defeats the purpose of exercising through running. Unless your doing sprint training short continuous bursts of acceleration or marathon training increased average speed over longer distances and timesThats the equivalent of going to the gym only to use machines to workout your forearms and then wondering why you have trouble climbing steps.

Its a bitch and its probably a part of why you have a hard time making friends. Chances are no one hates you as much as you think they do. People with SA get bent out of shape about reference checks which to be honest are a little bit stressful for everyone because youre never . sure whom you can trust when theres much less to worry about than you might think. Unless you made enemies youre unlikely to get bad references. Ask your professors. If they arent inclined to say anything good about you theyll turn you down. If youre under time pressure you can list people before asking for permission but its best to avoid this if you can. Most of the time people will be happy to give good references and those who dislike you will just not return their calls. At an executive level that could burn you but if youre an intern and  out of  references doesnt return the call youd probably get the benefit of the doubt because sometimes people are just busy or unreachable. ,cscareerquestions,db890wd,2,t5_2sdpm

9985454,0,t1_db8z6z1,Solution I found which is essentially the same thing Round every number in the list to the nearest integer and sum to compute Z. Also compute T with the original numbers. C  absZT tells you the number of elements that need to be rounded the other way. Define the cost of switching an element as the distance from it to the nd nearest neighbor. Determine the C elements with the lowest cost and switch them.The key observation is that it never makes sense to change a number further than its nd closest neighbor.This is the greedy solution I arrived at it by just minimizing the cost function sum of differences and then making the most efficient how much closer to the target divided by cost mutations until all the constraints are met. You know its correct since each mutation is known to be the most efficient taking a mutation doesnt impact the efficiency of other possible mutations and its impossible to overshoot since you only get  closer each time so you only care about efficiency.,cscareerquestions,db94sfu,2,t5_2sdpm

We have several small to medium sized clients who call on us as necessary but not enough work to fill anyones time fully. Right now Im looking for someone technical whose travel and expenses I can pay for in exchange for promoting my company at conferences and such slinging around some nice metal and wooden business cards and talking about our high standards low rates and perfect client satisfaction record. This person would earn a commission as well as if theyre a developer some work for the clients they bring on. The few contractors Ive worked with have also been  remote and I would describe the culture as one that anticipates and cultivates excellence by genuine earnest passion and teaching but without any degree of micromanagement. I prefer to work with people I dont have to manage. Given that we work with mainly contractors who work as FTEs at other companies and who do parttime work with us whenever their schedule permits turnover is pretty low.

10202866,0,t1_dc0eeky,Thank you. I see a lot of people mentioning that going into coding without a degree is risky. They mention that with so many people trying to get into coding Specifically the easier routes like WebDev etc. eventually its going to saturate the market and create less of a demand for programmers Especially beginners like myself. Thats kind of why Im anxious to skip all the HTMLCSSetc. and go deep into something with a little more stability such as learning things youd learn with a CS degree as I guess that goes  LOT deeper into the fundamentals of programming and provides much better developed programmers. Ill still stick with what you just said in terms of just getting in but is there legitimate concern with the issues I stated above? Am I at a huge risk for lack of job security by going the WebDev route first As thats a lot easier for entry level and is easier to get entry level guys so many more guys in.Would it be better to Just get in through WebDev or again master the type that CS degrees would know and wait until I can truly master one thing and not be a jack of all trades and be expendable? Sorry if Im repeating questions I just want to make sure Im entering a stable enough market after leaving an admittedly good career in terms of finances. If I should truly just sit back read some books on the fundamentals of Computer Science THEN worry about C and Python etc. or if I really should just do webdev hope I dont get let go due to a saturated market and THEN work my way to the Computer Science stuff. If I can get into a Fulltime job starting out in webdev Id feel a lot more comfortable but from what Im seeing the only realistic chance I have to get in based off my limited skillsetknowledge is tempcontract which of course terrifies me financially and really isnt an option right now.,cscareerquestions,dc0jvoh,1,t5_2sdpm

Its possible the freshmen who enter MIT might be more experienced programmers than those who enter VT but all of them will have their asses kicked by fundamental weed out topics like pointers and theory. Lots of freshmen enter their programs thinking theyre hot shit. Few continue to believe that into their sophomore year and beyond. Companies know that undergrads have much to learn regardless of the relative prestige of their schools.The advantage you get is in what organizations come to recruit in person.

10229606,0,t3_5mh7mk,You might value your coworkersboss but if someone came along offering to do your work for half your current salary they would more than likely throw you under the bus. Loyalty means nothing these days and every employee has a jobhopping price...especially when it is SIGNIFICANTLY more money.This is something to seriously consider. It will set you up in the future for an even bigger paycheck down the road. If someone offered me a  raise Id jump in a heartbeat unless my current company was prepared to do something closematch it there are other threads about how you should go about that but I wont discuss that here. It would take you what another year or  of working your current job then changing jobs again to maybe come close to this salary increase? Youre saving years on your career in that case.The fact the job is in a field you enjoy more is a big plus too.Whats the new commute time? With a  minute commute you should consider yourself VERY lucky at the minute. I recently moved from a  minute commute to a  minute commute and its not really a problem. Ive heard people that commute hours each way in the states  as long as its not more than  minutes is acceptable in my book.Also you dont have to put anything on your CV you dont want to. If you land this job and work there for  years then leave the  month job off and just say you took a sabbatical. You also dont have to quit your current job before going for the interview...If you can get this job I would say take it. It sounds like a massive boon to your career,cscareerquestions,dc3kzyg,2,t5_2sdpm

Im open to the idea that language and culture color perceptions just find it annoying that this is usually brought up and heavily exaggerated to discredit valid science. Your cultures god of lightning is not equivalent with my cultures Maxwells equations.Recognizing patterns is so basic universal and fundamentally bound up with intelligence that any culture capable of significantly inhibiting this basic instinct has some serious fucking issues. Like you suggested I think a lot of the big crossculture differences are differences in exposure and practicing problem solving rather than genetic though that plays a role too. ,cscareerquestions,dc3qth8,1,t5_2sdpm

10349692,0,t3_5o5htk,As youve probably seen from the rest of the answers in this thread general consensus is pretty split.  Heres what I personally have experiencedI came from a similar financial situation as you.  I did four years at an expensive out of state school and graduated with k in student loan debt.  The flip side being I did an internship at a Big company that ended in a job offer which I took.  Due to the pay level and generous stock signing bonus I paid off those loans in . years while maintaining a decent quality of life in the process.I will fully admit the only reason I had any chance of landing my job was because of where I went to school.  The program was quite reputable and had noteworthy companies scooping up students quite frequently.  The flip side being that usually schools that are very well known are also very hard.  I knew many people that got a semester of three of debt and then dropped out.Now the flip side of this.  I have friends and coworkers that went to schools with lackluster CS programs but still landed jobs at very good or very well known companies.  The way you do this is making your resume standout with side projects and hobbies because you recognize the degree wont be interesting enough for most recruiters.  I have seen a TON of freshgraduating resumes where the applicants just list the same set of classes they took in school with no noteworthy skills projects or experience.So I have some suggested routes for you.  Aim super high and know what you are getting into.  Find a school whose program interests you and is either wellknown or successful.  Look at the graduation rates and look at the employment rates.  Also look at the costs of living and tuition rates and then do some napkin math about what your ultimate debt would be and the likely monthly payments.  Then look at entrylevel jobs on salary websites such as GlassDoor and the cost of living in those areas and see what kind of quality of life youd have on that given the loan payments you calculated.   Youll also need these numbers to convince your folks to cosign loans for you because remember if you bail they might be stuck with the bill. I only suggest this route because despite the absurdly high costs of tuition at some schools software engineers are some of the few professions that can repay those insane loans in a reasonable time even on a salary right out of school.  Now only consider this route if you are picking a high quality program with a great track record and hiring rate anything less and you then start having questions about bangforyourbuck.. Go to the school thats free fly through the program absolutely nail it and take out the absolute minimal set of loans that allows you to not have to work.  Focus  on school and side projects that you feel would be impressive to companies you ultimately want to work for.  Aim big but reasonable for side projects.  They want to see something you spent months if not a year or two on since thats what you tend to learn a lot from... living with decisionsmistakes you made for a long time planning a big project and executing time management and estimates etc.  .  Start with route  for a year or two to solidify this is indeed your passion get used to being off on your own and going to college a nontrivial thing that is typically the main reason most students flunk out and then transfer to a different school and do route  .  It may end up taking you a total of  or so years to graduate but transfer credits are way cheaper than regular credits so youd likely graduate with less debt that others that did  years in the program.Lastly like others have said once you get  years experience no one cares where you went to school.  If you have any more questions feel free to PM me especially if you have more specific or personal questions.,cscareerquestions,dch74f9,3,t5_2sdpm

10412842,0,t3_5p0s4l,I was just going to make a post that kind of overlaps with yours. Im a rd year uni student so my perspective is probably limited but here it is anywayI feel like there are three areas of fundamentals that we as developers have to balance in order to be competent.The first area is CS fundamentals. This refers to basically being able to use data structure and algorithms effectively and is almost completely language agnostic. This is what we learn in school.The second area is programming fundamentals. I think of this as how good is your knowledge of the ltstdlib.hgt of your language?. Do you understand whats happening under the hood? How quickly can you pick up languages and use apply it? Can you debug this program? It also requires being confident enough to translate your first area fundamentals into code. This is the CTCI part of technical part of job interviews.The third area is developer fundamentals. This refers to the real world application of programming which unfortunately doesnt have much overlap with area one and two. What languages do you know? Do you know newlibrary.js or suchandsuch framework? Whats the difference between FTP and SFTP? ,cscareerquestions,dcod3ce,2,t5_2sdpm

This your opportunity to make mistakes so you can learn.At the same time I completely feel you. Youll not be able to deal with the seriously large and complex systems and projects larger companies will deal with so opportunities for technical growth are more limited.In terms of career you have some options here. A startup tech guy that paid close attention to things will have a great grasp of the business side of things which is something thats much harder to get working for BigTech. If you play your cards well and you like managing people you could certainly move to highlevel managerial or executive positions in small companies over your next  years. From there on youll be a manager so manager options will be open for you maybe become a manager at a BigTech company starting your own thing do an MBA and switch to an entirely different sector... Youll have a technicalanalytical background which counts as a plus for many managerial positions.If you want to stay on the technical ladder then my personal view is that in your situation youll probably have to make a movement. If you want to tackle truly large and impactful projects youll usually not be able to escape from being somewhat specialized.

Outside of some sort of company specific agenda or even interview panelperson agenda its hard to create an argument for why the company would be purposely hire a lesser candidate simply due to her being female. You want the best candidate who you feel will create value for the company. So there really isnt anything to strive for. The process is kind of self governing on a grand scale.My guess is OP is lyingshitposting the company itself has bad practices that are far from indicative of the norm or through sheer coincidence he was interviewed by a more technical person meanwhile the other candidate was hired via a more personalable person.Its entirely possible that this is just a case of Hanlons Razor,cscareerquestions,dd91g9g,34,t5_2sdpm

When I tell her to do some research experiment with the software damn I even tell here where to look for info she does it for no more than  minutes keep complaining and runs to somebody else for help or she just drops the task starts doing something else and tries to get me to help her later on...Whatever she does she keeps both working and checking facebookwhatsappskypetwitter. Its like no matter what the workload is messing around with social network is taken for granted everything else is just secondary...The feeling Ive been getting since she started acting like this is that she doesnt want responsibility for her actions but also wants to be treated as a fully qualified member of the team.

Perhaps were building a mobileweb app to manage your bank accounts move money pay bills and so forth. But that app is deployed on AWS and weve scripted it to spin up entire environments in minutes and deploy changes without outages even if we find a bug and have to roll back. Were redesigning the app so individual components can be tested and deployed individually and thats actually a really challenging problem. Ask me and I can opine for a long time on how its challenging.Secondly the place I work may be stereotypically boring thats what they say about banks isnt it? but its not just any bank. We try to be a company that makes a positive difference in the world. Change banking for good is a slogan but they mean both sides of the pun. Offering a checking account with no hidden fees and no minimum balances that actually pays interest doesnt sound like much but it can actually make a difference for people. Offering a free way to send money to people I cool  cheaper than Bitcoin. Giving people a reminder to pay their credit card bill or a grace period may cut down on our fee income but it sure helps the customer.I guess what Im saying is that I find my meaning for myself.

If you are willing to take a pay cut for a couple years and be kind of bored at your job apply to jobs at finance insurance or old tech think IBM or Oracle companies. These companies are not as rigorous with their interview process and test more for soft skills. The job will be easier so you can use the extra time to read books and do side projects. From there after a few years you can apply for big  or a more prestigious job given some real industry experience and show off youve learned from the side projects...Tldr you definitely can find a job maybe just not that  figure salary at Big ...work at finance insurance or old tech companies to get some experience and brush up on your algorithms and stuff on the side by reading a lot or doing side projects.

Most of what Im about to say is primarily applicable to the Bay Area and is very different in other regions.Yes recruiters dont work very well when theyre separate from the dev team.  They end up getting you a bunch of crappy resumes and wasting your time.  What I have found works really well is hiring a marketing person and treating tech recruiting as a marketing exercise.  This person literally ran a marketing style funnel for me with a budget for events social search ads retargeting and so on.  Every week we would talk about the funnel and how we can get more people through the right stages.  The dev team was involved in every stage of the funnel by the way helping run meetups doing referrals speaking at events and so on.We ended up with a very nice stream of candidates many more than a company our size would normally have and the engineers felt very involved in the process which helped morale.  The candidates we ended up with were qualified and rarely ended up being a culture issue.With all that success I still for the life of me cannot convince other folks that this is a better way.

They could have just been conservative with their estimates or your company is just cheap and they always pay below market rate and lie and say they are competitive or whatever. Or your company like mine makes up their own strange titles therefore making it hard to compare to jobs at other companies with same responsibilities but different titles. This can mess up the sample size for the market research as well. Now you can do your research and determine your company is not being competitive with its pay.

Instead I just focused on playing the recruitment game optimally to maximize  of high quality offers. This is not easy to do unless you consistently do the right things at the right time. So in that sense I was lucky that I started early. My advice is to stop competing with the ACM medalists of the world and instead focus on networking getting great degrees studying the interviewing process selling yourself well via your resume  personal website  LinkedIn and being professional. Plenty of people in this industry have mountains of talent but sell themselves poorly andor have little to no professionalism. You can beat these people  of the time simply by having wellwritten resume  networking emails a strong work ethic an open mind and a willingness to learn. ,cscareerquestions,de8x1dr,7,t5_2sdpm

10960940,0,t3_5whc0h,I moved to a college town in upstate NY from a Midwest city having grown up in NYCNJ.Let me preface this I highly do not recommend this unless you are a country person at heart. Company paid for my move drove a UHaul and hired movers to load and unload only. At the time it seemed to be a step in the right direction career wise figured Id under not having as much as a social life for a year would pay off for the future. It did not I had A LOT of trouble finding a place everywhere I booked previously did not look as safe as it seemed in photos lots of places were run down and I didnt really start doing any sort of work until March and I had moved in December. Needless to say I felt very sad and alone for the longest of times even though I moved with  coworkersfriends of mine together and they kept me sane.So that sucked but let me say this moving from NJ to the Midwest was the best decision of my life. I absolutely loved where I moved to made a group of friends almost instantaneously explored the city hit the bars work was great I dont know why the hell I ever thought to leave there. Now Im back in NYC looking for a job and trying my best to forget about what happened in the last year and keep my head held high its not easy.  ,cscareerquestions,deajknv,2,t5_2sdpm

11108946,0,t3_5yjz5b,Ive never really experienced losing a teammate but Ive been the replacement twice.  In both cases the previous persons had died suddenly so there was no transition time at all.  I can tell you that things do go on without critical team members.  It does take time to absorb critical knowledge and most everything will take a little or a lot longer to do without the key person.  But the real pain only lasts a few weeks to a few months.  Usually other people come together to share the responsibility and everyones knowledge and skills grow out of necessity.  Things to watch out for.  For a critical person the knowledge and responsibility will probably have to be shared among several team members.  Ideally several people will pick up parts of the job with overlapping knowledge.  Problems occur is one person is expected to pick up everything or if no one wants to pick up the unpleasant rolls the person had.  Especially critical if the person was in charge of builds or test environments. Continuing to use the persons departure as an excuse for almost every problem or missed deadline.  It will definitely have an impact for  months but after that a new normal should be established.  It might be different than before sometimes better sometimes worse but by then the team should have moved on.  Ive seen teams that use well if we still had Bob we could have it done in  months but now it will take  or   for far too long.tldr  Yeah it sucks but things will go on and if the team works together it will probably suck less than you think,cscareerquestions,der6tsv,2,t5_2sdpm

Side projects outside of class are really helpful for your personal growth help you pass the HR screen check off more boxes and serve as a talking point at career fairs  nontechnical interviews. If you spend the summer spending hrsweek on learning by doing side projects and doing leetcode as a full time job you should be fine getting an internship for the next semester.I think the best case would be coming up with a few competent side projects and expanding on them.

11190377,0,t3_5zrfsf,Most master programs have closed registration in Canada already. You should have been deciding your options early January late December. So if you will be doing a masters program youll have to wait a whole year for that. At this point your best bet is to get a job or an internship until next winter.For getting a masters theres usually only  reasons pursuing one either You have a shit GPA and couldnt find a job You enjoy academia There is a niche position like ML that you are targetting.The only pros I honestly see are the last two points academia or a niche job that requires higher level education.Pros are better salary but opportunity cost usually makes getting a masters not worth it. You can work  years even at k so total k after  years. With a masters in Canada you could start at k youd already be behind  years salary and after  years if you put some work into it raises from a new grad position could easily eclipse a starting masters salary.Ive talked to many of the profs in my program and they almost always suggest getting a job first and then go back to school for a masters if thats where your passion lies. Most talks most people get money rolling and realize money is more important than getting their masters. Additionally getting a masters will always be there for you and a company may eventually pay for your education.,cscareerquestions,df0ezlf,1,t5_2sdpm

And I wouldnt put money against that either.As far as backstabbing remember that this is an industry where functionally immature people are often dealing with   or even  or figure sums of money.Twitter is a great example of just how awful such young people can be on their own or particularly when manipulated by greedy investors and boardmembers and every backstabbing moment in Silicon Valley is a Friends episode compared to them.And theyre SUCCESSFUL.

I read a lot and I can tell you there are some excellent life changing books out there no matter what you are studying computers history diet etc.Unfortunately when it comes to jobs there are just a bunch of ok books but together are worth it. Getting a good job is so important though I guess you just have to tolerate it.A good example of this is the book What Color Is Your Parachute?. That book is like a . Maybe . But it did have two EXTREMELY important insights I took away from it even though I remember skipping like  pages of it at one point this was the chapter where you had to create your flower life diagram to find out your true purpose . The insights were that in an interview if an employer asks you the same question again slightly rephrased PAY ATTENTION because that means you messed up and didnt really give the answer he or she wanted the first time. The other was that if the interviewer starts to shift his tenses and says things like If you were  months into this job and... or Will you be able to work with customers who... thats a subtle sign that things are going well and its unconscious on the part of the interviewer.The books altogether were Peggy Mckee she is the best I found her last but really you can just read her and nothing else Resume Magic Great book also Knock Em Dead  Two Hour Job Search   Minutes to a Better Interview Interviewing Jack GrayIn the end I would say knowing how to get a job is such an important skill I would say its my most important skill after programming there is no reason you shouldnt study it for a year so that even if youre laid off tomorrow youre instantly ready to go. Also if you are doing a video interview get a webcam like the Logitech C mount it on a mini tripod and then place the laptop behind you. This way you can look at the lenses which you can position at eye level and then mostly see your interviewers face behind the tripod.

Not that I would normally have noticed but Word underlined it in red so it was pretty glaring.A few other initial impressions  keep in mind Im just a random CS student not a recruiter so make of it what you will The fact that the dates arent aligned is very noticeable and quite jarring. Maybe this isnt an issue in your finalized version but if it is definitely fix it. As others have pointed out the formatting is pretty bland. While resumes shouldnt be colorful and flashy either aesthetics do matter and some small tweaks can go a long way in that regard. I would suggest looking up some CS resume templates online and building off of that. The concepts section was pretty strange to me since most of it seems to be things that any CS graduate should be expected to know. You also list artificial intelligence there but nothing else in skills or work experience to back that up so it just seems like filler. I would probably remove this section. The descriptions under the experiences can be improved. As someone who knows nothing about ABAP all I got out of it was that you created modified and debugged stuff. If possible try to work in some impacts. For instance what benefits did the work produce? How many people did it impact? How much time was saved each week? Etc. Same goes for the educational game development. If you can talk about how many students ended up playing the games or even just some more details about the gameplay I think it would be a lot more interesting. As it stands I have no idea how complex these games are and how long they took to make.As a whole I think this resume could really benefit from some projects. There is a lot of whitespace and quite a few languages listed there that arent backed by anything under experiences. Make some projects using those languages put them on github and make a new section in your resume to describe them.If you havent done so yet be sure to post in the resume review thread to get more opinions.,cscareerquestions,dfbzo8y,2,t5_2sdpm

11302471,0,t1_dfd3f4w,gtNo I explicitly said there are less applicantsHere are your literal words.gtThere are less jobs in that specialty than most any other area. By all means a person should do what interests them but to turn a blind eye to the fact that there are far fewer openings in embedded is perhaps illadvisedThats not applicants thats jobs.gtOh you mean like CE or EE grads? Or ME grads who know something about what the embedded shit is connected to?Yes. Who werent trained to write software. Notice I said embedded software jobs are being filled by nonCS grads. A vast majority of nonCS engineers take a single programming class in Fortran COBOL Java etc. The reason they then end up writing software for embedded systems often not involving any of those languages is because there arent enough applicants from CS grads to fill them.gtsignificantly more than averageAverage to what? To web developers? Because Ill tell you thats completely wrong based on any research you do. And the problem with your statement doesnt have to do with the word well. You say some of them are paid well. Thats wrong.gtThere are way more companies that wantneed general software engineers such as web developers than there are companies that need embedded software engineers.Then you should have said that. But its not what you said. You said very few companies which is completely wrong. Based on your new clarification though sure there are. But its not as though there are  U.S. companies hiring embedded engineers. You can compare web and software development and embedded development all day long but they arent the same. Web and software development are much wider in terms of jobs available but they are also extremely saturated. Just looking at the front page of this sub for proof of that. To put it another way lets say we have two rooms. Room A is three times as big as Room B. But if I put  people into Room A and  into Room B then Room B is going to seem much more spacious than Room A.gtIm tired of arguing about this with you. All I wanted to say in this whole fucking thread is that there are drawbacks to going into a specialized field such as embedded software development that accounts for a small fraction of open positions.Thats fine. But when you start spewing info thats just wrong and uninformed then youre typically going to notice people want to set that straight.

By resolution I mean the inability to tell meaningful differences between two very similar options. Lets theres indeed a strict quantifiable rank ordering in qualifications and skills among candidates Candidate A is  qualified for the job Candidate B is  and Candidate C is . However youre only able to tell candidates apart if theyre at least  points away from one another. As far as youre concerned B and C are identical. What happens next? The natural thing for people to do is to unintentionally introduce meaningless extra factors that are easily distinguishable Was B more assertive than C? Was C what you expected a hire to look like? Did B make you laugh? Did C graduate from the same school you did? Often we just go with the safe option that meets our preconceptions.When you imply that its necessary to lower the bar for women youre saying that women are more often candidate A in this scenario and less so candidate B or C where there is a real problem with bias tipping the scales.,cscareerquestions,dfhth46,10,t5_2sdpm

11521891,0,t3_64eefk,IMO learning C and JavaScript would be best for Oogle. I personally think C would be more broadly applicable if your only goal is to get in the door and you dont care what you work on but JavaScript is good too if you prefer to do frontend work.Im guessing JavaScript PHP and React would be good for another company that rhymes with Acebook. One thing you should keep in mind is once you work at one Big  or another wellknown company it becomes much easier to get into another one so even if your end goal is one specific company you should keep other companies in mind. My suggestion is to look at their jobs pages and see what kind of skills and languages they list.Also keep in mind that the scope of what you work on is equally important as the tech stack. If youre designing and building a complex standalone project or feature thats going to come across as more impressive than for example spending the summer doing small bug fixes for a legacy app. For this reason Id shy away from shell scripting as a primary focus. Its useful to know as an engineer but shell scripting alone isnt as impressive on a resume as working on larger projects because shell scripts tend to be more for focused oneoff tasks.,cscareerquestions,dg20ayi,1,t5_2sdpm

Some notables Defense of the Dark Arts  usually offered every semester due to popularity. next semester taught by aaron bloomfield who is a phenomenal lecturer. Network Security  a special topics class which isnt offered every semester. You can even view the syllabus for this class already. Computer Networks  a bit more broad but will heighten your understanding of networks. Topics in Wireless Networking  a grad level course but its generally pretty easy to get into these if you talk to the professor. Cyber Physical Systems  i have no clue what this is but it might be related to what youre interested in. Ecommerce technologies  I took this class and some cryptography techniques are covered. Basically I think if its down to UWMadison and UVA you should choose UVA. I say this because I believe the marginal benefit of you choosing UWMadison just for their CS program is not great enough to outweigh all the other reasons to go to UVA.  Your parents want you to go to UVA the job placement at UVA is amazing for its ranking if youre instate its super cheap great atmosphere nightlife and location extremely smart people etc. If you were deciding between say BerkeleyCMUMITsome ivies excluding Cornell or UVA  Id say definitely go for the former.

It is usually broken up into supervised vs unsupervised learning. In supervised learning you have labeled data and you want to learn a model that associates examples with a label. Unsupervised learning has unlabeled data and tries to find patterns in the data.Most machine learning algorithms are mainly statistics. Linear regressionlogistic regressionexpectation maximization are all techniques that can be viewed from a statistical lens as trying to create a model that has the highest probability of describing your data. There are machine learning algorithms that are not normally viewed as a statistical model with examples being knearest neighbors support vector machines and neural nets. Technically there is a statistical interpretation of support vector machines but it is more easily understood as a geometric method. All of those examples where supervised machine learning.

11635858,0,t1_dgewxws,It is NOT a troll post. I have Complex PTSD and some type of attachment disorder from twenty years of abuse neglect and torture. And everyone here is having fun at my expense playing kick the sufferer.gt Just by reading a few of your comments in this thread I get the vibe that youre the type to divert blame to pretty much anything but yourself.I spent the first half of my life blaming ONLY myself. I had to go to a therapist to stop that habit. I have spent a considerable amount of time and effort improving myself but I have reached a point where I cannot achieve greater by myself. I need help but everyone I ask sees blood in the water  easy prey for their darkest desires. I have spent my life developing in isolation  no help from anyone especially not my parents. By all rights I should not be alive yet I receive constant criticism from people who cannot comprehend the challenges I face to the point where they insist they dont exist. They demand perfection despite never delivering anything close to perfection themselves  I live in a world of hostile hypocrites.gt Not trying to be harsh but a lot of people have been through shit and while Im not trying to marginalize your past struggles it seems like your attributing way too much of your faults them and that would come off as a red flag to most people.Sigh. Like I said I have spent a lot of time improving myself. I have surpassed many people in my field in many skills the only one I have problem with is that skill that requires other people  social skills. But the Catch is that you NEED nearperfect social skills in order to be accepted by anyone anyone with lessthanperfect social skills ends up pariahs  most are homeless or dead. I am willing to do the work but I NEED people to meet me half way  except people in my experience would rather kill themselves than risk being associated with me the social cost of being seen with a outcast is being outcast yourself. Its like a caste system if lower castes were contagious.What is particularly frustrating is the type of person who demands the most perfect social skills are the people who took my ability to have social skills away in the first place  they demand what they know I dont have because they cut it out with their own hands.You would not be able to tell who I was in person  I am a completely different personality in real life. I cant use that personality here because I would not be able to post at all using that personality  I am almost completely silent in real life.gt My hunch is that that side of you was noticeable throughout your interviews and was a bigger factor to you not getting hired than the interviewers being narcissistic.I did not literally mean narcissism here. It was supposed to be a turn of phrase but now I realize the inclusion of advanced attachment disorder ambiguates things. Attachment Disorder Is serious I should not have included a nonserious narcissism in the title.gt P.S Its not the world versus you.My experience is that everyone I have met is against me with exactly zero people on my side. I have no reason NOT to extrapolate that trend to the entire planet not after collecting decades of evidence.,cscareerquestions,dgexr6l,1,t5_2sdpm

11683008,0,t1_dgk3wg9,What youre looking for  bump is modest. The reason youre asking is probably worth unpacking a little bit before you ask. Has it been a while since you received a raise? Were there any implied expectations that people at the company had about what would happen in the event of an acquisition? Have you been performing well to your knowledge? Was your work in fact instrumental in helping the company look like an attractive acquisition target and if you dont make the transition would the acquiring company raise some eyebrows? I think you could almost just ask using the same wording you used in this post I was really hoping...  but would just suggest steering clear of any implication that you would like to be paid more simply because a bigger company with deeper pockets is paying. If you believe youre being paid below market rates thats a fair thing to ask regardless. ,cscareerquestions,dgkaawj,1,t5_2sdpm

11697262,0,t3_66ww1n,It depends on what the course is about.

Sending a CV to a job posting can be a very ineffective way to find a job. You are throwing a piece of paper onto a pile of dozens or hundreds of other pieces of paper.There are  books that talk about why throwing your resumes into a black hole doesnt work very well.  is What Color Is Your Parachute? and the other is Designing Your Life by Bill Burnett. Chapter  and  specifically talk about how the standard resume technique may only be about  effective and then they show a better way. Basically how to effectively find the hidden job market. quotes that illustrate the problem In fact in the U.S. only  of all the available jobs are posted on the Internet  or posted anywhere for that matter. and The problem is that  of employers have admitted that they respond to fewer than half of the candidates that apply.Id highly recommend reading Designing Your Life.

Java and Python are generally easier to learn and so they are used more often in intro classes because they remove some of the things that might bog the class down memory management etc. But I think you would almost have to use CC in a networking systems or OS course to really understand and have control over what is going on. In general C is popular because its a fairly generalist language especially with C and upward adding a lot of qualityoflife things to the language. Most companies tend to use it because its a fast compiled language which is why its commonly used in scientific applications and gaming. You have for better or worse much more control over what the system is doing. Therefore you can get a lot more out of your system if you need to using such a language. ,cscareerquestions,dgtkj9l,25,t5_2sdpm
