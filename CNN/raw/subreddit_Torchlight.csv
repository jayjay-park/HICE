695903,0,t1_cgixpzt,for your vanilla problem you could console dungeon town it would advance the story correctly to my knowledge.btw mine is quite stable running synergies mcmm memm and a few other mods Ive consolidated into a single .mod with a few tweaks of my own.  make sure your load order is correct bottom of the list is first to load being successively overwritten by mods further up the list where conflicts occur.,Torchlight,cgjdjyx,2,t5_2rb10

754116,0,t3_22sps8,you have to be killing things whos level roughly matches that of the items youre after which sounds obvious.  I edited this post to say that you can also gamble within I think  levels of the thing you want and get it too.  Ive got a  Outlander that Ive gotten the belt on when I was gambling.The other thing that Ive noticed and maybe Im crazy is that the loot I get even if the characters are the same level seems to be different depending on what class Im playing so maybe try another class too?Otherwise you can always trade for stuff.  I think I have ring and the belt if that helps.,Torchlight,cgpzzxq,2,t5_2rb10

1138940,0,t3_275ln1,I think while your calculations are correct your premise is not. The reason I say this is because theoretically if youre killing an infinite number of mobs with an infinite amount of health then yes you would do the most amount of DPS the way you have outlined. However this is not the case because mobs have a finite amount of health. There is a limit to how long dot can last before the damage is going to kill said mob anyway.Basically if your dots are ticking off before a mob dies then yes the best source of increasing your DPS is likely to come from increased durationincreasing the number of dots on a mob. However if your spells are already killing a mob within the duration of the dot then your best avenue of increasing damage is either going to be ranking up the skill or ranking up brands. ,Torchlight,chxqpk8,3,t5_2rb10

1269389,0,t3_28m7fi,In TL any character you make can seamlessly change from singleplayer LAN or online multiplayer. When you load the character you choose which of the three you want to do and at what difficulty. In the case of LAN or online youll then have to either create a game or join an existing one and youre given the option to reroll the world if you dont want it to be the same as your singleplayer one.,Torchlight,cicf8fj,1,t5_2rb10

2393972,0,t3_2mt0c6,I think the big difference between TL and PoE is that since TL has no economy or crafting youll actually find items that are upgrades more than once a week. I like PoEs endgame maps more than the mapworks I havent checked is it possible to mod mapworks maps with more extensive affixes? TL doesnt have desyncs if youre playing alone. TL characters are much faster than PoE characters. Personally I like the art design in TL more particularly Act. Mod support is nice if youre like me and need to hold on to a copy of each unique you find. Theres also the unearthed arcana mod which adds back a bunch of content that Runic cut before release.,Torchlight,cm7lp96,2,t5_2rb10

2578897,0,t1_cmux8rt,Act I amp II are all about maxing your HP pool Act III amp IV are about having the lvl  Wazir set  damage reduction. Act IIIIV are pretty much impossible without the Wazir set or some other way of obtaining around  dmg red overall.Skill build doesnt even matter that much most builds do more than enough damage.As you alluded to in your post you just have to build your character so as to not get  shot. Once you figure that out its actually quite simple.and I think Im around level ?,Torchlight,cmv77a2,1,t5_2rb10

3353529,0,t1_cpafgl5,If youd like some math to go with that Torchlight  has more players online than Rift which is a freaking MMO obviously this only counts people who log in through Steam and its only about  players behind Path of Exile which requires you to be online.Dead gaem is about perspective.

4396814,0,t3_3bcmgr,Nevermind I figured it out. For future reference set the base ice magic damage to equal .chance to proc for both min and max fields.. is the damage of one glacial spike at level .Chance to proc is calculated as pnpn.... where each p represents a probability to proc from one source and each n represents the number of sources for its respective p. For example a hammer of retribution socketed with two eyes of aleera would give ....This should give a rudimentary estimate of glacial spike dps.,Torchlight,csl984a,2,t5_2rb10

I do know that you can reroll the worldmap when you create a game. Also when you are exploring you run into other charactersNPCs who have quests for you in different dungeonscaves and whatnot. Hopefully someone else can chime in but Id imagine the reroll world feature would keep it interesting.,Torchlight,ctp7ibc,0,t5_2rb10
4824958,0,t3_3gy0fh,Im still reading and will update my comment when I form an opinion on the build but I wanted to go ahead and thank you for this post.

5359103,0,t1_cvwo7o3,Its exactly like Diablo in that each successive play through is the same game with stronger monsters. I think there are  or  playthroughs not sure. ,Torchlight,cvwopdp,2,t5_2rb10

5853811,0,t1_cxmsapn,Fair enough but literally the ONLY reason why I ask is because no matter how I level any of the characters I feel so damn weak while leveling up. I dont know if its intentional or not but in most other ARPGS I play I can mow mobs down with the few selection of skills I have but in TL it takes me forever to kill mobs no matter what I use. And thats in NORMAL difficulty. Just want a good leveling build to springboard me towards the late game,Torchlight,cxmyo38,1,t5_2rb10
6106166,0,t1_cyjo63y,Right. And the difficulty never really increases the further you level which is boring. With my mod you have to grind to get past NG,Torchlight,cyjpiwv,1,t5_2rb10

8931676,0,t1_d7lffqx,Focus applies to fire weapon damage because that falls under elemental weapon damage. Skills that convert your weapon damage to a specific element ignore the all the elemental types listed on the weapon.. Weapon damage gets boosted if it is not physical. Damage over time also gets boosted even physical damage over time. In addition to direct hits from the weapon skills that deal  weapon damage also fall under this clause and are boosted as long as they are elemental. Skills that deal  weapon damage as X element convert all damage from the weapon to Xelement overriding the elements listed on the weapon itself.. Focus boosts pure nonweapon spell damage regardless of what element it is. Spells that deal  weapon damage count as weapon damage NOT spell damage and are not affected by this clause.Its easy to see that these two clauses never overlap since it is impossible to be weapon damage and nonweapon damage at the same time. The only thing these two clauses do not cover is physical weapon damage.,Torchlight,d7lgewi,1,t5_2rb10
