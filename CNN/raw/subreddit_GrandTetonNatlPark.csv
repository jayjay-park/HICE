6322525,0,t1_cz7qdze,Ill be going in ether early June or midAugust. As far as experience goes Ive climbed is Mt Washington in NH and while its half the elevation of GT its still pretty dangerous. Climbed Clingmans Dome in NC. Ive also done some pretty vertical scramblingbouldering in the Santa Monica Mountains the Smokies and Kentucky. Im definitely not an expert but Ive done all of those climbs without guides or gear so I think I have a realistic understanding of my capabilities. And with that said Ive never used climbing gear and ropes in an actual setting on my own so I almost trust myself more without gear than with it. But if I could rent some ropes I wouldnt be opposed to using them if I needed too.Do you have any idea how much time it takes your friend to run up and down the trail?Im kind of all or nothing when it comes to these types of things so I havent really considered any other peaks but Ill look into it.Thanks for the feedback its much apprieciated!,GrandTetonNatlPark,cz8avhr,1,t5_38xee
