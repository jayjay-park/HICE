223597,0,t3_1wn3cd,I love this show.  I remember reading an interview with Moffat where he talked about the idea behind the show.  On its surface obviously its a show about six friends and the many pitfalls of dating.  But he mentioned that the show has another motivating level.  Since its about relationships each character can be interpreted as a different position on the confidence spectrum.  Jeff and Sally are hopelessly lacking in confidence Jeff sometimes finds himself with one too many legs and Sally is terrified of growing old.  Patrick and Jane are on the extreme of overconfidence Patrick has a cupboard of love and Jane is so vain she assumes shes being stalked by an elaborate conspiracy of men.  In the middle of both of these poles we have Susan and Steve.  The normal ones loosely modeled after Steve Moffat and his partner if I recall correctly.Because of this whenever we see the guys talking at the bar and the women talking at the winebar we are actually seeing what its like inside the mind of a person in a relationship.  Weve all got that voice of overconfidence and that voice of panic at all times.  When we internally analyze our recent date or her lack of batteries its like were having that bar conversation in our own heads.,NetflixBestOf,cf3wven,6,t5_2ro0h

Amazing and unexplained things happen to people all the time and we never figure out precisely why. Its about how those characters respond to those circumstances. Its telling that no character on LOST no matter how deep you go ever can give you a full explanation as to what is happening. The best they can do is give their interpretation. Some of them seem to be backed up by events some of them are clearly wrong and some are knowingly deceiving others or being deceived themselves. I think in  years well look back and be thankful that LOST didnt bother with clearing up its inherent ambiguity. To do so would have been dishonest to the premise of the show. Its sometimes vague and often sloppy but it was almost always compelling and fascinating and very frequently moving.,NetflixBestOf,chs78ti,2,t5_2ro0h

1236135,0,t1_ci8mdqv,Eh I couldnt tell you for sure but my educated guess is that it has something to do with the nature of anime studios pulling all of their content from streaming services to promote the selling of their DVDs.  Thats why it always seems to be that tons of anime are pulled at once rather than only a few because theyll take close to their entire catalog of shows that are on the streaming service.  The studios themselves may have their content on other streaming services from which they get more royalties and therefore pull their content from Netflix.  Again these are just guesses.

1291252,0,t1_cidqfra,Actually over and above the content of the movie is the problem that truthers have with the truth.  The most recent act of deception and evasion is the pamphlets they handed out at the  memorial that just happened to look almost exactly like the pamphlets handed out by the curators.  Quite a coincidence.And then theres my favorite the movie created by the Pilots for  Truth whatever a while ago that compared driving a car down a narrow crooked road with curbs on both sides to flying the planes when if you havent checked recently there are no curbs in the air and in fact the planes on  didnt have to make any such violent maneuvers they just flew straight into the buildings.Same movie they ask if you could park your car in a garage at high speeds when the real question is could you crash your car into your garage if it was sitting In the middle of the Bonneville salt flats the later being obviously true the former just smoke and mirrors.  They showed the car stopping inches from the rear of the garage suicidal parkers wouldnt worry about stopping.Its possible that the flawed reasoning of Truthers beginning with the conclusion instead of concluding with the conclusion for one thing really does cause them to believe there are curbs in the sky because their tortured thinking requires them to be there and they really honestly dont see their deceptions for what they are.Or recruiting new believers justifies a little enhancement of the evidence because its for a good cause whatever.I could go on and on and on Ill save electrons by just summarizing with Truthers Lie.

Ireland does not levy withholding tax on certain receipts from European Union member States. Revenues from income of sales of the products shipped by the second Irish company are first booked by a shell company in the Netherlands taking advantage of generous tax laws there Overcoming the Irish tax system the remaining profits are transferred directly to Cayman Islands or Bermuda Thus if the two Irish holding companies are thought of as bread and the Netherlands company as cheese this scheme is referred to as the Dutch sandwich.   The Irish authorities never see the full revenues and hence cannot tax them even at the low Irish corporate tax rates There are equivalent Luxembourgish and Swiss sandwiches.gtInteresting Criticism of Facebook | Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland | Abbott Laboratories | Facebook Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcky oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecky.

Its really the Networks where I see a complete lack of depth and appreciation for the audiences intelligence. Most cable channels are willing to be a bit smarter and assume the best of their audience like a Breaking Bad or Sons of Anarchy. They follow more of an HBO model the master of American TV where they feel that if there is a great story to tell then the story itself is worth it and the audience will be intrigued enough to figure it out.The Networks on the other hand feel like they need to make sure the audience is uptospeed on everything at all times. They fear if a new viewer comes into their show and they dont know whats going on than that viewer will change channels.

The story was very interesting and intriguing. But with all the hype and compliments it go it got over hyped. I couldnt enjoy it as I wanted to as how the anime community reacted with all the support. And a second thought this anime could of been an ongoing series if it was more extended with new enemies and adventures. It probably wouldnt get as much regonition as ongoing series are usually full of fillers which loses the fans interest.

2845777,0,t1_cnrjg52,yes you have got a point there. This is something that comes up a lot between Europeans and Americans regarding the cold war. It has something to do with recent history Europe on the whole thinks of international politics as a delicate affair whereas the USA is in the position of power. As a result a lot of European education addresses nuances and interactions in power because they have depended  on it.The conflict between the USA and USSR was indirect it only really heated up on foreign soil or was mostly fought out between intelligence agencies from satellite states. The UK had lost its empire in the second world war and its power was slipping. They were in the middle of what the doctrine at the time considered to be battle field Europe where both super powers thought WWIII would be fought. So they were worried they would become dependent on the USA reduced to a mere a satellite state. As a result they sought a position of power to negotiate at multilateral negotiations.The UK actually did exceptionally well with he means and resources they had opting for creative individual operations instated of power by numbers and as a result they stayed a dominant force on the world stage in the intelligence community probably on equal foot with the French who were less gentleman like an more ruthless and more efficient as a result.But when I look back at it it probably is a spy movie that is firmly based in English European culture and political understanding. Its workings are subtle delicate and take along time to take hold. ,NetflixBestOf,cnrkbi5,8,t5_2ro0h

They never show you that but its a hidden gem into his drive.  You then see him with a look of disgust as he lays there with a broken leg while the people he brought out get to strike it rich off of his find.spoiler.

3058991,0,t1_cof0ye7,Im conflicted on it. On the one hand its an original take on a genre that often follows the same tropes or varies them in predictable ways our zombies run our zombies are smart our zombies are actually infected etc.. On the other hand it does require a huge suspension of disbelief because it betrays everything that we know about virus transmission. I thought The two principle actors were competent with the material they had Stephen McHattie was particularly fantastic. I liked the bottle episode approach to the film though I admit that Ive always had an affinity for that style choice. In the end I think it may have been a better play than film as Im generally more willing to accept the experimental leaps the plot offered in that format but its certainly a unique competent entry into the zombie genre and it gets points for that. Id probably rate it  or  out of  and show it to friends who I know like the genre warts and all or like quirky for lack of a better term films. ,NetflixBestOf,cof288t,14,t5_2ro0h

Like Frank or Chris I should say treated it all as a joke but still kind of expected to hit it big while all the other people around him were actually getting famous by properly managing their antics but by the time Chris realized he should have treated the business side of his Frank persona a little more seriously it was too late.   I think a lot of the mental illness aspects come from guys like Daniel Johnston where their illness is what prevented them from becoming the next Bob Dylan.  Chris mismanaging the Frank personal doesnt exactly compare to Daniel Johnstons schizophrenia.  ,NetflixBestOf,conbgyf,1,t5_2ro0h

3296397,0,t3_2xwjnr,Mrs. Brisby is the greatest mom in movie history! Shes average in smarts and abilities but she screams and fights her way through her deepest fears and you can really feal every bit if it to save her children. Her husband was a bona fide hero among the animals of NIMH but she was just Mom until called upon in impossibly tragic times to respond to an impossible threat. Her husband left her with a lot of powerful friends who were deeply indebted to him and honored to help his widow in repayment of those old debts. There is wisdom power corruption honor overcoming human folly and the fight for the underdog  every element needed for a great modern myth and its presented in a sensually stunning way. The music and the sound design form a seamless whole with the breathtaking beauty of the animation and character design. The cast was just brilliant from Derek Jacobi John Carradine and Elizabeth Hartman down to the kids including Shannen Doherty and what must have been a tiny little Wil Wheaton at age  or so. Dom Delouise plays the same character he plays in every movie hes ever made but the role of Jeremy seems to have been written specifically for him to provide his special brand of comic relief not just to the audience but also to the desperate widow in her deepest hour of need. Im a bit sad feeling like Ive just seen the last of the great classically animated feature films.

One also doesnt need to champion a specific cause only to highlight the evil of one  such as by contrasting words used by showing how living situations still arent that great. One doesnt need to have a specific person as a villain when the cause is to show the villainy of a system. The purpose of propaganda is to lead a person to a specific end  which is what this does. Given that the directors previous effort has the same antiglobalist message and doesnt tell the truth about farming its obvious what the intention is. If thats what you believe good for you.

Critical reception of the series was mixed. Benji Wilson of The Daily Telegraph criticized the first episode for being underwhelming writing that although the series showcased plenty of footage of the whales its hard for television to communicate their awesome bigness. Amol Rajan of The Independent voiced a similar concern pointing out that there was a failure to convey the sheer size of these beasts because the only thing we had to compare them with was each other. Rajan did praise the show for its underwater photography calling it stunning. Phil Hogan of The Guardian disliked the slow pacing of the series writing that it seemed to take hours to get the whales in and out of shot. Hogan commented that it was difficult to distinguish scenes of the humpback whales in battle with scenes of the whales merely swimming although there was action to be had... with killer whales.WikipediaMore info at IMDb Freebase Wikipedia  I am a bot.

I cant remember if its the same creator producers or writers or a combination Im on my phone and feeling lazy but it has a similar feel although really not a similar show. Damages is sort of a legal procedural but it has over arching storylines and the same sort of nonchronological storytelling. The cast is stellar with great supporting actors who change from season to season. Glen Close is phenomenal.

5117494,0,t1_cv21zxa,That reminds me of China Mivilles thoughts on crime novels. Really they apply to any novel or film where a mystery is central whether its horror conspiracy thriller whatever kind of mystery youd call Lost or crime fictiongt Secondly detective novels are not novels of detection still less of revelation still less of solution. Those are all necessary but not only are they insufficient but they are in certain ways regrettable. These are novels of potentiality. Quantum narratives. Their power isnt in their final acts but in the profusion of superpositions before them the couldbes whatifs and neverknows. Until that final chapter each of those is as real and true as all the others jostling realities all dreamed up by the crime none trapped in vulgar facticity. Thats why the most important sentence in a murder mystery isnt the one starting The murderer is  which no matter how necessary and fabulously executed is an act of unspeakable narrative winnowing   but is the snarled expostulation halfway through Everyones a suspect. Quite. When all those suspects become one certainty its a collapse and a letdown. How can it not be? Weve been banished from an Eden of oscillation.Its not just scarier to imagine the possibilities than for them to collapse into one truth its more exciting. Its next to impossible for an unambiguous ending to be as frightening or suspenseful or intellectually puzzling as the middle. Which is not to say that every horror or mystery or crime story should have an ambiguous ending.  Sometimes its more frustrating than exciting but thats what makes it so hard. You cant have your cake and eat it too.,NetflixBestOf,cv2ule2,6,t5_2ro0h

I dont need a show to tell me these things certainly not one that does with a sloppy plot that doesnt hold together.

The Crow was a great movie that didnt hold up but I think it was for different reasons than the matrix.  The Crow really captured the mood and feelings of my generation the angst ridden grunge scene the desire to get revenge on assholes its hard to explain.  It was a film that explored the same concepts as the popular music of the day.  It doesnt hold up because we all grew up.

It helped watching it with the thought that this movie set the trend and appreciate it for what it is which really is the best example of such a movie.

5767212,0,t3_3u3l7o,Sticking to Netflix Continuum is a Canadian scifi show that while not quite top shelf in all aspects is nonetheless often quite engaging.  It was meant to go longer but managed nonetheless to shake a th season out of whatever investorsnetworks in order to wrap up the story.The European NF regions Ive seen seem to be stuck at having the first season or two.  U.S. NF just picked up season .Season  in particular starts to get pretty funky with shifting alliances and perspectives.You may have heard of Josh Whedons one season scifi or something wonder Firefly.  If you havent check it out.  While it got killed off you can also enjoy two seasons of similar quality work of his in Dollhouse.  Dont let the title put you off it has excellent writing and acting.Of course Whedon made his name with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and spinoff Angel.  You may or may not go for that but if you havent tried it you may want to.  It looks a bit campy and as some point out the first season stories struck them as a bit simpler.  Nonetheless the writing and characters engender a fierce loyalty among its fans  including many academics and people whose attention and regard if nothing else might temp you to take a look.Someone else mentioned The Killing.  I would recommend the original Danish version.  U.K. NF had the first two seasons subtitled until a few months ago.  Shame on them for dropping it.  They are still available in the Netherlands or France if you can do Dutch or French subtitles.  In particular though the French subtitles are greatly simplified over the actual dialogue.Someone else mentioned The Bridge BronBroen.  Also quite engaging.  The U.S. NF doesnt have it yet but many other regions have the first season or two.While on the topic of foreign language dramas Spiral French title Engrenages is excellent particularly the first two seasons.  It disappeared from U.S. NF for some months but now is back.  For a while NF had reduced many regions to just the fourth season  apparently they were outbid andor didnt reup the first three  and the U.K. may still be in that state.  But as said theyre all back in the U.S. region.Something that is NOT on NF nor apparently much of anywhere else is the Canadian coroner yep and police drama Da Vincis Inquest.  Its excellent and provides an excellent portrayal of contemporary Vancouver.  I wish it would show up somewhere  thus my shameless plug here.,NetflixBestOf,cxbz4vk,10,t5_2ro0h

That morning they let us vote on what movie we want to watch. The three options they gave us were Back to the Future The Empire Strikes Back and Jumanji. So now Im excited because I figure Empire is a shoein and if not wed get to see Back to the Future. Now I had nothing against Jumanji at the time but it was a relatively new movie and every self respecting child had seen it in the theaters like  months prior. So needless to say these fucking mutants all voted for Jumanji and what could have been an epic viewing of one of my all time favorite movies turned into fucking Jumanji.

6251448,0,t3_40ywj4,Im usually skeptical of news like this as it is most often simply legal jargon thrown out there to appease the greedy movies corporations like the MPAA. This happened awhile ago when Netflix updated their TOS to make it clear they have the right to terminate your account if you use these programs that circumvent geoblocking restrictions. So far Ive never heard of anybody whose account was actually shut down.If Netflix indeed starts to enforce this rule then sadly I will be cancelling my subscription and going back to full time piracy or perhaps trying out some of the various other streaming services that have popped up since I got my Netflix subscription several years back. The movie catalog in my region Canada has drastically improved over the last year or two but it is still severely lacking when compared to other regions most notably the USA.I understand Netflix is probably under a ton of pressure from American corporations like the MPAA who are determined to control the internet and entertainment industries so I dont hold it against them personally. But I will continue the fight against those greedy motherfuckers until they stop desperately trying to continue an antiquated business model that is inconvenient and absurdly expensive for the consumer.Consumers nowadays like myself want flexibility and convenience and want to get the best bang for their buck. These assholes need to realize that for the first time in history they have the biggest and most efficient system of distribution at their fingertips  the internet  and they need to start finding ways to embrace it and adapt to modern technology rather than fighting it. Other industries like music are already starting to figure this out.,NetflixBestOf,cz080jt,2,t5_2ro0h

But other than that I was pretty underwhelmed. It feels like a lot of people really liked it solely because it attempted to ape s movies and relies heavily on nostalgia factors. There were some parts that did feel in line with that s goal but most felt like a very low budget modern day flick. Which it was. Films like The Running Man Big Trouble and Mad Max werent as bankrolled as huge AAA blockbusters are today but they still had a real movie budget. Maybe with a better budget this would have been able to achieve that a lost film from the s effect. ,NetflixBestOf,czpcvyj,1,t5_2ro0h
6478335,0,t1_czp2nv7,Breaking Bad is like really good really pure crystal meth. Its superbly written directed paced photographed and acted and provides you with a high octane thrill ride that hardly makes a wrong move barrelling through plot and themes with grace depth and billions of catharsis all the way through a difficult combination to pull off never mind for five seasons solid.Mad Men is more like a fine wine it drifts through Don Drapers and his cohorts lives and world. You meditate on the context the settings the people. To keep using the shitty analogy you swish it around in your mouth and you start to get a sense of the full flavour. You get a lot more time to think about the ideas it presents. Just like even in its conflicts Don and the others keep making the same sorts of mistakes over and over again. My real memory of watching Mad Men is how immersive it was  I started to feel like I really was in those offices in the s in amongst all that music and culture. And eventually in Dons head.I loved them both more or less equally but they are totally different. The main similarity and difference kinda is that they both deal primarily with the idea of changes. BB discusses changes that come hard fast and purposefully. MM is more about changes that happen slowly and subtly without certain people necessarily wanting them to ie society relationships or changes that dont happen at all ie within our own personality.Fucking hell I love those shows so much.

The main point critics and viewers have had against the series is how unlikely the scenario is. The USA backing out of NATO? The European Union sanctioning the occupation of Norway by Russia? And why in the world would Russia who is one of the largest producers of oil and gas even care if Norway became a full flegded green nation wouldnt that mean less competition for them?I honestly stopped watching the series it just became too dumb.

6555382,0,t3_45elnf,For anyone who watches this and wonders why the filming style is different from the show and some of the story doesnt line up with the show heres what I remember of the explanation  The movie assumes that TPB the show is actually a documentary.  The idea is that the documentary was popular enough that the rights to the characters stories were sold to a studio and the movie was made.  However Ricky Julian and Bubbles did not approve of any of the actors who auditioned so everyone just played themselves.  So the result is a Hollywood style movie that is a slightly fictionalized version of TPB which is why it looks different and doesnt fit in with the shows continuity.  I imagine that the real explanation is simply that they wanted to appeal to a broader audience with the movie to attract new fans to the show but I like that they provided an inuniverse reason for the movie to be different.  ,NetflixBestOf,czxdoox,29,t5_2ro0h

And while the first season is pretty monsteroftheweek driven it doesnt take long to get recurring story lines and intricate arcs. The characters are captivating and John Noble Walter is quite possibly the best character on any show Ive watched. Anna Torv Olivia is often mistaken for a wooden actor but theres a reason and she shows her acting talent in the second season on. As you can tell Im a fan.

I doubt Kendrick will ever release an album anywhere similar to s MDBTF Yeezus or Life of Pablo Kanye has largely shifted his focus to production. After his first couple albums he put a lot less into his vocals and really expanded on his sampling beats and such. The fact that Kanye writes performs and produces most of his shit feeds into his ego complex. Hes obviously a control freak. I mean hes crazy influential and obviously one of the most talked about figures of pop culture. Pretty much every album hes released has inspired a  subgenre of people emulating him.Kendrick is very lyrically driven. Hes far more a story teller and not at all a producer. Like he obviously has a very clear vision and direction in all of his projects but he just doesnt seem as egocentric about its production as Kanye.

Its iconic figure for more than  years was Joe Paterno the head coach of the schools storied football team who took on mythic national stature as Saint Joe. But then in November  everything came crashing down. Former Assistant Coach Jerry Sandusky was charged with  counts of child sex abuse. Filmed over the course of the year after Sanduskys arrest HAPPY VALLEY chronicles the ensuing firestorm of accusations about who failed to protect Happy Valleys children. Director Amir BarLev creates a parable of guilt responsibility and identity for a small town caught in the glare of the national spotlight.IMDbCritical receptiongt Happy Valley received positive reviews from critics. Justin Chang of Variety said in his review that Amir BarLev offers a typically gripping and thoughtful take on the Penn State scandal. John DeFore in his review for The Hollywood Reporter praised the film saying that Amir BarLevs Happy Valley is more concerned with the phenomenon of team spirit than any single question of fact or moral judgment. Eric Kohn Vaughan of Indiewire graded the film with a B and said Happy Valley turns the tables on the national perception of the scandal. Looking directly into the camera after the team has been banned by the league one supporter shouts Stop putting all the bad stuff on TV! The words resonate for anyone who has followed the headlines from the past several years. Watching Happy Valley its hard not to feel complicit in the universitys weakened state.WikipediaMore info at IMDb Wikipedia Rotten Tomatoes Freebase  I am a bot. Send me feedback Confidence ..

So I dont think it received a lot of press from Variety and other Hollywood people. It was competing against The Sixth Sense. I think this movie is better but most people would say The Sixth Sense is the better movie or the one they remember more. Eddie Murphy mostly played a dork.

The first is a telling expose of how a modern military reduces individuals with all their personal codes of morality into an efficient organization devoted to the destruction of those humans cast as enemies to the point where they will destroy their own.Spoilers may follow.The second part examines the banality of evil. Is the sniper any more or less moral than the soldiers? Did she experience a similar training regimen that stripped her of her ideological reasons for subsuming her human empathy or was she killing for the reason she first took up a gun. From an American perspective should we care that she manages to kill a few Marines or should we accept that AD the statistical outcome of what we saw in the first part of the movie humans reduced to a numbers game? And is our visceral reaction to those deaths of people we dont or shouldnt even really like we see Animals character early on and are exposed to it throughout the film this is not someone wed be happy our sister was dating an explanation of how the American public reacted to a victory in the Tet Offensive? Is everyone who gets buried in a flagdraped casket a hero by virtue of their service? What if its compelled? Or do we judge them instead by the content of their character?And then the final scene which ought to haunt every citizen that sends our children to war without considering that they are in fact children sent to do an abhorrent task. Is it necessary? Was it worth their corruption? And what burden have we saddled them with? Could we carry it ourselves? If we could would we under the circumstances weve asked of them?Movies can be entertainment or art.

7839204,0,t1_d3wrqyt,As a huge fan of the guys behind this movie I can second From Beyond and recommend a bunch of their other work.Castle Freak is directed and produced by the director and coproducer of ReAnimator and is also based on a Lovecraft story  loosely  and stars Barbara Crampton and Jeffrey Combs. Its not as wacky as ReAnimator but its a great movie.Space Truckers is very very far away from ReAnimator in tone and content but it has the same intentionally campy vibe and is directed by the same guy Stuart Gordon. Its about... Space Truckers. One of which is played by Dennis Hopper. His crew ends up transporting the humanoid war machines that a scientist was paid to make by an evil CEO. They end up attacked by said scientist after the CEO betrays him and they basically fight amongst themselves and the robots. Also features a cyborg penis with a ripcord starter.Necronomicon is a fun anthology from ReAnimators producer Brian Yuzna. Its comprised of shorts based on Lovecraft stories and features Jeffrey Combs as Lovecraft himself. The segments were directed by Yuzna himself Shusuke Kaneko  the man behind the s Gamera movies  and Silent Hill director Christophe Gans. Effects by Tom Savini and Screaming Mad George. Really fun movie.Yuzna also directed two sequels to ReAnimator that arent as good but continue the story well enough and feature effects by Screaming Mad George. He also directed a social satire horror called Society that discussed the horror of the ruling class from a lower class perspective. The less I spoil the better but its hilarious surreal and the ending is pure insanity once again provided by Screaming Mad George. These guys have fun with movies. Theyre great at what they do. They may not always make GREAT movies but theyre always fun. Give their stuff a shot.,NetflixBestOf,d3x705e,5,t5_2ro0h

8733363,0,t3_4zlw1a,Unfortunately the movie is well made but is severely lacking in what the book offers meaningful commentary. What makes The Road so beautiful is the strength of the prose and what it has to say about living in an apocalyptic landscape the story is slow and somewhat dull and not much happens but the way the book is written with its painful apocalyptic descriptions of the bleak world that the characters live in is immensely beautiful but like I said its still very slow which is why the somewhat sparse action serves as a nice intermission between the powerful and meditative prose. So when you watch the movie you get none of the beautiful writing whatsoever and must solely rely on the few and sparse intense moments of action which only slightly manage to drag you through the bleak and ultimately pointless struggle of the characters and In the end youll end up wishing you had read the book but when you finally do get around to it all of the action will be spoiled by the movie and thus the book seems much less well rounded because you only have excellent prose but no real drama because youve already experienced it.  ,NetflixBestOf,d6xbeo4,1,t5_2ro0h

8875532,0,t1_d7ekdnx,gtpeople feel more comfortable around others who are like them. This is quite true though there are always novelty seekers and cultural ambassadors that actively enjoy spreading and learning other cultures theyve always been few in number. The thing is when you create an environment with sharply defined lines there is no room for these intergroup travelers to spread the good qualities of cultures around. For example Southern Americans are widely considered to be the most racist backwards and uneducated people on the planet. It is the butt of many internet jokes. Yet they have a hospitality tradition that is almost as strong as desert nomad tribes which developed their hospitality traditions based on mutual survival in harsh environments. Some people will say that the world would be a better place if Southern culture were completely eradicated and effectively consider them a hate group. If that Southern tradition of hospitality made it into mainstream American culture then the world would be a slightly better place. Thats becoming less and less possible as being a southerner even in part is considered a negative connotation. Those are the cultural walls locking down. So is black people fading other black people for being too white. So is cultural policing. Its all bullshit. ,NetflixBestOf,d7eppir,1,t5_2ro0h

Great disaster movie they spent half the movie just building it up instead of opening with people dying and shit blowing up everywhere like so many American disaster movies. Then we watched both Pontypool and He Never Died because wed seen neither. Enjoyed both thoroughly I think I like He Never Died more than Pontypool but both were completely entertaining. Oh and they do actually have a theme that makes them fit together they are both scififantasy with little to no special effects and they work brilliantly that way.

I didnt like Click just because the life lesson it supposedly tried to give was muddied by the fact that if that fucking remote control just followed instructions and didnt interpret things like a complete and total idiot he would have been fine but I can see why people wouldnt mind that movie either. First Dates was great Mr. Deeds was OK Reign Over Me was a step away from his usual style but still a nice enough flick and The Longest Yard was fine too.

11666225,0,t3_5p6nmg,Just watched this on Netflix thought it was a reasonable film. As someone said the characters were a little onedimensional but otherwise it was interesting.Im a fan of the zombie genre anyway so I simply found it satisfied my Zthirst for the moment and entertained me for  minutes.  I pretty much guessed the plot and the twist when she saw the little girl at the refugee camp before they were taken to the resort. I did find it interesting that the zombies perhaps had some memory in them. With that female Z that the bosslady kept taunting ending up going after her and pointing and screaming at her in recognition. I liked the moral questions it brought up with having someone like Sadie being a Zombie rights activist type wondering if the humanity is still left in them after they turn and the general idea that has humanity itself lost its compassion care factor etc.  I did find it timely they mentioned a world that hardly cares about its displaced people which meant people were willing to accept sacrificing innocent people and that this corporation got away with these unspeakable acts for as long as they did because as long as these people were someone elses problem they just didnt care. Just seemed very timely to me. ,NetflixBestOf,dgidr4x,2,t5_2ro0h
