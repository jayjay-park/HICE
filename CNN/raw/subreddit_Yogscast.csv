Again using the Bethesda example would the deal be exclusive to certain creators like Sips or creators with a certain requirments like X amount of subs? You mentioned Lewis in particular saying no to games and his channel is obviously the biggest. How likely would it be for someone with a smaller channel lets say Nilesy to be allowed make that video instead?Basically my question is about personal opinions. Everyone has different tastes in games so would a deal that has high regulations about whats acceptable just be completely vetoed by you Lewis or whoever or would someone with a genuine interest in the game still be allowed to take part of it?,Yogscast,cev91ju,1,t5_2sg86

They have to be willing to eliminate and allbuteliminated people need to learn to gracefully continue the game despite almost no chance of victory.I like the idea of lovers and fighters but when it comes to multiplayer everyones gotta be willing to fight a bit.

Using them to make Great Works will also boost culture and for the first few GWs you get it is more culture in the long run. That Duncan isnt building it yet is fine if his goal is to grow Haggis faster Writer slots take away from food production but at some point GP production becomes so much more beneficial than pure resources it is how Lewis won the last game despite Duncans humongous lead and part of that loss can be attributed imo to the lack of a Writers Guild ,Yogscast,cfnxpec,4,t5_2sg86

502373,0,t3_1ztvqi,I dont believe that attack from Lewis was coincidental at all. In fact I think he had planned since the start of the war to attack Sjin right after attacking Duncan. He saw that even then Sjin was pulling ahead. If he couldve he wouldve attacked Sjin at that crucial moment and almost definitely wouldve won. However Duncan was in the way. He had to break through Haggis to get to Sjin. You see Lewis was at an impass. Sjin was pulling ahead while he had little room to expand and grow. He knew Sjin was already in the lead and could have plenty of land to expand to and he does while Lewis had just a little and didnt have much of a chance to play catchup. Sjin had to be deal with. Lucky for Lewis he was Rome. So Lewis decided that hed use the timing attack to cut Sjin down to size and set himself up to lead the game. Once Sjin was down there would only be a weak Duncan Parv and Hannah and a bronzeage Zoey to defeat him. But Duncan was in the way. Specifically Haggis was in the way. He could not attack Sjin without going through Duncan assuming he didnt want to sail for centuries undefended in Sjins vague direction with no hope of reinforcement. So he had to take Haggis. This shouldve been easy enough but Duncan was able to hold out for an improbably long amount of time. This time period that Duncan delayed for may well be the most crucial few turns in the entire game. In it Lewis timing attack was squandered Sjin was allowed to pull ahead even farther and Lewis was forced to commit to a bloody unprofitable war. In the end this was definitely good for him. Taking Haggis makes him all the more powerful but its of little consequence.Now his best opportunity to take down Sjin has been lost. Sjin will be able to continue progressing unhindered in any way. Of course this isnt to say Lewis is done for. No hes still by far the best player of the bunch. He can catch up and thats exactly what hes planning to do. My guess is hell spend a very long time building up his civ. Hes got a lot of land to choose from now that Duncan is out of the picture and Duncan has two cities that would come in handy later on. As well as knock out Duncan who might develop into an actual threat later on. As for the other players Parv is weak but not destroyed. He could catch up and by the end of the game he might actually start to seriously matter.Duncan is down and bleeding and Lewis looks to be kicking him around next episode. My guess is Lewis will let him survive for now and hell be a minor presence for a while before getting vastly outteched.Hannah is basically a glorified citystate. Shell probably be able to break the standoff soon though and Zoeys lack of technology gold and basically anything will make her an easy target.Zoey is backward to the extreme. Not much can be done for her sadly. She shouldve backed down from the war episodes ago but now she really cant without getting invaded. Of course I think she could actually win. If she backed off half her guys from the front and let the other costly half get destroyed she could tempt Hannah into invading prematurely. Then defend at Risa and let Hannah squandering her few units unable to take the city. Thats the only way I can think of that Zoey might actually start recovering. Even then shes so backward its almost irrelevant. Theyll both be fighting with pikemen when the rest of the lot get machine guns. ,Yogscast,cfxdg3k,3,t5_2sg86

Its still getting tonnes of views somehow so I guess they feel obliged to continue it? I cant help but feeling like if they just called it to a close and played something else instead it would get just as many views and not be quite so... dull.Sips got sick of Minecraft cant really blame him it is very boring now and Sjin seems to be plugging away on his own but the others never interact with him or speak to him or even go to his base even though hes on the same server seems a bit pointless really even having him there.The whole series should really be called Lewis Builds a Base on the Moon at this point as it seems like its just a vehicle for Lewis to dick around with Minecraft mods at this point.,Yogscast,cgs0rm8,5,t5_2sg86

In seeing a slight aimed at a channel I have a great amount of affection for I leapt in with both feet without realising that was unnecessary. There is also a very strong argument to be made that I should perhaps avoid forums of any sort on days where my medication has not been administered fully as that can sometimes bring about conflict where none is required.I hope you accept this apology in the spirit with which it is offered that of absolute sincerity and Ill leave my original comment up only as a warning to myself that if Im going to act like a twat I need to realise that the consequences of those actions will stick around to remind me of my own stupidity.,Yogscast,ch99c1e,2,t5_2sg86

1291767,0,t3_28vgox,I appreciate everyone being interested in the inner workings of the Yogscast and wanting to see behind the fraps aspect of video production but I think these requests are too much. Yogtowers is after all a working environment and while recording gameplay for their channels may sound fun there are undoubtedly a lot of stresses off camera we dont see editing and rendering for example. Requesting someone to follow members around for an entire day takes them away from projects they should be completing. The time taken away from those interviewed may be minimal but could impact their sessions and overall completed work. I would also think that The Yogscast would like to keep some mystery as to what happens in a general day at Yogtowers. Id assume that no two days are the same what with weeping angels and a plants v zombies war but some things they might want to keep to themselves.Working on a construction site may be physically demanding but recording is mentally draining and shouldnt be overlooked. When members are staying late into the evening I wouldnt think its because theyd rather be at the office than watching TV. Theyre working to finish editing or preparing for tomorrow and shouldnt be bothered with something unnecessary. Its a working environment and not every aspect of it should be shown to the curious audience. ,Yogscast,ciexv5d,5,t5_2sg86

On death it drops both wool and leather. It can be milked though Im not sure if its shearable though it stands to reason that it would be.Chests staying open is just a sign of server lag at the time you were closing the chest. Trying to access the chest again and exiting should cause it to close unless the lag is still in effect.Personal anchors are the way to go for anchoring  theyll only act as world anchors whilst the player that placed them is online. Of course since they only work when youre online theyre better used for loading distant areas such as at apiaries in the Nether or your home whilst youre off exploring the Twilight.When exploring for bees itd be a good idea to make an apiarists backpack or two as well quite a few scoops. Unlike the old versions of forestry back in FTBs YogCraft princesses obtained from hives can be either Ignoble Stock or Pristine stock and Ignoble stock will not always produce a new princess at the end of a cross.

In the past devs would get this coverage without needing to bribe the Yogs.And thats where your business sense proves to be lacking Games have a spike of interest at launch courtesy of the mass sendout of review code for example and the yogs cant afford to not cover a game that has a lot of interest  people will be looking for it and the yogs can get high views from it for relatively little effort. YD is designed for when the masses are NOT looking for that game.Oh but they didnt cover Space Engineers when it launched. The trouble is it still hasnt launched. Thats one of the troubles with early access as a model  and I strongly advise watching that. Also Id advise you get rid of the double post.,Yogscast,cj06hp6,1,t5_2sg86

According to Winterkewls statement Lewis demanded the money as soon as he heard about the artist and the k. Which was right at the beginning of the project. So if they had sat on that money all this time only to give to TUG now then effectively they sabotaged the project by taking the money meant for programming the game and sitting on it for two years. If they gave it to TUG two years ago theyve been lying to everyone about how Yogventures was going well on their channel for the last two years.Either way if the k was given to TUG it means Yogscast directly fucked up and lied to everyone.

1497265,0,t1_cj3fzkf,I get where youre coming from but surely its quite obvious that the Yogs play certain games to get views on their videos case and point Minecraft. I think its been said quite often that most of the team dont enjoy playing Minecraft socially which is fine the main reason I watch is for the banter behind the videos but simply because its the most popular game online and the Yogs pioneered the Minecraft Lets play genre that they have to keep up appearances with it.As far as people getting credit for revenue I think its because other creators of videos that play the same game as the Yogs would feel that they are essentially giving the Yogscast money correct? Honestly I feel that this is not justifiabe just because they dont have the subscribers to run a similar campaign along with the Yogs I have a feeling other large gaming channels will be doing something like this soon to compete which is great so there is some healthy competition out there.And hasnt this always been the case?

1539817,0,t3_2bv9y8,The end of the first recording session and heres where the players standLewis A Lewis is still going strong thanks to his stranglehold on religion this game. A second religion has finally been founded in the nearby Indonesian capital but it wont be able to compete with the army of Sushinto missionaries spanning the globe. Japan is top in score largely due to doing decently well in every area. However Lewis has some competition on the horizon. Trottimus A Trott is very much the dark horse this game and has used his isolated start to build up an impressive economy and the best science in the game. Hes still managing to stay in positive happiness so now may be the time to consider expanding. The Trottoman empire no longer has the advantage of being undiscovered by the other civilizations.Alsmiffy B the newly founded city of Greygoosia brings the Russian city total to  while tsar Smiff is using his dominance of the iron market to field swordsman as peacekeepers on the island of blood oranges. Currently Smiff is another player who isnt facing any immediate threats so he can build a strong civilization while he prepares for future conflict. He should pray for uranium in his lands.Parv B Parv is now expanding to his third city as well although strangely also on his starting island. Considering hes playing Polynesia his lack of exploration has been inexplicable. Not having met that citystate on his starting island is unforgivable. However otherwise Parv is doing well. He completed Macchu Picchu this episode and at least hes a player who is keeping expansion in mind.Duncan D Its hard to determine who has been hurt more by the second war of the blood oranges. Despite winning the war Duncan is in negative happiness and running a deficit. Fortunately it turns out that the faithful Indonesians will be able to have an organized religion after all. Duncan could not found a pantheon because theres already been an enhanced religion in the game Lewis but he could still found a religion because the allowed number in the game had not been reached. So in this case Duncan chose his pantheon belief at the same time he chose his other beliefs. Hes going to have a rough time against the Japanese religion however.Tom D The English lands are still burning from the war and Tom the Terrible is going to have a tough time rebuilding and getting back in this game. If he can build up in time for Longbowmen and Ships of the Line hell be able to best Duncan finally. In order to do that though Tom will need to tech up to those units before the other players are fielding battleships and artillery.,Yogscast,cj9ah1v,69,t5_2sg86

1593064,0,t1_cjfy28o,I think this is becuase people didnt watch Hatfilms before yogscast much they used to censor stuff as a kind of long running joke but they stopped An issue arose during some of their later videos about censorship. For their previous videos Hat Films had censored their use of strong language for a comedic effect. Some found this odd as a lot of the banter between the three was directed for more of a mature audience. In the th episode of their online podcast Hat Chat they addressed the issue of swearing and censorship saying that the funniness faded and grew to take up more time editing than was necessary. On a personal level the censorship affected how they spoke with Trott stating we became complacent with our swearing. It actually affected the way we talked. This being said they did not say that bleeps would be taken out all together but would merely be dialed down.Personally i find the bleeping quite funny when it is used occasionally as it allows the watcher to fill in the gap....,Yogscast,cjfz5do,25,t5_2sg86

1600200,0,t1_cjgt494,Hi! Glad to see you commenting on this series as well. I expect Ill get a lot of criticism which I like. Its the only way to get better. Im in no way a genius at Civ I am pretty much a Prince player though I suspect Id win at least some of my games on King.So take these reponse posts not as excuses or trying to prove you wrong but more just a little bit of help to let you guys know what I was thinking at the time if I didnt say it out loud in the video.Anyway! The reason for Sweden is well obvious. But I also do like them a lot. With correct specialist usage you can benefit a lot from the increased amount of Great Persons. If I manage to stay fairly peaceful this game Ill make good use of the Great Scientists to reach SPACE!The tilelocking is something I simply forgot to change back which is quite annoying. The start is so slow because of that and I didnt realize it was a stupid mistake like that. Oh well. I wont notice for a couple of episodes so prepare to be annoyed about that for a while...The decision for the shrine was a tough one but I really wanted to get the social policies rolling  and I dont go for Legalism as an early social policy with this starting build. I was fairly confident Id get a good religion or at least a pantheon without all out rushing.I was considering renaming Stockholm to Malm but Im gonna name my second city Malm instead.,Yogscast,cjgvhit,61,t5_2sg86

1733104,0,t1_cjxkyj3,Skipped a word there.This is the problem with them showing a game like this from the very beginning. We dont know how in depth the mechanics are or how tactical the game will be later on. If the levels progress and nothing new is introduced then yes you are right it might as well be flash game.Thats what my botched last sentence was supposed to mean. We havent seen that much of it yet.If by flash game you mean the aestheticgraphics well thatll just come down to personal preference. But Id like to mention FTL. This game also has VERY a simple aesthetic and graphics but is a really fun game due to its mechanics.As for Robocraft Ive been playing it for a bit and I wouldnt say its pay to win. More pay to progress which isnt great either. As far as I noticed all the equipment you can get with money is also obtainable with just playing the game and grinding.The equipment is tiered so if someone buys their way into a better robot hell just end up with players with the same level of gear. Although I did notice some people circumvent this by making a very small vehicle and sticking the most powerful weapon they could on it without being catapulted to the next tier.I wouldnt sink any money into it myself but still a fun game and by no means would I call it unplayable due it businesses model.,Yogscast,cjxmess,5,t5_2sg86

Ill miss having Lewis almost play up to the antagonist role and the humour of everyones several attempts to ally themselves to rally against him but ultimately I feel all the series have ended on a bit of a bum note. For me its the drama and the grudges that make the entertainment in the Civ videos. This is what most of them are getting bogged down in and allowing Lewis to discreetly work his way to a victory. I think maybe this is the problem for me Lewis is playing the game with much more focussed goals in a game where first to the post ends the game. This is by no stretch a bad thing hes just playing differently to the others but it does mean that the entire series comes a sudden end  theres no final scramble for anyone to win no buildup just a sudden here is my army.It has its pros  it does stop a season from running on and on to the point it gets boring.

So really its a hobby for when Im bored and dont want to do anything for a portfolio at  the moment.As far as buying a tablet I think cintiqs are of a very high quality and widely used but they are so expensive its stupid. If you are new to digital art I would suggest starting with something without the screen like a bamboo or intuos. Their cheap and work fine too.  If you are already experienced with a tablet like that and want to take it to the next levelhave a lot of cash on hand a cintiq would suit you. Truthfully I dont think that there is a huge advantage to having a tablet with a screenConcerning getting ideas for your drawings the only thing I could recommend and Im sure a lot of other people would recommend is doodle. Doodling rough nonscence can actually present concepts and forms that are often usuable. The way I developed my style and am still developing it is by mixing the styles of several other artists. Whichever ones you particularly enjoy try blending them together with a flair that is all your own. Good Luck!,Yogscast,ck6n6u4,1,t5_2sg86

My suggestion is post a couple of videos in your free time and see how they are received but dont quit your job. Only make that step when you have a large following and have a fair amount of security. I dont know what stage in life you are in but even if you dont get into YouTube as a career that doesnt mean you will be working at McDonalds your whole life. Life presents opportunities for those who work for it so with enough planning and effort you can literally be anything you want to be.

I moderated a server with the Mindcrack pack and found that GT was a good way to weed out the griefers and exploiters. While you obviously will still find the dedicated griefers around it did help.However I did find that for a YT series GT is horrible no one wants to watch  episodes of grinding on a single project. So I decided to do tutorials instead. Although I was attacked relentlessly by Mindcrack fans who didnt understand the difference between Mindcrack server and Mindcrack modpack tutorial so I stopped the tutorials.All in all I wouldnt call it evil maybe misguided. I believe it has a place in extending the playability of massive servers. I still remember our first raid on the end for Iridium.

2251747,0,t3_2kzdb3,A few notes I dont think Lewis will be able to take back his city. He has naval parity now but he only has one good naval city his capital is so far away and his new city is tiny. And while the alliance has their cities far away they have many coastal cities with good production they should be able to produce and buy more boats than Lewis can.I dont know if they can pull of a land invasion but they can definitely put Lewis on the back foot take his new little city and keep being on the initiative.Another note Lewis did not get the Red Fort Rythian did. that hurts Lewis quite a bit actually.I predict the land invasion to fail but I think that the alliance will come back with a big navy and take it from the sea back up by a smaller amount of better quality units. All in all this is a victory for Duncan and Pyrion they are limiting Lewis to  cities and keeping him on the defensive. I dont see a repeat of Islands of Blood happening here.

A line like that can be interpreted as a common courtesy or being grateful for developing the game in question so clearly something is not right.At the end of the day however none of this matters because with the new ASA rules they will have to provide a proper disclosure so people like me who dont follow Yogscast specifically but search for videos on related games like in this case I was searching for Disney Infinity videos or stumble on them otherwise will no longer get confused.  ,Yogscast,cme4hz4,3,t5_2sg86

The two reasons for this are that  Im absolutely sick of the eat the shit thing that has been run into the ground within a week of Ross saying it first. Second reason is that I was looking at the Christmas livestream schedule and was disappointed by how the main duo was not nearly enough on there. I was looking forward to it for like three months in advance and didnt realize the Yogscast doesnt exist of the main duo Duncan Sips ans Sjin anymore. And seeing a lot of comments saying more Hatfilms Gmod was a bit meh. Not using a throwaway account because surely people wont misuse the downvote button in a post in which the use of the downvote button is partially explained. Also Im being completely honest instead of an asshole so I hope my useless internet points wont take a dive,Yogscast,cmf574l,8,t5_2sg86

2519273,0,t1_cmndp1e,It is unique in terms of the player character which is what I was referring to when I meant no one was safe. Part of the reason Hannah was surprised was because she was playing the character that got killed and I think that will go for a lot of people playing since the only other time Telltale did that was with Walking Dead S spoilers Lee and that was at the very end of the season. But I think the reason Telltale included it this time around was because it fits with the motif of mortality in ASOIAF.,Yogscast,cmneogt,1,t5_2sg86

2808973,0,t1_cnnc0gg,I havent seen Parvs series but from the mention of witches I assume he uses a Well of Suffering Ritual. The Well of Suffering uses a different mechanic where it generates LP for an altar from the damage it inflicts on entities in contrast to the Dagger of Sacrifice which is the fixed LP values above and oneshots nonboss mobs when close enough to the altar.Since witches are capable of healing themselves their LP generation is essentially infinite in a Well though said Wells arent exactly available to the Magic Police just yet. Im not sure if the difference between mob types applies to the Well though if it does apply Id expect villagers to still provide more at the expense of needing a method of healing or restocking them for example with BoP Spring Water or an MFR Autospawner.,Yogscast,cnnde3q,2,t5_2sg86

I can understand an official policy of removal of threads whose intent is an argument between subreddit community members but prohibiting discussion of Yogscast members interactions with other Youtube or even general internet personalities?The reasons you provide are not very convincing to be honest and you invalidate one out of the two you put forward by yourself regarding individual rule breaking comments in those threads. So your policy is that you dont take sides in arguments or movements or whatnot. Actually its not that simple is it? You removed a twitter post that was completely neutral in tone. You didnt remove the biased or side taking comments but the whole thread including any neutral or passive commentary. So your official subreddit policy is then either that you remove threads that have the potential to become biased discussions that have become biased discussions or that as is literally stated in your second point there discuss shitflining between public figures a point contradicted by your reasoning for said post in your paragraph about neutrality.Youre still not providing much clarity or reasoning here Zach.,Yogscast,co294nu,10,t5_2sg86

3059937,0,t1_cof53eo,Diplomatic is actually viable in multiplayer you just cant be passive and turtle up while gaining influence. Instead you need to be ready to defend your city states and be ready to attack a player who is trying to prevent your diplomatic win at all costs. It also means you need to be ready to put your opponents at a disadvantage through your diplomatic dominance. World ideology world religion and embargoes do a lot.I would say the lack of elements in my opinion did detract a little bit. Barbarians and City States are big parts of Civ and not having them not only made tons of Civs in the game irrelevant but it also removed big parts of the game in general. If you only watch for the interaction and the banter then I guess it makes no difference. But if you are like me and also watch it for the gameplay removal of big parts of the game does detract a bit.Also I would like to add that it is not me who is downvoting you.,Yogscast,cof5raq,3,t5_2sg86

3164248,0,t3_2wd1mv,If anything I think Id rather see games where Lewis is crazy aggressive and just starts offing people like Sjin in the team game. It would encourage people to learn how to set themselves up better for the late game. Lewis just had a little sit down and quietly built up after he took over Sjin. Id bet if he kept playing aggressive the game would have been well over by the industrial era. This style of learn by force reminds me of when some of my friends taught me how to play Starcraft. Prior to playing Starcraft I was the most passive player ever in RTS games. But I didnt get the chance to sit around and twiddle my thumbs I got rushed over and over until I finally learned to properly open and stop such attacks from utterly killing me.I really do think the yogs could do with this as opening up without building up proper science or expanding and trying to build wonders off one city will just result in these sorts of games whether or not Lewis is in them. If anything theyll take longer in which someone just gets a spaceship. Eventually people will just get frustrated that none of the players can properly fight each other.,Yogscast,copz1lx,2,t5_2sg86

3323432,0,t1_cp73kxx,ampampamp House of Leaves sfw gtgtHouse of Leaves is the debut novel by the American author Mark Z. Danielewski published by Pantheon Books The novel quickly became a bestseller following its release on March  . It was followed by a companion piece The Whalestoe Letters The novel has since been translated into a number of languages.gtThe format and structure of the novel is unconventional with unusual page layout and style making it a prime example of ergodic literature It contains copious footnotes many of which contain footnotes themselves including references to fictional books films or articles.  Some pages contain only a few words or lines of text arranged in strange ways to mirror the events in the story often creating both an agoraphobic and a claustrophobic effect. The novel is also distinctive for its multiple narrators who interact with each other throughout the story in elaborate and disorienting ways.gtWhile some have attempted to describe the book as a horror story many readers as well as the author would define the book as a love story. Danielewski expands on this point in an interview I had one woman come up to me in a bookstore and say You know everyone told me it was a horror book but when I finished it I realized that it was a love story. And shes absolutely right. In some ways genre is a marketing tool. gtgtImage iInteresting The House of Blue Leaves | Mark Z.

It took them forever to fix the trading bug. They forced you to update the game to a version that they didnt test to see completely broke multiplayer. They put very little effort into multiplayer wiki says thy had to make budget cuts and those cuts were made to multiplayer. Also the multiplayer bug where if you trade a city that needs a production it will break the game by prompting you to choose production but never letting the msg die and you cant end your turn. Never teste last one with turn timer but Im guessing you would just have to wait out every turn timer.Overall the single player is pretty good whilst the AI is poor to say the least I just cant understand their reasoning behind settling a  tiles snow island with no resources nearby.I am not arguing that it isnt fun.

Also well always disagree because Im personally tired of his constant moanings about not being allowed this that and the other for example xmas livestreams which caused drama that Lewis had to deal with group recordings which caused drama that Hannah had to deal with the blowout on this subreddit which got a lot of members angry and this which even Katie has gotten messages about.

However for that setup to be effective with your planned corner system you need to be on a version of the mod that doesnt consume the water source blocks directly.An Ender Air Bottle is obtained by right clicking with an empty bottle in The End and Gaia Spirits are obtained from a rather nasty boss that puts the Wither and most Ars Magica  bosses to shame. Your best bet would be the Angel Ring that was displayed when introducing the Flugel Tiaras since the only hard part of that is killing a Wither. If you need a safe place to summon a wither check if your version of Ender IO has Reinforced Obsidian available. Alternatively you can plant Twilight Forest saplings near the top of the Nether and bonemeal them to break through the bedrock ceiling its a strange quirk the saplings have to fight him there.Livingwood planks stairs make really nice rooftops.

4882141,0,t3_3hm240,gt A moment of silence for the real victim this episode  the friendly banterheavy atmosphere. Its all cutthroat from here on out boys.   RythianAnd sure enough there is little point to doing a Civ Banter WarSjin C  Even though all discussion has squarely ended on game related topics all around at least Sjin is having fun. Between inviting more enemy tourism influence and harassing people into onesided no aggression pacts this is the irrational kind of selfdestructive play that you think you expect from Sjin but always manages to surprise. And for lack of actual banter this will probably continue to be the highlight of this ranking until the end whilst everyone else ramps up towards war.Duncan C  God dont you hate it when people get in the way of your complaining with reasonable answers? Duncan is playing well and he wont let the other players forget this. unFortunately for us this is boosting his selfconfidence a bit too high allowing himself to sing not only the Aztek National Anthem but also providing the others with musical backing to everyones delight.Rythian C  Rythian honourably tries to bring it back trying out more French accents and Corporal Ryansonsonsonsonetc. Ryan but the bants have to make way to game at some point or another unless your name is Sips. Death spasms though they may be he does get some reaction from the guys which makes for very short respites.Zoey C  Its a hard truth for Zoey but when the conversation starts leaning towards statistics of growth and science she is really out of her element. She tries to play her little minigame of Rock Band Simulator but with only two of them in tow and only one nation crazy enough to go along with it its much like watching the youngest trying to change the rules of a game they do not understand yet.Lewis D  Science Growth Ideologies snore am I right guys??. Lewis has always said hes not supposed to be the funny man or Canadian and likes piggybacking on others humour but with Pyrion out of the game and the stakes becoming more clear it seems he has lost his main buddy to bounce off of and quickly turns all business.  Its not a bad strategy and has won him many a game but hell never get the coveted title of Master Banter this way.   I still have hope for him though maybe hell land on a comfortable first place in the next episodes and we might be able to squeeze a weird story about his dad out of him yet.General Observations  The French National Anthem La Marseillaise is actually one of the most fright and threatening songs on earth  which tells its people to water their farms with the blood of their enemies and encourages their children to sacrifice themselves using the fallen weapons of their own parents as sung by actual children France has issues man.,Yogscast,cu9xjvr,3,t5_2sg86

However TE is still a slightly technical mod in respect to the series theme.Milk being able to flow in the world is added by Minefactory Reloaded I believe. It could be quite handy as an alternative to water in the Nether as water evaporates immediately upon trying to place it. Milk on the other hand isnt affected by that water check and should instead form cobblestone or obsidian when it comes into contact with Lava. Alternatively MFR might have been clever and added its own check to turn milk buckets placed in the Nether into blocks of cheese or worse.It might not be in the packs version but there is an upgrade to the Mana Blaster called the Lens Clip attached the same way youd attach a lens which allows you to attach up to six lenses to one blaster. You can swap between the lens slots with ShiftRightClick to change modes.In regards lens colouring you may be able to tint the advanced lenses the same way you tinted that first lens  combining the Entropy Lens with a mana pearl might let you fire prismatic beams of death for example.,Yogscast,cupiy4f,5,t5_2sg86

5180512,0,t3_3lyl03,Now we have Lewiss viewpoint its easier to explain the cake is useless thing.Lets look at   Two and a half shanks worth of cakes gives a little over half a golden shank outline saturation at the right side of the bar. When regenerating health a few seconds later each half heart of health drains about half a gold shank. Once your golden shanks have depleted your hunger can start to deplete again costing half a shank per half heart. So its a good idea to max out your golden shanks as much as possible. The berry bushes Sjin uses around the  mark are excellent for this as they can be eaten when hunger is full but saturation is still lacking. This is seen at  when Sjin starts eating with full hunger and  berries remaining but stops himself. Had he continued to eat the game would stop him from eating once the saturation had filled up.In regards Immersive Engineerings Hemp I dont think the top section of the plants grow back for some reason. I dont know whether its a bug or intentional but Duncan is probably going to need to break the bottoms and replant if he wants to up production.Through witchery clay can be renewably harvested. Well... semirenewably it converts dirt into clay blocks and I suppose dirt is actually a rare commodity in Lewiss desert.

The trick is that behind the scenes it is controlled in some way there are hands on the tiller in the background AND the editing is super important and very well executed. The comic timing is just too good to be completely anarchic similar to Young Ones was.

Even the latest Yogsquest series was delayed because funding fell through and a new sponsor needed to be found.You also need to back up your reasoning behind why YogDiscovery is rubbish because otherwise we can counter with many points about why its good The Yogs have incentive to play something that isnt Minecraft reducing the risk of them getting burnt out of Minecraft and the quality of those core series dropping. The Yogs only play games they like the look of and expect to enjoy. Therell have been a lot of shit games that have tried to apply for YD but have been turned down for that reason. It would be too damaging to the brand to support an obviously bad game. When the Yogs stop covering a YD game smaller channels that are devoted to that game such as Space Engineers get a boost from viewer with continued interest in that game looking for more content. It gives small developers that cant afford a lump sum sponsor deal a chance at getting some publicity. This does not shortchange developers in any sense. Lets say that a developer shifts  copies per week avererage and the Yogs make a contract for coverage in exchange for a portion lets say  for a big easy number of the next two weeks of sales attributable to them i.e the basis of YD. Over the next four weeks the game shifts    then back to  copies each week. In reality the dropoff rate would be slower but these are some nice easy numbers.The two weeks the yogs have covered have added  and  sales so they get  of the proceeds from  units. The developer is still getting the equivalent extra sales over the two weeks plus the untouched  extra sales on week three. So for two weeks of revenue share that developer is getting an extra  weeks of revenue in that month. And thats assuming the sales rate actually goes all the way down to  again it could stabilise at  per week instead thanks to legacy viewing.,Yogscast,cxfuaed,15,t5_2sg86
5799162,0,t1_cxfaaq6,Not op but when a brandcontent creator releases exclusive content on platforms such as periscope or snapchat not everyone may have access to that content whether limited by phone choice or lack of access to a phone. Those viewers may feel like they are missing out on that exclusive content and want to view it themselves but cannot.For example periscope. I have an android phone so I cannot download the app. I may miss content from xyz. I dont want to buy an iPhone for the sole purpose of viewing content from xyz. I may now be not as inclined to watch xyzs channel because I may feel out of the loop if xyz references content from their periscope stream which I was not able to watch.Edit periscope was released on Android too. I had forgotten about that. Analogy still works for any non iosandroid device.,Yogscast,cxfxw5m,5,t5_2sg86

Its a HUGE task. Some people arent going to be happy.We should all be thankful they do this to begin with rather than nitpicking the details just because it may not be our style.

This sub is full of white knights so I know  this probably will get down voted but quite a bit was done wrong tonight. After the civ game failed they should have paid more attention to the chat. The chat voted to change the game but Duncan decided that game should be Overwatch without seeing what people wanted. You could say they can play what ever they want to but you have to understand going from civ  to Overwatch is... well crap.

6011837,0,t1_cy6t3y7,To a certain extend I agree with what Lewis and Turps are saying. I think there are a lot of useless degrees now and with the UK system making students pay  in tuition fees for an academic year its not fair for students to end up with at least k debt after getting a degree that actually might not benefit them on the job market at all in my case its a lot more than k and has a shitty starting salary as well hooray!. On top of this some top tier universities LSE etc I think have decided to charge more than this due to their elite status  which is appalling. Add to this that nursing students are under threat of having their bursaries taken away by the current government which is truly disgusting as nursing students have to basically work a full time job before they qualify unpaid and now theyre trying to strip any financial help they currently receive. I could go on and on about what a mine field higher education can be.

Someone could write People using the word retarded should be shot but they might not actually care about it at all.  We dont know the extent to which they were using hyperbole.  Maybe they were even being sarcastic and meant the exact opposite of that.  Maybe they were sitting in their chair fuming and really want to go out and shoot people over it.  But I think most often people just have an opinion state it and arent actually all that outraged or upset over it.The effect of this is that you have millions of people expressing their point of view and it can look to the reader that theres a huge pitchfork army out for the hunt.

I could coax it into responding better by lowering the rez significantly but then Im looking at a low rez image or window a quarter the size of my screen.But its very pretty.

6649904,0,t3_46qijc,Im really rooting for Rythian in this game. He really should be miles ahead of everyone if he werent so passive at the start. Imagine if hed have gotten King Solomons mines... Hed be unstoppable.Plus hes got Pyrion on one side and Duncan on the other. Hes strong tactically sound and wellprotected from the threat of Lewis.Which is why I think hes still going to lose. Lewis is ahead but being attacked from all sides. Hell struggle the rest of the game even with his ability to run a large empire and fight wars on several fronts.  Pyrion isnt likely to win unless he can get a lot more city states on his side and win a diplomatic victory.Which leaves Duncan. Lewis wont attack Duncan with nukes  hell go for the heavily defended city of Mars knowing full well that Rythian wont retaliate. If Rythian survives and continues to do well Duncan will simply attack him from the East in the end game and remove him as a threat. Duncan never accepts coming second if he can help it and Rythian simply wont be defending his border enough.  Plus Pyrion will probably decide to back Duncan in a war.Duncan to win for me which will be massively disappointing considering the great position Rythian finds himself in.,Yogscast,d075ooh,17,t5_2sg86

6815373,0,t3_492tet,Lewis A Danger approaches for Lewis. His units are starting to be picked off by triangulated bombardment from three nations. His citadels on the border are starting to fall. If anyone can survive v its Lewis but this may just be too much. On the other hand I still have him at the top of the ranking because he rules the largest most technologically advanced and powerful civ in the game and he is closer to a victory condition than any of the other civs. Lewis managed to build the Hubble Space Telescope which provides a helpful springboard towards a science victory but itll be hard to launch a spaceship under constant battleship bombardment.Rythian A Rythian continues to be the most advanced of the Southern Donut Alliance members and he is nearly a match for Lewis technologically. The Hubble Space Telescope being built by Lewis is an unfortunate break in Ethiopias wonder binge but its not the end of the world. Rythian has a mass of battleships outside Buckingham and has been steadily advancing to take Lewis citadels. He will undoubtedly prove to be the major contributor in the effort to take Austrian cities but that also likely means hell be nuke target .Duncan B Duncan continues to surprisingly be Rythians henchman in the invasion of Austria. All those episodes ago when he snatched King Solomons Mines from Rythian I saw this alliance going a different way. The bottom line is that Duncan just needs more tech. Fighting a foe from the opposite side of the donut is difficult if you dont have units that can get there quickly. Not to mention this world could descend into nuclear war very soon and the Shoshone people are illprepared to participate or even survive.Pyrion C Oh yay according to the preview we get to hear Pyrion complain about not being able to trade maps... again. The game has been out for  years get over it. Its blindingly obvious that the only reason Pyrion cares about it this much is that he is the laziest player when it comes to early exploration. However given that his aversion to scouting is well known does he really think any of the other players would be gullible enough to trade maps with him even if map trading was in the game?Sjin D  oil?? It is surprising and somewhat hilarious that the resuscitated Sjin has copious amounts of the strategic resources that every other civilization is desperate for. Arabia is the civ that gets double oil so the only thing I can think of that might be inflating Sjins numbers is if he went Autocracy and got the rd level tenet that doubles strategic resource quantity.,Yogscast,d0otj3n,159,t5_2sg86

Ill try to phrase it in a way that hopefully makes sense but let me know if I fucked up because its gonna be a fucking wall because brevity is not my strong point.I agree with the general idea of your post and applaud the discussion youve created. Im just interested in seeing your and other peoples if they can be arsed to read all this points of view regarding some of your comments about the subreddit. Please keep in mind while I am a moderator here I dont speak for all moderators. This is part of why I havent distinguished this comment my name isnt green.gtThis stuff with Kim happened before with Simon. Cast your mind back to years ago shortly before Simons hiatus. Just about every reddit thread most youtube comments and other feedback platforms were full of complaints about Simon about his constant screaming the fact that Lewis is the brains and Simon is the comedic relief. Constant unrelenting and blunt criticisms not only about the content of their videos but about them as people. About their personas how they hold themselves their viewpoints and mannerisms. This has to stop.Im wondering what you think constitutes breaking Rule . This only applies to the Reddit comments  ignore the TwitterYT ones because theres nothing the reasonable people that agree with you here can do about them.Rule  for your convenience Do not post baseless negative comments about any usersPlease do not flame or troll or otherwise leave disparaging remarks about users or the Yogscast. Constructive criticism is welcome but keep it reasonable and respectful. Dissenting opinions are welcome and so is heated discussionlanguage. Offending posts will be removed and bans will be issued for repeat offenders.The examples youve put above I wouldnt remove  as long as it was clear that they were criticizing his persona on videos. It may be blunt but I dont think its rude enough to warrant us removing those comments. So when you say this has to stop  would you like Rule  to be sharpened or would you rather not have people make their... lessthanpositive comments? Because I think people care too much about the Yogs to give up on constructive criticism altogether and just hugboxyesman them.gtRegarding the Simon vs TB drama I watched as we brought down a great person. Someone who was cynical but could find joy in anything jokes about any topic and relief in any situation. We brought him down.I dont think we had anything to do with bringing him down. He made those tweets he attacked and provoked a former friends person not persona first. Yes it was a silly insult one that wouldntve spawned a reddit thread if said in a video or said to an actual friend  but TB wasnt a friend anymore then. I honestly believe Simon couldve called TB any kind of name from really silly to really awful  and the backlash wouldve been about the same. This is the thing that many of the Yogs dont seem to be able to grasp either. Tone and intention are gone when you write them on the internet. It wasnt the contents of his comment  it was the fact it was a direct seemingly unprovoked attack on TBs person. I honestly think its quite hypocritical of you to include this example in a thread about not attacking other people via the internet for no constructive reason  but just commenting to vent or provokeanger them. I hope I explained this well and you can see the irony.gtThe next time you see a comment about Duncan is a nerd Pyrion is an idiot which seem to be the new general direction of the hivemind IMO downvote it to oblivion. That sort of criticism offers no help and merely acts to spite them.Small change  if you see a comment that you feel breaks Rule  please report it instead using the report button underneath that comment. The moderators will take care of it if its just xyz is an idiot i.e. unconstructive and downright rude shit.gtTLDR Stop being cunts beepSomething we can all agree on !,Yogscast,d1sq204,24,t5_2sg86

The only real issue in my opinion is if there are underage people involved.gtAdults dont use tumblr.This kind of highlights the concern funnily enough.  If these people involved are not adults then they should not be ignored.  Im not saying the entire internet needs to get involved but I hope they receive support and are able to talk to friends about whatever difficult time they felt they had and are encouraged to go to the authorities if its appropriate.I dont think Lewis or Turps need to be held responsible for a coworkers actions.  Calling on them to fire Sjin is unhelpful especially if no wrongdoing has occurred since then.  As Turps said very well in the livestream if something is wrong PLEASE go to the appropriate authorities.  Lewis and Turps are just guys who are hearing a whole lot of stuff from both sides and have no proof of anything.  If there are legal issues the authorities need to be the ones to take care of it.  If there arent then people can be mad on their own time and talk to their friends to work it out of their system if they need to but theres no need to drag other members of the Yogscast into it who have absolutely nothing to do with Sjins personal relationships with other people.,Yogscast,d2369kw,81,t5_2sg86

Youd think a sexual predator who puts his personality on youtube day after day would come off as a sexual predator. Sjin is just a stand up guy.I would have been inclined to believe Minty being a yogscast employee and his ex girlfriend but for some reason she starts drumming this up after leaving. Id also think shed know about any unsavoryillegal habits and activities of his due to dating him for a pretty good chunk of time.

That being said at some point in my life I said to myself I dont need animated movies in my life.  Japan didnt get the memo and started making more adult animated media.  Which is fine but theres also a cut off.  People who grew up during older Disney animation sans Sjin and before anime took off in the west just dont care about animated movies nearly as much as people who grew up with them.  People who grew up on anime are still in that mindset that gets them excited to see more.Basically it comes down to this  If you reached a mature enough age before Pokemon got popular in western culture you made the cut off.

Hell even Lewis said in this ep that someone had to keep the story going and it seems that him and Duncan and Simon at least are trying. And theyre entertaining enough on their own. Sips and Sjin though? I dont know why theyre included in these series because when theyre together they just screw around and break things. And I think Tom or whoever was playing Sly Tony was making a point by destroying their stuff in the lava because theyre probably getting as fed up with it as I am. And its not like theres a little bit of plot  theres actually been a hell of a lot of plot. They start on sky whale they get abandoned by their captain they have to figure out where theyre going talk to traders have encounters with people on the skylands theyre flying near and now theyve landed near a haunted abandoned dwarfhold that had some connection with the Honeydew clan because their whale is sick andor dying they accidentally released an ancient evil there they explored a nearby island and got told by a mob boss there that they had go back up to the clouds to feed the whale to help it a chamber with demon armour and reflections suddenly appeared on their sick whale and now they have to go inside it to assassinate someone.

I know it is a very crude concept but something like a player being on a remote destination with a lot of gold and good trading infrastructure to begin with surely this can be modded in would add a new debth to the civ games.

You could of course do it to test the waters but I dont think youll get much out of it. They usually like to plan out the entire series and the events thats going to happen in it like the incase of Whale Lords or the whole idea of building a Jaffa factory in the Jaffa factory series. And I think they still have a team of builders and modders that help them at least they used to. But they have a team of builders for sure. But I do really hope for you that he gives a good response but tbh their Minecraft gold age is probably over. If not their channels gold age but they still make great content never the less.

Adventure maps often had poor views in comparison to other content. People were more interested in YogsOriginal stories. Diamonds in the Rough is very unlikely to come back as Nilesy left Youtube for Twitch in addition to the above. Race for the Wool takes a lot of schedule shuffling to get all the creators together at the same time. This sort of thing works best on the Christmas Livestreams. Yoglabs will return ifwhen the Yogs find new mods that both interest them and they understand. Most ongoing modded series are on . versions of Minecraft whilst the modding community has moved on to .. As such the yogs are unlikely to encounter new and interesting mods until their modded series catch up to .. Israphel is officially cancelled.

9067316,0,t3_54fbh9,Game crashing intensifiesDuncan A Duncan has put his strong start to use by being the first out of the gate with a second city. He may not be expanding at the rate of AI Hiawatha but hes setting a good pace. I generally find The Iroquois play best as a wide empire with lots of cities though I think we saw him choose Tradition which means hell likely follow the standard  city strategy. Duncan is also being careful. Hes escorting units and scouting well. His neighbours arent too close so he should be able to secure a decent section of the continent for his rattlesnakewielding people. Pyrion B B for Bodega. Seeing Pyrions naming scheme I can imagine what his religion will be based on if he gets one. The borders of Murica are expanding at a snails pace right now but at least hes planning expansion. To claim land he may want to boost his culture or take advantage of his civs cheap tile purchases. Pyrions biggest challenge as always will be to keep his tech on pace with the Lewises and Duncans of the world. If he falls behind hell never get to use Americas unique units. Also hed never get to building super mines and space farms.Lewis B Lewis start is appearing better now that we can see the gold mines to his north. Hes also working on his second city  which is a good idea due to the proximity of Ben and the neutral sheep zone. He may end up expanding northwards since he probably fears retaliation from Rythian less than from Ben. Lewis did lose a unit to barbarians this episode though he still has a couple units out scouting. The borders of Gao are also growing nicely. Like everyone else I expect Lewis to soon be spreading over the map and in a strong position. Its a rare Civ game when hes not a contender. Ben B Oh King Solomons Mines thats a great natural wond annnnd a citystate has it. Ben is planning a second city regardless and is fending off the prying eyes of the Songhai. As others have probably pointed out there arent any dud huts  usually when you dont see anything youve gotten culture as in this case. Ben seems like he might be right in the middle of the map so hell want to stay welldefended this game. It seems likely there will be conflict with Lewis at some point and if Rythian is roleplaying as Denmark things could get ugly. Rythian C Rythian is continuing to stoke the flames of Danish nationalism. I actually hope for a war between him and Ben just for the insight he could give. Im a little concerned about this Great Library rush strategy though  all the other players are undertaking expansion at this point and theres limited land. I was genuinely surprised at Rythians question about chopping forests  it seems crazy that the situation would have never come up before. Luxuries or other resources for that matter dont just disappear no matter what you do to the tile. Theres actually no reason not to cut down that particular forest because its on plains. The yield will be the same either way. You can even build a camp and then chop down the forest and the improvement will stay despite a warning popup saying otherwise.Sjin D What Pyrion said. Notes Steve Irwin died more than  years ago now. Why do they still always ask if a city is a real place? In this episode the target was Genoa. Why would there be a notreal city in the game? What mystical civilizations are part of the game? I hope we see the PyrionasaDalek impression again that was great.

9199427,0,t1_d8i0aki,People are such babies. Even if they were ganging up on Lewis hes still going to win because they should have attacked ages ago when Rythian first wanted to. Now Lewis has artillery and can not be stopped. Plus its a v. Though I fully expect Pyrion to try and let the war weaken Lewis as much as possible while strengthening his own position with newly conquered Danish cities and then inevitably betraying his toopowerful ally. Indeed Duncan is turtleing for science victory but in a way that just raises the stakes by putting a timer on the game. Lewis is the immediate threat but wait too long and Duncan will launch a spaceship. And then you have Sjin with decent science and a solid little nation who is a total wildcard. This is main reason its impossible to predict whos going to win this game and thats what makes it so good. We expect Lewis to fight tooth and nail for first place and we expect Rythian and Ben to try and take him down. We can expect Duncan to turtle to science victory and Pyrion to manipulate allies and enemies and the world congress to put himself in the most favourable position and any of those strategies could work... or not. Sjin could tip the balance in anyones favour or else throw a stick into their machinations. Because its impossible to predict what he plans to do probably because he has no plans this game is still everyones to win.,Yogscast,d8i3foq,28,t5_2sg86

A few closest to him fell in wonder their hearts stopping. Others where later taken away by masked men never to be seen again.  Across the river unknown to all but the King Ben looked in amusement. Standing upon the roof of the encampment he had a clear view of the fledgling works. Beneath him the men were just beginning to wake up he could hear the captains shouting orders and the first of the soldiers making their way towards the river. They did not know he was there he had sneaked into the base during the night passing right by the guards. He did not fault them however he had not been seen for hundred years unless he wanted to.So Lewis. You think that will stop me? he looked down at the object in his hand an old coin with a single D inlaid into it. He smiled at the memory. Will your new pets fight as hard as they did? Babylon is gone now. But history always repeats itself.He turned away from Lewis gliding down the side of the encampment building and onto the floor right behind the guardsman. Solider! Stand to attention! he whispered. He smiled as the soldiers training kicked in it was only a second before the blade was at his throat and only another before it was dropped to his side.My Liege! the soldier cried in horror almost stabbing himself in the leg as he dropped to his knee. Around him Ben heard the rest of the camp do the same in a wave as his presence was revealed slowly to the camp.As his men dropped Ben glanced over the river towards the Brazilian Lord. Lewis sensing something looked around frantically before seeing the other. The two stared over the river at one another before Ben mouthed three words at his opponent.See you soonInterludeIt was midday before the boys ran within earshot of the workers and then it was at the edge of the forest. The woodsman expecting an earlier rainy season had decided to begin felling trees for wood when he heard the yelling of the boys. However at first he thought nothing of it. Probably just them playing. It was not until he heard the drums that he thought something was wrong. He stopped for a moment thinking it was the thunder getting louder until he realised the beats. Like the instruments that the traders bring once a year. But not the same. Somehow more menacing. He moved to the road axe in hand towards the sound. As the sound got louder so too did the shouts. Soon it was not just boys. He began to run. The smell of smoke in the air. He could hear screaming children. The smell of burning wood. He could hear clashing metal.  He burst free of the trees. SjinEmperor I bring news!You have caught up to the builders? Sjin asked his soft voice betraying no emotion. His eyes seemed fixed on some point over the horizon he leant gracefully upon the balcony his body turned at one side like a painting of some beautiful lady upon her gallery. The messenger who had only got the briefest glimpse of his lord still wept as he spoke his eyes streaming his mind a fog of emotion.My Lord. Please forgive me. I was unaware you were occupied the messenger said in a low voice as he began to back out of the room.Nonsense my child! Sjin bounced across the room towards the messenger dimming his radiance as he did so enabling him to touch the mortal body of the messenger. He placed a single hand upon the messengers head causing the mans body to collapse. His muscles simply giving in.My Lord. It is not the builders. The messenger spoke into the floor his body unresponsive to his commands They have been captured by the Brazilians and put to workWell Sjins soft voice responded That is not bad news. I have no use for traitors. But what news do you have?It took the messenger almost a minute to respond his brain shutting down momentarily. When he returned to consciousness Sjin had moved back to the balcony.It is the Russian Tsar my lord. The messenger began to speak quickly whilst moving slowly towards the door wanting to finish his message before he collapsed again He has declared Antwerp a danger to his lands. He demands it for himself.Sjin sighed. It was a sigh that almost knocked the man over once more this time in exhaustion.Thank you for telling me. Sjin said to the man. He looked over at the man as a small breeze blew through the open window blowing what was left of the man away scattering his dust to the wind.TomKaiser Tom stood upon the ashes of the village. His mere presence causing what was left of the surrounding land into flames. He looked at his troops as knelt. Awaiting his order. The only one looking was the captain. Awaiting his command. But Tom did not speak. He simply raised a single fiery hand and pointed Westward. DuncanIn Arthur Dent Pharaoh Duncan wept. Memories of forgotten times rushed through his mind once more.The chocolate wars had begun,Yogscast,dakt1tf,25,t5_2sg86

Theyre valuable in a skyblock as a means of procuring large amounts of dirt but have a poisonous aura when active which can be dangerous if your skyblock is too small. In your worldgen type they are much less valuable due to the plentiful dirt and the nonvoid Nether.You have also previously used them on Sjins Farm and I think on Agrarian Skies though the latter might have been DW.Botania Enchanting is very similar to the Vanilla Anvil  combining enchanted books with toolsarmour. The difference is Botania Enchanting doesnt consume the book and I think it only uses Mana rather than taking player levels.You wont be able to escape the lag of that factory until Lewis adopts AE or LogiPipes.

They have also called on the army to depose the current administration if the elections do not go ahead. Meanwhile Mr Brindleys junior coalition partners the REX party hailed the move stating that its whats best for the Belgian people.

11469344,0,t3_63p7rq,There isnt really a fully narrated universe. Some series are fully connected some are slighty connected some just hint at others and some are standalone.Shadow of Israphel is the most famous Yogscast series and the reason they became popular. It is a roleplaying adventure story with Lewis and Simon. Unfortunately it ended on a cliffhanger but it is an important series to watch even if you just watch it for the references to it later on. It consists of three seasons and is fully standalone from all other minecraft series.After that the Yogs started their Modded Minecraft series. These dozens of series are all somewhat often very loosely connected. Most series have little story with only occasionally some roleplaying but some go quite deep into RP Rythians series or DuncanKims GalacticraftFluxbuddies series.They started with Tekkit. This was the first pack and most of the Yogs played on it. Duncans lab is the important starter series as it provides a background for the series in the first  episodes. After those  you can keep watching or switch to Jaffa Factory or Sipsco Dirt Factory the two most important series on that server. Duncans lab is nice to watch as a tutorial and Blackrock Chronicles by Rythian is a good RP series but neither is necessary. More series were recorded and you can find all of them on the wiki under Tekkit and Yogcraft.Eventually Tekkit became unstable and they copied the world to a new pack Yogcraft. This move took a while so they played Voltz in the meantime. The main channels Voltz and SipsSjins Voltz with Sips and Sjin are rather short series and definitely worth a watch.After the move they continued their old series until everything broke down and then started on new packs on new servers. It get quite complicated at that point. The main series continued with MoonQuest which competed with Sips and Sjins Sipsco Space Program. MoonQuest turned into MarsQuest JaffaQuest and continued with Hole Diggers. Hole Digger was the last of the original Modded Minecraft series.After that its mostly just unconnected questbook packs. There are dozens of other series on various Yogscast channels during this entire time but Ive mentioned all the important ones I think.Some other series of note are Trials of Derpulies and Trials of Skobbels where multiple teams of Yogs compete in a sort of gameshow like environment. Whale Lords is a relatively recent series that tried to be somewhere inbetween SOI Tekkit a skyblock and an adventure map and was well liked by the community.Completely separated from the Modded Minecraft and SOI series is Yoglabs. These are oneoff Mythbusters like episodes where Lewis tests various mods with the help of Simon. It is an almost fully RP series with a loosely connected story between the episodes.TLDRShadow of Israphel universe SOI Season Modded Minecraft Universe Duncans lab episode   Jaffa Factory  Sipsco Dirt Factory  Rest of Duncans Lab Optionally Blackrock Chronicles Optionally Various other series Optionally Voltz Inbetween series Voltz with Sips and Sjin Inbetween series MoonQuestMarsQuestJaffaQuest  Sipsco Space Program  Holediggers Unconnected series Yoglabs Trials of Derpulies  Trials of Skobbels  Whale Lords,Yogscast,dfw1lvk,17,t5_2sg86

I loved the video but I think the ASA has ruled that it must be clear a sponsored video is a sponsored video before consumer engagement or something along those lines.

11627195,0,t3_65xlgg,Some context since a lot happens Headmassif the last man standing and Cynni guy who got downed were the last  left in the stack. In the beginning of the clip you can see on the ridge to the right theres  people who Headmassif downs. You can see him downing and killing them to the right of Pyrions webcam which is blocking the majority of the kill feed. Sips calls out their forth who is coming towards Cynni. Cynni runs away from the blue because at this stage in the game it does a lot of damage quite fast. He got downed by the guy sips called out as Headmassif comes around and swaps to his shotgun to kill the last man standing seconds before he Headmassif wouldve been killed by the blue.,Yogscast,dgdydw2,10,t5_2sg86
