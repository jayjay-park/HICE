6460007,0,t3_443h81, If the opponent is close enough an uncharged Neutral Special can be followed up with the fullycharged Neutral Bite. Deals around  if I remember correctly. Down Special is incredibly good. I just countered a Kirbys Down Special on  Coliseum at  and it killed him off the top from ground level. Very good option if you want to mix up on approaching an airborne opponent. Remember that like all counters you shouldnt pull it out too often. Its very early in the game so most people dont know that Fsmash has a hitbox while charging up. Im sure people are starting to learn but for now it can catch new players off guard. I dont know how to do it reliably but a sloweddown Dair makes it easier to get all of the hits. If theres a way to assure this please let me know. On the topic of Dair you can use it to carry enemies down to the blast zone. I recommend not doing this as  It more often than not promises death for you and  When the attack ends if the opponent has good recovery they can still return to the stage. I have yet to try and see what happens when you carry them all the way to the blast zone will try that when I get home tonight. Landing Side Special in the stage instead of going to ledge or waiting around is another great option. Be wary of enemies charging up longerreaching attacks though as you are still vulnerable. Attacking forward can catch them off guard cancelling lets you go to ledge and attacking back or jumping is useful to dodge an incoming attack. Up Special can deal around  if you carry the enemy all the way and has pretty nice knockback. Recovering with it is a tad bit odd though. If you want to go straight up hold the reverse direction that your character is facing. Try not to do it too soon though or else you might just Breverse it and go flying the other direction. Just a quick note that I believe you have to land Side Specials hitbox into an opponent and the ground in order to trap them. Unsure if theres a way to land both the tip into the enemy and the ground dealing  along with followup but the possibility of it could spell for major damage.,CorrinMains,czniaj1,1,t5_3bcn3
