1484425,0,t1_cj2cd4m, Well. Goodbye everybody. I had a great game with you all and its a shame to end it this way. Duncan rose his head one last time. He looked up. His bones were shattered and his hands were bleeding. His vision blurred out and blurred back in slowly and his ears rang with the impact. He nodded softly as footsteps fell around him lowering his head seemingly surrendered. One hand went up. One final joker began to fall from the sky. He forged a sword high in the air large enough to cast a shadow over the island and watched as it fell down from orbit. How much did it weigh? He wondered as the shadow grew slowly in the sky. He closed his eyes and began to count. He thought he knew the impact depth of the dead hand but he just wanted to be sure. How fast can Hannah fly anyway?,userbattles,cj2cjht,4,t5_2xtfr

His pistol shot was made of the same metals and would not perform any better. How to kill a creature to which poison is worthless? There was fire on the robot. Steam was whistling slowly. Steam. The student backed off and thrust a wine casket from a nearby stall at the creature. The robot shuddered. If there was any damage it was not enough to destroy it. ,userbattles,co0iis2,3,t5_2xtfr
