70551,0,t3_1uw8hx,Im surprised that nobody mentioned the most obvious answer buy your own columns. We buy these columns in packs of  and make all the reagents ourselves. In addition to the lab standard reagents it only requires purchasing guanidine hydrochloride and guanidine thiocyanate which are somewhat expensive but a single bottle goes a long way. It doesnt take long to make these reagents and the purifications are just as good as the overpriced Qiagen stuff. Ive used the columns and labmade reagents to purify libraries for highthroughput sequencing where purity is key over  times without any problems whatsoever. Also if we need higher yields for plasmids we generally just grow larger cultures perform alkaline lysis isopropanol precipitation RNaseProteinase K treatment then phenolchloroform then ethanol precipitation. I dont know if the DNA is pure enough for things like transfection but it definitely gives you boatloads of DNA I routinely get about  micrograms though it depends on the size per mL of culture.,labrats,cemgm1n,8,t5_2srnv

1506734,0,t3_2bfkan,I think trying another labs LB is definitely a good idea.  What kind of vessel do you grow the  mL culture in?  I ask because it can be a lot easier to contaminate a large flask than a capped culture tube and in a walkin  there might be plenty of potential contaminants floating around ruining all of the care you put into sterilizing everything else.  A check for this would be to incubate sterile media with no bacteria added in both  mL and  mL volumes just as you do when bacteria are added and see if anything grows.  If you get any growth you know theres contamination and if its only in the  mL culture you know  that its likely related to the size of the flask.  You could then try splitting it into smaller volumes and see if that helps a  mL culture can get pretty decent aeration right in a closed   mL conical tube if tilted in the incubator. Thats all I can think of on the contamination front that could be different than what others have suggested.  But there are a lot of great suggestions and sometimes Science is just kind of a jerk.  Odds are it will work when you get back from vacation without changing anything.,labrats,cj5573z,1,t5_2srnv

1557576,0,t3_2c0cql,Background I have a BA in molecular biology and did a year medical technologist program after my bachelors. I went on to work in research labs exclusively and have been a career tech for nearly  years with an eye to working my way up to staff scientist in my current lab within the next two years. Your year technician program will as others mentioned give you excellent basic lab skills and will acclimate you to a clinical lab environment. It may also give you access to research labs depending on the kind of department your program is in. Doing a year degree before a bachelors degree gives you the option of working in a decentpaying job and gaining valuable lab experience while you go to school. From talking to friends who did similar tracks it sounds preferable to working at Starbucks while you work on your bachelors which is what I did.But before you commit to a specific educational route get going in your tech program and see if you like it.  of the students in my med tech program dropped out because it didnt suit them. You may spend a few weeks or months training for lab work and discover that you hate it.If you discover you dont hate it use it as an opportunity to learn about different jobs available in healthcare and lab sciences by making contacts in your department and requesting to observe procedures outside your program. If youre affiliated with a hospital request to see say surgical procedures if youre thinking about going into a surgical PA. Request to spend a few hours a week in the emergency department if youre thinking about emergency medicine etc. I requested a two week rotation in a research lab and ended up getting hired into that lab when I was finished with my med tech degree. I happen to love benchwork so I didnt pursue further school. Try on different departments and different roles and see what grabs you. ,labrats,cjbiklr,2,t5_2srnv

1666419,0,t3_2dfscv,The first MS pass is a selection process. The instrument looks for precursor masses which fit given criteria fragments that peptide and then sends it to the second MS stage which will have higher resolution since the mass now of the analyte is significantly less.So the first stage is used for selection. As far as I understand you could do a single pass on fragmented peptides but you would primarily end up with a lot of junk without this first selection. On the flipside sometimes you have a rich sample you want to select though then on top of MSMS you would put some chromatography in front to further spreadout when different species would enter the Mass Spec.Also I think you statement suggested that the MSMS most be trypsindigested. While the general practice is trypsindigest as its fairly predictable you do not have to use such a digest and likewise using multiple digests can be a means to provide greater insight into the polypeptide species being studied.,labrats,cjp7pm3,3,t5_2srnv

4674528,0,t1_ctj8v80,Not to sound belittling here because its awesome that you are getting to do that stuff in high school but you are only getting a tiny glimpse into the world of molecular bio. If you are interested in the field I highly encourage you to do undergraduate research for it if you can when you go to college of course. You may end up loving it or hating it.. I personally love it.. creating my own expression vectors with custom sequences and utilizing them in gene therapy studies well after bacterial transformation can be insanely tedious and frustrating but so worth it in the end.And to address your ELISA questions what volume are you wanting to work with? Its a good idea but unless you are working with microfluidic channels it wont be a very practical application. well plates are pretty ideal in terms of well volume. The lower volume you go the more money you need to drop on pipettes to ensure volume accuracy. There are other types of ELISA than sandwich. Check those out if they apply to testing the conc of the specific antigen youre referring to. If you need pinpoint accuracy which a sandwich ELISA can accomplish stick with your plan. Otherwise go for something simpler because it will leave less of a hole in your wallet. Here is a typical protocol See protocol above. Since youre working with a smaller volume youll have to scale it down. If you need help scaling it down I could help out but youll have to provide details on your custom plate.Also testing whether or not the antigens or conjugates are binding to your antibodies you really just have to do a trial run of the entire thing and see if it works in the end.  You are going to want to develop your own standard curve. So once you get this going you will want to add known concentrations of antigen to different wells. ELISA kits have concentration ranges some only detect up to  ng so you will want to test a ton of different concentrations and have tons and tons of data to build your standard curve. Once you do this and colors develop in the wells you could take a highquality photo of the wells from the top down  assuming these wells are clear and you can put a white background beneath them. From there you could open the image in Photoshop or other editors and measure the color intensity saturation.. The concentration will correspond to the saturation and vice versa. Im sure there is an app that does what I just explained above but that is how I would go about it if I were to do it manually.One last thing you may not be aware of is that most ELISA kits come with  well plates that allows the user to remove columns so if you dont have many samples to test you could take  columns out of the plate and only work with the  wells of a single column. This is a super helpful feature and it saves time and lots of money on reagents.If you have any other questions feel free to ask away. I do ELISA on a weekly basis so all of these techniques are ingrained in me.,labrats,ctjrwkz,2,t5_2srnv

4685793,0,t3_3f3t5f,Fact theyre tougher than you think.  Dont be afraid to use a little leverage.First you want the animal calm.  I usually hold the little guy on my forearm for a few minutes while I prepare whatever Im working on.  Other times Ill drop them into a lab coat pocket.  They actually purrvibrate when theyre comfortable with you.Two options to try.  The first is to set them on a counter or hard surface and hold the base of their tail in your nondominant hand index finger and thumb OR middle fingerindex finger.  Press the side of your hand pinkie against the scapula and place enough force to pin the animals upper body down.   Im average height and male and my hands are big enough to do this.  The rear legs are usually off the ground slight hyperextension in the spine but completely safe.  Now pin the animals rear leg with your index finger or middle finger whichever isnt gripping the tail.  So if Im holding the animal with my left hand and injecting their right side Id pin their ankle between my index and middle finger.  Animal pinned leg pinned IP area clean organs ventral and towards the head.Option two is to put a heavy oven mitt or sock in front of them.  Theyll crawl in and their butt is exposed.  Pin using my method above and theyre a bit more swaddledunruly.In either scenario you get one good chance before they get antsy.  Take charge be firm  and dont inject too deep.,labrats,ctl6tv4,2,t5_2srnv

4877190,0,t3_3hothn,I work second shift pmpm or so and I love it for the most part. Granted I work in industry so this is my actual shift and its a large company not a smaller lab environment though the lab Im in is small itself me and a few other technicians.I am not much of a morning person so I do my best work in the evenings anyway. I get up at around am or am and I have a nice relaxing breakfast spend some time with my dogs go for a swim andor workout at they gym run any errands I need to and shower all before going to work. When I arrive at work Im not drowsy or sluggish because Ive been awake for  hours already. I eat my lunch at around pm and I leave around midnight usually. Driving home there is no traffic and its nice and cool outside not  degrees like at pm when st shift leaves. I get home eat dinner have a beer maybe watch a show depending how tired I am and then go to bed.I personally love not feeling rushed to get to work in the morning and also being able to work outrun errandsetc during the day before work rather than at night when Im already tired. The big drawback is that I have no social life during the week. When I wake up most people are already at work and by the time I get home everyone is already asleep for the most part. It can get lonely. However that is pretty much the only significant negative I can think of and I still get to hang out like normal on the weekends anyway so its not so bad.I love working second shift but I can see how it might not be easy to pull off in a smaller academic laboratory environment. When I worked in a lab at a university I was doing what you did coming in after am and staying later than everyone else. In many ways I was also doing it for similar reasons as you. My PI didnt like it very much I think because I seemed lazy by coming in so much later than everyone else. She also encouraged collaboration and interdependent relationships between the members of the lab on their projects and since I was working a schedule that was off from everyone elses I seemed absent a lot. In hindsight i should have been more proactive about talking to my PI about what I was doing and why and see if she would be more accommodating of my schedule than what I assumed she might be.I say you should go for it if you are serious about making the switch. Get a solid list of reasons why you  think working different hours would benefit you and your work as well as benefitting or at least not disrupting the rest of the lab and sit down with your PI to discuss it. ,labrats,cu9b37c,5,t5_2srnv
4952113,0,t3_3ilqwr,I can understand that  hrsweek could be challenging depending on your course load.  The PI is demanding and this lab might not be for you unless you can pare down your course load.  Most of my undergraduates only did  hrsweek and as a result I preferred that they stay for  years or else all Im doing is training and then waving them goodbye.  While this lab may be an awesome opportunity you can probably find another lab that would be ok with fewer hours.  Whether you get a publication out of undergraduate research is a crapshoot anyway and its almost always just tagging along on a grad students paper as a middle author anyway.  On average it takes at least  year of fulltime research often much more to put out a journal article.  ,labrats,cuir5d0,1,t5_2srnv

7553322,0,t1_d2ytc3q,Its definitely possible that your qPCR reactions are being randomly inhibited by something.  I run a lot of colony qPCR where we have whole cells as template and those need to be adequately diluted out to not inhibit the reaction  which is more sensitive than a regular PCR to this sorta stuff SYBR Green is already a bit inhibitory to the polymerase by itself I guess adding anything on top of that makes it worse.  So thats why you should take a step back and do some fundamental troubleshooting.  Work with some nice pure DNA where you know you dont have this problem.  Just dilute it out and make sure youre reliably getting the same Ct with different dilutions in replicates.  Then you would know that its not your pipetting its not your instrument or software  its the sample thats the problem.As for your cDNA yield I dont think Ive ever calculated a yield for the reaction because I never cleaned it up afterwards.  Im not sure why you would do it since you can go immediately to qPCR with most commercial cDNA kits  the RNA cant amplify and you usually kill the polymerase with a high temp incubation if I recall correctly.  I might have used RNAse H or something like that once afterwards depending on the kit.  I always checked that I had no DNA in my RNA by PCR and then checked that I had cDNA after the first strand synthesis again this time looking for a band by PCR. You just have to make an assumption that your RNA is at least being reproducibly amplified back to cDNA and that the different cDNA product ratios are representative of the RNA population and thats all you can do.,labrats,d30rz1q,1,t5_2srnv

One of the labs that I called wanted a per barrel quote for disposal of flammable waste. In order to give a lockedin quote we needed to know the exact contents of the barrel. Flammable lab cats. Wut?!? So it turns out that after the cats lives were over they went into a barrel of alcohol to keep them from decomposing while the lab figured out what to do with them. Regular flammables like paint thinner and alcohol get used as fuel to fire cement kilns but if they have any biological components like cats they instead have to be incinerated in a process involving higher temps and the ash has to be disposed of in a hazardous waste landfill. If I recall correctly they ended up costing upwards of  to dispose of per barrel versus about  per barrel for regular flammables.,labrats,d4gw6v4,10,t5_2srnv

This is probably your best option.If you dont have time for more benchwork then just focus on writing up the results at hand.  If the data from your experiment do not answer the thesis at hand then what do they answer?  Why were those experiments carried out?  Do they produce the same results as previously or is there deviation that you can address?  Even if the data has been presented before it would be worthwhile to write it up anyway and present it in the context of your specific hypothesis.  It may also be a good idea to point out the holes that are present in your projectjust dont call them holes necessarily.  Rather talk about what questions havent been answered and what methods or experiments would be required to answer them.I would talk to the second reviewer and explain to himher your situation that your advisor did not think it necessary to carry out additional experiments and therefore you did not have clearance to do so.  From personal experience professors are far more understanding about stuff like this than what Ive expected.In the future it may be worthwhile to be more insistent whenever you think a projectexperiment needs to be redesigned you may risk coming off pushy but thats another discussion I get that its always tough as an undergrad to balance the line between being assertive and coming off as presumptuous.  Try more than once and make sure you have solid reasoning to back up your claims.

Viral infection is different in that the viruses are going to infect somewhat stochastically.

8349430,0,t1_d5jomse,Well here is the one I use I see that basically is the same with maybe minor differences.  We use lower ODs when it comes to genomic integrations increasing volume of culture to compensate. Also use increased amounts of buffers in general.If I had to think of something else I would recheck the homology of the arms in your construction to make sure that at least  bp are homolog. Also think about the quality of the oligos you are using for PCR. For genomic integration those are usually very long and most of the time we use HPLC or PAGE purified oligos to avoid the ones with wrong bases but I reckon even using normal desalted oligos should work.For the amounts of PCR we normally do the PCR in  ul using proofreading polymerase using  ul for checking the reaction and the rest for the transformation.

So if you can have some sort of containment I would go for that. Also  ethanol isnt stringent enough. It wont kill mycoplasma really and thats small and subtle enough it could fuck you up down the line. We use Biocidal and VirkonS for decon and I would recommend these if your set up allows for it Biocidal is water based and VirkonS is acidic and will definitely cause rusting if not wiped down thoroughly so watch out for that.Anyway the set up I use is actually a scope in the hood positioned so that the flow is over the cells but the eyepieces are outside with the sash lifted up all the way and I wear a mask to keep from breathing on it.So I guess my advice would be to use some sort of containment wear a mask and have really good disinfectant.

The truth is they work fine youll get results with all . Buuuuuuuut CID is now worse than HCD because you dont get such nice fragment spectra out of CID data so youll get fewer or less confident peptide IDs. And ETD is kinda on a par with HCD buuuuuuuuuut if youre doing phosphoproteomics you will get a different answer when you use HCD vs ETD maybe not conflicting answers but youll definitely learn the most by doing both and then comparing them. Everyone in proteomics will try to convince you that THEIR method is the best the most logical etc... you just need to figure out what works for you and your samples and then stick to it. ,labrats,d7fe5ap,2,t5_2srnv

9032895,0,t1_d7x15k2,I think what you should get into the mindset as a tech work is at work and home is for home. You dont want to become expected to work  hours a week and then get scolded for not doing more especially if youre not being paid for it. Dont fall into the trap of rationalizing PI logic sometimes it can be...wonky. As others put it the reward for taking on work is more work and once you start it will become expected.  gtI am technically there  hours a week but I suppose Im not productive every minute of the day.No adult is expected to be able to be completely engaged for  hours a day  hours a week but you make efficient use of the time spent at work.  So for example if youre being paid for  hours of work then be at work for  hours and work hard during those hours. Because its science its not always that clean and you might have to drop by the lab real quick to finish up an experiment then do so. This is extremely relevant because youre being paid hourly with no benefits. The conditions your PI is expecting of you is of a OTexempted salaried employee who is required to have benefits paid out to them which benefits usually run an additional third or more of the employees gross salary.  gtIf its normal to work this amount as a Ph.D. student or postdoc then I am more willing to continue to do the work I am doing in hopes that it will help train me to be a better scientist. Would you say this is true?  Generally yes but there will come a point of diminishing returns the longer you stay the tech in that lab. Youll have to evaluate whether youve hit the skill ceiling for techniques and what you can learn from your lab experience. If youre still learning thats good if youre churning ideas then keep on. Just periodically evaluate your options.  Also youll have to make sure youre still okay staying in that lab or be better off in another lab.

If the contaminating DNA fragments are long enough you wont notice restriction enzyme cutting without running your gel longer to resolve high MW bands. The only other possibilities that I can think of would be the presence of some other lowcopy plasmid in your strain or some sequencespecific anomaly that causes the plasmids to tangle with each other or concatenate somehow. Either way I wouldnt worry about it unless you get goofy results when using your purified plasmid.

Got a collective gasp from my lab group during that presentation!Argument for black background this allows the eye to see the colors and localization more clearly.  Turn offdown lights during presentation.Do not use different color letters for mergewhite or light grey is my ..,labrats,df7dgxk,6,t5_2srnv

11305356,0,t1_dfdf3r9,How come the other person said that it didnt produce a band? Im a bit confused. Doesnt that mean it didnt work if it didnt produce a band?,labrats,dfdg1ax,1,t5_2srnv
11320820,0,t1_dff270h,Like  years ago I was getting interviewed for a technician job that was pretty much just running western blots all day while doing basic HPLC sample prep. It was a little basic even for me but I was thrust into an unexpected job hunt with no solid leads and wasnt going to be picky. They told me that the other person interviewing for the position had a PhD. It was super depressing.,labrats,dff72bn,6,t5_2srnv
11349176,0,t3_61ynjo,Really tough to say since we dont know the structure of your parent molecule.  Does it have or not have charge?   If it does theres a huge array of different columns IP reagents and buffers to try.  If it is just a an organic molecule with no aminecarboxylic acid groups that can carry charge then you might have to just spend more time doing development with your solvent system or try something different than what you have now.  Sorry its just the way development is and why experts who know how to achieve results through rapid development earn the big bucks.  ,labrats,dfiepgu,1,t5_2srnv

11462453,0,t3_63m2a4,Depends on the relationship you have with your PI. If you have a healthy relationship then you should feel comfortable talking to him about whats best for your development. He will likely encourage you to broaden your horizons and shop around so to speak as thats typically good for undergrads and young graduate students. He can also help with letters of recommendation and what not. He can also warn you against joining labs that will not be good for you like if youd only be washing dishes and provide other perspectives. If your relationship with your PI is poor then it probably doesnt matter too much in the grand scheme of things. You need to find a new lab in that case just make sure you provide reasonable notice at least  weeks  as opposed to just not showing up one day. ,labrats,dfv9ftt,19,t5_2srnv

11796798,0,t1_dgx73b1,Forget emails find them in their office and make an appointment to sit down and sort this out. Data organization is one of the most difficult parts of writing your first thesis and you deserve help. Im the mean time the goto is always to look up similar papers and see how they organized their data which it sounds like youre already doing but is about all you can do on your own. Are you sure theres no one else like grad students or postdoc that could help you? ,labrats,dgx7h0p,3,t5_2srnv
