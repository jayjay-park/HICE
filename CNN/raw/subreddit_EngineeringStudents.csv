72,0,t3_1u4kpg,Whenever Ive done a job search I start with the jobs I want the most first and as time goes one I move to the jobs I would like than ones that are ok than just being an engineering job.  How quickly you move from one end to the other is up to you.  Generally I try to get a job before some deadline like graduation run out of money shot myself because I hate my job so much.Quick look at the resume and it looks pretty good.  Id swap the technical skills and experience sections.  You want to show them what they care about most first.  Skills are always more of a fluff item.  If you have shit experience but you are good with Autocad they probably arent going to hire you over someone with good experience and doesnt know autocad.

1871,0,t3_1u431l,I would suggest choosing a nonspecialized engineering major such as chemical electrical mechanical or even computer science. These disciplines span many industries so you can completely change fields while remaining in the same discipline. However you could not easily change disciplines Ex. chemical to electrical. Having a more specialized degree such as biomedical aerospace or petroleum can make it a bit harder to switch fields but its not impossible.Bottom line dont let the curriculum for your major limit your learning. If you want to learn something go learn it! After your first job your educational background becomes much less important. What matters is that you have skills that are useful to an employer.,EngineeringStudents,ceengl5,2,t5_2sh0b

210715,0,t1_cf1pd6t,Yup its a really cool way to get hands on expirience you dont get in classes. Employers recruit extensively from our program after the career fair several companies come by to our pit and talk with all the members. All of our technical sponsors get a resume folder of all the members and we also have alumni who send emails to the team when theyre looking for employeesinterns.If youre near the top and can get in there are tons of opportunities my advice is usually for people who transfer from across the country expecting to just walk in. CS advisors have to deal with tons of people so its not meant to seem offensive they just cant get involved with people outside the major because there are so many and they have to help the ones who are already in. I transferred from a CC with over  credits and only need  quarters to graduate which is really nice. I knocked out all my math  at CC and was able to transfer directly in. I also knocked out all of my easy electives so I have no distractions from my studies. Campus housing seems nice but pretty expensive I thought it was like over  or something. Its cool if you think that youll struggle to meet people but if you put yourself out there it shouldnt be too hard. Join clubs go to events and youll meet tons of people.

237630,0,t3_1wtx2r,Consider what chemical engineering actually is. Its a mix of business and economic smarts  physics  math  chemistry. So if you are purely interested in just the science you might want to go for a science degree instead. Chemical engineering is about practicality. We apply theory to make real things happen outside the laboratory and into viable products for society.The bread and butter of the degree is understanding how energy is used to power reactions and is transported from one area to another. This understanding is taught through transport phenomena classes fluid mechanics and heat transfer thermodynamics basically the study of energy and how it is used separations phenomena mass transfer and reaction kinetics. There are other classes of course but these are the language of the chemical engineer. Using these together allows a chemical engineer to design a process that uses or supplies energy to make something happen usually chemical reactions necessary to make a real product. This is the physics that we deal with....physics at the molecular level. Not so much physics of buildings or moving objects etc. but molecules and how they transfer energy.The chemistry we learn is less than what a chemist learns since a chemist usually takes synthesis classes and more theory classes but we learn enough to be able to do our job.We also learn some economics statistics and business skills to design feasible economic processes.You should also consider if you are ready for the work. Theres no way for you to really comprehend just how much work this degree is right now. Its enough to make me want to quit every so often but I dont because Im almost there. But make up in your mind whether you are willing to pursue something this rigorous. You will probably have less free time than many your friends who are not engineers.Having said this I think it makes more sense to try chemical engineering. Youll know soon enough if you dont like it. If you dont like it or its too much for you you can change your major to chemistry or something else.

281121,0,t3_1x83s4,Bolted Joints are very interesting. Lets say you are clamping two plates with some bolts torqued to near or just at yield. The only thing you have done is slightly yielded the bolt but this also produces a high clamping force. Now when you apply a load to try to separate the plates what happens is you just reduce the clamping force. Very little extra force goes into the fastener because the bolt length cant change until the plates separate.If you have cyclic loading this is a good thing since the alternating stress if very low. If you just barely snugged down the bolt your alternating stress would be large because it would go from near zero to the full load.,EngineeringStudents,cf9wght,1,t5_2sh0b

Hibbelers book is great for most subjects but Mohrs circle is an exception to that.  Hibbelers book does it differently than most other texts and I find his way is more confusing.  Hibbeler focuses more on using the formulas for principle stresses rather than ploting them on mohrs circle.  For a better explanation check out Shigleys mechanical engineering design book Chapter .  Your school library or engineering club should have one.  Or try higdon and stiles mechanics of materials. By the way those formulas are dirived from mohrs circle.

515416,0,t3_2015c5,Well yeah. The units are related because the concepts are related and the math is a representation of that. A coulomb is indeed just a specific number of electrons. That represents a certain amount of charge. That much charge over a second is an ampere. Why does it not seem right?And force is the same. The newton the kilogram the metre the second. And a pascal for example similarly. Pressure is force over area. One pascal one newton one square metre. Defining the units in terms of each other keeps the math as simple as possible  or rather keeps conversion as simple as possible so you can just do the math.Having said which the reason you dont get what a kilogram metre is that theres not really such a thing in this context. Theres a certain amount of mass  measured in kilograms. Theres a certain acceleration defined as change in velocity over time. Velocity is distance over time. So velocity is ms acceleration is change in vs thus ms. So one kilogram under an acceleration of ms has a force of  newton. A kilogram metre isnt really a thing  its a kilogram affected by an acceleration of a metre per second per second.

I know its in the Courtney book and also Mechanical Metallurgy by Dieter is a good reference.Plastic deformation in a single crystal is accommodated by lattice slip dislocation slip or twinning.  The stress referred to as the critical resolved shear stress is that to induce dislocation slip in the glide plane.  Polycrystalline aggregates will have additional effects due to solutes precipitates and grains which interact with dislocations.  For example solutes pin dislocations during slip causing Luders banding more dense less mobile solutes and the PortevinLe Chatelier effect more mobile solutes during plastic deformation.  In general plastic deformation of the metal is governed by the interaction of dislocations and numerous microstructural features that inhibit their free motion in the glide plane.edit On  Im not sure of the absolute correct answer for this.  I know for AlMg alloys an anodic phase to the Al matrix is formed at the grain boundaries AlMg.  This results in corrosion of this phase leading to intergranular corrosion and intergranular stress corrosion cracking.  Thus if you have more grain boundaries then you have more corrosion sites for this example.

799152,0,t3_238rvf,gtWhat branch of engineering did you pursue? If possible where do you work?  I pursued a Computer Science Engineering degree for undergrad.  I currently work for a small  person technical consulting company.gtWhat is a typical work week or work day like for you?  What tasks do you routinely do?   I work from home about half of the time and drive to the office the other half.  My office is about  minutes away.  I will start the day with trying to understand what tasks I need to accomplish.  Usually I will have a deadline for some code Im working on which makes this easy.  I spend most of my day coding.  I also talk to my supervisors and absorb their expertise attend mostly online meetings and test others code.gtWhat aspect of your work is the most interesting?  Most interesting would be seeing my code run on a clients machine.  Its satisfying to see your creation actually do something.  Ive only been out of college for  months and have contributed to a few multimillion dollar implementations.gtThe most challenging?   For me the most challenging part of this job is asking for help when Im working remotely.  Its easy enough when Im in the office to just walk over and ask my boss a question.  Its much more difficult to ask him when Im at home.gtWhere did you go to school and what degrees did you receive? I went to Lehigh University got a Computer Science Engineering degree.gtWhat was the most exciting aspect of pursuing an engineering degree?  For me it was the projects I was involved in.  I had an oncampus programming job that was extremely helpful with me landing my job after school and I had a few major projects that simply floored me at the end how awesome they were.gtWhat was the most difficult aspect?  I had trouble with nonmajor classes.  Classes the university made me take that I didnt care about.  I would spend my time focusing on the cool engineering classes and classes that were just humanities or social science requirements would sort of fall towards the wayside.gtWhat is the most important skill to learn while I am pursuing my engineering degree?   This is a total homer but PROGRAMMING!  Just having it on your resume makes you stand out.  Its the most marketable skill to have nowadays and you will be behind if you dont learn it.gtWhat other advice would you offer someone pursuing an engineering degree?  Ill give you the  pieces of advice my father gave me going into college. Go to every class take good notes and review those notes later in the day.  This helps the information to be stored in long term memory.. Do your homework as its assigned not as its due..  Study along the way for tests.If you take these three tidbits of advice seriously you will succeed without being overly stressed.,EngineeringStudents,cgv47at,2,t5_2sh0b

892795,1,t3_24cfaj,I doubt that DeVry is ABET accredited. While having that isnt absolutely necessary it does automatically make a degree less desirable because it means the classes and coursework you did wasnt held to the same standards as other schools.To be honest I had no idea that DeVry offered engineering degrees. Really I wasnt aware that they had any year degrees at all.  That might tell you something about how potential employers will feel about your degree when you are looking for jobs.Biomedical engineering is not really the smartest choice as an undergraduate degree. If you want to do any real BME work you will need an advanced degree to even apply to most jobs and if you ever decide to go into another field a BS in BME is less desirable than a more standard engineering degree mechanicalelectrical.In most cases a EE ME or ChE undergrad degree will also be more desired when applying to graduate programs in BME because in graduate school you will focus on one area of BME and having an undergraduate degree in that area helps you get started more easily.For example if you want to do neuroengineering graduate work it helps a lot to have an electrical engineering background because that knowledge is harder to gain at the graduate level while the biology knowledge you will need is easier to learn as you go. A similar statement can be made for tissue engineering with a chemical engineering background.TLDR A biomedical engineering BS is ideal for people who will work directly in the biomedical engineering field with that degree and who dont plan to migrate to other types of engineering jobs. Unfortunately those jobs dont really exist unless you want to be a technician who fixes lab equipment at hospitals. Not that thats a bad job it just isnt usually what people go into BME to do.gt For referencegt EE  electrical engineeringgt ME  mechanical engineeringgt ChE  chemical engineeringgt BME  biomedical engineering,EngineeringStudents,ch5rjva,0,t5_2sh0b

People first assume that it is arrogance that drives people like him but work with them and you realize that it is not arrogance but an incredibly deep rooted fear of failure. They have been told all their lives that they will fail unless they do extremely well and they attend elite private and public high schools where they are competing with people just as dedicated smart and driven as they are. They respond by cutting back on sleep working on an insane number of projects axing their already minimal social life and studying until they collapse. They often have superb memory and can tell you of every error they made over their middle school and high school lives. When working on projects this fear takes over. They will either . Drive everyone else in the project mad with insanely high expectations and short deadlines. They have no life and live for grades and awards so expect that others will as well. . Take the project hole themselves up in their dorm for the period between assignment and due date and then pop out with this spectacular projectwritten report and just slap names on it afterward. They have no ethics and look for loopholes in everything limit is to spend  on the project they borrow expensive components and pool money with friends in different classes for the same subject and just share em. If you have a high GPA relative to them and are bright they treat you like their superior. They strive to learn your secrets and methods. Lower GPA? They treat you as a loser who benefits their curve and cut you out of projects because dont care as much and not as dedicated.A danger to their grade. And they usually dont even work in engineering afterward. The wander off to things like management consulting and investment banking as they are worried that they arent good enough for engineering will make a mistake and get in trouble with the engineering association. Their fear drives everything you do. Look at kingpollys page. He is planning  hour study weeks during the summer so he can learn everything before school starts. I knew a few guys who did that in highschool. They existed for school. No girlfriends no hanging out no what we would consider friends and they just did homework studied came to school and slept. Their success is their SAT score to the point it is prominent on their linkedin page. They only do extra stuff that can win awards. Debate Quizbowl ect ect. Find them all there. Volunteering school events sports school rallies dances prom ect. Never see them not once. One of them once told me when i congratulated him on winning second place in a national writing contest that second place is still not success. They suck to work with because they are hardly people. They are robots acting on one central directive Succeed dont fail. And view success as a numerical process. They do well but at great cost. ,EngineeringStudents,chlwuae,42,t5_2sh0b

Ultimately I wouldnt spend a lot of effort in digesting textbook material. The professor doesnt care whether or not you read the textbook. He cares about whether or not you can solve the problem.

You may want to take a hard look at yourself and figure out whether you really want this and are willing to go all in and give it your best shot next Spring. Failing is an extreme in undergrad. It means you did really really bad mostly because the effort wasnt there. I failed a class in undergrad albeit a CFD class and it was because I didnt prepare well and performed poorly as a result.

The point is you can totally screw up while an undergrad but you are allowed only so many mistakes and you better be damn sure you dont make those same mistakes again.Its going to get more difficult and you need to continuously improve on your fundamentals to succeed in later years and professionally.

However that doesnt make them any better because people still feel a similar connection to a story no matter if it was fictional or real.

If you have a pretty good idea than that is a really good start.For example if you want to get into the automotive industry then your schools FSAE team is the perfect place. Majority of my teammates have went to companies such as Honda Chrysler and GM.If you have an interest in Robotics join a robotics team take classes related to robotics or perform your own robotics project. If you have an interest in renewable energy get involved in something like the Department of Energys Solar Decathlon competition. If your school has it.But you see where I am going with this? I have been looking for a job for quite some time now and many jobs out there prefer candidates who have some type of experience or school related to the job. Having this will put you ahead of all the other applicants and students come post graduation. If they can see how passionate you are about something it makes massive difference. Also an internship or coop in your field of interest will really put you ahead. So basically this is all assuming you have an idea of what you want to do. If you dont know yet thats ok. Getting involved in school organizations and getting work experience in internships or coops will be enough to put you ahead of many in these tough times.,EngineeringStudents,chvdw31,2,t5_2sh0b

Take these numbers with a grain of salt as they are a selling point for the school.  They will likely look pretty good. No one can guarantee the economy.  I graduated in  right before the economy tanked and couldnt land a job for more than hr nonengineering.  The US federal loans can be suspended or at least could at the time so I survived with my debt intact !.  All that to say even great numbers from a school today doesnt guarantee their students  or you  anything in the future.  A better reality check would be their hiring rates from  to current or at the very least  to current.  Looking at how the economy affected their grads.  Ask them to parse out grad school applicants from hires.  My school had a habit of combining the two.  As to how long it will take to pay off k in loans that should be basic math.

What happens when its being compressed? What does this look like? What changes? Really get in to understanding how it works dont memorize it. If you memorize it chances are you dont understand it and the problem on the test wont have the exact same conditions that you memorized. Once youve got the basic cycle down move on to modifications to it. Add reheat. Add a second compressor stage. Add a generator on the end.

1311096,0,t3_291chu,Cal Poly grad. Id love to stump for my school since the success of previous Cal Poly grads at my workplace helped me get the job I have now. But in the interest of being objective I would claim that no employer is going to rule out any CSU or UC student. There are numerous factors in hiring such as GPA extracurricular work internship experience etc. I imagine school is somewhere behind those but not insignificant if you end up in a situation like mine where so many engineers that the company has hired from your school have worked out well or theres a special relationship between the company and the school due to lab grants internship programs etc. If you are lacking in any one of those factors you can make it up by excelling in others.Ive worked with both students who came out of practical schools like Cal Poly and research schools like UCs and I cant say I notice a huge difference between one or the other. The practical graduates get their hands dirty really quickly and solve problems with experience while some of the students with the heavy theoretical background are able to solve some very complex problems with their vast theoretical knowledge despite a lack of handson experience. It mostly just depends on the student and the type of personality but ultimately youll need a healthy mix of both to thrive at a job.Id personally recommend a CSU simply because of the cost of the UC system which I blame partly on increased prestige and other factors like class sizes. If youre going to throw gobs of money at an education Id rather pay the system that gives a closer interactive relationship with the teachers that are supposed to be teaching you things. The fact that you somehow pay less for that is a bonus.,EngineeringStudents,cih45a8,4,t5_2sh0b

I work part time during the school year at the internship I have so its also a good way to apply what Ive learned in school in a real world environment.One word of advice for engineering students is  never hold a part time job that is not engineering related. Work is a toll on your schedule and mind and if its not directly related to your major all youre doing is killing your study potential and extracurriculars just so you can work at some retail or fast food dump.

The author says this nonsensegt Matlab is not it is a linear algebra package. This means that if you need to add some nonnumerical capabilities to your application it gets hairy very fast.This is simply not true.  Matlab even has support for objectoriented programming for quite some time now and also supports exceptions and unit testing.  Even if it didnt its trivial to extend matlab to call external functions.Matlab might have started as a scripting language built around a linear algebra package but nowadays Matlab aint your fathers matlab anymore.Next regarding this claimgt .

No need to drag Python into the picture.Another important point which the author prefers to simply ignore happens to be the main reason Matlab is so popular and is used instead of any other tool Matlabs development environment.   Nothing in Python comes even close to it.  If someone is doing sciency things that person will end up having to run a lot of run once scripts evaluate variables run some numbers manually compare and navigate through tons of data save files load files save them again switch from path to path... you name it.What does Python offer that does any of this?  Nothing unfortunately.  Theres spyder which is incomparably limited and still stuck with Python . and theres ipython which doesnt come even close to doing the same job.  What else is there?  Nothing.Python may even be a far better programming language than Matlab but Matlab isnt the de facto standard in science and engineering because of how nice its scripting language is.    Matlab is popular because if does everything its users want to do and it does it well.  Python may be a nicer programming language and even be secondbest in any other conceivable category but if the best it can offer is to be secondbest in any relevant and meaningfull categorywhy would people want to adopt it over the first choice? ,EngineeringStudents,citkpck,1,t5_2sh0b

1435705,0,t3_2ajxut,I will point out that I do think Cal misses something big here thoughgtOnce youve developed an insight for every concept in a technical course the final step before a test is to do a small number of practice problems for each to practice applying it.If you are just using a small set of problems to study from I think youre preparing yourself for a world of hurt on exams. I covered a little about this here I think its key to combine his insight about concepts with a wide variety of difficult problems so that you can connect your concept intuition to direct problemsolving application.

Plus I would have some inschool research opportunities at my LAC. Just not engineering...I dont have schools in mind officially but a few ideas off the top of my head are UIUC Harvey Mudd UMichigan Purdue and that one school in NY.If I transfer I wouldnt get the chance to participate in the liberal arts program at least at UIUC because their engineering program has only so much room for liberal arts classes. My AP credits and the liberal arts classes Ive taken at my school fulfill the liberal arts requirements so I would probalby get in and just try to do a straight shot with all the core engineering classes to graduate asap.Do you surround yourself with only engineering students at a large school or no?

But dont do engineering because its your only option unless you are a very confident wellrounded motivated person because if youre in engineering and you hate it you better be able to come back home and have something to keep you sane. If you dont think you have the discipline then is engineering really an option for you? Im not saying that it isnt but you need to ask yourself because youre ultimately responsible for the amount of discipline you do or dont have. Hey life moves fast but think about your past. What things make time seem like they passed slowly? The things that you really remember? Probably good things experiences that you treasure and value. What days do you forgetwhat ones seem like they could all basically be boiled down into the same essence? Probably the days that youve been at school when you didnt want to be just going through the day waiting to get home then going to sleep only to do it again. Thats the problem. Do things that are valuable do something youll remember doing. And thats all up to you it has nothing to do with what youre studying. I can tell youre a planner. Thats good I guess but you cant plan around things like What if I get a wife or a job?. If theres something you really want to do then fucking do it. If you find youre  in a decent job bored as fuck then quit and go do what youve always wanted to do. And when it comes to the girl thing dont worry about it. Really in those situations you tend to do what you want anyway. And youre always in control as to whether or not youre in a relationship so if you dont want one or arent ready dont get in one. Dont plan so much dont think so much about yourself this is why I said pompous  I understand that its a post about yourself asking for advice but if you can say that much its obvious you spend a lot of time thinking about it.

Every couple semesters in community college I ran into that class with the bad book or bad professor and always gave into the itching nagging thought of dropping. I regretted it on about  of the drops. That history professor can get fucked lol.Im at university now and my solid mechanics class switched the book literally an hour before the first class from a good book to a poorly written and confusing book. The homework is easily x more unnecessarily complicated than the other book hardly any pertinent info is given in the examples yadda yadda... even the professor hates the book hates teaching out of it and apologizes nearly every class.  days ago I was stressed and started getting the nagging drop thoughts was deflated and bummed out. Then I remembered how much I regretted not sticking through the previous classes and I decided to what the hell im not the only one struggling so give it hell and take a hit if I have to. If I drop im just going to have to retake the same class same book the only other professor hardly speaks english and had a class average in the s last semester. So yea Im there with you brother ive decided to man up and give it hell good luck with however you decide. Sometimes it is necessary but dont let it get inflated in your head and give up too easy.P.S. at my school only C amp up advances and you have  attempts at a class to make a C or they kick you out of the dept.

I personally have very little regards for their school but thats a personal issue with them. I interned with a number of Boilermakers this summer and I can tell you they were quite friendly.I may be able to ease your fears about Illinois dorms. Yes theyre small and not the nicest but to be honest I really enjoy them. Im in a dorm thats considered one of the worst on campus particularly for engineers as were very far away from everything but I chose to return after being put there last year and I will be back again next year. The dorm experience is what you make of it. Most students leave the dorms after their freshman year to live in an apartment but Ive found that if you want to be social staying in the dorms is probably better.The frat life at Illinois is certainly prevalent but I dont know if thats a positive or a negative to you. If you seek it it will be there. If you dont you dont have to interact with it much.

2251861,0,t1_clq1j37,Ok first off I said I have no university experience which means I have no classes in math and science in college that doesnt mean that I didnt do it in high school and get excellent grades and it doesnt mean that I dont understand those subjects now.  But like I said to uJuanDeer I think it would be best for me to stick to my current plan of at least obtaining my Associates first so then I will have at least some of that background.gtwhy would you get a degree in liberal arts...The real question is why I want to do engineering.  I did Culture and Media Studies because I enjoyed that discipline and I thought I wanted to go into academia in that field.  Where social science lacks in scientific rigor and objectivity it makes up in selfawareness and critical inquiry.  I think social science is important alongside hard science so that the two may contextualize each other.  Culture and Media Studies specifically focuses on the analysis of cultural bias all around us sometimes scientists do not even realize when this is present but we all should know our history and remember and analyze mistakes like Eugenics.What brought me to engineering are the subjects of cyborg anthropology and transhumanism especially the work of Donna Haraway.  It may seem nonsensical to you but to me cybernetics is actually the logical next step from my other studies.  I really think it is the perfect place for intersection between culture and science and between social science and hard science.,EngineeringStudents,clq1vm6,0,t5_2sh0b

Next understand that in projectile motion problems that ignore air resistance the velocity in the x direction never changes meaning VixVfx. Knowing that any time you are asked to determine the time it takes for something to land you are dealing with ydirection velocity acceleration aka gravity and displacement. Now as others have said the best way to go about solving these problems is to look at the information given and then use that to see what you can find with it.Question  and  have solely to do with the ydirection components. Question  has solely to do with the x direction components. Question  involves combining parts from  and .To start with since you know the initial y velocity and since your acceleration is constant gravity calculate how high the ball will reach D up. Do this by setting your Vfy for this part of the equation since the ball will have a velocity of  in the y direction at its highest point. Then calculate how long it took the ball to travel that distance call this t. Once you have those answers you are half way there. Next calculate how long t it will take the ball to fall from your max height back to its original position plus m which will total to Dup   Dmax. Add t  t to get your total flight time. Knowing t a and Dmax will get you your Vfy or max vertical velocity which occurs just before the ball strikes the ground in this case. To do this set your Viy in this part of the problem.Parts  and  are now complete.To get part  use ttotal and the idea that VixVfx to get your displacement in the xdirection.Part  is now complete.Part  is nothing more than resolving your velocity components into a resultant.

Ive had a deep respect for technology while I was younger and computers came naturally to me at least part of them. It seemed like a natural flow to go towards something computer based. During the course of learning I began to see that computers are extremely complex and within that complexity I started to enjoy other portions of it. I program regularly but dont have a strong regard for it. I mostly just use it as a tool and put it back in the tool chest when its not needed. This led me to put programming aside and focus on the electrical part of technology. Once there my intrigue turned into marvel and wonder and it has been a love affair ever since.

Everyone sees how well Im doing and they think oh you are super smart!. They dont realize that Im a lazy fuck but I actually worked very hard to compensate that. I read books on time management psychology college life and selfdevelopment. I worry a lot about keeping up with the course load more than my classmates anyway. Im always reviewing my weeksmonths to see in which ways I can become more efficientwhere I lost time. Unless midterms are days apart I always prepare way ahead just in case something comes up. Well in all honesty I prepare way ahead because I know I wont do it on time so I actually schedule my time taking into consideration my laziness.So yes I think I do deserve good grades but not as good as what I have. I believe that if I had just one friend who is on the same boat as me always trying to improve myself and being honest with me I would correct all the things that are dragging me back. I dont think Ive ever heard someone tell me you know you did ok but you could have done better. I dont think you gave all of your potential.,EngineeringStudents,cnjs8jc,5,t5_2sh0b

2780730,0,t1_cnk4jrg,Ah multiple integrals can be cheatingly easy though since you can more or less do them in any order.  I remember my teacher thought the way I wrote them was weird if i had two sets with different limits of integrations  Id write one integral and the dx then the next and the dy then the stuff we were integrating.  Made sense but looked weird she said.If you thin visualizing d is hard imagine trying to do it in complex analysis where youre trying to visualize d real x and y imaginary x and y. d is only hard to visualize because we dont see in d we see in d.  Depth we visualize via change of size but take something thin like a chopstick and point it straight at your eye you wont be able to see the depth because there isnt a change in size. Interestingly enough there is a kind of d drawing called isomorphic drawing where you draw a d shape my drawing three d sides of it front top side.

ALL.Anything short and youre not being honest with yourself about trying everything.  A few extra minutes working with professors alone usually help push you over the edge of understanding.  And if youre on the line of passing coming out the back end of the class and all you need is that class to graduate typically that professor is going to take into account your willingness to come to his office and pour your heart into trying to understand.  Its your money.  You spend it on the college.  The college will allocate these resources.  Use them.  Otherwise the percentage of your tuition thats paying for you to maybe use the TAtutorProfessors Office hours are being flushed.

For thick cylinder problems the radial and hoop stress in each cylinder vary according tor  A  Br  A  BrThe Lam constants A and B must be determined using  boundary conditions. A boundary condition usually involves knowing a stress or strain value at a particular radius. Here are examplesAt the inner radius r  ri the pressure is pi and hence r  pi. The corresponding boundary condition is pi  A  BriAt the outer radius r  ro there is no pressure. The corresponding boundary condition is  A  BroAt this point youd have two equations and two unknowns A and B. Knowing A and B you can compute whatever stress you want at whatever radius you want using the Lam equations. Here are more examples of boundary conditions youll come acrossThe maximum hoop stress is not to exceed  MPa. The maximum hoop stress will generally occur at the inner radius so MPa  A  BriThe outer radius is built in to the wall and is restrained from movement. Hence   ur  . From Hookes law  E    r Subbing in the Lam equations  E A  Bro  A  Bro For this particular question you know the internal pressure and external pressure so you can write two boundary conditions determine A and B and then solve for  at the inner and outer radius. You can also plot them using the Lam equations. Edit let me know if you cover compound cylinders rotating cylinders and cylinders with thermal stress.

The greater the interfacing surface area the greater the rate of heat transfer.Think about a cup of coffee  if you leave it sitting it will slowly transfer heat to the ambient air.  However if you stir the coffee more of the warmer particles will interface with the ambient air and the overall fluid will cool faster.Its the same thing with turbulent vs. laminar flow.  In laminar flow the interface between the fluids is small.  In turbulent flow the warm and cold fluids are constantly mixing and transferring heat.,EngineeringStudents,cq7puub,1,t5_2sh0b

3688792,0,t3_32mys0,A similar question about GPAs was asked not even  hours ago.In short it depends it really does. Do you have prior internships or coop experience? Did you do extensive projects or clubs? Did you do a major senior design project such as FSAE Baja DBF etc? Are you connecteddo you know people? Did you go to a highly recognized school or a smaller more regional less well known engineering school? Are you personable? Are you applying online or at a career fair at your school? Is your school a pipeline school for the company in question? Do you have prior directapplicable experience? Etc etc etc. The list goes on and on.The biggest thing that will help get over a lackluster GPA is prior experience. It doesnt matter whether its internshipscoops research project senior design or whatever. This is a perfect counterweight to a sub. GPA.I have noticed that many people here have stated that the company never asked about their GPA in interviews. Imo I wouldnt expect to be asked about my GPA in phone or inperson interviews. They have already seen your GPA on your resumeCV on the online application or they have seen you have omitted it. Despite whatever your GPA may be they have decided to call you anyways. They have already made the decision that whatever your GPA is it is sufficient to them. At this point they want to talk to you about what else you did and make sure youre not a psycho.As for what GPAs are needed for different things  again I think there is no clear answer to this. In general the larger companies are going to have a baseline cutoff GPA that they generally will not go below usually in the .  . range. This is a guideline they have and they do not absolutely stick to it. You will hear exceptions due to those with great resumes and a lot of past experience. This has the potential to make up for a lower GPA but that is at the discretion of the company or the specific hiring manager. Different industries also have different requirements. Aerospace tends to require higher GPAs. This is in part because they can. A large portion of new graduates want to work for them so they can be picky.I think most positions within a company for new hires will have the same expectations and wants for a GPA. They want you to meet the company requirement but they definitely care more about your practical experience. The exception to this would be the analytical positions e.g. stress analyst which generally require a high GPA and practical experience. However many of these position require advanced degrees anyways but not all of them.In summary it just depends. Your mileage may vary.,EngineeringStudents,cqcqwbe,1,t5_2sh0b

3774398,0,t3_33my7a,If you are only staying for a minor I would say it is a waste of money. The cost of staying an extra semester or even year is much higher than most people calculate. They tend to not factor in the amount of money they are missing out on making. So not only do you pay tuition room and board and interest on all of that but you also miss out of x of your yearly salary. Which if youd be making k US and you stay one semester extra  of a year. You would be paying tuition and k before taxes of salary you could have made.People on here tend to not like this point of view and they encourage to stay in college longer then you need. I really urge against that because you are missing out on real world experience and ALOT of money.EDIT This is viewing it from purely an economic perspective. If you really want a minor and think it is worth the amount of money to you then that is a personal choice. But to be honest the minor will cost a lot and most likely not make you more marketable enough to justify the cost in an economic sense.,EngineeringStudents,cqmicai,5,t5_2sh0b

At  and shortly after being told Id only see a significant pay increase if I switched to sales and of course after being given totally unrealistic sales targets I had a log hard think about my situation and finally accepted the truth I didnt give  damns about working in finance and just trying to help the rich get richer and make enough money to join their club. In my spare time I was interested in electronics yet had no opportunity to really educate myself about them. At this point I just kind of decided I didnt want to do my job any more and wanted to work with emerging technologies. Finance certainly isnt the right industry for that. So I thought great Ill go back to uni and skill up. Science wasnt appealing to me but engineering with its unique approach to real world problem solving and high job demand in Australia became very attractive. I went back to uni and Im still working away.

4056488,0,t3_30bp33,Im an intern at UTAS right now too Engineering Labs. I worked in the Labs last year as well. My first year was a little slowmostly due to the lack of extensive technical knowledge I had coming in from my freshman year of college. This year however Ive got a lot more to do and a lot more solo work running a test by myself taking over an engineer on vacations projects and more. Its been interesting so far. The best advice I can give you is this . Keep asking for stuff to do from everyone you work with. The Labs has like  engineers and Ive worked on at least one project with each one of them and I ask the EE guys for work all the time. Not sure where you are or what youre working on but make sure to ask for work from more than just your direct boss. . Dont be afraid to ask for help. Most of the people there dont expect you to know things. Give everything the old college try and see where you get. If you have issues ask for help and someone will probably at least point you in the right direction.I second uGyangs comment about it being a boring company unless theres a specific project handed to you reasoning for  above.

4505935,0,t3_3cqjgo,For Google Microsoft other toptier CS jobs this is more appropriate for a CS subreddit as software developer positions have different recruiting procedures from general engineering positions. Here are my tips. Also this is a pretty popular topic and you should be able to find lots of info about this through Google.. PROGRAM!! Find projects you are interested in open source personal website robotics team twitter clone etc. and write them. Focus on things you like or want to learn more about. This will build a portfolio of relevant skills and help you figure out what you like doing. You must be very good at programming to get a job at these places. Its also important that these projects are significant. Programming an Android app that just takes notes is irrelevant but a full game or app that interfaces with your own backend that tracks stats and does more interesting stuff etc. is worthwhile. Still do the first Android app but know that you need to do more to impress these companies.. Learn your data structures and algorithms cold. You should know mergesort and quicksort and when to choose one vs the other. Whats a hash table and is one implemented? How to implement a queue? Whats BigO notation and can you figure out the complexity of your implementation quickly? Is it optimal? CLRS is the most recommended textbook for learning this.. GPA. From WVU Im guessing theres a GPA cutoff. You must have a relatively GPA to get your resume through the normal channels noticed. However if you have really cool projects open source contributions know a friend at Google who can refer you then the GPA doesnt matter as much.. Internships. What are you doing this summer? Why arent you working at a software company? It doesnt matter if it isnt Google but previous work experience is very important for next years internship applications and the year afters fulltime applications.. Network. Try to find recent WVU alumni who work at these companies who might be friends of friends LinkedIn is great for this. Once you know those people decently well you can ask for a referral or interview tips etc. You do the all of the above you should be able to get interviews. CS interviews are notorious for being pieces of shit. . Learn how to do software interviews. First use Cracking the Coding Interview to understand how to approach these problems and specific problems. Save  different problems that you havent seen before. Find a friend to give you an interview on  problems you havent seen. . As other posters have mentioned be friendly and engaging during the interview. Beyond technical skill interviewers are looking for someone that they want to sit next to and chat with at lunch. Dont be pretentious shy smelly arrogant or neckbeardy during the interview.,EngineeringStudents,csymgf9,3,t5_2sh0b

The fun part to me of the solid state physics series was how the transport phenomena I studied in fluid mechanics and heatmass transfer share the same basic form as the motion carriers in a pn junction  BJT. The MOS stuff was also interesting in its own right as it reminded me of EampM in basic physics.Think its really interesting that the development and production of all sorts of electronic devices involves a great deal of the ideas I study in ChemE.,EngineeringStudents,ct4j631,1,t5_2sh0b

4592984,0,t3_3dwykl,From what I understand a thesis works a bit different in many parts of the world here its basically a  months fulltime job with the thesis paper at the end but I would think something like this should be laid out in the task description. If its not in your task description your grading should reflect that.If a thesis cant be completed by the time its due it reflects very badly on the advisor especially if they underestimated the work that has to be done.That being said I myself have experience in theses building upon software written by other people especially thesis students and its always a mess. If people only work on it for  months it is absurd to expect a healthy project to evolve from the codebase and I have seen many advisors ignoring this fact.In the end I can only advise anyone to read their task descriptions carefully discuss its feasibility with their advisor and only then decide if its something you want to be graded on.,EngineeringStudents,ct9jeze,0,t5_2sh0b

You can easily knock out  lessons or chapters in a book daily during your BSEE so I would leave it to then.Advancing as an intermediate C programmer is more interesting.  Its also hard because there arent a ton of practice problems out there that you can do like math so you might need to pick or be assigned a miniproject or two that you can explore while you simultaneously read more advanced books about the language.exercism.io is nice for bitesized programming problems though the C path is a little buggy if you dont install exactly the version of boost that they recommend.Also VBA sucks use python.,EngineeringStudents,cxs8fab,2,t5_2sh0b

That would make it listed as MATH whatever.Just how the Economics course all engineering majors have to take is listed as an Economics course even though it is required for engineering majors. It is taught by an economics professor and is not listed as an engineering course its listed as ECON  I think.It might be a specific class that I dont have an option to take but unless it has ME in front of it it does not count towards my specific major gpa it would then count towards my cumulative gpa.Maybe I wasnt clear about it on my first post but this isnt that hard to understand and definitely doesnt warrant you being a passive aggressive cunt.

6322704,0,t3_427eor,Both of your tubes are open ended into atmosphere. Thats the easy answer why. Ignore the rest if you like.So they are both subject to the atmospheric pressure as a base reference line. The difference between the two is gage pressure.Now you actually have two different problems you linked. The one with the screen shot of the book the problem has an increase in pressure going from a to b. So your gage pressure would be positive it increases.In the solution picture going from a to b be careful here they switched a and b around you have a decrease in pressure. So you have a negative gage pressure it decreases.For vacuum pressure one end would have to be closed or attached to a vacuum source. In other words NOT exposed to atmospheric pressure. Then absolute pressure in the closed side would be lower than the atmospheric pressure in the open end. The difference would then be vaccuum pressure.This site may help visualize it a bit better.,EngineeringStudents,cz8blxc,2,t5_2sh0b

I joined the Infantry and I loved it didnt plan on getting out but the Taliban had other plans apparently. I MEBd out in September  and by December I decided I wanted to go to school for Engineering.

My oldest  is okay but sometimes I will put my youngest . up on my desk and sit there and do homework because thats the only way she is happy.

As someone preparing to start my PhD in the fall I have talked to a number of professors at highly ranked programs across the country. Far and away the most common path for their PhD graduates has been into industry. A PhD can prepare you for a high level senior engineering position where you get to be involved with the real meat and potatoes design work.With a PhD you are also qualified for work at government research labs which is sort of halfway between academic research as a university professor and a job in industry where the deliverable is a product that consumers will see.Obviously I would not recommend a PhD to anyone. It takes a special kind of passion and dedication to incur the opportunity cost of five more years of school and research.

I had schematics source code calculations a presentation at a major conference proof of work formal recognition in a press release about one of the facilities where my hardware ended up and draft papers. Other people leaving undergraduate research with me had their undergraduate research thesis and some knowledge. They could not prove to companies that they actually worked at a level that is expected in industry.Industry cares about if you can prove that you actually did X assuming that X is something impressive. Implementing yet another extremely simple thing isnt all that impressive. Designing building testing and using a complex system is. Heck you dont even need to lead to the design. You just need to work on it. You should be able to talk about the entire system in the back of your hand if youre still working on it.

It describes the ratio of which the turbine does actual work compared to the ideal isentropic work.Your book is probably saying the the first law efficiency is that because it is derived from the first law Q  W  delta U.

Others still let me update them because I still have access to my uni email address. And still others stopped functioning after the license died out. Generally speaking the Uni and software companies arent going to take the time to revoke your license after you leave. Theyre just going to remove your access to get another copy. So if you currently have to register every X months to keep it functioning it will die. If it is connecting to a license server to work its going to die. If it works just fine without ever asking you to log in youre probably going to get to keep it forever. Of the programs you mentioned I think MATLAB and MathCad should stay active but your uni. might be using a different licensing system than mine did I bought both from the university book store at heavy discounts.

Obviously it looks better on your resume if you have a massively successful project the results in prominent articles in scientific journals but that doesnt mean the work you did is any better or worse.The point of a masters degree is to show that you are capable of understanding complex scientific concepts executing experiments designed to study those concepts and analyzing the results of those experiments to see if those concepts are accurate or inaccurate.  No where does in there does it say that your experiments need to be successful.That said when youre wrapping up your project it is much more difficult to write up in the event the experiment does not succeed.  This is because you then need to figure out why it didnt succeed.  And not a handwaving this background might be wrong I tried this and it didnt work and then I ran out of time at the end of the semester explanation either.But if you can look at your project and confidently state we thought this would work at the beginning but in performing the experiments it did not work because of reasons X Y and Z then I doubt you adviser would have any grounds to stop you from graduating.,EngineeringStudents,d4fogub,76,t5_2sh0b

Typically youre admitted to the graduate school and you register for online courses but have the option to take the classes at the university this was the case with every school that I looked at W.P.I. Purdue U.O.I. etc....The classes you take are exactly the same as the classes at the school the on campus sections lecture is recorded and uploaded and you watch them online and both on campus and online students do the exact same homework tests and projects.The pros areConvenience  The lectures are now on your time instead of the schools. I work full time so this was the deciding factor for me. Pausingrewinding  Very helpful for note taking or when you need a break.ConsIsolation from other students  Youre pretty much on your own for everything you can email professors or post in discussion boards but its not the same as face to face interaction. You have to be an independent learner to succeed. You also do not make any connections with students or professors. Much more discipline is required  You now have the option to put off lectures and do things like use your phone during class. Also youre typically at home or work  two places where there are always distractions. Typically cant do a thesis  Its possible I think but not practical.That means that this is very likely going to be your terminal degree. I think that if your life situation precludes you from being an on campus student and you are an independent learner then an online degree is the way to go but if you have the option you should probably do it on campus. Regarding the accreditation question ABET will only accredit one engineering degree per school per field so its almost always the Bachelors. If a schools undergrad program is accredited then no need to worry. I cant find a source for the above but if you search ABETs website for accredited ME Masters programs you only get two results Here is a online readiness quiz that you can take Good luck!,EngineeringStudents,d4pikh1,1,t5_2sh0b

And that was doing  hours of being a research assistant with a wife and a toddler. To get a . you have to work very hard on studying the subject AND THE PROFs TESTING TECHNIQUES. I suggest talking to upper classmen and go to your profs office and study their books. They will teach with a new textbook but will frame exam questions on what they learned with. Other than that? Go to class take notes and if you work one problem set in advance you can take any night off for socialize. Discipline young padawan.,EngineeringStudents,d4q1k2q,1,t5_2sh0b

8204633,0,t3_4rpj08,Your major isnt gonna make or break you. ME is versatile. If you like the biomedical field then seek out experiences in that area lab and research work internships in the biomedical industry working at a hospital joining a professional society related to medicine or joining a club. That is what will help you break into the medical field not necessarily the list of classes on your transcript. When you are a senior take technical electives in biomedical engineering and biology. Nothing is stopping you. I know ME undergrads who have worked on surgical instruments and medical devices and I know professors in my department ME professors whose research is in this field. I also know of a professor who does FEA applied to the human body to understand trauma and injuries. I was at a conference once and met an Iranian student who was civil engineering by education but was pursuing graduate studies that involved modeling the spine computationally to better understand spinal cord injuries makes sense if you think about it! I agree ME curriculum can get boring as shit. It is too broad at the undergraduate level to be interesting. Believe me I dont like  of my classes. My favorite classes so far have been theatre philosophy and the classes involving the thermal sciences lol. I only tolerate it because I know an ME degree is one small step for my long term goals. But what you do with your ME knowledge is whats important. Apply it to your interests be good at what you do dont be a cookie cutter one size fits all engineering student. Specialize and be exceptional and you wont have issues getting into your field. Good luck. ,EngineeringStudents,d534tl0,3,t5_2sh0b

8221643,0,t3_4rx6vw,Youve gotten some pretty good answers here.I am a grad student and use one of the new  Macbooks The super thin USBC type and personally love it. I really wanted to get by with just a tablet but its just not quite practical yet. This was a nice compromise of portability and capability.I think theres two big things to consider Go with what you know. Have you been using macs your whole life so if something acts funny youll probably know how to fix it without going to IT? The night before a paper is due is not when you want to be stonewalled by a cryptic error. You have gotten a lot of conflicting opinions on whether macs can run the software you need for school. In general the answer is yes  The Office suite programs like Matlab LTSpice and so on all have well supported mac ports. Probably  of the software you will ever need will run on OS X. The rest will probably work just fine in Parallels or BootCamp.I have encountered exactly  piece of software that didnt have a mac version and didnt run well under a VM Though in fairness it didnt run well in general. I just installedran it under boot camp and all was fine. The main issue I had was just that I didnt have windows set up with my workflow which slowed things down a bit. If youre going back and forth regularly you can overcome this pretty easily.So in my opinion  leads back to  gt Go with what you know and can work with. The chances of you encountering something any given laptop cannot handle is pretty low. Similarly you do not need a  laptop to maybe get by. The baseline macbook pros or any similar windows machine will easily last you your whole undergrad.,EngineeringStudents,d559fmv,1,t5_2sh0b

8292784,0,t3_4t1b6f,Ditch the idea of aeronautics vs. astronautics first of all. All undergrads have to learn the same crap anyway. Its even true for mechanical and civil engineering. All that stuff is related at the basic level. That means everything youll be learning will still be relevant to space applications. It might not be what youre exactly interested in or seem related but I guarantee you someone out there is doing it. Whether its fluids structures controls systems  knowing about these things is pretty applicationagnostic. There are actually many civil engineers who work in space structures. I was kind of surprised to meet so many but at the same time not really just because thats one of the main things civil engineers can do. Forces and vibrations dont change depending on the field. So basically people who pretty much didnt study anything about space in undergrad ended up working in space anyway.The point is in undergrad you are exposed a little bit about many different things.

8356727,0,t1_d5m4vx6,From reading what you said Id say your best fit is to drop the science major and do just civil engineering with a major. A lot of engineering students ive seen who double with science often just do it for interest  sometimes with the exception of physicsmaths because that can kind of help the degree and careers. However if you just see yourself doing science just for the curiosity and learning more about that field then go for it! a double degree may not boost your chances of getting civil engineering jobs anymore so than a normal CE degree but they are just good for learning more stuff. Physics on the other hand could be handy for research though. Yeah probably dont do economics and business its better to enjoy what you do at collegeuni.  Anyway thats just my  cents.

Mechanical modules where we studied kinetics kinematics statics and dynamics  and we used SolidWorks for designing models and Matlab for calculations and plotting them. Comp Sci module where we programmed in C an embedded system for a final project.If this sounds like something youre interested in then maybe its for you. I dont think an Engineering degree like this would exist if Industry didnt demand graduates with a skill set like this. This means youll be better suited for jobs that graduates in the fields composing Mechatronics wont be able to do as well as you and viceversa.Looking at job ads youll notice that a Mechatronics graduate might not use all of their skills learned at Unialthough this does happens for nearly every other degree out there AFAIK. Google MechatronicsRobotics jobs scroll to Job requirements and see for yourself.In conclusion if you Google enough you can find reasons to go for and not to go for such a degree but its not just a fancy name youll be training a skill in an interdisciplinary field meaning youll be trading breadth for depth in terms of knowledge in each one of the fields composing Mechatronicsalthough you wont stop learning after graduating.

Keep it all organized I highly recommend putting it all into a some sort of folder or binder. make color coded bookmarks as many as possible. do everything you can to minimize search time.you should still bring the big bookfolder just in case but if youve prepared properly you shouldnt even need to use it.BBring earplugs. because there will always be atleast one guy who does follow my previous advice and spends the entire exam turning over pages just frantically searching the book for something.,EngineeringStudents,d8vyned,1,t5_2sh0b

If you are required to pick a specialization then pick the most general one and go with that.  Recruiters wont even notice what you specialized in they only care about the BSEE itself and your work experience.  If you want to work in RF then try to get an RF related internship or coop.  That will take you much further than a degree specialization.Edit  Also classes that are more likely to help you land a job are obviously dependant on what job you are applying for.

9829460,0,t3_5g0j1y,th year ME... Here are the general academic tips I have or that I wish I had known when I started outShow up to class.  You will be amazed by how much material can be covered in a single class period.  Get in front of the material and stay in front of it at all costs.  If you start falling behind that gap will only widen as new material will depend on the old.  Do the damn homework.  Even if its not graded or not heavily weighted on the syllabus.  Its often the best way to prepare for the exam or to meter your proficiency in the subject.  Go to office hours and dont be embarrassed or self conscious about it.  I go to a huge school and its stunning how few people take advantage of office hours.  Any good professor can pick up immediately on what is holding up your understanding and correct it.  Not to mention the process of expressing your question often helps you clarify the material.  As an added bonus having a good rapport with professors can get you letters of recommendationleniency with deadlines etc.  Find or arrange a study group.  Ideally this is just some quiet place where engineering students regularly just show up to work on stuff or hang out.Find a note taking method that works for you and stick to it.  I generally have a binder and a big notebook for each class.  Lecture notes go in the notebook.  Homework reference sheets study guides and review problems go in the binder.  ,EngineeringStudents,daostio,2,t5_2sh0b

I just get the feeling that I dont want to do this anymore but I know I have to keep going otherwise my life will suck. Currently I take  credit hours   or  is minimum to keep scholarships at my school I think i have to take these hours cause some classes are prerequisites for upcoming classes and because the paradigm or curriculum for my major at my school dictates that I must take these courses. I would really like to graduate in  years cause I dont have money to pay for school outside of my  years.  Ive asked classmates if they want to be in a study group but they say no. I know its because they are smarter than me so they dont want to sit their and help me. Professors arent always helpful at my school. I attend a small university and so I dont have TAs.

10499810,0,t3_5qatqj,I graduated with a nuclear engineering degree in . I work for a company that manufactures radiation monitoring systems for nuclear power plants labs research facilities etc. If I were you I would major in ME and minor in NE if you have the option. Otherwise get a BS in ME with some extra physics maybe and an MS NE. The nuclear market is pretty stagnant in the US. I know a lot of people who couldnt find jobs. Others ended up in seminuclearrelated positions usually QA. I got my job in a large part because I knew the person working here before me from school. My position is multidisciplinary. I deal with a lot of electromechanical systems and fluids on top of radiation instrumentation. The other main bummer with an NE degree is youre limited to working in the boondocks in most cases. Very few nuke plants are near major cities and other jobs closer to cities are less common for people with just a BS. I personally feel like NE should be a grad level specialization  not an undergrad BS degree. ,EngineeringStudents,dcy9iwv,2,t5_2sh0b

10580692,0,t1_dd7a6vf,That raises a really great point.  Theres a noticeable gap between engineers and techs or people that have attended trade schools.  In my experience it really boils down to common courtesy.  Its important to remember that not everyone comes from a technical background and their input is just as valuable as yours.  People have really great ideas and should be given the time of day to discuss them.  For example I was working in the field on a set of gas turbines and some of the techs scoffed when I showed up.  And thats fine because were there to do a job and we dont have to be friends.  After working together for a few days it slowly came out that they think we are overpaid and cannot create a reliable product that doesnt need to be maintained as much as it is.  To deal with those accusations its important to acknowledge that youre working towards a common goal  creating and maintaining the product for the customer.  Not everything is going to be perfect and thats why there are maintenance techs.  If everything was perfect they wouldnt have a job.  Establishing common ground is a great way to diffuse an argument or a feeling of resentment.  Being able to be humbled is a very valuable trait too.  Assume that everyone knows as much as you and let them speak regardless of their position or title.  Ive had techs express concerns with clearances for tools so they can do their job with less hassle or in a more ergonomic manner.  And weve incorporated changes so that satisfies their request.  We cut weight and made their lives easier.  There will be things that you overlook and thats okay because eventually someone will catch it.  Its being able to be open minded and respectful towards someone that will separate you from the masses.And to people that say that its a waste of time and that manufacturing is the key Id just remind them that it is a team effort.  Manufacturing has a great deal of input on materials manufacturing methods and drawing generation.  But they might not be experts on assemblies stresses customer needs field changes retrofits or countless other factors.  Its like saying that a company doesnt need accountants because they have engineers that can do math.  There are a lot of moving parts to a company and belittling any branch or discipline is in bad taste.  If someone wants to live and die by manufacturing then they wont last long in industry.,EngineeringStudents,dd7bepi,7,t5_2sh0b

10975690,0,t3_5wp8d3,Ive done internships for two small companies and Ive gotten my hands on more relevant work than some of my friends who worked for large companies. Over the last summer I got to design many different machine parts from the ground up see them implemented on the manufacturing floor and was let loose to troubleshoot any issues by speaking with shop staff and other engineers. The small company size meant my scope of work was more broad more varied and ultimately I was given a lot of responsibility and plenty of room to be creative. On the contrary at a large company you could spend your entire  months tweaking the design of an ignition switch and typing up formal documentation. A.k.a. more red tape.My two cents take your chance with the small company. Ive done well at career fairs thanks to a resume packed with indepth engineering experience from my time at these places even though none of the companies are wellknown. I hope this helps.

No one from my graduating year did bar one girl who really really worked at it. Good for her but for the rest of us other ways of earning a living had to be sought.Cue roughly a decade in miserable dead end jobs and a long spell in a call centre. Ultra depressing.So Im now studying aerospace engineering. Im bored of my course too but itll open up so many doors it isnt even funny. Im just going to nut up and get through it. Even if I end up switching from aero to mech not much aero stuff in AU itll still be worth it. I too consider CS and whatnot as I can code and I dont mind sitting in front of computers all day. Its probably worth the feather in your cap.Basically arts kids are all cool and funky when your . Theyll be all broke and miserable by . The STEM kids are dorks at  but at  theyre earning serious money and can spend up on what they enjoy. Houses are bought. People have families. The comfortable middleclass lifestyle is gained. I have friends in both camps. The STEM guys are having a riot. The cool kids are hating life pretty hard these days. Some of them are going to have to make some very difficult decisions soon.

I started as a mechaninical engineering major in .  years of trying  years off and  year of failing here we are.  Im now an MET major mechanical engineering technology  of the same classes as ME but with a focus on manufacturing andor starting your own buisness.  My problem was never with engineering but with the draconian way math is taught at university. I have passed Thermo Fluids and Dynamics yet cannot get through Differential Equations all aforementioned had diff eq as a prereq got it changed to a coreq then still was not able to pass. I cannot remember  chapters worth of material with no notes or calculator. So last semester the choice came down to take diff again th? attempt with a tutor that would cost twice as much as the class or switch majors. Luckily MET counted almost everything as equivalent and Ive already completed all math requirements so Ill finally be done next spring...I dont know what to tell you other than this path is hard as hell and youre starting out at a disadvantage. If I honestly believed I could get a different degree that would end with a career I truly enjoyed I probably wouldnt be here.

Well for one IMO some of the lower level classes are poorly taught with professors who generally dont take them seriously.An exception to this would be ECE  and  who are taught be the Townsends Cecelia and Keith yes they are husband and wife. Cecelia is also the ECE advisor. But she does poorly at advising IMO and doesnt care as much.As far as  and  go to me they are fairly difficult.  more so than . It is the primary weed out class. Just remember that there is like no margin for error for fucking up on any exams. All exams are  exams in  hour. So you cant screw up on one. Of course there is partial credit but for some there really isnt much partial credit to get. Exams overall are like  of the grade! Its insane. I think she teaches the stuff very well. I havent taken the course with Keith but from what I heard he is also fairly good.As far as  goes IMO it is fairly easy. Its logic design as well as an assembly language called LC. Now LC isnt actually used in the industry however it is easier than lets say x or ARM assembly languages. So it is used as a teaching language.Learn it before going in. Its tricky since there arent too many resources to do things at the last minute. Here are some useful links...Simulator Manual LC to CYou will need that for ECE  too where you will learn C and how it relates to LC. When you take this class realize that the st test is mad easy while right after they bitch slap you. So learn C and LC very well. is fun IMO since you actually do breadboard projects. You will learn some verilog which is a hardware description language. But in that class you wont have to write verilog on the exams fortunately. You will have to though on the breadboard assignments.  is strictly a very mathy class. Its a diff eq class for ECE.Have you used NCSU gradient. If you havent then use it. Its your best friend.

He just needs to pick timing such as ms active ms inactive. Then just use crosscorrelation to detect when it first gets to each speaker and the ignore input for the next ms.. He might even be able to have synchronized timing between the two devices.Im not saying it is the best way to approach this but it is for sure a whole lot easier than computer vision.

I could probably throw a dart at the map and move wherever it lands and find a job.

11541247,0,t3_64nu2s,A lot of student jobs are mostly hurry up and wait. My coop is literally just me by myself most of the day working on all my own stuff. I have most of my work for a given month done within the first week I just have to wait a lot to get time to implement it in my devices. Its cool that Im trusted to work on my own on a few hundred million dollars in hardware but a lot of the time its just me sitting around staring at it.

11653444,0,t3_66ad4d,Depending on where your internship is do you know if you will be getting a site tour? If you will be doing a decent amount of walking through lab space or manufacturingproduction I would recommend wearing pants for safety and flatscomfy shoes for walking.If youre only going to be in an office for a standard facetoface interview then just wear professional attire. If you have a suit wear it. If you dont there are many other appropriate combinations. Dress  Blazer. Skirt  Blouse  Blazer. Slacks  Buttonup. If youre wearing a skirtdress I would recommend kneelength or longer. Heels are fine so long as they are standard pumps with a mid or low heel no stilettos with  heels or strappy sandals with a huge platform. Flats are good too. As BrassBells said no obnoxious colorspatterns. Stick with your solid blacks whites greys khakis and blues.Good luck!,EngineeringStudents,dggxkow,3,t5_2sh0b

11663780,0,t1_dghqd7g,Thats pretty impressive. My school technically doesnt have a college of engineering so you would have to transfer to an different school entirely to switch engineering fields. You also get booted out if you spend more than  semesters there too.So some people ended up getting jobs in startups as thats popular around that area and some went to gradmed school  continuing to bme vs. other fields.

11760118,0,t3_67swlj,What type of engineer interests you? Grad schools dont look at just your GPA. They look at your work experience GREs letters of Rex and personal statement. Also take the time to look into the research the professors are doing and reach out to them. I think I would have been accepted to more grad schools had I kissed ass. Sucks doing it but apparently it works. Look at TAMU UT Austin LSU Auburn Georgia Tech UF. Totally depends on what engineering program and also the type of research that captures your interest. ,EngineeringStudents,dgt1f29,2,t5_2sh0b
