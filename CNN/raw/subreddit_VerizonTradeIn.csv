3818725,0,t1_cqrk0ot,Absolutely. And i feel that they probably will make this right. Its unfortunate that this occurred in the first place. Im going to assume the best of them and go with system error but how i act in the future greatly depends on them making good.

3867804,0,t1_cqx3ipm,Walmart and Target will both price match if you have a physical flier. However for big ticket items they can be super picky. Both of them usually want to make sure that it is the EXACT SAME ITEM. They probably need manager approval. On the other hand at Best Buy the cashier just takes a look at the ad and adjusts the price. No manager no hassle.,VerizonTradeIn,cqx5w0y,1,t5_37z97

3959634,0,t1_cr6x2ez,In my case the received emails were for two zingers and the Glory.  The following day I received an email stating that the Blackberry was received.  I figure they scanned the phone and made the correction for the Blackberry.  Then the following day I got a confirmation letter and a GC for one Zinger at the exact same time and the confirmation and GC emails for the other Zinger should have been for the Glory  minutes later.  In all cases the GC confirmation and GC were issued at the exact same time or at least the emails were received by me at the same exact time.  From what i have been reading it is usually  hours or so before a GC is received after receiving the confirmation email.,VerizonTradeIn,cr7mqya,1,t5_37z97

3969541,0,t1_cr8rdah,Right something along those lines. I honestly think that if people sent in their shit by the cutoff that even if it goes past that they will get the credit. It just may take a little longer.While theyve offered BS deals like this in the past nothing has ever been this level of lucrative to go buy hundreds of phones.
