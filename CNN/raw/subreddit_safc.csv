219987,0,t1_cf3dlfm,If Altidore showed passion like Borini I think wed lay off him a bit just no effort sometimes He was much better the other day against Stoke though seemed to enjoy the battle first touch was better too. Ive defended him most of the season but its wearing a bit thin now.I think Scocco will get a run out last  minutes or so from what Ive seen he looks more like a Borini type full of running and shit.Said catts was injured for the Stoke game no approach was made from Stoke apparently if he goes no big loss for me like his heart even though it does rule his head at times.Win for us tomorrow Poyet is tactically better than prickface.

1177638,0,t3_27lxlu,I keep seeing this but I do not believe it in the slightest.What would we gain by sending him out on loan? I know there is a large amount of restructuring the wage bill from the crap weve brought in and some of the players that are on big money that arent worth it. However why would we loan out one of our better players from last season? I think we need to look at cover and other options for when he is being poor maybe use Mavrias or Karlsson as subs? but not get rid of him.,safc,ci23rj9,3,t5_2ski0
1256667,0,t1_ciaulex,De Fanti would have signed  Italian players by now.Its nice to have somebody who is well aware that the club needs to be overhauled gradually rather than trying to buy an entirely new squad every window.

8988198,0,t1_d7s8g72,Oh yeah.Even though Khazri had little to no impact and gave the ball away with a sloppy pass in our box I still think hes a starter and not a sub. He has stamina to last the game not run about for the last  minutes when were dead and buried anyway. Yet Moyes only sees the Khazri hes subbing on not the Khazri of last season.I think a lot of our issues will be solved when we have a second striker BoriniAnichebe and when Moyes finally trusts Khazri to start a game in AM. I have literally no idea why Pienarr started on the wing its almost like Moyes feels compelled to start Januzaj and doh we dont have another insideforwardwinger so well just chuck someone experienced in there... I guess we might see what changes he makes now he cant start Januzaj because hes banned for a match!,safc,d7s8rih,1,t5_2ski0
