Not to take anything away from you because i LOVE you and you are my FAVORITE artist you actually got me into producing but this is a good way to shed some light onto people automatically giving brownie points to brands that they love and peoples preconceptions of big names. Good on you sirEdit I sort of did this backwards too i hope you dont hate me. I didnt monitize it either But i made a house track and instead of posting it under my name and people giving it hate and critiquing as if they know any better it i posted is as Deadmau and instead of  likes  dislikes it is at about  likes and only one dislike right now with almost  views versus .

657205,0,t1_cgetlyy,In Vegas he played the first hour just awesome house music. Not deadmau but he was playing other peoples music and it was really really awesome.

661267,0,t1_cgffguw,So deadmau replaced avicii a few days ago as the mainstage closing act for day  of ultra miami. Halfway through his set he starts playing Animals by Martin Garrix the song everyone loves to hate because its so overplayed. Instead of the normal drop the melody is the tune of Old Macdonald had a farm and then he shouts out I fucking love this track. Next he plays Ghosts n stuff over a levels melody almost as funny as Animals. Then at the very end he goes to the front of the stage to thank the fans but needs to clear a big jump to get to a suitable platform. He jokes that its too long and hed soon be in a hospital bed next to afrojack and avicii before leaving the stage having not played strobe. And now hes retweeted worst closing set ever. Hope that helps clear it up a little,deadmau5,cgffp46,29,t5_2ru8s

1378517,0,t1_cip2nri,Good question. But this is the toughest to answer. This is where the matter of subjectivity of taste comes into play. But Ill try and answer this.Disclaimer  Everything Im going to write is highly subjective. There is no right or wrong in music. To help answer this question properly I am going to pin point some things in his pieces that to me sounded cringeworthy. But remember this is only my opinion.Having been trained in classical music I have been made to analyze of a lot of pianists and and have learnt a little bit of Indian classical music too. Now in Invida at  spotify Joel has thought of adding dissonance in the bass notes. Now here comes the subjective part. To me from the context of a pianist the moment I heard Invida I knew it wasnt composed by a pianist. I cant explain this to you but the skill choice of notes..everything was just shouting unskillness if that is a word?. So..when Joel put a dissonance in the bass notes Im like..what..why. To me it sounds fake and put on. Now there are more things I noticed while listening to the pieces but explaining everything will take a lot of time.for eg I remember there was a piece where all of sudden the bass note is struck with super high velocity..so I was like..wtf  But again this is highly subjective  I know I have pissed a lot on the pieces. But what keeps me addicted to Joel is feel. For eg In superbia I love the beginning motif. I wont call it a piano piece but I love the feel of it. For me its pop but who cares. So..for everyone who thinks I hate all piano pieces I dont. I just detest when he tries to fake it. I hope this explains at least  of my opinion. ,deadmau5,cip2zd4,1,t5_2ru8s

Synthetic Symphony has a fantastic bridge that just makes the song. Love Teaser Remix  Tiny Dancer is phenomenal and all the rest are just great.

2913935,0,t3_2ticeg,I paid via PayPal for a yearly membership on launch day. I was stunned to see that Upfront charged me for all of  without my permission by masking the yearly Paypal payment method as reoccurring.    I went into my Live.Deadmau.com settings ... Theres no way to turn it off there. I went into my Paypal settings and found that Upfront was an preauthorized autopay. Again this is all due to how they configured the yearly payment plans.    I filed a complaint with Paypal. During the complaint process. I made sure to point out the shady payment practice and the lack of controls on the mau website.  Paypal attempted to contact  Upfront  times and received no response. I was refunded  days later.    If you paid via credit card contact your customer service center and file a complaint. Cards backed by major banks will reverse the charge instantly.    Theres no tolerance in the banking industry for devious payment practices.,deadmau5,cnzblrv,7,t5_2ru8s

The Veldt Its a great song based on an amazing story.. Aural Psynapse In the same vain as There Might Be Coffee. Very relaxing and pleasant to listen to. Although I feel bad because I can never remember the exact pronunciation so I just end up calling it Anal Prolapse. Professional Griefers I followed this song from the start. Easily one of my favorites.. Brazil nd edit is rly good. Some Chords It was the first deadmau song I heard. Right This Second Those arps. Hnnnng!. Raise Your Weapon The first part only though.

6653728,0,t3_46mxg6,There are a lot of reasons this works in Joels favor. First he gets a continuous audio stream he would have wanted to do it through his Twitch stream but UMF wouldnt let him. The Megastructure is a far better stage sound wise and visual wise. It also allows him to do his own thing. Next Armin has the largest fan base of any artist right now. This is a good way to get out there and get people hyped the exact same way Eric did last year. Armin will also likely give him more than an hour.,deadmau5,d07jx7d,1,t5_2ru8s

8423854,0,t1_d5tv42x,what were you expecting for a  week budget? a  minute long AAA Unreal Engine powered experience?    Im not sure how informed you are on how much time and effort software deployment requires on certain tiers.  and for the tier we reached and the time and budget given i thought we did a great job.The thing to take away here is that we are taking the first steps into deploying VR media enriched experiences.... and this is how you start.  Sure if i had it my way and i had unlimited manhours and budgets id take the more than likely  to  years to develop a AAA experience.so its garbage you say.... thats fine i can totally accept your entitled i know nothing about project development opinion. Like i stressed in nearly every media outlet who inquired these are just some first dips into the world of development and deployment and Absolut was a great platform to utilize for both my benefit of getting it done and theirs to plug their brand and product.   Im not sure how that equates to selling out or brand whoring.... personally i think its smart business.... and thanks to this whole endeavour the door is now open to explore new ideas and pipelines to create better and more elaborate VR projects without walking in like a blind idiot.We chose to keep the platform mobile short and garbage as you put because believe it or not there is still a huge audience out there who have yet to experience VR in ANY capacity.... much less strapping on a vive and going full tilt with some GTX badassery. Accessibility was key in this project and we have attained that.  And we know that gap is closing fast and we will upscale to provide the highend user with something a lot more immersive creative and high end.... but when you start talking triple A.... you start talking s of thousands of manhours of work and development.... budgets in the s of millions and deployment schedules that require a WHOLE lot more than a  week turnaround.....but guess what?   well get there.... and well use the experience we gained from this project which is plenty more than the ZERO that would make an expensive pile o shit.at the end of this absolut project im just glad i could get my fans and followers a glimpse into our first steps into our vision. Thats ultimately what its all about and if thats something that can be discredited and berated as garbage... then i cant help you.,deadmau5,d5uiuqb,64,t5_2ru8s

10173519,0,t1_dbwwots,Are there not others struggling to make it big that would be more ready for this opportunity from you? Plenty of people have potential to be great producers several would also have production value that you dont think is garbage. And of those some would also be creative enough to make music that doesnt make myself and the guy above cringe. Of course that could just be us.. And I was going to leave it and assume the music just wasnt for me but I thought that you calling some of the production value garbage was odd. Plus you dont seem to like the style either. So why this guy? ,deadmau5,dbx83di,-4,t5_2ru8s

I went to Ultra and this blew some of their best acts out of the water.As for the meet and greet Joel is the most down to Earth guy. Someone who truly gives back to the fans.

11681810,0,t3_66p0sd,I guess it depends on what youre in the mood for x if you want something with more dancedubstep For Lack of a Better Name for more dance that has the traditional deadmau sound to it. Since you have stuff i used to do youll probably enjoy Get Scraped that was the first deadmau album released in  has a lot of the same genres as stuff i used to do theres actually a few songs on there that were also on Get Scraped so thats cool if you wanna hear the older versions of those songs. Other than that your options are WALBUM or Vexillology. The former was released in  obviously and while some disliked it me and other mau fans who enjoy some of his more experimental electronicdance got a kick out of it though not quite as much as whilelt. Vexillology on the other hand is a pretty old and obscure deadmau album that included some of his earliest dance tracks. I honestly wouldnt recommend that one not only because I like very few songs from it but also because it was released under Play Records who in a nutshell are kinda assholes to deadmau to this day. Anyway have fun exploring that music!EDIT Oh yeah there were also a bunch of singles hes released independently or on some of mautraps We Are Friends compilations. Some specific ones include HR  Cephei Polaris Your Ad Here Suckfest  and Saved.,deadmau5,dgk5eon,13,t5_2ru8s
