8288441,0,t1_d5df50g,Interesting ... Is anyone else having this problem? uogunther you bought Remove Ads right? Are they remaining hidden? They are still hidden on my device so Im not sure what the problem could be... Ill look into it. In the meantime try Restore Purchases again but wait like a minute before doing anything else... sometimes that feature takes a little while to connect with Apples servers or whatever...Sorry for this issue but thanks for playing and I hope you keep enjoying!,CCSpaceAge,d5dm48x,1,t5_3f4tk
