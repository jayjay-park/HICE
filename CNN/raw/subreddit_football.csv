575931,0,t3_20q452,Not a chance.Overpaid maybe but you have to consider the fact that players wages arent just about performance or recent form.  Rooney has proven himself very consistent over the course of each season and perhaps more importantly from a monetary standpoint he adds a great deal of value to the Manchester United brand.   Being a globally recognized name that even people who dont follow football or the EPL know and having that name so synonymous with United is worth a lot money if you look at it from inside the United marketing department.   Losing him would be more than just losing his goals and assists it would be losing a huge part of their identity and would be perceived as a sign of weakness as he is their last remaining talisman and still has at least  or  years of peak physical ability left.But thats not to say his numbers arent still well above average theyre putting him into the record books for at least the next few decades.Hes recently just become the first PL player not just forward in PL history to reach  seasons with double digit assists and goals in a season CantonaLampard  Drogba  Bergkamp  and hes well on track to get the  remaining goals he needs to pass Charlton as the number one goal scorer for the most successful club in PL history.  On their own those two stats say a lot about his consistency and ability.He certainly has his dips in form where he can seem non existent for up to weeks at a time and he doesnt lead the golden boot race on a yearly basis but that cant make him the most overrated player in PL history.   Is he on the MessiRonaldoIbra level of forwards in terms of ability? Probably not probably a tad below IMO but hes proven to be incredibly consistent at maintaing great overall attacking numbers over the long term. Also this article is a pretty awful piece of journalism as it clearly has a conclusion going into it and looks at the stats to try and weave them into that idea rather than the other way around.,football,cg5qkoo,22,t5_2qkr5

3154351,0,t1_coowq0g,By the law of the game the ball has to be taken where the foul occurred. But I would say moving the ball about a foot from the spot is considered trifling so no one would really care. Also just saying as an observation if youre thinking about shooting the ball moving the ball forward isnt really gaining an advantage most of the time. The wall is still ten yards away from where the ball should have been spotted and let say u move is forward by  yards now you only have  yards to get the ball up and over the wall which personally I feel you just made the shot harder for yourself.,football,cooy30o,2,t5_2qkr5

Teams like maccabi Brooklyn were dominant powerhouses of their own right. It wasnt until the massive economic shocks of the s that the league dissipated entirely not due to racism.

3969595,0,t3_35xa8y,I did this March  and its easy enough through their club sites. For the Anderlecht game I emailed the club as they only would issue tickets by post.  The club reserved a seat for me and I just collected it before the match. I then went down to Cologne and went and watched FC Koln then the next day I saw Bayer Leverkussen.  Those were the easiest tickets as you printed them out on your own computer.  Next week I am going to Copenhagen and Im using the same format for the tickets.  Email with queries and if they have to post the ticket I will ask to pick it up at the ground.  Any questions let me know and Ill try and answer them.  Ive been to a few European stadiums and you can generally buy the tickets on the day  if you want to chance it. Use the trains to get about  they are all good  especially the intercity ones between France  Belgium  Germany. ,football,cr8rmkr,0,t5_2qkr5

Note how every time the ball is lost especially in the final third and midfield the opposing player is swarmed by  Liverpool players in an attempt to get the ball back up to the striker ASAP. Essentially countering the counter attack.Jurgen also plays  up front  of the time. These  players routinely rotate and switch positions throughout the gameA. To confuse and overwhelm the opposition defenders.B.

11535282,0,t3_64lzyp,I used to play left forward and speed was always one of my strong suits. I know a few things that help increase your speed. .  Sprints sprinting is probably the most effective way to increase speed. If you have access to a track try doing pyramid work. Sprint  jog  sprint  jog  up to  then work your way back down. . Squats hit the weight room increase your squat strength. The more you can squat the faster youll be for the most part. Increasing your squat is an extremely effective way to get faster hit the weight room x a week for squats. Do  to  sets of  reps increasing your weight as often as you can squatting ass to grass. Check rfitness for help. . Ladders get yourself a set of ladders and get out and do those. Ladders help with footwork and changing speed. I cant remember my workout from when I used to play but Im sure the Internet has a bunch of great ones you can do. Try doing these before sprinting and after your squats if your gym has turf or the sorts. Getting faster takes time and effort. You shouldnt expect results immediately. You should do your sprints and squats x a week each on different days with ladders before sprints to warm up and after squats to work on your endurance. Make sure you get enough rest and dont overtrain. Give yourself  days of rest between squat sessions and at least  days before a game.If you need help with anything else feel free to reply or pm me Im more than willing to help you out if I can. ,football,dg3iyps,4,t5_2qkr5
