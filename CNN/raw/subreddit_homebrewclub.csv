Haciendo un gran ruido y a una impresionante velocidad las luces cegadoras abducen a los indefensos uno a uno desafiando todo lo que los residentes conocan hasta ahora.

By  the film rights were acquired by Columbia Pictures who did not move the project beyond development. A scene in which Craig s character rides a horse alongside a ravine and jumps down it onto a spacecraft emulated many scenes in American Western films where cowboys rode along a moving train and jumped on it.The citizens have intended to reconstruct the town with the expectation that the newly revealed gold mine will soon bring many new settlers. At the end of the film Jake kindly rejects Dolarhyde s offer to help reconstruct the town and rides away. Daniel Craig as Jake Lonergan an amnesiac outlaw. Harrison Ford as Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde a powerful cattleman. Olivia Wilde as Ella Swenson a mysterious traveler who aids Lonergan.If you do it right it honors both and it becomes interesting and clever and a reinvention of two things that people understand the conventions of instead of just a retread or remake or sequel or reboot of a film you ve seen before. The film is considered to be a financial disappointment narrowly grossing its budget back. The use of anamorphic widescreen rather than shooting fullframe flat and cropping later gave ILM no extra room to reframe shots it was a challenge to show both ninefoottall aliens and smaller humans in the same space. In  the LA Times listed the film as one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.You kind of swing back and forth between the two extremes and the tone until you find the exact right point where a Western and a scifi movie can really shake hands without it seeming unnatural. Imagine you re watching Unforgiven and then Aliens land Orci explained. Orci also said The comic has the themes of enemies uniting to fight a common enemy and has the setting of that specific time period so we kept the inspiration from all of that. In terms of the specifics of the story and who these characters are we wanted the audience to be surprised and to not feel like they ve already seen everything if they were fans of the comic.The character of Meacham also presents an unconventional take on Christian principles to support the film s main theme of redemption. According to Favreau Meacham s teaching Doc how to shoot not only references similar scenes in other Westerns but also teaches him how to be a person. Meacham s dying words to Jake God don t care who you were Son only who you are  speaks of the central theme of redemption. The hummingbird that Jake sees at various points in the film is a good spirit that could represent either Alice or Ella an alternate theory is that Ella was an angel that helped Jake get over Alice..   ,homebrewclub,cx1tyxj,1,t5_2xdb0
