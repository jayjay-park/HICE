10219614,0,t1_dc23fxj,Youve had yours since ?! Wow I got mine done in December  And I am already worried about needing another. I have this weird fear it is just going to stop working on some random afternoon. The recovery and the process was so different than open heart that I feel like it didnt do anything.,chd,dc2g8nx,1,t5_2v77j

Depending on the elevation you live at you will notice that she tires quicker than other kids. Dont sweat it she will self regulate. Im not going to lie to you sitting in the room waiting for updates from the OR nurse is the worst thing ever. But these cats are professionals. They are the best and will take care of your girl. We go in for our Fontan in a month and a half. Recovery time for that seems to run a little less than for the Glenn. As a single ventricle patient your daughter and mine will always be candidates for heart transplant. You will be told about how she may need one by the time shes an early teen or before. What you wont be told is that there are lots of kids who have made it to their s so far.For reference and to give you a sense of normalcy my daughter is in a normal daycare and does ballet for an hour every week. You will just have to find her version of normal. From one parent to another stay strong and dont let her run you ragged when shes on her feet. ,chd,dg8ph83,2,t5_2v77j
