2592226,0,t3_2onc56, One of the perks of watching Homicide in its intended order is that Kays breakdown makes much more sense following directly after Crosettis suicide. Feltons monologue nails a lot of the popular discourse on crime these days and then too I suppose. Namely that only the loss of worthwhile life is a concern. This episode surely makes Homicide one of the first TV shows to show the angry white man. An interesting quote from Bayliss I live to make Frank happy. The repetition of the brain tumor line is an effective way to show the different sensibilities of Kays family and her work family. The direction of the scene at the dinner table makes it pretty clear that Chick was a part of the murder. Kay for once chooses not to press the issue revealing her feelings for Chick. Its incredibly ironic and telling that Chris who is unemployed yells at his wife for not washing his bloody clothes. Its especially ironic because he calls it her job even though she has a job. One key takeaway that is subtly illustrated in this episode people are the same all over. Raining in Baltimore aside this is  of Homicides best episodes. Its also one of the best looks at the life of a detective that well get on Homicide.,Homicide_LOTS,cmwxw47,1,t5_31xt9
