1232156,0,t1_ci87j03,Well kinda sorta?  The kiss was kinda... well... yeah.  I would honestly recommend watching the TV series if you have a chance before watching the films  the films are more fun that way and the way Shinji and Kaworus relationship plays out kinda sets you up for the Rebuild timeline.  But seriously Gainaxkara is insane.  Some of the games these are official BTW most with full voice acting with the original cast have shit likeShinji is forced to dress up like his mom for Fuyutsuki  Ritsuko molests Shinji offcamera and Gendo ONcamera  Kaworu and Shinji elope somewhere  Shinji becomes a master detective and has to be defense attorney to Kaworus prosecution in cases of schoolgirls with really long arms I DONT EVEN KNOW  etc etc  Soak in the Eva crack let it seep into you ,yaoi,ci88gid,2,t5_2qxif

So she basically hated him oh and was also a prostitute and one night one of her clients cut her and left this is when he was like idk ? and his mom tried to get him to call the cops but instead he sat there and watched her die. Then he became a teacherslash serial murderer of prostitutes and one day meets this male prostitute... story does not get brighter from there but I fucking loved it all the way til the end.

Im the kind that doesnt wanna squee everywhere and call my friends waifu....But Im not bashing it. Its good for some not for others. Otherwise Id look up stores that cater to people who play overly complicated board games. For instance theres a store here that isnt at all anime but is like half manga. They have a yaoi section on their bottom shelves here. Comic book stores dont advertise that they have yaoi but normally they do just because. Barnes amp Noble also has yaoi but Id look up if what you want is at the store first if I were you.Im a huge DampD fan and Im really into magic and such so visiting those kind of stores I frequently see manga in the more book focused stores. Just explore your options you know?I recently discovered Tomoko Yamashita from picking up one of her books at this past con and if you dont like the usual fluffy and good ending stuff Id suggest her. She does some yaoi that I dont see often being that it doesnt necessarily end fluffu fluffu. Real life sorta things.,yaoi,cuv82lq,1,t5_2qxif

10636229,0,t3_5rs0zn,Well I can give you a list of what came to mind when you said action yaoi though I havent seen Hai to Gensou no Grimgar and dont know what its about. There arent very many yaoi anime let alone good yaoi anime but I tried.  Maiden Rose  This is about the love affair between an army captain and his subordinate. Its based off of part of a very long manga series. Their relationship started off consensual and became nonconsensual so there is some pretty heavy rape in this one.  A Foreign Love Affair  About the affair between a ships captain and the head of a yakuza family. Not as much action as you would expect from a series with this premise but its there. There is some noncon between one of the main characters and a side character FYI. Honestly a lot of the yaoi adapted to anime have some. Idk why.  Ai no Kusabi  About the relationship between an elite and his slave. I dont care for rapetolovestories or just plain rape stories without romance so I wasnt a fan. There are two versions one that came out in the s and one that came out in . I watched the unfinished  series.  Fuyu no Semi  I havent seen this one so I cant really speak for it but it seemed like it might fit your action requirement. The reviews were good.  Finder  Lots of rape I was not a fan. Plus its animix not anime if you dont know what that means then watch a few seconds of this youll understand. But its definitely actiony.   Earthian  forbidden love affair between two angels. Chihaya kind of looks like a girl though so it might not be your thing. I read the manga I dont think the anime gets to the part where they have sex if thats what you want. This is shounenai not yaoi which means they dont actually do the deed. The manga is yaoi.  Fake  about the romance between two NY city cops. The anime is terrible compared to the manga which is one of my alltime favorites. The manga is yaoi the anime is shounenai. Definitely an action series.  This Boy is a Professional Wizard  main character is a wizard who works for the government in the police division. Not much action but I thought it was very good regardless.  Spiritpact  currently airing on Crunchyroll. About an exorcist and a ghost who make a contract together. Its too early to say if the hints at romance actually lead anywhere but there are very obvious yaoi undertones. The first episode is the worst of any anime Ive ever seen. The second and so on episodes improve just slightly. Id give it at least  episodes to see if you want to watch it.  Loveless  havent seen it. Its shounenai not yaoi. Araiso Private High School and Wild Adapter  these two have the same characters but in separate storylines. The Wild adapter manga is also one of my favorites  the art is stunning the story entrapping and Id absolutely recommend it. This would be what I think youre looking for except that theres no romance. Technically theyre listed under the shounen ai category but Im not sure I agree. However upon watchingreading it its easy to see why. This is a story between two characters who are each each others most important person romantically or no. Id try it.  Legend of the Blue Wolves  I havent seen it and Im not sure what its about but I know it has both action and yaoi. So. Yeah. I hope you find something to watch! If youre open to manga then I would suggest Fake Wild Adapter Yellow Innocent Bird Asterisk A Night of a Thousand Dreams art is meh but story is great Blood Bank Konya mo Nemurenai the webcomic Breaks and the one piece Zorro x Sanji Bokyaku Countdown and Pirate Ship Noah. You dont have to know anything about One Piece to enjoy these just read a general description of the plot and youre good to go. ,yaoi,ddd1nee,2,t5_2qxif
