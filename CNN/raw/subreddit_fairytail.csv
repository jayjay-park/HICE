1380574,0,t1_cip7flu,I totally agree that celestial spirit magic is awesome and very strong just not that it is right now. The spirits power doesnt grow noticeably even though they are supposed to get stronger with lucy there power level doesnt feel like its rising due to same spell set and obvious weaknesses The whip is an item not magic even though obtained from virgo and urano metria is no spirit magic and a normal celestial wizard would never be able to learn it.  Lucy seems super weak right now even though she is one  if not the wizard with the most potential she could easily fight all demons. The spirits are very versatile but only a few are strong virgo only kept up with her she could kick her away when lamy was fawning over one of the guys and lamy was already injured we also never really saw her strengths so she might be the weakest demon.  We also know that virgos fighting capabilities are abysmal she only picked up actually fighting not so long ago maybe due to lucy getting stronger and only offered her dance to help when lucy needed her once. The only fighting spirits she has are taurus leo and aquarius she broke aquarius already leo is strong but cant overpower the demons and taurus is slow and actually pretty weak he is distracted and fooled easily and gets overpowered way too easily.     Yukino is a super bad celestial wizard and her spirits are weak as well many wizards can counter her gravity magic libras for example gerard with his high speed magic erza with her armors and every ranged wizard with simply attacking with spells instead of trying to move the snake might actually be strong but against Kagura we were not able to see it Pisces could be strong also lacks material.     The most interesting thing is now the collarbone tatoo of lucy which could have aquarius power for lucy to activate.     Also I never compared yukino to kagura and jellal I even said it was kinda obvious shes lose to Kagura because of how insanely strong she is   gtYukino while a top magician from her guild was super weak. Not even because she fought Kagura but because what her spirits did.    As I said she is supposed to be top magician but she was weak emotionally and only  gold keys is kinda weak which also means there cant be any celestial mage anymore except a new key category is introduced because of lucy and yukino possessing every single gold key. You even said yourself a celestial wizard is strong because of versatility and yukino had two only strength spirits and one utility spirit which sucks against what Lucy can do so yes yukino is weak even without comparing her to jellal and kagura.      So what I am actually saying is that I do completely agree with you and your opinion is not greatly different than mine because Lucys abilities are insane but the author makes her plain bad for the plot one of the best examples is her tournament fight where the dark guild sucked her magic away so she couldnt blast her enemy away with UM she always seems to just lose because it fits the plot and Natsu can safe her while theoretically she could take them all at least after she got the second container and could use UM with gemini.      I actually forgot sagittarius capricorn and cancer but she stopped using cancer to fight never used capricorn and sagittarius can only shoot arrows which kinda sucks against most opponents,fairytail,cipc8co,1,t5_2s9z2

1648337,0,t3_2d3ygg,My favorite arc would have to be the Oracieon Seis arc. Besides some niggling plot inconsistencies it had good pacing kick ass fight scenes and I found the plot really interesting with the wishes and such. And it seems like Im one of few but Zero is my favorite arc final boss as I call them so far. Once unleashed he was evil just to be evil and relished every second of it.Least favorite arc gotta be Key of the starry skies. Besides the plodding pace the rest of it was okay to me some of it I even liked. The Jiggle Butt Gang got a laugh out of me like once or twice call me immature but when they one shot Erza with a point blank butt buster attack I genuinely laughed out loud. Some fight scenes were cool like Mirajane vs Racer and Erza vs Cobra second fight. But what was unforgivable to me was the final fight against Midnight as it devolved into a slideshow with voice over. Stuff like that in an anime is so boring to watch and it ruined for me what should have been a climatic showdown.,fairytail,cjmxpsn,3,t5_2s9z2

2935291,0,t3_2trs0j,Loke is actually really strong. Theres a reason why Gray wanted him as a partner in the Sclasstrials.And although they were at a disadvantageBickslow having an near infinite supply of dolls Loke Lucy and Happy defeated Bickslow.In Tartaros he even holds his own against base Torafusa. That would put him on the same level as base Gajeel. Hell if it hadnt been for Jackal and Lamy theres even a chance he could have won.mangaAnd although it isnt cannon Eclipsed Loke gave Natsu a really hard time.Capricorn hasnt been shown much but he seems comparable to Loke.Taurus is supposed to be a powerhouse but he is generally defeated really easy.Saggitarius is a master archer and although not fast or anything he does have his uses from time to time.And then theres Aquarius. She has on more than one occasion turned the battle around for Lucy. Even with enough power to fight Juvia to a draw. And she keept Jackal at bay for a surprising amount of time considering she was quite wounded.mangaAlthough the spirits arent amazingly powerful compared to Natsu or Erza and especially not Gildarts it is the fact that Lucy can summon multiple spirits that make a difference. She even manages to hold off several fodder members of Tartaros and Lamy Jackal and Torafusaalthough none of them were in demon form. And the spirit king is the only one besides Graywith his devil slaying magic and Zeref to do serious damage to Mard Geer. Even Natsu in LFdragon mode and a unison raid from the twin dragons didnt even scratch him but the spirit king not only fought an even match with Mard Geeralthough not in demon form he even disspelled Alegria.

3633760,0,t1_cq6g16y,This is all just speculation on my part so I have no doubt that what you are saying is true. But isnt that anime referencing the Tenrou event which is quite long ago even in anime terms. Like in the GMG Natsu stood against two rd gen dragon slayers in dragon force  unison raid. And they kind of stress throughout how ridiculous unison raid is. And Rouge made that comment about how Natsu wasnt even using his lightning flame power. And unless I am mistaken Natsu wasnt in Dragon Force himself?  I just cant shake the feeling that a fullpowered angry emotional Natsu in Dragon Force could at least stand up to Gildarts full power As opposed to trembling in fear. We have never seen anything like this before so surely we cant say no? But like I said this is a purely speculative thread ,fairytail,cq6h5fx,1,t5_2s9z2

Not Zeref and especially NOT END unless youre reading a different version of Fairy Tail the fandom isnt. Keith was the one who turned Silver into a demon and the only people who knew was Keith and Juvia. Gray never did show revenge because he didnt know the whole storyGrays pursuit of END is similar to Sasukes pursuit of Itachi false again. Gray is pursuing END because of his fathers wish since he failed to do so himself its just a similar as Igneel wanting Natsu to do the exact same thing.

For Dragonification my idea is it works like Naruto where if you go full Kyuubi and turn into Nine Tails you get really strong but is bad for you but the Dragon Slayers will learn to control it like Naruto did and turn into the Nine Tails Chakra where you get the power of the Nine Tails yet youre still in full control and you dont go berserk. ,fairytail,crdr7xr,1,t5_2s9z2

I never took Atlas Flames words as Igneel wouldnt kill E.N.D but rather he truly couldnt. At least at the beginning of the fight. Im not against the theory that at some point E.N.D became a small little child again at some point and then Igneel decided he wouldnt kill him.

4285412,0,t3_3a2jrb,Precht is too high. Sure he was a super powerful foe but hes not above Mard. Also it was heavily suggested that he actually wasnt close to finding the source of all magic at all.Also Im a bit conflicted about Natsu and Erza. We obviously know that Erza would win against Natsu no questions asked. However that would be a friendly fight. So far Natsu has been much more powerful when he fought against actual enemies when he developed many emotions to gain strength from. In these cases I actually found him to be stronger than Erza.You should probably make it more clear if youre refering to powerfullness or to strength. The most prominent example would be Warrod. When talking about strength he definitely has no place on this list. Talking about powerfullness however hes a very big character. I dont equalize strength and powerfullness since powerfullness can mean so much more than just strength. Going back to Erza vs. Natsu Id rank Natsu higher if were talking about strength but Id place him lower if were talking about powerfullness because Erza can just adapt so much better.Id place Bacchus somewhere around . And Id swap Sting and Rios.You sure you wanna include Dragons?edit Forgot Juvia. Needs to be much higher. She actually has one of the most powerful magics weve seen so far. Lets take a short look at whos currently ranked above her whom she could beat Midnight Jiemma? dont know the exact magic Ivan Sting Rogue Torafusa Gajeel Warrod Natsu? Jura. Why? They could hardly even damage her water body. Ive experienced again and again that she has been matched just against those foes that counter out her water body thinking that she would easily have won against other guys from the bad team. Juvia appears to be weaker than she is because having opponents that counter her water body is necessary for her fights to be interesting.,fairytail,cs8opwp,10,t5_2s9z2
4289485,0,t1_cs94nho,This was WWI. By  the warcrazed Imperial Germans aggressively sought to monopolize the transAtlantic shipping lanes through unrestricted submarine warfare they declared all waters surrounding Great Britain as war zones and openly threatened to destroy any vessel bearing the flag of Great Britain or any of her allies including the U.S. Lusitania was en route to Liverpool from New York carrying  American passengers. The Germans believed she was carrying war contraband turns out she actually was thus rationalizing that they could destroy the ship they deemed a threat they had already declared war on Britain anyway.  In the long run the deaths of American passengers prompted Congress to begin pressuring Wilson to declare war on Germany. We didnt join the game until .To answer your question I dont think the Germans ever promised to cease unrestricted submarine warfare their Atlantic campaign was far too aggressive. They sunk anything that moved. It would make sense if Wilson believed them owing to his stubborn stance on staying out of the war. Not sure if Lusitania was the first.Edit TLDR WWI Germans would destroy anything that moved in the Altantic no restrictions.

His strengthability to send Natsu and massive creatures flying and destroy mountains with one punch combined with that is too dangerous. His durabilitysurvived Natsus finishing move without a scratch and only got pushed back a little is also very large. He can nullify magic. All of that leads to him not losing to Natsu. How does Natsu even have a chance at winning? Hes outclassed in everything but range and even then range is useless. Natsu has no chance. ,fairytail,csfxj0j,2,t5_2s9z2

4430452,1,t1_csp13us,Actually he was stopped by Gray. He was out of the fight before he was killed. Hades is also durable. Theyve both hardly recieved any damage from any attacks at all. Hades Heart was destroyed which then sucked up all of his magic power. It also removed his pretty much invincibility. He was then attacked by the entirety of Team Natsu plus a headbutt from Laxus after they got a magic power boost and he still remained conscious.      So saying that either of these people win just based solely off of durability is kind of silly imo because theyre both extremely durable. ,fairytail,csp5byx,0,t5_2s9z2
4431939,0,t1_csoxmt0,XD Im new to this sub so this is probably the worst way to start but I find fairy tail is the only anime I cant watch the sub of which I started dub I half converted a couple of months back  now I watch both sub and dub and I have gone back and re watched many series but I found with fairy tail in the sub the voices where so weird and just felt wrong I had already seen up to  so yeh I was pretty dedicated but I tried to keep and open mind but I felt with fairy tail the whole style of the show gets me so immersed and into the story like I lose myself within it and that change to sub almost ruins it for me and takes away what makes fairy tail so special to me my immersion for example my complete excitement during episodes not just cuts of an episode but because of the event within all in all I find it a great escape.Just expressing my opinion and maybe helping some see why its so hard to convert one way or another I suspect if youre as into the series as I and I know some of you are it would be the same for sub to dub.

4467546,0,t3_3cavqr,I dont actually think they are weaker than that subordinate his magic was just very hard to fight against he took Lucy and Erza out of the battle straight away because they couldnt use their magic then Gray and Natsu were having trouble because he was able to just zip around all over the place and they couldnt really land a hit on him. If one of the Spriggan  hadnt shown up though I think Natsu and Gray would have beaten him it would have just taken them a bit to get use to his magic. In saying that he probs is quite powerful himself but I think if Natsu or Gray got a solid hit on him it would fair mess him up. Acnologia and Zeref are quite likely leagues above the Spriggan  aswell. With maybe Acnologias human form being weaker or equal to them. ,fairytail,cstt68p,4,t5_2s9z2

4710534,0,t3_3f86kc,For the most part Lucys Urano Metric and Jellal magic heavenly body magic inbodies the same type of magic. Grand chariot is composed of seven stars while Lucys Urano Metric is composed of billions of stars existing within the  constellations which is why it is the ultimate magic of the stars. Each controls a different amount of stars. Heavenly body magic also controls meteors. Fairy glitter is different from the two. Now Fairy glitter is more like Galaxies blade in which it concentrates light to attack the opponent. The difference is Fairy glitter doesnt just get light from the Stars but also the moon. While Galaxies blade create an infinite amount of light from the stars attacking the opponent. The fairy magics are just already existing magic that was given the name Fairy something. We know Fairy law was something that already existing and it was just called law meaning anyone can do it. ,fairytail,ctoausj,1,t5_2s9z2

4839471,0,t3_3h61tg,I think that Zeref made a massive amount of demons so he would have the best chance of dying to one of them but I imagine there is a large scale in difference between some demons and others. On the scale Lullaby was probably one of the weakest and could kill humans with no problem but still couldnt kill Zeref. I mean look at tartaros. Very strong but they had to do this MASSIVE plan that took forever to enact just to try and get rid of magic. The magic that keeps Zeref alive is far stronger than anything else weve witnessed in the series so far. Some demons must have a easier tome killing than others but some must still suck. I mean a large chunk have been beaten by humans. These guys were created by Zeref. If they could be defeated by humans than they stood no chance at ever killing Zeref.TLDR Lullaby is a weak bitch,fairytail,cu4jxo2,1,t5_2s9z2

4917480,0,t3_3i8v2w,Gray could probably just freeze him and instantly win.     Lets say that doesnt happen. Gray has been shown to beat enemies he literally shouldnt have any chance against because of how tactical he is. He wins with intelligence more often than not. I have no doubt Gray would take advantage of the Dragon Slayers weakness of motion sickness. He also has pretty good scale now and has much tougher ice than before. Until I see Gajeel enter DF at will and absolutely shred through enemies I dont think he could win. Grays taken beatings before and still fought. More feats are necessary before an accurate winner can be chosen.   Pretimeskip I think Gray definitely wins. Instant freeze along with smarts and high offensive power beat Gajeels steel and shadows.    Edit Gajeel in shadow form cant hit Gray either and Ice Clones are a thing to trick his opponent into making an opening. If anything its more dangerous for Gajeel to go into shadow form constantly Gray could take advantage of it very easily depending on the frequency of its use. ,fairytail,cuedx21,5,t5_2s9z2

5547273,0,t1_cwkjx99,Just like it was never officially stated Lucy and Yukino are the only celestial spirit mages left. Yukno said maybe and Yukino can only go only off what she has seen. No way Yukino could know how many Celestial mates if left. I doubt she even knew Angel was a celestial spirit mage. Also the Eclipse gate was based off of the Zodiac keys beacsue the Zodiac keys also represents planets. Even then though Huisi even admitted she was planning on using Pseudo magic to open it. The eclipse gate was forged seven years prior to Lucys return to Tenriu island. Their rarity is noted by the number of people who practice the magic. Only  if the world is mages. There is over  different types of magic out their and yet everyone doesnt practice the same type of magic. Your argument of saying since not that many CS mages are left that Silver keys are weaker then Gold keys. Also Aries never fought a Tarturous member she along with Taurus performed an attacked that both Tarturous members escaped. Also are you suggesting that if Aries caught Leo off guard she would be able to defeat him? No she wouldnt. Each Celestial spirit has their own specialty.Leo is great in CQC combat but would lose in long range combat.Aries is good for defense but horrible for offense.Scorpio and Aquarius is good for large range attacks but lacks CQC skills.Taurus is good for brute strength but lacks mle skills.Horologium is great for defense the best spirit in that area but lacks offense just like Aries.Caleum is great for offense because as a sword it could send people flying or as a cannon it could blow holes through people. ,fairytail,cwkouy2,1,t5_2s9z2

Valkyries?O Thats amazing...NOW I WANNA SEE KAGURA amp ERZA VS DIMARIA MORE!!!!Hmm youre right about Mest i forgot that teleporting thing...so Marin might be more OP since his ability can activate without warning right?Evergreen also beat RustyRose for a minute with her Stone Eyes so something like that? Hmm it is a fair point i guess wait the Sitri part was filler? The part where she one shotted Jenny i mean...You are right about Elfmans punches being stopped by Satan Soul but remember after Tenrou they each went through training? Thats how Elfman was able to get LizardManthe one he used to beat Bacchus and also the Cheetah one...so he could have powered up his basic Beast Soul form he was able to take down one of the Sclass Element Four in that form seven years ago so with more training i think being able to take down one of the Nine Demon Gates does it make sense this way? Mira was using Sitri against Seilah and yes its stronger than her base form...It shot you up the feels? xD At first i remember being angry since i thought Seilah was taken down too easily and Mira is stronger than ElfMan so that shouldnt have happened but when i rewatched the fight it made sense still sad that my favorite Etherious lost so early in the arc but her ability was pretty hax so well it made sense being beaten among the first onesNatsu amp Gray vs Mard Geer and Natsu Sting amp Rogue vs Mard Geer are up there in my favorite fights in the entirety of the series part of the reason i love Tartaros so much is that Mard Geer is the first major antagonist that was there from the beginning of the arc till the end Zero and Hades appeared sparingly in the middle of the arc and at the end finally but Mard was there from top to bottomOh youre welcome Hmm can you resend me a link for the Connections post btw?

6012223,0,t3_3xqoym,This is a cool idea. However i think there should be more roles tbh. There should be a Niche option for ones selected for only a very specific part of their magic and i could always use one more support type. Anyways onto my teamTeam Pokemon due to Pokemon being the inspirationLeader August  He seems to be a very capable mage while being able to utilize many strong magics. However since he was only shown putting up a shield against Laxuss attack i wont demand too much on him. His role would be to think up strategies give out orders and using defensive spells for his team when needed.Second in command Freed  He is a very calm and capable person with enough dedication for his leader and qualities to be in command. Freed was also chosen for the usefulness of his magic Runes which can be used to trap enemies damage them without confrontations put up barriers enhance a persons prowess scout for the opponents powers and reflect attacks back at them although the final one is anime only. The very nature of his magic blends well with Augusts intellect and creates many possibilities of strategies.Support Wendy  Pretty much selfexplanatory. I hesitated a bit between her and Chelia but Wendys magic is more vast and she can support her team both defensively and offensively while healing and increasing their stats.Tank Laxus  He is quite popular for this role and for a good reason. Laxus is durable strong fast and has a hold of Fairy Law which is always a safe last resort. There is also a small chance of Wendy consuming part of his magic to gain a power boost i wouldnt count on it though. He also pairs well with Freed in that he can attack multiple targets at once with his lightning while Freed traps the enemy. And of course August is almost certain to know some spells that can generate lightning so Laxus should not worry about running out of strength either. He is also one of the speedier ones of my team.Long range Midnight  If there were a niche category he would definitely be in it. The main reason i chose him was not for his attack prowess but his utility. His reflector allows him to deflect and send back enemys attacks when combined with August and Freeds barriers makes for a nice combo both offensively and defensively. Not only that he can also create illusions giving Laxus time to cast Fairy Law or any other member to charge up their attacks. Last but not least Macbeth also learned Genesis Zero which is also a sure kill in itself. Another small niche is that he can turn himself and his teammates invisible by reflecting light away which can be more useful than illusions in certain cases.Close combat Brandish  My first choice for this role since her magic is so good at it. When the enemy is far away they are forced to use nonliving things to attack and get reflected by Midnight wasting their own magic and advantages. When they are close by Brandish can easily shrink them making the threats nonlethal anymore. Her magic is also good for clearing out the landscapes allowing Midnight to easily locate and reflect attacks which is more limited if they are in a city or so.Aerial Acnologia  No explanation needed. My team is a little bit weak to strong attacks that come from above so Acnologia is here to take care of that while wiping out the enemy with his breath note Freed might already trap them in his Runes so avoiding an island buster move like that should be nearly impossible. Acnologia is also extremely fast which is always nice since my team has only Laxus as a speed type.Meat shield Zeref  Not hating him or anything but the guy is immortal. If you inflict damage while being anywhere near him you might have your life sucked out of you. He is also immensely strong by himself.Mascot Cobra  He just looks cool thats all and i always like bad boys with girls behind their motives. His hearing is also very useful providing August and Freed with much needed info to diverge their plans and create their Runes. He can also help locate the enemies preventing the team from wasting their time and magic looking for them while helping Midnight reflect back attacks. His poison can also prove useful to the outcome and he can cover an entire area in it without affecting his own team thanks to Wendys healing magic. of course the team would still be fine without Erik fighting he is a mascot after allLast line of defense Franmath  When most of the team has fallen taking down most of the enemies its time for Franmath to come in. Using his Absorption he can suck in his own team and the enemys souls giving him a massive boost in power and magic variety. He can also absorb the enemys magic rendering them powerless. From then on its similar to having the original team fight against an injured almost defeated enemy force.This is a very nice idea i think you should do this every week. It helps exert our creativity and intellect quite a bit.,fairytail,cy7qc65,2,t5_2s9z2

I would think he killed her in order to return the key back to Layla so that Layla could open the eclipse gate for him.

Nothing to do with the fact that it was pretty much establish they would never see each other again.Im sorry but that moment lost all its impact no matter what you or anybody says. It wasnt the fact she lost a contract or key it was the fact that she lost a friend. Thats why she hesitated as much as she did when she broke it thats why she cried and grieved as much as she. gtShe cant summon her againWell now she potentially can all she has to do is find her keygtin that moment Lucy never thought she would see Aquarius againDo you honestly hear what youre saying? Let me explaingtLucy broke keygtLucy is sad because she destoryed her contractgtLucy is sad because she cant see Aquarius ever againgtOne year later Lucy can potentially see Aquarius again because Celestial Deus Ex Machina That moment was so impactful because Lucy and everyone else thought she would never see Aquarius. Let me repeat at the time SHE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE AQUARIUS AGAIN. Now that she has the potential that emotional scene is less impactful than it used to be.Again youve yet to explain where it was ever eluded to Lucy being able to see Aquarius before these chapters. Yes it is an asspull. God FT has been so stuffed with so many asspulls the fans are legitimately believing that clear asspulls arent. The reason and time that she came back is an asspull sorry to burst your bubble. So when you BREAK IT ALL DOWN. Aquarius coming back the way she did at the time she did giving the reason she did meanwhile destroying character development its a pretty shitty chapter other than the completely random exposition given.

Perhaps he was able to kill dragons because he has no problem taking a life while Natsu despite all his bravado is really more about helping people find redemption. Even Gageel it is pointed out could easily have killed Levi when he nailed her to that tree. His guild master had no issues destroying fairytail utterly. But he let them all live.

The world may never know but think of it this way.  Laxus allegedly coulda one shot Ajeel August states that its a pain to lose a comrade after he blocks the lightning strike Ajeel was overpowering Erza with ease it took a direct shot from jupiter cannon to take him down and if he hadnt inhaled all those particles he could probably go toe to toe with Zeref.  Not saying he woulda won but he could probably have done some damage.  Now that being said FDK Natsu  Zeref gt Laxus gt Ajeel gt Erza gt Natsu.  ,fairytail,czstzjf,2,t5_2s9z2

They were just so calm and chill and I loved the gags in between and the character interactions. Honestly I wanted the reunion arc to go on for a good  chapters because of its lighthearted tone.That being said I still believe the best of Fairytail has been Tartarus. It was all just set up so perfectly we even had a lighthearted arc to set up for it. Every time I look back at a scene in the Mangaanime im like damn this is epic. The tension was real the feels were real and it genuinely felt like a struggle. Thats what I want Alveraz to be but it just isnt delivering tbh. Even the scenes with Acno and Zeref that had me flying from my seat in Tartarus are kind of underwhelming now..So basically I like a balance of the two tones but when it gets serious it should really get serious.

7013102,0,t3_4bpie8,Unpopular opinion...but kill off Jellal. Im sure Hiro couldve written around it but I just dont like the idea of keeping Jellal alive. It just brings so much bad emotions and memories for Erza. Sure he has changed all of that and he was controlled by a inner voice of Zeref but the bad shit he did still happened. Killing Simon making Erza suffer mentally for years using his friends as basically slaves for years... I take a realistic approach whether thats right or wrong when I think of Jellal. Some things in this world cant be forgiven. I like where the Jellal character is going now though... with the whole making a guild to repent his sins stuff its cool. Nothing bullshit. But theres a sense of realism that is so lost when Erza still loves him for some reason. Sure he gave her last name to her but like...you were kids. Get over it. He killed the man who loved you used your friend and destroyed you mentally for years. Wtf? I wouldve liked to see what Fairy Tail as an animemanga be like if he was dead. Take it with a grain of salt though. Also I love the things youd change fully agree with it.

7015058,0,t1_d1b4gb6,Uh well usually when I argue that Gildarts will return when Cana is in danger thats a euphemism for Gildarts will return when Cana actually gets to goddamn fight somebody. Canas been in dangerous situations true but the story has yet to put Cana in a straightforward versus battle. Thats when I expect Gildarts to return. The GildartsCana relationship is a subplot that needs to get resolved and Cana needs to have a real battle before Fairy Tail ends. Theres only one way to resolve the two and the story is on the verge of the perfect opportunity. I find it difficult to believe that Mashima would have Cana just wait at the guild hall if he didnt have something in store for her.   ,fairytail,d1bi6wf,1,t5_2s9z2

7215459,0,t3_4e944n,Thoughts on this chapter I was right!!! Neinhart materialises peoples past emotions and memories into their enemy... very cruel indeed! Omgosh the feels coming from Erza and Kaguras eyes TT Wow with a snap of his finger Neinhart blasted a hole through the ship! Oh its that annoying shrine maiden warrior that Erza fought Kaguras emotions are beautifully portrayed in the underwater scene through her expressions! Noooo Erza got cut by that witch TT Azuma makes appearance  Tree of Arc here it comes!! Erza against multiple enemies that is hardly fair!!! OH NO NO NO Kyoka the sadistic witch is back... OMGOSH UR IS BACK to fight Lyon and Gray... WTHECK Neinhart is way too strong! Gahhhhh all the villains are back... This is one heck of a fight Omgosh Hadez vs Laxus... YAS! The last quote is very beautiful and it perfectly sums up the change we want to see in Jellal Kagura and Erza.  What those who still live need more than anything... is not to dwell on the past... but to look ahead and strive towards the future! Jellal its time for you to let go of your past and start kindling your romance with Erza! As for you Kagura start being forgiving and accept that you have a future which YOU can DEFINE and not by your PAST! Let it go Let it go...Hyperventilating! This was an amaizng chapter and definitely worth the read. Neinhart is a very strong Spriggan and I guess we will have a few chapters of intense battles. Looking forward to all of them!!!,fairytail,d1ycb27,5,t5_2s9z2

Yeah its cliche to kill off the old guy but hes in relatively poor health and has gotten a number of situations that were theoretically supposed to kill him that hes survived. And its clear that death is the only way the position of guildmaster will permanently transfer to someone else. So let him get one last cast of Fairy Law against some big enemy then die from a heart attack caused by the strain. Youd simultaneously get a fulfillment of all earlier Makarov has heart problemsMakarov will sacrifice himself for the guild moments and get a strong justification for Makarov not using Fairy Law against later threats that youd really think would warrant at least attempting it. ,fairytail,d2ap9nv,2,t5_2s9z2

She sincerely tries to make herself pure again but she still struggles with it shows how she wasnt brainwashed she provides a sistermother like figure to Meredy. She sacrifices her time to save others then she doesnt want to burden her guild mates and so she leaves silently realizing that she could finally be free.She was a true villain unlike Jellal who even we couldnt forgive because she knew what she wad doing. Also the other characters you mentioned were all roped into a ship so people would be thinking that they got off easy I dont think so I simply love Ultear,fairytail,d2dd6tz,2,t5_2s9z2

7355639,0,t1_d2e16ki,Im not sure you understand what regression means. Just because characters exist who are stronger than her doesnt  mean she is somehow becoming less developed which is what regression would imply in this context. Also Im not quite sure how you can claim Mirajane is stronger than her when Erza has never lost a fight. Though your ignoring that she couldnt defeat Jellal in the tower of heaven arc and your also ignoring that while she may win most of her fights shes almost always exhausted to the point where she is unable to help Natsu in the big end fight. Look at Tower of Heaven GMG Tartarus. Im sure theres others but Im not gonna bother looking it up And just as you said she has developed she starts off as being very standoffish towards Natsu and the others she wont tell them about her past or ask them for help when shes in trouble. Obviously thats not how she is now and whether or not you like how her progression was handled its still progression. Edit For her character to technically regress shed have to go back to being a cold and distant character. ,fairytail,d2eaavg,1,t5_2s9z2

7447715,0,t3_4hajhk,Ah you are doing something similar as to what I am I see! I pretty glad that you are. As of yet there have been quite a bit more revelations than hints so it is easier to make more speculations and shitposts . than theories. I would recommend focusing on a specific topic before moving on to the grand scheme since your ideas can flow better that way.Anyway here are some things on an idea that may help you in theorizing about the final plot point of Fairy TailBasis and Origins of Magic  . Many characters throughout the series perceive magic to come from a certain emotion. Natsus magic generally comes from anger. Lucy derives that magics true nature is from love. Hades believes the source is darkness while Mavis believes it comes from light. I think Makarov states it best though when he talks to Hades about it Magic is alive! Its role changes with the times. It grows along with us. Even though this statement does clear up a lot about what is magic there is still room for a lot of ideas here!  . So the drive for Fairy Tail guild is a simple but possibly unreachable goal. Do fairies have tails do they even exist? I think I may have some clues as to why this is a tough mystery to solve. Fairies may be in some way shape or form be related to the origins of magic. Now you may be thinking Wait wouldnt that be Ankhseram since he is the assumed pinnacle of the FT universe? Well the thing about that is Ankhseram may control basic aspects of the realm but I dont necessarily think Ankhseram instigates all change. Maybe fairies somehow founded magic. In European folklore fairies are described as supernatural beings exceptionally skilled in the art of magic. They are sometimes even described to be driving certain forces of world. I think the reason why the origin of magic may be such a unimaginable concept is because people in the FT world have never had any interaction with fairies. Basically two of the biggest enigmas in the series are heavily linked.Well those are my two cents. Hope this helps! D,fairytail,d2orars,2,t5_2s9z2

This is an extreme example but if I were writing an essay on cheese then without any context switched to the way a fan works it would be stupid. Saying something is wellwritten means it is written in a way that lacks flaws that would otherwise create inconsistencies or bring the writer out of the story. Look up what makes a well written story than look up why HxH is considered to be very wellwritten. You will find similarities between the two sources.

The next chapter leaves me to believe that August will withhold his attack for a period of time perhaps  days? in exchange for food as hes probably not in any hurry to be the one to do it let the underlings handle his light work. This would give time to hash out the ErzaEileen connection maybe somebody mentions Erzas name in passing Id guess Mira and Eileen reacts? and she will stop August from destroying her guild.

7633018,0,t1_d39ou9c,Zero is a spin off. Do you not consider that canon? Is it not canon? You also dont fall that fast. Bluenote wouldve seen him coming everyone wouldve seen it. He is not there as hes bringing his hand forward when all of a sudden he is there in between Cana and Bluenote before anybody even realized it.    Also theyre canon so I dont see the problem with accepting them as feats. Gildarts is fast. Its clear that is Mashimas intention with everything weve seen. He sure as hell aint slow. And if you havent been able to tell some of the more powerful people are pretty fast themselves. Acnologia is utterly ridiculous.m Jellal Laxus Adult Cheliam Dragon Force Natsu Mirasupposedly as well as others. I guess if they cant touch you it doesnt really matter. But being able to run under intense gravity definitely gives him the leg power capable of rocketing pretty fast. ,fairytail,d39tzf6,0,t5_2s9z2
7633651,0,t3_4jqasw,gtWhos your best girlguy?Asuna... though more in the first half of season one than afterwards.gtFavorite Episode?I really enjoyed the Kirito and Asuna romance episodes and was disappointed when they ended so suddently.gtOpinions on the Story?Its... ok. Interesting enough to keep me well interested but nothing I would praise. SAO  except maybe Mothers Rosario now that was awesome.agtWould you watch a second season read light more light novelsmanga ext.?Saw the nd season tried starting the th LN but lost interest quickly so Ill probably just wait for a season . Ive heard good things about the following arc but Im not planning on hyping myself up for it either.gtOverall thoughts? Score? Recommendation?Its a solid series. Doesnt deserve huge amounts of hype but doesnt deserve hatred either. Its good enough to be enjoyable and thats what counts for me. I gave the first season a  and second a  if only because of that last arc and wouldnt really recommend it to anyone unless theyd only recently gotten into anime.gtSAO is often considered one of the most over rated series of all time but personally I enjoy that its cliche and had a fun time back when I watched it. What are your opinions on what the anime community has to say about the show?I dont agree with the side that thinks its amazing nor do I agree with the side that thinks its trash. Id just say that its ok.gtPeople often reason that each of SAOs arcs could probably stand as a series in their own regard but dont work as well when seen as arcs. Do you prefer the world hopping or would it be better than more details are put into each world and only move on once everything is finished?That depends on the arc. Id love it if the first arc was its own series and had time to expand upon everything but no thanks to the second arc. As for SAO  I wouldnt like to see GGO as its own series at all would kinda enjoy Excalibur as long as they explored other areas and would have mixed feelings about Mothers Rosario since I thought it was a perfect length.agtSAO tends to step back from using excessive amounts of fanservice but a majority of its cast is still female. Do you think that this strategy does as well of a job to appealing to the young teenage audience as fanservice or would it do better to use fanservice to their advantage.Too many of these stuckinagameworld anime have fanservice so I thought this was actually a relief. Adding in fanservice would sorta suck imo.,fairytail,d39wkhx,1,t5_2s9z2

However like i said unless they somehow give him something better than Fairy Heart negotiations and all that time bought might only help Cana free Mavis at best a good thing to have. But without knowing the extent of her power  i wont assess how useful that would be. The logic in Mests actions have come from seeing the failure in negotiating and waiting for stronger enemies to change. Then  your negotiating team is Lucy who wouldntn be of much use unless she she summons the spirit king or is adept at TnJ Natsu wanna start a fight Dragneel and your enemy who has made it clear that she isnt in it to help you she said so herself.  Thats a bad team readers perspective  goggles off .Brandish going in with no plan is not taking him seriously. She was going to wing it and bank on her relationship with August  which as far as we know was she knew him from a young age no real mention of how mutual their feelings were and thats a horrible plan no better than catching him off guard with a giant blade to the gut.  If Brandish had a real plan of action Id be pissed at Mest but its not stupid to distrust your enemies and make a decision that could give you the upper hand in the war and August is a threat unless hes dead everyone had basically stated that when mentioning him. ,fairytail,d3y4w91,1,t5_2s9z2

I wonder if Neinhart has an upper limit to how strong his ability can be because it doesnt seem to be his magic power because otherwise this seems like an infinite power combo to me only limited by Mests or Mashimas imagination. The last time an imaginationbased magic was used Ark of Embodiment I was a tad disappointed by Rustyroses level of creativity.

8668833,0,t3_4yo49d,Im definitely with you on this. My favorite bond is between Lucy and Aquarius since they go way back and she meant a lot to Lucy growing up she was her only fiend. I also liked that we got to see that Aquarius cares about her too even though she calls her annoying most of the time. I also like her bond with Loke. I kinda shipped them for a short time but I still love how she managed to save him so thats why I think he truly cares about her which you dont always clearly see through his insisted flirting that he does with practically everything. Like you I think Scorpio is an interesting spirit. He seems pretty strong but usually leaves pretty fast for one reason or another. So we dont see much of him.,fairytail,d6p835b,5,t5_2s9z2

9071756,0,t3_54iuui,Ooooooo sweet thanks a ton for the early chapter uyonkouproductions. The torture scene was a little silly but I suppose Dimaria was planning on going a lot further than that things wouldve gotten weird real fast. Very proud of Lucy for her brave response to Dimaria gouging her eyes out yet again showing her amazing growth as a character.And ENDs finally awoken I suppose. Pretty impressive that he can move through time and destroy Dimarias chronos form like that. Im a little disappointed that we didnt see that fight but I suppose it wasnt completely necessary. Lucy seemed to react to Natsu being END but Ill need clarification from the official translations for that.I have to say that it feels a little rushed that weve gotten to END and END vs. Gray so soon but its still pretty exciting. I dont really care too much about the physical part of the battle but the emotional part should be really really interesting. Its going to be difficult for Gray considering Natsus one of his closest friends and Im looking forward to seeing how he deals with this tricky situation. When Natsu regains his sanity hell probably feel bad for how he fought one of his closest friends so we should see some nice angst there. Lucy and Juvia will probably interrupt the fight at some point since they should have the most influence on both Natsu and Gray respectively. Great moment for all you NaLu and Gruvia shippers out there.Crack seems like a cool name though I have no idea what it could mean.

Its highly likely that the Historias arent as restricted when he isnt summoning  Spriggan level people the same time one of them being a pretty strong one in the first place with God Serena. Hades may have been way closer to full power because all of the others were decently weak or not Spriggan level. Bradman and Wahl started really kicking ass after God Serena got taken out so they may have gotten a boost in power. Or its cuz Neinhart got a power up. Idk.

9543236,0,t1_d9pegu8,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,fairytail,d9pegvp,26,t5_2s9z2

Jacob would pummel Marde Geer into the ground especially seeing as he dont have breast. The only way Marde Geer would stand a chance against Jacob is with a huge dose and I mean Huge dose of PIS or CIS. Otherwise Marde Geer gets stomped. Also Jacob transport actually took away  Guilds membersBrandishMarin while Marde Geer spell did nothing. So no way in the hell can you say they have the same amount a feat power. Mori Memento deserves no credit because it didnt accomplish what is was said to do. Jacob power actually did what it was suppose to do though.Ajeel body is made of sand meaning Marde Geer thorns are useless against him. Also considering he easily dried up Erza swords one doesnt have to be human to be turned to dust. Add in the fact he can mode his sand into monsters Marde stands little to no chance against Azir. None of his attacks would even faze Azir. Once again without a huge dose of PIS and CIS Marde Geer stands zero chance against Azir. What evidence do you have that Ice lock wont work on Marde Geer because he is a demon? Mavis is an immortal infinite amount of magic and Ice lock still worked perfectly fine on her. Also Silver is vastly superior to Gray when it comes to Devil slayer magic. Silver was able to freeze Atlas flame essence and the entire Sun village. Gray has no feats to compare. Not to mention Silver one shotted Natsu and Marde Geer drastically struggled against him. On what basis do you have that Marde Geer would stand a chance against Silver? Silver lost to Gray because he wasnt serious about defeating Gray because he wanted to test Gray out. Unless you are trying to say Pre Time skip GraygtgtgtPre Time skip Natsu. The only way Marde Geer would even have any shot of defeating the Spriggan  is with a huge dose of PIS or CIS.P.S CSK wasnt almost overwhelmed by the thorns clearly as the panel I showed clearly showed that. Also the Anime added things that arent in the Manga and shouldnt be taken as canon. In the anime Laxus fights Tempesta a second time but in the Manga it is Gray is comes in and defeats Tempesta. The Manga is directly written by Hiro Mashima while the anime is only partially supervised by him. ,fairytail,dajhprl,1,t5_2s9z2

Following that Kuzan froze both Tsunamis almost instantly. Meanwhile while Mihawk was testing Luffy he cut one of the tsunamis in half with the air from his slash.

Happy didnt reply and continue to hug Natsus face so cute with tears. Lucy ask again as she gets more panic and her tone becomes more loud and demanding. Gray then talks about Natsus identity making everyone shocked while Happy cries even more. Back to Erza Wendy and Eileen. Their fights shows no progress as both sides are strong but Eileen manage to leave damage to Erza and Wendy while she suffers only little. Erza keep asking Eileen what she meant by her previous words that they are as one. Eileen keep her smirking on her face and didnt reply. Then well go back to where Natsu is with no one touring him around. He gets more confused by the situation around him as they begun to become black. What now? He ask sweating drop. Your answer lies further ahead. Zeref talks behind Natsu making him approach Zeref. I had enough on your stories! Tell me whats going on! Natsu shouts in front of him. It is up to you to believe everything or not. But make no mistakes these are all your missing memories in the past. And Ive done my job to fill it in your head. Zeref smiles. I never wanted this to happen but its already too late.Natsus expression becomes angry and shout at Zeref. I never ask to be revived! Id rather die than to hurt the ones that I love! Natsu thinks of Happy Lucy and the others. That is why I said earlier you will die. With Zerefs words everything becomes black and Zeref disappear. Back to Lucy and the others who were still shocked Natsus body begun to release more steam thats beyond hot and everyone distance themselves. Lucy begun to cry Natsu....! Please wake up with the Natsu that I know..! The Natsu that I love...! End statement With Natsus condition getting worser every moment is it already too late for Lucys feelings?!

In the original timeline Lucy was not in the palace. And its not resolved. Its a halfassed way to brush over it and pretend it doesnt really exist but its not resolved. Resolution means that it is shown that there is no paradox. Paradox. Oh magic. All good now. Nope doesnt work. Even magic no matter what world youre talking about cant make something both true and not true at the same time.What youre trying to say is that the paradox is irrelevant because its Mashimas world and we should all join the hordes of mindless zombies who believe he shits unicorns and rainbows.What Im trying to say is that Mashima created a world with unresolvable paradoxes.

Though I think he didnt intend for it to sound like Minerva and Kagura are equal to Erza he probably worded it poorly.Also about what you saidKaguram Sting is not stronger than Larcade hes a complete counter to Larcades abilities and powers himself up everytime Larcade attacks. Theres also the powerup from Rogue which not only doubled Stings overall power but also added an offensive counter to Larcade. Rogues magic was able to inflict extra damage to Larcade while Stings magic countered Larcades attacks. And in the end it still took additional help from Rogue and Kagura for Sting to win.Minervam We do not know for certain that Minerva and the others fought Bradman alone. For all we know Irene couldve been involved in the battle as well we have no way of knowing.,fairytail,dbdz5z3,1,t5_2s9z2

Its not anything too great but it got me liking the Twin Dragons Minerva and Yukino even more than before.The laxus one just plain sucks Its laxsus in Blue Pegasus and its as good as it sounds.

Doriate had an interesting power although I cant say I was impressed with anything else he brought to the table. Also great introduction to the concept of END!Tartaros arc was very memorable for me since it was the first arc I read weekly well the nd half at least. I liked the change of tone with a darker feel than usual. The magic council all being killed by Jackal Erza and the Strauss siblings being captured and Tartaros trying to activate FACE was really cool setup and one of my favourite prologues to an arc in the series. Natsu being essentially oneshotted when he tried to infiltrate and being captured was a refreshing change to the formula. Erzas torture was done well as it did more than give us superficial fanservice  it gave her some inner conflict as we saw in the epilogue of the arc. The battles were pretty good my favourite being Jellal vs. Oracion Seis was amazing seeing the coolest spells in the series being thrown left and right. Lucy defending FT and summoning the CSK was by far her best moment in the series and I was so happy to see her growth there. I thought the nd half was a little rushed but it was still enjoyable and I loved things like Silver and Grays confrontation Mard Geers etherious form and the dragons popping out of nowhere and dominating the battlefield. Acnologia vs. Igneel was something else.The conclusion to the arc was fantastic and it was bittersweet seeing Makarov disband the guild. The Mest reveal was a nice surprise certainly didnt expect that. And then by far my favourite part of the arc END was revealed to be Etherious Natsu Dragneel and my favourite fan theory came true.,fairytail,dckxdjf,3,t5_2s9z2

10519848,0,t1_dd0h0n0,Yes she is however many people fail to notice how short of time Wendy has truly lived in the Fairy Tail universe which is what makes her arguably the strongest character in Fairy Tail completelyand is the reason I made a theory on her. She was raised by Grandeeney and taught Sky DS Magic it should be noted that Grandeeney did not fully teach Wendy which was why the spells had to be somehow passed down topic for another time unlike the other four and we have yet to know why. Soon after she was jumped  years into the future. She loses Grandeeney and meets Mystogan. About a couple weeks laternot sure of the actual time Mystogan leaves Wendy to Cait Shelter. Several years go by before meeting with Fairy Tail and the Nirvana Incident occurs and she loses Cait Shelter. She then joins Fairy Tail. One Month later Edolas happens and she loses Mystogan. Between one to two months after that Tenrou happens and she is comatosed for seven years. She wakes up and the GMG happens three months later after being jumped again for being in the celestial world so far she has only been with Fairy Tail for  months from her perspective. GMG ends and another month goes by before Tartarus. After Tartarus Fairy Tail was disbanded meaning Wendy from her perspective has only been a Fairy Tail mage for  months! She went from a shy healer to an independent badass in three to four MONTHS! Keep in mind everyone else had to train for years to get to this point! Moving on the one year time skip happens and here we are today. Yes she has been in Lamia Scale longer than Fairy TailAs for Wendy enchanting the sword Wendy has never enchanted an object before until now. Wendys past enchantments only affected people Speed Durability Power and Recovery. This is because she branched her enchantments off of Sky DS Magic which only applies to people. Irenes Sage DS Magic focuses on pure enchanting and empowering enchantments on anything. By stealing  and creating a SageSky Dual Dragon Slaying Magic like weve seen before with the other Dragon Slayers she can easily apply her enchantments onto anything now with no limits and because Irene has demonstrated a glimpse at the potential of both Wendys Magic during the body swap and Sage Magic Universe one Master Enchantments Body Magic and now seeing Wendy use both of these DS Magics to apply a copy of her DS Magic to Erzas weapon FUCKING TERRIFIES ME! Because by all rights given this evidence Wendy is the one who is the true victor this fight even while incapacitated using Erza as her weapon against Irene and because the weapon was still enchanted while in Irenes hand is what allowed Irene to kill herself so the damage once again belongs to Wendy! Im sorry if this got very long and complicated in fact this topic could continue as its own post that Im thinking about making. but I hope you see where I am going with this and how she was able to suddenly accomplish this feat!,fairytail,dd0je9f,4,t5_2s9z2

10543434,0,t3_5qnnim,Lol as much as I love Wendy some of your arguements is just baseless no matter how I want to believe it. Trust me youre not the only one who would love to see Wendy get even stronger. I also have a headcanon that Wendy would acquire Sage DS after their fight.But I cant also deny that the execution of her feat this chapter was asspull. And I dont like how Hiro is turning Wendy into a deus ex machina. Until before this fight all other fights of Wendy has been logical.He cant fight a Tartarus demon in base which should be the case in fhe first place. So she was given DF. And the way she acquired it was no asspull.Then we have her against Bluenote. As fodder as he became this is still the man who was once able to fight head on w Gildarts. So obviously Wendy in base should be no match as well even after a  yr timeskip.Then came Dimaria. A character who was supposed to be on the same level of the man who stomped the GOI. No one is gonna believe that Wendy will stand a chance. And just as expected she was stompped even in DF.Now came with Irene. Queen of Dragons with  yrs of knowledge and exp didnt get one shotted by Acnologis. And all of a sudden Wendy and Erza can keep with her in enchantment battle. Then she just keeps on pulling feats without prior foreshadowing. Thats where the issue comes in. Thats why people are starting to call her deus ex machina. And I csn only blamem Hiro for this. Like seriously it only took one fight for Wendy with Erza to become this asspull character. Erzacis very contagious. Wendy is one the very few who had very great development but Hiro just went overboard with this fight.I just hope Wendy wont receive the same hate people are giving to Erza. And as Ive said I really do like to see Wendy to develop more to the op character that she is.,fairytail,dd37s60,1,t5_2s9z2

I would think that they were leeching off of eachother preventing Natsu using his full power and thats why he hasnt gone force as of yet.Based on how dragonification seems to work it seems the largermore developed the dragon seed the easier it is to enter force because you are closer to becoming a dragon. Id guess entering force would accelerate the growth. ,fairytail,ddhncit,1,t5_2s9z2

10805094,0,t3_5ujgmd,I love the concept of guild mark. It says something about the personality and identity of the character. Below is my top  guild mark locations for FT characters    ampnbsp. Kagura ???    I still wonder where Kaguras guildmark is. There is no visible mark when Dimaria stripped her on the battlefield. There is no guildmark at her back based on this official art as well     ampnbsp. Juvia Left Thigh    Juvias character design is superb and her costume Slit dress and leggings mixed well where her guild mark is.    ampnbsp. Ultear Back    I like Ultears new costume as Crime Sorciere member. It was made backless so there will some space for her guild mark. Having guild mark at the back doesnt mess up with females foreview as well.    ampnbsp. Natsu Right Shoulder    Shoulder is one of the most common selection especially in men to put tatoo. Having a guildmark in the shoulder as a front man of guild is epic. I like it when Natsu onepunch everyone showing his guildmark in the process.    ampnbsp. Brandish Right Thigh    With Brandish costume she can have many options to put her guild mark and easily flash it. With bikini there is no other sexier place to put it other than her legs. Brandish is like a standardbearer of Spriggan  because she always shows the guilds emblem during Alvarez arc.,fairytail,ddugwrf,9,t5_2s9z2

Because looking back there is foreshadowing to the direction Mashima decided to take August in it just didnt start until Larcade was formally introduced.

11546910,0,t1_dg3sb7w,Basically any main character is going to be incapable of dying in their series due to plot armour which doesnt apply in cases like this and those are some pretty big One Piece spoilers that you didnt tag.,fairytail,dg4uf38,2,t5_2s9z2
11570246,0,t1_dg6wfqa,Jokes aside for a moment this is why I thought it might possibly be Happy who triggered END and not Lucy like a lot of others were.You dont touch the exceeds. Aside from Future Rogue going evil when Frosch was killed Natsu stopped his rampage of Sabertooth because Minerva had Happy and Sting lost it when he thought Lector was dead putting a hole in Jiemma.,fairytail,dg7hrfb,4,t5_2s9z2
11571126,0,t3_64ybst,I been saying this but Zerefs plan sound like what happened at the end of Part  of Jojos bizarre adventure. If it does happens and Hiro is resetting series to improve it then I wont mind. I might actually like it since Hiro is actually showing balls and want to improve his series. But the only problem with this is.. Will people want to read a reboot FT series? Not saying people wont read it but it is a question that should be answer.,fairytail,dg7lcwz,1,t5_2s9z2

11793507,0,t3_689h33,I absolutely love the series but I wish they had expanded on the scope and lore of the universe some more. Give the universe and the lore as a whole some much needed expansion and explore what the world of Fairy Tail is like. For example Lost Magic explore why it became lost and how dangerous it really was or how the world was like when Zeref was still alive. I wish the series stopped with the fakeout deaths Im tired of seeing them now if dont have the balls to kill a character then dont make us think theyre going to die. Regarding GMG I kinda wish Fairy Tail had to struggle a hell of a lot more to win or actually lost. That way it would show them the world moved on and grew without them and they are going to have to really work to improve if they wish to keep up and regain a foothold. They could have lost but still earned enough admiration or enough respect to let them rebound and start to recover.The Dragon Attack would also greatly boost their popularity since they were the ones who destroyed the gate and contributed the most to the fighting. I wish Minervas redemption never happened she shouldve just died or there shouldve been more of her working to redeem herself. She did a lot of horrible shit even if it was against Fairy Tail at the end of the day she still ran off and joined a Dark Guild. Then became the pet bitch of Tartaros not exactly someone you should just welcome back with open arms no questions asked.I think Sabertooth and some of the other mages of other guilds shouldve gotten some more screentime. I know the series is focused around Fairy Tail but I wouldve loved to of seen some filler episodes or something that focused on the background characters for a change. The people of other guilds so we can see more of them and see what a day in their lives is like. That said I would absolutely love to see some of the spinoffs animated especially the Twin Dragon Slayer one. Itd give those characters some much needed limelight and I found them to be enjoyable. Lisanna should have stayed dead. She contributed NOTHING  to the series since returning. If she actually did something thatd be great that reunion scene was one of the best in Fairy Tail but she contributes nothing afterward. Plus she spawned that Lucy gets kicked out of Fairy Tail bullshit in Fanfiction so lets add that to reasons for her to stay dead. No more of that Because shes Erza bullshit and no Juvia none.First series all the way colorful bright cheerful it was so much better than the dull washed out second series. Tartaros was solid I thought even though Ryo raised a lot of very good points in his rants but the series shined the best in the first series. Favorite moments included the Twin Dragon Slayer fight NOT THE ENDING! that fight was one of my favorites and the schaudenfruede I got from it was immense. The reunion scene with Natsu and Lisanna was amazing I thought. Gajeels reaction to seeing Lily in his small form was just priceless that is a real bright spot in an otherwise dull arc. There was something about Makarov offering Gajeel a place in Fairy Tail I just adored. Despite everything Makarov still offers to help Gajeel back on the right path but makes it clear hell never be forgiven for what he did I just really like that. Natsu kneeling before Gildarts was incredible too bad Mashima pissed it all away a few chapters later with Zancrow. Thats one thing Id change Id keep that part in where Natsu learns sometimes he has to know when to back down and remembers that life lesson.Least favorite Minervas redemption the ending of the Twin Dragon Slayer Fight made worse by that stupid speech that awful bitch Mavis gave. Jiemma showing up out of nowhere in Tartaros and getting splatted by Rogue and Sting anything with Lector in it and Natsu eating the God Slayer Flames undoing the character development he got just a few episodes before.So what am I looking forward to in series ? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I think the series should have ended after Tartaros none of that  Faces bullshit all the dragons come out they kill Acnologia hes dead Zerefs dealt with somehow and the dragons say their farewells Natsu is crushed by Igneels death but happy that he got to see his father one last time and got to say goodbye. Fairy Tail is rebuilt and they continue living their lives. Oh and Juvia dies so does Carla and everyone celebrates Gray finds someone else who doesnt suck and they all live happily ever after. The end. Id love to see a Lamia Scale spinoff and something for Alzack Bisca amp Asuka. I think both could give some good material even if it is just for a short series. Tenrou had a great deal of hype and for the most part lived up to it pretty well. Underwhelming development? Thats easy! Mangam Irene. The stupid bitch just out of nowhere kills herself and Erza goes meh she came out of nowhere and amounted to nothing series wouldve been better off without her.Im still interested in the series mostly because of the Fanfiction at this rate. I still love the series I love the cast but I give up on the manga for good this time. I still readwatch it because I still genuinely love the series its just Alvarez I think is the worst fucking thing ever printed or created. If there were a solitary argument for why Anime is truly a mistake Alvarez is a convincing one. I refuse to acknowledge it as canon. TLDR First series all the way I wish sidecharacters got more  screentime Fairy Tail lost GMG or fought a hell of a lot harder to win with actual genuine losses rather than cheap tricks or asinine reasons for losing. Shouldve ended on Tartaros Alvarez sucks.,fairytail,dgwu10m,5,t5_2s9z2
