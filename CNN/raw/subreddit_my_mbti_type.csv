2407987,0,t1_cm9bxj2,Ah ok. One point irritiates me I thought the J stands for order work before play and decision making. But you analysed me so good so maybe the whole picture as an INFJ is more important than the single letter.Thank you Bela Ramses and Mouon. I just need an explanation to understand things. Im the type who question things and facts ,my_mbti_type,cm9c3zf,1,t5_2yn7i

5402292,0,t1_cw1xqxa,Okay after reading your post I am pretty pretty sure that you are a Ti Dom or Ti Aux user. You definitely use Ti. And for clarification You cant use Ti and Te but you can still use Te behaviour and its absolutely logical that you adapted yourself to the working enviromnent and even earlier in school because Te Behaviour is needed in that concept I mean sure we need to make logical reasonable decisions that are objectively to understand.And what you described as your Fi is from my point of view rather another part of your Ti. You try to make sense of the world around you in an subjective way. And especially if you are a Ti DomAux that means that your Fe is weaker in comparison. Having Fe does not mean that you cant have your own set of morals. It rather means that it is orientedbiased through the outer world. My guess would really be INTP. I found that blog that I listed earlier quite useful for myself maybe itll help out more. If you are an INTP that would mean that you have inferior FeThose are very subjective descriptions of inferior fe but maybe you can identify with it? If not just say so then Ill continue guessing around what might fit andor search for other sources as well as only using one blog can be biased haha ,my_mbti_type,cw27ayw,1,t5_2yn7i
