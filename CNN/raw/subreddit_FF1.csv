It is a isolated incident but its always best to wait at least a day before changing your engine as when I run the race the server goes under immense load while calculating results as such when it has to serve pages it goes a bit screwy thats why from now on the site will go down while running the race calcs.,FF1,d34l1k8,2,t5_3cqgg
