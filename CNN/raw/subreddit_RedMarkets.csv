Theres no rule saying you have to hold a microscope to the exploitation of people in capitalism or shove images of such into your players faces if you really dont want to. If everyone just wants to play a Boom game where you kill zombies for money and stick it to the Man then you should run that game.I mean all that other stuff is still THERE but youre absolutely free to ignore it in favor of less depressing elementskind of like how people do in real life.

9389212,0,t3_54fvuc,Yep. Realworld troubles. Weve definitely got more bubbles ready to pop and demographic fundamentals underlying everything like wet sand. My wife and I both work in higher education and weve both got student loans were grinding off. A real highered bubble pop could put us both out of work.,RedMarkets,d965daf,1,t5_3d296
