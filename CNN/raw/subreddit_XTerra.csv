I went through x parts since they have one here in Houston. The kit was about  the alignment was another . I think you could get out the door with labor for probably sub ish.I went with a R.

6400108,0,t3_436ns6,I second the advice not to rule out an S model. The Prox model is nice for sure but the electronic locking rear diff can be a bit of a problem spot. Theres nothing the Prox adds that cant be added aftermarket. Bilsteins skid plates locker light bar all common aftermarket mods. I wanted a Prox myself when I was in the market for my own but after talking extensively to the techs I worked with I decided any  or later x was good enough and Im glad I didnt go with the PX upgrade. Of the ones I saw come into the shop they had more issues that the other trim levels. Source I own a  S x and used to be a service advisor at a Nissan dealership. EDIT I should say theres nothing the Prox adds EXCEPT THE BADGING that cant be added aftermarket. Though if you wanted to badly enough you could duplicate the exterior badging. ,XTerra,czh4kud,2,t5_2szy7

While Id say mine is holding up really fucking well for it having k miles it doesnt mean I havent had a lot of work on it repairing and replacing parts.  A few of the problems Ive had were because I used to off road with it frequently and a little hard.I dont know which ones Ive replaced and how many but thisll just be a general idea of what Ive done  because idc to go through my paperwork lolAll  shocks replacedTie rods replacedujoints replacedball bearings replacedBrand new transmission put in right when I got it at k milesWater pump replacedFan replacedTiming belt replacedPlenty of hoses replacedBrakes replacedCracked exhaust manifold replacedHaving to spend  on a new windshield now because it crackedIm sure a few other things have been replaced and Im sure theres things I need to do it to because it hasnt been done in a while but I dont plan on spending a LOT more money on it which will be a shame because of all the shit I have on my Xterra.  For all youve done in a matter of k miles that seems to be A LOT.  It does make me sad to hear that youre having a lot of troubles with your X and maybe thisll be a turnoff for you but its understandable.  Im not a mechanic and I know this isnt something youd probably want to hear but if it was me Id probably get rid of it.  Thats a lot of shit that you needed to replace and if youre saying its riding hard idk.  Whatever they did to it really fucked it up.
