624520,0,t3_218s3t,If you are a beginner it probably isnt a great idea to buy expensive climbing shoes. You will destroy them before you have a chance to reap the full benefit. Get a cheap pair possibly used and thrash around in them until your technique improves. THEN buy expensive shoes when you have the footwork to back it up. If you are really set on buying nice climbing shoes you can go that route and just resole every now and then. However you probably wont know what shoe you like because the footwork is not there yet to make an informed decision.,climbergirls,cgb9bro,2,t5_2wrvu
2981571,0,t1_cnyjf5j,I should say my opinion. I have Evolvs. First problem is that they stink. I know most climbing shoes do but trust me for a person who doesnt sweat often and never had problems with stinky feet they are worse than my boyfriends year old shoes. Second problem is theyre really tough and they havent softened at all over time. They barely soften even after a  hour climb.They were my first climbing shoes Ive had them for about  months now but never again.Note other types of evolvs may be better than the pair I have and I realize that but all in all I havent heard the best about that band.,climbergirls,co70qk5,2,t5_2wrvu
4026502,0,t1_crf8l8e,Yeah I think Im much the same. Ive only managed to stick to training schedules a few times in the past without getting injured. It needs to be a regular thing to see real improvement. Programs have a structure and you should know what exercises you should be doing after warming up. Its not as fun as just going and climbing but you definitely improve!,climbergirls,crf91no,1,t5_2wrvu

8130753,0,t1_d4tx4wk,Congrats on the success! Thats great. Im sure youll get more. Just remember doing that first one because you did one so now you cant say you cant do one. It will remind you its possible. I think after getting a couple your confidence will go way up and it will get a lot easier. They will always get more challenging as climbs get more challenging but youll get better too. ,climbergirls,d4tyx4t,2,t5_2wrvu

11370691,0,t3_627o4o,I feel that way so often! Like if I complete a route it must be soft. It helps when I have another friend try it and tell me what they felt it was like. A simple yeah that part was tricky! Or something like that makes me feel a bit more validated. I wish I had the confidence in my climbing to just go yeah and Im a badass,climbergirls,dfkuhbb,3,t5_2wrvu
11692425,0,t1_dgjvtlj,You make a good point about the shoes. I think it also helps that the women here seem to know what theyre doing at least although its somewhat hard to tell with some of them since theyre climbing to pose for photos as opposed to climbing to well climb. The Americas Next Top Model shoot though... that ones just bad.,climbergirls,dglcrxj,1,t5_2wrvu
