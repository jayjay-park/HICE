3683981,0,t3_326lvf,I like different songs for different things. I tend to split my Halestorm into  different categories rockers and ballads.Dear Daughter is definitely the best ballad on this album but I also really like What sober couldnt stay.I cant decide on a favorite rocker yet but Im particularly drawn to I Like it Heavy but that could be because Ive been listening to the various singles for months.,Halestorm,cqc75ck,3,t5_2tg0b
