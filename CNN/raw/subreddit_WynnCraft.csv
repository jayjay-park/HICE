Although you can always do kill. Dont worry you arent going to lose items if you are at a good soulpoint amount above  as usquadpenguin stated. The best way to get out if you cant find an exit is doing kill.I didnt know about that in Maltic or at least I cant remember good to know tho imma check it later.,WynnCraft,d9a63qo,2,t5_2wcp4
