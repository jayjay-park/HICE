11417954,0,t1_dfq0dk4,The Saturday charity post! Do you need a link? It said something about making a nice comment and perhaps getting a wand made if you get chosen but I dont really care about getting a free wand that much I just think this is an awesome sub. ,Wandsmith,dfq7ov1,2,t5_3j2qu
11649538,0,t1_dgg1lcf,I have smaller hands and prefer thinner wands. I could maybe make it  instead of  and I wanted two woods because I like the look of layers of different colored woods and think itll make the wand look more unique. And for staining I wasnt sure I want the handle to be a lighter color and the rest to be a darker color because I like the contrast. Ill be home in about  minutes Ill send a picture of it. ,Wandsmith,dgghmdn,1,t5_3j2qu
