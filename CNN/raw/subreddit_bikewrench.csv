256375,0,t1_cf6vs66,You pretty just described our NoBS rim which we developed in part for the polo market. Fixcraft in particular has been ordering a bunch of h wheels in  amp  lately. Its a pretty solid rim.The thing about wheels its not as clear cut as more spokes  stronger wheel. More spokes also means more spoke holes in the rim therefore less material in the rim and a shorter distance between spoke holes so therefore less bracing. There are good arguments either way over the strength of high spoke count wheels. My unscientific instinct is that the wheel overall may be stronger but the rim itself is weaker. In high spoke count wheels especially smaller diameter ones Ive seen failures along the inner web which Ive not really seen on any other type of rim.

If not do you know about the chains before the one that just came off?Theres one thing you can do to see if you get any skipping. Find a big hill. Put the front shifter in the small ring. Then go up the hill in each individual rear gear. If the chain skips in any of them replace cassette. If you only have a mild hill do it in the middle ring up front.

699073,0,t3_225iiv,My first recommendation is to get some good measurements when you have the frame for the rear hub.  Distance between dropouts should be pretty close.    steerer on the fork looks threadless.  Brake mounts on chainstay is likely a cantilever mount. They are Ubrakes. BB looks to be installed.  Square taper... should just need crank arms.I envision a slightly flashier than this retro MTB gravel cruiser build.  Pick your wacky shaped bars source up an sp drivetrain depending on that hub size of course etc.  It would be awesome as a towniegravel shredder but as CJ mentioned earlier youd have a rough hah time on any technical trails.

961335,0,t3_253d0f,Personally Id wait and try to find one with tapered its what the frame is designed for. Sure you can an adapter headset and the bike will still be sweet but it will never be quite as stiff or as strong as it would be with the tapered fork. The front of the bike can also end up looking a bit weird running a straight steerer as the crown of the fork is usually a fair bit smaller than the frame so the head tube overlaps the fork.Can you order from eBay? I live in NZ was in the same situation and was about to order via eBay from the States or direct from TaiwanChina a lot of good deals but just as I was about to give up and do that the perfect fork appeared on the local auction site for a very good price.That said I recently bought a Giant MTB with OD which makes tapered forks look simple to get hold of for that I ended up getting a standard tapered fork which needs a top race adpater.,bikewrench,chdk9qp,1,t5_2sje0

1159677,0,t3_27ehut,Is the shifter releasing cable?  If so adjust the lower limit or cable tension.  If the indexing is working right on the other two rings Id try backing out the lower limit screw  turn at a time until you get a downshift.Are you clicking the shifter and not seeing any cable slack develop between the exposed cable runs?  Lubricate your cable and housings between the shifter and first run of exposed cable.  This means that the cable is jamming in the housing and not indexing.  Chances are if its a newer bike you are dealing with a limitcable tension issue since there has not been enough time to corrode the shifter housing and cable to the point that the front derailleur spring cannot overcome cable friction.  EDIT  I thought you meant the bike wasnt downshifting into the smallest chainring on a triple.  Going to leave the top response since its good to know if you have trouble shifting the front ever.  You probably need a little more cable tension.  Get the bike in a stand and slowly crank up the barrel adjuster tension until your upshifts slow down.  I like to run my cables as tight as I can before compromising upshift quality as this makes downshifts snappier and allows for a longer service interval.  Depending on how old the shifters are the ratchet mechanism could be gunked up or there could be a crack somewhere in the shifter allowing the ratchet to not hold position under a large amount of cable tension has the bike ever been droppedwrecked on that shifter?.  ,bikewrench,ci02y8y,1,t5_2sje0

1450504,0,t1_cixovss,Could you please explain how the hub cones and axle could possibly affect the trueness of the wheel? You are right in that old wheels should stay true if tension is correct. However a severely damaged rim will require uneven tension to make straight and will much easier come out of true. You can try to bend the rim back by loosening the corresponding spokes and bending it or replace the rim. Replacing rim is cheaper than buying new wheel if you do the labour yourself. ,bikewrench,ciy3h1n,1,t5_2sje0

2024529,0,t1_ckwmum3,Im afraid I somewhat agree with uandrewcook here.  Your analogy to a car having alternator problems doesnt really work.  You mentioned in your other post you had an old Schwinn Traveler.  How old?  Is there a lot of rust?  Was it ever sitting outside for a period of time?  Abandoned?  How did you come into it?  The car analogy would be more similar to me saying I just bought an old classic car the other day I know nothing about car mechanics or repair and my mechanic didnt fix every problem for a minimal price in two visits.  Whats his deal???  I sincerely doubt that if your mechanic completely overhauled your bike youd have so many recurring problems.  A tuneup is just that a tuneup.  Its not a complete overhaul and its very possible that there could be undiagnosed or unforeseen problems.  Personally for an older bike I always recommend changing the chain and freewheelcassette.  But that costs money and if you were trying to do this tuneup on the cheap or turned down optional preventative replacement parts then you cant be surprised that it DID turn out to be a problem later on.  There was actually a post in here recently where professionals had varying opinions about acceptable chaingear wear whats likely causing the skipping now.Now as several others have said here when he replaced the chain he SHOULD have changed or at least suggested changing the cassette freewheel.  Its just poor business to not mention something that will probably need to be changed at the same time.  As for the wheel not being on tight enough there are a lot of variables here.  When your bike was hanging was it hanging by the rear wheel?  Did the wheel bang into anything between the tuneup and you taking it out for a ride?  Its also possible that you have a whole host of other problems.  Your frame may be improperly spaced bent the skewer may not have been tight enough axle length could be wrong etc etc.  The rear brake being so loose it shifted with a touch doesnt mean much without more information either.  So to me no nothing here screams stay away.  He doesnt seem like the best communicator or teacher but if you dont want to pay the ridiculous amount at a professional cycle shop youre may not get the very best service.  To end with your analogy my backyard mechanic eyeballed a wheel alignment and my car STILL pulls to one side I dont want to pay the ridiculous labour rates at a garage but I want my  year old car to drive perfectly.  ,bikewrench,ckx5slz,2,t5_2sje0

3270879,0,t3_2xkp4v,I see a few potential issues nothing impossible but you should know what you might be up against.  Derailleur hanger  cant mount a derailleur without one. The image you posted shows no hanger mounting point. There are addon hangers out there and some lowend derailleurs come with hangers. You could also go with an internally geared hub which leads me to Rear dropout spacing  depending on your bike it may not be possible to fit a geared hub of any sort in the rear dropouts. Measure the distance between their internal faces. Cable routing  if you can put gears back there youll need a cable to operate them. Getting that from your bars to the rear end could take some creative housing work if there are no cable guideshousing stops. You can just run housing all the way but it adds friction and isnt ideal for indexed setups shifting where you have clicks. The workaround here would be to employ friction shifting no clicks you have to manually find the perfect amount of lever movement. Which then leads to Shifters  find ones that mount on your bar or stem depending on personal preferences and mechanical constraints. If you can use indexed shifting youll need shifters that match cable pull ratios. Not everything plays nicely here. Friction shifting again is a good workaround since its YOU doing the adjustments.So there are a bunch of potential issues. Obviously I cant tell you what to do without seeing your bike but in all honesty you could end up spending more money on adding gears than you would on a half decent used bike.,bikewrench,cp13uob,1,t5_2sje0

Generally Id say if you can build a bIke well from its boxedshipped state then you are of at least some value as a mechanic. Thats usually what it takes to get hired and then you can learn a LOT from there. Use youtube or the park site to learn things like adjusting derailleurs brakes and bearings hubheadsetbottom bracket. You should understand torque specs how to use them be able to confidently change flats do a simple dishtrue on wheels etc. Working on bikes is not difficult. The parts while they have many different standards and interfaces are not overly complicated. Even tearing apart suspension isnt too bad ifor  youre precise and patient. Being a good bike mechanic comes from your ability to carefully and correctly diagnose the problem while smiling and engaging with the customer. Sales is much the same as any retail position. If you can smile be personable and knowlearn the product youve got a shot. Just focus on whatever your local shop carries and read all about it.

3768894,0,t3_33i83q,gt The old one is about a links length longer than the new one from stretch.Thats a LOT of wear.  Heres what happens when a chain stretches...  When brand new each tooth on the cassette is being pulled by each link of the chain.  That means the force of you pedaling is spread out over the whole chain wrap worth of teeth.  As the chains rollers and pins wear the chains pitch effectively grows meaning they dont line up perfectly with each tooth anymore.  This means the chain now puts its force onto fewer teeth at a time since the stretched chain cant apply force past the first few teeth it contacts.  This causes increased wear of your cassette.  The increased gaps between teeth do sort of work with the worn chain for awhile because those worn open gaps help accomodate the stretched chain but then when you put on a new chain youre screwed.Proper replacement chain stretch limit is somewhere close to  and youve gone to .

3824193,0,t3_34639p,The pump gauge is really just reading the air pressure in the pump hose.  Often when you remove a pump hose from a valve the leaking sound is just air escaping from the pump hose not the tire.The tire valve only accepts air when the hose pressure is greater than that of the tire pressure.  The tire valve a springloaded valve that is also forced shut by the air pressure in the tire. Air only enters the tire when the pressure outside the valve e.g. in the pump hose is greater than the pressure inside the tire.  Thus if your tire is at  psi and your pump hose is only at  psi the tire valve is still shut and no air has entered or left the tire.  Only when the pump hose reaches above psi will air from the hose enter the tire. The pressure shown on your pump gauge is merely the highest effective pressure achieved in the pump hose while the tire valve was open. Try pumping your pump really slowly while attached to the valve to get a good measurement of the actual tire pressure.  When you pump quickly nonideal gas characteristics and air fluid viscosity end up distorting the gauge measurement.  Slow pumping gives a more accurate gauge measurement assuming the gauge is accurate for static pressures.,bikewrench,cqs6vi7,1,t5_2sje0

4767579,0,t1_ctvhgp0,If you just want to fix your and your own bikes then you are not really interested in becoming a bike mechanic. What I said is more pertinent you need to pick what battles you want to fight and fix on your own versus what to farm out. To have every tool needed to work on different bikes would be prohibitively expensive. It doesnt make sense to buy an expensive dishing tool to only dish one rim. It doesnt make financial sense to buy what you would need to bleed your hyrdaulic brakes if you have three different bikes that would need three different brake bleed tools. It doesnt make sense to stock every spare part you could need. If I am at a LBS and learn I need a new cable I am not gonna buy the cable a cable cutting tool and then go home and do it.

6333361,0,t3_42bzyg,Past C or C Ive found that the biggest problem with the drivetrain is the freehub pawls freezing up and it will refuse to engage at all. Im not sure what you mean by rigid to the point where it lags cycling backwards. If its stiff clean and lube the chain. The only issues Ive had is with the chain and rear derailleur icing over and getting stuck. Make sure that the rear deraileur pulleys are free of ice and snow and well lubricated. The stiff chain usually loosens up after a couple pedal strokes and I can ride like normal.As for suspension theres not a lot you can do there. Depending on the type of fork you have you may be able to put in a lighter weight oil but the low temps can also cause the seals to become stiff and potentially crack.

7049178,0,t1_d1fc00d,There are a lot of reasons why that isnt the crankset for you. Are you married to the Race Face brand? I ask because there are lots of good cranks out there for this application. You can use a mountain crankset but youll typically have a wider Q factor not necessarily a bad thing and often end up using some adapters to make it work with a mm bottom bracket shell which your bike presumably has.That said there are a lot of good bolt narrowwide chainrings and they are by far the cheapest on the market. So if you can find a  or  BCD crankset cheap and it will work with your bike without a ton of hassle then this isnt a bad way to go.Ill repeat my old advice which is find a decent used road crankset amp bottom bracket and the corresponding chainring.

Go through the whole chain with your fingers and bend the chain back and forth to make sure all links are loose.  Also look on the chain or find out the model number to make sure there is no direction issue.  Some newer chains have an inside and an outside.  They are not symmetrical.

It is normal that if you hold the wheel between your legs and yank hard the stem should move. That doesnt mean it will actually move while youre riding since theres normally very little resistance to rotating the fork in actual riding.Some folks do overtighten the stem but there are a couple of bad consequences to thisIf the bike falls over or crashes theres a greater chance of bending the handlebar or wrecking the brake lever if the stem is totally immoble.With a quill stem there is a risk of deforming the fork steerer causing it to bulge if you overtighten the stem. Sheldon Dont Get Carried Away BrownYoull have to pull the stem out to see if have a wedge or a cone. Google is your friend searching wedge vs. cone expander or head to the wiki page for stems where theres a comparison picture ,bikewrench,d3b4e12,2,t5_2sje0

7652447,0,t3_4k3nhe,For the most part with the  axle bolted in tight it should be pretty much straight and centered every time you clamp it down. I have a salsa Horsetheif with split pivot and have never had an issue. Maybe wiggle a flat head inbetween the pads to make sure the piston are pushed all the way out. Make sure you clean the flat head first to reduce the chance of oils getting on the pads.You can always also try loosening the brake bolts on the brake body mounts not the mounts to the frame squeeze the lever so it clamps and settles the brake body in place and tighten the bolts while squeezing the brake lever.

Before any new parts clean. Adjust your bars so the drops are comfy  usually aimed to the rear axle or so works  then set your hoods up so the main hand contact is on a flat plane.  Ride it before you add tape. Housing should only bend one way unless if cant be helped so trim a little bit from your seat stay top tube sectionand add maybe a quarter inch to the Rd loop.

7894218,0,t3_4nes6u,What Trek bike is it? ? ? got a photo? It makes some difference if its from  compared to if its from .But if it didnt come with suspension forks when it was new and is from the s unless its a bottom of the range model from the late s it wont be designed to take suspension forks . Its physically possible to fit short travel forks but they will raise up the front of the bike more than its designed  this causes two issues The handling and your riding position on the bike will change  the handling will be less responsive and the whole bike will be tilted backwards a bit It puts more stress on the welds that hold the front of the bike together this can lead to frame failureIn the s some people did put suspension forks on bikes not designed for them and they didnt always regret it but Id bet any of them that still own and ride those bikes today will have put the original rigid forks back on if they still have them.What are you thinking you will gain from putting suspension forks on it?Mountain bikes have changed a lot since your bike was new  mountain bikes from the early and mids are more like hybrid and touring bikes today and thats what they work well as  trying to turn them into something else like a modern mountain bike really just makes them worse bikes overall.Putting suspension forks on them doesnt give you an idea of what a riding a modern hardtail mountain bike is like and wont give you similar capabilities its more like putting a suspension fork on a hybrid bike.Bikes like the Trek  series are renowned as rugged touring bikes commuters and bikes that do well getting from A to B on any terrain and the simple lightweight accurately tracking rigid forks are a part of that. TLDR  I think this would make your bike worse and not achieve what you are hoping. You could get a second bike a hardtail MTB thats OK from around  or so for maybe  on Craigslist and it will have knobbly tires and be set up  for offroad riding  that would be my recommendation for what to do with your money if you want more capability for rugged offroad riding.,bikewrench,d43dtus,5,t5_2sje0

Thats a rare size and choices for new posts are very limited. You might be best off getting a shim so you can run a different sized post if you do change it. But the next size of post up is only .mm bigger its not impossible the bike has the wrong size post if you got it used.

8763505,0,t3_500f6m,If your wheel comes out of true due to an impact simply retruing it will always result in poor tension balance.  This is because truing the wheelBy turning spoke nipples is not correcting the condition that caused the wheel to come out of true.The impact didnt suddenly loosentighten a bunch of spokes by turning nipples.  It forcibly bent the rim meaning the relatively even spoke tension you had before now doesnt hold the rim in center because there are new forces involved.  You can see this in the truing stand find a spot where the rim is to one side and note the spokes. Say the rim is now veering to the Non drive side of the wheels centerline. Normally to true a wheel from that condition youd loosen a non drive side spoke and tighten a drive side spoke. But instead your impactbent rim now already had that non drive spoke pretty loose and the drive side spoke higher than normal. Adjusting spoke tension will only make it more extreme.As uncomfortable as it might seem correcting this means hitting it the other direction. Make sure you have a tire installed and pumped up fund the spot on the rim where it seems most it of true hold the wheel sideways at an angle to the floor with that spot lined up but reversed and slap it firmly.  A lot of times Ive done this and it makes the wheel almost perfectly true again but if you get it so it only has a tiny wobble you can then fine tune via spokes. ,bikewrench,d713le7,2,t5_2sje0

10631552,0,t1_ddcar59,When the derailleur swings out to the big gear it moves up and away. When measuring height you are measuring the gap between the big ring teeth and the bottom outside edge of the chain guide. They are telling you it should be directly above because this is the position where you need to measure it. You need to pivot the chain guide out like its shifting to the big ring and when the outside edge of the guide is over the big ring you measure the gap between the bottom of the guide and the top of the teeth. If its too close you have to move the derailluer up on the frame and if its too far away you have to move it down on the frame.In your picture youre measuring the gap between the teeth and the derailleur BUT it needs to be swung out away from the frame like you are shifting into the big ring when you measure. If the chain guide wont swing far enough away to go over the big gear you should make sure the high limit screw isnt keeping it from moving out far enough. ,bikewrench,ddckb0l,1,t5_2sje0

There are plenty of real world examples where the sleeves loosen up Pacenti SLv rims for example and the rims continue to perform perfectly except for the annoying rattling from the loose sleeve.Welding rim joints is more about aesthetics and smoothing the joint in the brake track than it is about strength. The rim will bend at loads far lower than what it takes to cause movement at the rim joint of a properly tensioned wheel. So yes the welded rim may be technically stronger but not in a way that provides a meaningful benefit and not in a way where weakening a portion of the weld will materially increase the risk of riding failure.,bikewrench,de5ri1d,1,t5_2sje0

11340407,0,t3_61tx23,From what i can see online it looks like the chain stays are bolted to the dropouts and then painted over this was how old Look frames were made as well. You may be able to remove the fasteners and install longer ones to bolt the lower mounts directly to this connection inside the frame if there is clearance or outside with a small spacer to clear the chain stay insert.,bikewrench,dfheysp,2,t5_2sje0
11354865,0,t3_61ss1q,TRP CX are the brakes specifically meant for anything New Super SLR or newer.  That would include levers like the ST ST STR and indeed your ST.  You would use CX. for older levers like ST.As for differences for Super SLR New Super and SLREV it is not about absolute pull ratios but in the ramp rate throughout the stroke.  A linear pull brake isnt as tunebale for ramp rate.Shimano themselves say that all road brake leverscalipers New Super SLR and newer are crosscompatible,bikewrench,dfj1x1m,2,t5_2sje0

11641636,0,t3_663or5,If youre very lucky i.e. bike has always been stored in a climate controlled or arid environment the various penetrating oils might help. But with  years of galvanic corrosion chances are high that youre going to have to resort to destructive methods. The only two that are virtually guaranteed to work are  section the post with a hacksaw blade and  dissolve it with sodium hydroxide on the Sheldon Brown page. Ive done both.  is faster and safer but labor intensive.  is slow and slightly hazardous to the mechanic but doesnt take much effort once you get the setup figured out.Good luck. A truly stuck seatpost will literally destroy the frame before it yields to brute force.

11717241,0,t3_676lc9,Sometimes with newish cranks you have to clear out the threads with a tap before using the crank puller.  The ParkTool crank pullers are ok its paint or anodizing goobering your threads.  Clear em out and get that tool fully inserted before you torque on it.  Partial insertion could cause you to tear the threads out of the crankarm.BTW the tech at your LBS did right by torquing the crank bolts good.  nm is recommended for square taper and thats really pretty snug.  A  hex wrench is actually kinda short for the job and might explain the bike shaking in the stand.  I prefer a  Pedros mm w ergonomic handle or of course a torque wrench.  Also there is a good chance your chain is stretched out a bit but the only way to know is with a gauge.  Cleaning and lubing the chain are great but youve probably put enough miles on that one to wear it out.  Ask the guys at the shop to measure it for you and if its past the point where its worn out replace the cassette too.  The squeaking may or may not be your BB but have them check that out too.  ,bikewrench,dgo6fni,2,t5_2sje0

11739980,0,t3_67iunr,Very very very bad idea. Youll notice NO ONE makes radiallylaced disc brake wheels. Thats because the spokes are the only thing that can transmit force between the rim and the hub. Its the same reason you dont see purely radial rear wheels. Also Shimano even goes a step further recommending which spokes should be elbows inelbows out when building disc brake wheels Basically trailing spokes are elbows in head out except for the rear drive side which helps prevent the chain from jamming if it were to jump off the largest cog into the spokes.,bikewrench,dgqr8z0,11,t5_2sje0
