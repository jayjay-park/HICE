59002,0,t3_1urh8i,I love Oz.  I rewatch all the time on HBO Go.I love watching early episodes of Law and Order SVU and seeing half the cast of oz showing up as guest stars.  It was great to see Meloni and Lee Tergesen face off again.  ,hbo,cel5cdn,2,t5_2r1a0

1780433,0,t3_2ew4d3,I can only speak for myself here but the show bored me. I dont need vampires dragons or Tommy guns  but I do need something to motivate me. I need something exciting to happen.I watched about  episodes and just wasnt feeling it. I found myself playing on my phone missing big chunks and not even caring.I think it started off way too slow to pull me in. It was all just too somber for me. It might pick up after a few episodes but I just wasnt willing to invest any more time in it. ,hbo,ck3kt8p,16,t5_2r1a0
1869611,0,t1_ckegmi7,I think the show will catch on. I was close to giving up on it after watching the first two or three episodes but it has really picked up since then. The last few episodes have been excellent.,hbo,ckehchm,1,t5_2r1a0

3943249,0,t3_35le1n,Yes. Ive had onoff issues with connection and buffering despite fast internet but my biggest issue is with HBO Go app interface. UserX fucking sucks its worse than a root canal. Clunkiest piece of trash Ive ever used. Netflix blows it out of the water.I love HBO but theyre doing a really good job of testing that with their terrible appsservice.,hbo,cr5ril0,1,t5_2r1a0

7451232,0,t3_4gb982,I have yet to experience HBO Now in HD. The compression is pathetic and really an insult to viewers who pay a monthly premium for the service. Somehow Amazon Netflix Vudo and others have all figured out how to stream in HD. Its not ground breaking. HBO needs to get this addressed or Ill be cancelling shortly.,hbo,d2p5pca,1,t5_2r1a0
