6151768,0,t1_cyoupkr,Im just a regular guy with a  job as a web developer that lost a lot of money in the  crash  technically. I just like many people only heard what the main stream media reported and had confirmation bias as my reasoning that after the market dropped in  now was a good time to get back in only to have it bottom out a few months later in . I lost a  of my portfolio in just a few months and that was after buying name brand companies. Not yoloing like we do here. I didnt know anything... I just bought in because everyone was saying now was a good time. I had no info and only  view point in my head that I thought represented the sum of whole. It cost me a lot. So I sold everything I had left and havent reentered the markets until last September  years later. All of this time I sat on the side lines and did lots research to figure out why everything was happening opposite of what I expected I consider my self a smart guy but man was I wrong and why no one else knew until it was too late. I was dumb founded by the normalcy bias presented by the people I thought to be experts that talk about it on newsmoney mediums. How could everyone be so wrong? Well after a lot of searching I found that there actually were a lot of people that were aware something was wrong and they were trying to tell everyone. Years in advance these people predicted the housing crisis and the dot com bubble and the results that would follow. Its just that those people werent on TV or in major new outlets or when they were they were ridiculed as if what they had to say was tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist ideas. Well those people turned out to be right so I watched every video these guys put out past and present and read every article. Saved every blog and every YouTube channel and followed them daily to help me build a new understanding. I learned where money comes from and how our monetary system works and the flaws built into it and what that means to our future. The crash is a certain thing. its  going to happen. Its only the timing that no one can manage to figure out which is why bears have been wrong for the last  years and made fun of. Well now everything is coming to head and the cracks are starting to appear. I know for certain this year is the start. I cant possibly quantify my reasoning beyond the snippets I type in these comments because its a massive amount of info. To help everyone I posted this thread a few weeks ago but just as always. the bears get made fun of. I suggest taking some time to watch the videos and check out the YouTube channels I posted. They will help tremendously in understanding why I keep telling everyone. A crash is coming.,wallstreetbets,cyow4jz,1,t5_2th52

6184229,0,t1_cysex6v,They definitely do advertise a  day free trial on the thinkorswim website. Thats how I originally opened mine about a month ago.After dicking around with thinkorswim for a while today and opening a new roth heres how I think it works. If you open a thinkorswim account using the  day free trial link you create a new TDAmeritrade login which is linked to two gimped papermoney accounts. You cant log in to the normal TDA website with this login but you can log into the thinkorswim apps. You also cannot link this gimped account with any actual TDA accounts.However it seems that every actual TDA account comes with its own set of fake papermoney accounts as well. When I logged into thinkorswim with my new roth it logged out my old papermoney accounts and replaced them with two new papermoney accounts with a clean k and no positions. What remains to be seen If I link my roth TDA account with another actual TDA account will I then have  papermoney accounts or just two? And if I yolo too hard and lose the k that each papermoney account comes with how do I get more yolofunds besides the obvious open a new actual IRA direct transfer assets over then close the old one? But regardless of whether the  day trial is real or not Id imagine that my roths papertrade accounts arent subject to this. So if anyone ever hits that  day trial it only takes  minutes to open an actual account with TDA and then Id imagine you get unlimited papertrading at that point. Ill find out in  days.I only go through so much trouble because I really really love thinkorswim for papertrading. Such an awesome service especially on iOS. ,wallstreetbets,cyskzir,1,t5_2th52

6194218,0,t1_cyt6woe,To preface I dont completely agree with OP or your stance on Apple. You make points that are all true and OP should take note of. Your stance does not take into account the possibilityprobability Apple gets intocreates a new niche in the tech market. You are right about the declining costs of laptops phones etc. that  years ago were out of many customers price range but now props up Apples revenue while its costs and demand are decreasing. So yes tech in their current products cant advance too much more and market saturation hurts them but you do not care at all in your post about the next big product for Apple. If OP buys Apple not because of the success of the iPhone but buys on the confidence Apple will be a market leader I think it is a good buy. But if OP is buying because he thinks the iPhone will continue increase stock price that is a bad trade in my opinion. I completely agree Apple will remain bearish but there will be a time soon that will become a great time to enter in Apple long. The change in the cable tv business model is coming and if Apple is smart they will spend some of that small cash pile they have and take control of the market when it shifts to an alacarte pay model. I believe Apple will take that market which will make up and advance the stock even with even with a drop in iPhone revenue within the next few years. ,wallstreetbets,cytptpw,1,t5_2th52

6281167,0,t3_41knq2,What is often called leverage decay is just compounding with a pejorative name. If you have a positive return then the following returns will be exaggerated relative to the base. Conversely if you have a negative return then the following returns will be damped relative to the base. So in particular negative return followed by positive return will dampen the positive return and a positive return followed by a negative return will exaggerate the negative return.Leverage is not really the root cause the root cause is that compounding is a more powerful force when returns are bigger in magnitude. It doesnt matter that the magnitude of the returns is artificially inflated by leverage.Of course you need to be aware that compounding in the negative direction also happens for the sake of risk management but did anyone really think that they could get onedirectional compounding? If your leveraged ETF tracks x the underlying ETF daily then it cant track the underlying with x return over longer periods because the effects of compounding will quickly make them diverge. Ignoring fees you can actually get rid of leverage decay if you want by doing daily rebalancing. Every day take  of your daily return out of the leveraged ETF and if you lost money add  of your loss to the leveraged ETF. That way your PampL will always be x the underlying ETFs PampL. Of course expense ratio will still be an issue as will failure to track the underlying for other reasons.Also the idea that  return is the opposite of  return is incorrect and I dont know why people keep expecting it to be the case. When you average returns you should average according to the geometric mean not the arithmetic mean. The opposite of  is .  . whereas the opposite of  is .  ..,wallstreetbets,cz3ljx9,2,t5_2th52

An Xbox currently sells for  but you dont have the money right now to buy it. You think the price of the xbox is going up to  next month. Your friend works at BestBuy and says he has a raincheck that allows you to buy the Xbox for  but the raincheck expires next month. He offers to sell you the raincheck for .When you buy his raincheck for  you are locking in the right to buy the Xbox for . It is like an option because it locks in the purchase price it has an expiration date it locks in a purchase price and it is not mandatory that you redeem it.Thats an explanation for a call option in kids terms. For more easy answers to the question what is a call option click now.A put can be answered in a similar way. Suppose you bought the Xbox for  and then the price drops back to . If you keep your receipt you have the right to return sell the Xbox back for  even though the current price is only . Bestbuy has a  day return policy so your receipt is like a put option in that you can sell the Xbox back for a price higher than the current market price.Source Another example is the followingPut Down  when you think a stock is going to go downCall Up  when you think a stock is going to go up.,wallstreetbets,d029xqy,2,t5_2th52

Market cap of B.At the current estimate of . per share earnings Nike should go to a B market cap all other things remaining equal.  That translates to a share price of ..In order to hit that market cap with their forward guidance they  need to hit .share in earnings or a  increase in earnings.  Theyve hit it in the past but will they do it in the coming year?  If you change the PE ratio to say their historic high of about . in November  you get to a market cap of B or share but they need to have forward guidance of . earnings in the coming year.  A little harder to hit at  yoy increase.  Even so if their guidance is around .share I believe they will hit  and stay there.  In the end it depends on forward guidance.If Nike goes much beyond  Id buy puts and if I can get into it at  Ill be buying calls.

I cant see how people are getting short after we rallied off the lows from feb and are sitting within reach of  all the while Janet is sounding a tad bit more dovish if we take a look at the front end of the curve hikes have been completely priced out to December so much for two hikes this year right.   There is not a world where she hikes before sept if you wanna see this market lower then hope we get some killer data and even then she probably wont move brexit risk into summer election a few months later.

7403819,0,t1_d2jr08n,No I havent tried it yet.  Would love to but too expensive.  Which is part of my point a lot of early adopters get lost in the magic of VR but dont quite realize that theyre putting up with hurdles that WOULD stop many people from purchasing these things exorbitant price exorbitant required specs discomfort nausea etc.My point is that if VR really is earth shattering why arent there people lined up to acquire this?  Why arent there campouts and press articles extolling the amazing virtues of VR?  Sure you can find positive feedback from both users and press but this isnt on the level that something like the iPhone  was upon release.VR is neat sure but its not yet a revolution.  It needs to be drastically cheaper and more accessible before that day comes.Do I want to own a VR headset?  Desperately.  I live for games and it seems like a fantastic way to play them but it takes more than raw tech for something to change the world.  There will eventually be a tipping point where VR becomes a household item but we arent there yet and there will probably be casualties along the way.  The VIVE isnt going to send HTC to the moon the user experience is too narrowniche.IMO the first company thats going to ride the VR train to moonville is going to be the one that makes VR cheap and accessible.  I think Samsung is on the right track with the GearVR but even that is limited to Samsung headsets.  When Apple or Google jumps onboard then were talking but even they are so big that VR will account for only a drop in their respective revenue buckets.Then again after AAPLs bloodbath today they could use a boost lol...,wallstreetbets,d2jrkmx,2,t5_2th52

7639262,0,t3_4jy4re,Interesting bits for general economygtParticipants generally agreed that the risks to the economic outlook posed by global economic and financial developments had receded over the intermeeting period. The public appeared to have interpreted Federal Reserve communications following the March FOMC meeting as indicating that achieving the Committees economic objectives would likely require a somewhat more gradual pace of increases in the federal funds rate than anticipated earlier. The shift in policy expectations along with incoming data showing that economic growth abroad picked up during the first quarter of the year seemed to contribute to the improved tone in global financial markets. Several FOMC participants judged that the risks to the economic outlook were now roughly balanced. However many others indicated that they continued to see downside risks to the outlook either because of concerns that the recent slowdown in domestic spending might persist or because of remaining concerns about the global economic and financial outlook. Some participants noted that global financial markets could be sensitive to the upcoming British referendum on membership in the European Union or to unanticipated developments associated with Chinas management of its exchange rate....gtStill with month PCE inflation continuing to run below the Committees  percent objective a number of participants judged that it would be appropriate to proceed cautiously in removing policy accommodation. Some participants pointed to the risk that the recent weak data on domestic spending could reflect a loss of momentum in the economy that might hinder further gains in the labor market and raise the likelihood that inflation could fail to increase as expected. Accordingly these participants believed that it would be important to evaluate whether incoming information was consistent with their expectation that economic growth would pick up and thus support continued improvement in the labor market. In addition a number of participants judged that the risks to the outlook for inflation remained tilted to the downside in light of low readings on measures of inflation compensation and the fall over the past year in some survey measures of longerterm inflation expectations. Also many participants noted that downside risks emanating from developments abroad while reduced still warranted close monitoring. For these reasons participants generally saw maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at  to  percent at this meeting and continuing to assess developments carefully as consistent with setting policy in a datadependent manner and as leaving open the possibility of an increase in the federal funds rate at the June FOMC meeting.gtSome participants saw limited costs to maintaining a patient posture at this meeting but noted the risksincluding potential risks to financial stabilityof waiting too long to resume the process of removing policy accommodation especially given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy. A couple of participants were concerned that further postponement of action to raise the federal funds rate might confuse the public about the economic considerations that influence the Committees policy decisions and potentially erode the Committees credibility.gtA few participants judged it appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting citing their assessments that downside risks associated with global economic and financial developments had diminished substantially since early this year that labor market conditions were consistent with the Committees maximumemployment objective and that inflation was likely to rise this year toward the Committees  percent objective. Two participants noted that several standard policy benchmarks such as a number of interest rate rules and some measures of the equilibrium real interest rate continued to imply values for the federal funds rate well above the current target range. Such large and persistent deviations of the federal funds rate from these benchmarks in their view posed a risk that the removal of policy accommodation was proceeding too slowly and that the Committee might in the future find it necessary to raise the federal funds rate quickly to combat inflation pressures potentially unduly disrupting economic or financial activity. Overly accommodative policy could also induce imprudent risktaking in financial markets posing additional risks to achieving the Committees goals in the future.gtParticipants agreed that their ongoing assessments of the data and other incoming information as well as the implications for the outlook would determine the timing and pace of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy. Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter labor market conditions continuing to strengthen and inflation making progress toward the Committees  percent objective then it likely would be appropriate for the Committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June. Participants expressed a range of views about the likelihood that incoming information would make it appropriate to adjust the stance of policy at the time of the next meeting. Several participants were concerned that the incoming information might not provide sufficiently clear signals to determine by midJune whether an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted. Some participants expressed more confidence that incoming data would prove broadly consistent with economic conditions that would make an increase in the target range in June appropriate. Some participants were concerned that market participants may not have properly assessed the likelihood of an increase in the target range at the June meeting and they emphasized the importance of communicating clearly over the intermeeting period how the Committee intends to respond to economic and financial developments.,wallstreetbets,d3ajidr,1,t5_2th52

Investopedia puts those restrictions on because they cant afford to pay for real time quotes and they dont want people cheating by looking at real time quotes. If you were trading SPY  put expiring June rd it would fill quite quickly if you opted to pay the ask price as theres volume on both sides and fairly liquid. But if you were trading   puts youd probably have to wait a while for the order to fill because nobody wants to fucking sell those well some people might but thats another story ,wallstreetbets,d3j93ho,1,t5_2th52

Prior to world war  multi generation living was the norm not the exception. It was only the post war economic boom that allowed people to afford independent living. With the end of that boom along with increases  in rent health care and student loan debt has forced a return to historical norms. And there is nothing wrong with that. Imagine three generations all living together. Monthly expenses can be spread between four people instead of two. Retired parents can take over child care duties instead of paying for daycare. Cooking can also be handled by the older generation. In return the grand parents get companionship and the security of knowing that their needs are being met by their children.

The Greece issue is not solved by any means and will pop up again soon that usually takes  points off the market. Other EU members will now push for a referendum they definitely want it and if a central country like Belgium votes out absolute carnage will ensue.This  brexit  is an absolutely huge thing that will change the fabric of Europe much more than expected.I was very confident it would happen  unlike the trash you posted prebrexit about young people voting for out do you read any news at all???  and got ES puts and am very happy.

8360335,0,t1_d5mb0sj,thats just wrong. you think people who are long puts went in and sold millions of dollars of stock to drive it lower then exercised the puts to sell even more stock? Theyll just end up short tons of stock at a price that they artificially lowered and have to move the market even more as it will be less liquid to buy it back later.  If you want further evidence that youre wrong the guy who bought  Jul nd  puts yesterday sold out of all of them around  today and stock is still down big. The impact from the big put buyer yesterday is totally gone now.  Heres my best guess at the truth and Im a pro options tradermarket maker that trades a little bit of PYPLWhen PYPL moved up earnings to coincide with Visas there was a ton of takeover speculation  partnership speculation and call buying Oct  Aug  Jul  which jacked up the price of stock. Then when the partnership was announced along with good numbers stock immediately went up since the deal happened and the first reaction is positive. Later people got more info on the deal and realized PYPL didnt make some kind of great deal thats a huge winwin. The deal was probably neither a winner or loser and there is now a lower probability of a takeover than there was yesterday. As people digested that info they sold stock back to where it was before all the speculation.  ,wallstreetbets,d5mle3o,9,t5_2th52

8455491,0,t1_d5xe2zs,The fracking industry would be related to the services. Alot of the fracking is for Natural gas which prices are nearing  currently. The EampP companies are going to keep their production going as they have tremendous debt and they need to sell gas or risk defaulting on loans. Its a big bubble thatll pop if these prices fall out again. IMO I would be looking for something to happen in the way of demand side to trigger a buy in any company in the oil and gas EampP side. For the services I would be looking at the rig count and who has got rigs drilling. Most states require the wells to be fracked after a set amount of years after drilling so they will likely be fracking them as well once they are drilled regardless of price.

9086238,0,t1_d83rucs,The reason this works so well is because when you short a callput you make money if the stock stays at the same price or moves in your favor.  If youre long a callput then you only make money if the price moves in the right direction. Also time decay works in your favor and if you sell when volatility is high then you make money when volatility gets crushed earnings playThe downside to this strategy is it requires more capital than a long call or put. This isnt a big deal because if you are lacking capital you can short a callput spread. sell a callput and buy a further out of the money callput.  This limits your downside risk at the expense of collecting less premium. ,wallstreetbets,d840pkn,2,t5_2th52

Stocks are never going to be  safe but if youre comfortable with  a year returns on X of your portfolio it makes sense to set aside some of your funds in an index fund.  Personally I keep about  of my stocks in index funds and play around with the remaining .gtHow badly will some of their funds and whatnot be affected by sharp swings in the market to the up or downsideCompletely depends on the fund. Obviously if you invest in a finance ETF and financials go belly up youre more fucked than if you had invested in a broadmarket ETF. I personally use SampP index funds because its diversified across sectors. But it will essentially mirror swings in the market.gtheaven forbid a full market crash? It doesnt really matter which sectorfund you choose if that happens. If youre in any stocks youre fucked.  Thankfully full crashes dont happen very often.gtShould I wait for the dip or will they be relatively unaffected and may as will get in now?Trying to time the market for index funds is stupid because theyre so diversified already your downsideupside risk is close to zero for a week period or whatever.  If youre talking about whats going to happen after the election no one really knows what the market is going to do so you may as well enter.disengage faggotryThat being said youre a complete faggot for not YOLOing your entire portfolio.

9144981,0,t3_55b3ux,Not always a good idea it depends on if the stock is over subscribed or under subscribed to by pensionmutualhedge funds and other investment companies. When the investment bank is underwriting the IPO theyll name an issue price and hold an auction essentially. If the funds like this stock then itll blast off on IPO day whereas if they have trouble unloading preIPO shares then itll most likely drop. The real science of it comes down to where the IB prices it at. If the stock moves way to high say a  gain on IPO day then they left a TON of money on the table when selling shares to other funds. If it moves way lower then they did a bad job of pricing and might even have trouble underwriting IPOs in the future. Supply and demand my friend. ,wallstreetbets,d8b6x0o,2,t5_2th52

9242138,0,t3_56ynpp,The latest build on IB sucks. Ive had some bizarre red exclamation mark in my daily PL which after a lot of research I think means it cant value certain assets mousing over it doesnt do anything nothing found by Googling no mention of it in TWS manual or orientation video notes. The only way I discovered what it might mean was by going back to the old classic interface.I have nothing exotic in my portfolio to explain why daily PLs are missing for some holdings. I was experimenting with buying combos through the strategy builder rather than buying each leg individually. Less of a margin impact but of course the fills suck down  right off the bat. Would be nice to set limits for each leg but I dont see a way to do that in SB. There probably is a way but there is nothing intuitive about any of these interfaces and there are just so many windows and features many of which are redundant.You also have to use the older interface to place some orders like a trail limit the option just doesnt appear in Mosaic. In fact there are a ton of order choices that just dont exist in Mosaic. No idea why.If I open my TWS prior to market open the PL on my options wont be correct after trading starts.

Thats not the fucking issue here.What matters is that the shareholders approve the deal that the board agreed to. Larry Ellison is not allowed to vote with his shares because he has an obvious conflict of interest. So T Rowe who owns something like  of the total outstanding shares meaning they own  of the unaffiliated shares can swing their dick in Larrys face and basically block the tender offer. They wrote a letter to the other shareholders advising them not to tender. If just half of those shareholders say no in addition to T Rowes  the deal fails. Oracle has said they wont raise the offer. And T Rowe is probably right that Netsuite is better off as a standalone company than as a part of Oracle.Im long OTM puts and OTM calls. I just bought the calls this morning because they were cheap enough to provide decent insurance at the right price. If Oracle goes against their word and raises the offer to anywhere above  I make money. If the deal falls through entirely and the stock plummets I make money.

It may have assets worth tons of money but if they cant find a buyer the assets are effectively worthless. What happens if the cost to move the assets is too high?

If I had sold ALL my positions and bought into JNUG I would be up   this year.And I dont currently have a position with some insane  or something like that because of Dividends and reinvestmentscontributions. I buy and hold  of my positions and reinvest and recontribute quarterly or regularly. I cullshave losers and laggers follow market shifts and trends.

The likely Fed rate hike is just one piece of information that factors into the equation. gtAnyone with any sense on to know why that the gold been holding these levels? Because the momentum in the postelection market movement is slowing. Gold stopped dropping when the postelection paniceuphoria eased up. The Trump election started a movement out of safehaven assets such as bonds and precious metals and into riskier assets especially industrial stocks. This can be seen in one of the largest bondselloffs in years. As bond prices drop yields rise and become more attractive putting pressure on precious metals. After an initial waterfalllike drop the downhill momentum has slowed but it is still rolling. Chart is  weeks old but this illustrates my point see the sharp reversal at the far right.  yr treasury yield versus Gold    ,wallstreetbets,datmrs6,5,t5_2th52

Then after a few years you realize youve put x dollars into it and its grown  or so. Not to mention they pay dividends so every few months they pay you just for having the stock.Its not a flashy way to invest.

10049813,0,t3_5jnalw,I tried to get unbanned from personal finance while i stayed on the sidelines for some trades and held some pharmas cause theyre riding well.But personal finance said that even if it was christmas im not well regarded and that based on my posts on other forums I would not be unbanned. I think they are judging me because I post here but this sub reddit has been so good to me. Teaching me along the way and helping me lose money with dignity. I have made money in most cases but still when its lost at least i can think to my self when i am penniless in bali at least i did it at least i put k in play because it could turn into a million and we all rich. Sry im listening to the maadcity album. Im dissapointed though. Its like growing up in a poor neighborhood and people think you are going to jack them for their shoes so theystart walking faster as you try to just say hello. Make a meaningful connection. But the only connection I make is with this young teen gf and the mercedes in my drive way. Is it true? Is it being an idiot smarty pants something that draws the ire of more conventional people? Its like being a fish out of water. I wonder if i take the aggressive positions that at times would ruin me are a way to flirt with the fact that i think i can make it back but if i dont at least i never forgot my friend and neighbors and the people who are real.Edit i did the paragraphs. I hope the death threats will stop now.,wallstreetbets,dbhilb5,7,t5_2th52

10251125,0,t1_dc5qv91,What youre missing is that he didnt BUY calls he sold or wrote them. When you write a call youre selling someone the right to purchase the shares exercise the call at the strike price on or before the expiration date. This is in contrast to buying a call where you are buying this right.  In this case because he owns the underlying shares this is called a covered call.Specifically he wrote  February rd calls for the  strike price. At the time these calls were selling for .share. Hence he made .. This is called the premium. In the best case scenario the price of the underlying shares goes up but never reaches share before  Feb. In this case he will pocket the  premium as well as the stock gains and hell keep his shares because the contract wont be exercised.In another case the stock price soars above  before the strike date. The contracts will most likely be exercised and hell be given an exercise notice saying his  shares have been sold for  each. Hell still have made over  k from the stock gains  premium but since he no longer owns the shares hell miss out on any further gains.In the final scenario if the stock falls below its current price hell keep his shares and hell at least have  profit to offset some of the loss.Faggot.,wallstreetbets,dc60s5b,9,t5_2th52

So if you buy Yahoo put options at  speaking very simply you will profit when Yahoo is below  and lose money if Yahoo is above . Your loss is limited to the premium paid however.. Sell call options  By selling the call option you agree to sell to the options buyer shares of Yahoo at the agreed upon strike. You collect a premium for this. Speaking simply if you sell  calls you keep the premium and lose nothing if Yahoo is below  and you begin to lose money if Yahoo breaks above . Those are two ways to make money off of a stock going down without holding any stock in the first place. There are more ways but those are the simplest.

Apple has been ahead of the market for decades why do you really think they released a shit phone? You cant honestly believe something as diabolical as the iPhone  is actually for the company to grow on?      Theyre most likely using this marketing ploy to drop share price so they can pick up on a new innovation path. They even work on DrivingAI. Also if you got Brexit and the presidency wrong you have no idea what youre doing in regards to economics demographics finance and markets. You should just buy shit you believe in and not look back.     Youre too greedy and have no will to improve your analytical skill with knowledge and training your intuition. Youll make money from this trade but not from the reasons youll think of. Youll be gaining false confidence from this trade and lose it all. Save my comment do a remindme for  years PM me and Ill reply saying I told you so. OP youre a fool you need a financial advisor and spread your money over  firms.

10586131,0,t1_dd7repg,Google defines it as a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production distribution and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.Sounds to me like its an economic system that gives people free stuff. It ignores the investment and innovation of entrepreneurs and distributes their money to everyone. If everyone owns the means of production theres no incentive for me to make anything new because that money will go towards social programs and even a basic income. Why would I want to make a revolutionary new product if the government is just going to take a large percentage of it? Im not an anarchist or small government libertarian whatsoever I just believe that socialism increases the incentive to be a lazy fuck living off the government and decreases the incentive to work hard and make peoples lives better.I think pure capitalism is just as bad as pure socialism but lets not sit here and talk about how great socialism is. The best system we have so far is a mixed economy that heavily leans towards capitalism.,wallstreetbets,dd7vmfi,3,t5_2th52

Sure some big media outlets will dump millions into it and its neat that you can create geofenced filters but I dont see widespread adoption happening there.

There is extra cost built into the option for time and volatility so you need the stock to move fastfar enough in the right direction or the volatility to increase high enough for the decay in value due to timevolatility crush. By selling calls hes could be betting that Tesla wont be at that price or above at expiration. stock falls or doesnt move he wins that Teslas volatility is going to significantly reduce making the options worth less so he can buy them back earnings coming up that hes bearish on market trouble smoothing out legal decision or lawsuit coming etc,wallstreetbets,de34rhs,6,t5_2th52

11128147,0,t1_detc3x4,yes you are correct. usually the report has either a positive or negative outcome on the stock price the day after its released depending on if the company beat the analysts estimated result. So if consensus among analysts is that company X will make . profit per share in Q  and the company reports they made . profit the stock price will sky rocket as they beat the expectations as long as this wasnt priced in already by super optimistic investors. Other way around if they didnt meet the expectations... Bought a bunch of Adidas stock  days before earnings this week as i had reason to believe they where gonna have a really nice quarter behind them.

This is why I stay away from companies like AMD  if a year old company cant maintain a reasonably clean balance sheet AND cant manage to turn a profit then in my humble opinion there is a problem no matter how compelling the companys forward outlook.

I have  friends on FB majority are millennjals and I see AT MOST  my day posts per day aka FB stories usually no one posts anything.

11308631,0,t1_dfdt92v,I am seriously confused where they grow from here.They have  million daily active users in North America. Theyre pretty much only popular in the youth population maybe up to  and I dont see that changing. I did the math and in the US there is only a total of something like  million people between the ages of  again being optimistic with the up to  figure. Then if you consider how many actually own smartphones and how many people actually care to use stuff like this then you can see that Snapchat have nearly captured everyone in the US.And when you consider that the US market is literally x more profitable than the rest of the world their growth in Europe doesnt even matter much they make . cents per user in Europe whereas its . in the US. I also dont see much growth in Europe regardless especially with whatsapp a very popular app in Europe copying Snapchats features.More users is also costly in itself since the fact that its very videoimage driven means a ton of bandwidth. So the only real growth I see with Snapchat is increasing their revenue per user. They so far have done this very well and I think they still have room to grow. But they would have to about double their revenue without any new costs to just break even. I think they will perhaps do this next year. So they .x like eMarketer projects them to and then they somehow double up again in . Assuming further their costs dont go up false for sure that puts their revenue at m.  m expenses  . billion net profit a year. I dont know enough about how they will manage to get  revenue per user because I dont know how fully they integrated their ad services yet. One big problem is that a lot of the ad services they sell Discover ads for example are limited in number. It seems like theyd have to increase the number of ads by displaying the video ads but that has the limit of dont piss off users especially when theres a bunch of other competitors,wallstreetbets,dfdte77,3,t5_2th52

The government at least has a democratic legitimation and at least it is officially obliged to act in favor of the people while private companies are only loyal to their shareholders.Of course governments consist of humans and humans tend to abuse their power. Hence its important to have as much transparency and public supervision as possible the exact opposite of what the USA with their dozens of secret agencies represent. Also the economy is ideally both private and public domain. Some services should not be provided by forprofit companies while others should definitely not be handled by the government. Some markets can even be a mix of both i.e. a private market and also some kind of public basic provision e.g. health care public transport water electricity.,wallstreetbets,dftnesn,2,t5_2th52

11563156,0,t1_dg6nu1j,gtUnless literally the entire US government crashes the value of the USD will never be that volatileNow you are only talking about degree of risk which concedes your original argument that shorting is ridiculous because you are selling something you dont own. Now you have changed to the position that buying on credit which is basically shorting the dollar is not as risky even though it is the exact same kind of risk because the USD will never be that volatile.. That does not matter. There are a lot of investment options out there at all risk levels and just because something has higher risk does not make it inherently wrong or ridiculous.. The USD can be plenty volatile. FOREX currency trading is probably a lot riskier than shorting a stock in many cases. Stocks CAN shoot up in value but they almost never do. ,wallstreetbets,dg6osym,1,t5_2th52

11602322,0,t3_65ju1q,I dont get why Shkreli beats around the bush. He has profited off raising the price of the drug passing that cost off either directly to the consumer who need it or indirectly through healthcare which leads to rising premiums for everyone negatively influencing more lives but to a lesser degree.While he does provide the drug for those who dont have healthcare that prerequisite does create a dilemma of choosing between the lifesaving drug or potentially lifesaving healthcare for a specific subset of individuals.Shkreli needs to own up to what he does instead of hiding behind its just a tiny percent. Those are peoples lives man.I say this as an electrical engineer who decided to go into defense. Literally profiting off the ability to work on multihundred million dollar flying death machines to kill bad guys.Percentages are a psychological cog for those who dont want to deal with details of system they are working with.

They were very basic could only shoot video and only connected to Snapchat but shot in a circle instead of a rectangle which allowed a viewer to rotate their smartphone to see more of the shot.Right now you can buy them online but for the first month they were only available in one popup spectacles vending machine that they moved around the country. After about a month they opened a popup store in downtown NYC which had two of the vending machines and you could buy it there.

Could very easily be wrong and Im biased against seagate for shit hardware over the years.  Many of the datacenters actually avoid their hardware all together because of failure rates.  These days storage in the enterprise I feel goes to WDC hitachi and intelmicron the later for SSDs.  Thought STX was still the largest producer of hard drives... must have missed the news.Also maybe dont explain things options traders should know  youre really letting newbies think they know how to avoid traps  simply saying to avoid IV crush would be all thats warranted and probably better they read up on it properly. I dont think its a good idea to pick the expiration dates or strike prices because things fluctuate too fast for static text to keep up with and youre likely setting newbies up for more lost capital if things dont work out.  The formality of the report feels also very awkward to WSB not that a good report should be... overall feels weird man . ,wallstreetbets,dgr83er,2,t5_2th52

11752117,0,t1_dgs40jk,I cant remember the specifics. It was on Tim Howards blog. I think his plan was for them to be completely released from government control. End NWS. The retained earnings for the first couple years would all go straight to the capital cushion. Then when the stock price stabilizes the government will use its warrants. Half the proceeds can go to capitalization essentially a free gift to the companies. Half can go to straight to the US Treasury. The dilution argument is way overblown on this subreddit. You have to remember. The government has no incentive to dilute its own position. It benefits from a high stock price just as much common shareholders do. The higher the share price the more  they make when they convert their warrants. It makes no sense for the government to screw over the common shareholders and then convert their warrants at share. Theyd only make a few billion dollars which is nothing in the grand scheme of things. Im biased but I strongly believe many will miss this rocket ship to the moon because they are too heavy in the preferred shares. ,wallstreetbets,dgs4rf7,2,t5_2th52
