672317,0,t3_21uqrh,I see this photo and I imagine being the cameraman holding onto something stable behind me for dear life. Somehow I bobble the camera slightly and in my effort to stabilize it it slips from my grasp. I reach forward trying to grab it and the hand holding me in place slips from whatever I was holding as I lean forward just an inch too far.,kindaterrifying,cggox2n,0,t5_30wbe
