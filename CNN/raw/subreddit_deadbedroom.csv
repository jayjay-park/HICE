6055880,0,t1_cy75svd,I kind of thought about the same thing. My husband and I have what is probably a pretty average sex life in that we have ups and downs. If one of us isnt feeling as confident lately it kind of bleeds into the bedroom. When I gained weight my DESIRE didnt decrease but I didnt feel sexy so the act of sex wasnt appealing. Alot of my enjoyment of sex is in HIS reactions to me. I want to feel sexy. I masturbated much more frequently too... it was  not him it was just  easier. And it was temporary some thing that passed when I finally started to get back in shape and feel better about myself. Hes had those moments too over the  years weve been together. Its not completely impossible that her confidence could be a big player in the problem. The answer to that isnt super simple though. She may need to invest more time into herself and address health or even just pamper herself and love herself the way she is a little bit. If this is even the issue of course.,deadbedroom,cydf9ww,1,t5_2wk69
6274663,0,t1_cz1zdic,Ok condoms are there for a reason. The Ashley Maddison hack is unfortunate but have you heard how many more people have joined since? Clearly there is a lot of unhappiness out there. Lastly nobody joins those site wanting to cause trouble. Even if you accidentally discover someone from your office whos on there and active they would of course not want the cat out of the bag either. Its just how it works. In any case its never a blind date you always spend a bit of time getting to know the other person before you meet them,deadbedroom,cz2uwtw,1,t5_2wk69

6371295,0,t1_cz8mklv,I think the thing that a lot of these comments are saying is unfair to you and your wife. At the end of the day her actions are not helpful and are definitely passive aggressive but in almost two decades a break down in communication like this is usually the fault of both parties. You could disconnect from her go to the gym work on you but that wont help you connect with her. What is her side of the story? Why is she resentful? Shes done wrong Im sure but no one is perfect so Im guessing her coldness has a root. If you go to counselling to find it be prepared for it. We often dont notice our own behaviours. Try to see things empathetically and approach counselling together with humility and a willingness to change if you want to have another  years. Both people need to want it and pride and stubbornness need to be broken down to rebuild intimacy. If its something big on her end. If shes been feeling neglected or let down by you in some way it may take a while to get back the spark but it isnt impossible. If it is a purely bedroom problem there is a video from the school of life with a technique that may help.  A gentle and kind discussion is the best approach even if she is not kind at first. If you have grown apart and want to repair it you must bite the bullet and be the gracious bigger person. It can feel like you are being attacked when discussing sexual failings or asking to see a counsellortrying a therapy technique so its important to try to refrain from criticising and focussing more on telling her how you want to improve the happiness and satisfaction in both your lives on every level not just in the bedroom. That you want to foster a deeper intimacy and that you want her help. ,deadbedroom,czdugvm,1,t5_2wk69

6585760,0,t3_45n0dj,gt  Ive been tempted to have a physical affair though thats a slippery slope...You say that like its a bad thing.Seriously though you dont mention kids.  What exactly is keeping you in this relationship?  Why would it be bad to find a lover when this guy shows zero interest?  And if the lover turns out to be a better match and you leave for him why would that be bad?  Staying in this unfulfilling relationship is the bad thing.  You said it yourself your current guy doesnt even make a good friend.  ,deadbedroom,d00is6v,1,t5_2wk69
6638114,0,t3_45wwrx,Sometimes the squeaky wheels make it appear that way and there certainly are a few who rubber stamp it that way.  But its all about context.  Sometimes thats the right advice....sometimes its not.  Feel free to browse my post history.  ,deadbedroom,d05xrru,1,t5_2wk69

7008108,0,t3_4bmq0v,Wow. What a blow to your ego. I empathize with you.Since you and your wife are still young this might be a temporary phase. Pregnancy messes up womens hormones and turns us into someone else. Shes probably different now ever since the baby but she wont necessarily be always this unpleasant frigid person. Help her catch her sleep help with the housework and take her out on date nights. The purpose is to let her feel less like a caretaker and more like a wife and mother. Taking care of a baby  is a drudgery. I know bc I love my kids but hate the work. Youll have to learn to forgive her and back off. Perhaps woo her during this time without expecting anything back for a long while. Or at least let her sleep. Maybe a year? I hope not that long. Marriages has its ups and downs and I still have hope with yours bc youre both just inexperienced. Db is when you havent had any sex for a year and see none on the horizon. Yours might be temporary as it was caused by a new baby. Go to your local bookstore read a book or two on how to handle these tough times and just work on your marriage not just from your perspective but also from hers. Her cooch hurts the delivery was a nightmare she might not be getting enough sleep probably feels badly about her body just hanging there unlike the taunt and perky one she once had she probably feels more like a food source for your baby than the hot young thing she used to be and possibly has postpartum depression. If you chose well shell feel better in about six months to a year. If not then come back to db and well commiserate with you. For now I think theres a lot you can do suck it up and grab a shovel and help her with this baby thing. These are the days when shell look back and say to herself that hes meaning you a keeper. Im sorry about what she said. Its terrible and hurtful. Im not trying to trivialize it at all. You sound like a nice guy and your wife is lucky to have you on her side but she doesnt know it yet. BTW Im not usually this optimistic. But I definitely am with yours. Good luck. ,deadbedroom,d1apqg7,10,t5_2wk69

I havent told him because it would crush him if hes going to lose weight it needs to be from a positive commitment to lifestyle change not because he feels ugly and untouchable. Besides we had a two month span dubbed the Christmas Miracle lol where sex was frequent and great. Then finals happened and my drive evaporated again.

7529365,0,t3_4ig8yo,Something changed in mine. After  months my SO just stopped all affection. I mean all of it. No hugs no kisses he didnt even sit near me. I tried to still show him affection by kissing his head or trying to even simply touch him at times and he would pull away and huff at me. He was always down for sex though but I wasnt anymore as I need affection to get in the mood. I tried sitting down and communicating with him about it but he insisted it was stupid to act like love sick high schoolers.  After  and half years I broke down and broke it off.

7887979,0,t1_d42o3hq,She went off them because she didnt want to spend her whole life drugged up and her mind felt constantly fuzzydissociated.  Her environment has changed a LOT since meeting me so she wanted to try going off and seeing how her mind was naturally.However I dont think she is handling the down period very well and has relatively cut me out of the loop as to her inner workings compared to how open she was previously.  I dont know how much I can chalk up to a new job and  hour total commute time inducing a ton of stress or what.Im not unhappy enough to want to end this but I just cant tell for myself if shes checking herself out of the relationship or just overwhelmed lately.,deadbedroom,d42ok1w,1,t5_2wk69

8011473,0,t1_d4dm8ze,I understand what you are saying and I kind of felt that way in the beginning too because a lot of this overlaps with what is referred to as married red pill just removing the whole actual attempting to sleep with other people. From what I have seen you are essentially unlocking a mental state that already exists in your SO she has just suppressed it in favor of other things that currently have a higher priority. What you are doing is changing this priority dynamic and forcing her to reconsider you in that list of priorities. Right now you are just a cog in the marriage you are assumed to always be there she has already won you over and you arent going anywhere. Show her what she is missing and hopefully she will come around. ,deadbedroom,d4gkbj4,1,t5_2wk69
