Your an apprentice so they assume that you dont know anything so no need to play the role.My interviewer actually suggested having a back up job as it will probably be  months before you actually start working assuming youve passed through all  waves of the application process. Basic interview questions theyll ask if you have any construction related tickets passport convictions etc. It was simple dont over think it and good luck.

4426655,0,t3_3bof44,Hey dude were in the same local and year and Id PM this but others in our year may benefit from this knowledge.Weve got about a  month wait before our first placement because all the paperwork has to clear and they have to line up a decent first placement  journeymen large project for us to start on. Till then you should find some decent steady employment.Union dues are a bit more complicated. We have a base union due but also have to pay out per hour worked. For apprentices the dues are significantly higher hr apparently because of the training made available to us including a rd year turbine course expenses paid in Vegas plus others like heavy equipment operating rigging etc. So after taxes and dues your dad is right you will probably be making somewhere in the order of  per hour which is actually what I was led to believe from the getgo.I feel for your personal situation but I urge caution and not to jump the gun. Save your money get steady work going and save for a decent car first and foremost if you dont have one already. A car provides a ton of freedom and will let you stay OUT of the home for longer than if you didnt have one.Also even making crap wage in a temp job its possible to find a roommate and rent a  bedroom apartment on the fringes of Toronto for  a month. With food car expenses and other bills thatll run into  so keep that in mind.Like the union reps have been telling us from the beginning this is a difficult career to start. Its the experience and training that gets us working longer so keep your eye on that prize and grind it out as best you can.If you were paying attention to the HampS training rep though journeymen in our local easily top k per year without being overtime hogs. The hogs can pull in over k easy. So its worth sticking it out.,millwrights,csoo69s,2,t5_32q36

7878947,0,t1_d41f7te,I lied. Hes not a journeyman. he tested in as one. But since our union requires  years as an apprentice he makes  . I have  of the tools because Im a hobby mechanic he has x the tools because he was a mechanic for  years before. I also have a wife and kid so I want to pay off a house and  new to me vehicles and couple fourwheelers within  years. Im  one class from an AAS degree in IT. Decided I needed to take a break from being an EMT and make some good money. I have quite a bit more experience than most beginners into a wrenching world. Although I know about  rigging.I want to get in to the Nuclear side so I can make some good money and get experience so that I can go back and get my Mechanical Engineering degreeEmergency Management. Im not planning on retiring as a millwright. I plan on becoming a Police Officer of some sort. I just dont want to be the guy that has no life skills. I laid tile with my grandfather for  years when I was a teenager and spent  years wrenching on racecars. I still have a LOT to learn about many things. Hopefully thatll  get you a little background on me.Also I see more people from Canada on Reddit as a millwright than the states. Why is that? Im also not sure what all Im allowed to post Im sure Ill find more about that as I progress. on my phone so it may be a little rambley,millwrights,d41o0gl,1,t5_32q36
