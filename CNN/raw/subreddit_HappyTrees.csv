5370755,0,t1_cvy2rhy,You are correct that baby oil should not mix with your paints becaus  baby oil does not dry. I only clean small brushes while painting and I have at least two  inch brushes in use for foliage work. The  inch brushes do not get cleaned while painting. They retain too much oil. ,HappyTrees,cvy6ac2,1,t5_2sbc6
5522738,0,t1_cwc0pxw,Good first try!  I was too embarrassed to share mine.  It gets easier but these are my comments On liquid white it is to be used incredibly sparingly.  Once you apply it wipe it off with a paper towel.  This will help a LOT.  Using too much will prevent any of his techniques from working.  I make my own by mixing linseed oil and titanium white.  It should have the consistency of room temperature butter.  Not actually liquid.  Heads up. I use mostly  and  brushes on x canvas.  Firm hardware store brushes especially for trees.  Save the soft brushes for things like water and hairs and some air blending. do it.  Makes so many things easier. you are pushing too hard with your blade I can clearly see this in your mountains.  The only time you put actual pressure on it is when you put in super dark background colors.  The goal with that is to make your paint very flat.  When adding snow and shadows to a mountain bare touching the canvas.  When highlighting trees barely touch the canvas.  When highlighting rocks barely touch the canvas.  Dark colors go nuts.  Light colors?  Be delicate.   you are probably making your clouds with too much paint.  Also you have to fluff them in two steps diagonallyup and then horizontallyacross.  The streaks you get when brushing diagonally fluffing them up should mostly disappear when you go over them again horizontally.  Not completely but mostly.  Also try to be really gentle. ,HappyTrees,cwhkva8,2,t5_2sbc6

5598556,0,t1_cwq35ga,Hi Irish definitely a big improvement.  Here are a couple of tips if youre interested.   Keep working on the knife technique I found that if I got much less paint on the knife it would break up much better as I feathered it down the mountain. Also tap and blend up the paint at just the very bottom of the mountain to get that mist this will really make it fade to the background but still leave the mountain top sharp. When tapping in your bushes I really like to undermix my green yellow ocher and a bit of red when Im making the paint.  As you tap your brushes in youll get different highlights on different parts of you brush and all those colors will go right to the canvas. The water looks really good but make sure those water lines are just deadon horizontal.Good luck!,HappyTrees,cwr1yqd,1,t5_2sbc6

6132993,0,t3_3zgyp3,You can do it! Bob suggested dedicating a canvas to practicing mountains. You can keep scraping them off and reapplying. Its easier on a bigger canvas. When youre adding the highlights and shadows he doesnt always emphasize just how lightly you have to graze the canvas with the knife.You could also do a mountainless painting if you want to build confidence first.

8919135,0,t3_52f4r1,I painted  paintings before cleaning my paint thinner bucket. The problem that arose for me wasnt that the paint thinner wasnt good anymore but that there was a buildup of paint that almost reached up to the wire mesh in my bucket. As a result of this huge buildup I only had a very small amount of paint thinner which would get too dirty whilst I was painting and meant I couldnt get my brushes clean after I was finished painting. My brushes ended up getting crusty after use because when they dried there was still a small amount of paint on the bristles that would harden.My recommendation is to clean your bucket after twenty paintings. Pour out the paint thinner into another container then remove the buildup at the bottom of the bucket. You can put the old paint thinner back in the bucket when youre done.Hope this helps and happy painting!,HappyTrees,d7jy70z,1,t5_2sbc6

10410482,0,t3_5or57w,My tip would be to paint along with him.  Pull up a Youtube episode on your phone or tablet and paint at the same time.  Do exactly what he does.  Pause and rewind and watch again so you can better grasp.  By doing that it will take you a good  hours what he does in  minutes.  By trying to paint AFTER watching him you will easily forget how he does a lot of the things he does.  Doing that has helped me at least.
