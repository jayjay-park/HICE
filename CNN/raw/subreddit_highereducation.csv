206646,0,t3_1wgzeu,Ive had lots of luck with workshop attendance I think it has to do mostly with the culture of the institution but here are some thoughts.One thing Ive had luck with for low enrollment workshops is targeting specific groups. For example I have an introductory workshop for Blackboard which gets fairly good enrollment but sometimes Ill target a specific department and focus on the features most useful to them or show lots of examples relevant to their specific department. This works especially well when you can form a partnership with someone in that department in the planning phases who can help you pick which features to focus on and find recelvant exampls. This is especially efective if your partner is very tech savy or very gragarious person in the department or especially if you can get the department head on board and make it required training!Find out where the pain points are in instructor workflow. Telling them you want to train them on how to accept online submissions is much different than telling them you can eliminate the problem of students claming theyve submitted an assignment that the instructor doesnt have a record for. Maybe approch the facultys TA as they are more likley to be open to technology and would know the specific problems the instructor has.Another idea is to get faculty who are already using educational technology effectivly involved. Host a show and tell event where your group of faculty can show off what theyre doing with technology. This is another way to increase enrollment as the faculty you recrute will bring their friends.And of course the holy grail for increased enrolments Provide a lunch!,highereducation,cf1zb32,4,t5_2r04r

607339,0,t3_211e5s,In my classroom students are required to have their phones on vibrate and to take calls outside if they must take it. They are required to use their electronic devices in service to the topic under study. My classroom technique is to provide small lectures  min with questioning and discussions to accompany. The great revelation was when I was talking about a point in one of Platos dialogs and wondered aloud if the English translation of a Koine Greek word therein was the same as one found in other Koine to English texts with which we were familiar. A student got on his laptop and found the citations we needed and gave the answer win a minute. I saw that I had an important resource for our discussions.If a student is screwing around and off topic on their laptop theyll be asked to leave Ive only had to do that twice in the past  years.,highereducation,cg9b2oo,2,t5_2r04r
641643,0,t3_21hpmm,Compromising your goals can also be filling your stomach and paying your bills. We dont all get to be unicorn ranchers if you know what I mean. An additional degree is not the only thing that improves your chance of success eitheryou can go the Diploma of Ed direction and still pursue your goals. If I were you I would try to find someone who has knowledge of your field to critique your work. You need an honest outside opinion that might be able to see things that you are overlooking. Secondly do your best to make as many personal connections in the field that you can. People dont get hired from their degree and although a decent portfolio helps a personal recommendation goes much further. Whats preventing you from making and producing your own brief  minute documentary or a  minute documentary promo that you can use to pitch your idea? If you have something like that on hand and ready to share even on Youtube if you get into a conversation with someone about what you hope to do you can show them right away. Lastly if you have a good solid idea for a documentary that would benefit the public good pitch it on Kickstarter. You might get the backing you need to put together a great project that will give you some valuable portfolio fodder.,highereducation,cgd7ehh,1,t5_2r04r

3323254,0,t1_cp72eux,gt The problem is that the author wasnt a professor but an adjunct.Thats a spurious argument. Lets not forget that the word professor has its origins in instruction not in research and that the primary role of a professor is or ought to be that of an instructor and mentor. Ill allow a difference between graduate student instructors and instructors who hold terminal degrees of course. But from the undergraduate students perspective looking at the person at the head of the classroom theres little difference between the PhDholding faculty in adjunct positions and the PhDholding faculty in TTS positions and denying the former professionals the label of professor just serves to reinforce the rigidity of the twoclass system in academia. It moves the goalposts by saying that the only true professors are those lucky enough to have landed a TTS position and that their equallyqualified colleagues performing equal classroom work are inherently lesser and should not expect reasonable conditions or reasonable treatment for equal work.,highereducation,cp72usr,7,t5_2r04r

Ive thought about trying to convert them to twitterstyle posts in order to teach concision. Obligatory Im not a teacher but...In my last English Comp class I am a student we did twitter style posts to help develop thesis statements but not annotated bibs.  The younger students really picked up on that but the older student read me was a bit slower on the uptake. For annotated bibs we just did them.  I personally love them and use them all the time.  I have so many of them saved that I didnt use for the paper that I originally did it for that I have written two papers with no research because it was already done.  We did a lot of group workpeer editing and I found that a lot of my classmates think it is a waste of time until you show them how doing a good annotation basically writes your paper for you.  A few of my classmates have converted to the Church of the Annotated Bibliography but the others still struggle through them.I promise this isnt a ...as a parent... commentAs a parent of a high schooler see what I did there? I have talked to her and her friends about the writing process because when they come over I am always doing homework.  They are all in their schools advanced writingEnglish courses but none of them have even heard of this.  I watched one of her classmates struggle with a simple five paragraph admissions essay because he didnt know the writing process.  I worked with him for about a week and showed him my technique and he was already leaps ahead of where he was.I say that to say this.  A lot of high schoolers coming into college even the honors students have never been taught the process.  They seem to have a dislike for writing because they basically get a piece of paper shoved in front of them and told to outline draft revise and submit.  They get frustrated when they have to write because it has always been such a drag for them.I dont know if this is what you were looking for and I doubt it is but since nobody else replied as of yet I thought Id reply to keep your post from languishing in the nether.,highereducation,cthq06f,2,t5_2r04r

What skills do you want to high light? You can start big and fun and then go more serious and formal. For example maybe you can watch a funny video and try to annotate that. Then go to more serious academic examples. You could also trick them and have them practice the basic skills of the assignment informally and then make the big reveal What nerdy people call this is Whats going to help most of the time is to have them see the assignment in context of what they likeknow and then modeling it in something that they might not be familiar with and then repeated practice. ,highereducation,ctifb7r,1,t5_2r04r
