7135588,0,t3_4d8niu,My average grocery list Lentils Oatmeal I buy it plain in bulk none of those packets with tons of added sugar Frozen fruit for the oatmeal Peas Avocados pro tip avocados are a really easy snack. Just cut one in half add some salt and eat it out of the peel dont even need a platebowl.  Olive Oil Rice Red Bell Peppers Panko bread crumbs tea I love Celestial teas bengal spice tea it tastes delicious without any added sweetener I also consume a decent amount of mint tea Canned beans black beans garbanzo beans Vanilla almond milk sweet potatoes grapes I freeze them. Theyre perfect for when I want something kind of sweet  the fact that theyre frozen prevents me from eating too many of them too quickly. Typically I make some large meal involving some subsection of these ingredients  like a soup or a batch of veggie burgers. Then I just eat the same thing every night for a week.Pro tip just dont buy any snacks. Just skip that aisle. Youre an adult. You dont eat cookies and cake.  Dont look at it like a restriction frame it like a choice. For lunches with coworkers I guess it depends on where they want to go but for more casual places its probably fine to bring your own food then again Im not great at social intuitions. Its also substantially cheaper than going out. ,sugarprogram,d1p8klf,1,t5_3df3v

7275572,0,t3_4e2815,Ive been incorporating more berries than hand fruit lately generally lower in sugar than other fruits. Also when I do eat  a piece of fruit I try to cut it up and put spices on it so I eat it more slowly and it feels like it counts more than when I used to just passively and rapidly consume lots of hand fruit. For example cinnamon ginger or cayenne each make interesting pairings with apples or oranges.,sugarprogram,d256mft,2,t5_3df3v
