4935181,0,t3_3ihyuq,Few quick first look things  Just like with banning users please let us add a small note on the muting page. Although we can cover that up with toolbox usernotes it wouldnt really hurt to be able to use that option if someones modding via phone or work and to be able to have some documentation without relying on third party applications. Muting messages shouldnt show up in modmail just like bans that dont show unless the banned person replies it can get very spammy. Theres no value in it either as users are unable to reply to it edit a word. As mutes are stored elsewhere rsubredditaboutmuted theres no worries about it being quietly abused by fellow mods in most cases. and if they are silent mutes are probably the thing you should least worry about anyway.I definitely think that the limitation to mute for a maximum of  hours seems rather underwhelming once you give someone a permanent ban and he just results to spamming your modmail I think youd rather have him gone for good although he could definitely use alts its redundant to have to constantly refresh the ban not only for us because its more work and messages get into modmail at the moment but also for him as hell repeatedly receive messages every day. I dont think thats a good solution for either side. If you want to give us tools to help deal with modmail spammers amp unwanted users instead of relying on admins then you definitely need to go the whole way a temporary fix might discourage the majority of them but not all. ,ModSupport,cugmaiu,11,t5_39009
