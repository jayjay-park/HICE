5389494,0,t1_cw0exbz,In that link he left out part  from the original article  This is all unnecessary if you want to explain Islams rootsHolland and others make the arguments they do because they believe quite reasonably that nothing comes out of nowhere. People ideas and customs have genealogies. So could practices and beliefs promulgated in the Quran and the Prophets teachings be taken from elsewhere? Yes of course. The Quran announces that some aspects of Islam are repeats from earlier prophetic messages O you who believe fasting has been prescribed for you as it was for those who came before you . And there are well known reports that the Prophet Muhammad would follow the customs of the People of Book basically Jews unless commanded by God to do otherwise see the Shamail of alTirmidhi. So the origins of the five daily prayers as taught by Muhammad in his new religion may well lie in preexisting practices such as those of Zoroastrianism. But saying that Islam as a religion practiced and taught by Muhammad incorporated elements of earlier traditions is very different from saying that what Muslims believe to be a core teaching of their Prophet was actually adopted into Islam long after his death and this adoption then covered up.The refutation had an issue with the incorporation of the  prayers centuries after Mohammeds death rather than during his life. ,Zoroastrianism,cw0kgzu,1,t5_2t77s

If this guy left Islam to become Zoroastrian I have to respect him. He can probably never go back to Iran cuz of his choice. ,Zoroastrianism,d3b9dfq,1,t5_2t77s
