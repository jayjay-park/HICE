I notice you dont suggest that your sister was in fact a worse person than you because she lied better than you did.  You did the same things you just didnt hide it very well and therefore had to confess.  So the more significant indication is whether Adnan was deceitful in other areas with other people.

2184291,0,t1_clhf99z,as a general principle I  agree with you and I agree with basically everything that youve said but my problem is not that Adnan cant remember its that it doesnt fit that Jay suggests that Adnan wanted to get back to school to be seen.... Episode  only furthers this thought for me.and in terms of relevant time I was meaning that lets say he kills Hae at  and then manages to get Jay to pick him up and get him back to school at  ish... seeing adnan at school at  would be a relevant time for an alibi and would have raised several significant questions surrounding As involvement. Obviously it didnt happen but that was my point relevant time rather than exact. Plus remembering  weeks at least in the past for the witness is going to expand that time frame... lets say person A sees adnan in the library at  their explaination  weeks later to police could possibly have been sometime between  and  etc etc... that was what I wanted to say.edit but as episode  suggests Jays timeline for getting Adnan back to campus even for track at pm is damn near impossible,serialpodcast,clhh5un,3,t5_33vph

2252572,0,t1_clq4llm,I recalled the turn signal detail from the appellate briefing. But I just double checked  its Jays recollection of what Mr. Syed reported.  Youre right we dont know if the police corroborated that detail once they found the car.   Regarding Mr. Syeds denials it would not be the first time a guilty person denied involvement in a crime. I really dont put much stock in those statements.  I agree that Jays statements were all over the map. The most probable conclusion is he is lying in part and he was involved more than we know. This detail gets glossed over Domestic violence is a motive. According to Wikipedias domestic violence page in  in the United States  women and  men were killed by an intimate partner. People with no prior record go crazy sometimes. Its hard to understand from the outside but it happens. ,serialpodcast,clq51vn,3,t5_33vph
2252962,0,t3_2kzs43,This is a really interesting post.  I think maybe it can be refined a bit to zoom in on Syeds most crucial obstacles to proving his innocence.  Point  is absolutely true.  Hae would have to have been killed or abducted between .  are speculation. is so difficult for Syed.  Perhaps the conversation Nisha remembered where Jay was put on the line did not happen on the murder day.  Jay would have had to have pocket dialed her.  So odd it lasts over  minutes without any known voicemail.I think you can totally dismiss   and all the other testimony of the people hanging out with Syed that evening as to having any weight with respect to Syeds guilt.  It might be mildly corroborative of Jays over all narrative but it does not go to proving the immediate fact of Syeds guilty conscience or suspicious behavior.  Even if you throw all that testimony out there is more than enough to convict Syed with the cell pings Jays story the Nisha call and the notediary. and .  The poster has done a great job of laying out the facts as I understand them.  Yes there are inconsistencies in Jays retellings.  But they line up with the logs.  For this to have been orchestrated by the cops there would have to be a very sophisticated and intense level of coaching preparation and coordination between cops and Jay.  We would really need to ask whether the cops involved have a history of that level of naked and bold corruption.All of this goes to my belief that the jury verdict was reasonable in light of the facts and testimony they were presented.  The one thing Im curious about is in all of the interviews and press reports surrounding this podcast there remain a group of insiders still convinced that the Podcast will reveal Syeds innocence.  Not on a legal technicality but on the merits.  That means there is completely new evidence that somehow explains this mystery that we and the jury have not seen.  What could it possibly be that would explain away the cell tower ping the  minute Nisha call and the core arc of Jays story? ,serialpodcast,clq6see,6,t5_33vph
2254005,0,t1_cloiz0w,it still doesnt work. there was a murder. there is an investigation. in that light many details that arent ordinary suspicious become suspicious. its the murdernot our preconceived notion that Adnan is guiltythat puts them in that light. Somebody murdered her. the closer someone is to her and the more anomalies in that persons behavior around the time of the murder the more justified an investigation is in pursuing it. the fact is that he was in the habit of being in heavy contact with her up and until she was murdered at which point he stopped altogether even though the only fact hes been given is that she is missing which for most people who care about someone would inspire them to try to contact them more to see that they are OK not less amp not to stop altogether. it is a stunning detail as far as Im concerned and maybe not enough to convict on its own but a pretty damning piece of circumstantial evidence. as were several other items on this episode enough that I started to doubt the point of this podcast frankly. there was an investigation a trial there are strong circumstantial details Adnan is evasive exaggerated amp has explanations that dont make much sense. Even if Adnan didnt do it alone it seems pretty clear to me that there was a strong case against him and therefore the fact that there are doubts isnt all that fascinating to methere are almost always doubts but not reasonable doubts as that is defined by law. ,serialpodcast,clqbfgc,1,t5_33vph

Speaking from experience When youre poor and you have a car its a heap looking for an excuse to break down. A new car exists because somebody scraped and found the money in the couch cushions to do the down payment and is driving that car daily to the better jobs that keep the payments going so it doesnt just sit there. New cars have warranties so if it breaks the dealer comes and gets it you dont sit on it until you can afford the part.

2261805,0,t1_cloatwv,I think the answer to why involve Jay? is that Adnan and Jay were together on this from the beginning.  Jay and Adnan were obviously a lot closer than either admits.  Remember a friend saying that it was normal for Jay to pick up Adnan from school presumably in Adnans car?  Both Jay and Adnan try very hard to downplay their relationship but all the other evidence points to the idea that they were pretty close friends hanging out and getting high together a lot.  If you accept Jays story that Adnan did the whole thing and involved Jay only as an afterthought then sure his involvement doesnt really make sense.  But if you start with the idea of a couple of high school kids deciding together to commit a horrible crime then the question of why one involved the other doesnt really come up.,serialpodcast,clra2ir,8,t5_33vph

2265511,0,t1_clr244i,The Nisha Call Serial Episode  main points. The case for Adnans innocence  . Adnan is practically comatose less than  hour after leaving Track practice from what Kathy describes about their visit. Not a stretch to think Jay slipped Adnan a Roofie to make him putty in Jays hands. Jay is a drug dealer. Explains Adnans I dont remember answers to many vital questions about that afternoon.. Jays motive for killing Hae Jealousy. Of Adnan himself. Adnan is going places as Rabia say in ep. . And Jay is going nowhere except a porn video store. He kills Hae precisely because Adnan does care about her. Not necessarily to frame him at first see . . Jay initially uses Adnan as his alibi. Explains Jays random showing up with Adnan to Jenns best friend Kathys house  only an acquaintance. And someone Adnan does not even know. This must have seemed like a good idea because Kathy is neutral  but he knows her just well enough to show up unannounced. . The Nisha Call pings off a cell tower near Best Buy at . More than an hour after Adnan supposedly makes the  call to Jay to pick him up there. This crucial call at  is the one call that so far as we know has not been received to Adnans phone.. In s technology Nisha could likely have Voicemail on her phone but was unaware of it   being an automatic feature added to ones plan. So possibly a pocket dial.. The call right before The Nisha Call at  is to Jenn at . Jay telling her to meet him at Best Buy while hes en route?? Perhaps unknowingly she gets there only to discover Jay has Haes body in a trunk. So flipped out by what Jay describes as Haes blue lips and pretzel form Jenn in a panic helps Jay get rid of Haes car get a shovel from his house then go to Leakin Park. Jenn drops Jay off to dig the grave and bury Hae. Remember in Jays first story  which can be mined for bits of truth  he drops Adnan off to bury the body alone and then comes back later Jay and Jenn have until Jay picks up Adnan at  to take care of business. . Adnan never pages Hae after she goes missing. When police call him they dont tell Adnan that Hae never picked her cousin up from school. Only asking if hes seen her. Thats a big difference. And Jay has just slipped him a daterape drug. Hae herself has made it crystal clear that Adnan should move on in the letter thats read in court. So by January th hes done just that.. Hae is going to be in so much trouble with her mom when she gets home is the most genuine thing any innocent yo teenager would say. Even  years later it rings true. . Hae is going to be in so much trouble with her mom when she gets home. Shows that Adnan expects her to return probably shortly. So why start frantically paging her? They arent even going out anymore. And by the time it appears serious many people have already paged Hae. Is Adnan supposed to think hes so special  even though Hae has blown him off  that hes the one person she will feel impelled to call back? And besides it seems like Jay could have used up all of Adnans cellphone minutes on January th with number of personal calls hes made from Adnans cellphone. All except one Nisha which makes that call very out of place and suspect. . Adnan freaks out in Kathys words because he must go to the Mosque to deliver food to his devoutly Muslim father. Around the same time the police call him. And Adnan hes wasted.. Why would Adnan call Hae to give her his cellphone number the night before he calculatedly planned to kill her? Nisha is the first person he calls on the new cellphone two days before giving the number to Hae. Adnan has moved on.. Jay may have killed Hae on impulse having the perfect opportunity with the unexpected use of Adnans car and cell phone  possibly using the car with its hood up on the side of the road as a ruse to get Hae to pull over. Or does Hae get a page from Adnans phone in the right timeframe?. Jenn is the third person the real accomplice after the fact and who Jay is protecting or containing from police. The most number of calls  on Adnans cellphone that day were to Jenn. Thats why police contact her first. Jenn leads police to Jay in fact. Jay says to her Send them my way. All according to Jenns police interview. Why would someone like Jay involved in a murder welcome police scrutiny? Because he feels he can contain the situation with police better than Jenn who having been an accomplice to murder is perhaps more likely to crack giving him up. Just as Jay turns around and does to Adnan. . Jenn brings a lawyer to her second interview with police. Why didnt Jenn call police right away to tell what she knew about Haes disappearance? Right...she is good friends with Jay see . Her storytimeline does not match Jays. If both are telling the truth this would be inconceivable. Instead Jenn parses out just enough information to get police off her back but not implicate Jay too much.. The Police ask Jay Did you do it? Did you kill Hae Lee? He says no. Police pretty much go Oh okay. With no further adieu. Why dont police begin investigating Jay at this point? Because they feel theyve got their man Adnan. For no other reason than Jay  a confessed drug dealer and inveterate liar  tells them so. And Adnan is the exboyfriend Police have a onetrack mind about that. And there was that anonymous call saying to look at the exboyfriend. It never occurs to experienced investigators that the anon call could have come from the killer himself  meaning hes still out there. . Early on Adnan must have said I didnt do it until blue in the face but somehow this does not work as well for Adnan as it does for Jay. Fifteen years on Adnan realizes he needs to take another tack by pointing to lack of evidence motive or opportunity.. Police never bring in their prime suspect Adnan for questioning. Police have been building a case against Adnan for at least a month by time hes arrested. If they had Adnan would have had the chance to martial evidence of his innocence and recall the day before completely fading from memory see . This is the advantage police dont want Adnan to have. The investigation is not open it is closed. Jay and the Police just need to work out how they can shoehorn Adnan into the scenario. . Awkward silences on the telephone with Sarah Koenig. Adnan has been in this living nightmare for  years. And yet again here is another person making him defend himself. When you are innocent it is hard to answer questions from the standpoint of defending yourself...without sounding guilty. Try it.. The police are who ultimately frame Adnan. Jay is just happy to oblige. The Police work meticulously with Jay to iron out his story changing it as many times as necessary in order to come to a mutually satisfying narrative in which they can match cellphone calls and tower pings. But the calls and pings and storyline presented at trial only matchup after  p.m. . Jay uses elements of truth to make his story somewhat believable. Inserting himself in Jenns true role as the accomplice after the fact. And substituting Adnan for himself in the role of murderer. Enough detail is given by Jay to make him seem credible. . Jay can tell Police where Haes car is ditched. This alone is enough to consider him as prime suspect. Meriting some investigation to rule him out as the killer. Especially the way he lies.. Crime  might speculate that the anonymous caller is the real killer wanting to deflect police attention. Haes body has just been found. Time to go on the offensive. . Anon caller via someone put up to it is clueless that the exboyfriends cell records will come so prominently into play as to lead police directly to Jenn his childhood friend and accomplice.. Jenn tells police I dont know. Adnan must have paid Jay a lot of money. Jenn herself tells cops that Adnan and Jay are not close hence the money remark.  . The timeline now has Hae leaving the school concession stand at . Hae is not in as big a hurry as Sarah Koenig is to make the police timeline. There are a thousand kids in the hallway friends to talk with. At  Adnan is supposed to be calling Jay to pick him up at Best Buy. That is only  minutes not . Sarah barely did it in . . We hear Asia with our own ears unequivocally say she talked not saw talked to Adnan in the library that day. So The Nisha Call Paging Freak Outs Motive Jay amp Adnans closeness etc. etc. are pure conjecture colored by personal beliefs. Adnan couldnt have murdered Hae until after Track Practice and shes missing by then. Thats all anyone needs to know. ,serialpodcast,clrqjfn,5,t5_33vph

2268056,0,t1_cls1hds,Sure. Some people think it is too obvious though and I think Sarah was one of those people too and thats what might be throwing her off. Like why would he place this blatantly incriminating statement on this note then keep it but the statement isnt even a fully thought out sentence that a person would normally write such as Im going to kill Hae or her. Some people have mentioned its possible that he could have written in during class then class ended and he just never finished the sentence and it was supposed to say something like Im going to kill myself if this lecture doesnt end or whatever which I think would just be such a sheer strike of bad luck considering he became a prime suspect in the murder of the notes originator that it seems highly unlikely but Im just trying to think why Sarah would also dismiss this. She could be on the same line of thinking as some of the other posters.

2274705,0,t3_2l9usx,The short answer It depends.  I was the foreman on a murder trial in Philadelphia.  We got our case on a Thursday at about  pm deliberated about  hours then asked to go home for the night.  We came back the next day and were deadlocked for a while then we were told that IF we couldnt agree the judge could hold us for a LONG time and force us to deliberate.  Since it was summer some of us had vacation plans waiting and we were tired we read our verdict at about  pm Friday.  If it had been a Tuesday I guarantee you we would have gone for DAYS.  Did we FORCE the holdouts to swing our way to go home?  No.  They were all polled and we all delivered the same verdict.  However as the foreman I did ask the judge to reconvene court and reread the definition of reasonable doubt.  You may think you know it when you see it but I promise you when youre in the jury room you will behave differently than you would in the outside world.  I think that in Syeds case the DA just presented a better case.  Was that because of an incompetent attorney?  Possibly.  Was there reasonable doubt  in my opinion?  Based on what Ive seen yes.  But keep in mind  a LOT of what is presented in Serial was never presented in court.  And even if the jurors heard things like the witness mentioning the video store  signalling that perhaps she was confused on the timetable  they may have lacked the context of that timetable.  So based on the evidence the jury saw and ignoring everything else they may have heard outside the courtroom theres a good chance that to the jury this appeared like an openandshut case where he just didnt have a defense.,serialpodcast,clsvf85,1,t5_33vph
2276841,0,t3_2la4qj,Also if Jay told Jenn about the murder when she picked him up from Westview parking lot which they both admit to pretty sure that was before they go back to Kathys house together.

2277891,0,t1_clt96h5,I agree. Its not original to look at a case with not the strongest evidence and analyze whether a wrongful conviction occurred. What is unique about Serial is the format. Usually this type of story is either featured on TV show like  Hours or Dateline where one case is dealt with in an hour or in a feature length documentary. That type of treatment does not go into the same depth that a show like Serial can because of the time constraints. The closest comparison I can think of to Serial is the trilogy of Paradise Lost documentaries that followed one case over many years.,serialpodcast,clt9l1v,1,t5_33vph
2278109,0,t3_2lb10m,Can we please stop jumping to conclusions left and right about the nature of probably insignificant calls of high schoolers?

Hell Ive even seen a picture recently on rfunny of a text message wall of like  Hey messages until the girl answered she was in the shower or something and we all just laugh at it because lol sometimes people do weird things.The truth is we really dont understand the nature of their relationship THAT well.  Ive had relationships with girls back in high school and college that were oh we dated for a while but now were just friends and thats cool.  Some people stay decent friends with their exs some dont some people take a little while to get over the relationship some dont.  Sometimes people have a hard time getting over a relationship but end up being friends!  The spectrum is incredibly varied.

I dont think she was fabricating a story but likely confusing one storm for another that occurred several days later. This might also explain why later on she has been inconsistent about affirming her original story. There does seem to be a vibe of fangirl excitement in the original letters  she seemed excited at the prospect of being swept up in the drama as a potential alibi witness.

It was also the subject of one of the all time greatest longform pieces in the New Yorker. If you guys want to take a break from obsessing about this case for a few hours you should check this out.It might even make you look at this case from a different perspective.

She said he said  Allah knows Im innocent rather than the the Baltimore Sun story that has him being quoted as saying the Lord knows I didnt kill her.  So my experience with Moslems in laws would be that they would say Allah and not the Lord. Wonder why the Sun would report this way?

Sure they are out to do good and solve mysteries and profile criminals but theyre also pretty clearly meant as a form of entertainment that makes money for their respective channels. And I realize theres real people involved and its very unfortunate. But I dont think its wrong or disrespectful to talk about Serial in terms of its charactersarcstructure. Just like any true crime show or nonfiction work. Nonfiction works like In Cold Blood Into the Wild even biographical works like I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings wouldnt be as compelling if they were just a serious list of facts.

When it IS brought up in the episode that was explicitly about The Case Against Adnan Syed it is again brushed aside.Lets face it while I dont think theres bad faith on SKs part the fact of the matter remains is that there is ONE consistent contemporary voice and that is the one of Adnan and his supporters. Thats fine. The problem I do have is that they all tend to overlook the fact that there is a dead young lady and there is hardly a mention of her.To bring Twin Peaks back into the whole deal that show never failed to show the very real trauma and sorrow that a death in a community can bring.

2339270,0,t1_cm0tvwj,This line of thinking only makes sense if you believe Adnan is guilty. If he wasnt guilty why would he have any reason to think he was a suspect? What would he even think he was suspected of doing and why would he care to go consider the very real possibility that he would be a suspect in some potential case later on? If I didnt do anything I wouldnt care to get my story straight or make sure I remembered by alibi since I would have very little reason so suspect that I would be in trouble. I would probably just assume that if the police ended up wanting to talk to me I would tell them what I know and I would be fine because I know I didnt do anything. Obviously this would all be different if Adnan is guilty. But if that were the case Adnan would certainly remember where he was the day he murdered Hae so the point would be moot.  ,serialpodcast,cm0uhdj,8,t5_33vph
2339311,0,t3_2m3bwn,I went to an innercity magnet school like Hae and Adnan. I mean it wasnt super innercity but it was definitely import rich white kids to the ghetto in order to get money into that side of town.In my school there were two different groups. The black kids in the standard classes and literally everybody else in the APHonorsRunning Start programs. So yeah a shitton of us white kids and some Asian sprinkles.We all went to school in the ghetto. We all shopped at the ghetto Walmart across the street after school. We were part of a very segregated school but somehow managed to make it work.I see what youre getting atAdnan and Hae are both white kids in the magnet school hierarchy. It is a distinction you feel implicitly and fundamentally if youve ever been in that sort of dynamic. You sit on the fenceyoure part of the school group as a whole but you also dont belong. I can see how Adnan a member of the schools privileged white group pointing out that Hae is now dating a white guy totally out of this sphere of reference caught your attention.  And the fact that he goes to two different people and says that Don is white is striking. Suddenly theres a third layer to this social structurethe predominantly black school the magnet minority and true white Don. I rarely describe people by race because I grew up in magnet schools. It made me ultrasensitive. You could put a black woman in front of me and the first thing Ill reference when I describe her are her clothes and her height.I think that this lends some credence to...perhaps not a jilted lover argument but...perhaps to an argument that Adnan was more preoccupied with the racial structure of his community than weve so far seen in Serial. ,serialpodcast,cm0unxt,2,t5_33vph

2345041,0,t1_cm1gfwd,Not only that but Saads relaying this thirdhand at best. He admits he only ever met Hae in passing he did not go to the same school as the rest of them etc. So his basis for this claim about Jay cheating on StephanieHae knowing is from what he would have heard from Adnan likely.Plus if as he claims Hae did not like Jay and was one of Stephanies best friends and this rumor was flying around enough that Hae knew about it seems a lot more likely Stephanie already had heard it if it actually was a rumor andor that Hae would just tell her directly.ETA Even if you accept all of this to be true Jay was cheating on Stephanie with Jen Hae heard about it but Stephanie was somehow oblivious and Hae chose to confront Jay this was in a presocial media preeveryonehasacellphone era. The likelihood of her having any tangible proof that would actually threaten Jay to the point where he would attack her is very slim and would probably have been discovered in the wake of her death when the cops searched through her belongings. Not to mention there is no mention of Jay at all in her diary which she seemed to like to relay the dramas of the day in.,serialpodcast,cm1k4d8,8,t5_33vph

Sometimes I feel like My Cousin Vinny is more true to life. Although when you look at other violent murders more recently its also terrifying that someone can so easily be acquitted.I went back and listened to episode  today and I was thinking about my teenage self in comparison to Adnan. I wouldnt have thought it could have been potentially affected my character in this way at the time but I had a TON of secrets from my parents. Even more recently I smoked cigarettes regularly from age  and it was some serious Margot Tennenbaum shit. I never wouldve thought lying about things like that would affect what people think of my character. It was more like in my mind we all wear masks and show different ones to different people to benefit ourselves. I wanted to seem professional at work a good kid for my family nonsmoker mask but yet enjoyed smoking when driving or drinking with friends smoker mask.

If I were to say Jay was actually elsewhere within a radius around the tower and we dont know what that radius is you couldnt deny it. Also none of us have actually seen transcripts or heard the chronological order of the evidence.

It tightens the timeline to only an hour.  Not the best obviously you would want someone to testify to your whereabouts for the missing hour.  To craft that kind of alibi you would need someone to lie for you which brings the risk of a third person.Its not rock solid but it sure is better than nothing.  Adnan later abandons this alibi.

Not a new theory by any stretch of the imagination but I think they did it together and Jay just changed the story to extract himself later and pin it on Adnan.Its honestly a woefully unbelievable theory and likely the result of me watching too much TV and thinking that there are far more psychopaths in real life than there actually are.From the beginning the entire ohhh I told him to take my car and phone to buy his girlfriend a gift made no sense to me.  So what I think is happening is they did the murder together agreed on their alibis and stories and all that jazz and then Jay just flipped changed bits of the story to remove himself from the actual murder aspect pin it all on Adnan and all on the sword of helping after the fact.Jay cant change his story because it would implicate him further.

2392052,0,t3_2m1och,My first true love my first serious boyfriend was someone who I cared about a lot. We broke up and got back together a number of times. This was mostly due to pressure from the adults in our lives. I wasnt allowed to date. His parents didnt approve.  We were advised by other adult mentors that we shouldnt be so serious so soon. So wed break up. Then hed go out with someone else briefly and break up with me. Soon Id have another girl come crying to me that he broke up with her because she wasnt like me and wed ended up getting back together mostly secretly. Well a secret from parents and adults of course all our friends knew. It wasnt a sexual relationship we never moved beyond uhhh Ill call it second base but we adored each other and spent lots of time dreaming of what it would be like if we could grow up and get married and have our own house. We danced and he sang songs to me we smoked a lot of weed.Then he was killed by a drunk driver when riding his motorcycle home from work one night. I was devastated. The thing is we were broken up at the time and both talking to other people. I was still in love and hoping to get back together again. When he died though I didnt really get to be the one who was comforted. I was the ex. The new girl was the one who got all the support the new girl was the one who got all the sympathy. The new girl was approved of by the parents and we were getting older by then. I was just some girl he used to go out with.Since I wasnt supposed to have really been dating to begin with I couldnt really talk about it to my parents. His death was mentioned and even though we didnt have a sanctioned bringhimhomerelationship they were fully aware of my feelings for him. However once it was mentioned as news there was never any futher discussion or support for my feelings.I could really only talk about it at all with my to this day BFF and she only wanted to hear my whining to a limit so this is something I really had to grieve over alone.We didnt get to get married. I married someone else not too long afterward at a somewhat young age who was parent approved. And I was in love with him he was my next true love.  He knew about Danny but its not like I could sit around and cry with him about it all day.Over  years later I still grieve mostly alone. At almost  I cray at random times when I hear one of our songs. Sometimes if Im alone and feeling really sad Ill just play those old songs and cry into a pillow like a teenage girl. Sometimes I still dream of him and it feels so real....But all these years later Ive only even said his name out loud to a few people and then mostly in passing. In over  years I have never displayed a single bit of emotion or sadness about him in front of another person except my husband. Who holds me and soothes me because he also lost his first love but thats another story.,serialpodcast,cm7d5b0,1,t5_33vph

2399006,0,t3_2mvvba,Very good post. Ill take it a step farther however. SK has gone over the edge with this episode. She is no longer a journalist at all or even a story teller. She has thrown in with being an advocate and I think this makes the whole podcast suspect. She ties these new memories together with Asia McClains supposed alibi to make her initial point. Asias story is the biggest crock of all. Anyone who says theyre willing to give someone an alibi for a  hour window is hardly credible in any way shape or form and the judge rightfully ruled that the lawyer most likely didnt use her for that reason. Her proposal for the alibi even included times that contradicted Adnans own statements for cryin out loud. How SK can go back to that is just so bogus. The biggest news of the week however was that someone from Haes family was here on the Reddit boards and SK glossed over the fact. She did finally admit that the young man here on Reddit was from Haes family. That should have been the opening of this program. It makes the whole affair a little creepy in my estimation and since this whole exercise has been about how SK tells the story I would have loved to know how she felt about that post. Shes too tied up with Adnan however. Shes no longer a reliable narrator in my humble opinion. Oh and they want our money.Yuck!,serialpodcast,cm88459,3,t5_33vph

Hes had  years to make his story his beliefs his feelings his thoughts his behavior everything exactly what you would expect from an innocent man.  Even if he is innocent Im sure hes gone over all the possible ways to sound more innocent.  Dont get me wrong I think they are excellent parts of the narrative here and I think what he has to say is fascinating.

2402913,0,t1_cm89ppc,Justice is also a huge theme in Islam. The jurisprudence behind it is really complex... its not something youd get from a quick skim of the Quran there are seven layers of sources to go through beginning with the Quran and ending in cultural practice in order to establish whats permissible and forbidden and how to apply that to individual circumstances. No one person knows all this theres too much. But Islamic scholars can and do spend a lifetime studying it. What Im getting at here is that if you feel like youve been willynilly convicted of something on the basis of lies corruption or just plain laziness on the part of cops or bored jurors there would definitely be an attraction to a philosophy that goes deep into ethics.   Justice in this case also includes socioeconomics. Wealth inequity is assumed but the rich have many responsibilities towards the poor and are not supposed to hoard their wealth when they could be spreading it throughout the community either by employing people or through pure charity. If you come from a community thats been systematically oppressed over generations the appeal there is straightforward.Theres a ton of this in Islam. ,serialpodcast,cm8piz9,3,t5_33vph

As far as establishing where he was with credit cards and such none of that is terribly relevant if Jay has Adnans phone and car and Adnan is actually at track practice. As far as verifying he was there with video no hs track team in America in  video taped their practices i doubt any do today either. As far as the coach goes well the coach actually says he was probably there but I cant affirmatively prove that to you because I dont take attendance. And we heard from other track team members who said they remembered Adnan being there that day. Its not a slam dunk thing either way but its not all that hard to see how Jay could be pretty confident that Adnan would have no alibi or a weak alibi for the time in question. ,serialpodcast,cm8r50n,3,t5_33vph

He was alone in a room with a bunch of cops. He was black. Frankly the fact that Adnan said he was going to murder Hae in advance to Jay and then Jay helped bury the body is enough for a first degree murder conviction for Jay.So here he is... ... in a room with cops for hours on end. Hes facing all kinds of charges and as near as he can tell twisting one little detail one way or the other can be the difference between life in prison and walking away. But the cops promised immunity! one might say. What do you think a cops promise of immunity means to a  year old black man living in Baltimore in ?He had every reason in the world to lie. He just couldnt keep his story straight as One he was stoned all the time. Two it was a traumatic event. Three he was culpable for murder. Four he was terrified of the police.

He would have to create lies very well  to be able to do this with the frequency he did. overall this is not saying that anyone with strict parents will turn out to be a murderer Im just saying it seems relatively unexplored by SK and it definitely fits the bill for an environment in which a manipulative person could emerge from.

2411822,0,t1_cm9rshe,I made up my mind pretty early but the most telling part in the podcast is at minute  in episode .  She asks a question and there is a long silence.  Basically the question she is asking you seem like a great guy how could you kill somebody? is the same type of thing somebody who wants to believe in somebody simply because they want to or because of charisma in the extreme case a victim of abuse but pretty much anybody who has some reason to care for some one and Adnan had no answer.  It is a very important pause where he cannot answer the question.  That is because the only answer to the question is what he says she doesnt know him.  And what she doesnt know is hes a murderer.  Basically he has to remain logical because that is the main thing that holds his whole false and pathological story together.  This is true with any liar there is always SOME logic.  This part of the podcast is very poorly done IMO because she then skips right to a phone call the next day to allow him to continue to answer the question.  He has had  hours to tweak his answer.  She just wants to believe his story.  Remember he has no story. ,serialpodcast,cm9t6h1,1,t5_33vph
2412003,0,t3_2n2eua,I would say motive almost  of the time motive. Especially when dealing with young people. I was a middle school and high school teacher for  years and many of the greatest kids ones I would never expect to do something bad or out of character ended up doing really stupid things. They didnt steal or lie or fight because they suddenly became bad people. They did it because there was a very compelling reason to money or status or peer pressure or ANYTHING they really cared about at that moment.I think wed like to think character is the indicator because that feels safer more comforting. I never wanted to believe my favorite kids could do the terrible things they did. Every time I heard about an incident my stomach turned and my heart sank. I would think why? Thats insane. Thats so dumb! But inevitably I would have to accept that yes they were capable no matter how lovely and wonderful they were because they had found a compelling reason to do a stupid thing in a given moment.I think the biggest problem with this case is we dont have a clear motive. We may never find one. So it is nearly impossible to say with certainty it had to be THAT guy and we are left following our hearts and saying who we WANT it to be or following facts and patterns well normally its the boyfriend so it HAS to be Adnan or well it could only be someone with a history of crimeviolence so it HAS to be Jay and saying who we think it SHOULD be.

2412005,0,t1_cm9tryw,What youre saying is true.  The important thing that I am trying to get at is not this tangential information of course it is a problem for everyone involved if some journalist dredges something up for no reason besides making a nice podcast but Adnans pathology basically his motive and his whole story that he has been telling since before the murder.  Of course it is not logical to kill some one but the story Adnan makes up and the reason that he gives himself for doing are all logical otherwise he would never present as such a puttogether person.  IMO this whole murder is super highschool.,serialpodcast,cm9tzr1,2,t5_33vph

The Hae note in question   Is this a note that Hae wrote to Adnan or one Adnan wrote to Hae?  If Adnan wrote it to Hae did he get the note to her back at some point and wrote the kill thing on it?oops couple more questions. Certainly possible I misheardmisinterpreted but didnt one of Haes friends say that this was something they were scribbling notes to each other in class?  Aisha possibly? Was it said that this note passing took place in their nd period class the one they had together?  If so is that a possibility that Adnan managed to somehow intercept it?  Id thought that Aisha? had said it was a piece of paper that had some writing on the front side and so they were scribbling notes on the other side of the paper. If indeed this was a note from Adnan to Hae or Hae to Adnan bow in either scenario did he end up having it and for the girls to write notes on the back of it?  Again sorry if covered.  And yeah that was more than a couple questions     If this has been discussed and someone can find the thread here Id be interested to read it out of curiosity to clear it up in my head.,serialpodcast,cma0hf8,2,t5_33vph

2416046,0,t3_2n4f0i,I can understand your sentiment here. I was a juror in a domestic violence case once and at the end of it I was pretty darned sure that the guy hit is girlfriend. Unfortunately his girlfriend testified that he did nothing at all and the evidence was...somewhere between weak and nonexistent. We ended up finding the guy not guilty even though all of us thought that he did it. Assuming we were right the guy was guilty. Just not beyond a reasonable doubt so we could not find him guilty in court. I didnt leave feeling great about the fact that a guy who Im pretty sure smacked his girlfriend had just gone free. But at the same time if we go with our gut feel as a jury were going to be wrong sometimes. Maybe not most of the time or even very much at all. Maybe well be right  of the time. But the idea of one innocent person going to prison is so much worse than the idea of  or  or even  guilty people walking free.

If you listen to the interview with Jay in episode one they are definitely guiding his story. Again there are a lot of theories that neither Jay nor Adnan were involved and the detectives just planted the entire story in order to get a conviction. Supposedly Jay had a rap sheet they could hang over his head. So then it would make sense that they are trying to get others to implicate Adnan too. EDIT This rush to get a conviction would also explain why no one really cared to check out the phone booth and why the timeline was so off.

Their brains are still developing they were chill with weed...not embittered old men with a grudge or doing it for a motive like insurance money or revenge... I DO think it was a crime of passion...just NOT the one the police suspected. I think it was Jays crime of passionate and sudden anger against Hae that he was not good enough for Stephanie.And WHY was Jay stepping out ugh term on Stephanie?

2421557,0,t3_2n6i2g,Generally owing to my interest in the investigatory aspect of the casepodcast two books that have really informed my views are Homicide by David Simon and My Dark Places by James Ellroy.The first book follows a cast of detectives from the Baltimore Homicide Division and the daily rigor of bringing murder cases to a jury. It has a special relation to the podcast because of the setting and the paperclip proximity that the book offers us to cases where physical evidence is scant andor an accomplice is the key to building the case. Quote for exampleBut a dump job in Leakin Park or in an alley in a vacant house or a car trunk offers nothing. It stands mute to the relationship between the killer the victim and the scene itself. By definition a dump job strips the murder of any meaningful chronology andwith the exception of whatever items are abandoned with the bodyof physical evidence.The second work by Ellroy is primarily about his search involving the enlistment of a retired LAPD homicide detective for the killer of his mother. However because it is as Roberto Bolano called it one of  the best things written in the literature of any language in the last thirty years it stands as a psychologically unfathomable paean to the memory of murder victims and the wake of their death.,serialpodcast,cmb0h6o,4,t5_33vph

2422506,0,t1_cmazxka,Its fine to call a lawyer but why not call for a lawyer and then work towards clearing yourself?  Instead thats the last we heard from Adnan.  He never testified.  He never said Hey Mom go talk to the clerk at the gas station because I bought a slushie that day.  Or his best friend isnt screaming so people would listen to him saying where they both were at that time.  Nothing has been offered.  Things can be offered after lawyering up.  We can talk race because its always an issue but I dont understand why Adnan allowed for not one but two trials.   DAs win  of their cases.  Thats not a secret.  To go to trial is grasping at straws because DAs dont try innocent people.  Theres plenty of guilty people to use their budgets for and the DA has no reason to risk acquittal. They can offer plea deals lesser charges smaller amounts of time when they have a weak case.  So very often theres a guilty person sitting at the defense table and when someone is innocent theyll take that witness stand and let the truth be known and live with those consequences and that such a strong indicator of guilt or innocence that we bar juries from evaluating that choice.   However were post trial.  Hes in prison and didnt take the stand.  Of course he would now because he knows the outcome if he doesnt take the stand but it does say something after the trial when someone isnt willing to be cross examined in open court AFTER getting their story told by their lawyers and if a person is truly innocent theyd welcome that chance not hide from it. I sure hope the justice system has this case right because hes so young or was at the time and man Im surprised at how indifferent his classmates were and are.  Its like it was somewhat of a big deal something to talk about at the time and then when the trial was over it was like oh well got stuff to do cant be worried about that.

Poor you  and poor them too to some extent.I think your second half is really interesting. I never asked my Uncle bc thats not something I would expect him to actually respond to much like he didnt respond to my cousin asking what he did to land him there but I feel like a lot of it is that its just part of who he is. One thing he has always remained staunch on was that he never did drugs himself. My dad was an addict though clean for over  years now and my dad would tell me that my uncle made sure to keep my dad as far away as possible did not allow him any drugs didnt even trust him near any of his personal shit. My dad always said he believed it was just the idea of power and control and respect that drew my uncle in  he was only  when he was arrested and had been part of the Organization as they were called for years at that point and he moved up quickly through the ranks. In one of the court filings for one of his many appeals its noted how a witness testified that they asked him at one point why he didnt hire people to kill for him and my uncles response was that hes the kind of man that likes to handle it himself. So for me it always just seemed kind of like a duh that he would get into prison and start trying to climb to the top and be the big man on campus there too. It helps as well that he had his family sending him money and contraband and whatnot. A lot of his assets were seized in his arrest he made a few appeals trying to get his Cadillacs to be returned to my grandmother but he still had money ferreted away money that they send him and have used to buy property in his name since his incarceration. Its like power is his way of getting high I guess. He lives for that thrill and doesnt really stop to consider how it affects anyone else. My Grandma is old so traveling to see him is hard for her and he got himself booted out of NY prisons years and years ago so she has to make the trip to Florida when her health permits.

Because those were the only ones that matched jays story which is... just... wow A lot of links were posted about how cell towers work the conclusion is that cell towers are not designed to locate phones at a precise location.

2438334,0,t1_cmd1scv,My point was made in the post that started this thread.There were not two possible killers.  If Hae Jay and Adnan were locked in a room together and only Jay and Adnan walked out there would be only two possible killers.In this case the set of possible killers includes any life form capable of strangling a human within reasonable travel distance of Woodlawn high school after  on January  .The set of possible killers could include an orangutan brought back to Baltimore from Sumatra by a one legged sailor.The problem is that at least one juror and you counsellor seem to have decided prime face that either Jay or Adnan committed the crime and it was simply a question of which one.At that point all the state really needed to do was make it seem more likely that Adnan killed her than Jay.That is not proving their case beyond a reasonable doubt that is hosting a popularity contest.,serialpodcast,cmd30ob,0,t5_33vph
2438543,0,t1_cmd2i4v,Rightexactly! Adnan isnt Haes parent or child.  If he were it would be unacceptable for him not to hound Haes voicemail.  If she had voicemailwhich she didnt because she only had a pager.  Do you know how pagers work?  You send someone your phone number to call you back.  If Adnan knew that no one could get Hae to respondnot her brother not Aisha not her motherand that she was unresponsive to pages from her family and friends why do you assume hes guilty for not trying?  Isnt it completely reasonable to assume he would think its futile to page her if all these people much closer to Hae than he was couldnt reach her?The frustrating thing about this case is there isnt any hard evidence or proof.  So if you take a bias say that Adnan is guilty one can fit all the clues to support this theory.  If you take another bias say that Adnan is innocent you can make all the clues fit this theory.We only have Jays shady eye witness account of what happened and if you want to spin the bias dial to Jay did it it isnt all that hard to make the facts fit the theory.

I have had guys tell me long detailed stories about things ie captaining a luxury yacht for a billionaire oil sheik being in elite armed forces that seem completely true and believable except theyre not they are compulsive liars. Often you only catch these guys out when you hear them tell the same story you have heard to someone else and suddenly details change or are embellished.

2459214,0,t3_2npeud,I started wondering that too. Theres one comment on the podcast explanation of the timeline here See the last column where they say that Jays story in the trial is pretty consistently  hour off of the cell records. The problem with the theory by my math is that the times are off in the wrong direction. The most likely scenario would be that the cell records did not reflect Daylight Savings so no fall back. In that case they would all be an hour LATER than Jays story.It is odd that his story in the end lines up but is roughly consistently an hour off.

In one police interview Jay mentions Adnan looking like hes on LSD maybe it was a PCPlaced joint? and in another he mentions narcotics before correcting himself and saying marijuana. Adnan was in a partially druginduced dissociative state during the time of the murder. This explains the lack of a strong motive denial of premeditation and the confession in episode  that he feels somewhat responsible for what happened because of bad choices hed made...i.e. if hed been a good muslim his words this never would have happenedAny thoughts?,serialpodcast,cmghqai,1,t5_33vph

I really thought from the start that Jay was almost perfect for this and maybe thats what Adnan thought too. But perhaps the cops actually worked through the convolutions of this thing and came to the correct conclusion...?I dont know I oscillate wildly like most of us.

This is a case of murder and it might be natural for you to think that in such a case the words mean more than this. But that is not so. They do not mean that you must cast about for fantastical solutions of what seems to you plain and simple. They do not mean those nightmare doubts which sometimes torment us at four oclock in the morning when we have not slept very well.

2495521,0,t3_2o6yow,theres a few reasons why this is an extremely problematic and flawed way of thinking . I think the big thing Ive realized mostly from the subreddit is that a lot of people on here seem to think that he should act how they think he should be acting but what most people are missing is that their investment has been  weeks or less and a lot of people want his sense of outrage his emotions his words his silence his pauses to mirror what they think it should be  weeks in. Thats the only way I can explain or understand the disconnect. I think people do say I get that hes been in prison for  years BUT and I just dont think people get the  years part. like...truly internalizing it. Most people are outraged obsessed passionate and extremely engrossed and involved in this narrative. People have their opinions and their sides in this and nothings at stake for us ultimately other than a satisfying end and ultimate justice for whoever killed Hae. However none of us can really understand what a decade and a half of being in jail if hes innocent does to your emotions or rewires the way you frame arguments etc.. and yes maybe he is more over the whole thing than the listeners because the listeners have known about this for  weeks or less. This has been his nightmare of a life whether he did it or not for over  years. I personally lean more towards his innocence so I think if he didnt do it its a nightmare and theres nothing to be accomplished no justice served no meaning derived from being angry. If anything having that sustained level of anger for  years will drive a person insane.. The reason he says pathetic is because at the time he thought jay was falsely setting him up for a reward that was advertised for any information regarding Hae.. Adnan doesnt know for a fact that Jay is the killer and is unwilling to point a finger randomly because he considers himself a victim of that very thing. He firmly maintains his innocence and that he had nothing to do with Haes murder. Beyond that without proof he is unwilling to simply point the finger at someone else because if hes truly innocent he is a victim of being in prison because someone unfairly pointed the finger his way.Lastly please do not try to assess someone true and real innocence based on how angry or not they are from listening to  minutes or less of a podcast. Whatever anger sadness disappointment and frustration he has with his place in life had to be worked through or resolved. Its not fair to have an opinion on someones guilt based on such a limited and narrow perspective. ,serialpodcast,cmkawhp,8,t5_33vph

But her behavior beginning in Adnans case and continuing to the Witmans case makes me think that she had some kind of neurological disease that was progressively getting worse. It would be interesting to see if it existed an autopsy report on her  I suspect some kind of brain lesions that made her paranoid and disoriented.Overall it reminded me of that episode of This american life assuming people on here are fans of the doctor who became erratic and really had Huntingtons... Not that Gutierrez was murderous or anything like that I just sense a lack of stability on Gutierrezs part that I believe is emblematic of disease.

In the Serial case if I remember correctly the appeal seems to be based on her never even asking for a plea deal. The appeals court may not hear the latter case. An evil or desperate attorney would need to bring a new issue. Id be interested to see if the jurisdiction handling the appeal had decided that exact issue yet. If Christina didnt die she may have handled the appeal. Adnon does still trust her even after her shortfalls at trial. The most suspicious part is that in this case Christina seems to be representing the client on appeal... on claims that her own legal assistance was ineffective. And you better bet she charged him for it. Im still on the fence though. Tldr This is suspiciously similar to what Rabia is accusing Christina of and seemingly using the same method.

2510803,0,t1_cmlt2fm,First Rabia is not part of Adnans family.  She is his friends brother.  She also had almost no meaningful interaction with prior to him being arrested for murder.Second I agree that people should not call her names or be disrespectful to her because she has an opinion.  However at least some of these people are doing so because she failed to afford many others the same courtesy respect and consideration she seeks.  She excoriated someone  on this site for criticizing Adnan. She directly accused him of IIRC being a child molester and outed him personally. She routinely posts supposedly edited documents that are not really edited. Again providing any casual reader the full names of many of the witnesses and people involved in this case. She also widely speculates about who she thinks killed Hae and why they did it.  She also argues Adnans dead lawyer perpetrated a ridiculous scheme to throw the case in order to gain more money on Adnans appeal. All of those things are WAY out of bounds for any advocate lawyer any public person desirous to be taken seriously.  In fact many things she has said are borderline slander. That doesnt mean someone should think its okay to call her names just because she does the same and more to others.  It just means that perhaps everyone should step back and give her commentary the little attention it actually deserves. She is not a serious or reliable person at least as it regards to this case. The less often people put her on this pedestal she doesnt deserve the less other people will try to knock her off it.,serialpodcast,cmmatl2,13,t5_33vph
2510986,0,t1_cmmag8x,thanks for defending me! and the only reason i bolded the part about services for money was because OP ukomeht saidgt Hey law student lawyer here one of the ugly parts about law is it costs money. At least part of Rabias problem appears to be she was charging them anything at all.  dollars over the course of two trials doesnt sound outrageous or out of whack in the least. Do you have any idea how many hundreds of hours goes into preparing a case like this? You will some day.also not trying to troll anyone or fake concern. I find this heartbreaking because i paralegaled before law school and I do clinic in law school and Im an immigrant from South Asia. I just cant imagine being in ASs moms position and being hapless and so deferential to the authorities and paying an attorney hundreds and thousands of dollars and just waiting for a conversation that never comes. If thats fake okay. To me its just part of empathizing being in similar circumstances and just feeling so dejected thinking that his mom was in that situation.  anyways i figure OP is just looking for something to rage about so i think im gonna check out of the convo! theres tons of other attorneys on here that i communicate with and get along with just fine because theyre polite nice and not just looking to jump and take something offensively right off the bat for literally no reason. thanks for your kind words though ushapshapboetie!,serialpodcast,cmmbom5,2,t5_33vph

Let me give you a real example. In my city for decades the police detectives kept what they called street files of notes on crimes criminals investigations. These were NEVER turned over. They should have been. Heres just one recent story about this If you google chicago police and street files youll find dozens. Theres appellate decisions addressing it. Policies are or were supposed to require all information go in the investigation file but this was ignored. But the responsibility for turning over the materials is done by the prosecutors who are required to turn over such material. Theres always a lot of wrangling over this with the defense often charging theyre not getting what they should be but since they dont know what they dont know its hard to make that argument stick. The free friendly lawyer to Jay is a good example. It was a Brady violation to not disclose but the judge gave CG no real remedy. The only thing I wanted to add generally is the police do an investigation up to when they feel they know who did it and they then focus on that person and try and build a case against them. Thats why they dont want bad evidence that may taint their theory of the case. This can result in bad prosecutions. Memphis . ,serialpodcast,cmotnud,10,t5_33vph

The Night of Power is a real phenomenon in the Islamic tradition. Intelligence services for example always see extra chatter from jihadist networks around that night.Superstitious thinking tied to religion is also much more prevalent in the Middle East and Pakistan than in the US.But there is nothing around the Night of Power that would be likely to influence Adnan regarding the likelihood of success of getting away with a murder or being forgiven for it.A good comparison with the Night of Power in this case would be Christmas Eve. Even a Christian who doesnt literally believe every detail about Jesus birth and the three wise man happened exactly as it is described in the bible would make sure to show up for midnight mass. In fact especially those who dont usually show up every Sunday would be there doubters putting their agnosticism aside for one night. An absence would be noted.

2543550,0,t1_cmqkhyw,A few witnesses cant remember how many right now report seeing Hae and also Adnan around ish. If you believe their statements which I thought most people now do then the murder cannot have happened before the  call as the state claimed because Hae is still alive. The next ping is an incoming call off the towerantenna near Best Buy at . This  minute window is important because the murder is most likely to have occurred during it. What led Jay to Best Buy BB? Are we now to speculate that the  call was some kind of code to let Jay now that AS was going to do it and to meet at BB at ? If not then why did Jay go there? Was it a preplanned meeting? I hate speculating so I take this new timeline to mean that we just dont know what the  call was and we dont know what Jay did for  minutes until . Maybe he waited at Jenns or maybe he assisted with murder or maybe he did the murder and AS helped him. Whatever the case may be I dont see a clear alibi anymore. ,serialpodcast,cmqkuus,2,t5_33vph

2547382,0,t1_cmqzwaa,You know thats a great point. This hits on something that has been bugging me.. To me the sheer incomprehensibility of Jays statements hints at something a bit more than just a preexisting and unchanging belief among the police that Adnan did it. That something more is that theyre also assuming that Jays role in the crime is limited to what he first admits to them ie accessory after the fact. Jays statements dont just change to better implicate Adnan they also change to limit any charge against him to accessory after the fact. The dog that didnt bark here is that Jay was never really treated as a suspect in Haes murder in a meaningful way. He was treated as someone guilty only of accessory after the fact. As you point out his house wasnt searched and there was no investigation whatsoever that I am aware of into either a motive or an alibi. When you look at his statements to the police it seems nuts that he wasnt investigated for the murder itself. I mean did the police even consider the fact that the two of them did it together? Im not claiming that this was intentional on the part of the investigators. But it is weird to me and your point about this schools initiative is really interesting.

This is coming off in a confusing way but I guess what Im saying is that I agree with you. I really feel for Adnan and everyone involved with this case. It affected and continues to affect so many people in negative ways its really hard to come to terms with the fact that there wont be some sort of resolution.

2562197,0,t3_2p39x0,I agree with all your criticisms yet I also enjoy the podcast.I think that theres a way in which you could see Serial as a making of podcast for a TAL segment. A lot of the story chunks out of individual episodes you could see being polished into something on an episode on . But the suggestion I think is that theres something to this level of depth to a lot of TAL stories. Also theres a significant if not the majority of the fanbase thats not TAL aficionados. A lot of the interest is interest in the case itself not necessarily the presentation of the facts of the case as might be more expected in your traditional NPR cultural programming in general.Ive noticed I think something to Serials format where they have sort of bigger idea segment of each episode and the more precision segment of each episode. I think the goal is to manage to get people on either side of the fence but I do somewhat wonder what it would sound like if it were remixed.Also Serial is well serial. Its intentionally drawn out and supposed to be geared to create cliffhangerlike situations where you want to listen to the next episode.

He hits speedial because he either mistakenly thinks it is redial and wants to recall the last person he called or else in his panic he thinks someone other than Nisha is  on the speedial and gets it wrong.The call does go through and is something along the lines of is X there? before he realises its a wrong number and cuts the call. Nisha does not know Jay and he does not identify himself so she has no reason to remember a wrong number call. Later Jay DOES speak to her obviously from the video store  perhaps even intentionally if he has realised it was her on the murder call maybe to find out if she recognised his voice was suspicious or else much less likely to frame an alibi  and this is the call she remembers as the only time she spoke to him. In fact there were two times  this one and the murder call  but she thinks there is only one.,serialpodcast,cmug7nc,3,t5_33vph

This was not a project to put a dead girls family through heartbreak and Im tired of reading this yes its terrible but no theyre not forced to listen and in the end theres no way to reinvestigate crimes if we all conclude its not nice to do this to families of victims.

2599781,0,t1_cmxt8nx,gt No Im arguing that investigative journalism is fundamentally different in that it seeks truth through an explicitly unbiased approach.If we accept your definition then investigative journalism is too specific a term. Could we call it empirical journalism or questioning journalism or something of that nature? I think it definitely differs from the lets report on this wrongfully accused guy named Adnan in that its trying to answer a question of fact. Whether its being unbiased in that pursuit is a different story but its certainly trying to find out answers to empirical questions. I can see the argument that its biased but I cant see the argument that its just a story about Adnan and its not trying to understand what actually happened to Hae.gt The big one is one of the first things in the first episode either Jay or Adnan is lying.I dont think this is a false choice. I didnt see this as its impossible that both are lying I saw it as its impossible that both are telling the truth. The point is to make it clear that theres no chance that there was a misunderstanding or something else that could reconcile their testimony. If you think Adnan is innocent then you necessarily think that Jay is lying. And obviously if Adnan is guilty then hes lying.I actually thought that this was essentially a point against Adnan at least in terms of showing that hes definitively innocent. Koenig is establishing that any alternative theory has to explain why Jay is lying. If it were possible that Jay were somehow honestly mistaken then Don Mr. S Roy Davis and whoever else start to look like plausible suspects and there are all kinds of scenarios where Adnan is innocent. With the Jay or Adnan is lying dichotomy the best we can come up with are fairly unlikely scenarios where Jay killed Hae or is covering for someone else. Enough for reasonable doubt but not enough to really say that Adnan is innocent.,serialpodcast,cmxxfp4,1,t5_33vph

There are  more minutes of the show and thousands and thousands of pages of documents descriptions of evidence and things that investigators or detectives decided werent worth looking into. I dont think SK even mentioned the bloody shirt in the car or the wipersignal handle. We found those on our own. How much more is there that we dont know about?A shedload.Many people including lawyers dont think the jury had enough to find him guilty. But they havent heard all of the testimony statements or even  of what the jury heard.So my point isnt that Jay did it or Adnan did it my point is that we dont really have enough info to make a judgement call. Pun most definitely intended.Take this for example  do we believe in the cell tower records at all? Are they indicative of anyones location at any point in time? It depends on who you ask. Weve gotten conflicting statements on it from several people both inside and outside the podcast on what they do or dont mean. The triangulation of the antennas is huge to most peoples theories believing that you can tell which side of the tower a person is on depending on which antenna they ping but it turns out that with the technology of the time specifically in reference to Adnans model of cellphone thats not true.So do we count that information in or out? If the case came to court today it may not even be admissibleA lot of the time we dont know what we think we know and theres so much questionable stuff floating around that people can pick and choose whatever bits they want to fit their own theory.

If it wasnt Adnan and Jay it was likely Jay and someone else. The only reason Adnan is locked up is because Jays story somewhat follows the timeline after attempting to match it a few times. My guess all along is that this is all somewhat related to Jay or someone higher on the chain than him selling drugs.

Im thinking of the sway consensus has over an individuals perception of their own experience. I have a book sitting on the bookcase across the room called called Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds and just wonder...But I seriously doubt Adnans intention was to ask for a ride in order to kill Hae because as you noted that would be a ridiculous plan for a murder. Maybe Adnan planned to meet up with Jay to get his car back amp needed Hae to drive him to wherever. But I just cant get onboard with the states story. How possible is it that the state made it all up misconstruing information and feeding Jay a story? The car... Could Jay have been driving Haes car around?

The court is in no way obligated to grant the motion for DNA testing. And an appeal would be based on an abuse of discretion standard. In laymans terms the trial court has discretion to the deny the motion. Unlike with many other appealable issues an appeals court would have to find that the trial court abused its discretiona very high burden to meetin order to overturn that decision. ,serialpodcast,cn1q2on,2,t5_33vph

2633992,0,t3_2q2zi2,My theory on who the killer is and this is assuming that Adnan is in fact innocent was that the killer was no one who was talked about on the show. The killer was a friend of Jays. Possibly his drug supplier. Someone who has something on Jay to keep him silent. He met this girl and tried to force her into sexrape her. When she fought back he strangled her. Knowing that Jay knew her he was brought in to help clean up and to take the fall when cops got close. The thing that bothered me about this was that neither Jay nor Adnan has injuries. If you were being strangled wouldnt you have fought back?Though at the end of the day this is a highly unlikely theory. As much as I would like to believe Adnan based on the podcast its highly probable that he did it and is maintaining his silence or even has convinced himself that what he is saying is true.Either way.. the story was intriguing.

2665116,0,t3_2qimab,Hmm...where to start. . He has one possibly decent witness in Asia McLean but she only matters if you buy the prosecution theory that the murder occurred during the prosecutions window of    PM.  If it occurred later as seems almost certain shes of little use.  The others are basically in the same camp of memory as Adnan I probably saw was did..... Jay is lying about a lot of things and virtually no one disputes it.  The only question is what is he lying about vs. telling the truth about and which details of the myriad versions of events hes related are true and which are fabricated.. Ive seen several good cases made for it being a buttdial the best one holds that the murder was actually being committed when the Nisha call occurred and the murderer didnt realize the call had been placed until after hed subdued Hae.  Who willingly listens to a phone ring unanswered for ?.  To the cops the phone booth was of significance only to the extent that a they believed it was the come get me call immediately after Adnan is said to have murdered Hae and b in establishing the location of the murder.  But it was the prosecution  not Jay or anyone else  that created the construct that the  PM call was the come get me call Jay never said it was.  Given how many changes there were to Jays stories regarding the times and locations where things happened I doubt they wanted to hang their hat on his memory in that regard so why worry about whether there was a pay phone at Best Buy.  Frankly it was the defense that should have been looking to discredit the prosecutions theory by demonstrating there was no pay phone at Best Buy if indeed there wasnt it appears there wasnt a phone booth outside as Jay indicated but the jury is out on whether there was one in the vestibule.. I dont think Adnan was interviewed until well after the murder so any scratches might have cleared by then.  Regardless while Hae was   and athletic Adnan was   and athletic. ,serialpodcast,cn6gg25,2,t5_33vph

His attorney would have had to coach him to testify with more certainty than he had admitted about his whereabouts and then the prosecutor would have completely impeached his testimony by raising those doubts again. Though the jury wrongfully held his not testifying against him during deliberation going back to have him testify is unlikely to have helped his case because it would have relied heavily on the jury just having faith in his honesty. That is an enormous risk to take when the attorney believes there is already sufficient reasonable doubt to be created about the clients guilt.,serialpodcast,cn7n8x7,6,t5_33vph

There is a ton of merit to the conversations that have happened in this sub regarding abusive  unhealthy relationships and it is possible Adnan was abusive to Hae and there werent any overt clues to show this. However what Ive heard about Jay and Stephanies relationship is more indicative of an abusive or at least unhealthy relationship. Stephanie was Jays amazingness Jays pathological lies Stephanies family didnt like him...even the fb message he put out about exposing SK for who she really is says to me hes an egotistical person likes to be in control etc. I could see that even if he didnt overtly threaten Stephanie if she was caught up in him in an unhealthy manner she would stand by him even though he helped bury her friends body at the very least. If Jay was emotionally abusive or controlling it makes sense Stephanie would side with him no matter what. Victims of abuse often do this.Again I realize this is all total and irresponsible speculation but Ive seen as much to indicate Jay and Stephanies relationship was potentially abusive as I have that points to Adnan being abusive to Hae.,serialpodcast,cn8q6en,2,t5_33vph

Heres the further contextgtSarah Koenig said there was new evidence and I said theres no new evidence thats gonna change what I saw I saw Hae dead in the trunk of the car. If Adnan wants to take the stand now and explain that away let him. But theres no evidence thats gonna change what I saw. I dont know how she was murdered I dont know exactly how she got put in that trunk and I told the cops that. If Koenig wants to get into how that all happened she can go there.It seems like hes trying to back away from everything and make his only tie to this his claim that he saw her body in the trunk and thats it. Especially given this context in which hes saying Adnan could get on the stand and tell his side of the story if he really means here that he only knows what he saw then itd seem logical to also directly mention what Adnan told him. So If Adnan wants to get on the stand now and explain that away fine! But its not gonna change that he showed me her body in the trunk and told me he did it. It reads to me as him backing farther and farther away from any knowledge or connection he had to this. Because he did claim to know that Hae was strangled he evidently told Jenn and he told the cops at the time bc it seems his knowledge of the how she was died where her body was and where the car was is what made the cops believe him.,serialpodcast,cn9uid9,9,t5_33vph

There was no need whatsoever for Ms. vargasCooper to insult the TAL audience as a bunch of white Wire watchers and doing so was a pretty sharp jab at Koenig and The Serial its sloppy journalism for an audience you shouldnt care about.Today in deciding to answer questions Ms. VargasCooper again went out of her way to contrast herself with Koenig for no discernible reason.

Each additional appealsecond trial etc. would only add to the caseload on these defenders and might tend to widen the justice gap between rich and poor defendants.

If you liked that youre going to LOVE this. This is another textbook example of what Im talking about. We dont need another example but Ill run with it anyway. It is not a linking of the viewpoint  the viewpoint is fine. As were talking about Fascism then we should talk about Free Speech too and everyone is entitled to their own unique viewpoint. So its not about viewpoints at all  its about the methodology and what underpins the viewpoint. Viewpoints are fine. But if one is arrived at by rational thought and logic and one is arrived at by irrational bias then we can  and should  decry the latter. Volubly and often. In doing so we should not then be shouted down for actually drawing attention to problems in the process.

2714260,0,t1_cncc7y1,gt This type of reasoning really upsets me because it implies the truth of the story doesnt matter so long as hes Jay is pointing his finger in the same direction every time. So all one has to do is get on a stand and say they saw someone commit a crime and we should all be good with that without any additional details. Thats the logical implication of this type of argument the story is just a vehicle for an accusation.This type of reasoning upsets me too. Its incomplete and unscientific because it does not lend itself to an examination of other evidence which may be able to confirm its main points. I just want to emphasize that Im trying to get inside Jays own reasoning about the case.The problem here is that Jay had and still has different goals from the state authorities investigating and prosecuting the murder of Hae Min Lee The state wanted to figure out who killed her and then construct a case which could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. They settled on Adnan as the murderer and then tried to construct a case around him with some studious avoidance of any evidence or testimony that might conflict with this case justifiably criticized here and elsewhere. They used Jay as their star witness coaching and coaxing him to provide versions of his story that would be persuasive to a judge and jury. Jay didnt really care about proving Adnans guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury of his peers. Adnan was already  guilty in Jays mind and Jay felt shock over Haes murder and probably remorse at his own involvement and perhaps over having been forewarned about Adnans intentions. Adnan was already convicted in Jays mind and pretty much all Jay wanted from the criminal justice system was for Adnan to be locked away in jail. Jay had reasons to be at best ambivalent at worst hostile towards the whole criminal justice system. Some of them we may never fully understand but it cant be emphasized enough that he was a young black man in a country and a city with a lengthy history of police brutality and racial inequity in the justice system particularly concerning lowlevel drug offenses which hes admitted to repeatedly. Jay was and perhaps still is willing to bend his story to whatever it takes to achieve his goal lock Adnan up with the minimum amount of involvement and prying into him. Now you have everyone on Reddit who imagines that theres some perfect crystalclear version of this story which ought to be reconstructable based on the mess of Jays testimony and the limited physicalelectronic evidence some of which is now being reexamined. I think its unrealistic to imagine that there will ever be a conclusive clear picture however I think that this thread establishes a useful perimeter around the plausible possibilities a either Jay and Adnan were both involved in Haes murder and burial as Jay has maintained or b Jay was involved he is lying about Adnans involvement and there may be others involved.

Including  calls to Nisha  calls to Stephanie  calls to Krista and even a call to Jay... im guessing one of the reasons he didnt try to reach her until after midnight was that he knew she was out with Don and didnt want to bug her until she got home.

He even had a plan for how to call Hae without their parents getting caught and knew his aunties were helping his parents keep an eye on him.

2728978,0,t1_cndvjl5,I never bought Jays assertion that Adnan needed track practice as an alibi. First off an alibi is only relevant for the time of the murder. If he killed her and THEN went to track practice who cares? But second attendance isnt taken at track and Adnan knows that. Despite this he does nothing to make sure that everyone sees and remembers him at track. No minor injury to get documented no conversation with the coach to make sure he gets noticed no pep talk to his teammates to give them a distinct memory. Nothing. Honestly I think Jay WAS asked to be Adnans alibi but as part of his effort to minimize his involvement he wont admit that he initially agreed to lie for Adnan. I wouldnt be surprised if they had initially agreed that they would both say they were at Jenns house or at his grandmothers house at the time of the murder.

Think about itthe fact that Adnan has never said one ill word to Jay in the podcast has everyone puzzled. It also plays really well into a victim narrative. Adnans so good he wont wrongfully accuse Jay. It also keeps him from looking like precisely the kind of racist classist calculating person youd have to be to rope Jay in for the predictable criminal black fall guy.

You needed an excuse to ride with Hae gt You had to come up with a way to not have your car that day gt Get your GF a Bday present Jay gt You give Jay your car and your phone gt You get picked up by Hae because you need a ride and just want to say a few thingsMurder. Now what? Well the convenience of not having your car so you could ride with Hae cuts both ways now.... Youve complicated the crime unnecessarily because you have involved Jay. Jay doesnt even know hes involved at the time... But he has your car and your phone on the day your exGirlfriend goes missing. Thats a problem for you. Jay could start getting ideas he could start wondering what you were up to the day you gave him your car... the day your GF went missing...Why do you pop the trunk and show Jay a body? My sense is that there was some calculation there... I think Adnan must have known that Jay would conclude he was responsible for Haes disappearance... Especially if he had talked about it before. Adnan must have figured that if he had a chance to get away with it he needed to further involve Jay. I think that once Adnan was able to get the body into the trunk unseen he had to imagine that Jay was the only person who posed a threat to him. Adnan must have thought If Jay figures it out and he will then Im through. So Ill just come clean to him and hope he helps me. Adnan incredible stressed by the murder frantically calculates that keeping Jay close and controlled is a better alternative than letting Jay speculate from a distance....Adnan needs to be uptodate and aware of his perceived threats...Why would he call the Police Station after they found her body?

Maybe Jay had a larger role maybe there was a period where the phone was somewhere else to where one or both of them were but this doesnt alone undermine the case. There are certain parts of what Jay says that I simply cant get round them being the truth. I found his account to be very believable especially the interview he did for The Intercept. If my client was on trial and the witness statement looked like that barring the parts that could have been forgotton after  years then Id be very worried.If the jury believed Jay then that goes beyond reasonable doubt for me in the blink of an eye. Jay was on the stand for  days and there was no breakthrough. That really does say something.If Serial was a fictional courtroom drama then Jay would have done it in the twist ending as justice is done. But Jays story if you iron over the contradictions that he goes some way to explaining in the recent interview is simply not something one can make up fantastically on the spot and tie everything together.Ive just read that over and its pretty badly written not the best evidence of my skill at writing up case summaries really!,serialpodcast,cnhno0d,36,t5_33vph
2758795,0,t3_2rnq8o,What are I get from the responses is that commenters are angry Urick did not break down weeping and admit that he was always convinced of Adnans innocence and that he railroaded Adnan into prison. Did anyone expect anything other than a vigorous defense of the states case? Whats interesting is that he thought of this at the time as a rather run of the mill DV murder. He points out that there was not much press coverage at the time. He also points out that the apellate court didnt think much of the case either.

2795639,0,t1_cnlsx2z,Do you refer to this?The detectives subpoenaed a whole bunch of other cell phones and pagers and landlines though. At least  other numbers. We have the subpoenas and for some of these we have some basic subscriber information  like who was assigned the number and what their address was. But we dont have a detailed call record like we have for Adnans phone for anyone except Yaser and Bilal Adnans youth mentor from the mosque. It could very well be that the detectives never had this information either that all they wanted or needed was to know which number belonged to whom. But we cant help but think that some other detailed call records could have offered some valuable clues. If they or anyone had the subpoena for the Best Buy phone I assume they would have mentioned it during the kerfuffle over whether or not there was even a phone there. If the logs were requested and received theyve since gone walkabout as has anything to do with a Best Buy subpoena. Quoth Urick in the recent Intercept inteviewNow the thing about the cellphone records is that they corroborate Jay his statements that he got a call around  p.m. or around that time from Adnan to come pick him up. And the cellphone records show that there was an incoming call around that time. So theres corroboration of Jays statements to the police and the cell records.No mention there that he saw the Best Buy log showing there was a call To Adnans phone around that time which is odd as that would further corroborate Jays statement. I would suggest both these remarks point to the Best Buy logs not being requested. I think the call logs of anyone involved are of importance in working out what happened that day and the surrounding weeks. I assume if they werent sought or much bothered with it was a mix of lack of time and focus on getting a conviction as opposed to solving a crime.,serialpodcast,cnluqsw,4,t5_33vph

Its endless repetitive work cut across and intensified by yet other assumptions based on accent skin color class education dress. And its a powerful thing the learnt reflex to look at a woman and see someone who is by definition unaccomplished a novice someones disciple companion muse someone with no power or expertise of her own. Im not immune to it  Ive caught myself in the act of underestimating women of having assumed that the woman in the room isnt the expert in the room.

2802334,0,t1_cnmlj78,I thought the fact that the second cop cites the Adcock call and reports that Adnan said Adcock was incorrect meant that Adnan had said that.  Then we find out that both officers are referring to documentation from much later and do not specifically refer to typing those up from handwritten notes or anything.A new level of murkiness is introduced. If the files include police notes from missing persons where Adcock wrote that down or a other friend said something about a ride  that would help. From a whats likely standpoint  a high school senior with free time and no car  could easily have wanted a ride off campus. My problem is that after we started getting postpodcast evidence we have documentation of Jay under pressure to make this premeditated  has a ride story and then there no reference until the murder investigation focused on Adnan. At that point people are asked specifically about Adnan asking Hae for a ride. One person agrees that she heard something about it.

2804104,0,t1_cnmcc7f,I have to admit that Im quite surprised by all of these claims of my being a racist. My girlfriend who is Korean by the way was perceptive enough to say that Watch people will start spouting out claims of racism.I feel many of you havent read the entirety of our posts. Furthermore very early on I addressed the fact that I made a mistake in calling an Islamic Republic Pakistan an Arabic country. I posted my original post at about  A.M. and I do apologize for it seeming insensitive to Pakistanis.Heres where I am upset with readers calling me a racist At no point do I claim that Adnan had drug ties from the beginning. The justice department around this time published a report saying that Pakistani smuggling of heroin was becoming a huge problem. The Pakistani community was notoriously tight lipped about reporting any of these illegal activities. Furthermore in such a tight knit community it wouldnt be so outlandish to assume that if Adnan were interested in upping his cred by getting harder drugs that he would be able to track someone down who did supply through various rumors in his community.Pakistan is known to be one of the largest suppliers of heroin in the world. It is not so far fetched to assume that actual Pakistanis had PakistaniAmerican contacts in Baltimore which had an enormous heroin problem at the timeHeroin has been smuggled into Maryland through the Port of Baltimore but to a much lesser extent than by land or air. The DEA Washington Division reports that small quantities of Southwest Asian heroin are transported to the Baltimore area through the Port of Baltimore. In  the USCS seized multigram quantities of Southwest Asian heroin from crew members aboard Pakistani ships entering the Port of Baltimore. The heroin in these shipments usually was destined for distribution in Pakistani communities in Prince Georges and western Anne Arundel Counties.We chose heroin because both us agreed that a killing would not have occurred if there were some drama over a lesser drug. It is not racist to be using unbiased published reports to illustrate our theories.Finally to illustrate the violence of the heroin trade in Baltimore at the time there were  drug heroin dealerssmugglers caught during this time charged with the murders of  people.  of these people was a girl who got caught in the crossfire of a shoot out. The explanation of a heroin deal gone awry to us fits perfectly with the events that transpired and explains the dynamic between Adnan and Jay. We believe this was a first time deal trying to get heroin from a previously unknown contact and that Hae Min had somehow got involved and tried stopping it or reporting it. This resulted in her death.,serialpodcast,cnmtf6s,3,t5_33vph

Not following up in finding out if a plea deal was on the table despite clear instructions to do so from the client you know the one paying her.   To not use Asia is potentially a matter of strategy.  But to not even interview her?  The family was practically begging her to follow up on that.  Again it is disregarding a reasonable request from the client.  Each of these is a basis for an inadequate council appeal.  None of those are small mistakes.  When your lawyer isnt doing what shes specifically asked to do thats not a trivial problem.  Note  These problems dont magically change when actually reading the transcript. Those facts alone can be used to make a solid case that she wasnt a good lawyer.  To dismiss those claims as You dont know what youre talking about trivializes those mistakes as eh these things happen.  No trial lawyer should EVER make mistakes like that.

Cell phone was tracked as NOT being anywhere near Jenns house from    PM.Note The Nokia  phone had the ability of onetouch dialing so it cant be ruled out that it wasnt possible Nishas number was on speeddial or as Nokia describes it onetouch dialing. . Was there a Shovel or shovels? . Did Jay ever actually end up going to Stephanies after getting picked up from Jenn at  like she claims?a.

Something Stephanie would most certainly remember . Did anyone other than Hae and Adnan know Jay had cheated on Stephanie? a. Did anyone know Hae knew Jay was cheating on Stephanie other than Adnan?  a. Or better did anyone know Hae or Adnan suspected that Jay had been cheating on Stephanie?

We have no way of knowing if Adnan checking his voicemail from Leakin Park was the detail that swayed a jurors vote but we do know that never actually happened.

2862546,0,t1_cntg7qn,gt There is very compelling evidence that Adnans phone and Adnan were in very near proximity to both Haes burial location and her ditched car at that very time and at a time that Adnan claims he was at the mosque. The phone medium reliability. Towerantenna tracking is not an exact science. Tower match via ATampT expert was not done until  months later and no raw tower dump was available for examination. Furthermore theres the ATampT disclaimer that the tower displayed may be of the CALLER for incoming calls. Adnan being with the phone... also medium reliability no other corroborating proof. The only thing we know reasonably sure is they left Cathys with the phone at  ish. Its reasonable to assume Adnan is with the phone but not certain. As for him showing up in Leakin Park and Edmundson near car dump towers theres not enough information. If he NEVER went that way before EVER then sure thats damning. But just ONE occurrance? Could be merely coincidence. Adnans main problem is his lack of alibi. I personally dont consider his statements to be reliable only somewhat more reliable than Jays and much of his testimony need to be discarded because theyre probably postfactor reconstructions i.e. I should have been at . The difference here is how the states case depends on Jays testimony and by interpreting or misinterpreting if you believe Rabia and SS the cell phone tower evidence to fit Jays testimony and by telling the jurors to look at the big picture i.e. ignore these problems when they dont fit. If you ignore Adnans bad testimony i.e. what he told detectives and his resconstructions of his activities he simply have a sorry defense and no alibi. If you ignore Jays changing story altogether then Urick would have had no case at all. One more reason Im still undecided. I think Adnan know something that hes not telling whether on purpose or even he had forgotten it. Im just not quite convinced that its HMLs murder. ,serialpodcast,cnth1b3,1,t5_33vph

Previous violence also precedes  of lethal violenceSorry I misread what you put. I guess it means when that violent incident gets reported and is recorded officially in statistics. So if police or whoever ask Was this the first time? It is according to our records and that person says No my partner has been violent but I never reported it then there is previous violence.

He was heavily involved in the event and he got zero jail time. He lied to police multiple times and they still eventually believed everything he said. He tried story after story and none of them worked but they got closer to what the cops wanted each time. He still says he didnt get the call until  because he knows if he ever gave up the real truth that he was in the Best Buy parking lot when Hae went missing calls log can confirm this hed be in the place the murder happened when it was happening thus implicating himself further than hes comfortable with. So he doesnt really give the cops what they want and what he does give them is actually so suspicious that it would lead you to believe that he is more involved. But the police dont investigate him any further they accept what he says they give him immunity for the crime he committed the lying the obstruction of justice then the jury buys it then he perjures the whole story years later and still no repercussions.

2931628,0,t1_co1ay4g,gt Aisha who doesnt particularly like Adnan never thought that meant anything so why should we? Is this a talking point? Ive seen this exact thing posted elsewhere and I dont know where it comes from. Aisha may have read the note and exchanged joking comments with Adnan about it but she never saw the Im going to kill part. That was added later. The note from Hae to Adnan is one of those things that has to be taken in context. And the context is that Hae was murdered. If she was working at LensCrafters today it would just be a note in a box somewhere. ,serialpodcast,co1c67b,2,t5_33vph

2933362,0,t1_co1ccx7,I could mount a counter argument to each of your points but will resist due to time.  What I will say is read Fergusons view an exonere who spent over  years in prison for the crimes of another.  He weighs in on the Adnan debate and his actions regarding some of your points.  Also if you have time watch this documentary by the innocence project  ... you will see that Adnan fits the characteristics of most of the wrongly convicted in the documentary.  Great documentary by the way.  Demonstrable proof is the legal requirement for a finding of guilty.  The only thing demonstrable about Adnans case is that he was stoned to the point of comatose cathys description on the evening when he should have been burying a body and by all accounts of both Cathy and Jen Jay was behaving weird and all hyped up.  Jay got an easy ride Jen got an easy ride and all Jays contacts on the day such as Phil got an easy ride.  A hard working detective could have solved this case beyond doubt within a few days and some extra interviews and digging.

2941427,0,t1_co2c9t7,Yeah. I think Krista was trying to reach Adnan around . Maybe by paging him first. But they didnt connect. At Cathys Adnan receives calls from Aisha and Haes brother at  and  yet still doesnt call any friends to see if they know anything about Hae. Youd think hed make one call to someone. At  Adcock calls and talks to Adnan for five minutes. Adnan and Jay split as soon as Adcock hangs up. From there the phone goes to probably pick up the Nissan it calls Jen and Yasser from there then goes straight to the burial site then to the location where Haes car was abandoned. Youre right. In all that time Adnan never tries to reach one of Haes friends. He tries to reach Nisha first when its all over and hes left Jay. And then calls Krista at PM and talks to her for  minutes. So the PM call to Krista is three hours after Adnan first learned that Hae went missing. ,serialpodcast,co2gbrk,1,t5_33vph

This was their first season and they were doing something no one has ever done before so its reasonable that there were mistakes along the way. I hope season  takes some of season s learnings and makes the most of them. Conceptually the weekbyweek journeyoverdestination idea is a very cool and innovative one. I just think starting out with true crime may have been a fumble. I hope they do more investigative work or unravel mysteries that have nothing to do with crime or its perpetrators. Perhaps something scientific. Who knows? Just something that even if unsolved will leave people feeling wonder and excitement. Serial did not end in a way that could possibly produce positive feelings. Either an innocent man is in jail a guilty man is trying to get out of jail and regardless of the first two the entire trial and conduct of law enforcement was a shitshow.

2987148,0,t1_co7jdgm,gt More than  in  women . and more than  in  men . in the United States have experienced rape physiWith all due respect I am confused by some of your comments and disagree with others. The good news is we do agree on some. My outlook isAll murder is wrongThe only mitigating circumstances should be where there is a history of violent abuseI find the argument about premeditation versus not incomplete. In his book Why Does He Do That Lundy Bancroft global expert on men who abuse their partners says in his experience these men say they were overcome by emotions or feelings but that they are lying. It is distracting away from the fact that its their thinking that is perverted. That is they feel they have a right to harm their partner if they wont behave as they want them to. So using his experience the overcome by emotion argument is not valid. It is the thinking that is wrong  their entitlement. There are different degrees of premeditation. I would argue thinking about Im going to kill her shows a conscious choice to proceed i.e. some element of aforethought. On a continuum some premeditation for example would be deciding upon what weapon to use planning how to isolate the victim reconnoitering burial sites up to more elaborate and complex planning and organization. Theres a recidivism rate of around . Sentencing someone to a lighter sentence and then releasing them to reoffend actually does more harm than keeping someone permanently confined. My primary concern is the safety of women and children. So I have concerns about the fact that the current model of punishment is not effective enough at keeping them safe.The link you provided is not to the Report you referenced nor does it provide the stats you quoted  in fact those stats look wrong to me. The report it linked to is Full Report of the Prevalence Incidence and Consequences of Violence Against Women and includes the headings Violence Against Women Is Predominantly Intimate Partner Violence Violence Against Women and Men Is Predominantly Male Violence I know male on male violence is a big problem. However this case is not that hence why I confine my views to male on female violence. In fact I discovered recently that more people commit suicide than are murdered overall. I dont feel the need to mention that when others are discussing the murder of a female. Also theres something insidious and quite deceptive when someone who tells you they love you then proceeds to harm you. Arguably much more insidious than other forms of violence  but I dont want to get into that. Regarding my stats  oI actually downplayed this one from  to   About  of IPV against females was committed by male offendersoRe percentage of people who batter again Lundy Bancroft quoted around  are male by memory but I dont have the book to hand to give a page number. The gross figure is accurate minus at worse .Thanks for the challenge!,serialpodcast,co7m5gr,2,t5_33vph

I looked up at my rescuer  tall dark and handsome  and I was completely smitten  and he became a boyfriend for a while.Some time later I dont remember how long after we talked about how we met.  He remembered me bursting into tears and having to comfort me.I have absolutely no recollection of crying.  I was upset  but not that upset.We both absolutely believe this contradictory detail  cryingnot crying .To me this is analogous to asking Hae for a ride Adnan was upset Adnan said what am I going to say x or y saw Hae or Adnan.Loftus research suggests that more emotionally charged the memory is the more youre asked to repeat it and  perhaps  shaped to see it a particular way by  perhaps  the detectives the less accurate the memory becomes and the more strongly you believe the memory to be true.It is really fascinating!

Also do we know if the burial spot was perfectly flat?  I would assume any deviation in terrain from flat would also skew the lividity as it is the result of gravity  by this I mean and I am not saying this was the case a person lying on their stomach on a hillside at a  degree angle.

I thought the podcast was wonderful.  It told a very complex human story with some great investigation into ideas of truth guiltinnocence and the limitations of the narrative as form for a story.  I felt compassion for people who most likely didnt deserve it.  By itself that is quite the feat for any storyteller.  What keeps me coming back to this sub is when people who were involved in someway comment.  It makes the story so much deeper and more alive!  I love it.  I love the drama.  I love the extra information.  I have a guilty pleasure in the fights.  I do not like when Sarah or the podcast is attacked.  I just dont look at it simply as an expose or an attempt to liberate Adnan or vilify jay.   This was a well done piece of storytelling cemented in actual events.  I also was really sickened when some attempted to contact or harass Jay IRL.  I think also people need to back off from the prosecutor.  We simply do not know the full story.  We do not know his motivations.  We are jeopardizing a mans career and reputation on narratives and memories  both of which this Podcast has tried to show as untrustworthy.

Lets put it this way  Adnan and Hae were together for quite some time having sex in the best buy parking and hiding it from their parents. He knows better than most that shes not the person her family thinks she is. Would he be alarmed that she forgot to pick up her cousin? Sure its out of character but is it something Adnan would think is reportable to the police? Without the hindsight that we have today I consider it unlikely.

This was not something that Dr. Dixon said in Wiggins it was just my own assumption. According to the experts from today there would be more side lividity than front lividity under these circumstances but the mixed pattern would certainly be noted in an autopsy and an expert would certainly testify that that body was moved before lividity became fixed. Moreover if the new timeline created by witnesses like Summer i.e. death closer to  is right a burial in the  hour would mean a more balanced mix of lividity assuming the position of the body changed e.g. from being on the side to being face down.,serialpodcast,codpe7f,5,t5_33vph

3051676,0,t1_coe4wt7,gtBut logic and history mostly tells us that you are more likely to be wrong about his alibi than the DNA be doctored. Plus if you could prove he was across town you would do so given there are ways to prove such a thing without admitting to an additional crime.It is a hypothetical Imagine... in which we assume that the alibi is true and that there is no way of establishing the alibi without inculpating your client in another serious crime. Such scenarios do arise in reality I can assure you. Think about it this way. On his crosstown excursion your client did not take his cell phone cause he was going to commit a crime was not seen by anyone cause he was going to commit a crime did not buy anything cause he was going to commit a crime  in other words he deliberately structured his affairs so as to hide the fact that he was going to be across town because he knew he was going there to commit a crime and did not want to generate evidence which could be used against him. But you know your clients story is true because he shows you evidence linking him to the actual crime a robbery victims wallet for instance. Ill add that the question of what is more likely to have happened is entirely irrelevant at this stage because you know what actually happened you just cant prove it in court without harming your client.gt But the incongruity here is that his defenders say they do know the answer to this but dont want to ask anyway. There is really no reason to not test it beyond not actual being sure he is  innocent. They are not only saying he shouldnt be in jail but rather that he is  innocent. The only way to possibly prove that is testing the DNA. Why dont they want to do that?Because of the possibility that the State may have tampered with the DNA evidence in order to inculpate Syed. It is one thing to say I believe Syed is  innocent which I do not by the way. It is another thing to say I believe the State has been forthright and responsible in its handling of the DNA evidence despite its troubling shortcomings in almost every other arena of activity. ,serialpodcast,coeayuo,1,t5_33vph
3051969,0,t1_coeb1gk,You can see some of the appeal documents here Immediately after Adnan lost his trial and was sentenced he appealed. That took about  years and ended when the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the conviction in .At this point Adnans family had no lawyers the ordinary appeals process was exhausted and they were probably rather short on money so I assume not much happened on the case. They got a new lawyer however who started things up again in  with the post conviction hearing. It seems plausible to me that the new lawyer may have started working on the case as much as a couple years earlier too to begin investigating the Asia issue and getting familiar with all the issues regarding the case. But I doubt he started working prior to .Anyway if they arent successful here they can argue actual innocence based on new evidence as frequently as they come up with new evidence which is the approach the innocence project is taking and they may be able to make some of the arguments they made in state court in federal court. If Adnan stays in jail they could conceivably keep trying to file appeals based on new evidence for the rest of his life.The key is that the appeals process isnt one single thing its a bunch of individual appeals all of which have their own timing and exhaustion requirements.,serialpodcast,coec275,5,t5_33vph

3060444,0,t1_coevmx4,gtIs it some kind of sexual attraction thing then. For some people yes Some people are turned on by the idea of a partner who has done something horrible andor illegal. But obviously not everyone writing to a person in prison is doing it to pursue a sexualromantic relationship. Sometimes its because of curiosity sometimes its because they think the person is innocent sometimes religious people write to convicts hoping to convertsave them etc.gtBy that chart if it is an attraction thing  in  or so men should be courting women prisoners.Huh? Im not sure I understand where youre getting that from.My point was that one of the reasons we probably see a lot more male convicts being pursued by females on the outside is simply because there are vastly more men in the prison system. So even if we assume that both men and women are equally as likely to have this attraction to criminals I think well always see more women pursuing male convicts simply because theres so many more male convicts to be pursued.Also we know that people convicted of higher profile more serious crimes mass murderersserial killers like Manson and Bundy get more attention more letters etc. The demographics of that particular segment of the prison population is even more heavily skewed towards being male. ,serialpodcast,cof7n8e,1,t5_33vph

Im not Muslim but got a pretty bitter taste of what it was like or to be clear I observed my parents having that experience. Im an atheist and disdain all religions equally. That being said plenty of evidence in terms of the sociopolitical climate exists to validate the fact that Muslims were stereotyped and that antiMuslim sentiments existed pre. When all other racial minorities faced and continue to face bigotry why would anyone think Muslims didnt? Did it get WORSE after ? Of course but to pretend it didnt exist at all is just ignorant.

Adnan says he dropped Jay off after track and went to mosque.  He didnt say if he lent his phone or car out to Jay during that time.  Though looking at his call log means Jay probably didnt have his phone since all the calls from the remainder of the evening were only outgoing and to Adnans friends including Nisha at  and  who only remembers talking to Jay once with Adnan present. ampnbspIts too hard to approach the after Cathys until the end of mosque scenario of events without lacing it all with heavy speculation.  I cant pretend to know CGs strategy if any but I do wonder why she said she didnt even care about the phone records when that was the Prosecutions only crutch to hold up Jays limping testimony onthats what makes me wonder if she were representing a confessed client and simply didnt have the gumption to careor if she were too sick to continue yet pressed on regardless for what we can only presume were monetary andor pride reasons.  With the lividity perhaps the backseats were flat in Haes car and her upper half was elevated on an incline with her face and chest being at the lower gravitational point for Xdeath time until Xburial time.

After encountering the Syed defense team I began to have many case questions that I did not want to ask the Syed defense team. After not knowing who else to contact I made telephone contact with one of the State prosecutors from the case Kevin Urick. gtTwentyseven. I had a telephone conversation with Urick in which I asked him why I was being contacted and what was going on in the case. gtTwentyeight Urick discussed the evidence of the case in a manner that seemed designed to get me to think Syed was guilty and that I should not bother participating in the case by telling what I knew about January  . Urick convinced me into believing that I should not participate in any ongoing proceedings. Based on my conversation with Kevin Urick the comments made by him and what he conveyed to me during that conversation I determined that I wished to have no further involvement with the Syed defense team at that time.Do you think it is fair to characterize these paragraphs as evincing Asias fear of the Syed defense team and supporters?,serialpodcast,coiaz42,78,t5_33vph

3093842,0,t1_coindtc,But the point is that CG would have had to prepare with the larger timeline in mind.  Uricks dead by  claim only came up at the end of the case in closing argument I dont even know whether it was in his initial summation or rebuttal.   Theres no point in presenting a witness who cant cover the whole time line because the jury notices the gaps. So to put on a witness who says   and then no one who can even affirm that Adnan showed up to track practice on time just kind of highlights the part that is missing for the jury.And even if you argue it to be a mistake for CG  she should have had the witness ready just in case which I disagree with but I can see the argument  you are still stuck with the fact that it was only after the defense rested that Urick is making his argument.  Hes obviously a smart lawyer  Im guessing he would have been prepared to argue either the  or the  calls as being the comeandgetme call  he might have liked  because he could anticipate that Adnan might have some track buddies willing to testify that he arrived to track on time.  Then when it was time for him to sum up he just ran with that argument knowing that if the jury was skeptical about he  call they would have  as a fall back and could still convict.   As to its possible and we will never know  the problem for Adnan legally is that to win on a postconviction attack he has the burden of proof  and it has to make an affirmative showing that moves from the realm of possibility to probability.  Courts dont like to reverse convictions.  There is a tough legal standard.  And I just dont see how that legal standard comes close to being met in this case.,serialpodcast,coiobmu,1,t5_33vph

Someone saying Im guilty doesnt mean they are taking responsibility for the crime. It just means that either a they are guilty and know they are fuckedwant to get out or b they are innocent but scared of serving the larger sentence. I know I will probably get downvoted and told what a heartless glitch I am but truthfully I do not think the victims family should be involved in legal matters at all in any stage.

After she writes the letters she is ignored. Well thats fair she signs the affidavit. And then hears nothing for a decade. I think a reasonable conclusion would be that since she was never called to testify or anything when she saw Adnan was unimportant and the jury verdict means the right person is likely in jail.Yes but why do assume Rabia never mentioned her importance or the significance of her testimony?gt When Asia wrote the letters she intended to say that she clearly remembered seeing Adnan on January  at the library around . She noticed that some people misinterpreted the letters in serial and here. So when she got involved in the case she corrected the ambiguities.She says the ambiguities on Serial. The corrections occurred between a few months ago and now. gt Her strategy was to discredit the states witnesses which is only a strategy in the most technical sense. Its more of a baseline expectation in any case. That benefits just as much from preparation and investigation as creating your own narrative of events.But no one can do that even until this day.  If she was intended to put forth an alibi defense she knows that the state tearing that apart will ensure Adnans conviction.  Its a very risky move when there are huge holes in his alibi. gt Personal experience. I cant explain a good reason why I think it would improve their cases substantially if they prepared them better. I assume they get by most of the time because cops are professional witnesses but it really screws them up occasionally.Are you talking about the state in general or this these specific prosecutors?gt So you mean to tell me with a straight face that every piece of information she remembers regarding meeting Adnan in the library is either in one of her letters or one of her affidavits?No I am saying that while an affidavit is not a complete account of everything she saw the recent affidavit omits and modifies things that are inconvenient to the defense.

3096700,0,t1_coied45,gt I think its  impossible that she didnt also ask And do you have footage from Jan. ? or How long do you keep the footage?Not impossible at all. What youre missing here is the line between information a businessinstitution will readily give the general public and information that should remain within the organization unless subpoenaed etc.. Ive worked a lot of retail jobs and its not unheard of for people to ask whether we have security cameras for various reasons. More importantly the fact that we have cameras is something that most of my employers wanted disseminated. It is information that almost any organization will be happy to volunteer. Makes them less likely to be a target of crime etc..However no member of the public has ever asked about our tape retention policy or whether we had tape for a particular day. And more importantly if they had asked I would never have told them. An organizations security tape retention policy is usually sensitive information that is not supposed to be made public. The other thing to note is that young people might not be aware that there is such a thing as security tape reuse. I remember thinking when I was quite young that all security footage would obviously be kept indefinitely and being shocked upon learning at my first job that the tapes were reused.I find it entirely understandable even probable that Asia would ask the library whether they have cameras without asking about Jan  in particular. This could have been either on the naive belief that if they have cameras then of course they would have footage from Jan  or on the understanding that inquiries about specific days andor retention policies should properly be made by the authorities or via subpoena.,serialpodcast,coiz0an,1,t5_33vph

Almost certainly not but I think the fact that he got off was a good in thing in larger sense. Truth is not some demonstrably thing in the vast majority of cases given when we are dealing with people with fallible memories and biases. Its almost an impossible standard. For example lets say some guy stabs his wife in her sleep and then tells the cops an intruder must have come in through an open window and did it. How do you determine the truth?  Doubly so if there is no physical evidence to implicate him. All you are left with is where the evidence leads you and what it allows you to demonstrate to a beyond a reasonable doubt standard.  That doesnt get you the truth just an approximation of it based on the evidence available. Thats why the truth doesnt really matter as an abstract concept. Justice as a concept is similarly problematic. What is just to some is not just to others.

All you can do is make mountains out of mole hills on this highly circumstantial evidence. In any semi serious relationship there is a normal and typical level of possessiveness and jealousy. In teenage relationships this tends to be more pronounced as the feelings are new and teenagers generally dont have the maturity or experience to deal with them in a manner to be completely without criticism by people like you.In addition the testimonies and examples you reference are tainted by the death of Hae. The people testifying are now viewing these things from the perspective of the State accusing Adnan of murdering Hae and now these things which might have been annoying but innocent are changing in their minds as they reassess them under the possibility that Adnan killed Hae.These arguments are a pure red herring though. As any semi serious relationship where one or both partners care about each other are going to have these contentions by one or the other or both. At best your argument is a statistical anomaly as there are millions of relationships that would have the same evidence you are bringing forth that had no violence or abuse in them.gtYour suggestion that we sweep it under the rug is part of the problem.If you strongly believe that this is something that needs to be addressed in society I suggest you go find a proper sub to discuss it in.

Timeline Simpson alleges Haes drug use Simpson after being called on this says that her sources are Reddit threads Rabia and Saad and says that she does not rely on sources that she doesnt disclose Weeks later Rabia presents two lines of H. M. Lees diary out of context and claims that actually these two lines were one of the things Simpson was basing the drug allegation on Conclusion Yeah Rabia is lying.  Simpson thought that she could float the drug theory in a much more public way because it had been floated here by anonymous redditors.  She maybe didnt get that it is totally different to start a humble reddit thread saying like But what if Hae were trying to buy drugs? than to allege in a public and formal forum that H. M. Lee actually was using drugs.  After the controversy Rabia has now found something that out of context looks suggestive but not conclusive that Lee may have at least some of the time used some kind of drugs.  This is one of those cases where the coverup is arguably worse than the initial offense because we see how willing Rabia is to lie.  She could easily write in her blog Hey in case you dont trust Adnan about Haes drug use I just stumbled upon this snippet of her diary that sure makes it look like that was the case but no shes got to spin this tale where Simpson was always referring to the diary but just wasnt willing to say she was referring to the diary.  ,serialpodcast,cp9cvt7,12,t5_33vph

And Jay might have stumbled on the car and recognized it as Haes  he stated at trial he went to the area where the car was located on unrelated business. But when you look at all the things knew and the car seems like the most meaningful one here you have to wonder how much information the police were dumping on him and what a coincidence it was that he saw and recognized the car.Im not sure I get ya. If JW stumbled on the car and the cops fed him all of the other nonpublic info about the burial and murder then I would wonder why not just say I stumbled on the car and why bring Jenn into it? I think your answer would be that they got a false confession out of him in order to help them nail AS their primary suspect. The idea that the cops would essentially force the person who randomly found the car to make up his role in the whole murderburial story in order for them to pin the murder on AS is hard for me to believe but not impossible.

3448172,0,t1_cpl9vkz,The reason I made a distinction of how long postautopsy versus how long postdisappearance is that they could have had new evidence of suspects beyond the exboyfriend once there was a body and a crime scene and then again when there was a car with some unidentified fingerprints and a missing walletpursepager but not missing other identifying objects if those things were tossed to prevent knowing whose car it was. Prior to the body discovery they were simply going on very little evidence so I fail to see where they drew such a conclusion that theyd solved the case that they would convene a grand jury within a week of the body being discovered and still without recovering her vehicle. While physical evidence may not play a primary role in making a case against someone the amount of laterdiscovered latertested physical evidence that does help to exonerate convicted persons should indicate that the discovery and testing of such evidence should at least be pursued when you have little else to go on that is indisputably damning. To put it in the context of this case When you have no witnesses who state there was hostility between the victim and your suspect no one confirming the suspect went into the victims car the day she disappeared why would you hone in on one suspect and not at least test physical items more thoroughly as they are uncovered when what little physical evidence was tested did not implicate your suspect? I mean how many kids at school were even interviewed before Adnan was arrested? Krista said she never spoke to the police about the ride request until after Adnans arrest. When was Becky the person who claimed Hae changed her mind about giving Adnan a ride after school just before she went missing with the two parting ways after this incident and Adnan not trying to insist he needed that ride first interviewed? Not until a month after Adnan was arrested? I just dont understand what exactly led the detectives to be so certain Adnan was their guy before any of the evidence they gathered before Haes body was found or before the cell phone records or before they searched his house or before Jay. Some contradictory notes from two different detectives about the victims exboyfriend regarding a ride in the victims car that day and an outofarea anonymous call that turns out to not have even accurately portrayed the details or participants of the crime implicating Yassir but not Jay?

Stephanie first spoke with Adnan about it at this time and he also told her he heard Hae had run away. Maybe thats too much though. just my thoughts I understand if you wouldnt want to get to wordy with it and therefore chose to do it the way you did.

Defining reasonable doubt is one of the great exercises in the law. If you are ever on a jury in a criminal case the judge will give you a definition of reasonable doubt. It will go something like this which is taken from the Maryland Pattern Jury Instruction ManualgtA reasonable doubt is a doubt founded upon reason. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt requires such proof as would convince you of the truth of a fact to the extent that you would be willing to act upon such belief without reservation in an important matter in your own business or personal affairs. However if you are not satisfied of the defendants guilt to that extent then reasonable doubt exists and the defendant must be found not guilty.,serialpodcast,cpup660,6,t5_33vph

I said I sat there with a look of puzzlement on my face like... like... what did I do? Thats a direct quote from your OP.You said. a look of puzzlement on my face Like Like.. What did I do? This is a HUGE MOMENT.How can that be a huge moment for Adnan to say it but not a huge moment when I say it? Because hes presumed guilty but I was presumed innocent?I cant pick those words apart without the full history of someones life. Why some words make them cringe why some make them feel comforted. Especially someone from a bilingual household whos parents are from a culture quite different from mine.Your whole argument is I dont understand it  and I wouldnt say it that way  so obviously hes guilty.The thing you indicated is a speech pattern thats not congruent with your own not any form of evidence. All we know from this post is that you and AS dont speak the same and dont form sentences the same way.Lets not forget that he comes from a multilingual household. The language his parents speak and the language he heard at the mosque doesnt use words the way we do. Anyone who has studied foreign or ancient languages can easily tell you a story of a time that they were misinterpreted or had difficulty expressing their sentiments because those sentiments couldnt be expressed.Koren for example does not have a verbal sentiment for regret. There are no translations for could have or should have. Because their culture doesnt express itself that way. Their culture doesnt reassess the past. The question here is whether his words alone are expressive of guilt. They arent. You are ascribing the guilt. And I have provided reasonable doubt  beyond reasonable doubt  to show that those words are not evidence of guilt. By assuming that hes expressing guilt for telling a story from a perspective other than the one you would choose you arent subscribing yourself to the law youre subscribing yourself to assumptions and judgments. Left brain vs. right brain. One analyzes the situation the other infuses expectations and judges situations. Its not wrong! Its not bad! Despite what Reddit says. It just is.Before I jump on the hes obviously guilty because he didnt do what I would want him to do train I want to be absolutely sure I want to buy the ticket. All of his life is a paradigm  just like yours is. And just like mine. And this specific piece of evidence is not evidence.Its semantics.I wont assume hes guilty because he uses words differently than I do. If I consider him guilty it will be for evidence not assumption.Edited for a bit of clarity. I had an old thought in there that I forgot to remove.

3568884,1,t1_cpz21pe,You misread my point.  I wasnt trying to say that it would be coincidental for it to have an innocent reasoning behind it  I was saying that the evidence condoning him is at best coincidental.  For that I think of evidence like the note  a note from a few months ago before they got back together with something that could easily be either incriminating or innocent while the other side of the paper is from the victim.  I could see how that would be thought of as evidence but to me it is way too big of a coincidence to definitively say anything.As for your example its a perfect example of something that I would consider to be something with an easily explainable innocent possibility.  Jay had the car  everyone agrees on that.  If he wanted to say for whatever reason that Hae was not killed at the school it only makes sense that Adnan would have to get a ride to the location.  Him wanting to be alone with her by asking for a ride is not a huge leap from that.  Also the ride was not mentioned in the first interview though which leads me to think that whether or not the detectives meant it that way it could be a result of some leading questions.  So while its easily possible that Jay is telling the truth its also easily possible that Jay is lying so I dont feel that is proof that Adnan is more likely to have done it.Luck is a factor in this case no matter how you look at it.  Either Adnan is innocent and is very very very unlucky or hes guilty and hes very very very lucky that theres so little evidence and such bad testimony that people are still trying to get him out of prison.,serialpodcast,cpz2w0w,-1,t5_33vph

He had bacon and eggs for breakfast? But he told everyone he had sausage and eggs for no apparent reason.Someone like that could easily start accusing the ex boyfriend Adnan did it and when people didnt he believe him hed add just a bit more lie to convince them. Adnan told me he killed her. or I saw the body. It would be one small step after another. By the time the police got involved he was so far out on a limb that he was threatened that if he didnt give up Adnan the police would charge Jay. So Jay started using his lying skills to create a story the police would believe. After several revisions with the police input they went to trial. I think by then Jay actually believed Adnan had killed Hae and was willing to keep lying to keep himself out of jail and to put away Adnan.TLDR It happened in little baby steps.,serialpodcast,cq1e4th,8,t5_33vph

The caller doesnt mention a trunk pop or strangulation or a gas station or Best Buythe things that might lead one to believe he actually had knowledge of the crime.The intention of the call is to put suspicion on the boyfriend but the caller speaks of nothing that even remotely implies direct knowledge of the crime itself.  ,serialpodcast,cq4itqh,2,t5_33vph
3618237,0,t1_cq4j1ef,Its become a cliche around here but that maxim about it being better that  guilty people go free than  innocent be imprisoned. Thats a sentiment I can get behind. I think we should make it particularly difficult for people to be imprisoned without being certain they did it. Mistakes happen people are fallible doesnt cut it for me when youre putting people away for life in prison. Prison is a forprofit industry and the police and prosecutors are perfectly happy to send people away. It makes it seem as though the city is doing something to make people safer but its just an illusion mostly built on racism and fear of the poor. Prisons dont even rehabilitate people when you look at the stats. Theyre more likely to be a graduate school for criminals than anything else. I think we should move toward the abolition of prisons.Adnan should never have gone to prison in the first place with the case that was brought against him. The Baltimore PD used techniques at that time that are no longer standard operating procedure because they caused problems. Im not interested in playing some theoretical game about burden of proof. We need to stop putting innocent people in prison.,serialpodcast,cq4pe7g,4,t5_33vph

3676967,0,t1_cqarjcd,gt Interesting to see that Profs sources think Hae was initially face down for at least  hours and quite probably closer to  hours after her death.That conclusion really isnt warranted because lividity doesnt set in immediately.  There is a period of up to about  hours when lividity would not yet be apparent and a period of up to about  hours postmortem when lividity would be displaceable if the body position was shifted  that is when it would still be possible for the initial lividity to disappear.   Then up to  hours or more where there would be a pattern of dual or mixed lividity  and indeed that could be a lot longer than  hours.So basically based on the limited evidence of the autopsy report it appears that Haes body would have had to have been laid mostly face down from a time about  hours post mortem for an extended time...but the problem is that EP seems to gloss over or miss that initial period of no lividity or displaceable lividity.   See  gt Lividity often becomes perceptible within  h of death and progressively develops in surface area and colour intensity to attain its maximum degree  h postmortem. During this early period it is still mobile i.e. it may be locally displaced by thumb pressure on the skin or it can move partly or completelyto other regions of the corpse if the body position is altered. After  h postmortem hypostasis becomes fixed and thus can no longer be displaced by external action. It will then remain unchanged until masked by the generally darker discoloration resulting from putrefaction.gtAlthough this sign is present in almost all bodies with the exception of those dying of massive hemorrhage the time course of lividity exhibits considerable intersubject variability  probably to a greater extent than most other estimators of time of death in the early postmortem period. In addition its quantitative measurement is imprecise some authors use colorimetric tablesand in most routine cases its estimation remains largely subjective.I think EPs biggest error is simply that he is expecting precise answers from an inexact science. ,serialpodcast,cqbecj3,8,t5_33vph

But I agree that aside from the conference date and a cell phone log that is compatible with the witness statement there is no reason to favor any day over another.Here is the evidence that SS offers which suggests it was a different day which I had already compiled for another postCathy did not know the date of when Adnan was at her house until McGillvary told her in her March th interview. She testified that she had no independent recollection of her own of the date of Adnans visit..Neither Jay nor Jenn mention in their first interview going to Cathys that day. Jay doesnt mention them at all. Jay says McDonalds for police call.Jay says he was wearingtan jeans and a plaid coat. Cathy remembers a black coat and some kind of hat. She says she would have noticed if Jay had changed clothes in between visits.Cathy says Jay told her he and Adnan were going to go to a video store or maybe coming from one and then were going to meet Stephanie. No video store that day by any account and Stephanie would not be home from her away basketball game on the th until  pm. Adnan was at the mosque well before  pm.Jay referenced something about someone was going to pick them up at Cathys apartment. Obviously that doesnt make sense.Cathy says Adnan only received one phone call while there there are three in the time period and Cathy says it sounded like he was talking to a close friend the what do I do? call. But Jay says the one call was from Haes brother which means Adnan wouldnt be reacting like that.The exit was described differentlyJay says Adnan gets the police call as he was walking out the doorCahty says no call as she watched them leave.Jay and Cathy agree Adnan was acting weird the day he was at her houseslumped over and silent.

She led us to believe JAy was the only witness who testified. that is simply untrue. Jay admitted to lying then Cathy testified.  her testimony plus the cell records prove was telling the truth about them being together that night. Sk failed to mention that in Asias letter  she  talked about wanting to be in the FBI and how  much Asia interjected herself into the case. SK  failed to mention that Asia ASked  adnan in her letter  how come he didnt have any markings from the struggle? read  the closing arguments they clearly  show the Ms Murphy DID have evidence.  SK  just simply made a mockery of every piece. SK led us to believe that Syed NEVER had to think about jan  until six weeks later by his own account  is untrue.  He acknowledges the cops interviewing at his house prior to his arrest.  he also  acknowledges Adcock calling him on that day. SK failed to mention that  young lee testifed that   when he asked syed had he heard from Hae  Syed replied  Why dont you ask her BF SK  failed to mention that  Judge Wanda Heard  said  The evidence was overwhelming  Yes the lady who sat through the entire case  said that.  While SK is telling us  their is zero evidence of his guilt. PLz read the closing arguments make sure u read  Syed testimony at his appeal hearing. SK failed to mention at his appeal hearing  Syed is asked  a simple yes or no....  did u call HAe  ever ... after  being contacted by the police. and  he refused to answer  with a yes or no answer .plz read those things.  SK is bias.  SK NEEDS  Syed  to be as innocent if she would have  said ..Ya know ... i think he guilty and he got the right sentence.  well then  there would be nothing for us to discuss. look at the JINX He mistakenly confessed  and now look. there is nothing for us to discuss. no articles to be written nothing to investigate.  ,serialpodcast,cqoivcr,8,t5_33vph

Anybody have a link perchance?As far as Im aware Jay told Jenn according to Jenn to tell the cops to come talk to him. So its kinda voluntary but he didnt front up to the cops. He also waited until the cops had contacted Jenn and freaked her out.gtWith Jays now shifting timeline of when the burial took place does this void the cell tower pings at Leakin Park as evidence?Tricky question. It doesnt seem so from a legal perspective unless maybe team Adnan can get him a new trial and say Jay purjured himself. That seems very unlikely. Whether it changes peoples view of the Leakin Park pings as evidence well youve seen how things go here.gtAlso he now says he helped dig the hole for the body then went away and waited for Adnan to finish so how did he see him vomit?Good pick up. In one or maybe both of his police interviews Jay says Adnan vomits twice. The location and sequence shifts and IIRC the cops pull him up on it and he has another go. Jays shifting stories could be designed to hide the truth to obfuscate the cops to minimise his involvement or could be just because hes scared shamed traumatised by the experience or misremembering as everyone does.

3810637,0,t3_342898,I see your point and the only probability IMO where it could be legit would be........It could have been that Jay was just the middle man.  He could have sold for someone with far more criminal history.  I could see him getting fronted a certain amount and having to sell it.  Sure it would give him a small profit which would more than likely just be what he consumed.  But sometimes Ive seen this happen more than once it comes time to pay up your out of product and you havent quite sold or earned what you need to take to your supplier.  In the meantime you still want to get high so you need to find someone else to supply you a dime or a nickel ancient history here and there.

3857804,0,t1_cqvu20r,Really? Because the pm burial time now happened around midnight according to Jay. So theres that.Its been demonstrated time and time again that the police used the cell phone records to steer testimony. Therefore the time at which the these events supposedly occured are more or less meaningless. If the trunk pop never occurred after school and the body wasnt burieddumped around  pm then the cellphone record becomes totally meaningless not that it holds much water as it was used in court cell phone pings do not indicate specific areas which the phone must be in but rather a general area that allows connection with the cell tower. The tower chosen is not always the best available.So then the only pieces of evidence you have to pin this on adnan is the testimony of two witnesses who had their testimony manipulated by detectives to fit with the cellphone pings.,serialpodcast,cqw0wtw,1,t5_33vph
3857879,0,t1_cqvhse0,What does the comparison to Obamas mom have to do with this at all?  The sociocultural definition of being black in America is an inclusive one  I too have one white parent but realize that socioculturally I am black... That this may be rooted in racism one drop rule or is itself problematic is a different topic.... But Im also a geneticist... I realize that in a population genetics study I wont cluster with the majority of the AA population or the caucasian pop.  I understand by this definition my mixed heritage is relevant.  Same w obama. The same is true with the topic of immigration.  Immigrants were born elsewhere and came to the US.  Adnan didnt and thus he isnt an immigrant...Your trying to describe a sociocultural concept of immigration  that one who has the same cultural foreigness as an immigrant is practically an immigrant.  Thats fair.  I work with a Korean person whose mother came to the US when she was pregnant and returned to Korea after giving birth with her son.  He grew up in Korea and returned to the US as a naturalized citizen for college.  I can accept that he is practically an immigrant in spirit even if not by definition...However I reject your contention that Adnan fits the second category just as much as I reject your claim that children of immigrants are also immigrants...  From what I understand Adnan speaks only English fluently.  This is not indicative of the immigrant experience his parents experienced.  Sure he isnt leave it to beaver american but immigrants misleading... Tbh when we first heard the podcast my girl and I thought he was black...  dont think Id make that mistake w a Pakistani immigrant. ,serialpodcast,cqw17w2,6,t5_33vph

4001546,0,t1_crcdscm,Yeah its one of the best TAL episodes without doubt. Its got everything.I think  and Ive spoken about this before  that really when we talk about coaching we need to define what we mean by coaching.I dont find it credible that the police manipulated a false confession from Jay or that they framed Syed. I dont find it credible that this was the story the police came up with. Jenn Chris Tayyib Josh and Jeff  allegedly all people to whom Jay was telling some version of the story before he was on the police radar.But I think the point you raise about how police talk with a witness or a suspect etc and how that changes  perhaps not coaches coaches implies strategic  deliberate  focused improvement or development of something is very interesting.For exampleX Where were you between  on Wednesday?Y I was visiting my mother at a nursing home on the westsideX But your phone is pinging the eastside between Y Oh right. Yes now that you mention it im mixing up Wed and Thursday. Yeah I was at a bar on the east side.So we can make some assumptions from this thatA X had mixed up the days and was reminded by the pingsB X lied was caught in that lie and then proceeds to tell the truth or a new lie C X lied was caught in that lie and uses the knowledge that they need him to be east because of the pings to then tell the truth or a new lie.I believe all of A B and C are likely present in Jays police interviews at different points.

Unless of course there is a reason to wait on it until your attorney is dead.  uginabmonkey wrote gt you dont know Adnan is lying about asking about a plea Yes Ive been completely clear about that from the very beginning.  I think he probably perjured himself in his testimony about asking Gutierrez about a plea deal.  I dont claim to put it into the realm of  epistemological fact.  But the fact that we dont know for sure much about Adnan asking for a plea deal hurts his case not helps it.  The burden is on Adnan and his lawyer to prove that Adnan asked about a plea and then Gutierrez did nothing and lied about it.  So if they do nothing to prove this like subpoenaing Gutierrez legal team then this sure makes it look like theyre not presenting proof of Adnans claim because there is no proof of Adnans claim because the claim is not true.  And that as you must know is really the big difference between the Merzbacher  case and this one.  Merzbacher proved that Gutierrez did not act correctly by getting Gutierrez testimony.  Adnan has avoided Gutierrez testimony and avoided the testimony of Gutierrez legal team.  ,serialpodcast,cregnps,1,t5_33vph

4023484,1,t1_creqfqh,I have avoided writing on this subject because it seems like people either get the science and move past it or reject everything as a conspiracy and make strawmen that were not part of the trial record.  But you seem pretty levelheaded so I will give this a shot at a laymans level.You have a basic understanding but you are missing a critical piece  frequency reuse.  Spectrum rights in the cellular bands is extremely expensive and very limited in supply.  As such one of the most critical factors in cellular design is spectrum reuse which basically makes most networks capacity limited.  Thus the theoretical maximum transmit distance becomes almost meaningless as the bigger issue is limiting the geographic coverage of any single sector such that the signal from the sector does not overlap with a sector using the same frequency band.Using your very simplified model from above  lets say that ATampT has  MHz of spectrum MHz  MHz MHz  MHz and MHz  MHz  and they use  sectors BTS divided into sectors A B and C.  For traditional cell planning you would assume  channel to A MHz  MHz  channel to B MHz  MHz and  channel to C MHz  MHz.  As I said this is simplified to remove whitespace etc.The BTS are always oriented the same off of true North with pretty much the same orientation for every sector in every BTS  so sector A always covers a  degree arc from  degrees to  degrees.  As they are always pointed in the same direction and the frequency bands are different for the adjacent sectors on the same BTS you dont need to worry so much about overlap between sectors on the same BTS I will get into this next as far are functionality is concerned  but you can not have your B sector on one BTS transmit into the B sector on an adjacent BTS as they use the same frequency.  As such cellular planning specifically avoids this issue as the network simply will not work otherwise.  So the reports of towers  miles away being pinged in an urban environment are extremely extremely rare as the signal not only crosses over towers will stronger power based on distance but crosses over towers using the same spectrum channel.The long and short of it is that a cell transmit range is much smaller than the theoretical model by design.  So people like Michael Cherry simply do not know what they are talking about.  As for overlap between sectors  this is not an issue of will the phone work or not  but again  designed limitations to make the handoff of moving traffic between cells more reliable.  The biggest obstacle faced in cell planning is customer complaints over dropped calls.  If it is dropped due to fading etc while stationary there is not much that can be down.  However if it is due to movement between cells that can fixed by limiting transmit power so that poorly positioned BTS are not routed the call.So the long and short of that again is that a BTS sector is limited in its overlap with adjacent sectors by design as well.  So when AdnansCell writes about how a phone ping is very consistent with location within that cell it is  true.  This is what AW testified to in the trial.  No one says that is can prove he was at position X  but you can say the reverse if you are at position X you call will very very likely be transmitted by BTS sector Y. ,serialpodcast,crewodd,4,t5_33vph

4052415,0,t3_36vol3,I thought it might have happened at the Library and why ASCG did not pursue Asia more.  That perhaps Adnan did not want to be placed at the library at all.  But Best Buy makes a lot of sense in that it might be a place they were accustomed to going and parking.  I could see Adnan saying he wanted fifteen minutes of her time and after a year of dating that she should give him that and they went to their normal spot to be alone.  I think that area was considered a safe spot to do unsafe things in Adnans mind. But for some reason I think the library in her car.  Then maybe he drove to the best buy to move the body because he knew that was a safe place to do things.I know it sounds kind of strange but I dont feel I need to know the exact location of her demise or the exact time of her burial or what seat she was sitting in when it happened or where a trunk pop might have occurred.

4060524,0,t1_cridpum,Or you have to believe that Jay told Jenn roughly what to say to support his story. Nothing to do with the police coaching her during her interview I agree this is very unlikely  but the lack of possible coaching there might also account for the differences between what Jay and Jenn said. Theres pretty compelling evidence that Jay had already met with the police by then and knew they had phone records  you think he didnt speak to Jenn and run through what their story would be when she got formally interviewed?On the one hand the fact that Jenn and Jays stories dont match up entirely might make it less likely they colluded. Or it could just mean that they colluded but neither was spectacularly bright or had a great memory so they memorised a few things and had to kind of fudge the rest. Or that their stories originally kind of matched but the police massaged Jays so hard to fit their narrative that it stopped matching what Jenn remembered or what Jay told her to say.Again there is no evidence available other than Jay that Adnan and Jay were together at . and .. Jenn does not testify to that. In at least one of? her stories she places Adnan and Jay together at the mall an hour later noting that her story doesnt match Jays here. And she doesnt testify that they looked like theyd just been doing anything physical. Or that Adnan was acting weird.Something sort of like Jays story is possible but theres clearly a lot wrong with it and there are enough other possibilities that its not unreasonable to have doubts about it.,serialpodcast,crj4ok7,1,t5_33vph

It might even be a conversation worth having again. I dont know. It might be. Who am I to say it is not?

I didnt tell my friends how awful my ex partner was because they were his friends too and I thought that since it was an intimate relationship and not a platonic one he behaved differently in it wed been friends previously and there were no bad signs  it didnt have to color all his friendships.

4205611,0,t3_391kno,I am not really sure what you are trying to say here since its pretty clear Adnan a former student in the magnet program is no dummy. But re gtA semester of AP Psych helps a person understand what people might be looking for when trying to pinpoint a guilty person. Of course this doesnt make him guilty but it certainly fills the gaps of how a  yearold might know how and how not to act.I have taken multiple semester long courses on each of these topics and yet I am not some sort of master manipulator or great liar but very much a normal human being with emotions biases etc. Just because one understands what is going on in human beings or why something occurs does not mean you are not subject to being a human being or that you are some super human who can fool anyone around you.  So in other words a semester course in AP Psych does not do squat. An intro course to Psych barely scratches the surface of a large field creates minimal insight really and is also really not that difficult. I think anyone whos taken an intro to psych course in college can attest to that. ,serialpodcast,crzmnl3,8,t5_33vph

We pick the guy up tell him we found his DNA and he gives us nothing. Case goes nowhere.  Everyone Ive seen broken did so when confronted with stronger corroborating evidence.The fact that Jay gave him up was far and away the most likely thing to induce Adnan to talk. The reason they mention the red gloves is because they want to show that Jay actually talked  that theyre not just bluffing that he talked  by giving a random detail of his testimony. And the more random and obscure the detail the better because it hints that Jays statement to them was very detailed. Once they played that card and Adnan didnt talk the game was pretty much over. Most interrogations last only a few minutes if the guy doesnt want to talk  I wouldnt be surprised if Adnans was fifteen minutes or less the sixhour lie thats being thrown around is the product of trolling and deliberate ignorance.Think about it  if they actually have Jay hes going down and he did go down.  So whats the point in talking to the cops?  Most people who talk to the cops do so because they want to throw an accomplice under the bus and mitigate their own wrongdoing  they dont understand concepts like felony murder and acting in concert and think that theyre helping themselves.  Or they want to raise an affirmative defense right away  yes I was in the building but my uncle lives on the fourth floor and I was going to see him etc. in the hopes that theyll be let go.  Adnan cant do either of those two things without lying.  So he says nothing.EDIT  And as a somewhat unrelated aside  he may be a kid but hes  not  not  not .  Hes almost an adult and hes an honors student.  Im continually impressed by the cognitive dissonance some people not you but others exercise when explaining away Adnans statements and actions as oh he just didnt understand the question or he didnt know how to react when by all accounts he was a smart kid.

That tends to support the dump amp return theory as does the general circumstances.  If Adnan had Haes body in the trunk he would have logically have been in a huge hurry to dispose of both the body and the car after getting the call from Adcock.   I dont see him wanting to leave Haes car parked by the side of the road for very long while he was engaged in digging  it simply makes more sense to quickly hide the body then hide the hot car somewhere else  and then come back later and park somewhat farther from the grave site to reduce the chances of being caught.,serialpodcast,csb4rsz,18,t5_33vph

4388827,0,t3_3b95s3,Without Jay there is literally zero evidence to make a case at trial.  The only suspicious points and not all these are admissible at trial would be.  Adnan told people Hae had wanted to get back with him.  However this is consistent with various innocent explanations i wishful thinking ii high school student being boastful iii someone worried that he might be a suspect iv someone trying to  make themselves the centre of attention in the huge story that a classmate was murdered..  The I will kill note.  This is consistent with someone with a clear conscience who did not think he needed to get rid of incriminating evidence. Why would a guilty Adnan not destroy that paper and all other evidence that he might locate after an exhaustive search in the days after he had spontaneously killed Hae or in the days before he premeditatedly did so.. Calling Jay pathetic.  Not inconsistent with innocence and knowing Jay was lying..  Not giving evidence at trial.  Suspicious in my opinion but not inconsistent with a client following attorneys advice especially one who was a drug user and who was uncertain about his exact whereabouts at crucial times..  Wanting a plea deal.  Very suspicious in my opinion.  But the exact details are murky.  Him simply asking CG to find out what was on the table would be fairly rational  ie I might do that even if innocent.  But if he actually told CG that he wanted her to try to negotiate a deal then I find that suspicious.  ie if I was innocent I would not think that the prosecution had such a strong case that I had no choice but to plead.,serialpodcast,cskcvar,1,t5_33vph

4430080,1,t1_csp2ivr,The allegation was that the investigators racialethnic bias and Islamophobia caused them to specifically target Adnan during the missing persons investigation and that this document would back the allegation. Are you arguing that the investigators shouldnt have included the descriptor black female because it suggests bias against African Americans? or that they should have included white male for Don?         My main point is that Adnan and Don were the two of the suspects for Haes disappearance at the missing person stage as her current and former boyfriends. It looks like Haes father was also a potential suspect. The fact that they mentioned Adnans religion and ethnicity and not Dons makes sense  the ethnic and religious differences between the Korean community and Adnans community was a recurring theme from the witnesses interviews from Haes diary as well as Haes and Adnans family.

In Jays first interview he states that when he was digging the grave HMLs body was beside them.That still does not match the lividity and livor mortis evidence.  Haes body would have had to have been laid flat immediately after her murder and left for  hours or so.  After  hours she would have been buried.  She couldnt have been dumped at the Leakin Park burial location because there was a slight hill that would have caused the blood to pool differently.  She couldnt have been in a car because she had to be laid flat.  None of Jays interviews and testimonies accurately explain the evidence.  gtThe police work was not shoddy thats an overstatement.

Trainum and I have the same concerns However what were unsure of is what happened to change Jays story from A to B and we do not know what happened in the interrogating those three hours and that will always result in a question as to what the final outcome should have been. Trainum.  I think its clear Jay changed his stories to say what the investigators wanted to hear.

In fact he understood it and the religious issues.I notice that many of the posters who obsess that he is guilty sound very angry towards men in general or perhaps towards Muslims.  Many admit that they have been in abusive relationships.  They dont need evidence the fact that Adnan is male or Muslim and male is enough.

He was saying that based on the autopsy report he thought it was more likely that Hae was in the driver seat when she was attacked by someone in the passenger seat. Here are more excerpts from his interview for more information I apologize for being graphic gtBM I dont think that there was a rope involved here. And normally when you have a fracture involving the hyoid bone youre using hands and fingers to dig in deep and fracture the bone. I felt convinced that she was actually sitting in her car and was assaulted by someone in the passenger side. She was beaten around the head and then the person could have been right handed grabbed her throat strangled her so hard that it fractured the hyoid on the left side.And re hard flat surface Dr. Manion seemed to think the head injuries were caused by a fist gtRC Do you think the head blows were consistent with were they severe enough that it seemed like something was used to hit her and not simply a fist?gtBM Could be with a fist. Could be with a fist. Theres no skull fracture. Theres no all the injuries are underneath the scalp. Theres no injury to the brain. Theres no subdural hematoma subarachnoid hemorrhage no skull fracture. So more like a fist a soft object could cause that.And since Dr. Manion thinks the head injuries were likely caused by a fist hes arguing that the location of those injuries on the right side of the head would be more consistent with an attack from the side such as in a car than with a frontal attack gtBM If Im attacking somebody Im righthanded Im going to use my right fist.

He didnt help dig the grave he did help dig the grave. The burial was around  PM the burial was around midnight. He went specifically to check to see if Haes car was still there he just happened to be in the area and noticed Haes car was still there.To me this is the spine of story and he has given contradictory statements on each thing that happened.

4560918,0,t1_ct5cs5w,Perhaps I worded my sentiments poorly. I am not okay with innocent people being convicted but Im also not unrealistic. As long as fallible human beings are in charge of assessing guilt or innocence there will be wrongful convictions. Given that reality minimizing the margin of error minimizing the damage done if and when it happens and providing opportunities for convicts to realistically stand a chance of having their case reexamined are all important. As much as Id like to completely eliminate wrongful convictions I do not know of a means of doing that. If you do Im all ears.The reason I write so extensively about this is because I believe much of the  philosophy is the result of people being extremely mistrustful of the current system. Everything from police misconduct to unreliable witness testimony to lack of accountability cause people such as myself to feel uncomfortable declaring anyone but the most obvious perpetrators guilty. Knowing the kind of situation they would end up in and the impact it would have if I make a mistake leaves me feeling crippled. I could never serve on a jury.

4585397,0,t1_ct8kmwc,gt because my friends just dont care.Yep a lot of us found that!!Try these to be getting on withgtHere is the simplest answer The Serial Podcast framed Jays story from the outset as a lie you heard Jays story through the lens of the podcast not as it was presented at trial. Jay testified for  days at Adnans trial   of them were through exhaustive unrelenting and often repetitive crossexamination by Adnans attorney during which he was confronted with every inconsistency in his story. So the jury knew everything that podcast listeners knew and more  they saw him sitting in a court room with them answering the questions that were put to him and they believed him. The podcast didnt tell you everything it omitted mention of much of the evidence introduced against Adnan that bolstered the prosecutions case or tended to confirm Jay. Many of us were sympathetic to Adnan until we started to read the actual trial documents. Basically the story you got from the podcast is not the same as what the jury saw and heard. Since you say you are new I think a good starting point would be to read the prosecutions closing argument at trial. Heres a link to the transcript  This is the argument not the evidence but it will give you a a good picture of how the prosecution saw the case and how it was presented to the jury. It wasnt just Jays story it was Jays story as confirmed by other witnesses in particular Jenn and Cathy together with cell phone records that confirmed the sequence and location of calls from the time that a police officer called Adnan looking for Hae.

If you are going to ignore all the facts and details when determining plausibility you are just going with your own prejudice about what is more likely or not.  I agree when a person attributes a probability to something happening randomly that is subjective.  But some occurrences can be measured objectively with statisticssuch as the number of teenage boys that kill their exes.  I dont think theyve actually broken it down that far but if you look deeply into the murder statistics that exist you will find it is an extremely rare occurrencemore than thirdparty killers or even serial killers.I disagree that the jury had more information than we dowe know a lot more than they did about this case and the evidence if you dont want to bother to look into the details that is up to you but the better informed about them one is the greater the likelihood of an accurate estimate of probability.,serialpodcast,ctbvqhg,1,t5_33vph

This isnt one of them. Jay is direct evidence you just dont happen to like it. Plain honest men seem to think because evidence can be questioned or doubted then its meaningless as evidence. Thats not true anywhere. Despite the lies gaps and inconsistencies in Jays testimony I think the parts that identify Adnan as the murderer are strongly corroborated by a ton of circumatantial evidence enough to make me think Adnan likely did it.

We also want to believe in the bad seed the child who was born that way and couldnt be stopped no matter how devoted and wonderful his parents were.Undoubtedly this is true in cases of extreme mental illness like psychosis but apart from that there just arent people who were born bad running around and killing people.You can see this by looking at any famous killers background. There isnt one that Im aware of that didnt have an extremely problematic upbringing.Where is this psychopath from a good family that were all so convinced exists?Now of course this doesnt mean that everyone from a crappy family ends up a killer. Obviously theres a spectrum and some people escape and others can never conquer the demons but statistics and science make it very clear that the best way to become a murderer is to grow up in a dysfunctional home.And yet for some reason at this point in time we really want to deny this.gtIs there an example that influenced your belief there? Or have you read a study that concludes its primarily nurture?In general Im highly sceptical of the idea that mental illness is due to chemical imbalances and that mental problems are caused by nature. As this article points out the whole chemical imbalance thing is primarily a North American idea not widely accepted in EuropeNow again and in good faith from where do you get the idea that psychopaths are born not made? Because Ive never seen a study that says that either.I think the studies in this field would tend more to support a genetic basis for depression or schizophrenia.And finally the other thing that I dont fully understand is why people get so angry discussing this topic which is not in any way meant to imply that you are angry. ,serialpodcast,ctm6b8g,2,t5_33vph

Haes brother confirmed that it was the turn signal that was broken and that was and always has been on the lefthand side of the column in the Nissan Sentra.  In what possible scenario could her foot have broken that lever in a struggle with bucket seats and a middle console and Adnan having to basically be on top of her to have a grip around her neck?Just one more detail that refutes the States theory that people like your favorite poster minimize or dismiss due to obvious bias.

On the other hand I agree with AnnB that it seems really unlikely that neither side in this case attempted to get incoming caller information if it was readily obtainable so that makes me think it wasnt as simple as Undisclosed is portraying it.  Cherrys opinion means nothing to me hes a joke but I have a little more confidence in Levitan so according to him they were obtainable if requested.But even if you can understand why the state wouldnt want them bad evidence or whatever why wouldnt CG?

4926761,0,t1_cufiz0h,Well to start with its clearly written by a prosecutor. Their perspective on the world generally speaking is that because the defendant is guilty exculpatory information is a rare and surprising thing much like a unicorn. Defense attorneys in contrast believe that all information is exculpatory. The prosecutors are the ones who control the information and decide what gets turned over the defense often being unaware of its existence.So in some offices not a lot of stuff gets turned over. Other offices embrace an open file policy where the defense is given almost everything.So this looks like the prosecutor is embracing the minimal constitutional requirements approach which isnt surprising since the safety of informants is involved.The risk there is that this may lead to violating the rights of defendants. I can think of many examples where information that doesnt point to another person is exculpatory. But hey what the defense is never made aware of they cant litigate!,serialpodcast,cufk2gt,8,t5_33vph

Maybe it was the same person who had called CrimesStoppers maybe it was someone different they would have no way of knowing the calls were anonymous.

4978092,0,t3_3j3mtl,Its interesting you bring this up because I was thinking the same thing recently except for the anyone but Adnan crowd. Ive noticed a marked desperation in their posts much more focus on personal attacks as well as the recent holding up the Serial Dynasty host as some sort of champion fighting the good fight on their behalf. Weak arguments and embracing truly absurd theories all in the name of freeing the murderer.I didnt really comment on it because I felt it was rude and pointless to bring up since what is there to be done to help them with the process? Its not like our sub can bring in counselors to help them deal with the realization that Adnans cause is a losing one or the even harder to stomach realization it should be a losing one since he strangled the life out of Hae Min Lee and buried her in a shallow grave. I imagine for people who have dedicated months coming up on a year to their belief in Adnan coming to terms with that is a similar stress level of finding out a SO is cheating on you and has been the entire time you were in love. Many seem to be in the denial stage but some are transitioning to anger but anger at guilters if it wasnt for the guilters Adnan would be a free man right?The rightfully convicted crowd doesnt have the same level of anger and bitterness as some in the anyone but adnan movement because justice has been done and will probably continue to be done. When I see people saying they have listened to Serial a dozen times and Undisclosed over and over trying to figure out the hidden way that Adnan is innocent and Jay isisnt responsible whichever is better for Adnan I dont feel anger. I feel sad they are wasting their life trying to help a murderer. I feel sorry for Rabia she has wasted so many years so many hours upon hours upon hours trying to free her brothers friend she has no real reason to think is innocent except the case was weak against him. I dont blame anyone for liking Adnan or thinking he isnt the sort of guy they can picture killing a person. I was in the same boat at first I can relate to that feeling of not wanting Adnan to be guilty of thinking there must be more to the story there must be something that everyone overlooked that will free this man and if only I can find the needle in the haystack the truth will come out. But the truth is not every haystack has a needle.

I kept waiting to hear something new and legally significant but it never came. Once they posted documents online at the Serial site and I became aware of the  call  I realize that the whole framing of the issue as being about  minutes was simply journalistic sleight of hand. It made for a good story but any lawyer or judge would see right away that an alibi would need to cover the time period through . or at least very close to .   Theres way more because the more that I learned about the case the more I could see how weak and speculative the various claims advanced on Adnans behalf were.

5028825,0,t1_cus5kab,most everyone agrees it was possible for the DNA to have been tested at the time of the crime. The main defense for why it wasnt by the state is something like it was too expensive to be done  wasnt standard  only in exceptional cases. Im citing that it seems suspicious the case was special enough to require use of cell phone records but not give the same credence to the DNA. If you believe the police story the investigation was still open upon the finding of her body  they had sufficient cause to look for DNA matches given the fact they had no witness testimony linking Adnan to the crime at the time hadnt yet spoken to Jay etc. If there is one case where you might need to go the extra step in finding that DNA match maybe its the one that seems like a rape without any true suspects aside from a guy mentioned in an anonymous phone call?Please do not confuse my interpretation with a misunderstanding of science. I understand it was difficult to test DNA then and understand why it wasnt tested. However the same logic as applied to Adnan he hasnt tested it  guilty can be easily shifted to cast doubt on the prosecution. Of course the prosecution had legitimate reasons not to test  but the defense does as well. ,serialpodcast,cus5y9q,-5,t5_33vph

5032020,0,t3_3jtr57,Question if Dons alibi on time cards was so obviously faked so that reddits forensic geniuses have cracked the case  years later why take the extraordinary steps to pursue and maybe frame Adnan based on concocted testimony from a known area drug dealer?  Especially since there wasnt much provable showing that Adnans alibi was false? In that it seems he did go to school and track which complicated his case a little bit. The only way to make a persuasive case against Don instead of connecting dots from an incompletely disclosed case file is to have Undisclosed actually disclose everything the police used to conclude he wasnt a suspect with sensitivity of course for his privacy. They didnt just look at time cards and call it a day. Everyone knows that time cards can be monkeyed with and the police are well aware that defense attorneys target this type of manipulable information to derail cases against the main suspect.What makes Undisclosed and Serial Dynastys socalled investigation against Don so dishonest is that theyre raising all these doubts and suspicions without disclosing all the information the police used to rule him out. Its ethically reprehensible to do this to a real live law abiding person who now has to deal with Google searches connecting his name to a murder for the rest of his life. Given the gravity of the damage Be forthright. Be honest. Its of a different nature than hiding info that makes Adnan look guilty  here youre dragging Don through the mud without disclosing what the investigation already used to conclude he was innocent. Its borderline Stalinist.,serialpodcast,cusjsvy,15,t5_33vph
5033579,0,t1_cusguma,Id add that the fact that a helpful DNA result is one of the very few specific circumstances that Maryland law recognizes as grounds to reopen a PCR hearing makes it doubly hard for me to understand a decision to delay the testing at the current time when COSA specifically remanded Adnans case to allow motion to reopen.On Serial Deirdre seemed confident that an order for DNA testing could be obtained within a matter of months.  I can see why Justin Brown might have wanted to hold off when the case was pending in COSA  why complicate things when there is a potential of a favorable court ruling in the short term?But for me the day that COSA remanded to the trial court was an opportunity to move on the DNA testing.   Brown could have filed his motion to reopen on the Asia claim while simultaneously pursuing the DNA order knowing that a favorable DNA result would almost certainly guarantee a reopened PCR hearing.   As it is it is unlikely that there will be a ruling on the current motion to reopen until October or November  unless there is a summary denial without hearing. At least in theory the DNA results could have been ready  by the time a hearing on the motion to reopen was scheduled.  ,serialpodcast,cusqk7j,3,t5_33vph

Your source on the lividity evidence is someone who hasnt examined the photographs supported by textbooks and others with medical degrees.I never said I have never listened to Undisclosed or read what was posted. I said I will not continue to do so after events of the past few weeks. I listened to that exact episode of Undisclosed on livor I am simply not going back there to pull a direct quote which is why I am asking to link a direct quote that counters what I posted. gt Im going to stick with the opinion of a person who has examined the photographs who has decades of experience as a medical examiner who has read the autopsy report who has read the testimony of the person who did the autopsy. Again all you have to do is link the exact quote and we can discuss it if calm discussion is indeed your actual intent. I am pretty certain that nothing the actual ME said in that episode disputed anything Lipid posted so I would like to see exactly what was said that you claim counters what I quoted. gt We cant definitively conclude that the gravesite wasnt visited multiple times! What she doesnt say is that we have to conclude that it was in order for the observed lividity to make any sense at all. This is backwards reasoning.Not sure why you think that is backwards reasoning. The point is the livor information really says nothing as to factual guilt or innocence. Thats my point.If all you are trying to use the livor for is to disrupt the States timeline then I am not sure what the point is because you dont even need the livor for that see Serial.

5200317,0,t3_3m73y7,From memory alone so please excuse errors.        Young American soldier possibly on second tour of duty. In Afghanistan.      One night while on guard duty alone at his post BB set down his firearm and walked into the darkness. He said nothing to anyone about what he was doing.       His unit has long maintained that he simply walked off his post for no reason and simply deserted his duty.      BB was captured by Talibanallied fighters and kept in captivity for years. His parents campaigned to the US State Dept to get him ransomed or rescued. At least  US soldiers died on various missions trying to find and save BB over the years.      BBs dad learned either Urdu or Pashto and basically tried to become an expert in local languages and culture to try and negotiate his childs release. BBs parents are kind of amazing and strange.      BB had a pacifist sort of upbringing. Its not clear to me why he wanted to enlist and fight because I am pretty sure we were already at war when he did so its not like deployment came as a surprise to him.       Some people say that BB was upset with how American andor allied forces conducted themselves visavis how local civilians were treated. He apparently protested against civilian casualties. This is unclear. I dont know how we now this or if this is true.       About a year ago Obama gave permission for the State Dept to negotiate BBs release trading him for  Guantanamo captives who were turned over to Yemen and were supposed to be prevented from returning to the battlefield. Many criticized Obama for loosing  terrorists just to get back a traitor meaning they claimed Obama had let go  people who would take the lives of American and allied soldiers to get back someone who was a traitor. However Obama claimed that no US soldier could be left behind at any time and that this was the pact we made with our soldiersthat we would always come for them no matter what.       BB was weak and ill when rescued and flown to Germany to a US base there. He spent weeks recovering there before being flown to the US where he spent months more recovering before he was charged with being a traitor basically.       BB claims he lived with very religious people who did not mistreat him I think he claimed that. I think he almost never spoke English while he was a captive.       No one really knows what happened the night he walked off base.      No one really knows what was going on within his unit.       No one really knows what his life was like in Afghanistan.      No one really knows if BB was depressedtrying to kill himself if he had moral or religious convictions against the US mission in Afghanistan if he has a mental illness etc.      No one really knows if he was a coward who did not want to fight or if he was incredibly brave to throw himself into his enemys hands for moral reasons.      The men in his unit mostly seem to despise him and think he is a traitor.

Ill leave my errors as is and someone else can correct them ,serialpodcast,cvctxu4,7,t5_33vph

5207160,1,t1_cvdm5mp,I like your version because it really focuses in on just that piece of evidence standing alone without the noise from everything else.OK  so along those lines  Adnan asked Hae for a ride.  Standing alone what does this mean knowing she was murdered but excluding Jays story of why he asked.youre right that no one seeing him get a ride isnt proof of him not asking for one.  Reading that thread there is certainly a lot of information that points to him asking for one.  Especially the fact that he told Adcock he did the first time they spoke and then backtracked and said it didnt happen.  Given the parameters of only considering this piece of information that he most likely did ask for a ride but then backtracked... I will add him asking for a ride to my facts list.  This is exactly what I was hoping would happen  I need to really understand howwhy people use certain things to convince them of guilt.  And to think it out and try to disprove it and then be unable to do so helps me see that.  Thank you.  Do you have any others??,serialpodcast,cvdnl62,-1,t5_33vph

I doubt were going to resolve it.In the general case youre simply wrong about the law and I hope you can understand that.  That doesnt mean youre wrong about the outcome of this particular case. But you believe that Adnan was convicted specifically of a murder that occurred before  or if you believe that the States argument about a possible later murder is somehow barred as a legal matter those are simply false beliefs.   Whether the evidence at hand passes the reasonable doubt test is something we disagree about.  Thats fine.

5216217,0,t1_cveprrj,Well I agree with you about the status quo and the establishment there was an incredibly powerful and upsetting This American Life episode which showcased stories of people whose lives had been ruined by a very harsh antidrug judge Very Tough Love episode  that made me cry from frustration. I agree with a sensible suspicion of organisations  Im just not sure whether in this investigation and trial I get a strong sense of corruption or bias in particular though reading through what I could. Is it a moral responsibility to question your belief in something because someone else feels differently? Good question. I think its always good to examine deeply and rigorously what you believe and question your own motivations. Ive lacked confidence in my own opinions most of my life but Ive come to realise that other people often dont have it worked out. You have to work it out for yourself I think and be content with that. If you strongly believe something live that uncompromisingly! Unless it hurts people. Then dontThanks for sharing the story of your friends dad which certainly highlights the complexity of human morality. Yet I maintain there is only one objective truth. There are no levels or ambiguities to reality. Someone killed Hae. I feel there are enough crucial elements mapped out to infer that an alternative suspect is practically impossible in this case. This does not mean we can work out the exact progression of Haes death and burial in high definition detail. And this is not necessary either. What it means is that a series of logical deductions are highly suggestible of Adnans involvement.Does that mean we fully grasp the motives behind the act? No but people are interested and they are going to speculate I think. For many this is a human interest story.,serialpodcast,cveqw2f,3,t5_33vph

Its certainly possible that thats what this is but I dont see enough evidence to support that speculation unless you think that because Adnan killed Hae that thats evidence enough for this to be something odd.. It seems like people are prodding bits and pieces to conform to their idea that Adnan is some sicko to further justify their belief that he is guilty when thats not necessary. Also to further tear down the original presentation of Adnan by Serial which obviously was not the full picture. However it does seem like some people are overcompensating and starting to read too far into things.Its still possible that Adnan killed Hae and that this is just a spot where he put stuff he cared about. It doesnt mean its something more nefarious than that.

Anyway Quarles says he knows Christina to be a pitbull on the pant leg of justice but an otherwise courteous person and about everybody just behaves themselves ok?

Its the ATampT call records from Adnans phone showing calls from January   and . Christina says she hasnt seen it before. Urick says thats not true she has theyd already stipulated to the call record. She says yeah but I hadnt actually looked at it before I havent physically seen this exhibit. Quarles calls them up to the bench. Miss Gutierrez he says if youre going to stand there and lie to the jury about something that you agreed could come in Im not going to permit you to do that. Christina says Judge the fact that I agreed But he cuts her off. That was a lie. You told a lie. Im not going to permit you to do that. Thats not a lie Judge I resent the implication. Christina starts getting heated now. Quarles says Please be quiet please be quiet. She says Its very hard to be quiet when a court is accusing me of lying.I dont want to overdo it here but its possible that had this bench conference not happened Adnans whole life could have been different. That first trial according to Adnan to Christinas colleagues to people who were watching it seemed to be going well for Adnans side. It was moving fast and Jay seemed to be more on the defensive and then this happened. Of course jurors overheard it despite the white noise they turn on during bench conferences to muffle the sound. After a break Christina asks for a mistrial. Quarles says hes gotten a note from Alternate Number . In view of the fact that youve determined that Miss Gutierrez is a liar will she be removed?

The prosecution demonstrated with AWs testing that the burial location was within the coverage area of LB and Urick did a good job with his map exhibit of portraying this like it was GPS accurate even though he never actually lied to the jury. CG should have retained her own expert and demonstrated what other locations were covered by LB and demonstrate overlapping coverage areas which would ensure that the jury understands the fickleness and limitations of relying on cell tower data for location.I think the reality is that CG didnt really understand the cell evidence herself.

So if the cops wanted to see if Jay got paid to help commit murder they talk to a guy selling a motorcycle and see if Jay and he discussed it. Im sort of on board up to this point.

And maybe its not you per se but this at least the th time someone has come armed with a random website or white paper or textbooks convinced AW and the rest of the industry is full of it and trying to pull the wool over their eyes. And its somehow a great conspiracy that these technologies are actually really simple and engineered to work in a specific way. Yet the edge case that you can sit equidistant from a couple of towers and change connection based on small factors blows their mind and convinces them nothing can be known...When in fact for . of the cases its rudimentary to predict the antenna that will be used at a given location. And applying these rudimentary methods to the existing calls to show that  of the time it works for the call data we have is unconvincing. The naivety and bravado that a single white paper is the holy grail of cell technology and trumps the decades of research and work done in the field used to be funny now its just getting old thats all.I guess dont take it personally uHalbarad but consider the depth of knowledge applied and that the surface findings of a white paper likely arent the whole story and arent going to bust open real research and productization or diminish the expert testimony and findings in this case.,serialpodcast,cwk62kp,0,t5_33vph

And because Hae always called Adnan baby the I miss you baby might refer to him and coupled with the phone number could imply that Hae was conflicted and missing Adnan. Do I have that right?But if this is really a picture of the  Dons page of the diary it seems like a virtually impossible contention.The I miss you baby seems pretty clearly to be a part of all the Dons and written at the same time. It looks almost like the closing of a letter with all the Dons as the body and I miss you baby as closing or final line. ,serialpodcast,cwl8ivz,19,t5_33vph

5573155,0,t1_cwnv0oa,You are claiming there is overwhelming evidence when there is in fact effectively one piece of evidence.  We can quibble over the specifics of that piece of evidence but it is in no way overwhelming because as I pointed out if you remove Jay there is literally no case.  There is as much a case against Don as their is against Adnan if you remove Jay.Overwhelming evidence would suggest that there is so much that there is no way that you can come to any other reasonable conclusion and that simply isnt true here.As for why would Jay lie?  Take a look at one of about a billion offered theories online.  He lied because the police intimidated him into telling a fabricated story.  He lied for reward money.  He lied to protect the real killer whom he knew.  The entire case hinges on the testimony of Jay and we cannot trust Jay to be telling the truth.  His story isnt consistent with the states timeline of the case.  It isnt consistent with his previous stories with medical evidence with the cellular log in many places and so forth.  The odds are shitty Ill agree but people who are wrongfully convicted are pretty unlucky in general.  If youre lucky the police arent going to find incorrect evidence and make the wrong leaps of logic that put you in jail. Look at the case of Ricky Jackson.  He was convicted at  of murder because of the testimony of a  year old with no reason to lie.  Except that  years later it turned out that the  year old did in fact lie because the police threatened to put his parents in jail. Is it so hard to believe that maybe the police sat Jay down in the hours before they recorded and said Look Adnan did this and that you helped him.  If you dont want to go to jail or get the death penalty then cooperate and tell the story were putting in front of you.  If anything I find that actually more likely than the idea that Jay had seven different trunk pop locations couldnt remember the tools used to bury the body imagined entire hour long detours that couldnt have possibly happened.People shit all over Adnan for not remembering what he claims was a perfectly normal day but you never seem to bat an eye when Jay switches the location of the murder from a park to best buy.  Or when they take an hour long trip to said state park where schrodingers murder occurred I guess only for that to disappear when the call log shows its not humanly possible.If I was driving around with someone I just knew had murdered another person Id probably remember that day pretty damn clearly.

For example my big question was how did Jay know where the car was? Serial didnt mention at all that people thought the cops may have fed Jay that info. Serial also didnt mention that the cops in Adnans case have been involved in other cases of wrongful conviction and witness coercion  cases where people were freed after years in prison because of these very same cops doing some shady stuff.

Jay initially said to try Don. That indicates that Jay was full of crap and knows nothing about the murder. Of course someone could argue that was before Jay decided to turn on Adnan and that Jay was once again lying but then the question becomes why? What happens after this to get Jay to rat out Adnan? Jay first says to check out Don and while hes still with the police Jay confesses to helping bury a body. Between these two events Jay doesnt see Adnan so its not like Adnan scared or threatened him. If Jay confessed because he was scared it seems like the cops were the only people he had contact with who could have put that fear into him. For me if nothing else it puts to rest the idea of Adnan or someone else menacing Jay once and for all. Edit check out normaldays link below. Im not sure Bob interpreted this one correctly.

There is none without eliminatingaltering large parts of the accusers testimony. Therefore it is very very unlikely that Adnan is the killer unless he did it without Jays knowledge also higly improbable.  The willingness of the guilters to dismiss the impossibilities in Jays stories is stunning.The cell pings as evidence of guilt on the other hand can be easily dismissed as I feel quite confident will be confirmed by AW at the hearing.Edited to remove erroneous not .,serialpodcast,cww8rwh,2,t5_33vph

5649360,0,t1_cwx3e6g,Your point makes sense. But youre missing something here. For example when you say The point is that these things are suspect only if Im guilty Thats not true the terms suspect and guilt are two totally different things. And in your argument youre using them as if there fluidly interchangeable. Ill put it like this I can be suspicious or act suspicious and be innocent or I could be guilty. So when youre a suspect of a crime that doesnt make you guilty it simply means that suspicion has been cast upon your involvementrole in that crime in a way which requires further investigation. Therefore it is very possible for the note to look suspicious without an acknowledgement of innocence or guilt. Any parent or teach who deal with teenage kids can tell you that there are times where they may read or hear something from the child that seems suspicious whether relating to a crime suicide or maybe just normal teenage shenanigans.So lets say you buy that shovel and flashlight prior to the murder of your friendspouse murder yes that would come into question as far as intent of the purchase. Especially if the body was burried. Meaning if you live on the third floor of your apartment complex the shovel would appear to be a little strange. Shouldnt suspicion be placed on such an item where there seems to be no real need for it? Would it be safe to say that maybe you were planning to use for something other than your home gardening project? Would it then be fair to ask what you were planning to use it for? My point with the note is that you should not look at that  and go Adnan is guilty absolutely not! But because Adnan is a suspect meaning POTENTIALLY guilty its not something to be ignored either.  You talk a lot about real evidence. Im not really sure what  all you contribute to being  real evidence. Are fingerprints real evidence? Are a witness testimony evidence? DNA? Clothing Fabric? Would those be considered real evidence? Because all of those except for witness testimony do not directly point to guilt of murder. If they found Adnans fingerprints all over Haes car that doesnt tell us that he killed her it simply establishes presence in her car. Similar thing with DNA or clothing fabric it simply puts the person at the scene of a crime to make sure that theyre not chasing waterfalls. Almost all evidence can be subjective. And all evidence is but a piece to a much larger body of work called a case. So no piece of evidence can stand on its own. You point out Jays testimony and cell phone records being enough but think about how many people on the Serial subreddit alone questions Jays testimony. Cell phone pingslike the evidence I listed earlier only establishes location its simply a piece to the case against Adnan. It does not tell you that he killed Hae but it doesnt make it invalid or unuseful. I am leaning toward the concept that he is guilty because of all of the things that are being used against him that  he currently doesnt have an answer for. Now I agree that not all evidence should not be allowed and there is a process in the legal system that all evidence used in the trial has to go through in order to be considered valid. And yes sometimes the prosecution does twist and bend too much just to get a conviction. But there are just as many defense lawyers who will come up with any argument and excuse  to win a case as well notice how many mentally ill people have gone through the system in the past decade and a half.  ,serialpodcast,cwxcwfb,1,t5_33vph

If Aisha or Haes family shared the number with the police I dont see any note of it. It doesnt appear in the Enehey Group report either and it doesnt seem like Hae was paying for a pager at least via her bank account.gtI cant see why its a problem for him to call her at homeBecause he had known her less than three months had been dating her for less than two weeks and didnt have anything to contribute regarding her whereabouts. For all we know Don didnt even know Haes family knew of his existence at that time. We do know that Haes family made contact with Don at his workplace a day or two after her disappearance though.Remember Don barely knew Hae. We dont have any indication that they really ever interacted outside of work until January st. He couldnt have had any idea if Hae was in the habit of running off or breaking dates or dodging responsibilities. For someone familiar with her like Adnan was going missing should have been a cause for concern but as far as Don knew Hae may have just been odd and flaky. If some girl I had only gone out on a few dates with skipped work and stood me up I wouldnt immediately think she had been a victim of a crime instead Id assume she was a weirdo.gtIf I had been contacted by the police or a family member of someone whod gone missingAll he knew was what Lenscrafters told him.

He may have surmised at that point that they had spoken with his coaches and that it was a good thing he had engaged in memorable conversation with Coach Sye that day.gtAccording to your theory the detectives dont even know about Adnans conversation with Sye on March th so isnt it odd that Jay randomly volunteers this information without prompting on March th after failing to do so in the previous two interviews?Or it could have been something that just slipped his mind during the first two interviews.

5871977,0,t1_cxp8i8x,The short answer is between calls its on the order of seconds. There are a couple systems at play. How often the network wants an update and how often the phone is updating. The phone will be updating its signal strength to display to the user more often than it is updating the network. There can be a timeout for updating the network every  seconds every  seconds. There can also be a push method where the phone updates when it detects a new antenna is the stronger signal. This drains power on the phone though especially when the phone is on the edge of two towers. The phone also shouldnt spam the network with updates.Im not sure that answers your question but its dependent on a lot of factors many of those configurable per network and phone.

Number one is that I cant keep this up forever. My fulltime job at the fire department eats up a lot of my time. And for the last seven months every single evening and weekend has been spent with a laptop on my lap either on the couch or laying in bed with my wife working on researching and preparing for this show. Ive dedicated  years of my life to the fire service and I dont regret one minute of it. It has been an amazing and fulfilling career. Ive had the opportunity to affect thousands of lives over these years and have made lifelong bonds with some great friends that will be forever in my life.gt But I believe its time for me to move on with my next mission. I believe that this podcast... I believe that all of us together can make a difference and continue to affect thousands of lives by challenging our broken legal system in fighting for those who can no longer fight for themselves who may be sitting behind bars wrongfully convicted. And Ive decided that its time for me to get into that fight fulltime.gt Like I said this was not an easy decision to make. But I spent a lot of time praying about this and I have absolute peace that this is the direction that Im supposed to go.

6101051,0,t1_cyiwftt,I actually think theres a very good chance hell never have to reply. Adnans appeal is based on technicalities not on any grounds for exoneration. If he is unsuccessful then his legal team will apply to test the DNA. There only real hope is that it comes up with a third party such as a known serial killer or perhaps Jay who will then have some explaining to do. Either way the spotlight moves away from Don. If its Dons DNA then he can just say its from the night before. The other option is that Adnans appeal is ultimately successful. In that case then the options as I understand it are an Alfred plea or a retrial. Would the state bother with a retrial? Unlikely given the expense and likelihood of getting a conviction. It would be hard to secure a conviction given so much is based on witness testimony and so much time has passed. By that time Adnan would have been in prison for around  years and they would probably figure hes done enough time and cut their losses. In those circumstances I doubt they would look at the case again as they believe they already have their man. Edit spelling and grammar,serialpodcast,cyj4lkr,2,t5_33vph

He just has to be one unhappy guy maybe spoiled who is so unwilling to tough it out that he leaves post wanting attention. Then the US military steps up and does everything to find him even if he went rogue. This way the US is the caring supportive parent who just wants to bring home their lost son and help him. They can justify a lot of actions on that narrative including the trade that brought him home.So far Koenig seems to be setting that up. Bowe hasnt come across as very likeable yet even though the motives Koenig presents could definitely be understandable. The other soldiers interviewed talk about going through hell trying to find a guy they didnt even like anymore someone they thought might be a traitor even. Then when they talk about him being rescued and hearing hes giving the military information they soften. This is the ideal view that could be presented of the military I think.

6221628,0,t1_cywsezg,It doesnt seem like excellent would be the word most people would use for their efforts but okay Ill bite.Im not going to lie I am pretty new to the case so I do appreciate you outlining the events that werent talked about in Serial etc  even if you are doing so in an incredibly sarcastic way and I know Im not going to change your mind but if there are things Im missing out on please let me know.Have you got a source for that? Because I hadnt seen that being brought up before.I dont understand why youre bringing up the fact that they checked the boyfriends alibi  am I meant to be happy that they did a basic part of their jobs?Yeah its definitely weird the whole did youdid you not ask for a ride and the track situation no doubt about that  especially considering Adnan reschedules but I again dont see how that shows that he is guilty without reasonable doubt.When it comes to Haes body being found what investigation and theories were done when it comes to the potential involvement of Mr S? Is there something Im missing?Again the track thing definitely weird but isnt the inconsistencies with the way the cell towers records were used? Like the locations do not match the timelines that Jay gives?Yup weird that they decided not to speak to Jen and Jay properly about how they helped get rid of the sholves etc.Why is it that every time they speak to Jay theres hours of precall conversations that werent recorded?No doubt Jay was involved and isnt telling the truth.I really dont think of the note that much because a lot of boys that were dumped at  exaggerated on how it was the worst thing ever not to mention that if you were to look through most peoples notes in high school Im sure you could find similarly disturbing things though this is a very odd thing to have on a note about this break up.You seem to be putting a lot of value on the things Jay says and ignoring Adnan because he cant remember anything  but Jay changed his accounts various times? Isnt it also true that his initial accounts didnt match Jens account?Thats one of the issues this sub has helped me discover after listening to Serial this whole Nisha call is super weird.If youre going to point out every time Jay is right then are you going to do the same every time he is wrong? Are you going to point out how on one particular interview with the police he admits to have previously lied yet they decide not to push him on that?Because they didnt there are plenty of things they shouldve done but potentially didnt due to the fact that Jay gave them a suspect early on and to be honest it does not sound like Adnan had a fair trial.Now Im not going to lie I wouldnt be surprised if Adnan was in fact involved with the murder or was the murderer I just do not believe that at the time of the trial he had a fair trial and that there was enough evidence to put him away for life.,serialpodcast,cywtydw,4,t5_33vph

6379484,1,t1_czdvj9w,gt there is no physical evidence that Haes body was ever in the trunk of her car.Citation needed. Was the trunk of the car processed for DNA or other physical evidence? If it wasnt then you cant know what was or wasnt in that trunk. Furthermore even if she hadnt been stuffed in there you could still probably find hairs of hers or fibers that resembled fibers from some garment of hers. They wouldnt necessarily be conclusive on their own. Just as you would like to dismiss Adnans print on the map page so could you dismiss a stray hair of hers  or even his  found in her trunk. If it wasnt part of the trial then the trunk was most likely not processed for DNA or physical evidence of a body. There is no evidence that she was not in the trunk. The investigators accepted it as a fact because it just makes sense. Lack of a specific type of evidence means nothing if no effort was made to collect that evidence. Youre under the spell of modern TV shows like CSI.Had this case been tried in the old days before hairs fibers DNA etc. were all considered by the uninformed public to be essential to proving guilt  fuck it make it before the technologies to process such things existed would you say that the lack of hair in the evidence file was a critical flaw in the case? How do you think we convicted killers before DNA testing was available? Shit even fingerprinting is only about  years old.Another thing to remember is that Adnan wasnt convicted of putting a body in a trunk. It is possible though I dont think this is the case that Hae was never stuffed in her own trunk. What I am saying is you dont need to believe she was in her own trunk to believe that Adnan killed her. I do believe she was and Im sure every single person on the jury believed she was. But its not something the state went out of its way to prove. It wasnt trying to prove it because it didnt need to prove it.LOL some mouth breather was stupid or petty enough to downvote this post.

Id add that the theory of Jay randomly stumbling across Haes car is also highly unlikely because Haes car was a common model amp color with no distinguishing markings.  Jay was not Haes friend  so if we exclude the experience of seeing the car with the body in the trunk  there is no particular reason he would recognize Haes car even if he did for some reason happen to stumble upon the lot where it was parked.  After all  no one else in the neighborhood thought there was anything remarkable enough about the car to merit calling the police or reporting it.  ,serialpodcast,czg8rxq,18,t5_33vph

6412952,0,t3_43j3fw,gt Adnan killed Hae but it happened a completely different way than what the state were saying. Timing method circumstances location are all off.This is a more credible theory of Adnans guilt than anything else we have heard.  However... . The actions you attribute to the prosecution and the police are explicity illegal police and prosecutorial misconduct conduct that ought to lead to lead to Urick Murphy amp co getting disbarred building a case around the known to them perjury of their key witnesses etc.gt This is coming from someone who initially was convinced that Adnan was innocent and I still really want to believe that he was but this is the only explanation that in my mind makes any sense.Well it is in some ways the most charitable explanation of the motives and actions of the state in this case.  Knew he was guilty knew they had no case so fabricated a case.  The problems with this are. There are obvious actions the police could have taken that might have implicated Adnan but were never taken.  Most obviously they could have done DNA testing at the time.  . The best you can say is that for the police and the prosecution is they honestly believed Adnan was guilty.  But we know that police and prosecution arent infallible  there have been many DNAbased exonerations and the number of wrongful convictions must be significantly greater than that.  Why should we trust in the beliefs of the police and not in their evidence or lack thereof?. At a big picture level allowing this kind of thing to happen prosecution via fabricated case would be a disaster.  However many wrongful convictions we see in the US the number would skyrocket if this became an accepted practice.gt There are tons of indications that their story is wrong but few believable indications that Adnan is innocent. I think that if he were some absolute proof of this would have emerged at this point. . My counter argument would be If Adnan were absolutely guilty some absolute proof of this should have emerged at some point. In general it is far harder to prove a negative X did not happen than it is to prove the positive. Especially if we are going to allow one side to fabricate key elements of its case.  . You have sort of reversed the burden of proof here. A criminal defendant is presumed innocent and the prosecutions burden is to prove otherwise. If your argument is true then they failed to meet that burden.  gt What hes actually saying is If they hade been able to prove with physical evidence that I had killed her I wouldnt be claiming innocence. But since they cant I can still sow some doubt into peoples minds.I dont think this kind of parsing of words is all that useful.  You could be right or wrong about this.  I dont think its unreasonable to expect a wrongfully convicted person to comment on the states lack of physical evidence against him.    ,serialpodcast,czil67f,16,t5_33vph

6422634,0,t1_czjmp1b,Theres something going on here that goes beyond a new trial.  The letter writing thing bothers me.  Even for those on the guilty side a new trial could clear up a lot of ambiguous evidence.  We claim to be impartial when we look at the evidence.  Yet if were writing him letters in prison we are no longer impartial.  We can no longer look at the evidence objectively conclude guilt and realize that weve thus sent letters of support to a murderer ... most people do not have the wherewithall to accept that conclusion about themselves.  Even great intelligence has no bearing on our aptitude for psychological introspection.  Once letters get sent those people are forever on the innocent side no matter what evidence comes to light.  Sure theyll claim theyll change their opinion should clear and convincing evidence come out but weve all seen this phenomenon in other areas of life it just doesnt happen.  ,serialpodcast,czjmxpq,7,t5_33vph

They did some deep investigations for a long time and discovered that the rabbit hole was deeper than they had imagined and that those key bits of evidence werent as key as once thought. Koenig set out hoping to tell an interesting story and perhaps solve a small mystery.. on a medium that has historically been for small niche audiences. Koenig said she couldnt say that Adnan didnt do it just that the trial wasnt legit which this hearing is clearly showing. You folks act like Koenig came out if left field and marketed a biased narrative into your living room on prime time television in order to wreck the Lee familys lives.

Why? For what reason. If it was so high a likelihood then would they then not try to do that. They acted extremely odd in this case and guilter or nonguilter alike can make that claim. Urick et all are goons.I mean if my cell phone shows I am at work all day and then go home and then go to a restaurant or a hockey game occasionally but then on the day I am suspected for murder in another town it shows me in that town...well its not always reliable seems like an extremely lame defense.Well today yes but when there is a note that says outgoing will  be reliable and incoming will not what is the reason for that. There obviously is a difference between the two otherwise why would they be differentiated. I dont know how many records they have but blah blah blah may be unreliable sounds a lot like legalese trying to avoid lawsuits not some blanket indictment of the location data especially because that data mostly makes sense.Thats the thing this is the law.

Asia wasnt contacted so she wasnt fully investigated. In short the argument is that contacting the alibi witness is necessary for a sufficient investigation. In the case you cite the alibi witness was contacted so the same argument doesnt apply. The investigation could have failed in some other way as contacting the alibi witness presumably isnt sufficient for a full investigation. Thats what youre focusing on when you discuss the fact that evidence wasnt looked for etc. and saying that the alibi wasnt investigated fully under some standard.

I get that youre talking about the usual suspects here and at SPO and that you feel most of them have concluded one thing vs. another. But in the real world and among lurkers and hell among the jury even... there are probably a ton of people who are open to the idea of premeditation open to the idea of spontaneous crime of passion and open to the idea of a little of both but who dont really care as long as the right guy is in prison. Technically he is in prison for premeditated murder. And since you believe he is guilty of premeditated murder and he has never fessed up it is surprising to me that you also would advocate for his release.

6632146,0,t1_d055bzi,No..its not correct.  Which tower covers which area is a given map..its an established fact..established by the experts. My goal was to determine if the pinging data is consistent with that factmap. This is truly my last attempt..Im really exhausted. So if you still disagree..then we will have to agree to disagree because I will not reply to you again regarding this issue...  Think of the process as  phases  First phase is to answer my question about the reliability of the cell pinging data..is it reliable?  In order to determine that I decided to use the calls where the location was known..at least IMO.   Adnan called Jay from school at  am on ..  What did the pinging data show? That call pinged the tower that normally covers the school gt Data is reliableAdnan and Jay visited Cathy on  somewhere between  pm and  pm. He received  incoming calls during that period..    What did the pinging data show? Two of those calls pinged the tower that has the strongest signal for her house. One call pinged a tower that has a weak signal for her house but still covers her area again it still covers her area Dont forget that small detail about the visit to Cathy is an already established fact. And part of that already established fact is them driving to get to her home ..that too is a fact. In other words..Adnan didnt leave school and instantlymagically appeared at her house.   So I considered the pinging data of the  incoming calls consistent with the fact they were at Cathysgt Data is reliable  Adnan was homeMosque from around  to  pm. This was based on a combination of factors..Adnans father and Adnan himself said he was homeMosque the night of    Jenn said that Adnan dropped Jay off at Westview Mall around  pm. To me..its a fact that Adnan was home the night of . Adnan placed  calls that night.  What did the pinging data show? Six of those calls pinged the tower that normally covers his homeMosquegt Thats high enough to consider the data reliable.  Conclusion Cell pinging data is fairly reliableThe second phase Based on the conclusion of the first phase..I have been using the cell data to prove locations. So when Jay said that they were at Park and Ride when he called Jenn at  pm..I didnt believe it..as the call pinged the tower that covers Best Buy.  Also now I can say that its most likely than not Adnan was in the LB area when he called Yasser at  pm..,serialpodcast,d05bkq5,1,t5_33vph

6666974,0,t3_46s5jt,Hello I just recently discovered your podcast and have been listening to the commentary about Serial Season .  Its been great to listen to other peoples opinions about the series.  Congrats on getting a sponsor and best of luck in the future.I do want to comment about the right by accident remark.  As I understand it Bowes big picture statement is that the war in Afghanistan is not being carried out right and that unless significant changes are made the US will lose and Americans will needlessly die.  He comes to this conclusion with two perceived events. His commanding officer makes an offbase remark about not shaving after his troops return from a dangerous mission.. His leadership made a big deal about what he believed was another minor issue when his squad got in trouble for doffing their uniforms while working.With those two events he believes that his commanding officer is going to send his platoon on a suicide mission to kill them all and eliminate their liability to his reputation as a commander.  As I understood it Sarah said that those two things were Bowes primary concerns not whether or not the mission to recover the MRAPs was valid the poor planning of the MRAP mission or the poor placement of the defensive positions at the outpost.If I understand this correctly then it seems to me that Bowes conclusion about the war in general is right by accident.  He didnt say the US was going to lose the war because counterinsurgency was a failed strategy or that US troops werent winning and holding the trust of the local population or that his leaders were making specific tactical and operational mistakes that were getting men killed no one died on the missions described in the podcast etc.  Any of those could be valid reasons why the war was not going well.  He fixated on two minor and relatively inconsequential data points in the vast set that was the war and believed that they tied in to why the war was being lost.Two other comments about the episode I would not be so fixated on whether or not it was right to send troops on a mission to recover the disabled MRAPs.  This is war and decisions of life and death are made.  If I had to pick a failure on that mission I would ask why the plan to go up the mountain seemed poorly fleshed out to begin with no contingencies in case another MRAP broke down? and why it took so long for leadership to come up with a course of action once the relief team broke down.  The Serial podcast makes it sound like they were waiting up there for days with no action being taken but that may just be a consequence of interviewing the low men on the totem pole who may not have had higher insight to the plan. When the squad leader told the First Sergeant about his concern for Bowe if the story is true and played out as described the First Sergeant was completely off base for telling him to fuck off.  Any situation of mental stress like that is supposed to be taken seriously especially in a combat situation.  That said I wonder if the squad leader brought up his worries about Bowe to anyone else in his chain of command such as the platoon sergeant platoon leader medics or chaplain.  I have had Sailors who struggled with alcoholism selfharm depression and suicidal ideations and in all cases we try our best to get them the help they needed.  Even from a cynical point of view a servicemember disabled by those issues degrades the units ability to complete the mission so it is in our interest to get them help.Side note Im a US Navy Officer so I understand how the military works but I do not have ground experience in Iraq or Afghanistan.  ,serialpodcast,d08x8fx,1,t5_33vph

6670217,0,t1_d08z0fw,I havent seen those posts and Jays everchanging story is consistent with false confessions.  To point out one glaring example  part of his story shifts after the police discover a cell tower is marked in the wrong place on their map.  Where his story had an element near the fictional cell tower previously it shifts to meet the new evidence.  This is someone using information given to him to build his narrative.I dont think its straightforward the police knew where the car was but I dont think its likely they did.  Some have had fairly good arguments that they could have known though Im not convinced by them and Jay isnt put on record describing the location or telling them the location beyond a very vague comment about being off Edmondson Ave.  It seems to me odd that the police arent very interested in this information on the tape.  They pretty much drop questioning him about the car other than to ask him to affirm that hes agreed to take them to it.  ,serialpodcast,d099akh,2,t5_33vph

I think the cops also planted Stevens blood in her car.I think the key was planted thats a very obvious one and I think the bullet was probably planted.I do like Jim Clementes theory that Steven was rejected by Halbach and Steven raped her and decided to burn the body due to incriminating evidence he would have left behind if he raped her.

6753311,0,t1_d0hpkda,I actually think that the letters were never given to any of the attorneys.  If Adnan had given the letters to CG then they wouldnt have been in his possession down the line to give to Rabia. I think the letters were actually written in March and were the result of a collaboration among Adnan and his friends Justin A. and Juwan to establish an alibi in the hopes that would help with Adnans bail hearing. I think Adnan wanted a nice simple typed up letter establishing that he had been in the library from the time school let out until pm. I think that Asia was a willing participant who probably had seen Adnan the week before on the th but was being pressured to put more in her letter than she was willing to commit to so the letter that Adnan wanted for court was never written. The letters that Asia did write were unusable because they revealed too much about Asias contact with Adnans family and friends. I think that any efforts to persuade Asia were abandoned after Adnans nd bail hearing on March st simply because at that point there was no hope of the letter being used to help secure early release.  I also think that Asia probably had backed off and lost interest in helping with Adnans case by that time.   I think that at some point someone associated with the defense did look into the Asia claim but was unable to reach Asia and ended up talking to Justin A. instead.  I think that Justin A. had an independent recollection of the encounter because as Adnan has testified Adnan had mentioned it to him the Monday following the meeting and Justin A. knew or figured out that it was a different day and told that to whoever reached him. I think that if in fact it were true that no one from the defense had checked into the Asia story then there would have been testimony from CGs former law clerks at the PCR hearing to help establish that. ,serialpodcast,d0hul93,7,t5_33vph

6794829,0,t1_d0mfdcp,He could still offer testimony at a trial.  We dont know what it would be yet but if its anything like his conversations on Serial it wouldnt be too detrimental possibly helpful.The State made it very clear during their closing that the call log was essential evidence.  That it was essential for corroborating Jays testimony.  IF Adnan is granted a new trial theres a strong possibility that the call log wont be deemed admissible or at the very least the incoming calls specifically the ones placing Adnan in Leakin Park would not be admitted.  We also have no guarantee that Jay or Jenn would be willing to testify again at a rd trial this many years later.  Last we heard Jay seemed like he wanted to stay out of it and since he already handled the condition of cooperation for his conviction he has no legal obligation to participate in a third trial.  This also doesnt include that fact that Asia has made it clear she would testify at a new trial as well as the fact that Adnan has completely different counsel this time.The State has three options after a granting of new trial proceed with a new trial offer a very promising plea deal or dismiss the case.  As Ive already stated I dont believe Adnan would accept a plea deal so his main options are to see if the state will even proceed with a trial dismissal or if they do go to trial.I also dont believe Adnan would be particularly worried about staying in custody awaiting a new trial.But obviously there is no room for agreement between us.  You are living deep in the hes guilty so his only option is to take a plea or get convicted again while I am of the opinion that the state might not even proceed with another trial or there is a good chance the jury would acquit at a new trial.,serialpodcast,d0mhfso,1,t5_33vph

There is no outside corroboration that a wrestling match actually took place that evening.  Two schools are mentioned by various witnesses as potential opponents but they played against that school the previous week scores reported in the local newspaper and the other school had a match against another school the evening before also reported in the paper so its unlikely theyd be playing two matches in two days.  Also there are no scores reported in the newspaper for Woodlawn for that evening.  So outside sources would tend to suggest that the witnesses remembering details of a wrestling match are remembering the wrong day.  However Hae also mentions a wrestling match in her note to Don written that day.  Is it possible she was mistaken about there being a match?

7067592,0,t1_d1h4o8u,gt Oops.gt Moving uEvidenceProf s Claim of Credibility to the Implausible ColumnWhy does the memo say that Nisha was interviewed either on or later than  April ?uSerialfan do you have any theories on that point?IMHO it is unclear whether Nisha was interviewed once or more than once and unclear as to the exact date or dates.However I think it would be a stunning dereliction of duty if the first time that the cops ever spoke to Nisha was in April .IMHO it is overwhelmingly likely that the cops spoke to Nisha either before  Feb or on  Feb or in the first few days after  Feb.Based on the call log alone the cops would have had no idea who called Nisha at .pm.  Based on the call log it would not be possible to guess that Nisha had ever spoken to both Adnan and Jay during the same call.HOWEVER based on the call log alone there was a call made to a person Nisha less than  minutes after Hae was seen leaving school according to their theory at the time and  or  minutes after Hae was supposed to collect her cousin.So  of course  the cops would know that it would be important to speak to Nisha to find out if Adnan whose phone it was had sounded out of breath at .pm or if he mentioned being with Hae or if he mentioned anything at all that would help their investigation.The theory that the cops never spoke to Nisha until after Jays  March taped interview is a very difficult one to believe.  And of course if they did speak to Nisha before  March then why has the record of that been suppressed?Are the typed notes supposed to say  March but are innocently dated  April by mistake?Are the typed notes dated  April because that is when they were typed up even though the interview was a few weeks earlier?Are the typed notes and the memo both part of a deliberate attempt to make out that Nisha was not spoken to until April and the fact that they indicate different interview dates is a smoking gun?,serialpodcast,d1hh2rm,3,t5_33vph

7073627,1,t3_4cg92x,gt What do you guys think? I put this theory firmly in the plausible category.Yeah nice work.  It does seem plausible.Speaking for myself I am not in the Adnan is definitely innocent camp or the The Guilty Man has definitely already been caught camp.However The Nisha Call is a large point against the Prosecution Theory imho.We have an independent witness with no axe to grind as far as we know.  As with anyone else we must consider the possibility of honest mistakes but at least we have little reason to suspect her of lying.So when Nisha says that she clearly remembers that Adnan claimed to be walking to a porn store and claims that Jay worked at the porn store then this is not  IMHO  something that a neutral should just ignore.According to the typed document produced by cops Nisha seems to have remembered something about a store that Jay worked in.  Theres no strong reason to believe that the word porn only entered her memory banks AFTER the cops had spoken to her and BEFORE Trial .  It is obviously conceivable that that is what happened.  But is it more likely than not?  As a neutral I would say not.I think it is worth mentioning that porn in  is much more socially acceptable than it was in .  In the absence of clear information to the contrary I am going to assume that Nisha had never been to a porn store and was not used to menboys telling her that they were about to walk into a porn store.I think that if the first time that Nisha found out that it was possible that she had been on the phone to Adnan while he was in such an unusual to her establishment was when a cop or a lawyer or an investigator told her then I think that she would remember that.  ie I think she would be surprised and think Oh wow.  He never told me that.  Likewise if the first time she was told that Jay worked in a porn store was when Adnan mentioned in before putting Jay on the phone then I think she would remember that too.   To be blunt when she was talking to Jay she would have probably been thinking This guy works in a PORN STORE.  So Nisha simply learning about the true nature of Jays workplace later on does not make much sense to me.And of course she is asked on oath if her and Adnan ever discussed Jay on any other occasion either before or after The Jay Call.  She claims on oath that they did not do so.So for me I would say that I am  sure that Jay and Nisha did not speak to each other on  January  at .pm. Does that mean that Adnan is innocent?Nope.  It is obviously possible that the cops leaned on Jay to tweak his evidence to match their theory and yet  in fact  a lot of what Jay said was still true.  So The Nisha Call could be a butt dial or The Nisha Call could be just Adnan not Jay speaking to Nisha or there are many other possibilities and it does not prove that Adnan  Innocent.BUT the huge problems for the Prosecution Theory are.  If Jay lied about this then what else did he lie about?.  If Nisha does not corroborate Jay then nothing at all corroborates Jay for any of the period .pm to .pm.  ,serialpodcast,d1i5qes,3,t5_33vph

You have to remember that Jay also was arrested shortly before Adnan for assaulting a police officer during what was a routine traffic stop.  In fact from the descriptions I have heard Jay freaked out and knocked two cops to the ground.  Here is why I think Jay is sociopathic Jay either killed a girl or he helped bury the body of the girl and seemed to have no remorse for weeks about it.  He allowed her family to wonder what happened to her for  weeks.  He didnt say anything about this to Stephanie who continued to hang out with Adnan during this time.  He never mentioned anything to her until Adnan was arrested and even then I think it was a few weeks after he was arrested. In the Intercept Jay complains about how people have reacted to the Serial podcast.  This is typical sociopathic behavior it is all about Jay.  He helped dispose of the dead body of young girl kept it secret for several weeks never went to the police let the family live in torment and then complains about how he is being treated.

Your appeal to No One would is a combination of two logical fallacies.   incredulity and  ignorance.EditDid Don indicate his interaction with Adnan was in any way threatening or hostile?  Did Don report any indication that Adnan disapproved of his relationship with Hae?  From what I recall Adnan explicitly stated his approval just wanted to make sure you were a good guy.  I think Don has said DA Urick was not happy that he didnt lie to make the interactions sound more hostile.When I read the notes I dont find anything setting off alarm bells.  Adnan expresses deep personal feelings.  He expresses profound sadness and emotional pain all of which is to be expected.  At the same time he never expresses a desire to return to the relationship.  The entire tone of the letter is that the relationship is over and he wants very much to move into a phase of building a friendship.Your argument that no one Adnans age could be so mature lacks concrete data to support it.  Unless you are an expert on adolescent behavior and relationships I dont think you are entitled to describe my position as naive.

There are many people that have stated that they dont FOCUS on the trial or conviction just the question of whether he is de facto guilty but that is not the same as saying that they dont care if the trial was fair or not as you imply.I dont feel like digging around but Ive seen that sentiment expressed in more than one way.  Most common has been the poster doesnt want him to win his appeal based on a technicality because in the posters opinion hes guilty.  On your other points Jay wasnt questioned in that much detail about his changing stories.  That was probably tactical on CGs part.  In Maryland the jury is free to dream up their own scenario as to how the murder might have happened and bludgeoning Jay with every contradictory statement might have opened up some alternative scenarios.  But she did get him to admit to lying a lot in his statements to the police a tactic that was likely blunted by his calm demeanor on the stand.   I dont know what you mean by this.  The homicide dicks were heard from in both trials...but I have no idea what clarity you think theyd bring that they didnt provide in the two trials. Jenns account is surreal but its a definite problem for those who want to think Adnan is innocent andor Jay wasnt involved I agree.  As she doesnt actually know anything about the murder except what Jay told her however I dont think shes an insurmountable problem for Adnans defense. I recall Adnan and Jay spoke on  I dont recall seeing they were together that evening.  The morning of and extended lunch are the same thing with Adnan showing up at Jays sometime after  am and getting dropped off between  and .  Other than Jay and perhaps The Nisha Call theres no evidence they were together again before the end of track practice.  Other than seeing this in a deliberately sinister light its not not good for AS.  Its just the timeline of his day.  An Adnan who saw Jay in the morning to loan him his car and saw Jay after track practice isnt an Adnan who committed a murder.  The afternoon period OTOH which is when Jay says he committed the murder etc. is.   and  These have squat to do with the murder.  Its more sinisterthinking.  Hes the exboyfriend not the current one and weve no way of knowing how often he calledpaged her between when they broke up in Dec. and his acquiring his cell phone.  Youre pathetic points as much to innocence as to guilt.  Its another one of those ridiculous premises where people pretend theres some sort of rulebook called The Proper Way To Act When Youre Wrongfully Accused of Murder.  Only theres no such book and certainly no such rules.,serialpodcast,d2438et,1,t5_33vph

Adnans good buddy Imran sent an email to Haes friends in California before Haes body was found telling them not to bother looking for her because she was dead.. Several of Adnans friends described him as being mad or devastated about Hae dumping him.. Juan said Adnan asked Asia to write the alibi letter. At the time Adnan was in Central Booking he also inquired about how mail would be scrutinized at that facility.. Asias second alibi letter is dated only a day after her first alibi letter yet contains details about the crime that had not been released to the public.. In her police interview Nisha says the damning Adnan and Jay call occurred a day or two after Adnan got the phone making it highly unlikely it occurred any day other than the th.. Debbie said Adnan was possessive and paranoid about Don.. Adnans phone only pinged the Leakin Park tower one other day in the period we have records for  the day Jay was arrested.. Phone records reveal Adnans father perjured himself on the stand when he claimed Adnan went to mosque.. In Adnans first PCR hearing he claims to have given the Asia letters to CG but she wasnt even his lawyer at the time. He is also incredibly evasive on the stand.. As late as October Adnan had not come clean to his own lawyer regarding the Cathy visit. He claimed to have been in the car when Adcock called and left Cathy out of his narrative completely.. Adnan was evading an inperson interview with the police regarding the disappearance of Hae. He repeatedly told the police not to contact his house.. Adnan stole from Debbie a questionnaire a teacher was passing out about the disappearance of Hae before Debbie could complete it and hand it in.. Adnan told the same teacher to stop investigating.. Adnans good friend Saad was also caught going through Adnans teachers papers.. Hae once asked a teacher at Woodlawn to help her hide from Adnan.. At a party a day or two after Hae went missing Adnan said nothing about her disappearance to his friends.. At another party after Hae went missing he was asked about her and responded with We broke up rather than mention her disappearance which was not widespread news yet.. Adnan and his legal team have decided to not pursue DNA testing.. A teacher at Woodlawn said Adnan once referred to Leakin Park as a good place to dump a body. Later after Haes disappearance another teacher noted that Adnan played dumb about Leakin Parks reputation.. Adnans parents were not strict he had no curfew and was a mediocre student who often cut class and got high. When Adnans parents invaded the school dance they yelled at Hae not their son. On the stand Adnans father admits that his son returned to the dance that night and that he was powerless to disallow him. Adnans parents had a problem with Hae not Adnan.THIS IS JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. Im sure there are more Im forgetting.

God damn youre so dense. Its insane how in inept you are of the English language.Korell said it was anterior lividity. Hlavaty says it was anterior lividity.

7497887,0,t1_d2ufb3e,gtAgain youre demanding a specificity that often is not found in the law. No Im not. Im asking for any case at all in which deficient performance was not found for failure to contact an alibi witness due to any reason thats roughly comparable to the ones you list below.gtAnd if you look at the case law outside of narrowly talking about contact youll see a variety of strategic considerations that CG couldve validly considered and JBs disinterest in finding out forces us to speculate in a way that will be deferential to CG I expect in deciding to not pursue Asia as an alibi all of which was only strengthened at the PCR hearing CG thought Asia was lying or offering to lie Griffin v. Warden explicitly rejects the argument that an attorneys claimed fear that the witness would commit perjury amounts to the basis for a reasonable strategic decision not to call him or her.gtshe thought her testimony would make it seem more likely that Adnan intercepted HaeIn Grooms v. Solem the court held that its unreasonable not to contact an alibi witness just because the attorney anticipates some notional problem might result.Besides which CG could not have known what Asias testimony was even going to be because she did not contact or interview her. Nor did she have any good reason to suppose that the state would argue the abduction or murder occurred in the library parking lot.Could you remind me again what that ones about though? IIRC its something Jay said somewhere but I dont know where. gther testimony contradicted what the defendant told the policeNot according to the police.Source?gtor she obtained information that Asia had the wrong day. Howd she manage to do that without contacting Asia?How could she have managed to do that without contacting Asia?gtAll of these are valid strategic reasons to not pursue an alibiTwo of them decidedly arent according to Maryland courts.Two of them arent things it would have been possible for CG to conclude without contacting Asia to find out what she had to say.And one of them is based on the erroneous belief that Adnan told the police something he didnt.gtI know your response will shoehorn the strategic issue into the contact issue and say that they both need to be squarely dealt with in the same case but theres no real reason thats true. If you can tell me how CG knew Asia had the wrong day or that her testimony would place Adnan at the scene of some unspecified thing that Im afraid youre going to have to remind me of then Ill cop to shoehorning. Until then its you whos making a faulty argument there being no other apparent way for her to have known either thing.gtIf theres no duty to pursue an alibi that has been validly deemed unhelpful after sufficient investigation theres no need to engage in a pointless pantomime of contact in order to avoid a constitutional violation.What sufficient investigation exactly?

7633771,0,t1_d39r0p8,See I just think your line of reasoning is pedantic. Youre not a lawyer you cant influence Adnans part in this case at all. Saying he should be considered innocent because of police misconduct entirely sidesteps the issue of whether or not he committed the crime. In fact I think your post shows one of the worst parts of this podcast or at least season  The entire narrative is about the guilt or innocence of Adnan Syed. Its not about the murderer of Hae Min Lee. When you look at it from Adnans perspective its easy to see reasons he shouldnt be in jail. The prosecution story doesnt make sense. Jay lies. The timeline doesnt add up. The calls dont add up. Somethings fishy. Look at it from Haes perspective Who could have done it? Maybe Don. But... Adnan didnt know Don well Jay didnt know Don well... Why would Jay rat out Adnan if they werent involved? Why would they be involved with Don? Maybe Jay could have done it? But why? How? Adnan doesnt say Jay did it. He says he and Jay were completely uninvolved. They just... drove around and smoked blunts and hung out. Normal day. If Jay did it Adnan would know. But if Adnan were in jail for something Jay did why wouldnt he just rat Jay out? Or... did Jay do it while Adnan was totally uninvolved and Jay just played it cool all day while they smoked blunts? Or? Or what? I get that tests of available evidence and procedural propriety might yield a not in prison result. But constructing a reasonable narrative of the crime that doesnt include Adnan being at least directly complicit in the murder of Hae Min Lee and still explains the actions of both Jay and Adnan seems impossible. I cant access procedural justice in this case. It is outside the scope of my power. I can access narrative justice. The truth must be known. And as far as I can tell the truth must involve Adnan. Hes in on it. If he didnt do it he knows who did and isnt talking. As an aside I do have a theory that I think implicates Adnan but also adequately explains both his and Jays actions later. In fact Im surprised it doesnt get more play here its a classic mystery trope. So classic I kind of doubt it on face myself. Theres a third man. Its somebody Jay knows. If it were someone in Adnans camp Jay would rat them out too. Someone who helped them. Remember how Jays coworker said Jay was scared of a van outside of his work? He claimed it was Adnans people. Apparently by name. But it was his own people. Telling him to out Adnan in order to deflect any further liability from themselves. It explains the bottle of Brandy. It possibly explains Mr. S. It explains why Jay still says Adnan did it. It explains why Jay never tells the truth. It explains how Adnan could still believe there was problems with his conviction eg he would know they used faulty evidence to convict him because the states case doesnt include the third man and if they used faulty evidence to convict him he should be let go and continually claim his innocence. Can we not all those of us who believe Adnan killed Hae and those of us who believe the evidence at trial was faulty and insufficient can we not all agree that Adnan and Jay just got themselves a Winston Wolfe and thought they could get away with it? ,serialpodcast,d39x255,7,t5_33vph

7635657,0,t1_d37ye8x,It will be interesting how people view this strategy if Steven Averys new lawyer truly does present evidence May  that exonerates him. The state rushed to create a test to see if there was preservative in the blood found in the Rav  and the results came back as not having a measurable amount which implied that the blood was fresh and not from a vial of blood previously drawn from Avery. If new evidence shows that there really was preservative in the blood found in the Rav  then it would mean the blood was planted by police and would blow the case wide open. So if Adnan is winning his PCR hearing and pushes for DNA testing when he doesnt know what the results will be hes potentially risking his ultimate freedom.

And you havent even made an argument that its possible let alone probable.So I think the chances that Judge Welch or anyone else will conjure up that explanation in rebuttal of Gordons testimony when nobody not even the State suggested anything of the kind are nonexistent.gtBTW did you find a case where IAC was found and no strategic decision considered when the PCR attorney avoided testimony from anyone who worked on the case? Not bc theres a mechanical rule mind you but purely illustrative purposes.No but neither did I find a case in which the petitioner put on evidence to support an argument that he wasnt making.

Be honest.My view of the case is that theres very little hard evidence of anything much which leads me to a benefit of the doubt position for the accused  i.e. Id vote to acquit. I have no clue about how things actually went down one way or the other so dont really have a position on factual innocenceguilt. Anythings possible in my mind based on the evidence we have.That said I do find myself arguing against the guilty view more than the innocent view. Ive often asked myself why that is and struggle to answer. A key reason I often post is to take issue with extremes in a guilty position  of the type the police notes definitely mean x or things that seen like contradictionsthings that are unfairunscientific  but Ive noticed I dont do this so much with an extreme innocent position. Im not sure if thats because there are fewer of them or if they are more often phrased in a way thats less definite or if they dont irk me so much because theyre also a benefitofthedoubt position.gt  In retrospect are there any issues that kinda bother you even a little? Which ones? Is there anything that could potentially cause you to flip? Any potential dealbreakers lurking in the ether?The Jayknowingwherethecaris thing has always bothered me  though this also seems to me to be more evidence of Jays involvement not necessarily Adnans. But the unrecorded segment is a huge issue for me given thats where the car was first mentioned and given the propensity of the police to coaching Jay see incorrect tower location example  this doesnt mean I think they faked loads of the carsearching evidence... just that maybe on finding he car they went straight to JennJay for formal questioning.Jenns initial police interview seemed fairly cohesive as a story about what happened... which sounded convincing... but then didnt always match Jays story and I dont get why it didnt.I wish we had a recording of the original police phone call to Adnan so we could clear up the ride request stuff.I reeeeally want to know the real reason Jay and Jenn alibied each other until way past the supposed CAGMC  and why the state didnt craft a narrative around this timesuggest a landline CAGMC or something.Dons timecards bother me.Dealbreakers... Im really not sure there are any dealbreakers that are particularly likely at this late stage in the day! Which is frustrating. I cant imagine were going to see any confessions or that DNA testing will show anything much but obviously either would be a dealbreaker.

A party loses then having lost they find some new evidence and thinks I wish Id had this at the trialhearing.  It might have made all the difference.So is society better served by trying to get a perfect decision?  ie by holding a new trialhearing which takes into account the new evidence as well as the old?Or is society better served by saying No.  Theres a limit to how much court time we can spend on this.  Our resources are finite.  If we give these parties another two week hearing then some other parties are going to have to wait a bit longer.  And is society better served by saying The rule should be that parties must accept that the onus is on them to gather evidence that they want to use.  No party should think that they get two bites of the cherry or else they might think that there is a positive advantage to failing to investigate a particular matter and instead holding it in reserve in case they lose at Trial .Most jurisdictions have rules which basically say that the party which wants to use new evidence must be able to clearly demonstrate both the importance of that evidence and that there is an impeccable reason that it was not available previously.

I cant imagine an argument under which Jay could ever NOT be permitted to take the fifth  the definition of what could incriminate someone is so broad and hes potentially guilty of so many crimes. Even if there was some technicality where Jay was already convicted of the lesser offense of accessory and somehow a promise was made he couldnt be incriminated as to anything else impossible and then the prosecutor tried to force him to testify at Adnans trial on the grounds that hey Jay youre no longer capable of being incriminated by your testimony because youve been convicted already... I cant imagine how it would actually work. Basically I dont think a criminal can ever be prevented from taking the fifth against his will. Which is why prosecutors offer sweet plea deals to get people to turn on each other and confess their role  the only way they can get them to testify is if its voluntary. ETA Something as simple as the prosecution asking Jay Have you ever smoked weed? could be incriminating and if Jay refuses to answer boom hes done no more testimony on anything. ,serialpodcast,d7omy0h,1,t5_33vph
8959261,0,t1_d7ocegr,gt The problem for me is that this ie the states differing position on Asia vs the sisters seems to be correct. Asia wasnt a new witness in that she was known about by CG etc at the original trials. Hence the IAC claim for not calling her. Whereas the sisters are new in that the state doesnt seem to have been aware of them as recently as the PCR hearing. So saying you cant call someone you already knew about at an earlier trial doesnt appear to be equivalent to saying you cant call someone about whom you only became aware after the most recent proceedings. The PCR was reopened to hear Asias testimony because there was some reason to believe that shed been improperly prevented from appearing at the first one by Urick. Had that not been the case they would have lost their chance when they failed to produce her for the first one.This is not analogous to the states failure to produce the sisters. They have nobody but themselves to blame for that. And thats true irrespective of whether they knew about them. Whats material is that nothing prevented them from knowing about them  ie they knew they had the task of finding witnesses to impeach Asia McClain in plenty of time to find them. They didnt. And thats the end of that. Its arguable whether impeaching her ETA impeaching her via their testimony I mean would have had any bearing on the issue of IAC anyway. Theres no evidence that CG knew about the sisters and no obvious avenue by which she could have.The proper venue for their testimony is at trial.

9311558,1,t3_57z7qh,It is hard for me to say whether some of his statements are just inconsistencies or whether he was lying.  There are so many inconsistent statements made by witnesses that seemed to be based on how they were question and how they remembered things.  This is why the physical evidence would be so important.  For now Inez never saw him in the car with Hae when she was leaving.  That is consistent with him not getting a ride.  In addition Asia supposedly saw him in the library.  This is also consistent with him not getting a ride.  However the question is whether he asked for a ride.  I tend to think that he did based on witnesses but I also tend to think that Hae later told someone that she could not give him one based on witnesses...  They were out of school at  pm so he would have needed to get into her car right away after school if Inez is correct.  On the other hand since her cousin did not need to be picked up until  pm she had an hour after school.  If Hae stuck around after school there is a possibility that Inez did not see her leave.  This would mean that Adnan would have been able to get into her car without being seen.  However this comes with one caveat that the later she left school the less likely it is that she gave Adnan a ride.  However this would explain why Jays timeline does not support the prosecutions theory.  edit clarity,serialpodcast,d8wb44e,1,t5_33vph

There is nothing to stop LE from testing objects in its custody. Nothing. If it ever chooses to do so it can then compare the results of those tests against any individual whos unlucky enough to be in the DNA database. The state does not need a warrant probable cause or consent. Thats how it works for Adnan or for anyone else. Other commenters have stated that the state has no need to do this. I agree with this. As long as it stands behind the  conviction the state will not submit the objects for testing.

9403729,0,t1_d97ux4m,So basically the prosecutor asked a trick question?And Aisha is misremembering.I know youve put a lot of effort into making sense of it. I have too but Im not there with you. Im not settled on its meaning and it isnt important or even interesting to me. But what is interesting to me is how important it is for anyone who defends Adnan to explain it. I actually thought CG handled her cross of Aisha brilliantly. It would be a huge tactical error to focus on that line and ask Aisha if she remembered the other lines. Massive. During cross you try to limit the line of questioning to things that you are already sure of and phrase questions so that the witness has to answer with a simple yes or a no. You dont want them telling a story or offering their own interpretation. To ask Aisha whether she remembered the other lines specifically would have been a terrible risk. Because if Aisha said that she did remember the other lines all youve done is highlight and strengthen the prosecutions best moment. Theres no way CG could have known what Aisha would say about the other lines beyond what she testified to under direct.I disagree that Murphy was trying to shade Aishas statement a specific way. She knew what Aisha would say. Aisha could still be wrong or could be lying for her own reasons. But I dont think Murphy was using weaselly language to trick the jurors into misunderstanding Aishas meaning.As for Aishas statements on Serial  I think it is possible that her memory of the experience of testifying at trial has affected or in some sense replaced her memory of writing the note but I dont think its likely that Murphys trickery was such a powerful suggestive force that it has convinced Aisha that she never saw the line when in fact she had. Its clear that her memory of the note is strongly tied to what she remembers of her testimony  she about says as much. She knows what her purpose was in the trial but we cant ever know whether it ultimately affected the outcome. In other words if Aisha was tricked somehow into answering Murphys question in an incomplete or misleading way wed know about it. She would have told Koenig that she thinks her testimony was misleading  not perjury and nothing to recant just that for the sake of the permanent record she would like to add now that she isnt sure one way or the other about that specific line.I think her testimony anchored the memory for her and solidified her understanding of the note. If her testimony was in any way in conflict with her previous memory however gray that memory was I suspect that the conflict of that moment would be the anchoring point. Her reflection would be that she was intensely uncomfortable testifying to things she could not remember. Its impossible to miss the gravity of the moment. Murphy asks if she has a recollection of seeing that line she says no and Murphy says No further questions. Youd have to be an idiot to miss the point Murphy was trying to end on. Aisha is no idiot. She was asked beforehand during witness prep so she knew that question was coming. And she knew what her answer would be. Theyre acting out a play with a specific theme and denouement. If she found the act disagreeable dishonest or dishonorable I would be inclined to think that is what she would remember. Shed be saying to Koenig You know the prosecutor played a bit of a game there  she got me to say I didnt remember that one line when in fact I didnt remember any of it.None of this is to say that I think its impossible that shes wrong. Anything is possible. Like I said she could be lying for all I know. But in the absence of other evidence I find her statement that she does not remember the line compelling. Yes it is possible that she doesnt remember any of the other lines. Its possible that he wrote it contemporaneously and she just somehow didnt see it. Its possible he wrote it later but that it isnt a sign of homicidal or suicidal thoughts. I dont think its necessary to construct an interpretation of the note that includes an imaginary meaning for Im going to kill and depends on Aisha being wrong or misremembering but I am amused and entertained by the effort.Some questions for you . Were you troubled by the line at any time?. Or have you put all this thought into it because you feel others are troubled and you want to convince them that they shouldnt be?. Do you think the prosecution should have ignored the Im going to kill line or were they doing their jobs correctly when they called attention to it?. Do you think that stripped of that single line the rest of the note the contents of Haes letter and the defacement by Adnan and Aisha holds no meaning or importance to the case? That is do you think the only reason the letter was admitted into evidence and read by witnesses was because it happened to randomly have the words Im going to kill on it? . Since it was admitted and youre very familiar with it can you comment on how it colors your perceptions of Hae Adnan and Aisha?. Why do you think Christina objected so hard to it at trial?.

Conversely if he is bailed he is unlikely to accept an Alford plea and there will either need to be a retrial or the investigation reopened.

10216359,0,t1_dc21dm1,OK.  Lets break this down and see which scenario is more likely. A random killer randomly kills hae even though all signs point to it being someone she knew no forced entry no rape no robbery intimate way to be killed etc.. Then this killer just happens upon Jay tells him about the crime and tells him to pin it on someone else. Jay is scared and shocked when he discovers its one of his friends ex girlfriends a friend he coincidently spent most of that day with.  Instead of telling the police about this killer he pins it on his friend that may have an alibi for the time of the murder. The cell phone of adnan coincidently lines up with most of Jays story. No evidence is ever found to contradict Jays made up story besides minor time issues and to this day Jay is scared of the killer and still wont tell the truth. Or a guy had a girlfriend he loved. He betrayed hisfamily and religion for this girl. He was very close to both even told the girl she was a devil for making him betray his religion. The guys religion and family was a huge stress on a relationship that was already stressful because the guy was borderline stalker with the girl. The girl finds a new guy and dumps the guy with all the baggage. He is obviously upset. Tells a friend he is going to kill her. Writes on the breakup note from the girl Im going to kill. Then the girl goes missing on the day the ex asks for a ride  he didnt need. A witness comes forward and admits hes an accomplice gives information about the crime and where the victims car was located. His story is mostly corroborated by cell phone pings and witnesses that saw the two together throughout the day. Now which is more likely?,serialpodcast,dc22yje,9,t5_33vph

It would not be up to the person skeptical of that claim to disprove the possibility. In other words I dont see how XYZ couldnt have happened gets the burden of proof mixed up. If Jay is the killer is the argument then some plausible way for Jay to have intercepted Hae that is consistent with the known facts must be presented. And this is why I brought up the cell phone information. Yes Jay had time during the afternoon but time is not the only part of opportunity. We know roughly where he was when etc. gtDo we know Haes?Well we know she was at school until right around  and we know where she had to be right around .

You cannot read that diary and come away thinking that Hae was afraid of him she seems completely enamored with him for the most part and even when she moves on she really isnt worried about him. The controlling line is like ONE off comment in a text that is overall very favorable amp very positive towards Adnan. And as I said there is almost  consensus among their friends that their relationship and breakup was normal. The worst it gets was one or two people saying that he seemed over involved with her. Wow. What a monster.The thing about hiding from him the way that plays out in my mind is a teenage drama queen that didnt want to face him in the halls and was being playful  immature and telling a teacher she was hiding from him but not because he was a threat to her or anything. I mean come on how frightened of him could she really have been if he was the guy she called to come and help her out with her car trouble??? See what Im saying?

11200650,0,t1_df06hgn,gt even a potentially enforceable plea agreement could have a major effect on the outcome of the case.Yeahwere both making the same point about that.gt Here are a few practical observationsBasically I agree.  Id imagine the States plan would be.  Contact Jay in a matter of fact way.  Tell him that  pursuant to plea deal  they want to meet him to discuss his testimony and the practical arrangements for him coming to Baltimore for the trial.. If his response to the above contact makes it necessary ramp it up a bit.  Send a more threatening letter asserting that a refusal to assist would be a breach of the plea agreement and quoting the passages from that agreement which refer they say to consequences of breach.  They might well cite Ricketts to him as well..  If that still doesnt work then I assume the subpoena route would be next.  Ill leave it to others to comment on the details of the jurisdictional issues but ultimately its a murder trial and a high profile one at that and I imagine Maryland would be successful in getting what they need..  I think its unlikely that Jay would breach a court order.  Why would he?  .  If Jay did fail to attend then at that stage only  imho  might the State give serious consideration to the nuclear option of attempting to do to Wilds what the prosecution did to Adamson.  Its a very poor option for them imho. Firstly they might try and fail.  As discussed there are certain differences between Wilds situation and that of Adamson which give Jay a chance of winning. Secondly its one thing for the State to win a Ricketts argument and to charge Jay with murder.  Its a very different thing to actually convict him of it.  At most they have some or all of his prior statements and Jens evidence about  January .  But what else they got?  Even assuming that Jen does not tweak her account to be more helpful to Jay a big assumption in itself there does not seem enough to get a murder conviction.  Indeed would that evidence even meet the threshhold for a trial to start?  State may have a better option of sticking with the September  charge but asking for an increased sentence. Thirdly tactical and PR considerations would presumably play an important part.  On the one hand allowing Jay to get away with refusing to testify is something that the State might want to avoid.  That being said the State has  so far  put all its eggs in the basket The spine of Wilds account is basically correct.  Changing horses to Wilds and Syed did the killing together would make them look bad imho.  And that would be a hundred times worse if having done so they then failed to convict either Wilds or Syed.So in summary I do think that State will be able to get Wilds to testify in Trial  by telling him that he has no choice other than to cooperate.

11367544,0,t1_dfj47uy,My speculation is that Adnan had passing thoughts about harming Hae and over time those escalated. While smoking with Jay he vented to him about them and I dont think Jay ever took it seriously. I think Adnan probably made one last attempt to get back together with Hae and when rebuffed he acted out his fantasy. I dont know if he planned to kill her or sort of snapped in the moment. I am skeptical that Jay helped Adnan plan anything with Jay realizing Adnan was actually planning something that would really happen.,serialpodcast,dfkhmcb,3,t5_33vph

11380475,0,t1_dflleuc,The decision to hear the cell phone evidence is pretty interesting to me.  Given the abuse of discretion standard I think the defense probably wins on it though I wonder how the court will rule if it doesnt quite rise to abuse of discretion but they feel that they did not intend for Welch to hear evidence outside of the Asia claim.  From a tactical perspective Im somewhat surprised that the defense did not try to justify the decision to some degree in the states argument that they could have moved the timeline of the alibi had presented though its been a while that was the grounds on which JB originally filed the supplement to introduce the cell tower argument if Im recalling correctly a. It appeals to fairness IMO to say well if they are going to make this new timeline argument we should be allowed to counter that b maybe the cell tower argument could have been tied into assessing the prejudice of the IAC on the Asia claim?  Im spitballing here I guess theres really be no basis for that in the record as it existed prior to the hearing but c on the other hand maybe they shied away from the his argument since the location of incoming calls is pretty far afield from the states claim it could have shifted the CAGMC.How do you feel about calling the state out on quoting a part of a sentence pg ?  To me this seems like the type of thing that would bother a court especially since its their own order being quoted.I chuckled a little bit at the use of undaunted at page .What do you think about the second petition argument?In the states favor I am not sure that the knowingintelligent waiver standard is subject to clear error review cant the court apply judge Welchs factual findings and review de novo whether this would amount to a knowingintelligent waiver?  Assumingthey can I think this is probably an issue they would want to chime in on. I personally think the failure to challenge the reliability was IAC and while I like the argument that no consequence could have been more prejudicial than what occurred p  I think theres some danger to framing it this way as it suggests some sort of strategic considerations even if they were correctly balanced I dont actually think there were strategic considerations.I dont think theres too much surprise in the discussion of Asia.  ,serialpodcast,dflyhj2,2,t5_33vph

That would be something considered on a case by case basis. As I said previously I dont think John even comes close to this. This is a statement I am making from experience of having worked with people with far more severe degrees of mental ill health but that are still assessed as having the capacity to make such decisions. The bar is much lower than you seem to think it is... As long as someone understands the nature of the contract they are signing up for and can weigh it up and come to a decision on it then they are of sound mind. An example of not understanding might be that they cant remember the contents for long enough to be able to weigh the pros and cons as might happen in dementia or that they do not accept the premises of the contract as might happen in someone experiencing psychosis  e.g. a voice is telling them that the contract doesnt count or whatever.,serialpodcast,dfq1j8o,1,t5_33vph

I personally just dont believe the justice system worked as intended in the case. The amount of uncertainty that appears to be present is where I get conflicted myself. Theres so much going on in the case. The state didnt help me trust them in the way they conducted themselves either.

Those who totally believe Adnan is innocent will have no trouble believing he is innocent in spite of his potential guilty plea. And those who are truly undecided will likely remain undecided.

11790172,0,t1_dgwffbu,Ive obviously touched a nerve and I apologize. I cant understand your reaction or make sense of it but I didnt want to upset you and I can see that I have. This has nothing to do with anyones personal IPV experience or perspective. Urick characterized the case as run of the mill IPV and most guilters seem to as well so I ran with that phrase. Far from being dismissive myself of IPV which I fear you think I am being I am trying to call out the fact that it is rampant and epidemic. I believe IPV doesnt begin and end with murder. Most IPV does not end in murder. IPV is horrendous even when there are no lasting physical scars. And horrendously underreported and under punished. Thats a lame choice of words  under punished  but I am exhausted and at a loss. Too tired to come up with better and you know what I mean. Then you have people like Deirdre Enright who says things like thisgtWhen I read through your summary of your police notes I just kept going back to motive and thinking thats a big black hole for me. I still dont understand why you want this girl dead. Because she broke up with you? People break up with people all the time. Im a little concerned about racial profiling here you know?Which strikes me as extraordinarily naive misinformed insensitive and harmful. Because we have a real problem culturally with normalizing IPV and red flag behavior. I think we could save the lives of many women if we were more honest about IPV. I think maybe Hae could have been saved if there was better support for Adnan at home or in school or among his peers. Help for him to understand that to borrow Haes words his  life is NOT going to end. I dont think Adnans ego could handle it and I see that as stemming in part from the lack of good support he had. Violence against the woman he loved turned out to be the answer for him. Sarah Koenig saysgtAnd in her diary Hae never expresses any concerns about Adnans post breakup behavior.Which may technically true. But she expressed her concerns in the letter she wrote to Adnan. So Sarah too is guilty of the same thing as Deirdre. Minimizing our cause to be concerned about what was really going on. Spinning shit to cover up a real problem. I hate her for it. I really do. If we cant talk honestly about IPV how can we ever make it go away how will we ever be able to save women like Hae?Indirectly anyone who tries to downplay Adnans motive is harming women. I really feel that way. Yet the idea that Adnan could not have been just like the thousands of men who hurt women because their egos have been bruised gains traction around here. Somehow Adnan is different and unique.I hate that I may have upset you. I wish you peace and feel terrible if Ive robbed you of it today. I am exhausted myself now and have to be done. I hope youll forgive me.,serialpodcast,dgwgexv,1,t5_33vph
