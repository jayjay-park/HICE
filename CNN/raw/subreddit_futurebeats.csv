1103743,0,t1_chtisfa,gtName another advert for glue.I dont need to.  Superglue and Gorillaglue are household names because theyve established themselves as the de facto standard of strong glue much like Kleenex has for face tissue.  Their brand names are synonymous with the product itself.  This commercial doesnt put them heads and shoulders above the competition much less even on the same playing field.  Marketing  would inform you that especially when entering a competitive market with largely established players you need to differentiate your product somehow  via benefits cost whatever.  Youre not going to get by with a quirky commercial of fat people dancing the entirety of which I thought was an advert for fanny packs and then promptly stopped paying attention.  By the way I still have no idea what the actual brand name of this glue was and I refuse to go back and look simply to spite you.  Maybe this company does have a better marketing plan in place and this was simply a one off trial piece but I would be hard pressed to imagine theyll still be in business in  years.,futurebeats,chtr32t,1,t5_2ro3c

2071880,0,t3_2ilfvv,Personally I dont think its exhausting. I go through waves of listening to a certain genre artist for a bit while playing that with other already established tracks that I love then repeating it every so often with a new artist or album. As long as I dont overplay the album for like a month straight I feel like I can revisit it later and still enjoy it. Hell I recommend lingering on an artist or genre you like for some time and really get to hear all the little intricacies that you just wont pick up on one cursory listen. Honestly Im lucky to have the time to be able to listen to music when studying working out or just chilling with friends so thats not really a factor for me.I find the easiest way is to just listen to mixes from your favorite artists. Pretty much every single producer will eventually make a mix for a radio show or for a live set like Boiler Room and post it online. Chances are that if you enjoy the artists music you will also enjoy what the artist likes listening to as well. Even if you dont love every single track if the mix is decent youll only have to deal with it for a minute or two before the next track enters in. As for this sub there is a lot of good stuff that people dont pick up on for whatever reason which does kind of suck. But I still recommend just listening to a couple tracks on the new queue every so often and voting on them as there are some really nice tracks and remixes that dont get as much attention as they deserve.,futurebeats,cl36jlb,7,t5_2ro3c

I track down mixes tweets etc by the same artist his friends label mates etc  do a lot of scrubbing and crying. It takes a level of insight about the artist to guess who else could possibly have this track and where would it manifest itself online but then its a lot of manual labor.Ive managed to automate most of this process now using scraping and audio fingerprinting  Im actually building a datamapping layer and decentralized protocol that unifies the musical internet amp allows for artists to frictionlessly distribute their music... this should fix most of the struggle.,futurebeats,cl4qow0,1,t5_2ro3c

2829047,0,t3_2shnzn,Well the futurebeats movement was most prominent from  when artists were becoming more creative in making hiphopinfluenced beats and instrumental music. But since then the movement has come a long way even if it isnt as thriving.    Now the whole point of futurebeats is that there isnt really a clearly defined boundary. Its just the idea of composing sounds and sonic patterns in ways that nobody else has rather than deliberately creating music that will fall directly into a specific genre.    Darkside is sweet though. They have more of a discodeephouse style. For another example Flying Lotus uses a hiphop style. Then there are artists like Aphex Twin that take influence from jungle and drum n bass. Even though all of these futurebeats artists make music that could be classified into different genres they all make incredibly unique music that can be easily identified as each artists own soundstyle. That originality in electronic music is the basic idea of futurebeats.,futurebeats,cnpnon1,3,t5_2ro3c

Hes been doing his own edits manually since at least  and probably this track Dynamic Symmetry and the whole album was created using early builds of Stutter Edit before it was released.Credits   Credits My favorite album of his is Movement In Still Life.,futurebeats,co4uu5c,2,t5_2ro3c

8717820,0,t1_d6vc3et,Not sure what sort of critique youre after but generally I like the overall sound of the track it sounds fresh and clean use of vocal samples bring the pace up in the second half of the track which works nicely. Only thing Id say is that I would maybe shorten the track by tweaking the arrangement slightly. I wouldnt worry about your production style though just focus on doing what you want to do and keep developing your sound. Nice sounds and atmosphere. ,futurebeats,d6vd7sl,1,t5_2ro3c

11017146,0,t1_degncjv,No problem  if youre into this vibe you might be interested in a lot of the music being put out on Rhythm Section a Peckham based label run by Bradley Zero. He pushes that sound pretty hard and spends a lot of time in Aus.  Hes also one of the original boiler room crew and recently threw this event in Melbourne. Does a great biweekly show on NTS radio as well. If youre new to the label check out the Silent Jay X Jace XL EP. You can find their releases here. ,futurebeats,degrgzo,3,t5_2ro3c

Too Future is future bass this sub seems to be more abstract electronic based.I would recommend going to rtrap and rEDM because you will find more music that fits your taste here. Although I would recommend staying on this sub too because great music is posted here all the time.Hope this helped ,futurebeats,dgd3tu6,32,t5_2ro3c
