6780140,0,t1_d0c86x8,Hi Thibeau! Apologies for the late reply but here it is.  Concerning your question on time on  Cancri e  Cancri e has an orbit time of . days. In other words it orbits the star in about . hours. When a year passes on planet Earth therefore   Cancri e years pass by!The phenomenon of the diamond interior is as follows Diamonds are formed under conditions of extreme pressure and extreme temperatures. This planet is at a VERY high temperature  kelvin degrees and has a radius twice the radius of Earth and a mass  times that of Earth.  Cancri e is the only identified planet until now with such a high proportion of carbon. This combined with the high temperatures the mass and radius of the planet make the formation of diamonds possible in very thick layers. I hope this answered both questions! ,esa,d0kta3s,2,t5_2tczb
