56832,0,t1_cegymhv,We might be talking about the same zone.I do ride with a power meter.  My FTP is somewhere between .   is what I call tempo.  If flat and solo avg speed somewhere around mph.  My TT heart rate is  and good tempo pace puts me in the mid s.  I love this zone because its fast but not horribly painful.  For me Zrecovery takes concentration to stay mellow and Ztempo takes concentration to keep on the gas.  Z also requires a lot of concentration to keep going too but the difference to me is in Z Im counting each and every minute before I can stop the effort whereas Z I know I can hold albeit uncomfortably for any reasonable length road ride hrs if need be.  Fatigue accumulating in Z for me makes me less able to respond to changes of speed  basically the more I use Z the less I can use even temporarily power from Z or above.Maybe the zone I like is called sweet spot training I dont know.  I like to ride without structure and going fast and hammering is its own reward regardless of whether its good training or not.,Velo,cekwfgk,2,t5_2s4ji

639858,0,t3_21crha,Interesting article and it really does the job of putting the fundamental concept in black and white terms. Personal opinion here take it as you will. I was thinking and reading up about the whole nature of intervals especially aerobic vs anaerobic and the simple reality is that it all is based on the utilization of oxygen by the working muscles. We can measure blood lactate heart rate Vomax and we can measure power but what if we could measure muscular oxygenation levels during exerciseSt or Sm?I dug around and found some emerging field usable tech that does just that and my guess is that a few years devices such as these will be as common as heart rate monitors and powermeters are today. Instead of basing your training on your self congratulatory FTP which you tested on a powermeter that may or may not be consistently accurate and basing workouts off a chart in a book... youll be working to reach oxygenation levels and comparing the wattage per interval it takes to reach it and how quickly you recover from those intervals. ,Velo,cgd03lk,1,t5_2s4ji

Last race about  weeks ago I got dropped about halfway through and my TT times havent been spectacular so I wasnt expecting much.The race was an Australian pursuit and I was in the middle group of . The course was short km but with a steep uphill finish.Our group worked well together and I was taking my pulls but never very long or very hard. As we were coming up to the finish there were a few digs from other guys on small hills but I let other people close them down. about m from the bottom of the hill I was third wheel and the two guys on the front were chatting with each other and not pushing the pace so I launched an attack hoping to bring at least one other person with me. However no one caught my wheel and when I looked back it was a guy from the same shop as me not official teammates chasing me down. So rather than blowing up pushing too hard solo I waited up for him and we started swapping pulls up the climb and bringing out the gap. About m from the finish I put in a dig and got about  bike lengths. When I looked back he had a major pain face but was accelerating. In the last m he blew past me and I couldnt hold his wheel.So we didnt catch the group ahead and the group behind didnt catch us but I got nd in my group so Im pretty stoked with that result. Im still not sure whether or not I should have just kept pushing on solo or waited.

When I got back on the bike I was in a miserable state like I had recently started cycing. This was a combination of the sickness and a side effect of the antibiotics some of them as in my case are causing fatigue. I suspect inactivity was the leas of the reasons. It took me another month to recover from the effects of the sickness and the medication and be able to get to a reasonable training schedule again. Once I got back to a routine I improved very fast and it was feeling very good despite been in the middle of the winter. Two months later I got above my presickness levels which was very exciting and actually shows that the years of riding were still there Of course in your case it may be very different e.g. milder sickness and non fatigue causing medication. But if you feel fatigued it is normal and temporary and it will go away soon. As people rightly said go slower for a bit enjoy the scenery and maybe do more social riding.,Velo,cixunff,2,t5_2s4ji

It was just a few weeks ago when I was riding through Barrington Hills in spandex.  I saw this little old lady maybe  years old working in her yard trimming hedges.  I took my water bottle and threw it at her.  Of course she fell over and and broke her hip.  About that time a driver came up and started yelling at me.  I dragged him out of the car took my ULock and smashed his teeth in.

Youre asking a very niche question that not many people are going to have personal experience with so have realistic expectations and only expect a couple answers.  Theres this really obvious and obnoxious trend for people once they get to Cat  to think theyre all that and lose touch with the fact that other riders are people.

4088715,0,t1_crmbhkj,Ive been using my edge  and HRM on my turbo since mid March and thats buckets of sweat. I drape a towel over the top tube and one over the handlebars that I use to mop my brow when my eyes sting. I want to see the edge so it gets sweat dripping on on it although I wipe it away occasionally. So far without issues. I imagine Im not alone in that usage scenario.Similarly for the HRM typically my cycling gear is dryer coming out the washing machine than it was going in.I note the HRM seems reliable enough once your heart rate is in  digits. Its a bit onoff below that especially if youre moving around. Theres the occasional parts of my rides where something is interfering and itll read  for a few seconds. On rides I repeat these spikes are in the same place so it must be power lines cell towers or something.I note that my heart rate is not particularly stable even when I think it should be. I can sit on the turbo at  watts ish heart rate and it can rise to  for a minute and then drop back down. Because Im on a trainer with constant resistance  cadence etc I know my effort hasnt changed.If I was trying to ride to HR on varying terrain itd be sheesh I must be going too hard so I do wonder if some of the complaints about the HR figure is just down to the heart being measured rather than the HRM. I have seen someone complain about his heart rate data fluctuating wildy on garmins forums and when I looked at his garmin connect data it was going up when he went uphill and dropping on the descent. Im not sure what he expected his HR graph to look like.Not saying the OPs HRM arent becoming faulty. My instinct would be to consider whether its the collection of data or its transmission thats producing these erratic results. How susceptible is ANT to interference from a phones wifi signal or other .ghz stuff? Maybe he doesnt disable his phones wifi and its constantly looking for base stations during rides and interfering?,Velo,crmc6wq,1,t5_2s4ji

Lets define acceleration as change in velocity high school FTW. While youre in the middle section of a flat turn your vertical velocity is zero can we ignore turning in for a brief moment?.  Sustained zero velocity means zero acceleration.  Zero net force.  Gravity down equals normal force up.  Newtons rd says that in order to push down harder youd have to push something else up.

As a guideline you would perform min Intervals at about  of CP FTP and min around  and you would do them twice a week at the start of your winter training as part of min long trainings instead of longer moderate sessions. ,Velo,cvr4aaz,1,t5_2s4ji

But yes you can maintain fitness and build fitness largely on rollerstrainer using structured intervals but for the most part for someone racing for the first time that would be overkill.My overarching advice to you for getting started is to just jump in. Dont worry about winning about being good. Focus on improving skills each race learning how to read a race predict the attacks before they come know when the pack is going to accelerate and then work on finishing the race. Beyond all just do it and have fun. Seriously dont think about it to much. I got dropped in my first  races I lasted longer each time. I raced into fitness I learned about cornering about where to be in the pack and I won a race by the end of my first year of bike racing.

Its very difficult to run scientific studies on food and so we have to rely on case studies or even anecdotes. This is true of other health factors besides just weight loss. Food is voodoo in the scientific world.There is lots of case evidence for the effectiveness of HFLC in relation to weight loss in nonendurance athletes but whether that can applied to endurance athletes is really difficult to say. There are a few proponents in the cycling community but I forget their names Phinney sr. May be one of the iirc. Im on mobile or Id send you a few links.The bottom line is that the best advice is still probably to track your eating habits and pick out some easy candidates for removal.

If your power measurement is correct you have the legs to absolutely shred the lower cats as soon as the road turns up so the races youre likely to be better at are probably not going to be crits.  hrs a week is probably not going to cut it when youre doing  mi road races.The group rides are there to teach you how to ride draft attack everything that training by yourself cant. And dont always hide in the back and wait for the sprint be aggressive make attacks that have next to no chance of succeeding get a feel for how the pack chases and sits up practice chasing and pulling through basically try to recreate different aspects of racing.Lastly race as much as you can.

7231461,0,t3_4ehfeh,Its all about intensity. Sure I have friends who put in way more miles than I do. But when Im out on that  mile ride working on my endurance Im also working on my intensity by pushing my limits up each climb or throwing in a few  minute tempo or threshold efforts.If youre just starting out I would recommend a heart rate monitor. I started with that and keeping my HR above a specific limit for intervals. Now I train with power which is much more accurate.If youre specifically losing out on short burst efforts in races then I would suggest either short climb hill repeats like less than min efforts or like the redditor earlier mentioned  second intervals.

Both your situation and my situation are in a slightly different context though since the article is written about someone who was cheating and bumping people off of Kona qualification slots the IM world championship. Kona is considered the triathletes Mecca if you will so that is why its been taken so seriously. So not only did she take first place but then she robbed someone of their chance at the world championship. Ironically the accused triathlete did not do so well when competing in courses that were setup in a way that cutting the course was not really possible. What Im surprised at is that no one has commented on the Kip Litton who fabricated entire races by setting up a fake website posting fake results where he won and even setting up a fake directors email.

8151289,0,t3_4qwmjf,It really depends what specifically you are looking for there are at least  main types of crit in the UKThere are lots of circuit races here in the UK on dedicated circuits. A few off the top of my head Steven Burke circuit Colne Yorks Sports Village cycle circuit Salt Ayre lancaster Tameside greater manchester Lee Valley London Litherland Liverpool and loads more. In the summer there will generally be a race on each circuit and generally there might be a race on at the weekend too. The ones I am familiar with will have a womens specific races every other week simply due to lower numbers but will let women race in the  amp cat races too.Then there are longer races that are around motor circuits like Oulton Park amp Darley Moor and no doubt many more. I much prefer these to circuit races are whilst there are dead corners youll also have some straights to stretch your legs or even sit in.Finally there are City Centre races these usually happen once or twice a year in each location. They generally draw real crowds unlikely a rainy day at motor circuit haha. The ones that comes to mind are Shrewsbury Horwich Otley amp Colne although there are many more too. These almost always have a dedicated women race too.There are two main racing bodies in the UK for our age group TLI and British Cycling. TLI is much more casual and there is less drive to put on womens races  however for crits TLI races will let you get a day license for like a fiver. So you dont need to fork out for the full license to only do a couple of races.British Cycling on the hand is the fully UCI affiliated racing body in the UK. This is the body that will keep tab of your points and what category you are.A list of crits amp circuit race can be found herePlease note will either need to be BC member WITH a race license which is costly TBH or you need to ensure you are allowed to get a day license  and I think many races dont even have to facilities to give out day licenses so Id contact the organiser before hand if you intend to go that route.Finally dont overthink it just get stuck in! And to be honest if you enter a womens only race then the races are much less needlesslyaggressive and take the corners much more smoothly than the choas that is a men  crit haha.Happy to try and answer any more specific question you might have.,Velo,d4wgiz6,7,t5_2s4ji

If you can float it I would pay the up front money for the second bike.  In five years you would be at the break even point and during that time you can make a judgment about which bike to use in races based on your risk perception.  If it goes badly you have a spare.A spare bike is immensely helpful while one is being serviced.  You can also put one on the trainer for longer durations during the winter.

But very much depends on your age and most of them developped during age . Can be developped above  only marginal.

So if you build a solid aerobic endurance w cycling it will impact  to central staff lungheart and majority  sport specific working muscles.

Youre at the mercy of the zwifttrainerroad dev teams and how they interpret the power curve if you want identical power.Couple this with manufacturing tolerances and the unit you have might not even match up with what zwiftTR have recorded as the known power curve.Your best bet is to only use one program. Whether the number says  or  the best you can hope for is that this number will be consistent between multiple training sessions so that youre comparing apples to apples.Ideally you can get a power meter and test to see how accurate their zpowervirtual power compare to actual power but I bet youll find that both trainers are off.Still it should be consistently accurate within  which is accurate enough to still get the proper training adaptations you need.,Velo,dbpwm3a,1,t5_2s4ji

Id say its better to have it too high than too low.At the end of the day the zones are ranges with an amount of overlap between them. If you try to do a x at FTP and only hit  of your overinflated FTP dont worry about it too much. Its not like theres some magical switch in your body that gets flipped when you hit exactly . Its all a sliding scale.Obviously in an ideal situation youd always have a true and accurate FTP number but its not the end of the world. Its important to understand your body and be able to make adjustments based on that. If your next few workouts are impossibly hard with this FTP maybe drop it  watts and use that estimate until its time to retest. ,Velo,ddehcy2,6,t5_2s4ji

10820169,0,t1_ddv18of,When I upgraded to  I was doing max power  sustained w sprints  kg.Im short on the bike okay but those power numbers are not very high. In my important sprints I was often putting down less power. In that  race my peak wattage was w and I hit it on the second straight of the race. I dont have my power numbers in front of me but I think I did a w peak and sustained w sprint in that race.Also my last win I barely broke w in the last s and won by a huge margin. I was super fit for me  FTP w weight about  kg this is April . Absolutely flying for me.Thing about the spring races is that Im the promoter in many of my race clips as well as a racer so after late night of scrambling to get things ready I get onsite maybe  AM work the race outdoors in coldchilly weather until a few minutes before the race at  PM get on the bike only long enough to roll to the startfinish from the registration area typically  second warm up like in  and more like walk the bike  feet in  and then raced. Ive bonked in races because I hadnt eaten much at the race sometimes almost nothing between  AM and race time at .For me theres one overriding reason I can race at low FTP low avg wattage drafting.Everyone notices about me is that I ride along like Im glued to the rider in front of me. Doesnt matter where I am in the field. I struggled immensely when I first started racing. I learned I could sprint so I just hoped to get to the finish. I realized that if I spent any amount of time in the wind Id cook myself for the next  or  minutes and I often found myself redlined at the bell and simply unable to accelerate when it came down to the sprint. Therefore I made it my goal to see less than  seconds of wind until the bell lap.LESS THAN  SECONDS OF WIND UNTIL THE BELL. Usually in a  mile race.So that was my goal. If I had to move up I tried to move up inside the field. If I had to move up on the outside I did so in tailwinds or crosswinds and I chose the protected side. Id start counting if I hit wind one two three four... and I gave myself five  second moveups in a race. Id just stop pedaling if I ran out of time and tucked back in where ever I could tuck back in.Even if youre not a sprinter this thought applies. You should see ZERO wind until you make your move. You soloed last week for  laps and got caught? Then go at . laps to go. And do absolutely nothing until you make your move. Be bored out of your skull. Sit next to me at the back of the field. Start coasting as early as possible before the corners where its possible. You may find yourself so relaxed your HR drops into the s. This is great except you may have to warm up again before you make your big move.Shelter gt TrainingIf I wasnt in a situation where I was making a big move then I wasnt in the wind. Even in that  clip when I make a monster move on the hill Im trying to stay close to others. Its only when I get to the front and bridge the gap that I am in the wind and frankly it absolutely annihilated me. I was incapable of making any kind of move for a couple laps and I thought Id thrown the race away.On the other hand when I was on Cliffs wheel in the leadout my HR DROPPED  bpm. I was resting and recovering at  mph while everyone else was scrambling for wheels I heard from a few people there was a big scramble to get on my wheel. So they were fighting riding in the wind and I was soft pedaling and catching my breath. I was redlined when I got on his wheel  bpm Id have a very short sprint at that HR. When I jumped I was at  bpm much better for me and I did a pretty longforme sprint. Among the riders I passed were a multitime national crittrack champion and a future pro crossdomesticroad racer. And remember that was an w jump and sustained w sprint.I avg w for that race. Cliff avg w.You can do it. All of you can do it. Just adjust your racing a bit. Expend w avg less and suddenly those race end moves become much more possible.,Velo,ddw0vm6,8,t5_2s4ji

11418868,0,t3_62zniu,Stronger rider should burden the most effort weaker rider is best on the front on easier sections when the speed will be higher across all riders so differences in speed arent likely to result in as large differences in time. Weaker rider could lead into the turn if theyll be able to carry speed a lot better than rider  so less exertion on their part coming out of the corner.Is there anywhere you can practice local to you? Id go out and spend a couple of hours trying different things and going two mock efforts if you can  no need to carry on if things break up pull over for a chat and then have another go with improvements.Ive got a up TTT in the summer and Ive done a lot of paceline riding with the other riders over the winter everyone pulling as hard as they can and anyone feeling weaker pulling off immediately or after a reduced turn while maintaining the same pace.,Velo,dfqbf6l,4,t5_2s4ji

11459188,0,t3_63ivv4,I have had it and I get vocal. Nice day for a fondo eh! Etc. I can often drum up a counter attack of  more guys to bridge. It all depends on level of racing.If there are teammates left in the peloton expect them to disrupt or not pull through. If you have friends or teammates I recommend working together. A  min gap is big but not insurmountable with a couple guys and enough time left to race. ,Velo,dfuw3i3,3,t5_2s4ji

11556887,0,t3_64ympx,I usually end up just having to buy one or two sizes larger in the waist. Part of it is that I dont feel like spending money on clothes and just end up buying s wherever theyre the cheapest. They still fit well everywhere else and I wear a belt most of the time anyways.I know there are companies like Keirin Cut jeans whove spammed on here before and Gongshow tailored towards Hockey players who apparently have the same issues all of their stuff is so expensive though.

11724994,0,t1_dgp1y6h,Yup knew a few riders looking for a good result on that one and all of them just sat up rather than get involved in the danger of a m  man sprint. Luckily race leaders finished about s ahead of the bunch so the podium wasnt affected but if they were looking for points it was a right cockup.Also last year Scotlands latest great hope John Archibald was DQd in a race because a member of his team briefly drove in the race convoy without his noticing. He won and was immediately DQd. Hed have gotten his Cat from that result. There was some amount of outrage over that. Of course hes superhuman so he took his Cat with gusto in a stage race a few weeks after.,Velo,dgp246i,3,t5_2s4ji
