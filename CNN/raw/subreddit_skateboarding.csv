From a liability standpoint the owner is responsible if dumb Jimmy breaks his leg and his parents are looking for someone to sue.If you really want a successful place to skate figure out how to protect other peopleparties from lawsuits.

801987,0,t3_23awkx,Surprised your dentist didnt tell you this or maybe they did but wisdom teeth are pretty structurally integral to your jaw bone. Once you have them out your jaw will be weaker than usual until the areas where the roots of the wisdom teeth once were are refilled in with bone. It takes  months to completely heal but becomes pretty solid before then.By the end of it your jaw will be totally back to normal but no contact sports for  weeks is the general rule.

Put your board beside a large curb or another elevated flat surface and try to Ollie onto it.

1199205,0,t3_27ud80,Finding youre style is a lot like finding out which sexual fetishes you can get into. You first have to realize that you skate for you. You need to understand that a skaters style is really just the genre of skating that is the most fun for that skater. You dont masturbate to something because you think it looks cool you do it because thats what feels right. Once you get past learning the basic tricks ollie s kickflips heelfips etc. you can choose to only skate what you want to do. That doesnt mean you shouldnt push yourself but it means that if a certain form of skating frustrates or doesnt seem fun dont do it.Using myself as an example I have always been frustrated skating stair sets. The repetitive slams and inconsistency really got to me. I thought that if I got good at them they would be fun. So I skated them all the time. Always coming home broken and frustrated I stopped skating. Now just getting back into it I focus mainly on ledges miniramps and goofy flatground tricks. After months of skating I have had the most fun yet and honestly have not been frustrated at all. Back on topic if you focus on having fun your skills and style will progress at a much faster rate than if you were skating what you want your style to look liketldr Be you skate what you want to skate and style will come   ,skateboarding,ci4j1x4,10,t5_2qig3

The purple and green color thing isnt cool looking the random shots of other people arent interesting and it looks like youre trying too hard to make it like a Baker video or something. And you included stuff that just makes you guys look like dumbasses for example you got asked to leave a church I think thats what it is and decided to try and be badass and flick off the dude who wasnt even a security guard or authority figure. And no one wants to see bails of flatground tricks thats just embarrassing. As I said the skating is alright and youre better than I am but if youre making a video at this skill level you need to include some more quality footage of you simply skating instead of hijinks and stuff. And if you want to make a hijinks video and I definitely dont blame you hijinks videos are fun to make and watch just show it to friends who will actually find it funny.  ,skateboarding,ci7ufdw,3,t5_2qig3

1713133,0,t3_2e0eoe,Skateboarding is highly misunderstood unfortunately. Non skaters see architecture and think oh that looks beautiful. We see architecture and decide if and how can we skate it. Our perception of beauty is different and that is where the problem lies. Ill post an excerpt from a transworld article I read a couple of years ago that I feel is applicable to this discussion. gtSkate spots are rarely in ideal locales. Sometimes theyre under the watchful eye of security guards. Sometimes theyre within earshot of slumbering senior citizens and occasionally theyre in economically disadvantaged and predominately black neighborhoods. This isnt necessarily a problem but if the spot is itself a monument to fallen black leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. then erere bound to be some residents who view the inevitable scuffing that results from skateboarding as an insult to the memory of this undeniably great man.gtA motorist got out of his car to yell at Matt for riding on one of the huge marble monoliths. The man was so hurt. He kept yelling Dont disrespect us like that! I felt really bad. I wanted to talk with the guy so he at least understood that the apparent irreverence was unintentional but he got back in his car and drove off. Matt was put off and didnt want to skate anymore. I look at it this way at least the monument isnt a forgotten relic. I cant think of what else would bring a bunch of mostly white kids into that part of town to read the inspirational words engraved in the marble. But then its pretty easy to skateboard wherever you please and then justify it to yourself after the fact.Source ,skateboarding,cjv3pd2,4,t5_2qig3

1824505,0,t1_ck8riot,Yeah you got the idea Im not that advanced in sketchup and I didnt know exactly how to fill that area in. The more things you put the more concrete you need the more space etc. In the original sketch the open space served for speed to hit the quarter pipe. Plus you could bring in a rail to skate or have an open space to play skate in. My original idea with this plan is to create small spots that could be integrated at minimal cost and could be built in a short amount of time. Im working on making small skate bowls too that fit the same amount of space.Using this method a city wouldnt have to wait multiple years to fund one massive skate park but could build small spots and add more as more funding came around. EDIT also another advantage of this is that the land needed to build is much smaller and could be incorporated into existing parks much easier than a very large facility. ,skateboarding,ck91jys,1,t5_2qig3

1832248,0,t3_2fhotd,Ive always had success even with a  longboard just by moving confidently and making sure you get it stowed on the plane as soon as you can. Its especially nice if you have a window seat you can just wedge it between the seat and fuselage. Otherwise just take the trucks off and put me in your backpack. They dont want to go through the hassle of checking just a deck at the gate or when on the plane. Probably much easier to negotiate if they stop you for it.

Most people hear corporate and jump on Nike and Adidas but forget that Emerica is just as corporate.  Its an image thing though because Nike and Adidas came into skateboarding recently whereas Converse basically did the same exact thing years earlier.  Where would we be without the Air  Dunks?  Or the Shelltoe?  These kids are so ready to get all pissed about corporations while they listen to their ipods and post their skate clips on instagram but they lack historical perspective.

Buy trucks that are as wide as your board. Wheels go for something a little bigger like mm ish. Startout just pushing around the street. Ride up and down curb cuts learn to balance on the board.

1933829,0,t1_ckl35ws,As a former college track and field athlete I recommend box jumps whole heartedly and would add other plyometrics as well. The mechanics of an Ollie are a little different than straight on vertical jumping so you may want to try to include side to side jumps as well. I could also see some hurdle drills helping with this as well they improve flexibility and fast twitch muscle response.

They were used for sliding the lacquer starved pool coping and unwaxed cement of the world we used to live in.

Also this is the first place I have ever racked myself I tried board sliding the rail by the box and wacked my balls on the end of it.  I was there really early in the morning so no one was there to see it or help me.  So after rolling around on the ground in pain for  minutes I got up and started driving back to the hotel and about half way there I had to pull over to the side of the road to throw up.   would nut myself in Durham again.,skateboarding,cqbcvi5,2,t5_2qig3

Im in my mid s now and recently got back into skateboarding because I started dating someone near an excellent park. I had forgotten how much I missed it and now Im back. That was about  months ago.It took me about a week to get back to dropping in and about a month to get back to my ollie. Im a LOT bigger than I was back in the day but Im also a lot more durable. Ive taken insane slams with less equipment than I used when I was a kid and walked away with nothing more than a week long swellbow. Im more confident in myself but at the same time more cautious. Ive got a good group of guys I skate regularly with and thats really what I love the most skating with people I look up to and want to emulate and also just enjoying the ride.The less I care about progression the more I progress.,skateboarding,cql0up0,5,t5_2qig3

But too many parents dont understand that the skatepark is still a dangerous place.  They take pics as little Tony Hawk rolls right in front of someone going mph eyes on the camera. Or they let their yo roll around on his belly in the streetcourse. All I can envision is a board shooting out across the park and straight into littlebros face. And thats just the kids on boards and the dreaded scootards. Then their are kids like this playing soccer or just sliding down the banks. Then there was the time some kids got in a water fight right at the top of the step up and eight stair and mommy got very upset when we told her to stop them. Park is a year old and still buffed to a sheen. A single drop of water is instant death to any unlucky enough to cross it.,skateboarding,crd9lmm,2,t5_2qig3

But like every other skater out there you push through it or ignore it or whatever. I literally waited a year to get my leg checked out waited until I couldnt even walk. It had advanced super far by then so I had to get a full knee replacement and Im missing virtually all the muscle in the area and my entire femur. Its physically impossible for me to get the pop since I ride goofy and the surgery was my left leg. Its crazy I know we all think how much we love skateboarding and cant imagine life without it and Im here to tell you its worse than I ever imagined.

5377950,0,t1_cvyj2k4,First off I just want to say Im not trying to be a dick. I just honestly feel it hurts skateboarding more than it helpsThe biggest part of skateboarding that I like is the people that are a part of it especially back when I started skating  years ago. Because skateboarding was somewhat still taboo not mainstream not competitive and making any money off of it was super difficult the people drawn to it tended to be creative simply wanting to skate and that was their only motivation. The competitive form of skating at the time was in the form of going hard people like TNT there was no real competition with other skaters only competing with yourself to get better. While a lot of companies still have people with these ethics Ive seen these people become harder and harder to find as the years pass and money and competitions have become more norm. I think a lot of people think just riding a board is fun and thats great but one of my favorite things in skating beyond just being on board is the people that arent scared of being out of place different and doing their own things. I would prefer we continue to foster a sport where these people are drawn considering I think people like that can gain so much more from skating than other organized often less individually creative sports in the same way that I have seen my entire life shaped by skateboarding unlike other sports I participated in even through college like soccer and track and we can let the competitiveness in sports where it is naturally built in. By adding more highlevel competition where people are told to compete for their country and not just for skateboarding I feel like we will continue to attract people who in the same way they are drawn to other less creative outlets will be drawn to skateboarding not because they saw their friends older brother do a steezy kickflip on their driveway for the first time or were in awe of his style on a front nose bigspin out but because they are in awe of the persona of some rich guy on tv who loves the throes of competition. In the end I want to keep skateboarding about skateboarding and I dont feel like global competition adds to that in any way because people that will be drawn to it have no need to see anything more than a backside tail or tre flip. ,skateboarding,cvz3dtq,3,t5_2qig3

MM at least! maybe even up to mm   might be a sweet spot but that depends on you!  if you go up to the high s youll need risers so you dont have to ride on tight ass trucks..i mean you could also potentially get harder wheels but theyd need to be a bit bigger to roll over the bumps... itll still be a gnarly bumpy ride though... if youre just getting started it can be tough to set up to learn tricks on rough ground.good luck to you!,skateboarding,d09vo9r,1,t5_2qig3

7001296,0,t1_d19vdb9,The money should have been distributed better thats definitely fair. But even the more laidback style productions like robot food and think thank have always had ridiculous jumpbackcountry shots. Thats what made those videos so appealing one shot theyd be hitting some nutty  foot backcountry booter that you can only dream of and next shot they would be dicking around on a picnic table in a park. I guess maybe today those kind of shots arent quite as prevalent. But I think it mostly depends on the production company there were plenty of lame videos with nothing but jumps and pipe footage from the robot food era too. I can understand the criticism for foam pits its annoying to see kids doing double corks that couldnt lipslipde a street rail to save their life. Finally for some perspective before you go thinking im the gymnastflippyspinny type or a pipe jock or something... Im a lil rail nut from MN that grew up watching think thank videos religiously.

Skate culture is dictated by skaters already.  It doesnt matter who is making the products skaters use because theyre selling into that market and therefore have to answer to it.

8281882,0,t1_d5cr0sh,ight real talk getting a cruiser is cool but dude just get a feel for your board those first few years are so pivotal in developing all your muscle memory for when you get good. so much of skateboarding is feeling. can you feel your board? do you feel the spot? do you feel the trick? its all a mental process that you get from confidence in knowing where your foot is gonna be at the right time. you can take it to rails and to sets and transition and dont get discouraged i didnt do anything super noteworthy my first year despite trying super hard EVERY day. But after i got over a few mental humps you just start understanding what you have to do with your body to get the right result.

8325152,0,t3_4tklgr,Both spraypaint and paint pens work great  griptape will fuck up your paint pens over time    full decks worth of detailed work.Highly recommend the following route  take the time to cut out what you want as a stencil spray it on and let it dry. Then use paint pen to either shadeadd depth or simply outline what youve done in spraypaint. My favorite color combo for this is bright blue stencilhot pink paint pen detail and that is after many different combinations tried out. Just looks really good on black gripHOWEVER I would refrain from painting too much where your front foot does its ollie kickflip and heelflip manuevers. I have found that even a small amount of painted area here can actually make a negative difference over time. As such I try to focus most of the work towards the tail lessening the impact as you go up towards the nose. Adorining my board with images and characters is a fucking great time and Ill be honest  makes me skate better. You can say thats just hokey pokey and Ill not disagree but I feel like just the time I put into spending with a new deck imbibing it with shamanistic power ha really makes me feel more connected to it. IDK. Seriously recommend having fun with this though!!! PM me if you have any questions but its pretty straighforward so good luck!,skateboarding,d5i767j,2,t5_2qig3

8537990,0,t3_4woyi5,There is a huge difference between . inches and . inches when it comes to decks if you have big feet Id suggest a wider board.Turning has to do with the trucks the axles that hold the wheels and how tight they are.  You adjust the tightness by tightening the kingpin the big nutbolt combo in the center of the axle..  now we could get into how soft or hard your bushings are but these are all reasons why you go to a local skate shop and not Walmart to get a board! The dudes at a local shop will be happy to show you how to make these adjustments yourself and find whats comfortable!I hope this didnt sound condescending because Im honestly trying to be helpful.

9704473,0,t1_da8qciu,If youre okay to wait with ordering online check out these socks! They have built in shin guards and ankle guards which really help. I remember when I was  months in I was learning flip tricks and I always used to swing by board straight into my shin. They were always hurting. My ankles still get jabbed by the board to this day. Get him some of these! The company that makes those is called fp or footprint insoles also makes amazing foot insoles which I love.A FEW MORE SUGGESTIONSIf you dont have time to wait go to a local skate shop search on yelp and see if they got any cool hoodies or something. Anything that looks like a good art style for him would be nice. Its getting cold and its nice to stay warm yet rep who you are.  Keep in mind some skate shop clothes are a bit more expensive than normal hoodies you find so thats something to keep in mind. If theyre too expensive get him some beanies or hats if hes into that. Now if you do get a board you can get any company board and they should be about  to  bucks. Just pick out whatever pictures he might like. but if youre on a budget try to see if a local shop has store brand boards or shop decks. They shouldnt be more than  dollars. Make sure you know his board size. If you dont just measure the WIDTH of the board in inches. It typically should be anywhere from . to . inches. If you dont have a good shop nearby and want to go order online I can recommend www.tactics.com and www.CCS.com. Great customer service and shipping times. Now wheels is a bit tricky. If he skates a lot on the street get him spitfire formula  wheels and go for a  mm size. Theyre good wheels. Bearings are always nice too which shouldnt be more than  bucks.Im assuming youre in the US pardon me if my assumptions are wrong. If you decide to buy online let me know and Ill send you some links or even if you have questions or want to find something cheaper let me know. I buy gifts for skaters every now and then lol. I remember my ex girlfriend bought me a cool hoodie and I appreciated so much that she went to a store and bought something that I like. It had a bunch of funny cartoon images and just happened to be my fav company. Anyways whatever lol I hope no matter what you get him he loves it. ,skateboarding,da9a8zq,5,t5_2qig3

Nike has such an enormous team that only a couple people really stand out. you know like someone gets on Emerica you know youre gonna see consistent footage and a part in a full length soon. with Nike its just not the same feel me? And only a very select few actually get a shoe from Nike because its impossible with such a large team. ,skateboarding,dguk229,4,t5_2qig3
