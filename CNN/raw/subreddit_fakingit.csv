3754433,0,t1_cqk3omu,Its a great day! In fact I think that the news that MTV renewed it for Season  is even more significant. Last time MTV ordered season  a day before the S finale whereas this time they renewed it an entire half a season ahead of time. Unfortunately this probably means S wont air until . ,fakingit,cqk8dus,2,t5_31eqm

7400081,0,t3_4gfjtc,I love Lauren and Liam living together lt They are so cute! I dont like the whole Sabrina thing though. I hate that Karma is right about her ughh she needs to learn that Amy can be friends with anybody and that wont affect their friendship. But well...drama here we go!,fakingit,d2jc9gb,2,t5_31eqm
7561663,0,t1_d31oah3,You are reaching. I watched the episode without commercials and there is no FelixKarma relationship. Shes his friend and thats it.  The horror Amy saw when she realized Karma had been right all along is more than enough to show we will get at least some of what we want.,fakingit,d31q3ks,1,t5_31eqm

7633607,0,t1_d39vpah,Yup I was pretty happy with the finale especially the sad look on Karmas face when Sabrina and Amy kissed. Too bad we couldnt get a wrap up season.,fakingit,d39we18,1,t5_31eqm
