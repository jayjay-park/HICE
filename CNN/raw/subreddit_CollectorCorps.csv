7372375,0,t1_d2g6ouv,I believe the  pack from FYE is just the standard versions packaged together.The Collectors Corps one as you know is the action pose pair in a battle stance against each other. They come with the unique pose as well as the bonus of being arranged in battle while still in box if youre an inbox collector.Its similar to how there was already an Ant Man Pop but the Ant Man box had the unmasked Ant Man...you wouldnt say theres already an AntMan Pop in that case so you shouldnt say the same here.,CollectorCorps,d2g6s9h,2,t5_367dq

8683425,0,t1_d6r13zh,Thank you for your concern.You can only get past boxes buy buying the current one so you have to buy at least two. Im selling them for cost  shipping unsure how that is terrible. Minimum cost is   . shipping IF you are in a place where they do not charge tax. Not like Im making money here.An no these are not used they have been opened and looked at thats it.,CollectorCorps,d6r1xtf,1,t5_367dq
9306241,0,t1_d8vlfad,Yeah they guaranteed a marvel shirt in every box originally then they changed it to say apparel so they could put scarves and other bullshit in there. Its the whole reason I signed up cause I didnt collect pops before this and was getting unhappy with the lack of shirts in lootcrates. Around the time of the Guardians shit storm there was a Screencap of the thing promising what was in each box but I cant find it anymore lol,CollectorCorps,d8vmt3i,-3,t5_367dq

Im not sure if it will actually be successful since its my very first box but my order went through successfully and my cards been charged so fingers crossed! Does Japan have any similar forwarding services that can help you forward mail from US to the country?,CollectorCorps,dfut0rp,1,t5_367dq
