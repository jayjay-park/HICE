454382,0,t1_cfrpzu4,i suppose this is a good time to wonder aloud whether OP is interested only in confirmed ones or if speculated ones count. in this vein im pretty fascinated by the trb. bob lazar im unable to throw away if that counts.as far as confirmed stuff im really interested in mkultra. pretty convinced they never really stopped. if that counts. ,SpecialAccess,cfrwua8,1,t5_2vkzl
650321,0,t1_cgds4ds,And looking at the the likely NGB there are definitely enough similarities that Id go so far as to say that whatever that picture is of likely has some sort of crankedkite planform.But youre right the wings dont look nearly large enough and it also appears that the engines of this unidentified bird are mounted closer to the centerline than they are on any of the supposed NGB designs.,SpecialAccess,cge6wkq,2,t5_2vkzl

1915327,0,t1_ckjysvj,They have been conventional aircraft when NOT inside the territory of another sovereign nation. Flying recon craft into a sovereign nation is considered an act of war. There is a distinct social engineering program coupled with a craft or crafts specifically tailored not to look conventional and this is exactly why other nations talk about those ufos flying over head and not those Americans flying over head. It is a brilliant ploy. ,SpecialAccess,ckjzfym,3,t5_2vkzl

3846314,0,t3_34g11r,Stealth Blimp?  Thats awfully good video  obviously professional shot with something that does low light without breaking a sweat and optically stabilised.  Strobes would seem to say dont collide with me please.   Are there hills overlooking the town?  Might it possibly be anticollision beacons from radio and television antenna overlooking the town?

8123178,0,t3_4qfr8y,Was it a modified KAA or is the KAA a designation for the modified camera. As in the A for Apollo?I have heard of the KA but never the A mod. Looking at the KA series it looks more like it would be a recce platform.Wired has an article that says Apollo  used a KA. Could it be that  was mistakenly changed to A it seems like a easy mistake looking at  year old docs.If it was a KA was from an RP Orion...but nothing firm on my end.,SpecialAccess,d4t49dj,3,t5_2vkzl
8442441,0,t1_d52537h,Honestly probably not. Similar to how we no longer need a recon jet that can do mach  theres no longer any need to keep a plane in the air indefinitely especially now that were so good at inair refueling that crew stamina is the limiting factor.,SpecialAccess,d5wue60,1,t5_2vkzl
