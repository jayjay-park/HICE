24066,0,t1_ceh5fmr,No way its Totally worth the money.    Just trying to make you feel weird. I didnt use a microscope when I did my experiment I figured it would show up as a sort of snowflake pattern. After rechecking online about the experiment it said it never worked with tap water which is what I think I used I dont know I wasnt trying that hard with it. But it does show up as a snowflake looking crystal when it works right. Im just wondering if its still visible without a microscope just like snowflakes are or if they are microsnowflake crystals and youd HAVE to use a microscope. Somehow...the more I read about his experiments the more they sound like pseudoscience the fact that no one else has replicated his experiments the crystals are the structure that theyd be according to the temperatures he used the fact that he sells special water products on his webpage..things like this.,energy_work,ceh68go,1,t5_2t3ww

283395,0,t3_1xbq1x,When smoking pot I found that meditation was easier because I could feel my body reacting to my thoughts. I could feel the buzz from a touch on the hand traveling to my brain and then with each exhale I would feel tension resolved. For me and weed we have a connection that noobs tend to have of super exaggerated feelings of touch and bliss. After my first puff of anything I can feel it in my sinuses then my head feels all fuzzy and when it finally touched my limbs and I am amazed at feeling then I know that I will be in for a solid mediation.

I find that when I sleep in on Saturdays I tend to gave a higher chance of getting out though I always seem to screw things up by letting myself feel shocked that its happening.

1460242,0,t3_2avekq,I believe that our mentalemotionalenergetic states are like grooves on a record. The ones that we easily and habitually use have deeper grooves and the needle of Time easily stays in them. The ones we we rarely use in this case the heart chakra as you describe it have shallow grooves and so even when we are able to reach them the needle falls out and into some tired old groove.I believe that in order to be able to stay in a chosen groove the groove must be deepened. That means one must practice getting to that groove and staying there as much as possible until the act becomes natural and one has created a new habitual groove.This is what Ive been doing to get to that groove. I try to practice the following daily  Get into a meditative state using a preferred method. That is sit still and quietly and still the mind.  Smile on the inside Find the physical sensation caused by that inward smile. For me this is a happy loving glow in my chest which I interpret to be my heart chakra.  Expand that sensation all while smiling on the inside. Are you a Leo by chance?EDITI wanted to add another technique that I use in normal daytoday activities I visualize gifting people items throughout the day from my Heart center.

3207818,0,t3_2wuxob,I deal with this daily. People sometimes have bad energy. Mostly because they dont think about energy and just go about life with no idea about it other than today theyre in a good mood or today theyre in a bad mood. You have to realize that you play a part in this energy transaction. Personally I leak. Like a faucet turned on at half speed I leak quite a bit. My only recourse for healing is sleeping or meditating. So its a two way street the person draining you is draining you because you allow them to.Grounding is a good start it can help replenish your positive energies and dump the bad ones. Shielding is your next course of action. It can be difficult to learn how to shield. Im still getting the hang of it myself. I would suggest the white light protection technique over building your own shield that is described here in renergywork. My preference not yours. Do what works for you. The white light protection technique can be found over at rkundaliniI also found something about sensory gating techniques. Its essentially a form of Metta meditation. Find your heart beat sink into it and block other things out. Dont be unconcious of whats going on around you stay alert but know that no one else has your same heart beat. Send loving kindness to it while youre there like you would greeting a puppy or kitten.By no means am I a teacher these are just a few things that I have picked up along my path that seem to work for me. You could look for a teacher in your area probably a yogi or a meditation teacher would be your best bet.Good luck to you. And much success.,energy_work,couhmfw,3,t5_2t3ww

4793638,0,t1_ctxya62,Thanks for clarifying. To me what you want sounds like healing. My experience of working with a skilled healer has been this weve started with issues affecting me in the present such as a difficult relationship with my mother. Good healers can see damage in your energy field as well as the experiences that caused it. So he can help me reconnect with events in my past that I may have forgotten experiences with my mother that contribute to our difficulty. We work on bringing the emotions to the surface and clearing them out. Replacing fear with love judgement with acceptance. The old patterns and resentments are cleared out and the energetic damage is healed. My aura becomes closer to perfect my thoughts and emotions are clearer and flow more easily my purpose shines through. I dont forget what happened in fact I often remember more things from the womb infancy childhood but I have compassion for her and the difficulties she faced raising me. Those big emotional traumas are the obvious place to start but even after all those are cleared there is lots to do. Work on connecting strongly to the earth plane or opening up more to the spiritual realm. Finding your life purpose and learning to embody it. Learning to travel in other dimensions other lives. Channeling. Its a long list. There are healers of many different traditions that will have radically different approaches and as I said there are way to do it yourself but having a guide make the journey easier. Your question is why its healthy because the energy fieldaura is the template for your physical body. Distortions in the field work their way down the the physical. If theyre not healed they lead to disease. Beyond the physical energy work clears your emotional and spiritual blocks as well. Healing these things makes you happier and more fulfilled. I feel like I rambled a bit but I hope that helps. ,energy_work,ctyrzmj,2,t5_2t3ww

5182763,0,t1_cva6r56,quick answer  physics is a plane description of the universe and what we experience. electromagnetic field equations propose a wide spread of experiments which are often easy to set up and analyze .and thats just one possible tool . i get your point about the distance but experiments using entagled quantumpairs showed tha no matter how far the physically distance between them get they instantly take over the probabilities of theyre counterpart  this lets to two possible explanations either the quantum uses light to transport the information or the distancespace is an interpretation of perception and physically not real . an optical illusion as to say. the first answer was checked experimental by analyzing the progress of quantumpairs being entangled . if a delay would appear at somepoint it would proof that distance is real. not a slightest occur of a delay in any way was measured the measurmentmethod included technology based on quantumcomputing and  laser microscopes which are precise enough to  exclude a measurementfailure. and the reason why science ....so that you actually know what you are doing in detail no offense but all this unprecise predicting and relating is not founded on anything logicallly usable. its not esoteric voodoo or what do i know people call it its just a consequence of how things actually work in the observable universe . thats a mindful way to generalize certain words and things . one process or one appearance of energy is described entirely different every time i read about it. to answer the importance ... i actually dont care but i want everyone who does care to have the possibility of refering to something recognized. i experienced everything i base my validations on . i actually had a lot of practical training and i talked to a lot of people resulting in patterns which predictable appear when a certain thing happens leading to further conclusions so on and so on. Despite all that without a understatement of quantummechanics you never can understand things like duality  energytransferintuition and that only means that you are gettin very close to manipulation but you never will gain real control its just interfering... and thats playing dice if you intentionally do things. i dont see much awareness of the responsibility...... everything you do has consequences on the same level as your action was performed. just stop guessing when thinking leads to real answers.    ,energy_work,cvapo28,1,t5_2t3ww

6428488,0,t3_43pscp,I think this is dependent on a number of different things.  Where you are in your journey what your daily routine is like what your meditative time is like....and more.I found that in my life when Ive tried to sleep and find that my energy levels start to spike its often because Im FINALLY giving space and time to my higher self.  I usually havent been meditating for awhile I likely havent been tending to my space either my home or my sacred space I likely have been feeling urges but I have been doing my best to ignore them.Around  years ago I found myself trapped in a job I hated but I couldnt quit due to a contract I had written out and signed between me and God.  I did that because I knew staying committed to something like the same job for  years would be a benefit to my character and growth as a man.  It was a bitch of a commitment tho and at  years I was seriously doubting whether I could complete it or not.I found that the more miserable I became in that job the harder time I had sleeping.  I would literally lay down exhausted only to find myself popping up after  hours of frustration to go do something else.I started to look around for reasons and discovered a few things that really helped. I started exercising more to burn off extra energy.   I kept a pen and paper by my bed so anytime I started to obsess on my thoughts and what I needed to do I would turn on the light write down whatever came to mind no matter how crazy then go back to relaxing and trying to fall asleep.  This was a HUGE discovery and helped me let go of my obsession about what I needed to do the next day.  It also had the added benefit of functioning like a TO DO list.   I started noticing that I was having difficulty sleeping after reading computer books.  I would read to try and go to bed but computer books were actually making the problem worse.  Why?  Because I wasnt following a path that I knew deep down I REALLY wanted to follow which was learning a LOT more about how computers work.  So to fix this I started studying computer books after dinner in the evenings and refused to do it in bed.  I also noticed something similar happening when reading engaging novels....so I tried to find some really boring books to read.  You may laugh but it helped.  So your reasons and triggers are likely quite different but something about listening to these inner urges started to help me unwind what was really going on.  Before long I was back to sleeping with ease and onto a new and different career path....but it still took years of work for me to sort all that out.  But thats a story for a different post. Best of luck  listen to your urges.  I have come to believe that its our higher self trying to help us into a better life.,energy_work,czk8s1j,1,t5_2t3ww

It helps to think of a way to value your own life enough to know that these things should have no power over you. They only have as much power as you give them you see she may have influences from real entities or entities on a less physical plane and even though it IS real it could still be REAL schizophrenia. Im a telepath so I would know how this stuff works she IS special in that most people dont end up like her. But if you really want it to stop you have to first accept that it is a part of your mind and you essentially have to think it away so to speak. Like I said this is tricky but it IS possible to redirect your mental focus and actually make your reality serve you better.

8011898,0,t3_4nsbyr,gti think its either A the voices really are from an external entity but they are not who they claim to be. or B its really just schizophrenia.gtgthow can you tell which one it is? Even trained psychiatrists cannot tell.See If you believe there is an external world out there then there is a question which of my perceptions hail from the external world and which one are private to me?  If you dont believe in an external world this side of the problem goes away entirely because then you know all perceptions are reflections of your own mind and nothing else.  Then there is a different question how can I get my mind to enter into a relatively pleasant and manageable state?  And the answer here is to continue developing selfunderstanding and realize that your own Will is the Law inside your own Mind.At one point I developed voices talking in my mind by simply talking to myself in different voices.  At first I had to deliberately talk to myself in say the voice of a cartoon character or a friend to make it happen.  But eventually even when I wasnt doing it the voices went on autopilot so to speak.  At first I thought it was amazing and I just enjoyed listening.  After a while I missed the silence.  So I made all the voice shut up.  So it never became an actual runaway problem for me because I never fully externalized those voices.  Meaning I always knew those voices even when on autopilot are nonetheless under the domain of my Will.  So when it wasnt my Will to hear the voices they vanished just like that.  I am the master of my own mind. Now it might be hard for you to explain to your family member that shes the master of her own mind if she insists those voices are real and by this I take it she means truly external.  Remember Will is the Law.  If its her Will that some perceptions are deemed external she will lose control over them because you cannot control something you dont believe is yours to control.  Its going to keep happening until she realizes she doesnt have to believe that!  That belief is a choice!  Even thinking conventional world is external to anyones mind is purely a choice as well.  If one or another choice of ours no longer works for us we are free to change that choice as long as we know its a choice.  Where we can get stuck is if we dont realize something is a choice and start believing it is how it is.  Then we can get stuck because we dont believe we can affect a different sort of Will.,energy_work,d4gm1ej,3,t5_2t3ww
