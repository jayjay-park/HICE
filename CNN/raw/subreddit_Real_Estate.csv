4661914,0,t3_3deoj2,We had something similar with an underhanded bank.  The bank sent out an inspector decided the screenedin porch was habitable and counted it as liveable property and called the county appraiser and had them change the sq ft.  I noticed it and called the appraiser told them I was the actual homeowner and they needed to change it back.  They did but they said it was legal because some people consider that space to be an actual liveable space.  It has no insulation.  No ac or heat.  Separate from the house with a door but its a legal liveable space.  Probably the same call for that basement.  Call the appraiser and see what they say.,Real_Estate,cti6v26,1,t5_2qx53
5238790,0,t3_3mpxly,Have you ever built from the ground up before? It can be a long process. King county is known for being sticklers and taking a long time. Look for land that already has electric service a well and water system and a septic system if possible for unincorporated King County. A good way to find this is to look for manufactured houses on land btw. Then you can live in it while building the first house removesell the manuf. and build the second. Check the zoning of any property because you might not be able to put in two houses unless you buy  acres and subdivide. You can give yourself a utility easement for the second lot in that case. Dont rule out Snohomish county just north known for being easier to deal with.,Real_Estate,cvhgq1g,1,t5_2qx53

Sent the sellers agent an email that pretty much said appraisal came in at a value to secure financing and the buyer has chosen not to share the contents of this confidential document.  They didnt push much further and agreed to the large repairs which are currently in progress.  Thanks for putting my mind at ease during this process!!,Real_Estate,d0l4219,2,t5_2qx53

Mike at this point has turned a PROFIT on his half of the house. Mike has more in his bank account than you me and my other brother and my mom combined. Edit Just to be clear by what I mean when I say that Mike has a lot of money in the bank Im saying that the guy is literally almost a millionaire.

Sounds like a good idea to not renew the lease with her or if she is violating anything document it. Also read your landlord tenant act you might be exempt form having to pay out of pocket for modifications usually the tenant has to and you just have to allow reasonable modifications providing they pay for it both to put up and take down and to code.

Consider approaching the seller about owner financing with a considerable down payment. Possibly with a payoff in  years. That will give you enough time to work on your credit score while also building equity into your new old home.Or an FHA k rehab loan may be an option.

11621333,0,t3_65tcsy,I found out the hard way with a house Im closing on Friday the issue may be the termites. Most lenders wont finance a house without a clearance letter from a termite company. And if theres already termite damage most termite companies wont give a clearance letter till the damage is fixed. With it being Freddie Mac nothing will get fixed before closing hence the as is. Also because of this there may be issues that come in the appraisal that your lender wants fixed before closing and once again Freddie Mac isnt going to fix it. Ive learned a lot about purchasing foreclosures over the last few months as Ive house shopped. Finding one you can get financing on without some sort of a repair being needed first is difficult. But it can be done. You just have to find it soon after it is listed and jump on it. ,Real_Estate,dgdaewi,6,t5_2qx53
