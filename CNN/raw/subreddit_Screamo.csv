2072215,0,t3_2ikyag,Solely based on my own ignorance the only difference between the two genres is the style of vocals. I know that last sentence was obvious as could be.There really isnt much to think about. Sometimes people just want to hear screaming vocals. Bands like Old Gray State Faults and William Bonney are a few examples of what I listen to that may be considered screamo some would say that they are post hardcore but there is a lot of crossover in my opinion. I cant really explain why I like them or what the appeal is I am far from an expert. It really just comes down to preference. Kind of the same reason I like redheads. I suggest you cross post this over to rEmoScreamo. They should be able to help you with your question as well as give you some recommendations. Good luck.,Screamo,cl382sy,0,t5_2sz5o
