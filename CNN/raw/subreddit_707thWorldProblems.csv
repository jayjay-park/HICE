10888092,0,t1_de1jlu0,Thats strange.Ive given you level  operating abilities. You should now be able to manifest yourself as a physical entity and interact with this world like a normal resident would be able to. That is to say you are in someways almost godlike. Feel free to move at the speed of sound fly through the air conjure cities and peoples or become one of them. Theyll disappear when you leave although most never do. Well not until recently. Has anything happened to the tower?You also cant interfere with the expression of the other residents. Although there arent any. Knock yourself out have fun. It seems you still cant leave though.,707thWorldProblems,de3126k,2,t5_3cowp
