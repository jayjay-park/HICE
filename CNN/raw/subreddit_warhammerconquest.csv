2069199,0,t3_2ihpeh,Yeah that error in the video irked me as soon as I saw it. I doubled checked the book thinking Have I been playing this wrong the whole time?! But no the video guys messed that one up. The units go home when the planet is removed from the board so they would be in the HQ by the time Atrox Prime would resolve.,warhammerconquest,cl2u9wk,2,t5_3102o
2075780,0,t3_2ilnkd,On the box it says  minutes per game. Three rounds would be very long for an LCG. I assume best of  swiss. Pure speculation but following how Netrunner worked when it was first released I could see something like a win gets you  Prestige a loss or going to time gets you Prestige equal to the number of planets you have won.  Netrunner abandoned this model based on how people were building their decks to deny prestige but I actually think this would work well in Conquest.  ,warhammerconquest,cl3odkn,1,t5_3102o
2264594,0,t3_2l4fas,The typical strategy for dealing with Maxos is to shoot him first with your strongest unit get blocked by Indomitable try again with another unit get shielded and then watch as he deploys a librarian and a tac squad to demolish all of your exhausted units.....SPACE MARINES!,warhammerconquest,clrmghl,3,t5_3102o
2429148,0,t3_2n8czp,I find the damage and cards a better effect than shields. I usually put it on something like Mortar Squad so it becomes a  ATK unit with Straken that the enemy just wants to kill. Ill then sac something to ready it and fire again. Then when he kills it I probably just draw another one to replace it or maybe an Elysian Strike Team that can now be played in etc. But really it can go anywhere and be of use. If the enemy ignores him because he doesnt want to give you card draw then Ill stack on the extra damage turn after turn.,warhammerconquest,cmby78b,2,t5_3102o
2476636,0,t3_2nwq3o,One of my favourite commanders for tricky plays.Exhaust a beefy opponent unit and use the command squad he has which gets a boost when the target is exhausted to snipe it out.,warhammerconquest,cmhu08g,1,t5_3102o
2580378,0,t3_2pbo7o,Never really understood this card? I guess it could go into a beefy Blood Angelsdeck. With This  Bodyguard on them.

3385972,0,t3_2yww87,Example was Death from Above Deploy Action Put a nonElite Mobile unit into play from your hand at the last planet. so to play this card during the deploy phase i pay the  resource and then pay the printed cost of the card i put into play at the last planet? If thats how it works then why would I pay the  resource to use that card during the deploy phase when i could deploy the unit card anyway to the last planet? ,warhammerconquest,cpe8797,1,t5_3102o
4321670,0,t3_3ahica,I think since they are both reactions he can. You take turns resolving reactions so he could resolve primal howl and then Ragnars ability to bloody Starbane.,warhammerconquest,cscs4sx,4,t5_3102o

4955226,0,t1_cuj1tye,Because with a single core theres not much of a deckbuilding aspect. Dont get me wrong  my favorite thing about Conquest is how little deckbuilding matters compared to other card games but as you build decks youll be able to build decks around certain cards and synergies which changes how the game is played. With one core you get some good cards some bad cards that dont match so its more about how many units you can put on the board than how they work together.,warhammerconquest,cuj5aa6,2,t5_3102o

6143426,0,t3_3zpajv,Very situational card I have x of it in my Swarmlord deck. Most of the time its a shield but sometimes you can make some serious plays with it. One game my opponent played Firedrake planet one and had another Firedrake sitting at planet two which had been brought in by Yvarn turn one I believe plus one or two command cappers at other planets. He lost everything and I lost two Termagant tokens and a heavily damaged Ymgarl three damage on it already. The best part was he had spent everything on bringing in the Firedrake so I could commit  freely that round as well.,warhammerconquest,cynxyjg,3,t5_3102o
6355721,0,t3_42li8m,I think I might have moved the Bloodied Reavers over to the planet with Eldorath.  Now youre exchanging  swings for  swings.  Take a damage swing for   Eldorath shields  takes .  Eldorath swings for  or retreats shield swing for  no mercy.  Now there is no Irridial and Eldorath is at  damage  on round   edit and hes out TWO Issha.,warhammerconquest,czc2qg5,2,t5_3102o
6370452,0,t3_42wycu,Remember that additive damage comes before doubling i.e. the extra damage from brutal happens before it gets doubled.

6374047,0,t1_cze0z62,Keep in mind you can play him again if the first copy dies. Also its rare to want to play multiple cost units unless youre already winning handily in my experience.,warhammerconquest,cze5qmy,2,t5_3102o
6542839,0,t1_czw2i8p,gt A change in the game state is achieved by the preThen aspect of the effect where the game state changes from a planet that has a printed green icon to a planet that has a printed green icon and a modifier granting it a green icon.gt Originally it would only take one lose a green icon effects to strip the planet of the icon. After Summary Execution is played it would take two lose a green icon effects to strip the planet of the icon.Note that theres some pretty weird stuff about this ruling. Apparently you dont get to draw a card in this scenario. I wouldnt be too surprised if they change their minds about this some time from nowAlso on reading the comments there my interpretation wasnt entirely correct. The planet doesnt end up having two green icons. It has a green icon and a modifier granting a green icon but having a green icon is a binary state. It does or it does not. Theres no multiple green icons per se.,warhammerconquest,czw2zg7,1,t5_3102o
6813915,0,t1_d0ogcml,I mean thats a busted unit because of the extra command symbol. Theres not inherent bonus to a unit being loyal but if it has a superior number of CSs then thats a huge bonus. Thats why XX for  resources are so good.,warhammerconquest,d0onkrw,1,t5_3102o

7769880,0,t1_d3osxur,I really enjoy deck building. It feels a bit like puzzle solving and its really rewarding to find something that work. Nahumekh seems like quite the challenge and I love that about him. Hes also pretty interesting gameplay wise. My list doesnt do anything new or fancy and could easily be considered boring in fact as all Im doing is dropping highly efficient units. But playing around the deployment restrictions and inconsistencies of this deck is a challenge that I havent had with any other and I enjoy that. All that said I do think Anrakyr is probably the better warlord of the  and hes interesting in his own right.,warhammerconquest,d3pdfvn,1,t5_3102o

7947273,0,t1_d48pc66,I believe theres an official ruling that you cant. Summary Execution is until the end of the battle it counts as green.

Or he may ambush in a unit after all your units have readied but before the first unit has taken a swing. As soon as youve both passed on actions in the action window before the attack its your turn to swing you have at least one ready unit and theres no defender on the opposing side then you win the battle.,warhammerconquest,de9ya9r,3,t5_3102o
