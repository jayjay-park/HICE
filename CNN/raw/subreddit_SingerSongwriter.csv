1832298,0,t3_2fk67y,Hi all my self rNaV GiLLthe best lines i like We are all a little weird and lifes a little weird and when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours we join up with them and fall in mutual weirdness and call it love.You learn to like someone when you find out what makes them laugh but you can never truly love someone until you find out what makes them cry. The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden a dim twilight and a fountain singing to it. You and you alone make me feel that I am alive. Other men it is said have seen angels but I have seen thee and thou art enough.,SingerSongwriter,ck9zi3d,1,t5_2svm9
