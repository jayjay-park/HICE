4043929,0,t1_crglvob,Mhm... sure! Its round  currently! We tested the arena with a pretty high level team but barely made it past . Although looking at the highscore besides the obvious cheaters it seems a lot of people are making it a lot further.

4173960,0,t1_crw0k3k,Thank you for the backstory but Im not sure what any of it has to do with this game. This reddit is to talk about a unique and interesting idle game not toot our own horns. Sorry to be frank but it just comes off as a look at me post... which I think many frown upon.,idleraiders,crw1dz7,-1,t5_36sl7
4178851,0,t3_38nth0,Perhaps the bow could be made more useful if it gave a distance multiplier such as increase range by  instead of just a linear boost. That way an archer with the bow would benefit more than a warrior with it and you wouldnt have to eat up all your equipment slots to get them a little further out of harms way. Then you could opt to have long range archers but they just wouldnt do nearly as much damage so it would balance out a little safety vs. damage output.,idleraiders,crwle6o,1,t5_36sl7
4187027,0,t1_crxietc,I thought the point of the game was to spend as little of your time on it as possible while you do something else. After all its an idle game.If this game measures who is good and who is bad at it by who will farm that . chance item quicker whether through speed or through sheer luck then I think Ill quit this game. What youre saying is that my chances of winning rest upon a favourable output of a random number generator. Thanks but no thanks.,idleraiders,crxitjo,-2,t5_36sl7
4197959,0,t3_38phti,Ive noticed that every time my scavenger gets lazy theres one item somewhere on the screen that he cant get to. Its slightly on a tree or something.   Hes fixated on it so ignores everything else but the pathfinding notices he cant get there....Anyway pick up that one item and hell get back to work. ,idleraiders,cryrgzn,1,t5_36sl7

4871397,0,t1_cu8kefz,gt It looks like the warrior bar is correct its just labeled MP. Same with the archer.Oh yeah I see it now. Turns out Markus pushed another update to the server almost immediately after I told him wed need text to actually show the rageenergymana that raiders have and I didnt realize it DRegarding performance Ill investigate what could be going wrong. Specifically the game running faster after you have more raiders sounds pretty weird but of course its possible theres something unintended happening in the code.,idleraiders,cu8ks4o,1,t5_36sl7

4990622,0,t3_3j763m,Resterance also got stuck after being attacked by monsters in the nd raid  so maybe he was also hit in this th raid.That means itd only be something that happens when theres loot left from last run and Resterance runs ahead early.

5058125,0,t3_3jx7w6,If it helps you this is the build with which I did today for the first time the Raid   in  tries The hardest battle is the ice undoubtedly. Use scrolls of damage healing and mana regeneration when necessary and will become more bearable.Ive been playing  days and thought I need  days more to buy the other two boxes of equipment to face the Raid  but isnt as difficult as seems with de red swords.,idleraiders,cuvp0zi,1,t5_36sl7

5730288,0,t3_3tm4s9,One way to work around it is to have your warriors spam disarm on him. I can stuck it around  times on him making his damage bearable at  resets but if the hit comes just after the debuff disappears... i m dead ,idleraiders,cx7ecaw,1,t5_36sl7
5737518,0,t1_cx8a2o1,Well just tested.Without primal rage i managed  hits in  seconds. Base atk speed is  seconds so with full helmets its one hit every . seconds so i expected  hits which is quite close tbh. With primal rage i counted . If its multiplicative we could expect  more hits which was not close if its additive we can expect . atk speed so  hit every . seconds so  hits which is closer to what we had at the last example. The  hits mistake could be because atk speed goes of after the first hit hence the first second is one hit instead of  in both cases or i just count a bit wrong trying to watch both timers at once.I m  sure its added not multiplied with the rest of your atk speed.,idleraiders,cx8an19,2,t5_36sl7
