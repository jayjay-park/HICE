9944853,0,t3_5hy1n4,From NZ Herald Rocket Lab has moved a step closer to liftoff with the qualification and acceptance testing of its firststage booster.The company says the completion of the tests marks the final major technical milestone ahead of first test launch of the Electron vehicle.The work was done on a test bed in a rural area about  minutes drive south of Auckland.Rocket Lab chief executive Peter Beck said it was the last major test before the stage is integrated with fuel tanks and transported by truck to the launch pad at Mahia south of Gisborne.All primary components of the stage  including engines vehicle structures avionics and software systems  were designed developed and tested inhouse at the Aucklandbased company. The test bed work pushed the equipment beyond conditions it was expected to encounter after launch.It had hoped to get the first of three test launches away some time this month but this would now not happen.Mahia township experiences a considerable population spike through the summer and in order to minimise any disruptions to local residents and visitors our preference is to conduct the first test launch after the holidays Beck said.The launch pad was on private land at the end of Mahia Peninsula and he advised anyone interested that they would get a better look online at what the company did.Wairoa hopes to be able to accommodate Skyline Aviations Cessna Mustang jet used in Hawkes bay for the Air Ambulance Service.

Joining Tristram Clayton is NZ Herald aviation reporter Grant Bradley to explain what Rocket Lab have managed to do in these tests.VideoWatch NZH Focus The most powerful machine ever built in New ZealandWere going to go when were ready. We could rush the vehicle to the pad. Unless everyone feels we have done the best we can we dont go.There were about  people at the Mahai site and around four times that number at the Auckland base where rockets are being made and the programmes mission control is based. Final work was being done on monitoring and tracking equipment at a number of sites including the Chatham Islands.Staff had been working long hours over six or seven days a week but would get a decent break over Christmas.The company plans to launch three test flights next year before moving quickly into a commercial programme.Customers signed to fly on Electron include NASA Planet Spire and Moon Express. With a dedicated launch priced from US. million .m Rocket Lab says Electron is the most affordable small satellite launch vehicle.Electron is a carboncomposite vehicle that uses Rocket Labs Dprinted Rutherford engines for its main propulsion system. Electron is m in length .m in diameter and has a liftoff mass of  kg.The vehicle is capable of delivering payloads of up to  kg to a  km sunsynchronous orbit the target range for the highgrowth constellationsatellite market.Beck said Rocket Lab has had a hugely successful year with qualification of all major vehicle systems completion of Launch Complex  and considerable growth of our team and customer base.

10793051,0,t1_ddt7hlw,Im guessing youre saying cost advantage over spacex? Isnt rocketlab like kg more than the falcon ? Im a huge fan of RL but you pay a premium for dedicated launch in the small sat arena. ,RocketLab,ddt86dw,1,t5_32sob
11183075,0,t1_deyo8it,Looks like the first we hear is on local tv.  The one month clock has run down based upon the launch dep. managers estimates. Perhaps a few more weeks. If longer something has gone wrong. Perhaps the reality of the launch technology holds them up. But Im patiently awaiting for the news on tv of a launch.  Hopefully launch cadence will then pick up real quick and this subreddit will take off too!,RocketLab,dezl7dx,1,t5_32sob
