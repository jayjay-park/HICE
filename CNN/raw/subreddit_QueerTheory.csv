7461108,0,t1_d2psphe,gtAs a genderqueer person Im particularly interested in stuff that explores nonbinary identities.In that case I super recommend Dean Spades stuff. Mutilating Gender like much of Spades work is all about bodily autonomy and disruptions to the system of gender. A lot of Spades writing is linked on his professional website. And it seems like he did a regular blogging projectwww.makezine.enoughenough.org with a friendcolleague of his for a bit on a range of topics. Ive only read a few from that website but He Schme is a personal favorite.RadTransFem has also done some pretty awesome writing deconstructing binary gender systems and regularly reblogslinksquotes things that are worthwhile reads.,QueerTheory,d2qa5h8,1,t5_2vimd
