535447,0,t1_cg14rgf,No worries! I realize after I sent that it could be interpreted both ways. Not only do we not accept any money for AMAs but we dont even allow reddit media to promote them for a minimum of  hours. Driving traffic to a reddit post with paid media would unfairly bring attention and voting on posts. Organic reddit posts need to be organic. We have allowed advertisers to drive to AMAs after additional voting would not impact their ranking and some times celebrities had taken out ads postAMA to thank the community or continue the conversation. We have also had some advertisers use selftext posts to have QA sessions within a headline and its comments but these are not AMAs they are QA sessions about particular products or services and exist within a headline rather than in an individual subreddit.Totally not sure about being paid to be listed on the AMA schedule in the past. Its definitely not the case now!,sxswdoingredditwrong,cg14xyb,3,t5_309f6
