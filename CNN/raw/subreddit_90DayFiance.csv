9007181,0,t3_53gqeo,My wife is originally from Thailand. One of the biggest differences is food. Most of what my wife likes to eat is either soup based or rice based while my diet is more bread based. Her cooking usually encompasses the full scope of flavors sweetspicysourbitter and is very aromatic. There are a good amount of differences economically as well. Thai and maybe all Asian cultures want to have their own business. I think its easier to start your own business there bc they have less regulation vs here depending on what you are going to do their is a myriad of laws you need to follow and license you need to obtain. ,90DayFiance,d7uisy7,2,t5_34i5y

9326026,0,t1_d8xz7xh,I think I saw one of those documentaries.  It just seems so....odd.....to go on a trip looking for a wife.   The guys were no prize so maybe thats why this was their only or last option. Ive also seen a few shows like Forensic Files that featured a husband who killed his mailorder bride after she wanted to divorce him and be independent.  ,90DayFiance,d8y553r,9,t5_34i5y

9331657,0,t1_d8yudjr,She has a husband other sons and yes a step ladder would be an easy solution. Oh wait it is far too much work for him to expect her to go buy a step ladder! He is the one who always goes to the store for them! Its a never ending cycle!,90DayFiance,d8yut9z,5,t5_34i5y

9396327,0,t3_597lyk,I thought prenups were only about protecting assets going into a marriage as well besides the crazy annual or decade bonuses celebrities pay to their spouses but based off of personal experience its not just that. Prenups can also predetermine division of joint marital assets upon divorce so instead of a joint bank account and properties being split  it can be split more in favor of one party i.e. . Chantels parents mightve been suggesting this.IANAL but my husbands mom and divorce lawyer stepdad suggested we get a prenup and I laughed at them because we didnt have much to protect. Not until after our wedding did my husband confess they specified to just him that their prenup request was intended to ensure my husband would get more than half of our marital assets in a potential divorce.,90DayFiance,d971tpv,1,t5_34i5y
9399165,0,t1_d97do4p,Yeah I like how Jorge said he wanted a traditional housewife who would stay home to cook and clean yet he picks Anfisa who does not and will not do either.,90DayFiance,d97erts,8,t5_34i5y
9402041,0,t1_d97qyx4,Woah I totally have seen love me. IIRC it was on Netflix a couple years back? I forgot all about this but from what I remember your description was accurate. It was like a tour bus of women for  American dudes one was a construction worker I think? If any of these are on YouTube you should start a thread in here I think it could be a little educational and def will fit in with the themes of the show ,90DayFiance,d97rwxa,2,t5_34i5y

9510686,0,t3_5b2b70,Yeah wait until youre all caught up. I watched the most recent episode and I just rolled my eyes and sighed when she started balling over something she should have known was a bad idea. Shes like that friend that pretends to ask for relationship advice when really they just want to vent.

9601511,0,t3_5c7z3k,Yea. It was a prank! However Im not sure how they seem in love to everybody? On the reunion show they definitely seemed close but on the show I mean her sister was not nice at all. Devars sisters maybe bc of editing just laughed about the situation and did the whole giving money to his little sister ever get resolved?,90DayFiance,d9wkzh0,2,t5_34i5y
9603159,0,t1_d9wiobd,not necessarily I know people like her and it doesnt really matter on what person they just fixate all day on something and if that person gets fed up the next day they are fixated on someone else..there has to be some mental illness related to it...the person I know would smash xboxs make threats over facebook..its so crazy how obsessed she gets and then within  days its on to the next obsession lol,90DayFiance,d9wsasv,7,t5_34i5y

On top of that his Escalade was full of PVC pipe and grow supplies. Dont know if he got the idiot sign Anfisia scratched in the door fixed but he did not even bother to was it.   He could of at least rented a cheap limotowncar with a driver. I think Anfisa keyed his Escalade because she knew the Audi R was a rental.,90DayFiance,dabssvf,6,t5_34i5y
9730684,0,t3_5e80nk,My roommate and I agreed that they just bring out the worst in each other. Jorge seems to love to have her there to be a victim which he kinda is and dump on her for being so mean. And she is there for money and cause she likes him I think she really does but its not healthy. From the reunion it seemed like she really wanted Jorge to defend her in some capacity if she deserved it or not is another thing but he just kept talking about how awful she is. They may love each other but its a toxic relationship.  ,90DayFiance,dacipal,3,t5_34i5y

9929508,0,t3_5hgmwg,news update i think i found adfree streamables for the rest of the seasons.  is the site.  caveats  there are a lot of broken links to sort through basically i just checked to see if ep from season  would stream and the third or fourth link finally worked. i didnt peep the full episode so i didnt even really full test it. the second caveat use an adblocker since the broken links can make annoying popups and stuff mine stopped a bunch of them so it wasnt too annoying. TLDR i think i found legit streams for the rest of the series but it still is gonna be week by week. ill find the links for you each week when i post the thread. someone can test the link and gimme feedback if they are up for it.,90DayFiance,db1u99p,1,t5_34i5y
