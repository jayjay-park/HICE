Say youre trying to be legitimate with a real job is it possible to get a transfer?This sort of thing happens a lot. Dont make a big deal out of WHAT your infraction was when having the conversation. Just trying to do your duty and make sure your paperwork is in order as you make a transition to a new job...And then you should definitely move. Good luck!Edit  Probation officer not parole,TexEnts,d1y8t7i,10,t5_2sjl7
