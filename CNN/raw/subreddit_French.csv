168497,0,t3_1w0c8u,Quebecois vs French dubs.Both exist for all blockbusters. If you download the movie you can get one or the other. And yes the Quebecoiss one can seem a bit weird.Its pretty easy to notice which one you got. The best tip for this is to listen to the characters names when they call each other or speak about somebody else. The names are pronounced with an American accent in the Quebecs french version and with a french accent for the Frances french version. With names like Michael Anderson Robert etc. its very noticeable. The R is an instant giveaway.And it can be useful to know which one you got. A lot of expression differs from one to the other. So if youre trying to improve your french be sure to get the right one Pe.g. My favorite one Asshole will become Trou de cul in Quebec and Trou du cul in french.,French,cexmidp,3,t5_2rd5t

322935,0,t3_1xqn4h,As a native French speaker I dont feel particularly more confident speaking English but I feel different anyway.I tend to lower my voice a bit and I noticed a few months ago that I took more time to express myself instead of rushing through my ideas as fast as I was comfortable doing in French.I applied to my French what my English practices taught me Im a better orator in French than before speaking more clearly and more steadily taking time to let words land even making small pauses here and there. Im still working on deepening my French voice on the same level as my English one though.As a side note OP accents bring a great deal of charm to the table. Two years ago a then coworker of mine told me that I had a good English accent but that it was a bit sad. I asked why and with a smirk on her face she told me that a French accent was cute enough to be worthy of keeping.You may not feel comfortable with your English accent among your peers but I can assure you that an accent goes a long way when youre surrounded by French people ,French,cfe8qxy,1,t5_2rd5t

I did find a lot of people who think it shouldnt be done. part of the issue has to do with a debate about whether Canada has a standardized version of french uses words and expressions outside slang and informal speech in mediaacademics separate from european french. Like american english and british english both have a standard non slanginformal speech form. Some people feel that neutralnon regionalized french must be France French. I would think that most French Canadians have more pride in themselves than that but... maybe not.Even if they  dont usually do the accent they often use expressions somewhat foreign to French people.

466822,0,t1_cftb641,Maybe its different in Qubec but where I am France its not rare to say for example a a eu fonctionn.  The difference between a a fonctionn and a a eu fonctionn is that the former implies some kind of present consequence whereas the latter implies that the consequence is also past.  E.g.gt Comment astu russi  sauver ce fichier?  Jai cliqu sur sauvegarder et a a fonctionn.versusgt  lpoque o tu utilisais ce programme comment faisaistu pour sauver un fichier? Je ne men suis servi quune fois jai eu cliqu sur sauvegarder et a a eu fonctionn.Of course the correct way to say this would be Je ne men suis servi quune fois je cliquai sur sauvegarder et a fonctionna.  The pass surcompos is then a way to avoid the pass simple but also avoid the link to the present that the pass compos suggests.  But the same logic makes it also transposable to the past as a plusqueparfait surcompos encoreplusqueparfait? viz.gt Je ne mtais servi quune fois de ce programme javais eu cliqu sur sauvegarder et a avait eu fonctionn.The nuance is very subtle though and basically the surcomposed tenses just add the idea of something further in the past and less relevant to the present mais peuttre quils ont eu t utiliss autrement.,French,cftbv1b,2,t5_2rd5t

So as an example je vais profiter deau meaning Im going to enjoy some water note Im a bit iffy if Im correctly using profiter to mean enjoy  L correct me if Im wrong .

1276407,0,t1_cid7etl,Yeah when I was saying theyre significantly different I meant the captions vs. the direct translations word for word. I understood that words in one language are usually translated to the most similar word in another but it definitely threw me for a loop hearing these words I know I know an extremely minute amount of french maybe slightly more than the average American and reading words that are not the translations of what I was hearing. Thats why I looked up the word for word translations to see if my French was as bad as I thought and it turned out I was pretty spot on with my own translations but my poor experience with French in both the grammatical and contextual sense was far worse than I realized. I couldnt decide if whoever made the captions had essentially created an entirely different song with his translation or if I was taking the words in the wrong context. Turns out it was a bit of both after reading from the post above. Thank you for your comment though with these two posts alone I have a grasp on what happened with the translations which has finally resolved my feverish obsession with them.

1759734,0,t3_2el5z3,French is French. If your teacher is from France or if she learned French from someone from France then they might use vocabulary from France. If your teacher is French Canadian or learned from a Frenchspeaking Canadian then theyll have a different accent and use a few different words. But...theyre both French. Canadian French isnt a dialect  its just French with a different accent and some different vocab like American English and British English.Im a Frenchspeaking Canadian although not from Quebec. Ive taught French immersion to children and adults. All of them find it easier to watch shows in Canadian French than in European French because most immersion teachers in Canada speak with a French Canadian accent which differ slightly from region to region but which are all more similar to one another than to European French accents.Most French as a Second Language teachers ie. working in English public schools as opposed to French or French Immersion public schools tend to be second language speakers themselves.In universities I think that the farther West you go the more European French it gets. I took a French literature course at a university in Hamilton. The professor and TAs all spoke Parisian French. One TA in particular always corrected my pronunciation although she did soften the blow by telling me that my accent was cute before showing me the RIGHT way to say things. Drove me crazy. Never took another university French course.But it was still French. University professors in various faculties in French universities in bilingual or francophone areas Eastern Ontario  Ottawa region Northern Ontario Quebec parts of Manitoba or New Brunswick will probably be a mix of Frenchspeakers from all around the world Canada Europe Africa Caribbean.TLDR It depends.

When you insult some one subtly  and unsubtly  over and over there is a breaking point.  Abuse the hammer for long enough and it will hit you on the fingers.    gtI never claimed to have not insulted her. Calling someone very very stupid however is not grounds for banning someone and her ridiculous overreaction could only be put down to her thinking her comments are for whatever reason not the colossal language failures that they are.    You sound like you are running scared. Would you have told an admin that they were fucking stupid? and if you were subsequently banned I think you would deserve it.    But to you shes a nobody on the internet a punching bag who cannot hit back.  So you join the wagon train for karma but you take it too far. Be warned. There has been a bit of a mod crack down.

2027146,0,t3_2hyvtu,When verbs have a direct object that is an object that isnt introduced by a preposition like de or  e.g. la souris mange le chat or je conduis ma voiture you can rephrase the sentence by replacing this object with a pronoun. The direct object pronouns are le and la depending on gender so those two sentences can be rephrased as la souris le mange and je la conduis.When verbs have an indirect object that is an object that is introduced by a preposition e.g. je pense  ma carrire and elle est convaincue de la validit scientifique de la phrnologie you can also rephrase the sentence by replacing this object with a pronoun. The indirect object pronouns are y replaces something that is introduced by the preposition  and en replaces something that is introduced by the preposition de so those two sentences can be rephrased as jy pense and elle en est convaincue respectively.In your case en doesnt really go with tre in that it wont be helpful for you to consider the verb in this sentence to be en tre.

But they arent blanket features used by all speakers all of the time. The situation is rather more nuanced and simply inserting them willynilly into your speech wont necessarily make you sound more French or make your communication in French more effective.Rather than trying to arbitrarily shoehorn these features into your speech if youre not yet fluent I would rather say that they are features that will be gradually acquired over time as part of the whole package of becoming fluent.

We tend to be very negative in our thinking some would call that realistic but eh and we will usually focus much more on difficulties or mistakes than on positive aspects. That means that if a French speaks  perfectly but makes one mistake like using a wrong construction or something thats what theyll remember theyll think oh fuck Im such an illiterate.From what Ive seen  and I may be mistaken of course!  the English speaking world tends to be a little bit more lax on this i.e. people wont beat themselves over some stupid mistake that they made because they spoke too fast.,French,cs1ks8c,4,t5_2rd5t

As a native speaker of French using prepositions in English remains the most difficult thing for me about the language.As for Assimil I think that the with Ease part is deceptive. Ive tried selfteaching methods in the past and found that the learning objectives i.e. the proficiency level youre supposed to reach at the end of the course were extremely ambitious with regards to the timeframe within which youre supposed to reach them to the point of being unrealistic.

4942774,0,t1_cuhdc1g,It bears noting in case OP is into grammar that there is a fundamental difference between the de in de argent which is elided and becomes dargent and the de in de largent. Although they are spelled and pronounced the same they are two very different words the former is a preposition like  avec par etc. while the latter is part of a twoword article most articles are only one word e.g. une les la etc..This is often confusing to learners because de la can be either  a preposition followed by an article or  just an article that happens to be in two words. And in both cases it becomes du in the masculine or de l if followed by a word starting with a vowel... so this similar behaviour reinforces the confusion.,French,cuhkqyg,10,t5_2rd5t

Hes very nice and we always do small talk when i can speak or when I pay him.Yesterday we talked a bit about the recent events about our feelings whether our friends had not been hurt.All of a sudden he said lets stop using vous  we are the same age you are a cool patient lets use tu. and I agreed. One consequence of this is that from now on instead of adressing to him with Docteur or Monsieur I can or must because it would be awkward call him by his first name.Switching to Tu is often a agreement between people who got to know each other.

8990095,0,t3_53eln5,I disagree with some of the advice here. A language is not a huge pile of memorisation the question why is that like that is a valuable one. Keep asking but look for the answers actively dont expect to be handed everything on a silver platter. Yes it may take some time but should you persevere you will be in the end better than your classmates OP youll need to start working on your own. Dont get scared you can do it. And it can be fun. Actually if you make it fun your brain will learn much faster and easier. Forcing yourself to every quarterhour of study that leads nowhere trust me. I tried.  Here is a list of resources you might likeseries Grammaire Progressive published by CLE levels dbutant and intermediare should contain the answers to all why is that like that questions. If your answer isnt there you will at least get a pretty good idea what is it exactly that you dont get. Asking the right questions which prove some work and thought behind them leads to better answers from teachers. These two levels should prepare you really well not only for your GSCE but as well for your further studies and for real use of the language. Solid grammar can save you lots of points in any kind of assignment!You might as well like other series by the same publishers Vocabulaire Progressif and Communication Progressive. I find them  fun as they are really well done comprehensive and very learner friendly despite or perhaps partially thanks to being monolingual. Lots of listening! That is something people often fail at and dont get enough practice. Yet it is the base for speaking it improves your comprehension and as well your pronunciation and speaking even though for that you need to listen much more and any practice helps. You can use the listening exercises for pronunciation and speaking practice as well repeating after audio trying to sound like the native is a highly underestimated activity. What course are you using in class? Listen to the CDs on your own again. Use podcasts like coffeebreakfrench frenchpod and so on. Lyricstraining.com is a good exercise as well. Starting your study session with a song may not be so bad what do you think?For vocab and some other things like conjugations you might like anki or memrise. Clozemaster is another good tool and linvist.io is very good as well even though I have my reservations towards itFor reading try lingua.ly which will serve you real newspaper articles based on the vocab you know let you save new words and review it a vocabulary snake game is awesome and actually useful! D . And you might be ready for Asterix or other BD bande desinne there are tons in French. That might make it more fun right now even if you are not ready for normal books yet.And some motivation. Tests are a bad motivation even though I totally understand how much it sucks to get bad grades despite trying hard I experienced that too just as most people. But if you learn French youll gain access to lots of original music tons of BDscomic books tons of awesome books great fantasy literature among other genres really a nice enrichement for anyone used to the anglophone one fun tv series commedies crime series and others movies tons of travelling opportunities.

9406096,0,t1_d989mp2,gt  adjective is the verb have no complement  Lexercice est difficile  finir Le dessert est agrable  manger Je suis facile  contenter La leon est rapide  apprendregt  adjectivede if the verb have an object complement  Il est difficile de faire ses devoirs ses devoir is COD of faire Il est facile dapprendre du nouveau vocabulaire du nouveau vocabulaire is COD of apprendre Cest plus long de prendre le raccourci le raccourci is COD of prendreNo thats not the right distinction. The difference is not based on whether the infinitive has complements its based on what role the components of the main sentence play in the subordinate. Ill give examples where I also put the subordinate as a standalone sentence to make this more clear. If the subject of the main sentence is the COD of the subordinate then use .     On finit lexercice. gt Lexercice est difficile  finir.     On mange le dessert. gt Le dessert est agrable  manger.     On me contente. gt Je suis facile  contenter.     On apprend la leon. gt La leon est rapide  apprendre. Note that what follows Il y a plays the role of the main sentences subject     On fait beaucoup de choses. gt Beaucoup de choses sont  faire. gt Il y a beaucoup de choses  faire. If the subject of the main sentence is also the subject of the subordinate then use nothing it depends on the verb of the main sentence and I dont think theres any way around learning them unfortunately.     Sometimes its nothing         Je cours. gt Je veux courir.         Je parle franais. gt Je sais parler franais.         Je rponds quelque chose. gt Je sais quoi rpondre.     Sometimes its          Je cours. gt Jarrive  courir. Je russis  courir.     Sometimes its de         Je cours. gt Jarrte de courir. Jvite de courir. Jessaie de courir. If the infinitive is actually the subject of the subordinate rather than its verb then use de. Note that in this case the English conversion also does some changes since the standalone sentence would generally use ing rather than to.     Entrer est interdit. gt Il est interdit dentrer. or Cest interdit dentrer.     Savoir semble difficile. gt Il semble difficile de savoir.EDIT I just realized that the rule when using nothing is not quite correct. It actually depends on the verb of the main sentence.,French,d98aefy,17,t5_2rd5t
