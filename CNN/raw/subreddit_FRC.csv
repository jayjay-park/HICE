31510,0,t3_1uh0at,I dont have any of ours to post right now but I will offer some advice.  This maybe helpful for people who are new to decision matrices or who have run into problems with them and perhaps not gotten what they wanted out of the process.  You have to be very careful when creating decision matrices.  They can be extremely helpful or they can easily be weighted in favor of one idea.  Essentially there are two big things to avoid  If the attributes youre assigning to the matrix arent quantifiable dont use them.  Its very easy to rank data its almost impossible to rank opinions or what ifs usefully.  Not only will using quantifiable attributes reduce the decisionmaking process to simply sorting data but it will make it much more difficult to weight the matrix in favor of one idea.  You may have someone who really wants to use swerve drive and will create a list of intangible attributes that make swerve sound great.  After developing building and testing you find that it wasnt the best idea for the game that year even though it sounded so great on the flawed decision matrix.  gtSome examples Speed is something quantifiable.  Certain drives will be faster than others this can be tested and observed and the data ranked easily.  Efficiency of drive tractive effort turn radius can all be tested.  Agility and maneuverability cannot.  All this being said there are some grey areas.  Reliability is a common attribute but without significant testing it shouldnt be used as an attribute.  If youve done a lot of testing with various drive types for example then you can use that data to support the ranking in the matrix.  But swerve seems a lot more reliable than mechanum or whatever applies is not a good way to use the tool. Decision matrices are not a democratic process.  If you made sure that all your attributes are quantifiable all you have to do is sort data.  When you invite a committee in to start arguing the usefulness of the tool breaks down.  People who like one system over another will argue for it regardless of what the data supports.  If this person is charismatic enough they may be able to sway the group to their way of thinking.  Dont let this happen.  Have enough people around to run the process and present the outcome to the team.  It can be discussed questioned and argued but if made your decisions based on accurate data youre fine.  As in any scientific or engineering process data is more important than feelings or coolness besides all robots are cool right?.TLDR Stick to what you can test not to what people want. Make good engineering choices.,FRC,cei0p6f,1,t5_2rdka

When NetBeans changes the files its Git and not GitExtensionsSourceTreeetc. that sees those changes. If you pick only one of WindowsMac and dont go cross platform however you wont have this issue.Therell be a new set or version of the plugins come kickoff but until then youre correct  the teams are using the  versions.Eclipse was definitely something we were interested in for the  season but there werent any plugins at kickoff.

2447579,0,t3_2ni4in,Im assuming the last couple pictures are your model. You dont need the x tubing to space off the bumpers between the wheels you can just just  or  gussets. Also vex makes some really nice and easy to use  cim  speed ball shifters that take up considerably less space than those gearboxes Id also be hesitant about putting your shifting cylinder on the outside of the gearbox. FRC can be pretty rough and its easy for one of those to get beat up.When youre making the hole pattern in your belly pan you also want one single solid strut that goes from one corner to the other instead of just doing a regular square pattern. This will greatly increase the strength of your belly pan to help prevent the frame from parallelogramming. Draw your two corner to corner struts then draw the rest of your struts parallel to those. Also consider the number of holes there are and the number of cuts to be made. Sometimes you can save a lot machine time and cost by making your struts a little thicker and the holes a little bigger.,FRC,cme84a9,3,t5_2rdka

3182624,0,t3_2wl56v, For qualifications write up a step by step procedure for this that you do best and think will take  minutes. Then have a contingency plan for when a few things go wrong. e.g. containers that you thought you would grab from the step during teleop were grabbed by the opposing alliance in Auto or picking up that first tote took  times longer than you expected. When you go to your Alliance partners during Qualification matches use this a your Primary Plan. Once you have this well defined and the whole drive team knows it work on a Secondary Plan this is what you do when another team on you alliance is better able to use the resources you planned to use. An example of this would be if you want to use the chute but are grouped with  other teams that may be able to stack faster than you from the chute. In this case what would your match look like if you needed to take totes from the landfill? Remember to be assertive about the capabilities of your robot you are confident in. Sometimes the more experience teams can sometimes be a bit pushy about how they think the game should go and can sometimes try and push you into a hole you are not suited for. Some of this applies to the scouting team but it can be almost as important as your driving.  Whenif you get to eliminations be prepared to throw everything out the window and do what your alliance captain needs. If you are in a District area and get the  hours out of the bag try not to use this time for mechanical work that is not strictly necessary. A few hours of practice with a functioning robot is miles better than no practice with a slightly better robot. This has always been true but this year I would anticipate that seconds are going to count and having more practice with the precision movements are going to be even more important. ,FRC,corvmuh,5,t5_2rdka

4399796,0,t3_3bf1vj,Experiment with students and mentors see what works best for you. Mentors tend to be a longterm choice because they can carry that experience forward but there are also teams who have been somewhat successful with student drive coaches. I would say pick the person who is best for the role whether theyre a student or mentor. Dont artificially cut off your options.Two important attributes you might consider when youre selecting someone are their aptitude for strategy and their ability to pay attention to several things at once. They need to watch what all six robots are doing point out opportunities for their drivers communicate with other drive coaches and decide if a robot on their alliance needs to change it up. If your robot isnt generally scoring a lot of points they may also need to give your driver strategic advice on playing defensively. If youre a young team who doesnt have much experience making powerful shooters or manipulators a drive coach who can help drivers play a really strong defense game can virtually guarantee you a place in the eliminations as long as next years game involves interaction between robots. It also helps if they can keep a cool head under pressure or can count points in their head. This year especially it was easy to lose your cool trying to keep up in points and take an unnecessary risk causing your alliance to lose. A drive coach who could go Dont worry we have enough points to go to the next round take it easy because they had the points counted in their head was a very valuable asset this year.,FRC,csllay7,8,t5_2rdka

Currently Gazebos Windows support isnt very good yet although they are going to improve it in a nearfuture release. However the current method of importing a robot into Gazebo involves exporting a URDF file from your CAD program and manually configuring it by writing a config file. Our simulator comes with an exporter that simplifies the process and allows you edit attributes such as joint and material information outside of the CAD program.In addition our simulator is aimed specifically towards FRC instead of general robotics though not to say that you couldnt import a nonFRC robot. In the future we plan to create a way to script the game pieces and the scoring system for each years competition.

6365300,0,t1_czcykpw,Overall I think its a good thing. Having more vendors to choose from helps keep prices down. Additionally should one vendor have an issue sourcing parts there are alternatives.The Rev Spark looks nice its price is quite low. It being only PWM is a downside to me. I havent used it or read much about it so I do not have an informed opinion on it yet.The SBB also looks fine although Im not sure if I like its layout. It has a similar linearity to other controllers. The . minimum voltage will catch teams off guard as I often see battery voltages rail down to v.From a CSA point of view it might be a slight pain since the SBB has firmware and is one more controller I should know how to flash and recover since I will see a broken one at an event. Everything that can break will break.  Additionally spare parts falls under a CSAs domain so its another item to keep track of if its even in spare parts.

A good way to address the issue of fairness while still allowing for the competition to be completed in a reasonable time period would be allowing reviews in the playoffs but not in quals. While it certainly sucks to lose any match due to bad calls it is not nearly as bad to lose a qualification match as it is to lose a playoff match and its already understood that qualification matches are very much subject to forces outside a teams control e.g. scheduling performance of alliance partners and thus have an inherent variability to them.,FRC,d0zh0ew,1,t5_2rdka

Once the score is committed its ready to be put up on the screen and is immediately published to the FIRST database where many other sites like The Blue Alliance pull their data from. But even after a score is committed the scorekeeper has the ability to go into the Match Review section of the FMS and make changes. This is what they have to do if the head referee decides to reverse a foul call. Im not sure they have the ability to change the score after the match like in years past I havent been behind the table yet this year. Theres absolutely no reason for a score to be that wrong and not be fixed.,FRC,d0zrds9,0,t5_2rdka

7049804,0,t1_d1fcl9s,We dont use the wpilib command pattern extensively when I say subsystem Im not referring to the wpilib subsystem classes but our own implementation.  We developed more efficient methods of handling subsystems that allowed greater multithread optimization as opposed to using the prebuilt architecture.  We only used wpilib calls for network tables and direct hardware interop setting motors reading sensors etc.  With that in mind we were able to develop systems that would not be easily possible with strict wpilib command pattern adherence.As to mapping multiple systems to a single button that is also completely possible and we did it.  By using an event callback pattern we could wire multiple event handlers subsystem operations to a single event raiser the button.  However you do have to consider the order of operationsexecution and whether one subsystem needs to fire its commands before a second subsystem can run.  This leads to  scenarios you could use an independent event handler separate from subsystem classes that executes subsystem calls in their distinct order to maintain sequenceofevents OR you can simply wire multiple events to a single button and have them all run concurrently.,FRC,d1fgbuj,1,t5_2rdka

My drive coach never instructed him to do so but I guess we will never truly know if it was intentional. But yes I do agree from that angle it does look somewhat intentional. It doesnt help that the bot weighed about  pounds.Edit We never lost contact with the bot however the robot did stop for a split second which is what makes it seem so intentional but we never backed up to ram it again.,FRC,d1yd044,4,t5_2rdka

The big respectpoint is dont loiter down on the floor just because youre wearing your teams media badge. Volunteers regularly check the media area and see if someones wearing a badge for a team that isnt in queueplaying  youll be sent right back off the dome floor to leave room for people whose teams are there. Space is tight down by the field especially this year Id imagine with all the field defenses needed to be stored someplace.

8311427,0,t1_d5ghhhf,Part !day   final day! The day will start with qualification matches. Before lunch alliance selection will occur. Im assuming that you know what alliances and stuff are. If you dont watch this s current game reveal video and maybe even skim read part of the  game manual. Anyway alliances in alliance selection are selected and made permanent for the rest of the competition. You will be very stressed by now but make sure to have fun stay calm remember that its not that important and that you have done so well this year to get where you are that if you dont get chosen or get eliminated in the coming matches you have done really well anyway and had a great time. Now alliance selection! Send a representative over to the field to participate in alliance selection. Alliance selection will then soon begin. The first ranked team can ask any other team to join their alliance including nd ranked team. However strategy means that sometimes it is better off to choose another team not just the next one on the list. If the first ranked team asks the second ranked team the second ranked team can accept or decline the invitation. If they accept everyone moves up and the second team walks over to the first team. If they decline the second ranked team cannot accept any other invitations and either is a captain of an alliance or doesnt play. Because of that if you are not a captain you basically want to accept and you generally want to accept anyways. After the first ranked team has made their choice repeating invitations in till someone accepts the second ranked team or whoever is in their place if they accepted st invitation now asks another team to join their alliance. This continues all the way down to the th alliance who asks a team to join their alliance and then asks another team to join their alliance. Then the th th th etc. All choose teams to join their alliance. Once that has happened for all alliances they will be  alliances made up of the alliance captain the team that formed it and a st and nd choice team. Elimination matches  st alliance will play th alliance nd play th rd play th and th play th. Each alliance plays the other alliance in a best of  you get time to fix the robot while other matches are played. Then a winner of each match is determined. Im going to assume that the top ranked alliance also wins but this normally never happens. st or th! plays th nd plays rd in another best of three things. Then the finals are played with st playing nd. Assuming regionals all of the winning alliance will be eligible to go to the world championship in either Houston or st louis its split from  onwards.. Awards ceremony will begin and the winner of the chairmans and rookie allstar award goes to champs too! you may want to look into applying for the rookie all star award. It helps to do some stuff to help the community and now is a good as time as any to start that! Youll also get to know the people in your team better and you can do these community events in a fun enjoyable way! And it helps the community. Plus you go to champs. Some other teams may go to champs on a wildcard  say the alliance captain of the winning alliance wins chairmans. Because they have qualified twice the judges will choose another team to go to champs. After awards which occur soon after the finals you go back clean up your pits and start loading out. And thats the regional competition!Tips for having fun at competions  Firstly EAT. Ive done  competitions now and it is easy to think youre ohsoimportant and theres ohsomuchtodo and theres just no time to eat. You are wrong. EAT. You cannot have fun or function unless you eat. If you are really busy you can just quickly down a few snacks. But really really try to during lunch find  or  minutes to sit down and EAT. Aside from that try to talk to other teams hear about how theyre going how their robot is stuff they did. Also my team does this and it sucks. When they play dancing songs and people in the stands are dancing this will happen during elimination matches a lot have fun lose some stress and dance. Youll see what I mean but trust me dont let your team have a culture of being boring at this time. It sucks. Um be friendly have the driver team do something when they say your name most teams just highfive the polycarb repeatedly thats fine however if you do nothing everyone will think your team is weird and boring. Dont be weird and boring. Have fun!Resources for technical and other help Chiefdelphi.com  the FRC forum. Avoid the many cancer threads and if people are mean ignore them.

OPR is a good metric to determine if a team is great good bad or ugly but its not much more precise than that.

10846388,0,t3_5v10rl,You could download the Google Sheets to Excel and then analyze them using Tableau Public Its a really cool tool and is intuitive. Id watch the first tutorial for it then after that just play around with some of their sample data sets Id suggest their NFL data set since its the most similar to FRC scouting data and youll be able to understand it pretty well. It personally took me about two hours of playing with it to get comfortable which is comparable to the amount of time it would take to teach yourself all the Excel functions youd want to know if you did it that way. If you use Tableau you literally dont have to use any functions in Excel all you have to do is have one sheet where each row is a teams single match data.While Tableau is far better for data visualization and more interactive than ExcelGoogle Sheets it is slightly limited in what kinds of calculations it can make. It can determine sums averages variation trend lines and basic things like that but it would be inconvenient to do something more complex like calculate an alliances expected score. If you arent planning on doing anything like calculating an alliances expected score Id recommend Tableau. If you do want to do something like that Id recommend learning Excel. The one specific thing you mentioned you wanted to do is rank the teams by various measures which IMO is easier to do in Tableau. Of course if youre willing to spend the time you could learn both. If you have questions about either please feel free to PM me and Ill do my best to answer.,FRC,ddyq8tl,2,t5_2rdka
