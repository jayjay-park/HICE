906092,0,t1_ch71wbh,How do you expect our legislators to maintain a second residence in DC for when they are in session travel around their statedistrict to meet with constituents when they are not and still remain above taking bribes to feed their families at hr? gtwe might get people running who understand what voters wantYou know who wants hr? People who make hr. You know who makes hr? Line cooks and cashiers in California. Is that really who you want running the country? I dont think youve really thought this all the way through especially considering that you are asking the White House to violate the Constitution for you.,government,ch7a13x,3,t5_2qh6z

4526282,0,t3_3cd5pq,If you are writing about a secret program then dont worry about the details of how an executive order works which is interesting but not so entertaining. Write about the Black Budget which is essentially a black hole where tons of money goes and there is virtually no public record or oversight besides a few members of congress. good article here In there the President can create whatever heshe wants. But to answer your question I think that an agency needs to be justified somehow within some sort of authorizing legislation. So for FEMA for example there is probably some law that says that the federal government can protect the public welfare during disasters maybe EPAs authorization legislation and based on that an executive order along with funding you need to get that from somewhere take it from DoJ community grants or from EPA fines or something and boom you have yourself a new agency. ,government,ct16bvh,2,t5_2qh6z
