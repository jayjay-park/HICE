2403527,0,t1_cm8s4ha,Well based on the formula above it should be working right in ..  In . though it isnt adding a . to the formula its multiplying your token bonus by  per level in Train Heroes.  Which is way stronger,TapTapInfinity,cm8s9d1,1,t5_34g65
2450664,0,t1_cmehurv,Its just cosmetic ... one of the oh so many future ideas is to make them drop different levels of gold or special items or infinity tokens or ... ,TapTapInfinity,cmelt4t,1,t5_34g65
2491743,0,t3_2o4nan,Its kind of odd to call a game with no ending and no point but increasing number generation as hard or easy.  I enjoy going to bed waking up buying a bunch of levels on Moosh and hammering out another  tokens before I head to work then coming home doing the same and earning another  before going Infinite its kind of the point of these games.Have you thought about offering a guardian that could accomplish what the OP is requesting while giving something in return?  I think game balance is fine right now it took me a long while to be able to hit level  and I only have a lifetime token count of  ishA guardian power that reduces offline income in exchange for some other type of bonus perhaps extra warriors?  I really dig the Gustav model and would consider giving up a large percentage of offline income to have one.  Of course he would have to be pretty powerful to offset the loss in power from offline income generation it would have to be a fair trade off but that could be possible.  You could even level up this power to increase the offline generation based upon the reduction or add additional warriors.,TapTapInfinity,cmjt4iv,1,t5_34g65
2513142,0,t3_2ofc1c,Hi the problem with completely nonanimated is that the d monsters will revert to their bind poses for most of them this will look a bit like theyre doing a star jump. There are some other things you can do in the latest version to improve performance though  dropping quality to ok turns off shadows dropping it to poor drops the target frame rate to  dropping it to the lowest level changes target fps to . Are you already running on the poor setting?Ive noticed that having max level option on the hero multi buy is a FPS hit as well the calcs needed to work out how many levels you can buy and what effect that will have are intense and they have to run every time gold changes.The latest version also has the option to turn off the coin labels which are a pretty intensive gpu load if youre powering through levels fast. Next improvements are to turn off all the scenery particle effects when changing levels which might make a small difference. Always looking for other possible performance enhancements let me know if any of that helps! ,TapTapInfinity,cmmlu12,1,t5_34g65
2534473,0,t1_cmpc22z,This sounds like a different issue gradual slowdown rather than everpresent lag caused by the multilevel hero buttons. Trying to replicate this now! ,TapTapInfinity,cmpe4hg,1,t5_34g65
2549897,0,t3_2oxfe2,Very cool.My save game wouldnt load if I had to hazard a guess it couldnt detect my Google account to link my power pack purchase but the game itself ran so I can totally see it working soon.,TapTapInfinity,cmreqcr,1,t5_34g65
2553779,0,t1_cmrwt7t,Its actually Lurch gt Aidith gt Moosh gt Zombo but theres some weird calculation before lala becomes better than moosh and maybe aidith. ,TapTapInfinity,cmrwzhj,1,t5_34g65

2749566,0,t3_2rjqxo,Hi there  Infinity Tokens are very similar to Souls they give  DPS but no tap damage each active Infinity Token and can be traded for Guardian Powers that add gold find etc. Whether its worth trading or not is up to the player!,TapTapInfinity,cngm47f,2,t5_34g65
2778883,0,t1_cnjr41h,Oh ok guess I misunderstood. Easily done will be in the next build ,TapTapInfinity,cnjy74x,1,t5_34g65
2788778,0,t3_2s0po2,Eh that would be way too hard to do. Just a lot of artwork for  developer and not completely a game changing update. It would be cool just probably wont happen.,TapTapInfinity,cnl2os1,1,t5_34g65

3230522,0,t1_cowold8,I figured out the bug.  I did EXACTLY what I did last time and its happening again.  I wanted to see what to buy next so I opened up the pzratnog calculator on my phone hit save data and copied it.  When I go back into my game I cant spend any.,TapTapInfinity,cowukls,1,t5_34g65
3231107,0,t1_cowwdut,Actually if you look at your second video your Fury was at level X when you couldnt level and when you closed and opened the app you were at X. Edit  this might be clearer to see on the video when you had trouble levelling you required  tokens to level but when you closed and returned to the app you required  tokens immediately.I also just tested out my theory and was able to replicate what I described in my earlier post. Offline idling in the Edge of Infinity is likely causing a number of problems. ,TapTapInfinity,cowwraq,1,t5_34g65

3785014,0,t1_cqng94j,Hey just wanted to say thanks to you and everyone else thats been cool about this. Yes its been stressful screwing up players games kinda the opposite of what you hope to do as a game dev! That said its been awesome to hear from a bunch of people who obviously really love the game! Have sent through the promo code  let me know if you have any issues still. ,TapTapInfinity,cqnpyvu,2,t5_34g65
3867706,0,t1_cqwyea8,The Reddit sidebar does say Looking for FAQs online calculators the full list of update notes or game formulae? Check out the WikiSeveral of the calculators also had their own posts here but theyve all been pushed out by question and suggestion posts. The Wiki is probably the best source of information about the game. The chat room on Kongregate is pretty good too I feel there are more experienced players in the chatroom than here on Reddit so you tend to get better answers.,TapTapInfinity,cqx5hk5,2,t5_34g65

4104267,0,t1_cro3qct,That says AdBlockAdAway not AdFree.  Theyre all so original and easily differentiated by their names! Ive never had a bar like that. It doesnt have features like perapp.  But just throwing it out if youre getting weird formatting elsewhere.,TapTapInfinity,cro40k0,1,t5_34g65
4119493,0,t1_crpuccm,I do not believe that would work but even if it did currently the game is single player if player A cheats its not like it effects player B. Its not as bad as it was in TT where there was tournaments that cheaters would hurt the progress of legitimate players.To add on to this it would be a pretty great addition I have actually wasted a lot of my spells by thinking they would work if I closed my phone and put it back in my pocket.  ,TapTapInfinity,crpuiwf,1,t5_34g65

4293257,0,t3_3a4zpb,Hi thanks for the feedback! The game has to make money somehow but clearly losing players isnt going to help that. The Gems purchases do also remove ads btw and free up the UI space they sit in so theres a lot more room on screen for everything.That said ... the next content update likely today! includes mystery gifts that can contain Gems or ranksspell resetsgold etc. so theyll be easier to earn.,TapTapInfinity,cs9klla,3,t5_34g65

My PC version seems to work logged in saved tried to reload a minute later and it said I had made more progress.I cannot load my save on Android.  I just got ...  It says Im logged in but it just sits there saying Loading cloud save ... doing nothing.edit uScaryBee mentioned he was working on serversgt Currently the biggest thing outstanding is to get the shop working which requires a new small server to be built to talk between Steam and the game. Perhaps he is transitioning cloud saves off of that thirdparty if he has to run his own server anyway.edit Yeah the Windows download link is no longer purple new URL but same version as before and it capped my connection instead of being slow as balls.  Hes probably messing with server stuff.,TapTapInfinity,cswux4j,1,t5_34g65
5002128,0,t1_cunhl0m,Not sure if your last sentence is implying using a  gem pack will give you half of your lifetime tokens ie like M but it only counts the tokens since you reset...otherwise ya rank  with hundreds of millions of tokens would be insane.,TapTapInfinity,cuoy04h,1,t5_34g65
