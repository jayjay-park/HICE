He also mentions it a couple different times in his Cosmic Trigger series. In that series he mentions a lot more of his occult experiences. Its sort of autobiographical. He covers a lot of different subjects and ideas from a personal angle in relation to his everyday life almost.One really sad story is about him having a vision of one of his sons dying. In a panic he begins doing spells rituals etc to hopefully stop it from materializing. Like a week later his daughter was beaten to death in a store she was working in after school. I think that life lesson is pretty selfexplanatory.,sorceryofthespectacle,ceo8kho,1,t5_2zojk

193676,0,t3_1wat71,The reason why an end of history thesis is invalid is because history never began.  The tools of evolution never belonged to nature  and while were at it  what are tools of evolution?  As far as I can tell creatures are still evolving and changing.  Humans in particular have chosen the mentalsupersocialtool path.  As far as Im concerned humans inventing new tools is a process of evolution by nature because it happens in a biological medium.All we are doing is simply creating simpler ways to store our social information.  Weve always been very material creatures  if were talking about the emergence of humans then one of our most defining features is the ability weve been able to create tools with.  Thats our evolutionary skill.What were really looking at here is how you view the world through what information youve been given and what fears and hopes you have instilled.  Now it is quite likely none of this religiomystic stuff will come to fruition in the way you expect it to but it is just plausible enough to be believable.

1444954,0,t1_cixbadz,I am not familiar enough with Land to address the connection but in the book its a kind of numogram that articulates the underlying politicalwar narrative of monotheism implicity of Islam but potentially all monotheistic narratives and the inevitable flattening or desertification of the earth that this monotheism wants to bring about as it achieves apocalypse. Its a symbol of the manifestation of the entity of oil as egregore or apocalyptic Lovecraftian godmonster. To quote the text directlyFrom CyclonopediaOil... is an autonomous chemical weapon bringing to earth both as a an entity and an event. Petroleum poisons Capital with absolute madness a planetary plague bleeding into economies mobilized by the technological singularities of civilization. In the wake of oil as an autonomous terrestrial conspirator capitalism is not a human symptom but a planetary inevitability. In other words Capitalism was here before human existence waiting for a host.The Cross of Akt is a numerological depiction of this. The Book implies some sort of Zoroastrian or preZoroastrian cult that worshipped oil and the central narrative is about some poor Iranian professor that is trying to unpack this secret.,sorceryofthespectacle,cixegjl,2,t5_2zojk

1549670,0,t1_cjafi6u,Thank you so much for this! I see what you mean in the first paragraph about the rhetoric. I am undisciplined in formal theories. gtHow can a perspective be universal? This seems like a contradiction in terms.  gtOtherwise what is the universal perspective and what makes it universal? What is the difference between fundamentally objective discussion mere objective discussion and mere discussion?This is difficult to describe so bear with me. In the simplest terms it would be the unbiased perspective of the universe itself. Taking into consideration everything we know about our reality and the nature of our experience. It sounds fantastical and thats part of the idea to get people to think about what it could mean. If there as one unbiased perspective what would it be?Discussion is often made from the reference of the ego and personal experience and interpretation. Objective discussion may properly leave the personal perspective out of it but may still be had within the confines of an identity like my town or my species. Eg. One neighbor may argue objectively that oil should be used for war and national security whie the other believes that contructive projects should be the priority. Both can make valuable cases but we arent talking about the real issue that oil is becoming scarce. gtWhere is transcendent thought necessary in the text that followsand if it isnt how can including it do anything other than weaken your argument?gtWhat makes a question right? And what makes an identified problem the wrong one to solve?Looking at the image of Chinese traffic we might ask How can we deal with congested traffic? How can we build cleaner combustion engines? Instead we may ask Why does everyone need a car? Why is work so far from home? Why are these items designed to break down? The right question is extremely important.gtHow do you know there are natural forces? More importantly how do you know that they correspond with reality.I know a lot of context is not given its partly intended to provoke thought. The natural forces that I have identified are based off of one thing resource scarcity.Throughout our evolution it has been a constant. Resource scarcity makes it necessary to exploit opportunities. That we exploit opportunities causes us to be fearful of competition. Greed corruption and fear are the results. Whatever our solutions are they should acknowledge this human landscape and prepare accordingly.gtThis is very onesided especially given your statement about perceived dualities... Nonduality is not just a license to be selfcontradictory!That nothing can be classified and everything is unique doesnt contradict that general favor swings between perceived dualities. When dealing with our common delusions it can be beneficial to see and navigate the perceived duality but our fabrications and views of the world come and go. What is meant is that our models are never perfect and they often only serve to shut our brains off with assumptions.gtWhy? Who gets to say what naturereality is and what constitutes fighting it? On what grounds?No one can say what it really is. Science never will but thats not to say it isnt useful. Often we learn what reality is with hindsight when we find out that something didnt work. A simple example of fighting nature is found in the monoculture statement. We try to make a perfect lawn. Will it ever be perfect? If we get it to that state will it stay there? The answer is no yet we keep doing it. This is a small example of fighting against nature. We should let it go.gt     Opposing nature often causes more harm than the problem itself.  gtAgain there is the assumption that you know what opposes nature. If there is nature what is outside nature to oppose it?Good! This is excellent. We sometimes assume that we are outside nature but it is not true at all. Everything we do is natural. So in this sense we are fighting amongst ourselves. Take the war on drugs for example. It would appear that people will do things which harm themselves regardless of law. We can outlaw guns but only the outlaws will have guns. These wars do not serve their stated purpose and are a waste of limited resources.gt    We can assume that people have their own best interests in mind.gtCan we? Why should we even if we can? And again how do we know nature?We should assume it because this is how evolution has worked already for billions of years. Do we need a better reason to assume its natural? Nature is what it is. I dont know how to get into the semantics of it. Perhaps the language is not adequate. gt It is natural to exploit opportunities for personal gain.gtHow is it natural?Limited resources means that we dont all automatically get everything we need. Therefore we must exploit opportunities to acquire it. I hope thats clear.gtYour identification of limited resources with reality doesnt take into account the increasing reality of digital resources information which can be copied and transmitted at ever decreasing cost. Why do you take part of reality i.e. extension the limited material resources you use as a paradigm case for the whole of reality including things such as logical and social operations and structures concepts desires affects etc?gtSocieties are based on the sharing of information.  Spoken language stored it in the mind alone.gtThis appears to be in contradiction with the materialist paradigm you set out before.I realize that not all resources are limited especially digital. The point of going to the limited resources point is that I believe it is the root of what has shaped us all competition for limited resources. Speaking evolutionarily over millionsbillions of years. The underlying behavior patterns required to survive and replicate in such an environment will not disappear just because we have evolved an advanced brain.Let me show you how this can lead to society. We compete for limited resources. A competitive environment shapes fear in our species. This fear manifests itself in grouping behaviors where we try to attain security in numbers and cooperation. Oral communication should accompany this as its required for coordination. The tribes thrive and once written language comes out we get an explosion of culture and communications from far away lands. Written word is used to effectively create more advanced settlements and power structures. Printing press and our advanced civilization is right around the corner. This view does not neglect the whole of reality it should be compatible with it. Thats the point of the universal perspective I just dont know how to word this.gt Blockchain based consensus to create balance between extreme centralization hierarchies and extreme decentralization anarchy.gt This is incomplete unless it is demonstrated that such a balance is required for what further goal? or desirable according to whose values?.Corruption is a result of our nature to exploit opportunities Im not even necessarily talking morally objectionable opportunities here when I say to exploit. Corruption is counter to the intent of the participants in a system. If we cannot stop corruption we will never be fairly governed or served. I could expand on that but I think it goes without saying. Blockchain based consensus can give us all access to see that the systems we participate in are fair for everyone. When things are seen as unfair you have things like the  movement instability.gt  The need for human trust within heirarchies is replaced with cryptography where possible.gtBut the need for human trust outside of hierarchies remains? Why should we replace human trust with cryptography?It does. We cant replace everything. For example you buy a vacation package online with Bitcoin. The vacation wasnt as expected and you want your money back. The merchant knows with certainty that you cannot steal the Bitcoin back. This is consensus the network agrees that you sent the money because you signed it with a private key. The network will not bend to your will no matter how much you want your money back. Responsibility is placed in your hands to have done the research before hand. There is no central power that will protect you its like cash including the freedom. We will never be able to design a system that stops people from scamming each other all we can do is make as much of it as open and transparent as possible to level the playing field. Consensus is the power.If we want to know why we should trplace human trust with cryptography its because human trust is very weak and fails often. Usually the problem is corruption exploited opportunities. Look at the federal reserve they have reduced the value of the dollar by  times in only  years and funnel hot money into approved markets like housing. As a society we would be upset if we realized this. It cannot happen with Bitcoin there is nothing to corrupt money becomes sound.About the CryptoTown stuff you are right it doesnt really belong. The purpose of this is an attempt to discover the proper rationale for blockchain based consensus and cryptocurrency in particular. The project promotes the adoption of cryptocurrencies through direct local action using directory and support structures called a CryptoMall.I have to thank you again so much for replying. I think this highlights the need for a more detailed piece. In logic and philosophy an argument is an attempt to persuade someone of something by giving reasons for accepting a particular conclusion as evident.Should I try to more clearly define my conclusion? Is it necessary to make an argument? Perhaps I have not stated I believe that X because ... and this is a problem. It was more designed to be a method instead of an assertion. I will work on the proper ordering of ideas and to define the argument. I really appreciate your response and will certainly be referring back to this as I proceed.,sorceryofthespectacle,cjaiw7z,1,t5_2zojk
1570005,0,t1_cjcp79v,gt If legitimacy of power comes from cause amp effect were all fucked..  ...will to power might makes right.I wouldnt presume to know what set of circumstances make an authority legitimate or even to define right and wrong  its subjective. I only assume that if it is legitimate the cause is the exercise of power through whatever channels to cause the right conditions in most minds. Maybe this is where I have little further to present. I am not sure what is beyond causality. If this is the dissonance felt through conflicting key signatures then I might have to qualify that my basic reasoning seem quite compatible with Hobbes but I am not sure if we reach the same conclusions. I thoroughly respect your recommendation but books are not my usual format as you might have guessed.As I understand his reasoning democratic or aristocratic rule does not produce the condition where the personal objectives of those in power are consistent with those of the ruled. He advocates for a monarchygtAnd though he be careful in his politic person to procure the common interest yet he is more or no less careful to procure the private good of himself his family kindred and friends and for the most part if the public interest chance to cross the private he prefers the private for the passions of men are commonly more potent than their reason. From whence it follows that where the public and private interest are most closely united there is the public most advanced.This is a description of corruption. I am not able to say exactly how but the blockchain can be used by both government and the governed to ensure that public and private interests are closely united.I hope this isnt tedious for you as it has been incredibly insightful for me.Edit Just to clarify I dont believe such a system itself will fix problems but if designed properly it can tap our collective creativity and may eventually be considered a legitimate source of authority.

2799274,0,t1_cnlq1yj,Its not a required but we are studying the spectacle which could be taken as everything you experience. When you are unkind to someone you are being unkind to a part of yourself. This can have ripple effects in your life because your choices train the universe to cater to you and if you are always being unkind to people than you will encounter more situations which elicit unkindness from you. This makes the spectacle problem worse. For example if no one replied to uimpracticalluggage he wouldnt really have been a problem. Plus by cutting ourselves off in this way we also lose an opportunity to heal a trauma within ourselves. When people trigger tension within group dynamics and are identified as a threat those people usually signal an archetypal role or energy which has not been integrated into the group the preventing the group from fully functioning. Hopefully uimpracticalluggages attack has immunized us against such intrusions in the futurethis is the sybil system from PsychoPass i.e. the Matrix and it is vile because it is the essence of normalization one main thing which keeps the spectacle running. If we cant understand and talk to someone like uimpracticalluggage with compassion and empathy then how many other people are we othering on a daily basis? If the groups immune system goes off that means it is not whole.So kindness is not a requirement but it can make the spectacle less powerful. When we try to make other people like usnormalsimilar to us we are only trying to copy our own egos into them to reprogram them into channels of behavior which suit our interests and moral territorialization. The copying behavior is the primary drive behind the spectacleviral dominance through sheer reproducability. All thingsall human brainsprocessing the same thing the same content.

4275134,0,t1_cs7h4yq,gt Cant one have their cake and eat it too? Being irrational is a free choice one compatible with the human dignity the Brights and other New Illuminated notwithstanding. If you choose to avail yourself of selfdefeating tools in the hopes that theyd carry you the extra mile you need before they break down completely only you can assess the risk and take the gamble. I am very conscious of the fact that my critique is potentially erasing and derailing if not in actuality because I consciously avoid deploying it in contexts where it would do more harm than good I try to be neither an ally nor an opposer out of ethical considerations.But this should be a tactical deployment not a strategic one. I believe that betting the farm on identity politics will be devastating for really marginal groups like you hinted at. At which point the collective stops pulling you up and starts dragging you down should be a continuous realtime analysis for everybody engaged in a class broadly speaking struggle.I also realize that my peripheral position makes me tend to minimize the very real struggles of central capitalist societies because paradoxically the lack of means goods and services affords many more lines of fugue not the least of which is a certain detached perspective. In other words I realize that even if they are first world problems they are no less problematic to those who have them in context. That is for instance the calls for equality marriage are no less important in the face of the egregious inequality of blacks in American society. To think otherwise invites utility equations of the type how many imprisoned black males equal one gay teen suicide and how many women victims of domestic violence equal one trans sex worker murder.Again if identity politics is a personal strategy deployed for short to mediumterm gains I have no problem with it as long as it is provisional and it is not functionalized into a false sense of agency. If its an analytical apparatus brought to bear from the ivory tower then I see it as a sorry farce because it benefits nobody outside those with tenure in posh Westcoast institutions. I find a wide chasm between hearing you dont listen to me because Im a woman to which I might stop and check my privilege and you must listen to me because I am a woman to which I would probably say not interested sorry. Change woman for Samoan or some other neutral or nonchallenged identity and see what I mean.,sorceryofthespectacle,cs7ixw7,1,t5_2zojk

4783394,0,t3_3gds4g,Jameson equates the postmodern waning of historicity with the cultural logic of late capitalism but he says little about why the two are synonymous. Why did the arrival of neoliberal postFordist capitalism lead to a culture of retrospection and pastiche? Perhaps we can venture a couple of provisional conjectures here. The first concerns consumption. Could it be that neoliberal capitalisms destruction of solidarity and security brought about a compensatory hungering for the wellestablished and the familiar?

4902268,0,t3_3i0o7z,Have you watched Dollhouse? I am rewatching it now and it is very onpoint.I agree there is a big overlap andor alliance between the spectacle and hyperreality. But asking whether they are the same thing is a question which takes two different concepts from two different conceptual worlds and tries to map them directly onto each other i.e. reductive thinking. That is fun and has its uses but more interesting would be to trace the two concepts in detail and compare them and then also insofar as they are separate entities in the wild to trace the ways they interact and reinforce each other.Im no expert on either author so I cant do a detailed look. But I can say that the spectacle is this whole network of causes which create this selfperpetuating media and political phenomenon. The reality this dynamo generates and pushes onto people relies heavily on hyperreality as a form of manipulation reward and control. It boxes people in so harshly that they cant even see the walls even when they look for them.So Id say they are different but complementary phenomena. But if you think of hyperreality as a place then it becomes more natural to think of them as more heavily overlapping. Maybe uzummi can speak to this point in terms of the Pleroma.,sorceryofthespectacle,cucgwef,3,t5_2zojk
4925419,0,t1_cufakvj,gt I want to leave all the mysticism out of Christs story for a moment. I want to get to the heart of where the modern idea of politics comes from. Im not claiming Jesus to necessarily be the first homopoliticus in western dress but he is definitely at the heart of this impulse.Isnt that what Xianity basically did?  They reframed the myth to fit their own agenda?  It seems like a dangerous game to me... if we arent using the myth to point us back to what we are then it seems to me were creating exactly what one is seeking to destroy through all that revolutionary rabblerousing.  Jesus defied convention and simultaneously pointed to something deeper.  Lets say politics consumes itself then what? Somethings got to take its place and what that is will be dictated by the governing mythology I think.  gtBecause I think Clamoring beneath the surface here is  people who want to get all political and revolutionary and collectivist in some contemporary agentive fashion.

5083894,0,t3_3klt6n,Well it seems that from your reading of Freud he never really understood Hegels Dialectic.   Hegel states that after initial perception and after differentiation there is a state of unity.  Here is the tricky part for you and probably many gnostics as well is that the stage of unity is completely unlike the other two stages.   It is not simply a combination of the two or the best of both it is a new being and a complete realization of what the other two were supposed to be.  But the initial virtue of the previous two stages of the dialectic cannot be known until the final stage.   So the gnostic approach has a tall order. I think you are dead right on your first point though.  What you are talking about strikes me as a kind of Cartesian gnosticism there is the world as it is and then there is the transcendent aspect of you mainly doubt and spirituality that can lead you out of this bland situation.   But that doesnt work because what is free will?  And how do I know when I have reached the end of the dialectic?  I think that the essential pro of Gnosticism is that it allows knowledge in the spiritual to be an unregulated commodity.   And I think this is actually a very valuable thing.   because a gnostic might have the abilty to surrender to the unknown as they should but it is likely that they wont and enter into this kind of Cartesian Gnosticism where they enter into the world essentially waiting for what they might think be the end of the dialectic.   But who knows? ,sorceryofthespectacle,cuyswkj,1,t5_2zojk
