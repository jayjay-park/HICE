6370734,0,t3_42x6t0,Ok been in betting for a while but never heard about something like this. I wouldve been suprised just like you if i would recieve the money back in case of a draw and of course i wouldve bet again and again to gain a lot from this rule. But if suddenly the TOS is changed and I know that I recieve my money back in case of a draw and I dont recieve them back without any big announcement that the TOS is changed of course its their fault and they must pay for their faults. Been betting a lot on a lot of websites and always a TOS change was signaled with a banner on the website header. Youll win for sure dont give up you can win even more than that if you want because as I see their support is like made from yrs old kids who dont know the law. ,fanobet,czds682,1,t5_39reo

6536582,0,t3_454sjy,It seems that the Fanobet admins cannot tell the difference between CET and CEST. Seems to be the problem here. It seems that the times listed are in fact in CET and not the stated CEST.,fanobet,czvfof8,2,t5_39reo
