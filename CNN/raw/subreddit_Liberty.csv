So he is actually going to stop the fines by explaining how he is performing natural gardening.Those are potatoes not pictures but I can still see his yard is kept free of trash. He has logs for biodiversity. They are not arranged in a grid as in a traditional Western aesthetic but are placed in harmony with the landscape he is gently guiding and the Eastern philosophy he is using.I dont know anything about you but I have lived on farms and in the country and I have seen podunk spots where trash comes in people and plastic.

Rebloged conspiracy sites say hes being persecuted for this patriot pledge stuff real news sites say hes got problems with the TSA and has been placed on administrative leave for attempting to fly under an assumed name.  If the guy wanted to change his name he should  have gone to the courthouse like anyone else and it was bone stupid trying to fly with tickets under one name and ID under another.,Liberty,cf5y2u9,-1,t5_2qhfm
