5420699,0,t1_cw4gzsj,Ive used them to pour ingots but you have to cut the can off because of the ridges. Not sure if they would hold up too long as a crucible or not.,Metalfoundry,cw4jv5d,1,t5_2z8jq
5983131,0,t1_cy3wzmi,Most likely yes. It was when I was very new to casting and was casting directly into RTV silicone moulds. There might have been water in the mould or some other idiotic thing I did wrong. ,Metalfoundry,cy3x4eb,1,t5_2z8jq

7368587,0,t1_d25fxb9,I will most certainly make it less durable since i am using scrap material that is not specifically designed to withstand such temperatures but it is more the proof of principle i am trying to achieve.Also i want the blower to feed the heat exchanger so it will not have to pump hot air.,Metalfoundry,d2fr9v4,1,t5_2z8jq
7413416,0,t3_4grv2h,Ill be honest with you Im worried on your behalf. First I think its great youre following a passion.  And far be it from me to discourage that. I think youre going to be disappointed when all is said and done.  From everything Ive read youre going to go struggle to make a set of armor that youre not going to be able to wear.  Pushing process limitations I would say you could get away with th wall thickness and make something wearable.  But youre not set up for success there.If it has to be metal switch to sheet aluminum.  cast the insignia and details but do the bulk of the armor in sheet.   Im not trying to rain on your parade I just think youll be happier with the result going about it another way. ,Metalfoundry,d2kuuuk,2,t5_2z8jq

11019294,0,t3_5xcdhe,I use an old cornbread pan that makes fruit shapes.  Cast iron is the way to go.  Make sure you set it up on bricks so you dont burn whatever it is setting on.  Mine pop out with no issue.  You can find them in antique stores for pretty cheap.,Metalfoundry,deh08lb,2,t5_2z8jq

11466655,0,t1_dfvoxyw,Ah the way you wrote it you sounded like you were talking about using one of those hunks of scrap.Carving the shape from wood is way easier. That can even be done with handtools or just a Dremel.If youre able to protect yourself from steamburns you can extend the lifespan of your wood form by soaking the block in water.I cant remember the price I paid for mine but I remember it being much cheaper than Id expected. They arent as collectable as anvils plus theres a handful of people making those smaller ish pounds blocks out of ductile castiron and then selling them with no finishing work. As mentioned it takes a few hours attacking the surfaces with grinders to get them usably smooth but for hobbyists that works out just great.,Metalfoundry,dfvqltu,2,t5_2z8jq
