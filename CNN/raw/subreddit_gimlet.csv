4048510,0,t1_crhmddx,I agree not really a stand out debut episode.  I would say I was mildly amused.  But it was also fairly forgettable. I like all of Gimlets podcasts but they are all very podcasty.  What I mean is they are not really doing anything different with the medium.  Actually the first season of startup felt that way like it was really using all of the strengths of audio.  This one just seems like a slightly above average segment of This American Life not that there is anything wrong with that just not terribly exciting.That being said I will withhold final judgment on Mystery Show until I have heard a few more episodes.  And to be honest even if is not that spectacular it is still better than a lot of podcasts out there and the production quality is good.,gimlet,crhrf6a,8,t5_34ja6

Its not about how much a company is currently worth but what it could be potential be worth by looking at a combination of factors.  Overall its not very scientific and theyve only hurt themselves if investors think theyre overvalued.

7588688,0,t1_d34pzgm,gtWhen you read or listen to her quotes youre referring to the statements that you make are a very skewed reading of that.If thats your interpretation thats fine I disagree but thats why I included the context of the audio so people can make their own decisionsgtTheres no other word for it than bullying.That is a huge leap to make. Lets think about this. Gimlet recently raised a  million dollar round to produce more shows and market them. One of the shows they chose to sponsor and produce is a show by the subject of my Medium article Brittany Luse. They gave Brittany Luse a national platform on their show to speak her mind to a waiting audience of podcast listeners that Gimlet has already acquired through other quality programming. I listened to Brittany Luses side project podcast which she mentioned on Sampler and Startup and discovered a slightly less constrained Brittany Luse who said some extremely nasty things about people because of the color of their skin or because of their economic background or because of the way they wear their hair. After hearing this I created a facebook page and a Medium post to expose the things shes said about other people. I never denigrate her for the reasons she denigrates other people and I quote her as directly and as factually as I possibly can. I have no national platform and I dont even have  to spend on advertising my opposition to her while she and Gimlet have  million to spread their views. However despite all of this you believe Im bullying her? Would you say BLM supporters were bullying Trump by shutting down his rally?Would you say protestors were bullying chikfila president Dan Cathy?Would you say the Food network was bullying Paula Deen for canceling her TV show?No. Im doing all I can to expose her hateful views but I am in no way bullying her. ,gimlet,d34sotj,3,t5_34ja6

Brittany Yeah     White people are coopting racial humor and coopting white people be white jokes which is one of my great joys. Discrimination      The only white men that speak in the movie are French. They dont even speak english so they cant even express anything. Like all of the white people in this movie are rendered irrelevant and speechless.      I actually think I only see black movies in theaters.      Targeting is were actively trying to make our organization less white. So were gonna do these things. Cause were actively trying... Were trying to go outside our networks to find talented people who are not white. Targeting is fine for me. Prejudice      Im not comin for all white girls right now but Taylor Swift definitely reeks of White Girl Desperation.     If you saw any black faces in the line of partners theyre gonna be you know... light brights or possibly ethnically ambiguous and you know the wavy hair and the whole...

9169599,0,t1_d8dumwf,Im not too far into it but I find myself agreeing with you here. I really liked season  it had an intimacy to it that felt like it actually got under the skin of all the fetishized startup stereotypes and wanky stories about startup culture and had some great moments in it. And then season  comes along and delivers all of those stereotypes with deadpan seriousness. I mean the line that starts its like Uber but for... is practically a joke format in itself but its right there in every episode delivered with complete earnestness and replete with every hackneyed stereotype about startups.     Im about  episodes into season  and really struggling to maintain interest. I think I burned through the first season in  days and have been dawdling through the second season for  weeks the intrigue just isnt there and Im mostly listening for the updates on Gimlet. Im considering just skipping to season  I dont know what it is but the Dating Ring is kind of making me hate the show. Im not sure if its because they picked a business that sounds incredibly dull to me or the focus is too much on Lauren who I find soporific I think Id really enjoy the show if they made Katie the lead on it though.     Any suggestion on whether it would make sense to skip to season ? Or is it going to be too confusing and its better to wade through the rest of season  first? ,gimlet,d8ebco8,8,t5_34ja6
9196394,0,t3_569k3u,I posted this to another thread and am reposting it here I dont think this is about VC funding. Notice that Starlee says she lost her job her benefits her staff  these things cost money. It had been  months since shed created anything whose cost could be offset by selling ads. Gimlet is a company. It does not yet? have the luxury of sustaining any project whose costs it cannot recover. It cant carry a lossleader. It sounds as if they gave Starlee a lot of time and options and she still didnt deliver. Yes she may be a genius and Mystery Show may be the best podcast of all time I dont actually think either of those things the way some do but Gimlet isnt set up as a charity for artistic geniuses who cant deliver. Thats not what Gimlet is. I totally support their decision. And I see why they were not in a position to keep listeners informed as this all played out.,gimlet,d8hplfe,32,t5_34ja6
9235255,0,t1_d8mmjvu,We dont actually know that one way or the other though. A lot of what we think happened is just speculation because Gimlet are hedging about it. From Starlees Facebook post it sounds like she was summarily fired. From Gimlets post it sounds like she was let go but allowed to keep producing the show freelance. Maybe. Was it with a budget or not? We dont know. Their communication on this topic has been so bad we dont know anything for certain.But one thing I do know six months ago they could have said The way this show has been produced has changed and we dont know when season  will be rather than what theyve been saying the last six months which is nothing.

10641861,0,t1_ddardtf,Im basically with you but I dont think the other podcasts are necessarily failed concepts. I think most of Gimlets podcasts had a lot of fans at some point and I think Gimlet is pretty clear about their purpose they make highquality narrative podcasts. Thats what all their best shows or mostloved shows have in common and thats what theyre good at. There are shows that were solid for like half a season and then fell off but those just didnt have any more stories to be told. My guess is they arent regretful that they made those shows they just are done with them because theres no more that needs to be said there. I really think this is why they shouldnt do a political show thats a completely different skillset. I listen to a lot of political podcasts as well Weeds Pod Save America  occasionally some Slate shows and stuff but I like those for what they are a few knowledgeable people sitting around and talking about topical things. I like Gimlet for highquality narrative podcasts. Its possible they could come at a political show from a different angle I think Vox has a show in the pipelines about how policy affects real people and that sounds like something Gimlet could do. But generally I think they just need to figure out which stories need to be told but arent and then they need to go tell them. The times they figure that out are the beginnings of their best shows. I havent really checked out their newest slate of shows so I dunno maybe Twice Removed or Crimetown or Homecoming is that show or maybe it isnt. But I think theres a lot of cynicism around here about Gimlets motivations with their shows and I think its unfair I think Gimlets very clear about the kind of content they want to make and theyre just trying out different things to figure out which stories need telling. I have faith that theyll hit upon it again even if every show they make isnt consistently fantastic anymore. They still make some great content.,gimlet,dddmke9,3,t5_34ja6
