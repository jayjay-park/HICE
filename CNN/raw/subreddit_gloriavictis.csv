8192813,0,t3_4rdt3h,I am a new player and low level just dabbing into the game and seeing if it is legit enough to invest my time. So far I like it. I mean it isnt the best graphics it is awkward  to move around sometimes etc. But there is something about it that makes me want to play some more so that is good.   Your guide is helpful. Adding in some other basics like ctrl  LMB to sell stacks or whatever would be nice for new players. It took me a google search to figure that out...no biggie. But having all those sort of tips in one spot would be great.  Also PVP may not be helpful but even as a new lowbie player I had a lot of fun in the two tournaments I was in. I was too low to do any melee damage because I would get oneshot...but I enjoyed sniping from the walls while others tanked.  fun game.  edit actually I do have a questions  would it be better to process the logs or raw materials and then selling them so that you get your crafting levels up? Or just better to sell as raw mats?,gloriavictis,d51niww,1,t5_2yymv
