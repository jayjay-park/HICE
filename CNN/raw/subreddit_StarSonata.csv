1745541,0,t1_cjrinsh,The old teams are dying Jeff. The core pps are leaving and selling off their accounts or letting them rot. Yea we have new players coming but once all the old players who are willing to teach them how the game works quit none of them will make it through t.Find me a noob willing to spend the time it takes to learn what the entire C playerbase knew and shared and that noob will still have hell to go through to level up to k by himself and learn how to make a t ship.Try to explain Adamantiumized Modules to a pp noob. Good luck.Try Colonies. Try T Modules. Explain how the math of hostility and aggro and dps and electrical tempering works. New players aug setups are totally shit. They try to do content and complain until someone gives them a setup that has been TRIED before and works. That setup works. New players do not think for themselves nor can they afford to experiment. They want cookie cutter setups so the old players hand them down.Once the old core leaves....your game dies.,StarSonata,cjz6pt9,0,t5_2th5q
