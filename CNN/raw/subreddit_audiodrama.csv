8280738,0,t1_d5c0t11,gt This was awesome! Keep up the good work. Only critique I have is that I think the trumpet player was playing a sax  not a huge deal though. Thanks for sharing looking forward to episode two!You are absolutely right. When I was doing the original Edit I had no Trumpet sound except from Jazz bands. I used logic pro. My girlfriend suggested I get one of the internet. Lol. I told her I preferred not to get in trouble for using someone elses work. I appreciate the feedback! I will try to be more accurate in the future episode. ,audiodrama,d5cnget,2,t5_2s7g2

Anyhow as I systematically raid its treasures I felt it would only be fair to submit my own humble contribution to the trove.

9119266,0,t1_d80oazc,I like my dnd light hearted as well so the best two Ive found that do this well is adventure zone and tabletop eacapades. The adventure zone is more on the rail story driven and isnt as true to the game but fantastic all the same. Tabletop escapades is a more sandbox style and true to the gaming dynamics of dnd but us really good story wise as well.,audiodrama,d87zkfr,2,t5_2s7g2

10985807,0,t3_5v6aen,yeah all of the above. My main issue was learning to edit sound with audacity yay for youtube videos   to which add finding a quiet recording location and getting a good microphone for live location recordings. We have one but it only plugs into a camera and found for some reason that a digital camera works in movie mode and so does video app on my small samsung tablet which is a phone so the mic is not too bad but the audio ony recording apps on a small tablet suck. Its not the mic. SO weirdly we record remotely as video and then strip theaudio off. i would like to do more of our own sound effects. while we have free studio at the community radio station arent we lucky! remote recording requires some ingenuity  the blanket cave the car. we did an alien cafeteria scene with one of the actors recorded in studio and my son while sidelined in hospital during his lunch  that was our introduction to field recording. Turns out I really like the sound so much better than a small studio. interesting when we got it to editing fiddling with the equalizer on the studio recorded character then dropping a cafeteria soundscape around them both came up nice. one of the main issues I see is that people dont get together enough to brainstorm through the first draft of a script. The writers seem to think they can do it in isolation but theres plot holes and its all too easy for a script writer who is focussed on getting the plot to work to be a bit lazy and rely on tropes. Getting realistic dialogue sometimes only happens during a take editing the script on the fly. Once we talk it through ideas bounce around.  Helpful is a mobilephone plan with unlimited talk we edited one of the scripts in real time together on googledrive and we made a facebook group for the actorsscriptwriters and another for our audience.,audiodrama,ded7ft2,2,t5_2s7g2
