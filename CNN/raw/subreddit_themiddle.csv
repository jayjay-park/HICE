6644306,0,t3_46jvgw,i think part of his tics was to help him stand out. u can make a socially withdrawn kid without tics but having them gave him some more flair lol. its also not to uncommon for kids to have them and its even more common for them to grow out of them. as he grew up i think the viewer could appreciate him for just being him. now they seem to be used more sparingly with an intention in mind. but im just guessing.,themiddle,d06kujs,4,t5_2t92t

The Middle seems to have done a great job staying consistent for  years and incorporating the changes with everyone growing up in a natural way. Its still funny. Still gets decent ratings. Sure theres a clunker episode here and there but for the most part its remained very strong for an extraordinary length of time. ,themiddle,d928f65,3,t5_2t92t
