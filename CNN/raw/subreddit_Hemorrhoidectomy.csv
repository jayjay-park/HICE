2794808,0,t3_2m7829,I had my hemorrhoidectomy about three weeks ago. I feel your pain! My main concern is the amount of swelling I have. It literally looks worse down there than it did before. The swollen mass is tender and it honestly feels like the hemorrhoid did to begin with. Did you experience this? I got told by my doctor that it will go away but Ive been reading a forum and most people who experienced the swelling say it does not go away and an additional surgery is required to take care of it. ,Hemorrhoidectomy,cnlrcb7,1,t5_34j9t
