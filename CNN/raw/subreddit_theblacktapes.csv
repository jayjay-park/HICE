5009223,0,t3_3hxqh3,I feel like its very much geared to follow something like Serial or the programming on NPR. Thats what it reminds me of anyway. I personally enjoy it. I feel like it better blurs the line between reality and fiction by operating how an NPR program would.,theblacktapes,cupsu10,1,t5_38hjw
5136664,0,t3_3lcif3,In my opinion Alex and Strands voices fit their personalities a gogetter Agent Mulder reporter and a Scullylike scholar insert typical sexy voice comment here respectively like a glove.Like Nurse said the accents can be improved. But at this point Im so invested with the story itll have to take a serious snafu for me to stop listening all together. ,theblacktapes,cv55r96,5,t5_38hjw

5256017,0,t1_cvcoue3,I just watched the HBO or Showtime?? we miniseries about Houdini and most of it is him arguing with his wife about how shes crazy for believing fortune tellers and he just goes around to them to disprove them. The entire time I was watching it I was just like STRAND. IT YOU. ,theblacktapes,cvjjds9,2,t5_38hjw

5353040,0,t1_cvvffeu,gt So he switched from agnostic to skeptic not because he actually felt that way but because the alternative was unsafe.This begs the question though  if youre just paying skepticism lip service and you really do believe youre not really a skeptic and therefore in the exact same amount of danger.  One cant simply say they switch beliefs and have it be so. If you secretly do still believe in the paranormal God Satan etc then you do and no matter what you tell people the belief is still there. Thats the tricky thing about belief.,theblacktapes,cvvwtdi,2,t5_38hjw
5402847,0,t1_cw16jqg,Exactly! I had hope that it would be something about TBT but I knew it was going to be a peak of Tanis. Actually This American Life did the exact same thing with Serial. They knew that most of their audience wasnt going to be listening via podcast so they broadcasted the first episode to give it background. I think it makes sense I was just a tad disappointed we didnt get ANY TBT. But really  amazing free content? Cant complain. ,theblacktapes,cw29uwu,2,t5_38hjw
