20983,0,t1_cegrpx3,cranio doesnt get used by most DOs and many DOs dont think there is any basis to them.  however that is a small aspect of OMM.  OMM can be used very well and can treat a lot of problems.  how do I know? my sciatica was completely cured by a DO using OMM after MDs failed to make any permanent fix.  as a result I applied to only DO schools and Ive been accepted.  theres a reason why DOs can get into top tier PMampR programs.  OMM does give you a thorough understanding of the muskuloskeletal system and how it can be manipulated to get some results.  and if that doesnt work then they can prescribe medications or try other therapies.  not all DOs use or believe OMM works but personally i know it works for me. n the plural of anecdote  data i know but still many people will attest to this.  Thats why a DO who opens an OMM clinic in a city can fill up their schedule in no time.  people spread the word and it spreads fast and wide,medicalschool,cegtlqy,7,t5_2re2p

51454,0,t3_1uowf8,What score do you want? A ? You dont need to hit it hard. You might get  questions on obscure anatomy. Im sure you remember a lot of the basics. If you want the crazy high scores. Then I would highly recommend doing  things. . Learn clinical anatomy scenarios. Common fractures and dislocations that hit nerves. Classic muscle injuries and fractures. How does a torn meniscus look? What does the A in ACL mean ie. is it the femur or tibial attachment  for when they show you a picture of a torn APCL. Where do watershed infarcts happen in both the brain and gut?Those are topics that fit great into a clinical vignette and are therefore highly testable. . Memorizes testable subjects. Knowing the odd intercostal nerve that goes to the umbilicus T isnt as useful as you might think but know the brachial plexus inside and out as in they might show you a diagram and point to a place and say whats this? For  First Aid is amazing. They provide all of the common arm nerve issues which are the most tested with lateral femoral cutaneous and common fibular. I would then print out a picture of the brachial plexus and just memorize it. Edit As I do when I give all Step  advice I got a  for reference. ,medicalschool,cekae5g,9,t5_2re2p

106608,0,t3_1v9c6a,It depends on why they are asking I think. Many preceptors are always like So how did the boards go and I think thats a different question and you can answer or not as you like. Sometimes theyre just being friendly or asking about your academic performance in line with giving advice for your future residency applications strategies. If theyre asking so they can use them for their supposedly subjective evaluations or for any reason then you are well within your FERPA rights to say no. If they pressure you you can go to your ombudsman or whomever the equivalent is at your school for support in not disclosing them unless they really do need to have them to do their job as an educator which doesnt sound like this is the case in your situation. To answer your question I think it really only violates a legal boundary if they get hold of them without your permission. Ethically and professionally it depends as always on the intent and context. Friendlier advice type situations it doesnt really pose a problem but if theyre trying to get them so they can use numbers to change their subjective evaluations to be more accurate then yes there is probably something to that. ,medicalschool,ceqkhic,1,t5_2re2p

181771,0,t1_cez2si8,Well I think the challenges in pathology are different to those of other specialties and it is really difficult to compare. Pathology is very theory based so we have to read a lot and remember a lot of the medical school basic science in order to function effectively. In contrast most clinical specialties require constant interaction with patients and other hospital staff in a rather stressful environment. There is a lot of on your feet thinking where quick decisions need to be made and the knowledge you need to make these decisions also takes hard work to learn. Medical specialists have to know about medication doses and drug interactions. Surgeons have to know the various surgical approaches and how to handle complications. Pathologists do not have to know any of those things.So really it is challenging yes but so is any other specialty. It is just a different kind of challenging!,medicalschool,cez52ev,2,t5_2re2p

202442,0,t3_1wdpua,Ok so I am sort of coming from a similar situation. Finished high school in  years finished college in  years then straight to medical school. I am currently in my fifth clinical rotation MS and... Im fine. When I first started clinicals I had the same fear of not having enough experience in the medical field. Other students had previously been nurses medical assistants or or least had some kids! How could I ever catch up? Well after a few months I did catch up and I can honestly say that I feel like we are all on the same playing field. Sure they knew a lot more about hospitals and what went on in them when we first started IM but after  weeks or so... I knew all the same stuff. Dont be afraid to have a more basic medical background.. youre going to have to learn it for the first time eventually anyways and being a student is great for that! Honestly being a student is the best. Nobody actually expects you to know the best diagnosis treatment plan etc. Youre there to learn! Now is the time to mess things up and get a little messy... before your signature counts!I am  years old I will graduate at . Being a doctor will be my first real job. Take advantage of your situation. You are young assuming you are based off your post and you will thank yourself for starting younger when you decide you want other things family travel etc. Youll pay off debt sooner. You can do it! Dont doubt yourself now. Now is the time to work even harder! Socially I am pretty outgoing and made a lot of friends in school Caribbean school atmosphere might have helped!. Find a social outlet wherever your rotations are... I had a friend that joined a local kickball team and those people ended up being her social outlet. I am sure there are plenty of other things of that nature you could get involved in.So I havnet slept in way to long so I refuse to spell check this.

224554,0,t1_cf3m9rj,this. I do research in a fMRI lab and before you analyze the data you have to preprocess the data and one of the steps is called coregistration where you maximize the similarities between the functional and anatomical images. although the computer does that you must check the coregistration to see if it has happened properly. Since it is a royal pain in the ass i asked my PI why there wasnt a program to do this and he said no software or program has been really made or is close to being made that can match the acuity of the human eye when it comes to checking coregistration and mind you this step is super simple. you literally just see if ventricles and other structures are aligned properly.

In the last two years clinical years the portability of the laptop becomes more important especially battery life. I suppose its different from rotation to rotation but generally being able to have a decent typing ability on a computer thats easy to carry around and has  hours battery life would be great to carry around during rounds and to type notes etc. If theres money to spare a inch macbook air would be a godsend.

949640,0,t3_24znbv,First off you are correct in saying that USMLE scores and rotations grades are gtgtgtgt first two years grades. It sounds like you are pretty much sitting just below average which is ok! Sitting in the bottom half is also ok! Shit being dead last is ok as long as you have good USMLE and clinical scores and didnt get and F or MP in any classes. Now to address the fact that you would like to score higher. Keep in mind that most professorsdocs who write these tests are writing them based off of that they think is important regardless if it is in FA or not. It is my impression that you are only using FA to study for your exams and that seems to be enough to be average. If you want to up your score you need to focus more on the lecture material and what your professors emphasize in class and use FA as a supplement. If after trying this you dont see your scores rise then you might just be a middle of the pack student which is perfectly ok. Someone has to be there and we all end up with an MDDO at the end of our names when its all said and done. Best of luck let me know if you have any more questions.,medicalschool,chc8cui,23,t5_2re2p

1304945,0,t3_290uij,Number one thing to think about is whether you seek to apply into a super competitive specialty. Firstly I want you to temporarily forget the whole what is ranked important for being selected into a residency because it really doesnt capture the process of ranking a candidate. I instead want you to think about how the whole sorting process works systematically. First you are broadly ranked according to strict universally standard numerical criteria i.e. Step  score typically or a weighted composite of Step  and Step  multiplied by some sort of standardized numerical factor your clinical grades which are converted into some sort of standardized numerical criteria and then subjective force multipliers that can be assessed numerically  i.e. AOA  x force multiplier of publications  .x multiplier for abstracts x multiplier for actual papers etc. etc. etc.. Theres an algorithm that they have and each school is different with different math for some schools AOA is such a force multiplier that its a game changer. These people are then separated into buckets based on this composite score and analyzed sequentially as buckets. In each bucket there is a resorting stage and some of the candidates in bucket one are thrown in bucket two some are on the list and some are outright thrown out then the subjective part of the screen starts. Now the subjective evaluation within a bucket can look at your preclinical grades...but generally the whole point of a subjective review is to look at your NONnumerical attributes. The interviews are sent out based on that first screen. Then the process repeats with the remaining buckets. Sometimes they dont reach all the buckets. Sometimes theyll have to go through all the buckets.Bottom line get into the top bucket by maximizing your scores in other ways. I doubt your preclinical grades are going to influence your bucket that much because a huge number of schools do not send out preclinical grades. How can you subjectively compare places with clinical grades and those without? Basically through small force multipliers like deans list. You made a mistake but you have to make sure that the mistake doesnt pay the negative dividend in Step  because thats a really core element of the rank sorting process solely because of its numerical comparative value. If you dont know the material well enough for school youre not going to know enough for Step . So get studying now. ,medicalschool,cigf8i8,5,t5_2re2p

Same thing repeats attending gets pissed and takes the wire gets it in the right place. Fellow takes over. Now he is trying to place the stent and he is hitting the fluoro. Tries a few times to position but doesnt have the confidence to deploy. Attending very cranky now asks if he needs help... again. No hes fine. Goes for it again. Cant get position and pauses. But forgets his foot is still on the fluoro peddle. Attending yells Fluoro! Fellow is confused. Attending yells it again. Panic. Then the attending comes over and literally kicks the fellow in the leg to knock his foot off the fluoro peddle. Case ends and I still havent even introduced myself to the attending and have said no more than  words to the fellow. We stand and the attending starts to pimp the fellow mercilessly. Not for education just to bust him down. After  questions answered correctly he asks And what serum test could you run to check if you caused significant intravascular hemolysis from your poor technique? Fellow blanks. Zip. Its so thick in there you could cut the air with a knife. Attending keeps badgering fellow and then finally turns to me and says Well? What do you think med student?My mind has been racing furiously the whole time and I blurt out Lactate dehydrogenase? The attending smacks the fellow in the chest and says Even the fucking med student knew. And turns around and walk out.Hi Danny.

1706628,0,t3_2dsqq8,As many other people here have said  I highly recommend buying a couple pairs of scrubs. Its a small investment but seriously worth it. In my year people did a group order from online places and got it for super cheap. You dont want to wear normal cloths in the lab  much better to get scrubs solely for this. Also  definitely wash them separate from your other clothes! Youll thank me later. As for shoes  definitely dont wear anything open on top  such as crocs! Best bet is to wear an old comfy pair of sneakers or Adidas etc. Stuff drops and they WILL definitely get nasty. I had all sorts of nastiness get on my shoes.My school has lockers outside the labs so I left my nasty anatomy shoes in locker and put them on just for lab.Also if your school doesnt provide for you  consider getting a pair of cheap plastic safety goggles.

If I were you Id just suck it up and change your attitude so you can meet some of the reasonable people in your class or look outside medical school more than you already are. But part of the thing you need to realize is that you will forever have less and less time to do things outside of medicine from here until the end of residency. Its entirely up to you to be organized enough to MAKE time to actually be able to interact with people out in the real world outside the enclave of medicine.

2152112,0,t3_2jhfts,First of all try this I found it posted on a different forum its FREE because its still in Beta and I actually like it more than Firecracker or Memorang. Firecracker is alright... they dont have spaced repetition yet I guess so even if you rank your understanding of a topic  you dont see it again that day. LameMemorang is okay. The only thing is it doesnt have a lot of context on what you get wrong you just flip and the answer is a little blurb. With the site I posted above there is a pretty thorough explanation. Anki is kind of as good as you make it because you are making the flashcards. Its what I use and its such a pain but my grades have been so much better since Ive started doing it consistently. There are some premade decks search for Brosephalon on here for STEP . If you are pretty lazy if you pay for studyblue you can type the front of the flashcard term in one field and then it will show you what all the other users have put on the back side of their cards and you can just copy their card from them. Thats pretty cool. But its like  a month. Ive actually used all of the above except DIT. Picmonic is meeeh... Id say about  of each of their mnemonics stick with me sometimes is pretty helpful but doesnt explain anything is more about little gimmicks to help you remember. I totally thought the same thing as a first year I want to prepare for STEP already! But really trust everyone above you when they tell you to wait. Histology is the basis for pathology and until youve gone through and understand how its SUPPOSED to work you cannot possibly wrap your head about how it can go wrong. Anatomy is kinda important too. I think of it as learning a language. Your first year studying you focus on vocab words and little baby sentences. If you tried to read a giant text itd actually take longer and be less efficient. Focus on the material you are learning now and then if you really are feeling like it watch Pathoma L summer. And actually if you wanted to watch Pathoma during Phys it would probably be pretty helpful. But if you are just doing anatomy and histo now focus on that. And if you are just dead set on STEP  studying now you could buy UWORLD so expensive but if you are just rolliing in the dough and set it to just do anatomy questions would give you a sense of what board Qs are going to be like. But yeah most of the material you are learning is not going to be in first aid not because it isnt relevant but because its so simple compared to the rest of what you are supposed to know that first aid isnt going to state it outrightly necessarily. Or its just way too detailed and youll be able to forget it after that exam. ,medicalschool,clddrqc,1,t5_2re2p

Ultimately this girl wasnt interested enough in you for whatever reason to make it work with the time you have. My point being you dont need to spend days and days with someone. What were you doing when you hung out? You can do an awful lot in a day and youd budgeted a WHOLE weekend. Thats a lot of time more than a lot of people in relationships get to spend together. Medicine can make relationships difficult but for the most part the difficultly is in meeting people. If you have whole weekends to spend with someone then time isnt the biggest issue here. People with downvote but it might be worth evaluating why the relationship failed rather than just blaming medicine.Anyway sorry it didnt work out mate weve all been there and we all know how much it can suck. ,medicalschool,clknmcb,12,t5_2re2p

As more physicians transition to salary hospital positions and out of private practice and insurance companies continue to dictate more of care doctors are becoming work horses for the profession. I really agree with your last paragraph and personally I think we are going to see some other big changes in the next  years which include More automated management of patients with doctors having even less autonomy to manage patients Reduction of compensation across all specialties. Doctors may not have to work as hard as they once did hourwise but their earning potential will be capped. A further increase in midlevel providers with more responsibility NPs PAs that will assume the role doctors used to.  Medical school will go from  to  years.

3607941,0,t1_cq36tgd,I know you have been downvoted quite a bit so Im not entirely sure if anybody will read this but I respectfully disagree. While it is true there is a genetic factor in some cases of obesity see leptin mutations these cases are nowhere near as common as it is to find an obese person without a mutation. Being realistic we should say that obesity is multifactorial meaning one may have a predisposition to being obese but other factors are at play other than their genetics. Most of the cases of obesity are simply a calories incalories out situation and many people dont have the proper lifestyle to stay at a healthy weight. It is much easier and cheaper to eat food high in fats and avoid healthier foods like fresh produce. I know they taste a hell of a lot better and I would love to eat a McDouble every day until I die but I understand that is not a feasible lifestyle if I want to maintain a healthy weight. I think the real issue with your argument is that you make it seem as if obese people do not have control over their weight. This is entirely untrue. Just because some smokers may have a genetic disposition making them more prone to substance abuse does not mean that they will become a chronic smoker. It is their choice to smoke cigarettes just as it is an obese persons choice to eat high fat foods and not exercise an adequate amount. I just wish that people would approach this situation with a level head. Your doctor telling you to lose weight does not mean he is on a fat people crusade and fat shaming without understanding somebodys personal situation is just as ignorant. ,medicalschool,cq3j52b,12,t5_2re2p

A fair portion of the public just sees the hospital as this big black box where you go in stuff happens you come out better most of the time and theres a bill.THIS is a huge problem with healthcare and will continue until the public is better educated on the topic.,medicalschool,cqdpkyf,6,t5_2re2p

Does the school requiring the monitoring have required attendance for lectures? If they dont and depending on how often the testing is it should be fairly manageable. Make up for the extra time driving by finding some lectures to listen to. A lot of my classmates drove  mins to school during M and  and found this a good use of that time that feels wasted. How significant is the financial burden? Is it just the gas to get around or a fee for every test? ,medicalschool,cqhs209,3,t5_2re2p

I know that schools like to put a lot of pressure on everybody to start looking at specialties from such an early point but until youve had the opportunity to experience a particular field on your clinical rotations you will not have the insight you need to make an informed decision.Good Step scores and performance are necessary regardless of the specialty you apply for. As for knowing people main value there is obtaining strong letters of recommendation from people in the specialty you decide to pursue. Sometimes they may have connections that you can help you but it really depends on how strongly they value you as a medical student. My advice on research is to do it if theres a project that is meaningful to you.

4398464,0,t1_csleukq,This is an oversimplification of the ROTH IRA and isnt accurate.ROTHs allow  for tax free growth since you fund them with money youve already paid taxes on. With some exceptions you cant access that money until retirement age without paying a penalty. But the exceptions are educational expenses medical expenses and I believe buying your first home. All of which are likely relevant to OP.In general you want to contribute to a Roth of you expect your  tax bracket in retirement to be higher than it is now. Probably also the case for OP.The real question is if he should bother funding an IRA instead of just avoiding more loans. Thats a trickier one and I agree with you that this is probably the best argument against an IRA in his situation. ,medicalschool,cslfwl4,5,t5_2re2p

4524653,0,t1_ct0wghr,Currently it doesnt matter whether your DO or MD most people take both exams because . At a D.O. school you have to pass the comlex to continue rotations . Because taking both exams makes you eligible for both matches meaning more opportunities to match. What happens is since there is still a stigma DOs that want to do higher competitive specialties like ortho neurosurg etc etc go all in to the COMLEX and only participate in the D.O. match because thats their best shot. Because I think maybe one DO matched MD ortho last year. And the residency merger isnt a merger per say its more that all the residency programs MD and DO are governed by the same standards.My opinion is if you get into MD definitely go it will save you money and the hassle of two board exams. I am at a D.O. school right now and I dont really regret it Financially I regret it. ,medicalschool,ct0yz95,1,t5_2re2p

Heres what I like about it Its something you can try in real time with your own hands to make a patient feel better before they walk out of the office. I mean you can give the person a script for a muscle relaxer still but before they even leave and get that filled you can attempt something to ease their pain. Most of the techniques arent anything earth shattering it just comes down to putting your hands on a patient. Learning it has also helped me get better with differentials I think. Example chronic headache patient. I have the regular stuff on my DDX list but now Im also thinking it could be TMJ so Ill check that out and try to treat it if its there. Big exception Cranial.

Also some docs want to be dept heads or get into national societies that would require academic positions. Some also like research.  If u r really super excited abt ur specialty the best place to see the cutting edge front of it is at an academic center.  I also agree that a doctor should be properly compensated.  The problem is that the loans r not taken into salary compensation equation.  I think the general trend of primary care phy salary is on the rise and specialists will be taking a hit in the future including private practices.  If u r really worried abt money Id recommend getting out of medicine  or go into derm this is probably the only specialty that I see staying relatively the same in terms of pay.

And then more importantly you need to explain how you now have fixed that flaw. You got counseling and straitened out your life youre back living with family you got an ADHD diagnosis and are on medication now etc etc whatever. Schools need something they can hang their hat on when they go to bat for you. They need a reason as to why they should accept you after another school failed you.Trust me I had to do some remediations and the Deans office was not happy with me when I said I had no excuse to explain my previous bad grade.

6119133,0,t3_3zc62c,Ill let you in on a secret not everyone that goes into medicine every is super passionate about medicine.  Some people get into medicine and then figure out that they hate people and thats where some pathologists and radiologists come from.  Others become pathologists or radiologists because they find the field fascinating and can live without tons of patient contact.  To some people being a doctor is a job and they realize that they are best suited for doing that job and look for meaning in their life elsewhere. It goes against the ethos of Medicine as a calling but it would be dishonest to deny that their is not an economic force driving people to become doctors. Third year might actually help you feel more engaged with actual patient contact so hold on.  As other people have said honestly consider your options.  You might be more unhappy trying to make it in a different field than in medicine or you might be much happier.  But unless there was something that you really wanted to do but gave up on to pursue medicine there might not be greener pastures elsewhere.  ,medicalschool,cyl6kct,9,t5_2re2p

6197315,0,t1_cyu0ke3,ChrisIm pretty excited to respond to this question because its pretty much what Ive studying throughout my current MPH year th year US Allo MDMPH. So where to begin If someone were to refer to the increased use of NPPAs as The sky is falling! I would respondGood sir the sky has already fallen and the sun is still shining. Why? NPsPAs are already shockingly abundant. Further their output will exceed demand probably around...right now...within the next couple of years.  Lets consider the numbers NPs  PAs   NPs Annually  new NPs graduate. In  years they doubled their numbers. How staggering is that? Imagine if in  years we doubled the number of practicing physicians in the US? Thats crazy!  Employment Change demand  Why is this important? Well it means they may have already over supplied the system. Hence why were plugging them into every healthcare spot possible that requires Midlevel skills. Urban noncomplex primary care urgent care preop followups etc. Source PAs  increase of roughly   Employment demand My interpretation PA schools are a bit smarter than NP schools. They are matching supply to demand somewhat.SourcesPhysicians Roughly between  active.    active Employment change Interpretation Were slightly up US Allopathic Medical schools have increased enrollment by  since . We wont match the number of resident spots for..I think  years. I need to look into this more though currently we have a residency surplus of roughly . The demand for physicians remains shockingly high despite the market being flooded with NPPAs. SourcesSummary My Opinion. Weve already seen the tidal wave of NPPAs entering the market. NPs will likely oversupply their system. They are currently and successfully lobbying for equal practice privileges and reimbursement on a statebystate basis. I am honestly incredibly impressed by this. Somewhere in the US there is a massive war chest of funding on behalf of NPs with extremely focused quiet and rapid lobbying. By the time state physician organizations respond to the legislative process theyve already been defeated. Im pretty convinced this is currently being funded by the healthcare industry specifically hospitals. Its being supported by particularly rabid nursing unions and organizations. . Someone somewhere is carefully watching the supplydemand of PAs and modeling education after the allopathic model. Limit production to increase demand. The result? Anecdotally I would say PAs are respected more by MDDOs in the healthcare setting and have carefully aligned themselves with MDDO organizations to expand scope of practice without demanding independent practice. . Physicians..oh where to begin...demand is insanely high and not projected to decrease even with NPPAs. In specific fields such as anesthesiology CRNAs have certainly encroached however not likely surpassed physicians. They are taking contracts in primarily outpatientstandalone surgery settings. Primary care pay? Its gone up over the past  years.Specialist paystill increasing! Some subspecialists have seen decreases in feeforservice and have responded by doing more procedures. Overall physician compensation continues to climb. . Whats going to happen Hospitals will continue to consolidate aggressively. They will use NPPAs because they are cheap admit more order more labsimaging which makes bank for hospitals. Over the next  years insurancegovernment is going to curb this. This along with over supply will decrease incentive for hospitals to employ them. Research will show poorer outcomes among NPPAs for independent management of patients. Creation of tieredhealthcare will arise. The poor will be more likely to see NPPAs wellinsured see physicians. NPPAs will likely be the gatekeeper for every specialty from FM to surgery.. Healthcare of the United States will increase regardless of provider level of training. People gaining access to the healthcare system who havent before will get decent care regardless of provider. Think about...asthma diabetes smoking mental illness etc. A lot of these conditions dont demand an MDDO level of training. . We will see the rise of the almighty CaseManager hopefully a trained social care worker. Seriously these guys will be responsible for organizing care making contact with superhyperextremeutilizers.  of patients make up roughly  of the healthcare costs. the  most expensive health conditions account for  percent of total health care expenses.Patients with multiple chronic conditions cost up to seven times as much as patients with only one chronic condition.Lets think about this If we want to actually cut healthcare costs we really only need to focus on that pesky ! Whos the best prepared for this type of complex coordination phonecalling pushpulling gritty paperwork? Social Workers. They are insanely cheap to employ. Id bet my tuition interest that they will be next prominent force in healthcare. Taking a look at the BLS on it..in  there will be an increase employment of ! Almost as much as physicians compared to NPPAs.I hope to go into Emergency Medicine next year. Ill be hoping that in the future to increase ER social worker number on an experimentalresearch level thinking  ratio with ER docs they see every patient the physician does. So why did I type this all out? Well one Im in between MPH semesters. Two Im going to revise this and probably use it as a paper outline. Thank you. Youll probably be the only one to read this.

It will be another year and a half before you make ANY money in medicine and at least . before you hit that  figure level. Thats a long time during which you could be saving up for retirement or your kids college.People always say that the MD degree is worth getting but for you it comes at a cost of a years salary plus whatever youd pay for fourth year and it probably isnt really worth much unless you get an intern year under your belt and get the unrestricted license so thats another year of salary squandered.On the other hand there was a reason you went to med school. Is that reason still relevant? You said medicine would just be a job so it sounds like it might not be.Have you already paid for the second half of third year or gotten your scholarship or whatever? If so it might be worth seeing the rest of the specialties and seeing if something can rekindle whatever interested you in medicine in the first place. If you get to the end of the year and nothing seems to fit then that might be your signal that its time to get out of this.If I were you and leaning towards getting out of medicine I would get out at the end of third year. The three years youve spent are a sunk cost and luckily they havent left you saddled with any debt. On the other hand if I were you and leaning towards sticking it out I would understand that Im committing to at least  more years in medicine in the hopes that getting a full license will translate into work that is worth two years lost salary plus interest on savings from that salary.Up to you in the end though obviously.,medicalschool,czdbb4j,-1,t5_2re2p

The acceptance of women into traditionally male vocations is still relatively recent so  any associated issues are only beginning to appear as of late. Remember the recent news story about the FDNY trainee who failed the physical exam so many times that she was given a free pass and the standards were subsequently lowered? This person obviously wasnt cut out for firefighting but just might be the one called to your house fire someday. Heres another And another Dr. Karen Sibert put it bestStudents who aspire to go to medical school should think about the consequences if they decide to work parttime or leave clinical medicine. Its fair to ask them  women especially  to consider the conflicting demands that medicine and parenthood make before they accept and deny to others soughtafter positions in medical school and residency. They must understand that medical education is a privilege not an entitlement and it confers a real moral obligation to serve. Patients need doctors to take care of them.

It seems to be a rather large endeavor that would need substantial outside investment and I believe Tony Hsieh provided this initially? So my main question is has Turntable been able to turn a profit without additional outside investment? I know its been an extraordinarily short amount of time to really determine if this could be financially sustainable but I am always wondering if this type of model would be possible without the initial largescale investor. I know smaller direct pay models can do quite well however do not offer the types of benefits and classes you offer your members. Additionally in a previous article in the Atlantic about this you said Turntable Health has the capacity to care to  patients.

6548891,0,t1_czwj7ee,This is a little short sighted I think.You can try out various methods of learning but at a certain point you learn that something doesnt work for you. Just because you not literally YOU dont like TBL doesnt mean youve never tried to appreciate why someone would think its advantageous. I happen to be one of those people who find studying for a test much more time efficient when doing so alone and Ive been in various environments where Ive tried all sides. I have much more fun in TBL tbh but when it comes down to crunch time I feel I have to put it to the wayside for a bit. An orthopod or radiologist isnt going to go to his colleague with every case and say brainstorm this with me. Perhaps hospitalists work better this way perhaps they dont.

Mucus also makes it easy to dislodge bacteria that do not have good adherence virulent factors.Say you get a viral infection that causes a cold.  The virus will infect cells and replicate the body will form an immune response to these virons.  Ca Ca especially will cause mast cell degranulation leading to Eosinophil chemotaxis. Eosinophils come in and do their thing. A biproduct of this is massive mucus production.  Whether it helps the body or not depends on the infection.  In a cold it could be debatable as in it might just be an overactive response.  Many times the body overreacts when it shouldnt since the immune system isnt perfect.  So to answer your question in relation to a cold it could help eliminate virons that exit the into nasopharyngeal area hypothetical or prevent more viruses from entering via a barrier.

Youll get questions like this in residency interviews but they are much saner and more grounded in reality. My answer? In disaster triage you save who can be saved most immediately. First priority is gonna be the kid in anaphylaxis. Thats a problem which can be easily and quickly resolved. You may choose to lay eyes on the kid in cardiac arrest looking for an easy H or T but Id say you make that number two because kids dont often suffer cardiac arrest for the same reasons adults do. Its almost always secondary to some other cause usually respiratory arrest. So that kid might be too far gone. The stroke can wait for last.

A classmate of mine was accepted into an eight year program in high school and got the required MCAT and GPA at the end of four years. However he was still required to go through the interview process like everyone else at the medical school. The admissions committee felt his interview wasnt professional enough and simply rejected him. Many classmates in the same program ended up applying to other programs just to test the waters so they still loaded up their CVs in those four years. The combined programs are nice but if you are going to put in the work to have a strong CV and get a  you are probably going to get into that medical program anyways and might as well go to an undergrad where you will enjoy your four years better,medicalschool,d26ud14,14,t5_2re2p

Unless youre going into radiology and need a faculty letter how you do in this elective wont makebreak anything. Try to ask relevant questions and show some baseline level of enthusiasm. Even if you hate radiology youll see pathology thats related to almost any field you may be interested in. There are several ways to make a bad impression. Dont ask questions and interrupt in the middle of their dictations. You can ask beforeafter or at natural pauses. You would think this goes without saying but youd be surprised.  Dont fall asleep. This can be hard because the room is dark and youre not actively doing much.  Go to the conferences if its expected. Go home if youre toldallowed to go home. Radiology residents are chill and at least at my school will often try to help you out with long lunch breaks or just sending you home early.

7396669,0,t3_4glngz,MS here from a US MD school. Ill give you a brief rundown of what happened to me after I took Step  and hopefully it will make you feel a little better. I took Step  practice before my dedicated study period and I got like a  or something like that. I dont really remember but it was super low. I like you also freaked out. I studied for  weeks and got a . I was a little disappointed at first but glad to have passed Step . There were DEFINITELY things I could have done better to prepare I didnt finish Uworld and had some sections of First Aid I could have read more. Then I went right into third year. I thought being on the wards was way better than the classroom. Then took Step  and got a . I wanted to do Emergency Medicine but I knew I wasnt the strongest applicant so I applied broadly  programs. I got about  interviews went on  and matched to my number . I got great reviews while on my Emergency Medicine rotations. One doc wrote in my after shift eval This student is the best to rotate through the ED this year. I know Im not the smartest person in my class. In fact my school objectively places me in the lower  of my peers based on my grades. However I work hard when Im on shift. Im always reading about my patients and anything else I think is important to know while on shift. I get along great with the nurses and I am fun to work with in the department. Patients nurses and doctors dont care about what your step score is on the floor. If you are willing to work hard get along with others and have a reasonable level of intelligence you can get along just fine. Step  is by far the worst part of this whole process. It sucks studying for the test. It sucks being around people who are studying for the test. It sucks actually taking the test. Youll do fine though. Your scores will shoot up once you actually start studying and doing practice questions. I would anticipate you getting a good score if you do everything you are supposed to. You will probably have A LOT of options as an MD looking to go into primary care. Good Luck!!,medicalschool,d2iyb75,26,t5_2re2p

7433389,0,t3_4h36op,That depends on the subject youre tutoring in. In some things youve learned a lot more than the nurse needs to know and the focus is different.For instance BSNlevel pathophysiology is a onesemester course. Imagine cramming everything that can go wrong with all body systems into four credits. Pharmacology is also just one semester and we  dont take organic chem as a foundation. We learn what the drugs do but a lot less about how they do it.IMO the med student would be a great source of information especially explanations of why does this make sense as long as the tutoring is led by the nursing student asking questions. If they try to go about having the M teach what he knows hes liable to give way too much detail about the wrong things and not enough time covering the stuff the SN will be tested on.,medicalschool,d2n4ns1,4,t5_2re2p
7435262,0,t1_d2najzh,gtRegarding the SBIRT research survey its all well and good that the block director waived the unethical requirement fur you but unless they actively reached out to every student and told them that the survey was not required and apologized for trying to require it this is still a massive fail on their part.No apology but there was an announcement that it was no longer mandatory.gtNothing that a tenured faculty member does to a student possibly short of sexual assault can be unprofessional. Students of course can easily be unprofessional. You might say this is ridiculous and unfair and youd be right but those are the facts on the ground.Well yes and no. I actually went back and looked at the email chain I actually have some hope for admin now.The background Neuro block we had an interprofessional thing with the audiology amp PT students on vestibular and balance disorders. There was an pre amp post test which were not mandatory. Naturally the completion rates were not . This pissed the professor off she is the head of the med school interprof Ed dept and she sent an email with specific info removed changes in ltgt Ill refer to her as UnproessionalProff or UpP.gtTo allI have recently being assessing the prepost tests from the lteventgt and I am finding that many medical students Pre and or post tests were not handed in!  As you might imagine I am very disappointed by the lack of professionalism and integrity exhibited by this cohort of students.gtTherefore at todays mandatory event signin sheets will be passed around at the start of ltMDsgt lecture.  At the end of ltPhDsgt lecture you will receive a very brief paper evaluation of the SBIRT module .  This eval will remain anonymous and you will hand it in to a faculty office of curriculum admin upon exiting ltroomgt.  At this time you will also initial next to your name on a sign out sheet.  We will have tables just outside the two exit doors of ltroomgt so facilitate this process but given there are approximately  students in the  class this will not be a quick process.gtI apologize to the class and those students that are being inconvenienced for the actions of their peers.Not too bad but not great either. Essentially rpettyrevenge material. Two minutes after she sent that email a student repliedgtltUnproessionalProfgtThanks for the email. Could you please clarify for me the exact times of the mandatory sessions today. There is much debate among my classmates about this.ThanksltStudentgtThe reason for the confusion The listed mandatory events had a session that day from  but her earlier email had listed  and nobody could get a straight answer about what was actually mandatory. Two minutes after that email so  mins total since the first email went out we get the following.gtI sent an email out last Friday are the students in your class unable to read! Sorry but I am not very happy with the  class right now!gtpmgtA very unhappy ltUnproessionalProfgtSo then another student emails her points out that we have multiple calendar entries and emails from the block director saying  is the only mandatory session amp also calls her outgtI just dont know if this was the appropriate way to handle the situation. It seems more antagonizing than helpful and speaking to a lack of professionalism with regards to some of the language. I just wanted to make you aware of how this was perceived instead of having a bunch of students saying stuff rudely to you.UpP then tries to backpedal starting off with an apology for being unprofessional that she deserved to be called on it but she was frustrated. Then she goes right back to it claiming we were told during a recorded lecture that both events were mandatory which isnt something that can happen  lectures dont constitute official communication and nothing said in lecture is binding and then tried to blame the block director for covering this properly during orientation. On the bright side she did end with another apologygtYou can be angry at me for my juvenile comment..I realize it was very immature on my part.never said I was perfect.  Once again I apologize for my unprofessional behavior.Another student emails her after this saying that gtI am sorry that you are frustrated with the  class. I understand how frustrating it can be to work with students that you feel arent giving respect to the events that the faculty takes a lot of time to prepare for us. However I am equally upset with the emails that I have received from you today. The reason that people are confused about the exact times for the mandatory events are  The email has been messing up and a lot of us havent been receiving all the emails or the emails have been extremely delayed  I still cant even log into outlook on the computer since updating my password fortunately I was one of the ones that received your email on my phone  ltblock directorgt sent out a list of mandatory events awhile back and stated that the mandatory time slot is from  pm  The schedule on ltweb portalgt also states that the mandatory time slot is from pm. We have spent a lot of time this block trying to figure out what is expected of us through confusing emails and a lack of updating on ltweb portalgt I also think that it is disrespectful to call out an individual student from our class for trying to respectfully clarify the time. I also do not know how it can be considered a lack of integrity for not filling out a survey that we were told was optional.  I normally wouldnt get involved but I felt the need to say something so maybe you could understand where a lot of us are coming from. Finally UpP ends the chain she apologizes again then basically calls scummyscammers for not doing voluntary surveys. Two days later we get an email from the block director apologizing for the confusion and stating that even though the  pm lecture was still considered mandatory even though it actually wasnt... that students who didnt attend wouldnt be penalized. They followed through with that too because I wasnt there and never heard a word about it after the email shitstorm.The final fallout was UpP being called in front of a committee made up of students amp student affairs staff. I can only hope she got a letter in her file.ampnbspTlDR  Unprofessional Prof UpP is salty that students didnt do voluntary surveys sends out class wide email impugning our integrity and with petty revenge  we have to sign in and out of a mandatory session one at a time slowly amp painfully. Student emails asking her to clarify times. UpP replyalls asking if our class is capable of reading. Several students email her back calling her on her shitty behavior pointing out that she was wrong about the times and that communication about expectations was either confusing or nonexistant. UpP pulls a sorrynotsorry apologizing but blaming others and repeating that students have done scummy things and thats why she was frustrated. Block director emails us two days later says attendance will be disregarded. UpP is called before committee of studentsstudent affairs we dont really kow what happened in that meeting.,medicalschool,d2ncbaf,5,t5_2re2p

7871165,0,t3_4n4ce9,Took the test yesterday it was nice to wake up and not have to study for once. I walked out of the test knowing that I wouldnt change my studying methods even if I could go back the things that were difficult were either EXTREMELY vague or I had no idea what the question was actually asking me. That being said I felt pretty decent motoring through the test probably averaging  marked for the first  blocks save for block three where I ended up marking more. Then the last two blocks hit and I either hit a wall or the questions hit my weak points ended up between  I wasnt  sure on I mark ones that Im not  on including guesses and things where I may be  on. I think my exam had random blocks of  strewn about I know I had a few right in the middle of my exam. What really frustrated me about the test was something that everyone else has echoed coming out some questions are just so vague where youre like I really dont know if the lack of a fever makes me rule this out or not but the other answers dont make sense either or you get it down to a  gut call. There were only a HANDFUL of questions maybe like  where I had no idea what they were even getting at usually involving a picture or echo or whatnot which was less than I was expecting honestly. On the whole I would say it felt similar to uworld just a lot more vague and random at points. I thought it was honestly less difficult than step  in terms of breadth of knowledge but the dumb vagueness that kept popping up was frustrating.Im hopeful that I got a good score...but realistically its going to come down to how well I guessed which is unfortunate. I could see myself getting a pretty wide range from s the latter only if Im extremely lucky not feeling great right now.

Youre comparing a physician salary post taxation to an engineer salarymid to late career since most engineers are older and about to retire pretaxation. When I did the math with my family before about this if a physician works less than  years she or he will end up making less in the long term. If he or she works  years then it would be the reverse. The whole point is that physicians make solid money to recoup what they have invested. In the end its probably a wash and it should be said that one should never go into medicine to make money.,medicalschool,d41fq7r,1,t5_2re2p

8022535,0,t1_d4hmu4j,You know how Jesus said The Meek shall inherit the Earth? He almost got it right but he was unfortunately a carpenter from a time long before computing existed. What he meant to say was that The Meek shall inherit the Internet. This whole Internet thing was supposed to advance the human race and be an Information SuperHighway. People from far distant corners of the Earth collaborating and developing ideas and advancements. Equalize humanity by destroying geographic boundaries etc etc. There was a point where it once did that but all of that is buried deep under layers upon layers of nonsense. Youd have to stumble on old basic HTML websites built on Geocities to find what the Internet was supposed to be. Now the Internet serves as a platform to bring crazy oversensitive people that should have never had a voice together. There is power in numbers and just the very thought that there are others out there that listen to all the crazy and appreciate it whips these people into a frenzy. There used to be a time when we respected and emulated people who were stoic and reserved. Now were in a world where any emotion that you feel must be publicly displayed discussed and given the utmost importance. An important part of our training is learning to be calm rational and objective. Patients are unwell in distress and sometimes dying. Our job is to help them in the best way possible medically while also being someone they can lean on during the hysteria and trust. Any idiot can learn that Copper is a required ion for collagen synthesis or that hexokinase has a higher VMax than Fructokinase. Or you can just look those facts up on your phone now. Were supposed to be something more. Its a little difficult to inspire confidence in someone thats desperately afraid that they might actually die when youre caught up in your own special pity party of how nothing is the perfect state that youre entitled to no?A lot of us have some pretty insane debt. Fancy undergrad universities and brand name degrees really add up. Theres nothing cheap about Med School either. I havent even graduated med school yet and my loans add up to more than what my parents paid for our first house in the late s. Its not the greatest feeling in the world to know that when you really start your life you have a giant negative balance. BUT its not that significant an issue as people make it out to be here. Theres literally two options here  You create a sound financial plan to get rid of that debt taking advantage of the enormous tax breaks it gives you. You live in a reasonably frugal manner for a couple of years and be done with it.  Or you sit around and whine about malpractice insurance rates Obama care falling median salaries etc. You do nothing to ensure your financial wellbeing because youre too busy complaining about how its someone elses fault that this happened to you and commiserate with other people on the Internet and watch your life fall apart. Very few situations in life are permanent and immutable. Theres always a solution if youre willing to look for it and work for it. In the immortal words of Scrooge McDuck Work smarter not harder! As for the depression anxiety sadness and general aura of regret thats just noise. Unfortunately its currently fashionable to pretend to empathize with the noise. Ill add this up as advice for the new medical students  Medical School and the path to becoming a Doctor is difficult. It will throw you down kick you and walk away only to walk back and kick you some more. Struggling and failing absolutely does not mean that you are incapable or too weak or too stupid. Everyone struggles and everyone fails.  WHEN YOU FALL ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET BACK UP AND UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAPPENED AND WORK HARDER TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESNT HAPPEN AGAIN. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD YOU IMMEDIATELY MAKE A POST ABOUT IT ON THIS SUBREDDIT SO THAT STRANGERS ON THE INTERNET CAN MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER BY TALKING ABOUT HOW UNFAIR LIFE IS.Life is unfair. Most things that are worth achieving are difficult. Deal with it move on. There are people that are significantly smarter than you. There are also people that are much more clever than you are. Nothing guarantees you equality and complaining on the Internet most definitely does not grant it to you. ,medicalschool,d4ht3o9,86,t5_2re2p

For subjects I was weak in I looked back to first aid.I definitely found many of the NBME questions to be worded vaguely.  They know we all read FA so they word things differently.  A few questions were outright poorly written.  One thing I realized with the NBMEs is that if it sounds right it probably is right they really dont try to trick you for the majority of questions and if youve never heard of a diseasegeneenzymeetc it probably doesnt exist or isnt the right answer.  Only a couple times did I correctly choose an answer Ive never heard of after fully eliminating all other answer choices.  Another strategy is for questions that you have to guess on go ahead and eliminate answer choices you know as wrong.  Think about each answer and why it cant be the answer to the question.  If you can narrow guesses down to  answer choices instead of  choices a  can turn into  which can be the difference between a  and .

When I left the test center I seriously felt like there was a good chance that I would be in the low s. Very happily surprised today and still not sure how it happened but Im definitely not going to question it lol.Step  Uworld st pass  done throughout rd year rotationsUworld nd pass UWSA  weeks out NBME    week out rushed through itNBME   days outNBME    days outActual step  score If you go back and read my old post the day after my exam I was freaking out. I felt like I guessed on most of the exam and I marked gt questions each block. I didnt run out of time on any section but I didnt have time to review all my marked questions so I would just skim most of them real quick before the block ended. As you can see my actual score was higher than all my practice assessments so luck must have really been on my side that day. Also my score report shows that while most of my categories were in the higher performance side none of them had stars most dont even reach the end of the page.Im super happy with my score. Hopefully if anyone else is freaking out as bad as I was this will provide some encouragement.By the way my study materials were MTB for step  the entire book except the IM part and MTB for step  for IM and Uworld. I didnt use uptodate except for when i needed it in my rotations and I dont suggest using it as a resource at all except to help u during rotations.Also I made anki cards for the material I studied from MTB and Uworld its on reddit somewhere under the same username if u look it up and want to use it.Cheers,medicalschool,d5b8eva,7,t5_2re2p

I had no expectation coming into this whole experience but being someone who struggled to get into a DO school and narrowly dodged the Caribbean I have been pretty anxious about this exam since the day I got into medical school impostor syndrome hits me hard.I think the biggest thing that helped me was using pathoma and FA almost exclusively to study for nd year modules. I became very familiar with the books and was able to watch my schools lectures at x speed one time and then stick to FA to get me a decent score. Also my friends refer to me as a firecracker salesman so that basically explains my love for that as a study resource throughout st and nd year.,medicalschool,d5bbpww,2,t5_2re2p

Its so the IT department can have consistency when they help us. You can have another laptop to study with but often the school either requires that you bring the mandatory laptop or they say that they are not liable for anything if your unsanctioned laptop stops working during an exam. This means you cant count on IT to save you. MacBook Pros are great for their simple barebasics user interface and physical hardiness.

8367403,0,t1_d5neb07,Well here in Canada as you know the economy is relatively flat. The BOC has maintained rates for ever some banks are offering negative rate mortgages. Oil is in a bit of slump which is our life line. We continue to bleed full time jobs and household debt independent of the good student loanmortgage debt is steadily increasing. Housing markets are either poor or stagnant across the country. The two major exceptions are Vancouver and Toronto. These housing markets are out of this world with year to year increases beyond . Last year collectively in Vancouver people who owned homes made more money by sitting on their home value than they did through work. The BC economy is housing and Vancouver is now a resort city with no real contribution to the world other than to offload money. And our housing markets are founded exclusively on foreign cash. Condo developments are being marketed to Asian markets directly before they are marketed in Canada. Furthermore no one lives in these condos because they are seen as an investment there is no foreign occupancy tax on these investments unlike other cities in the world which has resulted in bidding wars between those seeking rent or leaving the big city for good. Also the big houses that are being bought are being flipped often multiple times by our own real estate agents. The funny thing is that these  million houses are owned by lt year olds such that loopholes can be used to shelter tax from the homes real owners. How does this affect my family right now? It doesnt. Sure we live in a  sqft condo instead of a multi bed house but my wife and I can walk everywhere and we are happy. Neither of us wanted that anyway because any extra time we have we want to spend as a family no doing house chores. We are frugal but live comfortably.How does it affect us later on? If we have kids we will have to move. Who knows what the housing situation will be like in the future. Invariably though you can be as fiscally responsible as unrepenting scrooge but other people will always fuck it up for you. Interest rates will increase eventually Asian money will stop flooding the market place once loopholes are closed the Quebec investor immigration plan is shut down emptyforeign homes will be taxed and China et al will crack down on both dirty money and money in general that is leaving their continent. There is also only so much space to build condos and given the number of millennials that are leaving the big cities something will be done soon or else we will be in trouble especially as foreign investors have minimal commitment to live in Canada in the long run. They usually first come here to give birth so that their children can get citizenship or send their foreignborn children here for school and subsequent citizenship. That way the whole family can be sponsored so they can get access to healthcare. Once they have their citizenship they leave. I really hope there is not a crash that would be hard on all of us. Instead I hope the mucky mucks around us can rub enough brain cells together to control the slowing in a fashion that makes housing both affordable again and doesnt hurt my portfolio. I would also like to see a program instituted that encourages new citizens of Canada to stay in Canada and not just come for the health care on occasion. By the way I am far too lazytired to provide sources for all of this either take my word or if you search for these things you will readily come across them. Let me know if you have any questions. ,medicalschool,d5nh5kx,1,t5_2re2p

8614626,0,t1_d6i6b8p,You are experiencing a common rd year conundrum. There is no allencompassing resources out there. You cant go wrong just focusing on uworld.Step up to medicine  very thorough resident level reading covering IM but no peds OBGYN surgery psych Step up to step   covers all subjects but more watered down. Doesnt focus too well on next steppatient management type questions. MTB  very heavy focus on next steppt mgmt but omits important diseases randomly here and there. Not a bad supplemental read because the wording is very conversational and straightforward but honestly I think its confusing and often contradictory. Other people love it and swear by it. FA step   didnt use it cant really comment. Uworld  probably has just about all the information you need to know and for me was the most effective way to learn.So as you can see no one resource has it all. It sucks. Step two is a frustrating exam to prepare for but most people would agree that its actually easier than step one. Step two begins to incorporate the art of clinical medicine into standardized exams which kind of mucks things up compared to the cleaner feel of step one.

We both had to accept that our status quo wasnt feasible any longer. Ultimately we set new priorities. The house isnt all that neat these days but he doesnt let it bother him and he picks up what slack he can within reason. When I have time off it doesnt necessarily get any cleaner either because I choose to spend that time cuddling with my husband! We also made a point of scheduling a date night once every two weeks or so. It gives him an opportunity to have time with that gal he married in the first place lets me turn off my med student neuroses and gives us a chance to connect.

8683338,0,t1_d6qjlct,This TEE vs. CT angio is a wonderful example of what I discussed in my earlier response.  The correct i.e. textbook answer is not necessarily the best one for the patient.  Yes many references will claim that a TEE is the appropriate test to order here but  times in real world scenarios the CTA is what is ordered.  And its not because of invasiveness or interobserver agreement  its purely a matter of speedefficiency.  It is almost always faster and easier to order a CTA for a patient with suspected dissection than a TEE since the former requires a  second call to a radiologist while the later requires  minutes of inperson time by a cardiologist who may not even be on site.  A person claiming that a bedside TEE is fast has probably never been in the position to request andor perform one.   Bottom line for a test TEE is a fine answer and maybe even the preferred answer but in reallife CTA is what almost everyone does.,medicalschool,d6r1jnk,0,t5_2re2p

8686566,0,t1_d6rexuj,Well I think its amazing haha. It really is a truly fascinating specialty. I mean even to this day I think patient contact is a bit overrated but that may just be me. If you went into medicine for the science and diagnosis radiology should be at the top of your list easily. We are always top of the tech and always innovating. The word old doesnt even exist in our vocabulary. Me and my colleague were discussing it the other day actually. We happen to think it stems from exposure to radiology in medical school. A lot of attendingsnonrads pretend they can do what radiologist do. And a lot of radiology attendings are shit teachers to medical students to be honest. And I completely understand why. Radiology is a very large dependency on a through understanding of anatomy embryology and pathophysiologypathogenesis. Something Ive noticed many medical students seem to not really understand as much as they claim. Which is not their fault. This stuff takes years to master. I thought I understood it in medical school too. Boy was I wrong lol. There is something very beautiful when you can locate all the markers of an organ understand why it is shaped like it is understand how the disease occurs and literally see it occurring over time. My favorite casesfrom an academic standpoint are long term cancer cases like stage stage . I know it is horrible for the patient and I feel terribly for them. However it is just so fascinating to see how their anatomy changes over the months and years there is nothing quite like it. I think because in DR  of the work is in your head most medical students arent getting exposure. A mistake medical students often make is they try to memorize diagnoses in radiology. There is a very strict difference between effective and standard memorization. If you are not practicing effective memorization then you are doing it wrong. Its basically like watching a professor do a calculus problem. It looks ok doesnt look too hard looks boring obviously.  But when you actually do it you are just sitting there uh duhhhh for like  hours trying to figure out this one problem and when you finally figure it out. You realize it was actually kind of fun doing it despite having some frustration lol. So when theymedical students go to a radiology rotation and sit behind a radiologist and watch him dictate it seems boring. It is like watching someone play super smash bros brawl. Once in awhile youll see a really cool move but most of the time it looks boring. But when you play it is really fun right?this is probably a better analogy then my math one lolMy point is a medical student has little to no place in the radiology department because there are no physical exam skills to test there are no unofficial reads since the preliminary reads are done by residents. So the best I can do for medical students is hand them a textbook and let them ask me questions oftenat least in diagnostic and explain what I am doing when I have the time.  And I think it sucks because it really is not representative of what being a radiologist is like. Most medical students cant even begin to understand how great it is when a clinician comes to consult you down in the reading room. It really makes you feel worth it and appreciated. Radiology is kind of like an outlier. It is a great fun specialty not a ton of patient contactsome with procedures but very intellectually stimulating. It is definitely not for everyone. I have a  page essay I wrote on why I went into radiology and why I am still in it for the long haul I hand it to every single medical student that joins me on my subI. My friend in neurorads wrote one as well. Every year I get at least  kids in the class who promise theyll think about in the end about  apply and ask me for a rec. Which is pretty good in my opinion lol. I think we radiologists need to do our best to share our experiences because that is how we introduce our specialty to the next generation. A rotation in radiology is utterly worthless in learning what radiology is like at all. I really hate it because I feel like medical students are missing out on a fantastic specialty that they simply dont understand. I wish I could put them in my shoes for one day just so they can have a day in the life not a day of observing. ,medicalschool,d6rg4ma,44,t5_2re2p

8785562,0,t1_d73l43q,Its more than that. Reimbursement for Medicare is set from the top down in the U.S. by a committee that effectively determines how much Medicare will reimburse per CPT code. Pretty much every insurance company uses those CPT codes and then many base what they will pay out based on the Medicare rates i.e. Aetna may pay out  of Medicare Blue Cross pays out  etc.. Somewhere along the way that committee decided that a  essentially a high complexity primary care visit that can take  minutes of work was worth about the same as a  excise  cm benign skin lesion and we got to where we are today. Dermatologists are paid more by their employers because they bill out for more valuable codes. But the codes are only more valuable because the insurance companies and the government in all their infinite wisdom have decided that spending a few minutes excising a benign lesion is just as valuable as spending an hour on a really complicated patient in the clinic. If people were actually serious about primary care being important we would change how doctors are reimbursed.  Instead we have all these ACOMIPSMACRA quality pay schemes that promise primary care doctors an extra  if they complete a mountain of paperwork and start basing their treatment decisions on what Uncle Sam thinks is best. And they wonder why people dont want to go into primary care.,medicalschool,d73v9h0,9,t5_2re2p

8957360,0,t1_d7oa1ou,Because its a different specialty? Im gonna copy and paste a previous comment since this is such a common question.gt Family medicine is a three year residency program after which you are boardcertified in Family Medicine. ACGME requirements for a Family Med program include  months of pediatrics  months of maternity care  month of gynecology and  months general surgery among other things. Many family programs go beyond these requirements but not all. Family Med docs can do inpatient outpatient emergency room primary care etc. There is almost no limit to how they can practice but fellowship options are very limited at least compared to other specialties.gt Med Peds is a four year residency program after which you are boardcertified in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics. These are the same boards that categorical IM and Peds residents take. You are fully qualified in both specialties. Compared to the Family requirements listed above Med Peds ACGME requirements include  months maternity  months general surgery and  months of pediatrics rotations. After completing residency Med Peds docs can do primary care become a hospitalist or choose to do any IM or Peds fellowship or even a combined fellowship that would leave them quadrupleboarded.gt Overall Med Peds cuts out the OBGYN and surgery parts of being a Family doc and beefs up the Peds side to create a much more balanced experience. Med Peds docs tend to have more depth to their training because they have a narrower focus. After residency you have significantly more fellowship options as a Med Peds grad than as a Family doc.,medicalschool,d7ojgxj,5,t5_2re2p

For you youre basically making the decision about your rank list based on your impression of the program in  days the more exposure you have in formal and casual settings the more you can trust your impression. The program wants to know that they can stand you for  years depending on your specialty and resident input is one of the things they can use. The relative weight programs put on the dinner is more likely to be program dependent and not specialty dependent. As far as bringing an SO meh. You can if theyre explicitly invited just use your judgement. And finally while the dinners are nice for the reasons Ive said above theyre not make or break. Everyone knows interview season and traveling is rough and youre going to miss a few. Accept it and make it to what you can.

9103835,0,t3_54yx41,The most frequent complaint I hear is that it is very hard to collaborate on making an anki deck AND it is even harder to receive updates from a master deck into your personal deck. This means that there is lots of doubling up of work. The most logical use of anki is for a few or many people in a med school class to collaborate and turn large highyield resources First Aid Pathoma etc. into an anki deck or to turn class lectures into an anki deck and then share them with the class. The way anki is built makes this very difficult.  Problems arise when importing new decks . The way anki interprets the relative newness of cards is problematic. So if I have a version of a card and I download the masterdeck with an updated version of this card it is very unpredictable how anki will handle that. . The way anki treats card types is very clunky. Often there is duplication of cards or failure to load cards into the correct decks because anki cant tell that two cards master deck and personal deck are different interationsversions of the same card. . It is nearly impossible for users to make small additions or improvements to their personal decks and then upload those improvements to the master deck for easy dissemination to the class. This means that each person in the class basically has a personally annotated version of the master deck which represents tons of wasted effort looking up extra facts background info figures etc. ,medicalschool,d864v2s,11,t5_2re2p

What Ive found to be most helpful is to employ active learning.Passively reading textbooks and listening to lecturestaking notes is a great start and may help you know the material well but it wont apply to getting good scores on exams especially if they are board format exams.Id recommend pretending each topic is a presentation you have to give in front of the class I do this myself it helps me a ton and learn it so that you can teach it.  Then also do a ton of practice problems from things like First Aid or PrepU anatomy or U Michigan.Active learning after the passive learning will likely raise your test scores.  Another resource Ive found incredibly helpful is Aclands DVD Atlas of Human Anatomy.  For me it was a lifesaver for memorizing everything and it is with a real cadaver so it will translate to improving your practical scores as well unlike Netters which is drawn images.Also get that wrist checked out right after the test!,medicalschool,d8el4lk,2,t5_2re2p

Lecture and audio dont seem to be doing it for you but consider medical textbooks talking through lectures with friends etc. find one resource that works for you and maybe one more to supplement things that confusing and build your base of information although slowly unfortunate and then attack question.

My final grade ended up being a  with a pass threshold of  so its not like I bombed it but if you think impostor syndrome is bad when youre eking by on exams just imagine how it felt when you fail the very first assessment you ever take in your medical career. Crushing.I emailed the Dean the minute I saw the score confessed my sins of laziness and ignorance got myself into the tutoring program and survived the rest of M and M.

9496385,0,t1_d9jc4x1,How about this?Have an Interview Match. You rank all the programs you want using the same criteria you use for deciding where to apply. Programs rank every applicant based on Step scores grades home school familiarity with applicant etc most of which could be autosorted.  Then the Interview Match uses a similar algorithm as the real Match but entering in  or so duplicates for each student to represent the average of  applications per student.Each program is then presented with a couple hundred matched applicants they can review more in depth with LORs and personal statements. They would rerank based on this information and another match would occur. This time each applicant would get  duplicates representing the typical  Interviews of Safety or less if they are feeling cocky and the programs would have one duplicate for each interview slot they have available. Programs then get a magical list of finalized interviewees and applicants get a magical list of  interviews locations. Magical because it is guaranteed to be the most stable configuration which means no canceling months of stressful waiting or expensive last minute plane tickets in January to your dream program.Okay so the math is fuzzy but Im confident you could hire a couple broke math grad students who would be overjoyed with the task of figuring it out. I think you could even do some fancy math using interview dates to make the results optimal with no date conflicts for each list of  interviews.It seems complicated but once you get the system set up it could actually streamline the process for students and programs. Students pay one price for a reasonable guarantee of  interviews at least as reasonable as applying to  programs will get you currently and programs have a way of filtering applicants out of the pool of the couple hundred they are able to review in depth who are just being overly cautious and would reject an interview. No more wasted time reading their statements and LORs.I dont even think people who apply to more than  will be at a disadvantage here compared to the current system. The Interview Match would allow for an indefinite number of initial rankings all at the same cost. So if you are a less competitive applicant you dont have to guess which of the  out of the  least competitive programs care least about your specific application weakness. You just rank them all and find out. You are in essence ranking and interviewing at the programs you would otherwise be scrambling in.But it seems like this system would bring in less revenue for ERAS so it will never happen.,medicalschool,d9jmr3i,9,t5_2re2p

There is  stigma associated with mental illness and I have known people with disorders such as bipolar I who were given a tough time in medical school to the point of almost being forced out. Its perceived negatively regardless of efforts to minimize stigmatization and increase acceptance.  I would see a cognitive psychologist for CBT therapy to see if that could help or another family physician as some are willing to treat mental illness.

I dont know if its  or  but as far as ethical debate goes its not really relevant. If you have numbers to back up your claims feel free to share. I realise those numbers will be different between the US and Europe Part if I wanted to get circumcised Well lets turn it around how many people who arent circumcised wish they had been? How many uncircumcised boys would actually grow up and have to endure this worse form of circumcision? Just as most circumcised people dont wish they hadnt been circumcised most uncircumcised people dont wish they had. I think its better to leave that up to the person when hes an adult. Lots of cosmetical procedures would be less painful if performed on newborns. Doesnt mean we just perform them just in case because they might or might not want them done when they grow up anyway. forcing their opinions on the rest of societyAs you might expect I disagree fundamentally here.

9974018,0,t3_5idrc1,Practice practice practice. Do as thorough an exam as you can on every patient given time constraints and try to stay to the same exam routine. In the beginning this means that yes youll be checking off EOMI and PERRLA on patients with a sore ankle. But you need to use every opportunity to repeat a thorough physical as many times as possible before youll truly become comfortable. The end result will be that you can do a thorough physical in your sleep and youll have seen a wide variety of normal results to all of your physical exam techniques so youll be able to appreciate an abnormal finding when you see one.Finally some more specific tips dont be afraid to touch the patient to establish a comfortable distance at which you will be working. A good example is gently resting your hand on the patients shoulder while you auscultate the chest. It gives them a sense of where you are and how close youre going to be getting to them which in spite of the extra physical contact actually makes it less awkward. Also get good at giving verbal cues. Even if in the beginning youre babbling a bunch of jargon just having a constant patter of information in a calm voice helps decrease the patients anxiety and conveniently fills up awkward silences.,medicalschool,db7n44r,2,t5_2re2p

I spent a few weeks doing medicallyrelated volunteering and to be honest it was underwhelming and gave me almost no sense of how medicine was practiced in that country. IMO physicians are unlikely to spend a ton of time talking to and teaching a foreign medical student that is only around for a couple of weeks.

I struggled at the beginning of M with studying since Im not someone who studied a lot in college and it was a rough transition. I also developed some test anxiety that made it worse. Worst of all the material you learn in M is so dull especially for people who like to see practicalclinical applications for things. I didnt realize how much I hated basic science until I had to study it as much as M forced me to. I actually thought M was better since by then I knew how to study and I was getting much better grades while studying the same amount of time because I was doing it more efficiently. The material I learned during M was significantly more interesting as well. Now that Im a M I am loving med school. This is what I came here to do. It gets better!

So Ive been reading that you need to email some programs that you may be interested in doing aways at because they have a preVSAS waitlist or something like that. Is now the right time to start emailing programs or wait until January?Also lets say you decline some of the away offers assuming you get a lot of acceptances that you may get out of the  that you apply to. Does any harm come from declining the spots you get offered to do aways at come interview season? The reason I ask is because depending on the speciality I believe some programs look down on you if you end up declining aways offer.

If a home student is interested in a home program I would think the program would have been made fully aware of it by the student ages ago.  Interview spots and resources are limited and if you get an interview then its because you deserved it more than someone else who didnt get your spot.  Its a numbers game...programs have a set number of spots to fill and they wager in their own planning committees how many people they have to rank in order to fill those spots....and thats how many people they interview.  In fact i interviewed at  programs and almost every one of them rattled off the stat how far down we had to go on our match list to fill last year and the average over  years.

And  blunt dissection  to find or follow a structure without accidentally destroying it insert your scissors closed into the tissue then open them and repeat several times.

I think that being familiar with how things in the body are laid out will help you tremendously while having to remember different names for things seems like it will be a passing inconvenience.

Med schools love to see kids who held actual jobs so thats not really it though standardized testing noted. Shadowing... shouldnt have been that hard. That may have been a function of location. It only took me  emails to find a doc who was willing and there were  connections involved but I also had access to a major academic medical center in driving distance. Interviews are an investment and not spending money on them is more a reflection on not knowing what to do.Its your secondtolast point that really takes the cake here. It explains why we see tons of highly qualified rich white kids and rich middle class or straight up poor asianindianmiddle eastern kids. Theres a reason why SES isnt nearly as much of a barrier for ORM students. Its culture. My asian roommate is the son of immigrants but he was encouraged to work hard and play the academic game his whole life. He knew from day  in college that he needed great grades publications clinical experience and a killer MCAT. Yes he needed to work a job on the side but his parents raised him to have the kind of time management skill and career focused attitude that meant handling an extra  hoursweek of work was cake in undergrad. He had older family friends and relatives assessing his resume every step of the way telling him to shadow more or join a particular club. Meanwhile I have a friend whose father is a venture capitalist and whose mother has mental problems. She can afford any amount of tutoring MCAT classes whatever. She finished college with a . GPA and is still trying to remedy her GPA for med school. Her father never had time for her and her mother was more of a responsibility than a mentor.

I feel bad for the women in my field because its hard for them to assert themselves without coming across as a stereotypical catty OBGYN resident where the same behavior by a male surgeon may be shrugged off. But to answer your question the way to avoid the stereotype is to remain respectful of your peers. Our specialty can be very stressful and its important to keep a good perspective and try to be patient. I thought the residents at my school did a good job of including students and making us feel useful so thats how I try to pay it forward to my students.

There is a separate section for publications and abstracts where you wont be able to add it if your name isnt on it I wouldnt anyway. As long as something is in that section programs will be happy.

They will surely macerate the airway before they call me to intubate the now difficult airway but they have me on speed dial for every other little thing.Intubating MonkeysIf you ask me this kind of ER doc is the result of our litigious society as well as the healthcare system that has determined that patient care is cheaper outside the ER...Im going to say it...with REAL DOCS.

10929100,0,t3_5vy8l8,In my experience FMG gets less interviews for equivalent applications but during the interview people are treated the same.The way I see it once you get that interview thats the great equalizer. Everyone is the same because you all met the basic criteria to be a resident at that program.Interview serve a pretty specific purpose for you and for the program to see if its a good fit. Every program have subtle differences. They just have a different feel. Never got asked this question but was asked why I attended school outside NA. Answer honestly and be precise with it.  for me its about who you are. Are you someone that people can work with for the next  to  years? Are you a weirdo? Can you meet criteria and pass boards so the residency meets ACGME goals?  Tough question but I would. Or you could phrase the question as What is the biggest pro and con of this program. In some ways IMGFMG are perceived to be inferior. And thats OK. Thats something people are aware of when going to school abroad. But you can spin it in a positive way such that you are passionate about becoming a doctor and would do anything to achieve your goals. You should really have a positive frame of mind because if you start to feel inferior during the interview you are going to act defensive. Be yourself well a better version of it. Be interested.

11140984,0,t3_5yve1t,A pregnant uterus contains the placenta umbilical cord and the fetus in the amniotic sac.The placenta supplies all of the nutrients and oxygen to the baby and also removed all of the waste.  The nutrients pass from mom  placenta  umbilical artery  baby  babys heart  the rest of babys body  umbilical veins  placenta  mom moms liver kidneys and lungs get rid of the waste.The baby lives in a fluid filled sac.Amniotic fluid is constantly being produced and reabsorbed all of the fluid is most likely replaced at least once a day.The baby fills the sac with its own pee and then drinks it.  Too little liquid is called oligohydramnios.  The are two ways this can happen  too little is being produced or fluid is being lostThe reason for too little being produced is that the baby isnt peeing or isnt peeing enough.  This can be due to a problem in the urinary tract  kidneys not working or never formed or something blocking the urinary tract.  Remember that the baby does NOT have to swallow fluid in order to make pee because mom is sending fluids via the placenta.  Imagine a hospitalized patient that has an IV and is NPO nothing via the mouth.  Are they swallowing liquids? No.  Are they still making pee? Yes! Another common reason for too little liquid production is uteroplacental insufficiency.  This means the placenta isnt doing its job and the baby isnt receiving enough nutrients fluids or oxygen.  This could be its own topic.Now think of how fluid can be lost.  How to most pregnant women lose fluid?  When they go into labor and the amniotic sac ruptures her water broke!  Unfortunately some pregnant women start loosing fluid earlier and sometimes the amniotic sac even breaks before term preterm premature rupture of membranes.  This could also be its own topic.Polyhydramnios is less complicated.  Skipping details and less common causes there is too much liquid due to either baby cant swallow liquid.  This can be due to a GI defect esophagus does not connect to stomach duodenum not formed or due to a nervous system defect baby has no brain genetic problems. Or mom is diabetic and poorly controlled.,medicalschool,deuti56,1,t5_2re2p

Strengths good grades good test taker Weaknesses not enough faculty support not super impressive research. ampnbspI guess my advice about not downplaying your accomplishments back fired. Ive always pushed being open and honest but I think sometimes it makes certain messages less palatable. It is important in posts like these though that people dont get false hope. The whole if I can do it then you can too is just not helpful. I dont want people to get false hope that oh if I have crap step scores and terrible clerkship grades but work really hard that I will match into plastics a second time around. That just isnt how this system works. ampnbspPeople are missing the key here which is that with a realistic assessment of where you need improvement the right strategy and a determination to follow through on your plans you will be able to move towards your goals.

She advised me to apply to  programs and I would be fine. I applied to  got  interviews none in the Top . Had I listened to her I might have gotten  interviews at best and been at serious risk of not matching. My advice is always that if you have anything which might be considered a red flag overapply. Whatever the cost of overapplying will be its tiny compared to the anguish of going unmatched and the loss of even one years attending salary.

11244340,0,t3_60e9gu,My SO and I met in undergrad and he chose to follow me wherever I ended up for medical school because we didnt want to do long distance. He understood how much studying I would need to be doing and I made sure he knew that med school had to be my  priority for the next  years. I think its all about time management and making time together truly quality time. If my SO was working until PM on a weekday night Id make sure to try to get the majority of my studying done while he was at work so once he got home we could spend time together. Doing chores like grocery shopping together means an extra hour every week we have to talk and spend time with each other even if its while doing a menial task. Every relationship has its ups and downs and med school especially during Step studying has definitely been a challenge for our relationship. But I cannot tell you enough how comforting it is to have someone there who is not in medical school to talk to about nonmedical school things. I love having him around to vent to when Im frustrated about a quiz or a test because hes wonderful at reminding me of the big picture.  Another important thing is making sure that your SO is independent enough to develop a life outside of you  having a job and his own friendscoworkers and getting involved in the community are important so hes not dependent on you for entertainment.

I feel like when you look at the upper echelon of residencies they have to select from multiple equally qualifiednearly equally qualified candidates to fill their residency spots and thats kinda where school name recognition MD vs DO institution comes into play i could be wrong but i dont think there are many institutions that would select a candidate with a  step  over a candidate with a  step one purely due to name recognition of the institution they got their medical education from.

11458114,0,t1_dfuocyl,Yes.  The study was crap.EDIT Sorry I realized I shouldnt be so dismissive.  Here are some reasons why the study was crapDid the study address an appropriate question to begin with?While this is debatable Id say that no its not an appropriate question.  Research questions should examine things which are actionable.  For example if a study found that men are at a higher risk of developing colon cancer than women it might lead to genderspecific screening guidelines.  Or if a study found that hospitals which worked their residents in  hr shifts had worse patient outcomes than one which worked their residents in  hr shifts it might lead to changes in how academic hospitals schedule their housestaff.  But to ask if male vs. female hospitalists had better mortality outcomes among a certain group of hospitalized patients is not helpful.  Men cant become women and medical schools arent going to stop admitting men.The authors make reasonable hypotheses in the discussion about the male vs. female difference.  But why werent these the questions asked?  For example does hospitalist adherence to clinical guidelines lead to lower mortality?  That result would be actionable and useful and would not lead to polarizing gender politics.  But of course it also wouldnt be a flashy clickbait ready finding.Was the study actually valid i.e. did the study accurately answer the question it proposed?Once again Id say no or at least we cant be sure.  There were numerous methodological flaws but here are the most notableA. When looking at readmission rates based on physician gender it is far more logical to base it upon the gender of the physician on the day of discharge since they are responsible for determining whether discharge is appropriate and what the  discharge plan will be.  However the authors essentially used the gender of the physician who billed the most during the stay.  B. Hospitalists switch on and off throughout a patients hospitalization.  Typically the daytime hospitalist switches every  days while there is a different nighttime hospitalist every day.  There also may be different coverage during weekends.  Trying to attribute the care a patient receives to a single physician is impossible to do.  A patient who stays in the hospital for  days could easily be seen by  different hospitalists over the course of their hospitalization.C. There was no attempt to ascertain the reason for or consequence from the observation that female hospitalists had far fewer annual hospitalizations compared to male hospitalists . vs. ..  There is obviously some important reason for the dramatic difference. Was this because female hospitalists work shorter shifts are more likely to work parttime or are more likely to work at quieter periods of the day andor week?  All of these possibilities could explain the observed differences in mortality and readmission but were neither examined nor even acknowledged by the authors.How should publication bias impact the interpretation of this study?With a study such as this one in which a result in the opposite direction i.e. female doctors having worse outcomes would have next to zero chance of publication we must view it that much more skeptically.  There may have been  prior studies showing that female doctors have worse outcomes and we would never know.   For the record my gut feeling  which is of course worth very little  is that such unpublished studies dont exist and that the gender of the hospitalist is not associated with risk of mortality or readmission.All of this certainly doesnt mean that Tsugawas paper was necessarily wrong but I think its wise to be highly skeptical of it.,medicalschool,dfurpe0,6,t5_2re2p

Step  CK is one of the most underrated parts of med school  its not as bad as Step  but its still quite difficult and should be taken seriously. I had a month of dedicated study right after finishing M which was perfect for me. Main tools . UWorld  once during rd year another x  incorrects during dedicated.. Master the Boards  provided a framework for subjectbased studying filled it in with UWorld notes. Supplemental tools  casually listened to Online MedEd audio during breaks. quickly read through USMLE Step  Secrets x  during the . weeks of studying.  went through old IM NBME practice shelf exams SUPER helpful. free  practice exam the day before great confidence booster.Selfassessments Completed all UWSA and NBME practice exams. The NBMEs are chiller than the UWSAs but UWSAs have a kinder curve. These practice exams are NOT easy  I got a  on the UWSA  weeks before my test! Luckily you can improve very quickly. I ended up scoring close to the last NBME practice exam I took  days before the test. Difficulty of the real test was somewhere between the NBMEs and UWSAs.Otherwise main thing that was helpful for me is that I actually took the time to try to discuss questions and concepts I didnt understand outloud with my study partners. We randomly quizzed each other the whole month on different factoids. This was very different from Step  where we mostly stayed alone in our own heads trying to get through UWorld as quickly as possible. I also changed up the way I read questions  instead of just reading through start to finish I would read the first sentence or so read the last sentence read the answer choices and then go back and skim through the details. Made my testtaking much quicker and more efficient and helped me develop a sort of gut feeling for what the NBME wanted. Feel free to ask any questions I am by no means an expert but Im really happy with how this exam turned out!,medicalschool,dfvpfh9,30,t5_2re2p

The doctor runs in and grab her arm to prevent this and she decks him in the face with her other arm.  Without any hesitation the doc former D lineman grabs this chick by the hair and neck and slams her on her bed holding her down.  Then her boyfriend methed out looking dude jumps up with clinched fist yelling get the fuck off of her Ill kill you!. This doc was not phased a bit.  While still pinning the girl down by her head he gets in the boyfriends face and yells sit your fucking ass down!. His lips start quivering and he attempts to tackle the doc but the cops who are already in the room at this point bring him to the ground and take him out if the ED.

11637605,0,t1_dgf46qt,gt First apologies in the sense that you mean are made voluntarily by the physician without being first interrogated by police. This tends to embolden their reliability  why would someone say such a thing unless they believed they were in the wrong?As I said above this kind of thing happens all the time. Havent you ever taken full or partial blame for something just to get out of a tough situation?A physician who is confronted by an angry patient might easily apologize for something that isnt his or her fault. They may be nonconfrontational. They may want to get out of a real or perceived danger. They may feel that taking the blame may make things easier for a patient who is casting about for someone to blame. They may feel in the moment that they did something wrong and apologize for it but on further reflection they did not actually make any error. Finally as you are surely aware liability is a legal question and a physician simply isnt trained to determine whether or not they are legally liable for a particular action. Someone may feel they are in the wrong but not actually be legally liable.My point is that people apologize for a lot of reasons. A mere apology is not probative of any particular truth and should not be taken as such.gt If you want to make it to where any type of admission of liability is inadmissible in all cases you certainly are entitled to advocate for that position. But to argue that its permissible in car accidents but not in medical malpractice to me is simply illogical. Well I agree with you there. I dont think it makes sense to allow an offthecuff apology as admissible in any type of civil trial. Pretty much everything Ive said above can be applied to car crashes or whatever.

I am bored with this any yawning because you didnt understand what I said so I had to repeat myself. gt Lawyers I can tell you give absolutely no credence to it because it means nothing at trial.Again you are completely not understanding. No one said that good bedside manner will win a trial for you. No one. Ever. What everyone says is that the best method to not get sued is to have a good bedside manner.   Do you see that that is different than willing a lawsuit?   You are viewing this from a lawyer perspective where your only concern is winning lawsuits.  A doctors primary concern is not having them in the first place. gtBut what I can say is above all else the triggering factor that will prompt a patient to call a lawyer is almost never bedside manner alone. There is some injury coupled with some negligent act that triggers the events to unfold. So what is the conclusion to be drawn?You are arguing against a position that no one has made... why?No shit... you cant sue someone for being rude.  Guess what?  We all know that.  gtHaving said that being nice will not shield you from lawsuits for being negligent. A negligent doctor who irreparably harms a patient will not be immune from suit because the patient is not immune from their injury. Ive actually had a client actively tell me that they trusted and loved the doctor they sued but they simply had no other choice because he made a mistake and caused the patient to suffer harm and expenses.You are viewing this from your limited perspective.  The only people that you meet are the ones that are suing their doctors. You never see or meet or talk to  of patients. Your perspective is severely limited.  gtThus even the nicest warmest doctors who commit thoughtless negligence will be sued. The meanest orneriest doctors who have no bedside manner will be free from suit if they are not negligent and do their jobs appropriately.Every doctor will make mistakes.  Every doctor will be sued at some point.Since you arent one you dont understand this. ,medicalschool,dgf7i0p,0,t5_2re2p

11688603,0,t3_66nhw4,Its VERY easy to get a good gym routine during st and nd year because your days should be pretty regimented and uniform. I had a set schedule where mandatory lectures started at the same time every single day so I just got up at  am every single gym day. Got up at  on nongym weekdays and at  am on nongym weekends. Super duper easy.       rd year was decent as I was mostly at the same hospital but any away rotations made it kinda difficult. I had to sign up for a new gym get into a new routine etc. Surgery was tough because I was getting to the hospital at  am and I couldnt deadlift because my back was so stiff from standing in the OR holding retractors or holding a camera whose angle is always miraculously . different than what the surgeon likes causing him to have a fit. The fact that you start and end at a different time each month can be a bit annoying especially if youre like me and you hate going after work I prefer to have it all done before I show up. Id recommend just getting up at the same time every day or at least within an hour of that time to keep your schedule straight and make it easier to stick to it. You better believe youll get a few compliments or glances when you show up to your  am ER shift and youve got a good lookin pump under those scrubs.      th year is tough. I did one audition and some aways at different hospitals to get good experienceexposure to other hospital systems. Tack on driving to interviews staying at hotels being on interviews etc. and it becomes difficult. I slipped quite a bit during th year and only got in two days my normal is four days on many weeks. My diet got crappy too.        Youll be fine. My BPDLSq total went up by like  pounds between st and nd year and about  pounds in third year. It probably went down a few pounds in th year. Just make it work and remember that gym and health should be a priority. Fuck everyone else thats watching Netflix all day or dickin around because they dont HAVE TO study for their shelf coming up. Get your gym out of the way in the morning ASAP and do your shit. Everyone that says you dont have time for the gym assuming theyre not failing rotations and barely getting by is a fuckin liar or a lazy fuck. Get off Netflix and go lift.      EDIT      gtCurious to hear others experience especially third years. Im dreading third year already from the stories I hear. I currently allocate about . hours a day for lifting and from the looks of it thats a long shot for third year.        You said youre just finishing first year? Dude stop worrying about rd year jeez! Just get through nd year and Step  first. Stop worrying about shit thats more than a year away. Get your schedule and your discipline strong NOW and youll be fine.

October  will be first time borrowers that started program will be avail for forgiveness so it will be interesting to see what happens. Law was never intended to help rich doctors and I think  Congressmedia is gonna flip a shit when they here some interventional cards  doc making K a year just got  wiped away. I would keep payments low  during residency. The REPAYE has interest subsidies built in so interest does not accumulate as rapidly during residency and then throw  per year at it as an attending until it is paid off. ,medicalschool,dgnt1wr,32,t5_2re2p

11739757,0,t1_dgqppli,ok id agree youd have BETTER chances if applying from a more competitive med school. but i personally know people at lesser competitive med schools that matched into great specialties ex  ortho and ophtho. one thing these individuals had in common were excellent board scores and high class ranks. OP it can be done. it wont be a walk in the park but there are plenty of applicants from lesser competitive med schools going into competitive specialty. also look at RPDoctors response below. ,medicalschool,dgqqc83,6,t5_2re2p

11760943,0,t1_dgppsrq,Yes it is absolutely is better I did some of my IM at a nice suburban hospital where patients have insurance and social support and just generally have the resources to take care of themselves. Taking care of patients who are able to actually use your help is a lot more rewarding than treating the social trainwrecks and people at the fringes of society for whom you work so hard to ultimately make no difference. Plus the nice nurses staff and facilities make it such a more pleasant environment to work than the county hospital. ,medicalschool,dgt4s4r,1,t5_2re2p
11763318,0,t1_dgsv6kg,Yup. Aint it true. The health of doctors themselves is poor because we have so little time to care about it. Its for sure a problem and Im sure a reason why burnout is so high,medicalschool,dgtegkw,4,t5_2re2p

My boyfriend and I made games with each other like we would race and see who gets to draw all the arteries of the GI system first and stuff like that. It sounds silly but it made it fun and it put pressure on us to memorize things like that in an unconventional way,medicalschool,dgw2t0v,1,t5_2re2p
