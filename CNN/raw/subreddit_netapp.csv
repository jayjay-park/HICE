3084691,0,t1_cohk4er,Did support have you grab a perfstat?  Just wondering how they determined this was a spindle issue.  Of course it probably is just wondering what they based that on.I figure your account team will suggest another shelf.  For futures sake and if your budget allows a DS perhaps half populated.  It will be future proof for a few more years can support a FAS controller if you want GbE and perhaps the next generation after that.  As well as SSDs and larger SAS drives.As far as adding a few SSDs for a FlashPool it will indeed be a considerable boost to performance especially latency. ,netapp,cohq69e,2,t5_2r5pd

3753807,0,t3_33e7tf,You can use wildcards in cluster mode commands. If the volumes have common names you can do something likevol move start verserver name volume lab destination aggregate aggYou can also whip up a list of individual command lines then simply paste them into the SSH window. The command prompt will buffer and run them sequentially. Id recommend only doing  or so at a time just to make sure you dont miss any. Is there a reason youre trying to balance across four aggregates? Do you have a four node cluster? ,netapp,cqk5t91,2,t5_2r5pd
4302667,0,t1_cs9y85v,The correct way to do this is set up an initiator group for each server and add the LUNs to just that group. Portsets are not needed until you have so many paths for the linux multipath driver to choose from that you want to trim it down a bit.,netapp,csamvhk,3,t5_2r5pd

If you need more filtering you can hit tab to see lists of subcommands. You can also grab Netapp System Manager which is free to get a GUI representation.,netapp,czu1ibq,2,t5_2r5pd

7152916,0,t3_4di15k,Have you had a look at AWA? id recommend running it on your system first before you add the SSD.if you split the SSD between both controllers it might not work as well as you expect it. AWA will allow you to model the SSD caches and decide where is the best place to deploy them,netapp,d1r7rdp,1,t5_2r5pd
