9983522,0,t1_db8rz0h,Its fine. Playtesting will show but  minutes isnt some ridiculous cooldown either so I guess better have it slightly longer than shorter. And as you said there is always Bull Rush anyway. This charge is really nice now without the patch I was like wtf but with the patch  even though I never used this ability  it seemed very fun and powerful.,axonis,db8vq80,1,t5_3bf8d
