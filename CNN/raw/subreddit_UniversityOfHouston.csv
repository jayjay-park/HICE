Try to work out the circuits for yourself. Over and over and over again. I took ECE  with Trombetta. There was a book but no one really used it as it wasnt required. He has a website that has solutions to old quizzes and exams. You should be able to find the solutions to the homework from someone since the homeworks typically dont change much if at all. But even so the solutions should only be used to check your answers. If you dont practice you wont pass.,UniversityOfHouston,cf24xmp,2,t5_2rpaw

5441971,0,t1_cw7403y,Was going to reply separately but thought it was relevant here as well. I work  in a job I really enjoy and is definitely a career for me. I worked hard to get to where I am and definitely didnt take the easy route. not that school is easy but it is definitely more typical than the path I took. There are lots of opportunities for growth for me with my company and I could possibly get by without ever going back and getting my degree. For me though I want to learn and grow I dont want anything holding me back and I want to go as far as I have an ability. Also both of my parents graduated from UH and it would mean a lot to not only me but my family to do so as well.  All that being said I was excited to enroll and get an undergrad in business. My company will even reimburse me for a good chunk of tuition and will let me expense books. After looking into it I was disappointed to find out that there are little to no options for me to be able to graduate from UH. I thought I would go with mostly night classes some online and be able to hit one class a semester during the day time as my employer is very supportive. Instead I will need to go a different route be it a sister school like UHD which I dont really know how I feel about or another option I havent explored yet. if anyone has a suggestion Im completely open  So I get it. They definitely cater to full time students. I wish there was an option for me to still graduate from a great school. I am sure that getting a degree from another institution will still serve me well and will give me the check in the box... But Im sad I wont be challenged to the same level and get the same type of growth that I might have had from UH.at least until I go back for my MBA!. ,UniversityOfHouston,cw79jb5,3,t5_2rpaw

6406017,0,t3_436epo,Reposted with permission of unishchetaWhen Texas was admitted to the Union its articles of annexation specified that Texas retained its public lands. Typically when unorganized territory joined the Union public lands reverted to the Federal Government which is why the Federal Government today owns like  of the land West of the Mississippi.After the Civil War the legislature wisely took the public lands and split them into two pools. Two thirds went to the Permanent School Fund  a Sovereign Wealth Fund that is used to reduce interest rates on bonds issued by school districts in Texas. One third went to the Permanent University Fund  a separate Sovereign Wealth Fund that paid roughly  of its annual revenues to the two public universities in the state at the time  Texas AampM in College Station and UT Austin.In the beginning this wasnt a whole lot of money. Most of the revenue came from grazing fees ranchers paid the state to be able to graze their cattle on the land. In the s though oil was discovered in West Texas where most of the PSF and PUF land is and so the state began to receive large mineral royalties from the PUF and PSF.The PSF is only relevant to primary and secondary public school districts like HISD. So well leave that one aside for now.In the early th century and later more universities were added to the state Public Higher Education system. Texas Tech then UH then others Angelo State etc. For many reasons probably the most important of which was that Texas had segregated higher education there were black universities and white universities  guess which UT and AampM were as new schools were added they were not added to the PUF.Flash forward to today  the assets in the PUF are worth . B. Each year it pays around M to UT Austin and around M to AampMCollege Station. This effectively doubles the amount of public money from the state UT and AampM receive. The state pays twice as much for a student going to UT Austin as it does for a student to go to UH for example.The problem is that theres no rational basis for this. Clearly UT and AampM are superior schools to UH in terms of program quality...but its very hard to argue that that quality difference isnt a direct result of the massively different levels of funding each school receives. And on top of that UH and the other nonPUF schools are overwhelmingly nonwhite...while UT and AampM remain overwhelmingly white.If UH were to get access to the PUF it could mean an increase in our state funding by as much as M per year. This would be a massive increase in funding which our Administration would surely find a way to mostly squander as UT and AampM do their PUF money...but at least each school would get funded equally.Side Note In the late s the state created the HEAF or Higher Education Assistance Fund. If youre wondering if what Im arguing is just a bunch of whiny not in the cool kids group bullshit this is the proof that its not. HEAF was created to try and level out the funding inequities between public universities ie raise UH Texas Tech et al to the same level as Austin and College Station.The plan was to divert general revenues ie tax dollars into a fund and then have that fund payout to the tier  universities at some later date. The plan was pretty vague but it was a plan. When the Republicans swept into major power in  they dismantled the plan and terminated the funding for HEAF when it reached around M which sounds like a lot of money but is about th as much as the PUF has  and it was to be spread among far more students. All the Tier  nonsense you hear about came about because in the late s the legislature decided to make the HEAF money pay for performance  ie when a school reached some arbitrary criteria to be established by the Higher Education Coordinating Board and only then it would be eligible for HEAF money. Remember circa  when suddenly and miraculously UH was Tier ? That was Dr. Khator playing politics to try and get us the HEAF money.The problem with HEAF is that the legislature was never going to contribute enough money to make it like the PUF  to make it like the PUF the state of Texas would have to contribute BILLIONS per year  the total higher education budget is in the low single billions so you can imagine how unlikely that would be in a state that hates the T word.Its never going to happen because every man woman and child in the legislature is either an alum of UT Austin or College Station  or they have kids who currently go there. And theyd be stupid not to UT Austin and AampM are premiere institutions and they got that way because of huge government spending. It shouldnt be about reducing AampM and UT or taking from what they are given it should be about giving UH students the same that UT and AampM students get. Not because we are as good as or whatever  but because they government doesnt get to pick winners and losers especially not among students.Its also worth noting that UT Austin and AampM College Station violently fight to maintain their control of the PUF. They genuinely believe that they and they alone are entitled to double the average share of state money for their education. Its not entirely clear why most arguments have to do with thats the way its always been who cares of it started because of racism  were not racists now just ignore the fact that all the minorities go to schools other than UT Austin and AampM.,UniversityOfHouston,czhss0w,1,t5_2rpaw

There are also tuition funds that lock in tuition prices for the year your parents enroll in it. These are usually started early on.

10350603,1,t3_5o74q0,Just being nitpicky but Im not sure youre using transient correctly there.Edit didnt realize we had a transient program especially since you cant earn a degree as a transient student. Assumed he meant commuter student given the context and that mentioning that they were transient isnt useful info for the question they asked.  Ive heard that word used wrong more than once in a similar fashion. Anyways hope OP has a good semester or two here until theyre off to their next endeavor. ,UniversityOfHouston,dchauef,1,t5_2rpaw

You should realize sooner rather than later that the executive agenda is fulfilled by subcommittees which are run by SGA senators. If you really feel that strongly about CAPS you need to join the finance committee or the student life committee and quickly. Thats strange.
