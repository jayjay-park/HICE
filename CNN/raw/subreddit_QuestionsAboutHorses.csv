Ranging in size from the relatively small pigeonsized jackdaws Eurasian and Daurian to the common raven of the Holarctic region and thickbilled raven of the highlands of Ethiopia the  or so members of this genus occur on all temperate continents except South America and several islands. In Europe the word crow is used to refer to the carrion crow or the hooded crow while in North America it is used for the American crow fish crow or the northwestern crow. The crow genus makes up a third of the species in the family Corvidae. The members appear to have evolved in Asia from the corvid stock which had evolved in Australia.Crows are omnivorous and their diet is very diverse. They will eat almost anything including other birds fruits nuts mollusks earthworms seeds frogs eggs nestlings mice and carrion. The origin of placing scarecrows in grain fields resulted from the crows incessant damaging and scavenging although crows assist farmers by eating insects otherwise attracted to their crops. Crows reach sexual maturity around the age of  years for females and  years for males. Clutch size is approximately three to  eggs and the nesting period lasts between  and  days.In Ancient Greece and Rome several myths about crows and jackdaws included An ancient Greek and Roman adage told by Erasmus runs The swans will sing when the jackdaws are silent meaning that educated or wise people will speak after the foolish become quiet. The Roman poet Ovid saw the crow as a harbinger of rain Amores  . Pliny noted how the Thessalians Illyrians and Lemnians cherished jackdaws for destroying grasshoppers eggs. The Veneti are fabled to have bribed the jackdaws to spare their crops.Much of the information here is from my own research on crows in central New York where I used other sources I have tried to reference the material.

This page is still very much under construction Last updated  November Overall a very solid film which is more of a who dunnit? than thriller its not tense enough to be called a thriller. The films dark title kinda gives you the wrong impression really the film is more like a classic mystery from the  s era of the silver screen..   ,QuestionsAboutHorses,cx30mc7,1,t5_2t102
