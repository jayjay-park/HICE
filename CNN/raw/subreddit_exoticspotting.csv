4486670,0,t1_csvu10u,gtLike if these engines were this capable Lamborghini would have done something like this right? They arent exactly staking their reputation on engine reliability. Making that much power does require a lot more hardware. The price would go much higher and I dont think they want to sell at the price point itd reach with all those mods. Also their current goal is not to make hp cars. Surely Lamborghini could do it if they wanted to. But thats a serious weapon and they currently manage to extract a great deal of performance in the hp range. With that comes better reliability. While not their main goal sales would greatly suffer if a several hundred thousand dollar car needed an engine rebuild after  miles. Another thing to consider is that things are currently set up in a balanced manner. The brakes are proportionate to the acceleration and speed abilities. The driver assists are as well. All sorts of stuff. Turning the engine into a complete beast would require other expensive upgrades and a much more sophisticated software setup for avoiding loss of control. In my opinion its good that they dont have that much power right out of the factory. There are too many inexperiencedyoung drivers getting a supercar and destroying it in an accident endangeringhurtingkilling themselves and others. Double the power and instances of that would likely quintuple in quantity and double in severity. I think things are great as they are right now. Out of the factory Lamborghinis and other supercars are already waaayy too fast to fully utilize on public roads. And thats fine. In fact its awesome. But doubling the power out of the factory is unnecessary and serious overkill. Its reserved for a select few who want to put down an additional  or whatever it may be to make it that much crazier. They can drive around very carefully perhaps on low boost show off their monster and then crank the boost up at the drag strip on occasion to really open them up. Im sure these   hp Lamborghinis are very difficult to tame on the track for even highly skilled drivers. You cant just mash it out of a turn or youll spin out instantly. I have yet to see any video of lap comparisons for such upgraded cars by the way. Plenty of drag races of course but no circuit comparisons with their stock counterparts. Now imagine someone getting daring on the road with one. Its just asking for mayhem.TLDR  Nah. Power overkill imbalanced over vehicle system andor too high a price point.,exoticspotting,csw7hl1,3,t5_2t5i6
