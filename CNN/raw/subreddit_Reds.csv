213390,0,t1_cf2qsv7,I havent even dove into sabermetric stats. OBP and SLG and OPS arent sabermetric stats theyre pretty traditional baseball stats. FIP xFIP WAR fWAR oWAR etc.. are all sabermetric stats. But I ask the question I did because I dont know how you can attribute RBIs to an ability of the player. I reiterate is it true that a guy with a . AVG .OBP and RBI is worse than a hitter with a . AVG . OBP and RBI? RBIs are a terrible stat because it is indicative of the performance of the players in front of the batter. Like wins and losses for pitchers. If a pitcher has a .

515522,0,t3_1zzgi0,agreed that he was out.Like I said in the gameday thread the replay ruling was stands which means they didnt see enough evidence to overturn the call there are  possible rulings stands confirmed and overturned. They only got the outfield angle to review and not the infield angle.  Speculating on my part I think that the ump couldnt really decide from that angle if his front foot hit the bag or not it didnt and he just went with the ump who was standing over the play.

Our cleanup hitter is the definition of streaky and Votto would rather take a walk than drive a run in. Why is Price already tinkering with things?

931613,0,t3_24r0y8,Im going to voice a different thought process about Jay and our outfield.While I certainly would prefer Jay never be hurt at all I dont think losing him will actually hurt us as bad as many ESPN seem to think it will. Heres why.His BA is . which is pretty hurtful for our offense especially when he goes up and swings at three straight pitches. His OBP is a respectable . which will be missed. Short term I think that a platoon of Ludwick HamiltonSchumakerHeisey will actually be better than having Bruce out there assuming he wasnt about to catch fire soon. Also assuming that Billy doesnt reinjure his knuckles and comes back swinging a decent bat. He was really killing it offensively before he went down hopefully that can continue but reasonably speaking Im just hoping he can hit somewhere between ... Thatd be plenty.I think Heisey is swinging a much better bat than Bruce so far this season and when faced with important RISP positions Heisey has been very productive hitting . and getting on base at a . clip.The possibility of seeing more of Skip is exciting to me too simply because we get to see how he will turn out with some additional starts. Although he went  yesterday he had some great at bats and some very loud outs. Id bet hell prove to be a very position signing for us.Get healthy soon Jay. Weve had more than our fair share of injuries so far this season theres no sense in thinking we cant overcome another.Go CIN,Reds,cha6ggb,2,t5_2sbv5

We have a number of middle infielders albeit non are excitementworthy that can fill in for the time being Ramon Santiago Skip Schumaker before the concussion and Kristopher Negron.gt Second it was a double boneheaded move to not have any depth at first base at all.Very very few National League teams carry more than one first basemen. Beyond that there is no point in wasting a roster spot along with the money to back up one of the very best players in the game today. Soto and Pea should have been enough depth at first base  unfortunately Votto did get hurt.

4462908,0,t1_cst71ww,  Wins is  wins its tough for anybody in baseball to put that many in a row together doesnt matter who theyre playing and the Reds have certainly padded their total against some less than stellar opponents too. You also have to look at the way they did it theyre destroying the ball right now not squeaking out  wins. Sure the Reds should have taken at least a game in this series I just dont understand why so many people think its unfathomable to lose three in a row to the Brewers like the Brewers are such an embarrassment to the game of baseball that simply taking the field guarantees you at least one win. Its the same way weve treated the Cubs the last few years but I bet wed all trade the last three years to have the team theyve built going forward.And one last point about the pitching in the series. You say the Brewers had mediocre pitching but the Reds didnt exactly trot out three aces. We had Fiers vs Lorenzen Nelson vs Smith and Jungmann vs Leake. Lorenzen was the only one who started the game with a lower ERA than his opponent barely. If the Brewers had mediocre pitching in this series then I dont even know what to call the Reds.,Reds,cst889z,1,t5_2sbv5

They simply do not get fans out to their games despite putting out a decent product. In Tampa Bays case it is actually the city of St. Petersburg that is handcuffing the club and keeping them hostage of their venue despite craving a new field.Keep in mind Tampa Bays field was not built for the Rays. It was built eight years before the team joined the MLB. They are not taxpayer funded to the same degree as what you were talking about.If this move was made the AL East would then be MontrealTorontoNYYBostonBaltimore which would be great for division rivalries and a recipe for success for our second club.,Reds,cw5hv15,4,t5_2sbv5

While youre correct the dynamic is different you can still find interesting people to talk to in your section and if you walk around the stadium. People are there for entertainment and are usually in a good mood and consuming alcohol. All the necessary pieces are in place for casual conversation. Ive had wonderful experiences at minor league baseball games going alone and meeting people from all walks of life that Id never have met had I not bought the ticket. For the GABP Id buy a ticket anywhere and just find a seat since so many are empty. Could be a great way to talk to different people changing sections a few times during the game. ,Reds,d5umqgh,7,t5_2sbv5

I would steal  and only one Eric Davis card every time I was there and pay for the rest of my stuff. Somewhere back home I still have a binder full of nothing but Eric Davis cards. Has to be somewhere in the  card range too. A real shame how ED got hurt during the  WS and how his time as a Red came to an end and how he was treated by ownership.
