3674,0,t3_1u5q2e,Great stuff. I admire anyone who plays their guitar this way as I couldnt play more than a measure of this sort of thing right now. If I can offer any criticism itd be to work on maintaining a steady tempo the tempo drifts quite a bit in sections. I know you are switching between feels but even when you are in one you are having trouble maintaining a steady quarternote.Also Im not a fan of the planned time changes here. It doesnt help the song at all. Instead of changing the actual tempo via metric modulation or just slowing down think about using slower subdivisions but keeping the tempo the same.I loved it though.

17010,0,t3_1uakv5,One thing people often forget after they learn the basic scales is how to play chromatically.  Leaning the basic major scales and pentatonics is really just a starting point its up to you to experiment add and subtract notes sharpen and flatten some.  But if you really want to break out and keep theoretically official a ton of exotic and obscure scales are are just slightly altered major scales.  Look up the phrygian dominant mode or the hungarian minor scales for a good place to start.  Raga scales are where its at if you want some cool melodic fluidity.  But even then I stress you learn and experiment for yourself.  The chromatic scales it the most free and diverse one there is. its all you knew when you first picked up a guitar dont forget howto use it!It took me four years to paint like Raphael but a lifetime to paint like a child.

A few weeks ago my girlfriend and I went to see a production of A Chorus Line Id never seen it and only knew one song from the show One. It was fun they had a live band and the cast were good singers. Musical theater is not exactly my thing but live performances of almost anything get my juices flowing. Near the end of the show there is a point where the cast are singing in harmony and counterpoint if thats the correct term and it just opened my head in a way thats hard to describe it felt like taking a drink or getting a rush from a drug or runners high or something.Stevie Wonder or Tom Waits or Mozart can do this for me but I just feel like Im under water.

92629,0,t1_ceoyudb,Well I think the existence of the se range makes it feel like that. With Gibson the workmanship of their cheaper guitars is inconsistent so when you pay for a full price one theres a tangible difference. The Korean made prs already have great workmanship so the difference is much smaller. The tuners are a bit better a slightly better tremolo and the construction of the guitar itself. The full price customs have a top made from a single piece of wood iirc. But you dont get better fretwork because on the se models its already great etc,Guitar,ceoz4d7,1,t5_2qi79

118468,0,t1_cerwi2k,Id have to disagree. Before Paramore hit the scene there was never really any dark pop punk. It was all upbeat and happy sounding and even the angry songs were usually written in major time signatures. Songs in minor generally got heavier and moved towards traditional hardcore punk. What Josh wrote that was angry or sad stayed upbeat while keeping the pop punk sound and not straying into different genres though some argue they actually did stray into a knew genre.If you have examples of Paramoreesque music from before they were around though Id like to compare it and see how much resemblance there is.,Guitar,cerx6ff,1,t5_2qi79

126282,0,t3_1vj245,A lot of bandswritersproducers write songs on piano first. Some think its much easier to develop melodies and chord progressions on piano. The keys Eb Ab and Bb are all fairly standard keys signature for piano players because the chords and scales are relatively simple to play. However Eb and Ab are pretty bad keys for guitarists since youll have to bar every chord. Consequently people tune down a halfstep because the open E major chord is now an Eb chord. Same with A major.,Guitar,cest8cz,34,t5_2qi79
127257,0,t3_1vjbza,It was probably set up for lower tension for drop tuning when you got it. You need to adjust probably tighten in your case the truss rod in the neck in tiny increments in the tuning you want to counteract the dip and then possibly raise the bridge a bit to avoid buzzing contact on other frets. Be prepared for your guitar to play differently in different tunings. If you set it up for standard tuning and then drop tune you will most likely get buzzing and vise versa. If you like doing having different tunings on the fly then I recommend having two different guitars set up for the tuning you would like. ,Guitar,cesx8bk,1,t5_2qi79

Tube amps do require more maintenance than solid states but it very minor things like replacing some of the tubes when they burn out preamp tubes are cheap.  Solid states on the other hand require less maintenance but are much more expensive to fix ifwhen they break.  Because the parts are all chipbased theres a lot of parts and labor costs if the amp can even be fixed at all.  Theres a good chance that youll just have to buy a whole new amp if it breaks.Think of it this way Would you rather buy a tube amp that is less expensive to repair and will last longer with some minor maintenance or a solid state that will require little maintenance but you might have to buy a whole new amp if it breaks.,Guitar,cetl7ip,2,t5_2qi79

I understand that this is a viable option for those that cannot afford more but if you can afford better there is no reason to stay with that particular tech.

174161,0,t3_1w2873,Another good tip for beginners learn everything you can about tuning amp make sure youre instrument is in tune whenever you start to play and as you go along. One great reason for taking lessons. Many self taught players learn the hard way or give up because of bad tuning.There is someone right now somewhere giving up on guitar saying I suck. This sounds like crap... and in their frustration and self doubt forget to check their tuning Knowing how to properly tune a guitar is an essential part of learning to play. Everyone starting to learn guitar and stringed instruments should find some professional tutorial or advice on this. For instance tune down then up to proper pitch. Know how to tune a guitar without a tuner only a one reference tone and then each string from that properly tuned one. Make sure to fully stretch new strings etc. Always be mindful of your tuning. Does a note or chord sound funny because you are fingering it wrong or is it the tuning? When playing electric guitar especially if you play hard your gonna go out of tune. Some day you will have to learn to not only hear the bad string but tune it on the fly. But for staters you have to always be in tune or else youll not know if youre fingering the chord wrong or if some string is out of tune.  Ive come across several people who were giving up in frustration trying to learn guitar only to find out they were trying to play poorly tuned guitars. This is one reason acoustic guitars are considered better by some people as the best guitar to learn on you dont have to constantly retune them. Having a properly tuned and intonated guitar is the only way to learn.  Once you get the hang of fine tuning youll start to realize that guitars do not have perfect intonation. Thats when youre getting it and your passing an important milestone in the lifelong study of guitar. ,Guitar,cey9qge,4,t5_2qi79

Im  and have been playing for a little over  years now. I feel like Im getting past the point in my life where I have any chance of making a life out of music. I really enjoy playing guitar probably more so then anything else I do in my life. Ive also have gotten very good. Ive written a couple songs and posted them on facebook and my friends and family always tell me how good I sound. They also cant believe its me. Ive also never really given myself a fair chance at pursuing music. I spent high school and college focused on sports. Now Im focusing on my professional career and Im in the middle of law school. I love music and Ill always love playing guitar. Ive never played a gig before and that is one of my dreams. Ideally I would love to play a gig by myself. Sortof unplugged blues stuff.

177376,0,t3_1w45xb, The best guy I ever played with really had a gift. We had certain points in the set where we would bring it down to a lightersofter roar and he would tell some funny story about our trip or complement the town on its hot chicks or something. Always upbeat and positive and the crowd was always jumping higher and punching faster when he was done and we came back into the chorus. Honestly he kind of got me fired up too. A Another guy I played with had some set horrible jokes to go with some songs and a few short stories. I tried to laugh everytime like it was the first time Id heard that hilarious shit. I really just gave people a chance to get off the dance floor. People liked the guy though. B I do a lot of pickup work with singersongwriters getting a band together for the odd fullband show. A lot of these cats cannot bear to not tell the complete story of their motivation for writing this amazing song. I try to keep my head down as though Im doing the intonation and a full analysis of the viability of playing another song on these frets between every song. D I used to work in a big variety band and the singer would end up insulting the crowd or the establishment at about every show. No idea what drove him to do this as he was the same guy that went to the trouble to book these gigs. He would always say Thank you thank you. Both of you. if he thought the crowd was too small things like that. The lesson here is if youre a jerk just keep your mouth shut. Lost a ton of good gigs with that band.

Try plucking hard and close to the bridge or soft and above the fretboard for extremes then mix between the two to find sweet spots. Along those same line of picking in different places theres always strumming behind the nut or bridge or bending the strings there as well. Another thing that can get interesting are harmonics.

227101,0,t3_1woa7t,I used a  original block letter to tour with for a couple years with a x Celestion Vs cab. That thing would scream.   Different issues arise through use. Do you gig with it? Go on tour? Woodshed it in your room? Although a big reason was because of the constant use I did feel like I was going through preamp tubes more than normal but again kind of understandable with the more use part. I have heard of volume issues related to the FX Loop jacks and such but never experienced firsthand  something to look out for I guess.  As suggested I personally would swap out the tubes pre and power when you get it used much like swapping batteries in a new to you device a lot of the time you have no idea iwhen they were last changed or iiif when they were changed last they were changed all together. Last thing you want is a hodgepodge of gotta fix these  pres swap em out and then have the other  go out the following week or month later when you couldve just done them all at once and got it over with. Tube selection also determines the tone youre looking for. Sadly I dont remember which are better for higain offhand but a google search or other users with more experience than I could fill you in there ELs vs L in the power section etc..  guitarnerd said it perfect Get the sound YOU want. It doesnt matter if you have a tone that everyone loves and you hate if youre not into it it wont be as much fun and the love wont be there. Experiment and find a tone that you love and makes playing what you want to play sound awesome. Listen to bands youre into and use their tones as jumping off points and see what you can emulate.

269813,0,t3_1x78st,May I suggest an alternative. Set up a rental. When I started I didnt know if Id carry on with it especially after seeing all my friends who owned guitars for years but never learned how to play. So instead of putting down a large chunk of money to own some gear I rented a guitar for  months and got lessons. The rental was ridiculously cheap like  and they lent me a used Peavey Raptor and Bandit combo starter package. I learned how to play on that guitar which gave me a better idea yet still horribly uninformed of what I wanted to play so I could know when a guitar felt good in my hands instead of buying completely blind. My first guitar after that was an  Ibanez RGdx which I got for . Took me about  years of playing after that to learn what felt good in my hands. ,Guitar,cf8q5r4,2,t5_2qi79

275102,0,t1_cf94mez,Therere a lot of good resources on youtube help you start out.I downloaded audacity to slow down songs and learned them by ear note for note.Oh and dont forget to learn how to improvise with this style as its pretty important. This simply involve you playing licks your learned in different places and seeing how they sound. Youd then tweak and adjust accordingly.Its extremely hard harder than any other style of guitar playing Ive tried and theres a huge emphasis of proper technique alternate picking is NOT good for the gypsy sound  some guys do it but their tone is weak an they have poor projection in my opinion. Learn gypsy picking which is essentially down strokes and rest strokes and upstrokes if you play several notes on one string. It will not make any sense at all at first and it takes about a year to start to get it but the difference is astonishing. Check out Stochelo Rosenberg versus Robin Nolan. Nolans tone is pretty weak whereas Stochelos is bright hard loud and precise.Get the rhythm down right as gypsy jazz lead is almost like playing rhythm on one string at a time.Remember  therere no right and wrongs but true gypsy picking is rare. I have undertaken the challenge to learn it the oldschool way and I prefer my tone now. Plus I can play ordinary lines much quicker louder and more precise than ever before.Hope this helps,Guitar,cf99z0y,1,t5_2qi79

304718,0,t1_cfcciuj,I guess both. If you cannot hear yourself clearly then you probably dont have enough sonic space in the music you are playing. Now obviously your volume could just be too low but if you have even a tiny bit of experience that should be obvious and you can adjust it to everyone level. Now the problem starts to become that in less experienced musicians everyone is playing all over the place playing very busy parts and stepping over each other. They cant really hear themselves because there isnt enough clarity and focus so they try to resolve it by simply being louder. What should be happening is that the bass is occupying its sonic spectrum the guitar or piano has theirs the drums are behind everything and you have SPACE a very underutilized bit of music. You should always be able to hear yourself playing because the other musicians are giving you room to be heard. When your parts comes there is focus on it. When you listen to really great bands youll notice how much it is a conversation between musicians where they take on different roles to make each other sound good. Instead of fighting to be the one in front you need to be thinking how you can make the other people sound better.,Guitar,cfccnou,1,t5_2qi79

310075,0,t1_cfcvver,Why is that unacceptable? Not everyone needs a  fret shredder. In fact a lot of people with large hands prefer  fret necks. I dont know where youre getting the short scale neck thing from but I wasnt aware of any fender style short scales that werent offset shapes jags JMs etc. And even that isnt a knock its a matter of preference. I wont get into it with you over tonewood but a lot of people dont subscribe to the idea that the wood makes any difference. And you do realize that alder is grown in China no? Do you think American alder is superior to Chinese? If you dont care about the name on the headstock a Squier can be a fantastic guitar. Every guitar I ever buy gets a full setup by me. That means fret dressing nut adjustment the whole . The only thing I find that high dollar guitars typically have over the cheaper Asian made ones aside from aesthetic qualities is a lower likelihood of needing a nut or bridge replacement lower chance of shoddy fret work and a higher likelihood that the pups are decent as is. Now sometimes you just want a beauty. Something with a flame or quilted top triple binding MOP or abalone inlays. You just wont find that in a Squier. But were talking a player here not a looker. For a guy that just wants to buy a guitar and play it out of the box the cheap ones can cause issue. But if youre able to work on it and were planning on it anyways its really not any worry. The only reason I shy away from Squier is the lower resale value. But as for having a great player a Squier can be just as good as any. And any of the classic vibes Ive seen have been pretty damn nice. ,Guitar,cfcwobn,1,t5_2qi79

If its not that try jiggling and turning the pots back and forth. You might have a cold solder somewhere. Finally try cleaning all the tube pins and sockets and maybe swapping tubes. Those are the easy to diagnose problems. If its not either of those youre looking at going a little more in depth. And if youre not comfortable doing so better take it to someone.

If you and the OD on top of the distortion channel of the amp it could boost you for a solo or depending on some pedals like my Fulltone OCD it could really smooth out the tone and give you this really sweet shimmering higher gain sound.Some amps dont have a distortion channel or not that great of one so theyll use the OD pedal to add a little break up.

471954,0,t3_1zi224,I feel your pain man! About a year and a half ago I had surgery in the back topside of my frettinghand wrist for the removal of a ganglion cyst benign cyst. I was pretty scared that I wouldnt be able to play again. I was off the instrument for probably about  or  weeks completely and after that it was very slow. Certain chords were impossible and my hand tired easily. My entire forearm was massively swollen and throbbing with pain .Thankfully that all healed up nicely. Then about  months ago I had an accident at work and shanked myself in the same damn wrist on the underside this time with a piece of steel. Lets just say that sharp steel vs. skin is basically the same as a hot knife through butter. Blood geyser! NSFL  I have permanent nerve damage now. My fretting hand ring finger is almost completely numb to touch and half of my palm is completely numb. Strangely I still get hotcold sensation but thats about it.Ive been learning to work around it. I remember when I first started playing again after the accident my ring finger was effectively fucked. Kept missing strings hitting the wrong one or just flying off the fretboard entirely. Ive been playing for going on  years now so this was insanely frustrating for me. Reminded me of the kind of crap I dealt with when I had been at it for only a few months. Fingers disobeying me! Its still not perfect but Ive got it mostly back to normal.Thankfully my muscle memory is so strong that for most things I dont even have to think about whether or not what Im doing is right because my hand just knows how to move properly already. But Im missing that tactile feedback. I cant feel the strings under my ring finger or anything and I cant really tell how hard Im pressing down either.Ive had to doubleup on my practice time to make myself stronger now but its worked. Im pretty much back to where I was preinjury and presurgery. Bottom line is you can pretty much overcome anything barring your hand gets totally chopped off. At that point I would just say go to a new instrument. The reason humans still exist is because of their tenacious spirit and refusal to be beaten. So do the work hit the woodshed and you will likely come out as a better player.Just remember this is gonna take time! I strongly recommend going for physiotherapy  times per week for as long as you can afford once the wound closes up. If you neglect this you might shortchange yourself on healing opportunities.,Guitar,cftwwdt,2,t5_2qi79

Holy fuck its heavy.A cool amp I played today for the first time was the ENGL Thunderbolt  and that was pretty fucking cool compared to a shitty HiWatt and a Vypyr . Could be worth a look too. Shared EQ though but you wont buy it for cleans. I really enjoyed this BTW. Hooooooly shiiiiit. Both of them should do the job. All power equates to is mostly clean headroom ie how much before the amp breaks up. Get something with a master volume though. In all honesty though apartments gonna piss a lot of people off so Id even suggest not going valve and getting a Peavey Vypyr Tube whatever their latest series update is with a valve poweramp out of the loop ,Guitar,cfxfqqb,1,t5_2qi79

538646,0,t3_20aelh,Jerkstore has already given you good advice on learning basic theory and training your ear so Ill just give you some advice about technique.Strengthen your left hand first and improve your picking hand slowly as you go along with lefthand strengthening exercises. Left hand should comes first. Paul Gilbert gave a good analogy on this you gotta learn to control the steering wheel left hand before you hit the  gas right handA good way to do this would be when you practice scales or the wellknown  exercises try to pick one note in each string and hammeron and pulloff all the other notes. Do this slowly and get it perfect first then try it faster. Your left hand will start hurting so make sure to take breaks and let it rest before you start over again.,Guitar,cg1i1ev,1,t5_2qi79

But it looks like youre not giving yourself enough time to position your fingers properly for bends for example. Im noticing that at the end of some of your bends your fingers are really flat on the fretboard they should be curled more so you can really grip the string. And that applies to vibrato too. I think you should just slow down and try to keep your hand rounder so you can really use your fingertips to grab the string and hang on to it tight,Guitar,cg4eu4v,3,t5_2qi79

587323,0,t3_20up72,The one GC by me used to be horrible. I only make it out there maybe  times a year. Anyways I walked in one day stocked up on some strings and then asked an employee if I could play one of the LPs they had at the top of the wall. Guy asked me at least  times if I was going to buy it to which I answered how can I buy a guitar that costs as much as a used car if I cant even play it. The employee then says hell come back with the step ladder and get it for me. minutes later they guy comes back and asks if Im buying the guitar to which I give the same response. He then proceeds to stand at the register ten feet from me and acts like Im not there. I then politely asked him WTF and he said I cant play it unless I buy it.In the end I emailed a nasty letter to GC to which the store manager said hed hook me up with some discounts if I was ever back there again.

I looked at your gear list and I noticed a stark contrast between the quality of your guitars and the quality of your amp. Leave your guitars alone. Changing the pickups will do nothing to change the sound if its coming out of your current amp.Your fundamental problem is the amp and that abomination of a pedal the Metal Zone but Ill get onto that in a second. Some will disagree with me but the vast majority of your sound comes from the amp. An  watt solid state Peavey is NOT suitable for home use.What I would recommend is a lowwattage tube amp which will sound good without breaking your ears. Look at Blackstar Hughes And Kettner Orange Jet City ENGL and the like.For example The ENGL Gigmaster  is a little  watt amp that comes with the option to bump it down to as low as W. Some Orange amps have a similar feature as do a couple of HampKs. Blackstar have made a lovely amp in the HT and theyve got the HT Metal out now as well.Go shopping. Browse. Set a budget and find somewhere that will let you play with them.And get rid of that Metal Zone. Soak it in gasoline and light a match.

I like to think of it as a chink in my armor that I need to fix though. honestly some of these things like a bar chords or the dreaded F chord fall into this weird ambiguous category where you kind of just have to keep practicing it and faking it until you eventually develop the finger strength and dexterity to do it. other than that you really need to be more consistent with your playing. even if you practice only for  or  minutes a day its usually a lot better than practicing for  hour bursts every  weeks. the more consistent you are then the more information and muscle memory you retain.,Guitar,cgmcm24,2,t5_2qi79

When you do something you like file it away. Listen to a progression that you are going to jam over and singhum some melody lines over it. Do this a lot.

A lot of the time when I get this question the student isnt even really aware of the guitar or what its doing in the recording theyre so focused on the melody and vocals.  This is a hard habit to break them out of but try clapping the rhythm and getting them to join in without the guitar just to get them listening.  If listening isnt a problem simplify the rhythm for them.  Get them strumming on the beat even if the song doesnt then on every eighth note the offbeat etc.  The more they can hear the chords in relation to the rhythm the more theyll be able to discern what theyre doing right and wrong.  Start getting them to drop beats but make them keep their arm moving ie. strum on   and  skip over  this helps them to internalize the beat and eventually allow them to strum whenever they want or need to.,Guitar,ch0to9e,1,t5_2qi79

862065,0,t3_23z3wu,The best approach IMO is a combination of ear training transcribing and fretboardtheory exercises.  Youve already got the fretboard stuff in place but in order to get the most out need to really work on your ear.  Practice without the guitar this site has some good exercises and with time you should able to hear distinct qualities of each interval.  You may not be able to explain the difference between a perfect th and a perfect th but you just know its like remembering someones face.The next step is to work out recorded music by ear.  Take things phrase by phrase and practice retaining the sound in shortterm memory before going to play it.  Imagine the task of transcribing an article you read online with a pen and paper.  Youre less likely to make a mistake if you repeat each sentence it your head a few times before writing.  Same thing with music except instead of words you need to remember rhythm pitch and dynamics.  The more you do this the better.  I would get into the habit of repeating and learning most everything you hear whenever possible.        This mindset naturally carries over to the guitar.  When youre challenging your ear on regular basis its going to effect you how you listen to your own playing.  In addition to explicit knowledge and better technique those long exhaustive fretboard exercises will lead to stronger unconscious associations between the sounds you hear and the neck of the guitar.  This means that you hear a certain note interval or chord and your hands will instinctively find the right place maybe within a couple of frets on the guitar usually before youre able use your theory to name it.This last part was what was missing from my playing for the longest time.  I studied all kinds of shapes and patterns but I always felt tone deaf.  For me the problem wasnt so much that I couldnt play what was in head it was that the music in my head was never really wellformed to begin with.  I would take my ideas anemic as they were and try to plug them in to my pet shapes like a sort of formula but that never really worked.,Guitar,ch29t7l,2,t5_2qi79

876296,0,t1_ch3pd02,Thats a tricky question not sure I am able to answer it. Sometimes I find the most inspiration from simply taking a short leave from guitar. Usually it is not more than  days. This is kind of guitar specific advice in a way though.I also find that ensuring you have adequate and varied stimulation in the rest of your life provides a good template from which to draw musical inspiration. If all you ever do is woodshed it on your axe ha! you will have no real life experiences to make music about. This applies to instrumental music as much as it does to music with lyrics. Woodshedding it can only take you so far right? Its good for chops not for actual creation of music. Music is primarily about relating the life experience or possibly about escaping it for a short while which in a way is still a kind of relation.Personally I try to keep my life pretty wholesome whatever the fuck that means in that I dont watch any TV listen to the radio and I very rarely watch movies and even then I feel somewhat hesitant about doing so. I spend most of my waking hours working learning gardening playing guitar socializing or just sitting. Mainstream media is brainwashing fluff and there is essentially nothing good about it but that is another can of worms. ,Guitar,ch3w06g,1,t5_2qi79

A cheap tube amp will likely come with terrible tubes unless it was used. Retubing W amp with even decent tubes is going to double your budget. Go SS for now and save up. ,Guitar,ch47znl,1,t5_2qi79

880291,0,t1_ch4bnap,Disagree with you about there being nothing wrong with quarter inch jacks.  They have a lot of connectivity issues as any amp tech or just general guitar player could tell you.  They often dont properly connect causing the user to have to twist the cord around until it touches and works.  There  are also a lot of issues with noise and feedback when the connectors arent perfect.  I feel like these problems would be easily fixed by updating the cords used for guitars amps and pedals. ,Guitar,ch4cc6n,-2,t5_2qi79

Also I like to wind my strings multiple times lower on the post to avoid the holes if I am planning to change tunings a bit. I hope this helps.

The world would be a better place with another badass slide player.To answer your question for me it was before girls. I grew up in a nonmusical home. I loved Johnny Cash and John Denver so I begged for a guitar. I got a beater classical and some crap lessons so it went on the back burner. Then More Than a Feeling then Eruption. Picked up the beater and did the best I could until I could get an electric.

930119,0,t1_ch9x4v7,gtPeople not being upfront about their intentions. Wanna quit?Oh my god this. I played in a pop cover band and we had this singer that just had zero interest. We were already established as a band but our previous singer was having a kid so she had to bow out. The new singer that came in was really good. Voice major in college big ideas for her future but just zero motivation at all times and it really showed on stage. She was a dead fish. Eventually it came out that she just hates the music and venues we played so she wasnt motivated to perform well. It was top s covers at shitty suburban bars. None of us really liked it we did it because it was a paying gig but she joined knowing what the material was and her shitty performance wasnt making any good impressions kind of necessary to get some better bar gigs. She brought her dadmanager down to rehearsal one night to discuss what changes we could make to keep her happy and at that point we decided it wasnt worth continuing with this shit. gtit was like they thought we should be the most popular band in town without playing any shows or making any connections.Spent the last few months having this argument with some of my bandmates too. gt Also leaving shows right after were done playing instead of staying to watch the rest of the show.This bugs the hell out of me. I used to do it when I was younger being under drinking age and at a bar kind of blows so I would pack it in but you really miss out on any opportunity to make connections with other bands and see something outside of what youre doing. My current main gigging band has stepped it up a bit with this. We try to make friends. Its a music community first and foremost. If you want to make it anywhere you need to network. Helps you get gigs in the long run if you find bands that have a similarcomplementary sound you can build better shows with more audience overlap and pick up new fans etc etc. Every once in a while maybe. But your whole band loads right off stage and into the van then bolts on the rest of the show? Its pretty obvious to everyone else there you dont give a shit about anyone but yourself. I think the worst example of this was this one show I played where two of my bands were on the bill. Two of the members of my main band couldnt be bothered to come down and watch my other bands set. Pissed me off to no end. Just a straight up douche bag move and I know it was really driven by one of them because he can be quite a selfish prick from time to time. But still. Really pissed me off. ,Guitar,cha0c17,10,t5_2qi79

Put in the work practicing at home and show up ready to play the playlist.Jam sessions are jam sessions where you interact with the other players and work on making some new music.  This is where you bring along your songs and present them to the rest of the band.  Work on parts with them... dont dictate who should play what work with them.  This is where everyone gets to be creative including the drummer    And where everyone should have input.And try and record everything you do... rehearsals and jams.  Its so easy and cheap nowadays to do this.  And its valuable to be able to come back and hear what everyone is doing wrong and what theyre doing right.

Just so you dont have to go trolling the web for this stuff heres some more info on parts because I happen to have all of this stuff bookmarked anywaysLike I mentioned in another comment with those guitars the pickups are usually mounted in the pickguard. These models if the one on reverb is anything to go by have gold foils in them. Lollar makes a good one apparently but tbh there are other builders who can make one just as good but it doesnt have the same Ry Cooder pickup cover. If you wanted to go vintage but not precisely accurate but still Japanese you can always search ebay for loaded Teisco or Norma pickguards. The only one up right now is this one which I think would look pretty flashy but youd have to fill in some spots in the exposed body cavity which might look pretty weird given the guitars finish.

1000981,0,t1_chi154r,I really felt that this was a subject one was either aware or oblivious to. I always felt that this was pretty common knowledge in the guitar world that bone was better for tonal qualities than plastic. I have spent hundreds of dollars and countless hours changing saddle and nut materials on my own instruments to try and find what I like in sound. Ive tried ivory tusq nubone mother of pearl brass plastic plexiglass rosewood ebony unbleached cattle bone bleached cattle bone water Buffalo bone buffalo horn maple fossil ivory there might be more on the list. Each material produced different sound some were very similar and others not at all. Rosewood and rock maple were more similar than ebony and rosewood. So when someone tells me I cant tell a difference in sound between materials it really pushes me to try and convince them otherwise.I feel the test in your video was very poorly done based on the way the guitar was amplified. Also I feel the individual performing the test is a novice guitar tech at best due to his description. However this is a great example for the format of the test that I am proposing.

So its not a bad idea to go the software route that way you can record your stuff have a large variety of different sounds you can get potentially solve your issues if its not the cable and be able to get a high gain sound playing through a nice set of headphones enabling you to continue an amicable relationship with those in your immediate vicinity.,Guitar,chispu5,1,t5_2qi79

It doesnt really matter which. Ive seen a lot of post rock bands use Teles and Jazzmasters but you can really use anything.Next you need an amp that has great cleans and handles pedals.Then you need a big reverb a longish digital delay and whatever other effects you want. the reverbdelay combination is most important. for This Will Destroy You you probably want some type of drive but you can use whatever you want.

I dont really play  string guitars so I dont know how it compares to others but it looks gorgeous and was pretty easy to play and had some amazing ring and sustain. They play incredibly well for relatively low priced guitars. My only complaint is that the stock electronics are kinda cheap and a little noisy.

1182514,0,t3_27nbz6,No. Thats like saying learning proper brushstrokes hinders your ability to create good paintings. You know how there are times you want to draw something but the paper never looks like what was in your head? Thats because you didnt have to proper knowledge to recreate what your mind gave you. Same for music theory. If you come up with a melody or sound in your head reproducing it will be much easier when you know the mechanics behind what your mind imagined. The reason it seems like the technically knowledgable people seem to be the least creative is because a lot of technical masters never learn how to use the knowledge musically. Anyone can practice a scale for weeks in order to play it really fast but not everyone is able to make it sound pleasing or interesting. Thats where the problem lies. Look up Dave Weiner hes an instrumental guitarist that teaches in weekly videos called riff of the week. It used to be a free series on youtube but now its a subscription service.

Its not a competition and most other buskers are friendly and talkative otherwise they probably wouldnt be playing out in public.Story TimeAfter playing a show with my band at a park on Canada Day me and another friend that I usually go busking with decided to go elsewhere at the park and busk.

You also have the option of crafting tone digitally on the computer. A lot of people will tell you the sound isnt as authentic though.You will also need a digital audio workstation DAW. Reaper is popular around here. Higher end DAWs include fruity loops and ableton. I use mixcraft. Hopefully your DAW will recognize your digital audio interface and you should be good to go.As you record you can videotape yourself and layer your final recording over the video to produce one like the example you gave.Good luck.,Guitar,ci4zkts,2,t5_2qi79

1259345,0,t3_28iinh,Well its hard to say exactly where youre at but from my experience I always wished I would have practiced to a metronome. I honestly think this is one of the most important things to do as my style now is based on the fact that I learned rhythm and timing as a sort of secondary fundamental. I started out in a much more metal mindset too and quickly learned that my low e string chugging sounded much sloppier than my friends who were more diligent in their practicing. Rhythm and tightness make a metal guitar player extremely sought after. Beyond that I know it sounds boring but scales man. Yeah YouTube videos are great but I always found I was able to develop my sound and style more by getting comfortable with a scale and then coming up with my own ways to travel through it without the aid of anyone else.

Before the show. You know in practice. By the day of the show you probably know whether or not youve practiced enough.Also I would recommend not drinking beforehand.

1288506,0,t1_ciej8ss,I think Gary Clark Jr. and Dan Auerbach have a lot of similar influences but from listening to Gary since the early s and to the Black Keys since maybe  I dont hear Dan in Gary or Gary in Dan. Instead I hear a lot of Buddy Guy John Lee Hooker Freddy King etc. in both of them. To me I feel it when I listen to Gary more than when I listen to the Black Keys. I just dont get that blues feeling in my gut with The Black Keys. Dont get me wrong Dan is probably a good guy and I definitely respect his work it just doesnt strike a chord with me and I know im vastly in the minority in my opinion. In terms of hearing similarities with Bright Lights and other Black Keys songs maybe Your Touch for example I think if Dan were to play Bright Lights it would come out quite different. IMO Dan would favor a more fast paced riff without the layering of the second guitar. Bright Lights hits me with that bend on the first lick over the chord progression right before the first verse. I dont think Dan would have played it this way. Not that he couldnt its just not his style. I think Numb might be even easier to see the similar influences but still the differences are present. Gary slows down the tempo in the verses and really emphasises the downbeat. Dan keys off the beat but travels more in his riffs. Personally I feel the raw emotion more in Gary than in Dan. Still though theyre both great guitarists. Its like comparing Jimmy Page and Keith Richards. Both have very similar influences and are blues guitarists at heart. Personally I like Led Zeppelin and Jimmy Page more than The Stones but there are a lot of Stones fans out there and Ill never try to make an argument that Keith Richards isnt a great guitarist.,Guitar,cieknpi,3,t5_2qi79

1352377,0,t3_29kn2l,All right check it out.Lets take the C major scale                 C D E F G A B         Next lets take the diatonic pattern for a major key    Major minor minor Major Major minor diminishedApplying the diatonic pattern to the key gives us the following    C major  D minor  E minor  F major  G major  A minor  B diminishedIf we take each of these triads Root third amp fifth intervals well have the following    C major C  E  G    D minor D  F  A    E minor E  G  B    F major F  A  C    G major G  B  D    A minor A  C  E    B diminished B  D  FNotice anything? Each triad in the diatonic pattern contains notes from the C major scale. Therefore each of these triads are said to be in key. As a result you can play the C major scale over the entire progression and you will end up sounding okay because regardless of which chord in the progression you are playing over the notes match.If you were to play the G major scale whenever it switches to the G chord it would sound okay but would sound different if you stayed in G and played over the other chords in the scale. The G major scale is dominant over the C major scale because in the key of C major G is the fifth degree. If you look on the fretboard youll notice that each interval in the G major scale is a perfect fifth above the same interval in the C major scale.You can use any scale that uses the same tones as the C major scale to solo over a C major chord progression. These include the C major scale and the A minor scale along with other scales.,Guitar,cilt8lo,14,t5_2qi79

1437689,0,t1_ciwgrvf,Look down the neck to make sure it isnt bowed in or out too much  a little bend toward the front is okay.Make sure the truss rod works both rquire a mm hexallen wrench. You dont have to crank on it just feel if it catches and there is tension there and that its not stuck in place either. If there is no tension on the adjusting nut  do not buy the guitar. You wont be able to fix it when the neck does bend from climate changes and aging.Check for strings buzzing close to the body while playing open strings and chords on the lower frets. This could be a sign of the dreaded acoustic neck hump where the neck is jointed to the body. It can be fixed but its a pain in the ass.Look at the back of the guitar. It should be flat but a slight overall outward bulge is okay. If it looks pregnant do not buy it.Look on the front  if the bridge is pulling itself up off the body its a nogo. If the front is caving in between the soundhole and the bridge its a nogo.And most obviously  feel the string action. It should be a comfortable amount off the fretboard but not too high. This can be easily fixed IF all of the other things Ive listed check out its a simple sanding of the saddle and a neck adjustment.Armed with this knowledge youll never buy an abused or poorly made guitar.

There are exceptions  everyone seems to like drawing before theyre good at it and programming seems to be similar  but its very common to feel this way.  In my case giving myself a definite goal  LEARN THIS ONE SONG ALL THE WAY THROUGH  made all the difference.  I went from hating practice and basically ignoring the guitar for ten years because every time I picked it up to mess around I felt guilty about not doing the exercises the tutor gave me to loving it and running to pick up the guitar when I get home from work.  So you should try that  pick a song you really like and just work on it from beginning to end.  Play that first measure slowly until you can play it quickly.  Move on when youve got it down.  Im still trying to make my way through the Goliath Guitar fingerstyle arrangement of Let It Go  that chorus is a killer and Im considering switching to an easier arrangement for now and coming back to that one later  but  in just a few weeks of working through the intro first verse and bridge I can see so much improvement in my playing overall.

They are blemished broken etc. and I doubt the pictures were strategically taken to avoid showing the crack since they place all bodies in the same position for picture taking. You dont buy bodies from the factory buyout section unless youre expecting that. You buy them from the necks and bodies section.And its not like people in this sub havent paid  for a Gibson that was complete shut. What did they do? Continue playing Gibson. You lost  one time.

I lusted after it seeing it in my local shop caused me confused feelings that took me weeks to get over. But once I got it I loved it. There is one downside. Those INF pickups are absolute garbage. They can sound good but it is a shame that they are installed in such a beautiful guitar. Mine also had the zr bridge and I wish it would have come with the Gibraltar. I ended up selling mine for an s about a year after buying it and was much happier overall with the instrument. The neck binding on those s are a little shoddy some times and can have some sharp edges but otherwise are they are a dream to play. Seriously so fluid. I would recommend that you look at this bubinga top instead of poplar and dimarzio pickups. Ive had one for about  months now and ended up selling my s because I never played it.

1514736,0,t1_cj5fp8p,PERFECT example of how tone is entirely dependent on context.  I bet if you put that guitar track up by itself everyone would cringe but in the context of the song its fucking magic.  This is why I always get frustrated with people chasing great tone in their bedroom by themselves.  Get the fuck out there man!  Put in context!  Im happy that youve got the money to spend impressing yourself but youre going to sound WAY better once you know what a guitar is supposed to sound like  an ensemble instrument.  Intros and such are fine but the only time that thing is really doing its job is when its sitting in the comfy hands of the rhythm section.  ,Guitar,cj65dbg,1,t5_2qi79

1530908,0,t3_2br81x,Here are some that I have found particularly helpful in no particular order The Guitar Handbook by Ralph Denyer great generalreference on the history of guitars the concepts of playing technique and musictheory guitar repairs and maintenance biographies and descriptions of important guitarplayers and their styles and beautifully illustrated with photographs and diagrams. A useful and inspiring reference for beginners and veterans alike.  The Heavy Guitar Bible A Rock Guitar Instruction Manual by Rich Daniels. Rich Daniels has a whole series of remarkable books focused heavily on practical how to play like the guitar gods techniques. This extraordinary laborof love is handillustrated like an old illuminated manuscript and heavily geared towards the bluesbased protometal sounds of classic rock and is designed to get you playing quickly starting with basic blockchords boxscales and simple riffs and then gradually adding complexity and speedtechnique. A lot of musicteachers and classicaljazz types will be aghast at some of his approaches but the selftaught garageband types will find a process to learning that focuses on breaking music down into  fretboard patternsshapes and pickingfingering licks n tricks that increase gradually in difficulty and complexity. The net result is an approach designed to continuously improve your playing right now by taking whatever you already know and adding a couple of new tricks to your bag. Useful for just about any skill level but primarily within the confines of rock lead guitar and an approach focused on gradually adding and combining licks techniques and chordsboxscales of greater speed difficulty and complexity.  Any decent Fake Book skip the Real Book series unlessuntil you get deep into jazz. A Fake Book is a book of songs that breaks things down into the most basic elements. Typically there is a melodyline showing the notes the singer should sing lyrics and chord namessymbols and thats it. Its what is left of a song when you strip away all the flashy production money licks string swells funky bass loops... to sit down with a fake book and a piano or a guitar is to have the essential songwriting structure of hundreds or thousands of hit songs laid out in front of you in the simplest terms possible. I believe its also one of the the best and easiest ways for selftaught popmusicians to start learning how to read music because you can learn as a child learns you know the melody but not perfectly you see it written right there under the lyrics and you start connecting the dots to figure out how to play it. Yes guitar players should be playing the vocal melodies its amazing what you can learn from singers.  Pick at least one album and buy the authorized tab book for it and learn it notefor note all the way through. Be aware that the album you pick will have a huge and lifelong effect on your playing and approach. Even if you learn to play hundreds of other albums notefornote some part for your approach will always be in reference to the first style and set of songs you really learned and internalized. So choose wisely.Here are some nonguitar specific references I also recommend If you are at all interested in filmscoring orchestral composition or  classical approaches to theory voiceleading and harmony Principles of Orchestration by RimskyKorsakov. There is actually a brilliant interactive version of it online for free which I highly recommend  The online version lets you hear the music examples while following an animated score which is a huge advantage for anyone whose sightreading may be weak andor who doesnt have access to recordings of the reference material. This is How to write for Orchestra for Dummies except its just as helpful for geniuses. Following the book alone will require a piano and the ability to read music accurately andor copies of all the recordings and an ability to at least follow a written score. But the online version is quite usable even if you can barely read music. Some basic understanding of scales and intervals is required.  If youre into jazz and want to get deep into jazz like so deep that you may never come out again The Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization by George Russell is a kind of semimythical Necronomicon among jazzheads commonly known as the concept among the kind of people who stay up until dawn talking about jazztheory especially among people who refuse to call it jazz. You dont strictly need to be able to sightread music but you should at least be able to name the notes on the staff and translate them to your instrument of choice. You should also have some understanding of how scales modes and chords interact. Its not a level book but it can be surprisingly accessible for something that dives so deep.  Hooktheory Vol  is an extraordinary interactive ebook focusing on popmusic theory. Ive never seen anything like it and its been needed for a long time. No musicreading ability is required since it doesnt use sheet music but instead midistyle colored charts to dissect chords and melody. The musical examples used are things like Bruno Mars Green Day Kelly Clarkson Matchbox  Pink Rihanna The Beatles The Four Seasons The Killers Tom Petty... this is a musictheory book dedicated specifically to deconstructing radiohits written by PhDs but its actually quite useful to anyone. A downside is that this  volume one is really more like chapter one. You can read it in an afternoon and it does not cover for example songs written in a minor key what the authors call using the vi as home base promised in a forthcoming second volume which I am very excited for. This is kind of the inverse of Heavy Guitar Bible there are no licks n tricks this is pure theory but it has a similar kind of spectrum of usefulness from beginner to old pro. That said I think it is helpful to come into with some familiarityunderstanding of scales and intervals. The book covers the basics but it does so quickly. It really seems geared towards people who know something about scales and chords but want to know how to put them together. For a beginnerfriendly approach it dives remarkably deep into things like chordsubstitutions and melodic counterpoint. It also reveals some of the surprisingly clever musicality underlying a lot of manufactured pop hits. ,Guitar,cj86co8,11,t5_2qi79

1546685,0,t3_2bybza,If you want to learn scales learn the pentatonic scale and the major scale. A scale is just a group of notes a group of intervals from a given key note for the most part. If you search  google images for guitar fretboard notes youll see a picture where all the natural notes  c d e f g a b are highlighted. These notes also happen to make up the C major scale though the patterns for major scales are all the same. In order to play in C major you can play any of those notes. Which notes you choose are up to you. But you use those notes as sort of a guide to stick to but you mix them up creatively as you wish. Its like in a coloring book how you only draw between the lines but what you draw is up to you. However if someone just showed you the notes of the C major scale and told you to just play those notes youd probably be lost. So in order to learn the scale the fretboard is broken down into chunks to be learned individually. Then you learn to move between the chunks. In order to change key you just shift the patterns up or down. The pentatonic scale is typically broken into five chunks patterns. Diatonic scales the major scale and the modes of the major scale including the minor scale are typically either broken up into the  position  patterns to memorize CAGED system or the  position notesperstring system. I recommend the latter though its up to you. Also if you learn the shapes of the minor pentatonic scale and the major scale youve automatically learned the shapes for the major pentatonic scale and the shapes of the diatonic modes. The shapes are exactly the same its just a matter of how to apply them and what chords to play them over. Also playing up and down the scale is important in order to memorize the scale but you should also be trying to hear how each note each interval sounds within the scale. Each interval has a different sound and working on hearing them is important. ,Guitar,cja5fkf,1,t5_2qi79

1604638,0,t3_2cnwnm,What youre actually doing when you play a harmonic is you are causing the string to vibrate in more than one place.  Instead of one long arc you will have two arcs three four etc.  The harmonic on the th fret for example causes the string to vibrate exactly in half.  Film it and slow it down and you would see an arc between the th fret and the bridge and an arc between the th fret and the nut.  A harmonic on the th fret divides the string in three parts between the nut and the th fret the th and the th fret and the th and the bridge.  You can prove this by playing the harmonic at the th fret it will sound the same as the th fret harmonic.The best way to execute a harmonic is with something very hard insert joke here.  Your best option is a good hard part of your callous which if youre just starting out you may not have enough yet.  You want the tiniest amount of hard finger tip touching the string exactly over the fret and then quickly lifting your finger immediately after plucking.  The longer it stays on the more dead the harmonic will be.  It really just takes practice to get the feel right start with the th fret harmonics they are the easiest ones to do and work out from there.  ,Guitar,cjhflbk,3,t5_2qi79

Most beginners tend to do that since visual representation is a crutch you can rely on and not have to actually study music properly. You cant just drive a straight line down a string going ok whole step half step whole step etc and expect to get music out of that just like you cant expect to go ok my box starts on fret  ends on fret  and expect it to sound like anything besides an exercise.Play what sounds good to you without thinking of drawings you saw in a book or on a webpage. THEN try and figure out WHY what you just played sounded good. Played a D over a D chord in G minor and it sounded real cool to you? That means that you can always play the flat  over that fifth degree and have it sound the same way. Listen to music you like and figure out why you like it then try and translate that into your playing. Analyze everything youre listening to and everything youre doing when youre improvising. Most people take years to develop an even moderate ability to improvise. You cant expect to be able to do it overnight just because you scratched the very surface of scales and chord progressions.,Guitar,cjonwoo,16,t5_2qi79

1696554,0,t3_2dtkzi,I suggest you build something with a multicore processor at least an Intel i with PLENTY of RAM GB will be more than enough and PLENTY of storage TB or TB if youre particularly active. Make sure that your hard drives run at at least RPM so it gets saved quickly. Get some high quality sound monitor speakers or headphones NOT regular speakersheadphones. These will give you an idea of what your music truly sound like without any of the equalisation added by most conventional recreational headphones.An external sound card otherwise known as an audio interface is the best option for hardware. There are two types USB and FirewireThunderbolt. USB is the cheaper option. It works by converting your input signals into packets of data and sending them to the computer where they are unpacked. This is better if you are only using one or two inputs and dont mind a little bit of latency at very unpractically high quality. Look at the Steinberg UR series and the Focusrite Scarlett Series. Although the cheapest Steinberg UR has midi for keys and control The Scarlett i is the cheapest Focusrite option for midi input.The other option is firewirethunderbolt. Firewire basically sends the data directly to the computer so there is less latency. However it wont make a difference if youre using only a few inputs. If you happen to be micing up a full drumkit or recording a bands live performance then this is the way to go. Thunderbolt is a new type of connector that works in the same way as firewire so there are adaptors available. Theyre mainly on Apple computers but there are some expensive PC motherboards with thunderbolt connectors. If you want to use firewire you may have to get a separate firewire card. The Focusrite Saffire Pro series comes to mind as a good line of firewirethunderbolt interfaces. AFAIK all of them have some form of midi input for keys and control.For software almost all interfaces will come with a basic copy of a DAW. Focusrite tends to bundle Ableton Live my preference while Steinberg will bundle their own Cubase simply brilliant as well. You can buy upgrade codes for these but for hobbyistmedium use these are perfect. The full versions of Cubase  and Ableton Live  are great in their own right.Reaper as others have said is also brilliant especially as it is basically free. It is a  day trial but it is  days of you actually using the program so unless you leave it open for  days straight then itll last you a while and even then it only costs a reasonable amount to upgrade it.For plugins I use Amplitube and Guitar Rig . Both have a dizzying array of amps effects cabinets and other things.

Both are technically proficient players that can shred but one sounds like a robot and one sounds like a human being with soul.Id say one in every hundred guitar players is an actual musician. In the sense that their playing is very lyrical and pleasing to listen to because it is unique in some way. These are the people who can effortlessly write good music that resonates with non musicians. There are thousands of technically proficient guitarists who know loads of theory and can play anything but arent very good musicians. of the most well known and influential guitarists of the last  years at least in the genres of bluesrock  are basically self taught and know very basic theory if any at all.

Take the chords that youre playing over and figure out which notes sound good over them. Start with the root rd and th. Just create riffs with those notes. Then introduce more notes and passing tones. This is just personal experience but I feel a lot more freedom in my playing when I think in terms of chords and not scales.

Like a flamenco version of scar tissue or a metal take on September by earth wind and fire. That might be fun. Alternately I was reading through your original post and thought it might be cool if when you guys get the three songs chosen stop there and no vote and give everybody three songs to choose from.

Id almost say if you really want to cover that range of tones your best bet is to save for a Mark V. Youre in a bit of a tight spot since youre looking for a range of tones that would normally require multiple amps. As for wattage. Keep in mind that wattage  headroom not volume. Low wattage amps give you powertube breakup at much lower volumes which would be great for blues amp classic rock tones but absolutely horrible for anything in which you needed a tight focused sound. Also the volume knob exist for a reason. Either way dont limit yourself to low wattage. In fact low wattage amps can suck as bedroom amps since most of them are basically designed to be played super loud. Ive owned many low wattage amps and all of them were too loud at their lowest volume to play at home while many of my higher wattage amps worked just fine. ,Guitar,cjxvv72,6,t5_2qi79
1737325,0,t3_2e6xdk,I was all set to go to college for something practical like accounting but that all changed when I discovered guitar at . Before that moment nothing held my attention the way music and the guitar did. I knew that if I pursued anything else Id be bored and Id feel a sense of loss. Im also wired in such a way that I dont want to feel regret or guilt. That being said I ditched the practical career path practiced auditioned and was accepted into a state school in Pennsylvania that has a music department with a good reputation. Studying music at the collegiate level is definitely information overload but thats the best part! I learned so much about classical guitar theory history jazz etc. Practicing guitar was  of my homework and that was amazing. There is a lot to consider but if your intuition overrides your doubt you should go for it. You cant just assume youll get by on performing alone. Im currently a Masters student and Ive been in school for quite a few years. It seems like the faculty are now just stressing the importance of being entrepreneurial. The more skills you have the more marketable youll be. Im not just talking about those guitar skills either. If you absolutely need to be around music and want to have some stable income theres music education music therapy music business sound engineering etc. Teaching lessons could go either way. It depends where you live and how well you advertise. Im currently in that category trying to build up a private studio. Students definitely come and go and yes you may have all this knowledge and youre sitting there teaching some basic chords. Thankfully I havent had to work a nonmusic job in a few years but you never know. If it happens that becomes the side gig to what I really care about. I apologize if my post was all over the place but I think you already know the answer to your question. If you have an open mind and its something you want to the point of nothing getting in your way Im sure youll find success. One book to check out is The Savvy Musician by Dr. David Cutler.

Particularly contemporary jazz theory which deals a lot with improvisation harmonic functions and understanding the major scale. Knowing why the things you are playing sound the way they do and conjure the emotions they do is a huge help in all aspects of music but will definitely help you make on the fly decisions when soloing. Understanding what scales can be played over what chord progressions and what notes stay in the key you are playing will help a lot in any lead part. And understanding how each degree of a scale resolves will help in deciding where to go next in your melodies. Learning theory will help you. If you learn it right and understand the concepts you will have a much easier time soloing and your riffs will probably sound a lot less repetitive andor boring.,Guitar,ck1kogg,2,t5_2qi79

Ideally youd remove everything but I wasnt confident about getting them back on the exact way they were before... I began on a patch that was already chipped and just used a hairdryer over the area this caused the paint to rise a bit away from the wood. I stuck a blunt knife under the paint trying not to scrape the wood and just started prising it off in chips. Some people use a heat gun and a chisel but I wasnt too worried about being neat the guitar was already quite beat up and I just went with what tools I have. You need to be careful not to leave the hairdryer on too long around the soldering the plastic parts or the neck joint incase things warp or melt!Once it was all off the guitar was still covered in a lot of old glue. I sanded it down using increasingly finer grains. Then gave it a thick coat of TruOil gave that a day to dry wet sanded it a bit and then gave it a few more thinner coats. You can add loads more coats if you want a nice shiny finish but I left mine looking quite natural.I should mention not all guitars have this kind of paint and not all guitars have a nice looking block of wood underneath...

1809174,0,t3_2f9k9h,  If you decide you want a new acoustic make sure you go to the guitar shop talking to the people who work there and let them make recommendations given your budget and the type of tunes you want to learn. The most important thing is that YOU like the way the guitar sounds. I said in an earlier thread dont worry too much about things like action height of the strings relative to the fret board at first just get something youre going to love so much you cant put it down.  Agree w Anon about tuners. Rather than buy one download a smartphone app. and train your ear to recognize when each string is in tune using the tuner as a guide. Too many people never learn to tune a guitar by ear and its important.That being said hard to do that with an electric.  Do you have an amp? Again Anon is right youtube has hundreds of lessons. I HIGHLY recommend searching for a list of beginner songs on the internet deciding which ones you like making a practice schedule even if its in your head that youll stick to and finding the lessons on YouTube. I.e. Im going to learn to play Wild Horses this week. Practice playing along to the actual song so you can really get a grip on rhythm.  When you can mirror the song perfectly move on.  A bad habit to get into is to practice only the things you already know how to do.  Youre going to suck at first and thats totally OK because everyone who has ever picked up a guitar has sucked. NEVER be shy about going into a store and trying to play  if anyone makes you feel shitty about being a beginner than heshe is a douche. Make friends with people in the local shops pick up tips. Music guitar especially should be a community.Best of luck buddy.  Always go for it when youre playing  just let it rip.,Guitar,ck76gk7,1,t5_2qi79

1868175,0,t1_ckeaua0,It was my first acoustic I bought it on sale back before I knew much about the instrument and what i wanted out of one or even really how to play it. i was never  happy with the sound of it tried a bunch of different strings and gauges but could never get it quite the way I wanted it maybe it needed a pro set up or whatever. But still fuck it it was mine and it was my first. I grew to love it  stockholm syndrome if you will. Then I met my wife. She had just been broken up with by her long distance boyf and had bought a Samick Greg Bennet acoustic to fill the time so I suggested she bring it over and I teach her how to play the  chords I knew at the time. Her guitar moved in a year before she did. I seriously love that thing. The annoying thing is I had considered buying it there are only a couple of music shops in my city we had been shopping at the same place because it looked nicer than the Yamaha for the same price and it also had a built in tuner but I had never heard of the brand so went with what I knew. I still have and enjoy the Yamaha itll always have a special place in my heart but he doesnt get played nearly as often. I mainly keep him tuned to drop C to play some slower SOAD songs. Amazing that you can recognise it from a bit of the headstock.

1909384,0,t3_2ggv9x,Really awesome stuff man. If I can add some comments I think some simple editing to keep the pacing up make us not have to wait for you to move things around. Pacing is really important to comedy you have to keep a great flow going or you start to lose people. An idea would be to actually not even focus on teaching music theory focus on making an entertaining video that just happens to teach you tons of stuff about music theory.Ex  Sequelitis teaches concepts of level design while joking about megaman.  YMS teaches concepts of directing amp cinematography but its just a video making fun of a movie.  Jontron teaching all about one game Space Ace while making fun of space ace.I feel like the best way to teach is just sort of aim beside what youre trying to teach and just make that your focus and jokemake things entertaining around it. So you dont feel like youre learning. When you feel like a video is meant to teach you something your brain sort of shuts off in certain ways your no longer being clever to figure things out youre getting someone to tell you something and explain. You dont get any challenge but at the same time you dont want to challenge yourself with a video. You usually want to be entertained. Just things to think about. Good job!,Guitar,ckj9ofh,2,t5_2qi79
1912300,0,t3_2giu7f,First of all  youre really early in the process and being a beginner its going to be that much more difficult for you to evaluate your teacher.  Id hang in there a couple more months and then reevaluate where youre at.  Now to answer your question  a good teacher for you will present the material in a way that is understandable to you  heshe will have an organized plan of attack for how they want you to progress and will be following that lesson plan with you as they teach  and finally will teach a balance of  dealing with the instrument how to holdtunehand positionspickfingerstyle etc  musicfretboard theory reading  both conventional sheet music and tab playing by ear chords and chord structure and single note scales soloing etc.  and all of the above over a broad range of  musical styles.   As a new beginner heshe will not be dumping all those categories of learning on you all at once but they should all be in the mix for your lesson plans for the next year or two  so ask them to explain the big picture to you  where do they want you to be in  months...  months.... a year.... two... etc.    Good teachers have all of that figured out and can very easily tailor it for you vs. some other student based on your personal wantsneeds.   Plan the work and work the plan  otherwise youre just going to be wasting each others time and your money.  Finally  the greatest lesson plan on earth is useless if you dont hit it off.  You have to be able to relate to their teaching style so you get it.  If theres no fit in that department the rest of it wont matter because you wont learn.  Not every good teacher is right for every student  but really good teachers can adjust their approach on the fly to connect with the widest range of students.   Finally  what YOU want matters too.   If I have a student that wants to learn some song  I help them learn that song  and I find ways to work in the theory and all the rest with what makes them happy.  Lesson plans are made to be changed and at the end of the day youll be happier and more willing to practice if you enjoy what youre playing.   Its a marathon not a sprint  theres no reason to be rigid with a student as long as you can cover all the fundamentals some other way.   Hope this helps. ,Guitar,ckjmbvv,1,t5_2qi79

Given the custom color pretty much anything outside of natural and sunburst was considered custom in the s its possible the parts are original and its really a minor thing but Id want to be sure it was stock for the price you paid. ,Guitar,ckov0yt,1,t5_2qi79

1970133,0,t1_ckqjtn4,gt  So the idea is that all of the modes in the same key will have the same notes in them but different modes built on the same root will have different sounds. For instance G Ionian and A Dorian have the same notes in them G A B C D E F the difference is that youll play them both in the same song but over different chords G Major and A Minor respectively. On the other hand G Ionian and G Dorian have very different sets of notes G Dorian is G A Bb C D E F and you would use them over a G major chord in the key of G major or a G minor chord in the key of F major. Again when people say different modes give different sounds they dont mean different modes in the same key but different modes built on the same root.Maybe were saying the same thing but just for clarity if theres a chord progression in G major and you play a G major scale over it you will sound like youre in G major over every chord not just the G chord. Even over an A minor chord it will still sound like G major not A dorian because your ear is still hearing G as the root. The same goes for playing G dorian. If youre playing an F major progression its not going to sound like G dorian but F major even over the G minor chord. Stereotypical major and minor key chord progressions were set up to emphasize the I chord as being the tonal center which is why you dont typically play modes over traditional major and minor key chord progressions aside from major and minor scales. Sometimes in jazz each they a play a different mode over each chord in the chord progression though not A dorian over an A minor chord in a G major progression because that couldnt help but sound like G majorbut if you want to truly be playing modally you wouldnt do that. Modal harmony is static. If you have just an A minor chord playing and you play G major over it it will sound like A dorian. And if you have just and G minor chord playing and you play an F major scale over it it will sound like G dorian. ,Guitar,ckqlo9s,0,t5_2qi79

1973519,0,t3_2h9u29,One factor that will keep this market saturation at bay is the fact that guitarists tend to own more than one guitar and often many more than that. Its quite rare that a household or individual will own more than one piano  at a time if ever.Also guitars are much more portable than pianos. And pianos havent gone away but everybody is playing digital pianos now and those take up much less space than acoustic pianos. And they dont go out of tune.And God forbid if you have a guitar that is too far gone to be salvageable they are much more easy to dispose of.The used market for guitars is great and it will probably continue to be great. You can find just about anything that youre looking for. But there will always be guitarists who insist on owning new guitars.

1993005,0,t1_cktbl72,I think you are moving goal posts around depending on who we are talking about here.  I dont know if I would call Clapton the pioneer of the blues rock movement he may have been the first to happen to make it big doing blues infused rock in the UK but he was followed very quickly by others who were heading down the same path anyway.  Think about it Claptons big break was The Yardbirds he was doing pretty traditional straight electric blues in that band very much in the style of guys like Buddy Guy had Jeff Beck gotten their first instead of shortly after he left it would have been Jeff Beck who pioneered blues rock.  To put it simply there was a entire generation of guitarists in the UK that were all heading to the same place in the s they were heavily influenced by older American blues guitarists and wanted to bring that stuff to the UK.  Heck even David Gilmour started as a straight up blues guitarist had he started now he would get called generic out of hand by this subreddit and guitarists in general.  Mayer has not be around too long when you compare him to the greats like Clapton SRV or Gilmour his guitar playing has not really been out there long enough to really stand the test of time like Claptons work in Cream or Gilmours work in Pink Floyd.   I suspect that there will be a time in the future where guitarists reference Mayers work in the same way that we reference Claptons work now only time can really say who is going to be great all we have is our personal opinions right now.  For the record I am a huge Clapton fan I like everything he has done yes even the stuff that others dont and to be honest I still dont think he was really innovative he did some amazing things but others in his generation were going to do those things anyway Beck Page Hendrix etc.  Finally I gotta say he did make a name for himself by being a virtuoso on guitar just not in the way that guitar magazines and young guitarists go crazy about his acoustic playing in his first couple of albums were pretty amazing if you actually take the time to listen to it some of that stuff was well outside what just about anyone had really heard in that genre before.  ,Guitar,cktcvpr,1,t5_2qi79

2033250,0,t3_2i251e,Yeah people do pick that way Im sure you can find some real good players that do as well but theyll probably be the minority.If youre getting tired then it definitely sounds like you are anchoring.  That its plant the pinky and gently pushing into the guitar body with it you may not be aware of that it could be small  and generally using it almost as a pivot point..Anchoring creates tension in the hand and resistance when moving so generally its a bad habit and definitely will restrict how well you can pick.  If its good enough then great otherwise spending some time to get use without the anchor.A plant however is not necessarily bad.  There are many players that make a loose contact with guitar body with the pinky and it can be handy as a reference point.The idea with this is not to anchor it i.e. you dont push into the guitar use it as a pivot nor have any tension in your hand.Loads of great players do this more often that not they almost have a something in between drifting from fully floating to contact dependent on what they are playing Guthrie Govan does this alot i.e. much more liquid  free technique that adapts for every occasion.The other way as you mentioned then is to then completely float no anchor and works fine as well.  Make sure when you pull the fingers up you dont like balls into a fist  create tension in your hand.The most important thing about picking is you need a fluidic relaxed movement.  Tension is bad.My personal opinions anchoring very bad and its worth dropping the anchor  pivot.  I dont like the fully floated technique but my hand does drift that way sometime. I like to use my fingers more in hybrid picking styles often and I found to pick my fingers up  fully float I get subtle tension.  So I generally have a intermittent pinky contact and float.  I think an adaptive  fluid technique is good and dont like to force myself into one way  a corner.I think a great thing to try when it comes to picking is video recording yourself and comparing your hand to other professional guitarists on youtube.Pick  guitarists you think are good ones in the styles of music to play and generally not a bad idea to pick someone like viasatchgilbertguitrie as they have quite extreme technical skills.Find vidoes of closes ups of their picking hands on youtube.  Look at wrist position fingers angles how they hold the pick and how everything works.Then try to emulate their technique one at a time.  So record yourself play around.  Any pain then stop.  For each player note what you like  dislike about their technique and really what works for you.Take all the bits you like gt develop your picking technique.Picking technique is a very personal thing there are some obvious techniques but really your biomechanics  your body is unique so its about finding something that works for you specifically.,Guitar,cky9r0u,2,t5_2qi79

Whats the difference between a Peavey s distortion and a Fender Blues Jrs distortion? Theyre just different thats all. Playing guitar isnt a specifically objective thing other than if youre doing whatever the hell you wanna do and you like it youre doing it right.  A pedal can add variety and versatility. More colors on your palette. Theres also the functional aspect want more gain out of your tube amp at lower volume? Throw an oddistortion pedal in front.

2061491,0,t3_2ig2fj,If you are looking for a specific sound search for the guitarists rig their setup.  You can find the exact equipment they use.  If you are experimenting with multiple sounds I suggest getting a solid state amp with a good clear channel and a Multiple effects board   There are many great amps out there both new and Vintage.  It can get expensive really quickly.  My rule of thumb.  I will buy something used in a category and something of an entry level.  When I can tell the difference between solid state and tube or Ephipone and Gibson then Ill upgrade.  You can get many different opinions.  The most important thing is to have a rig setup and to play what you have.  Les Paul and Marshall combo is classic.  Tons of bands rock them.  Play and play some more then go into Guitar Center and plug into some other amps Orange has a great gritty tube sound.  Hughes and Kettner is another great brand for great tube sound.

2097826,0,t1_cl6h0uk,Sure. The first one I already answered I think If you want to know any more specific details about that you can just go ahead and ask me. To the second and third question When I got my Electric Guitar and my Amp I payed around  Ibanez ART  and Line  Spider IV  watt. I still use the exact same setup for my electric guitar today  years later I am  years old now. Of course now that I play for some time now I really want to get more and better gear but I guess you know the struggle with money for people our age. But with that I just want to say that you can get a relatively good gear for about   USD but for some time you can surely found some really good second hand gear and save a lot of money to get more in the range of your budget. Just look around your local craigslist and maybe if you have a friend who plays the guitar or knows something about it get him to help you picking out something and if you decide to try something get him along to look at the guitar and play it for you to see if everything is alright. But also first hand you can get some decent stuff for maybe around  lets say. As a beginner you just need a guitar an amp a cable and probably a tuner and some picks. If I was you I would save up a little more than you plan to maybe around    and for that money you can get everything you need as a beginner Id say. Hope that helps you and sorry if my writing is confusing English is not my main language.  ,Guitar,cl6hagf,1,t5_2qi79

Double or triple your tracks for a fuller sound and to add some depth to the track. Use the tools that are available to get the right mix of each instrument. Add boost for solos if you dont have a pedal that provides it. Write down your favorite settings for the amp as well as the mix down phase as you may need to redo some parts for clarity or muddiness.I havent used that particular software so others can give you tips and tricks to fine tune your mix in regards to that.

2295979,0,t1_clvhlcf,Hey I appreciate you taking the time to look into this.  I know I can get kind of snarky and it probably doesnt help further the discussion.  Lets go through these points You are right the frequency remains the same.  However it doesnt matter which or how many frequencies are present the rule still applies.  An interesting way to think about what is happening with the total vibration of the string is as a Fourier Series  Basically this means that the confusing jumble of squiggles you see when looking at the waveform of a guitar note can be reduced to a collection of sine waves all added together.  So when the vibrations move from string to body and back you can think about it as a large number of sine waves moving back and forth maintaining their frequencies and changing speed.  Keep in mind that at the boundary points some of the wave will be reflected back along the string and some will be transmitted to the body.  Then when moving back from the body some will be reflected back into the body and some transferred back to the string.  Even if the body could somehow change the frequencies when they are transferred into it the amount in comparison to the vibration of the string are going to be incredibly small by the time they make the trip. A simpler and more easily understood definition is the tendency of a system to oscillate with greater amplitude at some frequencies than at others.  A resonance in a body wont actually change anything about the waves moving through it.An interesting thought is that if the bodys resonance did have a way to change the frequency of the wave it would only happen when you played notes that had that frequency as a component. Bingo! So the natural frequency is what you hear when you say tap on the guitar.  When dealing with a continuous or repeated external force like the waves coming from the string the natural frequency doesnt have the same physical meaning.  So if I tap on the guitar and hear a particular tone that doesnt really have any meaning when it comes to how it will interact with waves transmitted from the string. The shape is a key factor in the natural frequency of a rigid body.  In fact it is probably the most important factor.  Take a look at a set of tuning forks  They are all made from the same material but have a different shape which changes their natural frequency which means they ring at a different note when struck.  If the natural frequencies of a guitar body had any effect on tone the shape of the body would impact the tone more than the type of wood chosen.,Guitar,clvhz34,4,t5_2qi79

Practiced all the four finger permutations and three finger permutations for about a few months along with practicing applying the new looseness dexterity and control in solos which is super important. Now the longest ive gone is two months without playing it takes about two days of light workouts to the every ramped back up. These practices really really pay off when done regulary. One of the more important things youll gain is muscle memory of how to really shred. Youll be able to ditch the daily routine and still maintain and gradually increase less sustained speed.,Guitar,cm2rnn2,1,t5_2qi79
2356016,0,t1_cm1078y,OP I would recommend not taking this advice. Becoming technically better at the guitar is all about efficiency not strength. You build up enough strength playing guitar in a few months.  It takes surprisingly little strength to fret a note. Try this. With you fretting hand pick any note on any fret and lightly touch it. Pick the note and you should get a nice muted thunk. Slowly apply pressure to the string and continue to pick the note until you get a nice clean sound. It really didnt take much did it? That is how you should be playing  of the time unless digging in will give you the desired sound usually for dynamics. You should get virtually no pain unless you are stretching your fingers to your limits and even then you probably wont be able to sustain the motion for a long time. If youre getting pain in your forearm or fretting hand youre probably doing something wrong. If you want to continue to be self taught you have to look at your playing very hard and be very honest. Here is my advice.Fretting HandTry to use as little motion as possible. Fret as lightly as you can to get the sound you want. Curl your fingers and use the tips to fret the notes exception is the index finger. Generally you will want to keep it straighter to mute the higher notes. Do not apply force with your thumb. It should be resting on the neck of the guitar. When you fret a note the motion should come from your knuckle not your finger joints. Keep you fingers curled so the tip hits the strings but keep it as relaxed as you can. When you release the fretted note dont pull your finger away from the guitar release the pressure you are applying. Ideally your fingers should relax when you do this and float very close to the strings. This will allow you to play faster. It is hard to do at first and it will probably have to be practiced slow if youre not used to the motion. But the main reason you dont want to use your pull your finger away from the strings when you release the note is because the motion requires you to straighten your fingers and bend them again this is unnecessary movement an will tire your hand out quick. If you try to play fast you probably will get the claw where your entire hand locks up. I swear to god I can play for hours and not get fatigued. Last night I played for about  or  with breaks. Then theres little things to look at. Are you lifting fingers when you dont need to? I used to have this terrible habit of lifting my index finger when playing  note per string patterns. e.g.  to infinity. Every time I came back to the A note  I would lift my index finger. Why? It didnt add anything and is just extra wasted movement.If youre or aspire to be a gigging guitarist play standing up as much as possible. It is way easier to play sitting down but the mechanics are a little different. The guitar sits differently. You can rest the guitar on your fretting hands leg instead of your picking hands leg and its a bit closer but still not the same. Picking HandSimilar idea to fretting. Relaxed is the way to go. There are a few ways to hold the pick but the general idea is you dont want to have it flat when you are picking. It is common to tilt the pick towards the headstock if your picking with your right hand you would rotate it so the left side o the pick is angled towards the ground. It is also fairly common to rotate the pick slightly away from your body so the tip is higher than the wide end. This will reduce drag on the strings. You want to hold the pick tightly but not choking it. The motion I use to pick like this is kind of a wrist rotation think turning a doorknob.NonTechnical StuffIf youre trying to play fast or a fast tempo and doing th notes or something dont try to count out the subdivisions to make sure youre in time.  Just make sure the st note is hitting on the beat. It is impossible to count all that out.Steal as much as possible. Dont feel bad about it. Just dont pass it off as your own and give credit where credit is due. Everyone does it. If you like something learn it play with it make it your own.Try to tap your foot in time with the beat while you play. If you lose time or hit a snag it probably means you were trying to do something too complicated. It can be hard at first but you will begin to feel the beat a lot better and it really helps to internalize it.Im sure theres more but its Friday and thats all I got.,Guitar,cm2wxrq,2,t5_2qi79

If I want to learn songs I love then theory isnt important but if I am trying to put whats in my head down on paper then learning the relationships between notes and other basics of theory is important if for no other reason than to speed up the process. I could spend all day noodling around trying to find that right chord or use a little theory and get there quicker.

2374096,0,t1_cm53c8h,There are many ways to switch scales but it always depends on what harmonies your soloing on. If you play for example Cmajor you can always sitch to Aminor and if you play Cminor you can always switch to Ebmajor  steps down or up also a major Pentatonic can be played instead of the usual Heptatonic.The thing is that a scale is always in reference to the Harmonies underlying they should be more or less essences of the scale you want to use.If you are still a beginner i would suggest you start with learning the major scale and the Pentatonic in all Patterns and keys. Then you move on to Arpeggios which are essentialy Scales but in thirds This is also the formula to build chords. Pick a Tone of the major scale and then go up in thirds and you will get a chord.In the end there are only  notes and  of them are in a major scale that means that even if you play a wrong note the correct one is just one stup updown. Therefore its actually really usefull to learn the chromatic scale all  notes. Then you will get a jazzy sound. Look up targeting for more info on that.Dont get your head wrapped up to much in scales though it sounds boring. Instead try to always sing along to the scales youre practicing. This will have the effect that after some time might take a year you will be able to sing a note in your head and then play it on the guitar and that is what its all about.The scales should be a servant to what you want to play what is in your head not the other way around.I hope that helped.,Guitar,cm55ar2,1,t5_2qi79

2403334,0,t1_cm88scs,Okay so I agree with you on some stuff here but I think youre answering a slightly different question than the rest of us. The question youre answering is should there be more female guitar players? I think more than Why are there fewer female guitar players than male guitar players?Youre right in that there doesnt have to be a  split  sometimes men like activities that women dont and viceversa which is fine. What OP was getting at I think is that there is some sort of barrier that keeps more women from playing guitar. OP is asking us to consider that the uneven distribution isnt caused by simply men like playing guitar more often than women do and that it is caused by something else.If thats the way it is and men are simply more likely to take an interest in guitar than women are then theres no problem. But if we as a musical community or as a larger society are doing something to prevent more women from doing this thing we love shouldnt we talk about that? Shouldnt we be open to introspection and make it easier for more people to do this if we can? I think we should and I think these conversations are important. ,Guitar,cm8rehb,1,t5_2qi79

2522079,0,t1_cmnrf26,Look online for your model of guitar. Im pretty sure most Jackson guitars are .so for tunings as low as drop B or A Id be looking at least a  set. As for setting it up once you have the guitar restrung youre gonna want to check your action intonation and truss rod tension. Action is easy. Its just moving the bridge or string saddles higher or lower depending on preference. Most people like it low. But you have to make sure youre not causing any fret buzz. If you play any note on any fret and you get some rattle or dead note youre gonna want to raise your action. Intonation is not as easy for beginners. Its what keeps your strings in tune all the way down the neck. Rule of thumb is that you want the th fret harmonic and the th fret regular to be the exact same in terms of tuning. Youre going to want to make sure you have a pretty decent tuner that has a needle to show where your note is. To actually adjust said intonation youre gonna want to adjust the individual string saddles horizontally either moving it left or right. If the harmonic is in tune but the fretted note is sharp you have to move the saddle to the rightaway from the neck. Or if the harmonic is in tune but the fretted note is flat then move the saddle to the left  closer to the neck. This is a very tedious process that will take a while to get perfect. Now as for truss rod adjustment. There may be no need to touch this if theres no real change in tension. Yes youre using thicker strings but youre also down tuning so it kinda counter balances each other. However its always good to check. After about a day or  after you restring your guitar youll want to see if theres any bowing in the neck. To check this easily take a capo and put it on the st fret. Now find the fret where the neck meets the body. This is roughly the th fret but youll be able to see for yourself. Hold down the thicklow string at this fret. Now at the thth fret the distance from the bottom of the string to the top of the fret wire should be mm. If you dont have a ruler on you you can use a mm pick to check by sliding it between the string and fret. If the pick doesnt get held and the gap is too big or if the pick gets held too tightly and the gap isnt wide enough youre going to have to adjust the truss rod accordingly. This is something that I wouldnt do without perfect knowledge of what Im doing. If you have no idea how much to turn the truss rod or which way then see a professional for this. Messing with the truss rod is an easy way to wreck your neck if youre careless. Hope this all helps. ,Guitar,cmnruma,2,t5_2qi79

The same people who will always hate me and I am  ok with that.Sometimes it hurts REALLY bad that she would help me do her kind of music but since I chose to pursue metalcore she wont forgive me and refuses to help  she cut me off financially.It made me better as a metal artist though  even if I am struggling so much financially that I can neither perform or practice right now it makes me that much more determined that I will never sell out to the industry that wants to punish me with poverty.I really believe that if we push against the discrimination against our culture and musical tastes hard enough we can shadow the people in that industry and punish them with our success rather than allow them to celebrate our losses.,Guitar,cmqaej2,1,t5_2qi79

So say you have a key of C song and then you play it with a capo on the nd fret the song would now be in the key of D however you can play it just as easily as it was in the key of C.The reason for it being most popular in the first  frets is because if you have a song in the key of C with no capo then play it with the capo on the th fret the song will now be in the key of G which is just as easy to play without a capo.,Guitar,cn6mp1f,1,t5_2qi79

Biggie to Tribe Called Quest to Wu Tang Clan to Pac. Even Joey Bada is pretty good I think how many songs are just the same couple notes repeated over and over and over for like  minutes. Its rhythm.

Definitely work on thirds a lot though since basically all music is based around that interval.

2719227,0,t3_2r7ch6,When I started playing I thought Id be a Gibson man HUGE Jimmy Page fan. I was sure of it. Bought myself a few epiphones and finally an ESP EC. I even had an Epiphone Hummingbird. I drew pictures of my dream Gibson.I respected Fender was an avid Floyd and Hendrix listener but I thought it just wasnt for me. After all theyve got bolt on necks those weird hollowsounding single coils and they just didnt look like a beautiful piece of craftsmanship to me. Id tried a few Squiers that friends owned but I just wasnt impressed.Then about  years into playing Im at a gig. It was a bar gig. Basically the setup was that Id show up after school and play for  hours that means just  minute sets then I could repeat since no one is staying past about that amount of time unless theyre drinking. Id get  flat and I was allowed to have a tip cup. Not a bad gig for a high school student who didnt want to be at home.So that night theres this guy. The owners are telling me all about him. Legend in the town. Went on to tour with BB King a few times and has played with a bunch of other big names. His name was Cello.So he gets up there with his Olympic White Fender Stratocaster going into a vintage Fender Twin Reverb. Im already silently judging him. Not just because hes on my turf so to speak I had to stop playing an hour in but because hes getting up there with a bunch of equipment from what I believed was an inferior brand. But my god.... He was amazing! Blew me away. I guess until then Id never really payed attention to tone as much as I should have. He really opened my eyes that night.I went through some knockoffs and workalikes throughout the years Yamahas Ibanezes ESPs etc but  years later Im rocking two Fender Strats MiMs with upgradesmods going into a Fender Amplifier Champ SE.For me its what works. I guess its the way the music rolls out of it. I feel completely in control and know how it reacts. The notes roll off my fingers like butter. I almost feel like Im cheating when I play because it plays so easily!Anyway thats my story with Fender. I love them. I dont mind playing something else but if you gave me a choice between a  Gibson and a  Fender Id pick the Fender every time.,Guitar,cnd5xko,93,t5_2qi79

2773581,0,t1_cnjacgl,If you meant how to solo chordbychord instead of soloing by playing the overall key.... well I wouldnt say that isnt exactly a thing. Hear me out before jumping on my case potential educated readerSoloing chordbychord is a characteristic found almost exclusively from my experience in Jazz. Im afraid I cant get too deep into jazz here and even if I could I confess its one of my week points.What you may find more useful is the concept of emphasizing and outlining the underlying chords as you go along. By far the most effective way to do this is to become familiar with arpeggios.If you didnt already know an arpeggio is a chord played note by note in order. They frequently will outline chord shapes you already know. Use an arpeggio  played forwards backwards or any way you can think of  over a specific chord as is plays and the notes should sound totally sweet. You can find arpeggio shapes and lessons all over the web Im sure.Beyond just playing those shapes if you know what notes make up a given chord as that chord plays you can use that knowledge to emphasize those notes while making up your solo based on the key. The chord tones may be outside of the key which guarantees they will sound interesting.Edit I got a little sidetracked and didnt explain myself well. Soloing chord by chord is definitely a thing but what that usually means is that a scale is played outlining a specific key so chordtone soloing doesnt mean keys are thrown out the window.,Guitar,cnjcgf6,3,t5_2qi79

Listen to the melody that you can sing in your head and if it sounds good then project it to the guitar. Or even vice versa try to develop a melody on the guitar and if it sounds good use it. ,Guitar,cnkip73,1,t5_2qi79

2784693,0,t1_cnkl97j,Start slow. Like REAAAALLY slow. You want to be able to play the song or individual sections of the song like how I did it at very slow speed  or so perfectly with perfect tone and note quality. Then gradually speed up by . or  whichever you feel comfortable with and work on that speed until its perfect. If you ever feel like its too slow to do anything right then try playing it at full speed once and try to hit as many notes as you can. John Petrucci has a practice technique from this video which is well worth the  hours to watch and practice on by the way similar to this where he practices something at a relatively low tempo then cranks up the tempo to a speed that he cant do and tries to do as best as he can. When he goes back to the lower tempo it now may be easier to play after trying ludacris speed Thats where this comes from.Also very little progress will be done if you do not make an effort to serious practice. Daily practice for at least  minutes not counting stretches and warmups are what I did for this song and most days I  go for an hour or so.Drink water when practicing. It may sound weird but whenever Im dehydrated I do everything much more poorly. Its like in Space Jam when Bugs gives them Michael Jordans Secret Stuff. Water is amazing do it.Make sure to wash your hands with soap beforehand to get all the grease and oils off your fingers so your right hand doesnt slip on the pick and you have a solid control of your left hand. However if its cold you may want to use warm water to warm up your hands. I find its very difficult to try to play with cold hands and warming them up can take a while.Every once in a while you should track your progress for the whole song and see what percentage of the tempo you can play it at perfectly.Also stretching is very importantUse Audacity to loop sections slow tempo and portion off parts of the song to practice more efficiently.Thats kind of all I got for now if you need any thing else just ask I may have some other tips I cant remember right now.,Guitar,cnklyhz,2,t5_2qi79

2790467,0,t3_2s02ar,First learn the major minor and pentatonic scales.Next you need to know the key of the song. When you know the key you can play the same scale. For instance if the the key is Am any of the notes in the Am scale are fair game. All those notes are in key. You can play them more or less in any order you want inventing riffs that use the notes in the scale. Step out of key if you want a bit of dissonance. But youll find notes in key are what you are probably expecting to hear.Then break all those rules and see how that sounds.I cant recommend Frank Zappa enough when it comes to melody and soloing.

2832387,0,t3_2sjhl1,I own a Firebird and have worked on a number of ES series guitars over the years. I find that the Firebird is much more similar at least in terms of sound to a strat with stacked humbuckers instead of a typical gibsontype guitar. The necks are flexible thin and easy to maintain with truss rod adjustments and the tuners are remarkably stable. No string breakin time as you dont need them to settle around the pegs. Now problem is steinberger replacement tuners are somewhat expensive and there arent too terribly many options for replacement pickups out there. If you dont like the firebirds stock pickups you might be out of luck unless you really want to pay for the duncan equivalents. The guitars can also be somewhat awkward to play sitting down but its something you get used to.The ES guitars are essentially glorified Les Pauls. Thicker necks familiar headstock design abundant parts and replacements if you ever want to change anything. That said I find that they have more downsides than benefits. Theres no control cavity meaning if you want to do anything to the pots or switch youll have to fish all of the parts through a little hole behind the bridge pickup or through an F hole. Speaking of the pickups used I find that these guitars can often get a bit muddy under any amount of gain. Not a problem if youre going to be playing mostly clean obviously but dont expect to get fullon rock out of this guitar without some definition loss and some feedback.,Guitar,cnq1dbd,2,t5_2qi79

Essentially a thicker fender tone. Ive seen more MM bass players than guitar players.Not to knock them they have some great colors great woods great tones but those necks seriously drop the demand. Also Fenders are set up great from factory  you dont have to knock other companies to make another look better especially when they were both started from the same guy even if Ernie ball owns em now.,Guitar,cntpu07,1,t5_2qi79

Theres nothing wrong with having simple parts you dont have to be Yngwie in order to be recognizable.To make a long story short if youre trying to develop your own style the easiest way is by listening to a bunch of different musicians and trying to learn something from each one once you piece everything you learned together boom theres your style.This is only in regards to playing style theres a lot more to it though things like stage presence also have a pretty big impact on how people perceive you as a guitarist and a musician.,Guitar,co7mcf2,0,t5_2qi79

I think something like this would be ideal...Vintage little marshall can do your hendrix clean thing straight through to eighties hair metal and nineties hard rock. Thanks to the lack of digital circuitry they are very reliable and easy to fix if you break it. Has a very nice fx loop if you ever get into pedals. I think these old bastards have a lot more character than all the modern blackstars fenders and voxes you see everywhere. Go vintage its cheaper and will set you apart and give you a less common tone to hone. Amps like these weigh a little over  pounds.

This guy must have lost it.Colossal epic fail.Ive been on that merry go round. I also paid a dear price in life to jump the hell off and make certain I never get smuggled on again. I really like living in the sane world the free world.. He will learn the hard way the price of his fame is the sale of his very soul. He might also learn that going home no longer means his family. Hard lessons hard life and I wish hed stay in his job than to take the leap into hell. I am certain he could form a band and keep his job and being a street musician means being discovered for some but those same musicians have also placed their price to play or create at  which is what the industry will always pay those who take fame over moneyNot everyone who gets discovered wants to be by the time it happens. Take my word for it bro keep your job and youll get farther musically and financially than you would as a street performer. Put together a band. Just so you know contract guitarists for the business who dont have bands make peanuts on  for those slavedrivers the small clique that owns it all and all the business that make it happen and they live like slaves. If you leave after they dont pay you they sue you for more than youve ever made. If he sees any of them tell him we asked for him to give them a BIG FAT Fck YOU from us.I chose to walk away and sent a stark message that Id rather work in a back office in a rural town in the middle of nowhere than to drop an album living in the gutter. I am worth more than I got and the favor wont be forgotten. So I walked away and I dont regret it as I am now further into creating what I envision without them and I also have a better quality of life.The whole point of this guys move is to get signed however he needs to listen to the people who have been offered things that arent worth the paper they are written on and that a job financial independence and money is worth more the biggest label in the universe saying they will back you.Id rather get paid for my work.Enough said. Unfortunately if my guitarist chooses to make this dive I am going with.. I might well eat my words. However mine knows that a job and equipment like amps guitars PAs and a roof is needed and its not worth working for crumbs even to make it. He also knows the people in the business screwed us both sideways while we were still technically working the day job circuit and whom to avoid unlike OP.To make it in Hollywood you need to believe in a utopian socialist fantasy one that means you may not make money but you will be famous. You need to be able to live without anything but what handouts you receive.If it makes me not good enough to make it in music because I wont give up money and I expect to be paid well for my musicwork then I am happy with that.My own band worked our tails off to get even the financing of one day job and about to have two and I really would not do anything for free for the industry because if the goal is to make money off music OP is going the WRONG WAY..Theres greedy men who will profit off of men like OP.EDIT OP and  other males who like lies will never wear girls jeans in California.,Guitar,cogedf1,-3,t5_2qi79

3134713,0,t3_2w148b,.  Change the strings  at a time dont take all the strings off at once and dont detune any of the other strings when putting on a new string.  If you do tuning it up will become more difficult as changing the tension on one string affects all the others.  If the other  strings were in tune before  string breaks theyre still probably pretty close to in tune when you put the new string back on and tension it up to pitch.  If you do take all the strings off at once you have to sort of gradually tension them all up at once to get the thing in tune again which is a lot harder than just doing them  by ..  Youll need an allen wrench to open up the locking nut and the thing thats holding the strings at the bridge and some wire cutters to cut off the ball ends of the new string and to trim the other end of the string when youre finished.. At the bridge theres six hex little bolts or machine screws might be a better term one for each string that press a little steel cube up against the string like six tiny little vises.  Theres nothing holding those little cubes in but the pressure of those bolts.  So when you loosen one of those bolts dont turn the guitar over or that little cube will fall out.  You dont need to loosen the bolts very much certainly dont remove them.  Just loosen enough so that the old string or whats left of a broken string can come out and so you can put the end of the new string in.  . Likewise you dont need to take the lock at the nut apart just loosen it a bit enough for the old string to come out and the new one to go in.  In fact you only need to loosen one of the three screws each of which will unlock  strings..  After taking off a string adjust the fine tuner knob for that string on the bridge to the middle of its range i.e. unscrew it in or out about half way.. to put on a new string after taking one old string off cut off the ball end put that end of the string into the little vise mechanism in the bridge tighten the bolt on the little vise to clamp the string thread the other end of the string through the lock at the nut and into the tuning peg and tune the string up..  Dont tighten up the lock at the nut immediately.  First stretch the string with your fingers a bit it will drop out of tune a bit when you do this  tune it up again with the tuning pegs not with the fine tuners  leave that in the middle of its range for now.  Repeat this stretchingtuning a few times until the string stays in tune.  After tuning up and stretching the new string check the other strings and tune them as needed with the tuning pegs unlocking the nut as needed.  They should be close to in tune but unlocking the nut may mean theyre a little out.  You may have to go back and forth on the strings as tuning one string will affect the others.  The thicker strings affect the other strings more than vice versa so if you have multiple strings out of tune start with the low E and work your way up.  By the time you get to the high E you may find that now the low E is out of tune again.  If you know this is going to happen Say for example because the A and the D are a bit flat and tuning them up will throw the low E flat you can tune the low E a bit sharp then when you tune up the A and the D the sharp low E will drop down a bit.. Once all the strings are in tune tighten down the lock at the nut do not overtighten though.  Locking down the nut may send the guitar just slightly out of tune this is fairly normal.  Fix it up with the fine tuning knobs on the bridge starting with the low strings working towards the high strings.  If you find a fine tuning knob doesnt have enough range because it wasnt in roughly the middle of its range when you started you can turn it to the middle of its range unlock the nut and tune the string up with the tuning peg then relock the nut.. Dont over tighten the bolts at the bridge or at the nut  esp. at the nut overtightening can be bad if you have for example one of those Ibanez super wizard necks thats ridiculously thin.. If you put heavier or lighter strings on the guitar you may find that as you try to tune up the bridge is rising up out of the guitar when tuned up strings too heavy or sinking down into the guitar possibly bottoming out strings too light.  In those cases you may have to adjust the springs in the back of the guitar either using the screws to change the tension or adding or removing a spring in extreme cases.  Best to choose a string gauge and stick with it and if youre not familiar with a floyd rose dont change the string gauge until you know what youre doing..  Likewise if the guitar is downtuned to say E flat rather than E attempting to tune it up to E will likely require adjusting the spring tension to keep the bridge from rising up out of the guitar too far.  If you need to change tunings for different songs and need a floyd rose then the correct answer is to have multiple guitars for that purpose.,Guitar,comws1t,1,t5_2qi79

3199984,0,t1_cotlb6p,The above are all really good ones.  Once youve got those down on pat  and heres one I think is a pretty good one especially for soloing  recreate chords for any songs on the highest three strings.  What this is really important for is giving you ideas for the good sounding notes across the fretboard and will allow you to not get stuck in the boxes that scales inevitably put you in.  Ill explain what I mean because this sounds really complicated but is actually really simple.Take the Achord for example.  After the above advice youll probably know how to play it in cowboy chord form AKA those three fingers on those three strings and bar chord form.  Now only play the highest three strings of that chord i.e. G B and E strings.  Still all the notes you need for an A chord.Now try this exercise  make the Dchord shape.  Now what I want you to do is slide up and down the neck with that shape until you find the one place with those three strings where you also get an Achord.  Go on try. Answers for the classs th fret e string th fret b string th fret g stringPretty cool.  Now also keep in mind the E barchord form and play the three highest notes and move up those three strings to where it should sound like the A chord. Answers this ones pretty simple basically three highest notes of A bar chord in E bar chord formSo now you already have all these places on the fretboard where you can do an Achord!  This works for minor chords too.  Keep in mind the Aminor bar chord shapes the Eminor bar chord shapes and the Dminor cowboy chord shape.  Try practicing with those shapes across the board on those three strings with say an Eminor chord.Practice listening to songs you like with pretty standard chord progressions and try to match those with the above different shapes.This was a HUGE selflearning step for me.  Instead of constricting myself to usual patterns relearning chords all over again can help me understand across the fretboard what notes sound pleasant to the key Im in or which dont so no matter where Im at I can always have a good sounding note.  Help me out here music theory people but I believe this is called inversions of chords in which the order of notes that make up a chord going from lowest to highest are different each time.Best part this can bypass or at the very least substitute theory.  This helps you intuitively learn how chords and chord progressions work and its simple too because it constricts you to three strings.  Once youve found all the nooks and crannies try them with different string combinations that are close to each other BGD or G D A.  Experiment.  Watch how fast you grow.TLDR To recap try replicating majorminor chords with these simple shapes D Dm EEm bar chord AAm bar chord but with the highest three strings.,Guitar,cotoeyh,7,t5_2qi79

We need this information to know what kind of switching options you have and what you need to do based on them. The actual makemodel is usually irrelevant but that information provides the data were looking for.          You can use a passive piezo. I use a passive piezo. It isnt that it cant be done its that it has significantly less volume than a traditional humbucker and can actually reduce the overall maximum volume when combined The pickups by themselves work normally but the maximum volume is lower when the piezo is used in combination. Its not that it wont work passively but in no way should you expect the piezo to have the same kind of volume that a regular pickup does.          The reason I suggested a preamp is because the volume difference is genuinely huge and the preamp would help compensate for that. ,Guitar,coumhhb,0,t5_2qi79

3229456,0,t3_2x1y70,I guess I do. Eleven years ago I used to look at the black cherry EC  on the ESP website and think One day you will be mine. Then I went off to university and then worked a series of shitty jobs. One day I saw a Gumtree ad for a second hand one at a price I could actually afford. Then I remembered a debt that needed paying so I put the guitar out of my mind as a deal that good obviously wouldnt be around long. A few years later I was getting some numbers off an old phone and found the number for the guy who had the ESP. Figured might as well call him turns out he still had it. Went to pick it up after work that day three and a half years ago. The thing is having convinced myself Id never own such a quality guitar I often sort of forget that I have it and sometimes when I play it it feels too good for me. But you have made me realise that I own my dream guitar and that I should show it more attention. ,Guitar,cowql0v,1,t5_2qi79

3238891,0,t3_2x7wdb,Ive struggled with this one as well and I found a few things that have helped me.First of all its not all about the guitar.  Myself and others I see get so focused on learning the guitar practicing scales etc is so overly guitar focused.  Even in your title how to be creative on the guitar is focused on the guitar and how to be creative on it rather than saying how to be creative.  It may seem nitpicky but Ive found that is more than a subtle difference.Guitar is just a guitar as my friend put it it its a plank of wood with some strings on  its a means to make sound.  How we choose to arrange those sounds to express or convey something has little to do with making the sounds  and something along the lines of more our minds  heart.  This is much more on the creative element.I like this concept of a being a musician I read something Guitrie Govan said that stuck with me not so much be a guitarist more a musician who plays guitar.Parts of being a musician is the common bits of playing any instrument  feel for music i.e. feel for rhythm  groove note combinations etc creativity and I suppose instrument specific nuances.  That idea of being a musician playing the guitar and trying to be musical is one that helped me i.e. its not just about playing the guitar anymore its about trying to do musical things on the guitar.Assuming we have an ok feel for time etc and some skills on the guitar then to get to the crux of your question how be more creative I think you could boil that down into two things  How can I connect to the guitar and express my creativity more  How can I increase my creative naturegt The first is important because alot of people I think are creative they just dont know it  apply it.  One thing here that helped me alot was singing I put down guitar and sung solo.  The connection you get with the notes the feel focus on communication was mind changing.But in essence vocalisation exercises can help.  Put a chord or backing track on and try to vocalise some melodies or lines over the chords.  You dont need to be pitch perfect  beautiful resonant sounding but you need to vocalise as it connects dots in your brain  your brain knows what its trying to sing.Most people when they do this after a little bit even non guitarists  non trained musicians start trying to harmonise with the chords they start trying to group notes together in something that makes sense.  They start adding little start  stops to phrases becuase if feels wrong if they sing out like half a sentence dont sing words make noises e.g la la de da etc hum grunt even they work like sentencesi.e.  if you abruptly stop its kinda left hanging.  The idea here is already people are inventing melodies and working with the chord and rhythm nicely.  The are using their creativity  ear to pick stuff out of there air and make musical things.They are not thinking what key is this what chord is this what scale should I use these are the notes so lets sing around them and see what works  this is what people tend to do on the guitar  I certainly did.Dont get me wrong sclaes theory etc has a place mostly to help to understand musical situations and train the ear to deal with them also for things like more complex embellishment where melodic  singy  creative drives are a little lower.So anyway in terms of that connection if you connect that essence of the singy voice with creative goodness to the guitar  fretboard it can be very helpful its like being able to sing on the guitar so to speak.  This is not easy I only began to understand how connected you can get through a singing lessons Id highly recommend singing and still not quite there yet.Vocalisation exercises are great for this   First start with above can you vocalise a little blues melody or call  response or something over some chords.  Second over a sequence can you vocalise a line then play it on guitar droning a chord in the background is a handy start a fun thing here is vocalise a call and play an appropriate response on the guitar you can even guitar dual yourself voice against guitar  Third  vocalise the notes as you play themIt may not be for everyone but that greatly helped me I became alot more aware of what I was trying to play and really helped me understand and control my phrasing rhythm and note selection and in essence develop melodies and harmonise nicely with the chords.gt The second one of increase creative nature is something completely different.  I think alot of this boils down to who you are and more about you as a person than a technical skill.So really here the only things that have helped me is to try and develop myself as a person.  Related to music this would include listening to different genres keeping an open mind etc.  But it also means getting away from the guitar maybe reading seeing some of the world falling in love  heart broken etc.  Life experience helps as it helps define your unique character youre exposed to many emotions situations and dealing with them that you almost have a bigger pool of things to be creative on.This is much much more of a waffely  hippytastic realm.  The engineer in me cries but my songwriting and improv has greatly improved when I start putting more effort into to life than sitting in front of tv etc.I think a good read is Victor Wootens book the Music Lesson its got some many good  core concepts about music  doing it.  Inner game of music is an interesting book about music playing to potential and the mind games  subconcious things that go on.,Guitar,coxpupp,14,t5_2qi79

3243791,0,t1_coy5jhh,Dont know Revalver but from the video it looks similar to PositiveGrid Bias  lets you model an amp just as if you were designingtweaking it physically. It doesnt generally let you play with resistor values and stuff if Revalver really lets you do that but most of the big components are there. There is a Bias Desktop that is supposed to be more powerful in some ways but I use the iOS version so I dont know whats different.Bias also combines with Jamup XT where you can add lots of different effects pedals and tweak the knobs...so you can build an amp with a distortion you like in Bias then take it over to Jamup and add an overdrive or a muff or a tubescreamer pedal to it and tweak those knobs too. Very flexible and sounds great IMO.,Guitar,coy866g,2,t5_2qi79

3249469,0,t1_coypim0,I may suggest a balance of the two opinions.  Thumb over the top is probably the best way to mute that also there is the back of your picking palm as well is the situation permits it.Generally speaking muting is essential to developing a clean technique you mute with your fretting fingers sometimes with the thumb over the top with you picking fingers hand palm anything and everything.  When you can muting the same string with fretting and picking hands will make a cleaner sound.However as new account is suggesting thats one half of it.  Developing accuracy with your picking hand is also essential as you minimise the need for muting which allows you to potentially free fingers up more and mute lighter  be more nimble.Its also heavily stylistic.  For example if you want an extravagant strumming action then its impossible to miss that low e all the time.  Likewise if you want to play a more relaxed style like hendrix or rhcp muting and hitting that mute note adds a percussive edge to the attack which can be quite nice.But cleaner maybe some forms of classical folk jazz or even that clean rock  metal then you really want to be hitting that clean.Hourses for courses.  In essence mute mute mute but dont try and be too sloppy,Guitar,coytdpf,2,t5_2qi79

3298856,0,t3_2xwwky,Im a classical guitarist so technique can vary between classical guitar and steel stringed. Some general rules that we follow to develop good technique i.e. a method in which we play that requires less amount of strength and tension but able to produce a clear and full tone.Firstly your thumbs height should be adjusted to support the lowest closest to th fret that you press down on. Do not become static in thumb position and allow it to move freely to support your fingers as you play. Your thumbs height will naturally shift as you play.  Eg. if you are holding a C chord then your thumb moves to support your ring finger when playing a D major your thumb will be lower to support your index finger playing the A on the rd string. The thumb should be flexed and not bent with few positional exceptions. The only time that your thumb should bend over the neck is when you need it to hold down the th string. Do not point your thumbs tip inwards to try to support your playing. ,Guitar,cp4anzk,2,t5_2qi79

The thing is I know there are things that Ill need to adjust like the truss rod and the bridge of the guitar to get it sounding right. So my questions are   Will I have to tighten or loosen the truss rod?  Will I have to do this without strings on it The rod is hidden by a panel that looks to be impossible to get off while its strung?  Will I have to move parts of the bridge closer or further from the pickups?And to prove there are dumb questions heres one that just bothered me a few minutes ago When youre hungry do you feel like you play worse?

3312890,0,t1_cp5uyiz,Thanks man. Its hard to say since Im usually stuck in a dorm with just the IDCore. The easiest way would probably be to explain what I use each of them for. The SP is used for Jack White Silvertone kind of lofi sounds which it actually handles really well as well as some decent clean sounds. The Mustang isnt my favorite I usually only use it when I need the extra watts for jamming with friends it doesnt sound bad just kind of artificial good for cleans and the headphone out sucks. The HT is phenomenal when I just want to play without constantly screwing with knobs it does a great Marshall crunch as well as bluesy tones the high gain lead sounds are pretty nice too. And the IDCore is currently my go to because its all I have with me right now it sounds great sounds relatively tubelike has a great headphone output with cab emulation has awesome stereo effects and is super easy to setup for recording. Another thing I love about it is it handles low volume without sounding like complete shit whereas the HT needs the tubes to be flexed and the mustang speaker takes some volume before it opens up. So I guess the short answer is the IDCore a larger wattage if you can manage the  is really quiet unless youre suck in a dorm in which case its perfect. Its a pretty underrated amp. The long answer is succumb to GAS and buy all of them. Hope this helps.,Guitar,cp5wbi3,1,t5_2qi79

3319475,0,t1_cp6n2ge,The Marshall is a hand wired JTM clone and you got it Mark . The Mark V is KILLER and both channels are sweet. You can get a good crunch out of the nd channel. I have a Mark IIB coliseum at my practice space and the Mark II mode is pretty close. Thats a very blues rocktype amp when you dont have the gain dimed. The one thing that bummed me out about the V  is it isnt THAT quiet. Playing through a Mesa  not pictured you can get it reasonably low volumes. But the fat mode needs to be pushed a bit to get that blues tone. Totally doable if you arent trying to get bedroom levels and WAY more reasonable than its big brother. ,Guitar,cp6ncwy,3,t5_2qi79

A lot of these jobs should be done by professionals which I probably shouldve added in the post and yeah that depreciates it. But there are a lot of options for drop into too. To respond to replacing a nut I feel thats really a job for a luither there are a lot of subtleties involved with that which you kind of have to learn from someone rather than youtube videos. String height is a big one. Id never do a nut replacement on my own I wouldnt be comfortable doing so.  Replacing electronics is should be done after some practice with soldering.

The tubes will be operating at the same voltages regardless if the attenuator is in use or not.The only way the life of the tubes will be reduced would be if you are intentionally cranking the amp to overdrive the tubes and using the attenuator to bring the output to bedroom volume levels  the attenuator itself has no direct effect on the functionality of the tubes. If youre just using the attenuator to make a loud amp quieter you wont need to worry about any of this.The tubes will eventually need to be replaced at some point in time dont be afraid to put them to work in the meantime.,Guitar,cpc5pfj,3,t5_2qi79

Theyre incredibly cheap pedals and a lot of them have some really easy mods that are simple enough to get you interested in the world of pedal designbuilding without breaking the bank or your favorite pedal. My favorite mod is their Chicken Salad vibrato pedal. Basically they use a photo resistor to generate the depth of the effect and by putting a piece of tinfoil in the box they place the light source in you can get a pretty solid retrosounding vibrato effect well technically a tremolo but the misnaming isnt Danelectros fault. Pedal cost me like  and a gum wrapper. ,Guitar,cpcqjni,18,t5_2qi79
3373028,0,t3_2ytc7h,Hmm ok. Youve got a lot of pedals that will sounds very different depending on where you put them. At a glance I would go Tuner gt Compressor gt Morpheus gt Whammy wah gt Space Station gt Harmonist gt  OD gt Crybaby gt FM gt GE gt AM.For the FX loop Id go MM gt DL gt RC gt FRV.The problem is that things like the wah the equalizer the space station and whammy wah the harmonizer the AM will all sound different depending on where you put them in the chain. You need to take some time and think about which pedal you want to be affected further down the line by which effect if that makes sense.Theres a decent guide to pedal order in the sidebar of rguitarpedals that should get you started but you may have to do some playing around with the placement of a few pedals until you get a sound you like.,Guitar,cpcr0h7,1,t5_2qi79

3392463,0,t3_2z1p4n,The trick is to turn your amp up really fucking loud. Im not kidding. At low volumes you wont get that tube shimmery goodness. Turn your volume up to about  and master volume to taste. Then when you need a kick use your tube screamer with the level dimed and the gain maybe at  oclock at most. SRV and Mayers tone come from loud tube amps and just a bit of pedal boost. Dont use too much gain on the pedal because it will sound fuzzy. You wont get to their sound perfectly with a blues jr but the fundamentals of their tone is a loud fucking tube amp with a bit of breakup. The rest of it comes from your hands in terms of note attack vibrato etc. Edit forgot to mention that on a blues jr the EQ is subtractive meaning a good place to start with the EQ is to turn them all to  yes Fender amps go to  Nigel Tufnel eat your heart out and take away frequencies to taste.

You could post it and ask what people think about that part at  or even just post it because it sounds cool and is a little different. The point where wed start getting reports or complaints about it would be if at the end there was a buy Anthony DAmatos new EP here. Another example would be if someone did a gear review for a pedal. They are free to share it here so long as their video or main post does not include anything along the lines of subscribe for more gear reviews check out my article on it at my website be sure to look at the rest of the electro harmonix line etc.If people ask about purchasing an album where your article was originally posted or whatever comes up you are free to give them an answer in the comments.

This is a common method to avoid using your amps preamp stage a common enough problem if you want to use amp modeling as your front end. Some older amps might also have a separate power amp input on back panel but probably not your Bugera. The only problem you might encounter would be volume issues with your effects loop. There are lots of different types of effects loops with different controls and inherent volume levels. Your loop might be parallel ie mix or blend knob or series no blend knob. You might have switches for line level or high impedance for rack effects versus single pedals. If youre lucky you might have knobs for send and return levels. If you find that your effects preamp is too quiet or too loud clipping then look into these issues. ,Guitar,cpsoehm,1,t5_2qi79

PhilipsekBireli LagreneJoscho StephanAngelo DeBarreJeffrey GimblesJimmy SmithJohn ScofieldMike SternSteve KhanAllen HindsAllan HoldsworthLarry CarltonFrank Gambale.Those are the main players i listen to and learn from. They are taken from all eras of jazz from early jazz Charlie Christian to the jazz fusion of today Allan Holdsworth. If you go through this list you will have enough traditional jazz gypsy jazz and jazz fusion to last you a lifetime if not more. I would advice you though to start looking into other instruments aswell if you are interested in learning jazz. Jazz is not instrumentspecific so jazz musicians often learn from different instruments. I for one transcribe a ton of bass players because i play solo gigs with a singer and need to play chords and basslines. But i also transcribe a lot of piano and saxophone for lines. If you want other instruments let me know and i got a list for that aswell. Hope that was of any use to you. ,Guitar,cpudhvb,0,t5_2qi79
3528621,0,t1_cpuhg2j,I have never really thought about it too much. Skills and dexterity can and need to be developed independent of handedness. Left handers dont start out knowing how to play just because their fretboard hand is more dexterous.   That said...

3655112,0,t1_cq8tnpk,Aw its no problem. I like troubleshooting and mechanical puzzles. Im just a little worried that I might be coming up with increasingly complicated solutions that might lead you off the track of a simple fix. Its usually something simple. It doesnt sound like the tuner gears are worn out. So its probably just a matter of loosening the screws on the ends of the paddle. If that doesnt fix it and the neck is seated properly the only other ways the tuners could mess up are incredibly unlikely especially across multiple tuners at the same time. So its probably the screw thing.I guess its possible the tremolo could cause the warble but its not something Ive ever encountered with my Strat. Its easy to check though just tighten the screws that connect the tension springs to the inside of the back cavity until the bridge plate is flush with the body and see if that changes anything. You shouldnt have to replace the springs.One more unlikely but easy thing you can check is whether the saddle height adjustment screws not to be confused with the intonation adjustment screws that come in from the back of the bridge plate are all set so that the each bridge saddle is sitting fairly level. They dont have to be perfect but none of the saddles should be cocked at a weird angle. But those are just outside possibilities. My money is on it being either the strings sitting a little loose in the saddles or an artifact of a misadjusted pickup like that other guy suggested. Id play with the pickup thing first since its the simplest and cheapest. There are tons of YouTube videos and online articles out there on how to adjust pickup height. You can also press your ear up against the body of the guitar and see if can you still hear it without the amp.    ,Guitar,cq8wpz1,2,t5_2qi79

3672366,0,t3_32g5c7,I have the TM head and I had the HampampK x matching cab. I play with an MIA Strat. In my honest opinion I couldnt be happier with the tonal and volume flexibility of this amp. I play usually on one watt or five watt at home and i can get really nice saturated gains at TV volumes with ease when needed. Alternatively the clean channel is really nice but Id argue that in the lower watt modes it doesnt get loud enough! I use an EP boost to fix that though. In  watt mode I can easily keep up with a drummer when connected to a large cab and I still have room to get louder. All in all I love this cab and cant see myself switching to anything else for a long time. Let me know if you have other specific questions. Also I paid  for the head and cab used on Craigslist.

But it also didnt say for only ? thats insane I cant believe the craftsmanship. Ive always seen the guys who go such a great deal! why buy anything else! buy them. They spend  dollars on cables buy old Line  Rack mount units and multi effect pedals and get Peavey cabs and play obscure picks and strings. They play agiles Carvins Fernandes Cort Aria Pro II etc.OR they play very specific metal and they need something really specific to play but cant afford Custom order prices.Just all these items that seem to be great for the money but none of it sounds great in comparison with something else Side by side. Is it a great deal? Sure but when you play it along side something else with the same specs theres probably gonna be a huge difference in quality.Look at the specs though. The main draw really is Price  Features. So many things youre getting that others dont offer at a good price.Those are all highly specific and great lookin specs. So why only ? Look at ESP Schecter Ibanez Jackson or even Epiphone Squier they all charge more for even more mundane specs that are similar.

Notice that your index finger only needs to really press the open strings in a standard barre.

3740377,0,t1_cqilq0h,Yes indeed the locrian mode is a tricky one. I dont think i have actually heard a piece that is written with a locrian mode before i have heard it in passing in other music but not as the main focus. I personally only see locrian as an option when improvising over a halfdiminished chord together with two other options which would be Locrian nat  Locrian with a natural second degree basically making the same intervalic structure as a natural minor scale with a diminished fifth and harmonic minor. So i am afraid i cant really help you if you aim to compose with Locrian as the main focus because i have never heard of a way to resolve to it since it is too unstable because of the diminished fifth.Ah so you are studying Schoenberg perhaps? since you mentioned  tone row. I am unfortunately not that knowledgeable about modes in the classical realm and the  tone row my knowledge in classical both old and contemporary is limited to counterpoint and certain voice leading techniques. And i have not experimented with the  tone row system myself. I have performed some of Schoenbergs work however which was interesting to say the least.Are you familiar with all the modes of melodic minor and harmonic minor and know when to use them? Because other then that i cant really offer much more on the subject of modes. My knowledge only goes as far as i have transcribed so things that go outside the confines of jazz mainly Bebop and Hard Bop for me and Fusion ala Holdsworth and Howe is a bit blurry to me in that respect. ,Guitar,cqimllq,1,t5_2qi79

3747130,0,t3_33bq3d,Theory does benefit ear training in that it helps you quickly recognize groups of notes without having to sit there picking them out one by one slowly.Ill give you an example I was picking out a sequence of notes the other day by ear it was very hard to hear behind the other instruments and it was played extremely fast probably a nightmare for some people to figure out. But I recognized it as oh thats a minor th chord which made it a lot easier as I knew which notes were being played even though they were whizzing by at high speed.I think the main advantage to knowing some theory is to be able to instantly associate musical moods and progressions with the chords and intervals behind them.What I would do is learn something you think sounds magical and then figure out Why it sounds that way what notes over what chord or what chord change gives it that magic quality. Find out what theyre called so you can program your ear and hands to recognize them.,Guitar,cqjecga,9,t5_2qi79

Its happened before that what I think is tight and on top of the beat turned out to be just plain rushing.  Because of this its really not enough to throw on a metronome or drum track.  You need to fix the way you feel time.  If youre always ahead then you need to work on setting back the attack of each note.  At first it may feel like your forcing yourself to play behind but eventually youll learn to hear and sense the pocket.  As far as specific exercises its up to you and what your struggling with.  Whenever Im learning something new I first record myself playing it as best I can without a metronome.  I also take mental notes on that state of my timing or at least how it feels.  Then Ill put on a metronome work out the exact timing I even use the waveform and grid as a visual aid and compare it to my earlier recordings.  Again I look for differences between whats right and what I thought was right.

If you buy used youre not going to lose money but if you buy a new guitar for  its only going to be worth about  used. So right off of the bat you lost  and it will be a very long time before its worth  used in order for you to break even.  The production numbers are so high today on most instruments that theyll never really be worth anymore than a used new model in the future.

Blues guitar does commonly switch scales on each chord and whether or not your reasoning is sound in theory doesnt change what the intention of the player was. You should consider whether a classic blues player is thinking in modal theory or in the pocket of his comfort sliding a favorite riff to different positions based on the chord underneath  clearly most blues players use the latter.So follows that this player is more likely taking a favorite riff and changing scales on each chord change A minor riff over I chord Dmaj riff over IV chord Emaj riff over V chord.I think youre so distracted by trying to find a parent mode that fits the melody that you arent considering the reasoning of the player and thats why you arent technically wrong but why your method of thinking would be confusing to the beginners tracking this thread.,Guitar,cqrmgr0,2,t5_2qi79

Coconut Canola Flaxseed not linseed and Hemp oils all can go rancid and I would avoid these.Linseed Danish and Tung oil has been suggested as well but they are hardening oils and will actually leave a finish on your fretboard slowing darkening it with every application.  So I would avoid these as well.Best in my personal experience has been Mineral Oil or Lemon Oil which is actually  mineral oil.  Lemon Oil imo is the best that tiny bit of pure lemon oil in it does a really great job of cleaning your fretboard.

Or a tele or jazzmasterjaguar to be more alternative looking.I recommend going for something with a hardtail rather than a Floyd or similar. Easier to deal with. An Epiphone surely can be a good guitar too but I dont like certain things about them personal while others love them for the very same reasons.A strat can be pretty sweet too and squires can make good guitars. Ive got both a U.S. strat and a squire and I certainly prefer the fender but I dont mind playing the squire vastly upgraded electronics for lots of metal sound HSH.

4140722,0,t3_383x9k,Touching tubes doesnt hurt them.Sounds like someone is conflating tubes with halogen bulbs.Power tubes last on the order of hundreds of hours preamp tubes thousands of hours. If you play more than a couple of hours a day expect to buy replacement power tubes annually. Actually you should have a full set of replacement power tubes on hand for the inevitable gig emergency. Maybe another reason not to touch them might be damaging the tube sockets. Likely this amp is made with printed circuit boards so there may be a chance that bumping a tube might crack a solder joint so care is still required.Tube electronics were a major hobby for young people for decades. Although they can be dangerous the basics arent hard to grasp. Learn how to do minor repairs and maintenance and you can save yourself a lot of money.If youre hell bent on ensuring that you can pay taxes for as long as possible make sure you have some money set aside for repairs and maintenance. Depending on the quality of your repairman and what part of the country youre in the hourly labor rate can be   or more. Labor is the most expensive part of amp repair... except for power tubes and transformers. Power tubes run  each which isnt cheap if you have to buy four at a time. Power and output transformers can easily be   to replaceplus labor if something terrible goes wrong. Most everything else in an amp is super cheap to replace the part less than   but not always easy to pinpoint or diagnose.Thats why professionals arent cheap. Figure out what you are and are not willing to handle on your own and plan accordingly.An amp you cant fix or cant afford to fix is always just dead weight.,Guitar,crs9dlb,1,t5_2qi79

If chords are played in C major playing A minor pentatonic over that in any way you want will sound good. Learning to make chords in any major scale will help you throw in the right leads at the right times depending on how the song might change its key. The blues pentatonic is used in a lot of music and contains the devils note which always comes in handy when playing metal.,Guitar,crtmscw,2,t5_2qi79

Anytime I go to a local shop or any GCs the custom shop guitars that I am looking to try are either WAY up on the wall or behind a counter.  I totally understand not wanting the high dollar merchandise getting banged upstolen by random kids but I personally do not want some clown eyeballing me while I play or trying to sell me on the guitar I want to try. I want to walk in grab it off the rackwall plug it in and give it a shot.One of my main sticking points as Im sure most people will echo is price.  I would absolutely LOVE to support all the local mom and pop guitar stores but none of the ones Ive been to can compete with online pricing andor online sales.  Same for used gear you can usually find sites or auctions and get gear for pretty damn cheap but any place Ive been to in person has a decent enough mark up for me to turn around and leave.Im not generally one to try something in a store just to turn around and buy it online.

Practise to a metronome with a clean tone and ensure all the notes sound clear. Slowly increase speed.. Practise legato through some box patterns to increase left hand strength. Youll be surprised how much this can improve your playing.. Practise left and right hand separately! This is the biggie. Chuck on a metronome and try to pick  notes per string to the beat. Then other combinations. Then try and play a tune like twinkle twinkle little star with nothing but your left hand. Notice how difficult it will be to hammer on out of no where and adding vibrato without the assistance of your pick.Practising left and right hand separately will make your weaknesses extremely transparent and youll honestly take your playing to the next level.

I would however suggest that you think about a simple modification where you wire a pushpull volume pot in so you can get the neckbridge pickup combo also called  way switching. That pickup combination will get you into B.B. King territory.  Next I would suggest a midsized tube combo like a Fender Blues deluxe or a Hot Rod deluxe. They will give you enough clean headroom to work with while also taking a variety of pedals really well.  As far as effects go I would look around on youtube and see what appeals to you. A good overdrive and a wah pedal would probably be a good place to start.  ,Guitar,csb7aiq,1,t5_2qi79

4312073,0,t1_csbnchx,gt So you said an interval is a step in either direction.An interval is a measure of distance between two notes.  The formula to create an interval does not change depending on the direction you go.  If you want to a major th above your starting note you ascend  semitones.  If you want a major th below you descend  semitones. gtDoes this mean that a major th CB which is  semitones is also a minor secondA major th inverts to a minor second.  Inverting an interval is as simple as taking the bass note and transposing it up an octave so that it is no longer the bass note.  So if you have a C below the staff and a B on the staff forming a Major th to invert youd move the C up an octave so that the B on the staff is the lowest sounding note.  The resulting interval is a minor second.  To get from C to B you either need to ascend a Major th or descend a Minor nd.gt Does this mean that a major th CB which is  semitones is also a minor second which could technically be  semitones from C?Bolding that last part because I think youre misunderstanding something.  I think I covered most of it above but just to reiterate.   semitones is a major th.   semitone is a minor nd.  You will never have an interval that spans  semitones called a minor second.  Starting from C and moving down  semitones will create an interval that is a major th but your ending note with be Db not B.  You could also start from C and move up  semitone to get Db.If you have a C and a B separated by more than an octave it is safe to reduce the interval by subtracting octaves until it is easily nameable.  If you have a B that is  semitones above C you can safely call it a major th and not a major rd.  gt And how would you distinguish the two when talking about chords?You can invert chords.  Take a C major chord.  If you have it voiced CEG its in what we call root position because the root is in the bass.  You can invert it by moving the C up an octave so that you get EGC with E in the bass.  This is called first inversion.  You can invert it one more time by moving the E up an octave so G is in the bass.  This is called second inversion.  With th chords you can invert one more time for a third inversion.  The sound of the chord changes slightly because the intervals of the chord tones in relation to the bass note change but it is functionally the same chord.  Chords that contain extensions past the th arent inverted because you lose the identity of the chord.  Lets take an Emin chord.  EGBDF.  If you invert it you have GBDEF which could be a seen as a Gmajadd chord.  The tone cluster DEF is also very ambiguous and potentially messy sounding.  The chord as a whole doesnt look sound or want to resolve the way an Emin chord would.Chords and their inversions dont care about the relation of chord tones to each other for the most part they care about the relation of chord tones to the bass note.  I know I was talking about stacking thirds earlier but that is only useful for building root position chords and is just a stepping stone to get students familiar with the idea of concept of tertian harmony tertian meaning oror concerning thirds.  Once students get familiar spelling chords and internalize intervals figured bass is introduced and students get familiar with the intervals contained in chords and how they invert.A root position triad is the Root  the third of the chord  and the fifth of the chord .  Relevant to the bass you have B.  Easy enough.First inversion you move the root up an octave so chordtonewise  it is voiced .  Relevant to the base you have B.  A third when inverted becomes a th.  Major third becomes minor th and minor rd becomes major th.In second inversion you move the bass the third up an octave so the fifth is in the bass.  Chord tonewise its voiced .  Relevant to the bass its voiced B.  If youre working with a C major chord in first inversion it doesnt matter what octaves the G and C are voiced in they will always simplify down to being a minor third and minor th above the bass note E.So when notating a chord using chord symbols you can indicate its inversion by using a slash chord.  So a Cmaj in first inversion would be CmajE second inversion CmajG third CmajB.  If you really want the chord to be voiced so that the B and C create a minor second your best bet is to actually notate the exact chord voicing on the staff.  There isnt a way to indicate specific voicings using chord symbols to my knowledge.And I probably waaaaay overcomplicated this.  Hopefully I didnt confuse you more.,Guitar,csbp3mb,1,t5_2qi79
4312968,0,t3_3ae8ef,Okay so the reason your fingers are moving so far is because you are playing with too much tension.Place your fretting hand on the guitar with your fingers resting ever so slightly above the string on the th to th frets of the G string. Keep your thumb on the back on the neck roughly behind your middle finger and make sure you are only gently touching the neck with your thumb as opposed to pressing into it.Completely relax your hand make sure your wrist is straight and make sure your fingers are slightly curved except the index which should be fairly straight in order to mute the E and B strings. Now gently rest your index finger on the string keep using slightly more pressure until you can get a note to sound you should be picking the G string with your right hand. Now if youve done this correctly you shouldnt be using much tension at all to sound the note out.Now relax your index finger back to its original position this is how you unfret a note. You dont move your finger off the string you simply relax it back into the original position of slightly above the string. Repeat this with your middle ring and pinky finger very slowly and get comfortable with using barely any tension whatsoever to fret notes and simply relaxing your fingers to unfret the notes. Your fingers should feel relaxed while fretting the notes by the way its kinda hard at first to understand how youre meant to keep a note sounding while relaxing but keep trying and youll get it.Then you just have to practice very slowly at a speed slow enough that you can consciously fret and unfret notes this will be painfully slow at first and make sure you stay relaxed at all times when practicing. You should never force your fingers to stay near the fretboard they should naturally stay near the fretboard due to your hands being relaxed.You can do the JustinGuitar exercises if you want but make sure to keep the above in mind when doing them because forcing your fingers to do something with tension will harm your playing.

4383487,0,t3_3b7x08,Im a weekend guitar player but my day job is in biostatistics. I have a bachelors degree in biology plus masters degrees in biology and statistics. I work for a big government agency filled with PhD level biologists and medical doctors from all over the world. I think I can speak from experience when I say that marine biology is probably a less realistic career choice than professional musician.Most jobs in marine biology require a PhD and the job market for PhDs is very competitive. A marine biologist can work at a university a zoo an aquarium a water park eg SeaWorld a national park a state park or maybe the federal government eg EPA USDA .... That sounds like a lot of options but there are probably only a few hundred career level jobs in the world. The PhD level jobs are very competitive and if you do get the job you are looking at  hour weeks for the rest of your career. Lower level jobs at zoos and parks are also competitive because people love nature and animals. You might be competing for jobs against volunteers who work for free!  Seriously I know biology PhDs with good day jobs who volunteer at the zoo because ... animals. Its hard to get a job shoveling monkey shit at the zoo because some fool will probably do it for free. Plus governments are cutting funding for these types of jobs ALL the time because we need more tax cuts for billionaires.A career in medicine or molecular biology would be more practical but I advise undergraduates against it all the time. The good jobs require PhDs but tenure track jobs are being eliminated in favor of lengthier post docs and lower paying contract jobs. A biologist might spend  years of undergraduate studies  years of graduate study and  years of low paying post doc research only to end up with a career pieced together from temporary contract jobs through recruiting agencies like Kelly Scientific. The prospects are GRIM for lots of very smart people.To be fair the prospects in the music biz arent great either but at least they dont require a decade or more of school and training. Maybe your music really does suck. But crappy music makes money all the time eg Nickleback Pitbull .... Or maybe the audience for your music is a very tiny niche and its just unlikely youll be successful. You may need to adjust your musical goals to find a successful career but your gfs dream might be less realistic than yours. ,Guitar,csjr727,7,t5_2qi79

4404664,0,t3_3bgw5r,Heres what Ill tell you if you want to get session work  . Be able to play things right the first or second time. Artists will pay you to play but wont hire you again if you take too much studio time to track a part because that costs them money.  . Make sure you can sightread notation and comp and read changes.  . State your rates upfront be professional and have professional materials like business cards or a website or way of networking with people.  . Have gear that is high quality and versatile but also be able to tailor it to the session. The general rule of thumb is that every session player should have one guitar in each of these four categories A single coil guitar a humbucker guitar a guitar with a trem and a good acoustic. All these guitars should be professional quality because your clients will at least want to get the impression from the gear they are looking at that they will be getting a quality sounding recording. If youre doing a country session youll need a tele and a clean fender amp. But dont bring a squier or the people paying you will think in their mind Is this guy serious? no matter how good the guitar sounds.  As far as amps go Ive recorded in pro studios that have everything under the sun from vintage marshalls to dual recs to ACs to digital amp simulation available and Ive been to pro studios where they didnt have any guitar amps there This was a NICE studio where many famous records have been recorded.  Another way you get gigs is by being friends with the guys working at the studio. Be nice to the producer and the engineer and the interns and everybody. If somebody comes in looking to hire them to record something and needs a session player if they think highly of you and youre available you could get a call. ,Guitar,csm52hg,0,t5_2qi79

4405692,0,t3_3bfw86,Alternate pick! Its boring as shit i know  trust me but start off slow learning a song and gradually go a lil faster until you can play up to speed without messing up. Before you go faster make sure you can play it at a slower speed with out messing up. Start by just learning songs from bands you like. Also learn how to read tabs if you dont know how to already i dont know shit about drums . Also dont feel discouraged kick ass  and have fun. Also if you do decide on posting videos on the Internet for people to see how good you are or if youre doing a cover pretend you are playing in front of a crowd or the band that youre doing a cover of.

4408628,0,t1_csmcnuk,I have experience here. The only parts that I didnt have problems with were the tuners. Everything else was an uphill battle. Especially the bridge. The bridge that comes on that guitar is oddly shaped  its longer and narrower than a standard Tele bridge. I wanted to replace it with a vintage style and it didnt match up at all. I had to splice in wood in the pickup cavity and also had to drill out the body for the strings to go through. The control cavity and input jack areas were pretty much the same. I had to heavily modify it to get it to all work. Much more effort that what it was worth.Since this was a project for me and I intended on repainting it I didnt mind all that much. These new Indonesian Teles are made with basswood which I really like so for me it was worth it. Ill agree with UncleChichimus that they are on the bottom of the spectrum but with some fretwork these necks are pretty good  again after some effort. All in all I ended up with a really nice Telecaster after about  months of work over weekends. If you want to swap out parts and have them automatically fit with out much pain buy an MIM Tele. You can get one used for about  more than a new Affinity Tele.If I had to do it again I would totally buy a beat up MIM instead.,Guitar,csml5ed,2,t5_2qi79

4418271,0,t1_csnnaz8,gt  But on a singleended amp that obviously wont happen since the output section is always drawing roughly the same current. So he thinks he is getting a sound advantage that is not physically possible here. Even knowing this I still used a tube rec in my version of a champ. At the time my logic was that I could change the B voltage for a louder or quieter amp by swapping out a tube but I ended up preferring a AR anyway so I would have been better served with the solid state rec.EDIT for safety because this is guitar and not a DIY place If you have a F or E clone do not use a AR in it.

They are affordable and easy to mod. The absolute old stand by. Recommend z Cons But they are generic because they are so classic. They have become the most popular guitar design being copied by almost every brand. They also tend to be cheaper in the respect that you dont get to see set necks transparent finishes and wood grains as often.Pros Jazzmasters are a bigger fuller sounding Fender with a different tremolo system. They have many big difference and subtle features like the behind the bridge sounds bigger offset body comfort a different electronic system and the more offbeat look. Definitely a unique guitar and once set up and modded it separates its self in the Fender line up perfectly.Cons Good luck finding one though. Most people tend to keep theirs and when they do sell they fetch a more expensive price than the Strat. The Classic Players and other Mexican made ones differ quiet a bit in design and are thus less desirable for those looking for the true Jazzmaster sound and feel. Also enjoy learning about how to mod these as well the parts are much more expensive than Strat parts and almost absolutely necessary for playing modern times.Get the one you like better after playing them and then get the other later. I have all  body types and they do come in handy. The newer Jazzmaster models are probably great for modern rock so dont mark those off. Definitely try them too.,Guitar,cspnge8,2,t5_2qi79

The square cases offer more protection and stuff can be placed on top of them or they can be stacked etc. The gig bags are more convenient for when youre just going somewhere close by.

4485783,0,t3_3ciymi,The Standard series Made in Mexico goes for about  in Australia. You can get just about any configuration of Strat. The traditional SSS good for blues and classic rock HSS probably better for hard rock more variety in tone HSH or HH if you arent really interested in the classic Strat tones and just want something that can handle high levels of gain. The Blacktop series is a little cheaper. Around . The idea of those is that they are hotrodded versions of the classic models Strat Tele Jazzmaster ideal for heavy styles of playing.The Modern Player series is around the same price. Similar idea as the blacktop. Theyve taken the classic models and tweaked them to suit the modern player. Usually that means whacking a humbucker in and putting in jumbo frets. The Modern Player HSS Strat might be a good one to look at for a versatile rock guitar.Then youve got the Squier Classic Vibe range which is more like  and for a lot of peoples money better than the Mexican made Fenders. They are made in China like the Modern Players and are probably about equal in terms of quality. Youre not going to get a bridge humbucker but depending on what sort of rock you play you may not need one. A classic Strat plays rock really well obviously its been used on countless rock records. Id definitely have a look at the Classic Vibe Strats.Lastly theres the Squier Vintage Modified series. About  but Ive seen them even cheaper online as with all models. Thats where youll find a HSS Strat for that extra power in the bridge if you need it for heavier styles of playing. Might not be as good as the Classic Vibe but still decent.

Someone out there owns one and maybe they like it but these were thrown together from surplus parts and all the Bass V bodies they needed to get rid of because the Bass V itself was such a stupid idea. So what makes them the worse is the lack of care and planning. CBS ran Fender on the cheap and damn near ruined the company by the early s.Which leads me to that very instrument. The Bass V. The worlds first five string bass guitar. Only  frets plus a high C string instead of a low B. It was also ugly as shit. Again theres probably somebody out there with a Bass V who loves it.

4572599,0,t1_ct6qz8b,I am really not going to argue MIA vs MIM since it really does come down to budget and personal preference. I have personally played some really nice MIMs the Classic player series and the Jimmie Vaughan signature come to mind that I would gladly own alongside my MIA Standard. Hell I even owned a MIM classic s strat that I bought after already owning two American stratocasters. As such I dont really think I have those MIA only blinders on that you think I do.  That being said If you are going to get a MIM for the sake of using it as a upgrade platform you are probably going to end up replacing stuff like tuners bridges and the like eventually. My point was simply that a MIA will have solid hardware out of the box you wont need to upgrade any of it. especially if you get a Deluxe which has locking tuners stock.   When it comes to upgrading hardware going through a site like Guitar Fetish is going to pretty much get you what you started. Getting truly better parts is going to cost more.    Pickups come down to preference and what you specifically need. If you are looking for something pretty specific you will end up paying a bit extra for it. GFS does make some pickups but I have heard that like their other parts its hit or miss with them.   In the end if I had a choice between buying a MIM and upgrading or just getting a MIA used usually for  the price of a higher level MIM I would go for the MIA every time not because of the made in the USA on the headstock but because I know from a lot of experience that MIA hardware tends to hold tune better and requires less fuss.   ,Guitar,ct6zi7e,1,t5_2qi79

Play with your mid as you turn it up everything sounds fatter.  As you turn it down it gets tighter.  I palm mute until I like the machinegun chug.Then I start on the treble.   Neck pickup full guitar volume tone at .  Ill play some soloish stuff up high.  I just turn the Amp treble up till it approaches tinny and back it off a bit.Then I go to the bass.  Bridge pickup tone at  full guitar volume.  Ill alternate between a chug and a ringing power chord.  I turn it up till it starts to drown things out and back off again.Then I repeat the process using much finer adjustments.  I can set one up in about  seconds.  I have had on more than one occasion people write down my settings when I use their amps.Changing guitars sometimes requires a retweak.

The bass may be a bit lacking with perhaps a little improvement as the top opens up.  Mahogany can have a nice punchy sound for flatpicked lead lines but I dont love it for fingerstyle  doesnt bloom like spruce or have the warmth of cedar.Ive owned one Fender solidtop acoustic that sounded quiet  muted and one that sounded really rich and resonant.  A friend of mine plays a Sonoran thats closer to the second category.  I think its possible to find good Fender acoustics so try to play as many as you can.,Guitar,ctabi3t,1,t5_2qi79

In my memory it was a sunburst Strat but it could have been anything from a legit MIA Strat to a Squier to a cheapo no name knockoff. The color is the only thing Im reasonably sure of brand names meant nothing to me.  He let us play with it one time which involved me strumming strings while my friend fiddled with the amp knobs completely at random trying to get it to make sound. He must have had the volume jacked and then found the gain knob.  All we knew at the time was that the amp suddenly made a really loud terrible sound.

4669923,0,t3_3ex0mq,The Seymour Duncan JB Model works really well on Strats. I think it was designed to work with HSS configurations. Normally the humbucker sounds too dark with the k pots that are standard with single coils. But the JB works really well with k pots.For the single coils check out the SSL. They have a really high DC resistance so their output should match the bridge humbucker. In fact they have exactly the same DC resistance as the JB model. Thatd probably be a good set. I have my JB bridge paired with Fender Tex Mex single coils in the neck and middle. Their output is probably closer to the SSL pickups. So the humbucker is much louder. But I actually like that volume boost. And if I coilsplit the JB it pairs well with the single coils. Thats something you have to think about. Do you want the volume to be the even across all pickups? You usually have to decide between a humbucker that is close in output to the single coils or one that is about double the output so it matches well when you coilsplit it. I went for the latter.Also a reminder if you arent already aware you need to get a Trembucker rather than a humbucker so the strings line up with the pole pieces on the pickup. Most models should come in Trembucker versions.,Guitar,ctj72sm,3,t5_2qi79

4673442,0,t1_ctjl9lb,Thats the same way we lay our frets out at Dingwall  for the G  for the B.Imagine you decide to move your high E toward the middle of the neck at the nut without changing the saddle location.  The scale length grows a bit due to the nut angle.  Accordingly every fret will now need to be slightly further from the bridge in order to be in the correct spot and at first glance the fan of the frets accomplishes this.  Unfortunately once you get past your perpendicular fret theyre angled the other way... and as a result those frets get Closer to the saddles.In the end moving the treble strings inboard causes slight flatness below the perpendicular fret and sharpness above the perpendicular fret growing particularly out of tune by the time you reach the top of your neck.  Vice versa for the bass strings as theyre moved toward the center of the neck.We made this mistake and by the time you got to the th fret on the high G string it was almost a quarter tone sharp.  It was rank.  Just because we moved the G string over a couple mm further from the necks edge.,Guitar,ctjmzlk,1,t5_2qi79

In either case you are practicing to a perfect timing sequence that doesnt make mistakes  its just that one is more colorful in my opinion.  I think I understand where you coming from as far as the backing track creatively confining you to a particular flavor genre or mode etc but you must still come up with the sequence speed dynamics etc of each note on your own and that all forcing creativity just as the metronome would.  Selecting different backing tracks and at different speeds that fit your genre makes it fun and makes me sometimes play for hours.  But nevertheless its probably not a great idea to completely ignore metronome practice as it will really make your mistakes stand out more as there is less distraction in the background to drown out your slight mistakes.  Just to me its difficult to practice very long to only a metronome so I get more bang for my buck practicing to backing tracks.  I also play drums so Ive spent countless hours playing to a metronome or click track so I guess Im taking my sense of time for granted.   ,Guitar,ctq5nyi,1,t5_2qi79

4735081,0,t3_3fpph9,First and foremost the famous guitarists you list all have had or currently are using pretty sophisticated setups. Gilmour has never stopped using his Pete Cornish control boards Clapton used a very large rig in the s and Fripp practically built his career around using interesting and sophisticated effects.  On top of that you only see a fraction of what these guys own when they go on stage. Guys like Page have shelves of guitars on standby. Heck even Clapton had two different auctions where he sold a ton of gear. I have no doubt that he still continues to collect guitars amps and other gear to this day.  The real issue is that you are applying your specific situation to everyone else. You may find that a  guitar a  amp and a couple of pedals is enough to get the sound that you specifically require but others wont share that. We all have different requirements different sounds that we are looking to achieve. Some of us can get those sounds with a minimalistic rig while others will find that impossible. After all no amount of skill on the guitar can magically get you a delay sound or even some of the more complicated synth like effects that some players make excellent use of.  Your post sets up a strawman. the player that is more interested in gadgets than actually playing. The player that thinks that gear can replace and make up for lack of skill and knowledge. These players do exist but they are going to be that way no matter what gear they have. These kinds of people are intellectually lazy and wont change if they have either a  Squier or a  Collings in their hands. The other issue is the fact that this is a discussion board about guitar in general. Its difficult to talk about playing but it is very easy to talk about gear. Its just the way text based forums work. We have some playing and music specific guitar subreddits here but this one is naturally going to catch the gear related stuff more often than not. It makes sense and I dont really mind it myself.  Now on to your specific questions.gt So Im wondering how much you guys have spent on gear and if you regret it or still manage to actually use it all.  I dont have a ton of money to spend on gear at any one time. I have to plan my purchases very carefully and as such I tend to only get things that I am really going to use. At one point I did have a rather large and expensive setup with many guitars effects and a couple of good amps. That rig did not prevent me from practicing. The act of going to the store to buy a new pedal did not prevent me from spending time practicing or learning new music theory stuff that I did not know.  Right now I have a very small rig but I have also carefully planned out the stuff that I need to make that rig complete. I dont have much to get but planning that did not take away from my practice time nor did researching the gear itself.gt Has upgrading gear made you a better guitarist?  This is a bit of a loaded question but I will bite none the less.  I had a period where I lost all my gear due to a crappy situation. There was a period of about two and a half years or so where I had nothing. Later I was able to get my hands on a second hand strat knockoff and a Mustang II amp. It was good enough for a while but I really really disliked the feel of the guitar even after properly setting it up. It did not help that I generally hated how it sounded.  I was stuck with that rig for a good while but when I was able to get a American strat and my Egnater amp it was like coming home. I was not only more willing to play them but also was able to get the feel and sound I was looking for. I was back in a place where I could worry less about getting a guitar that did not frustrate me and get back to work on the music.  So yes upgrading made me a better player.gtHas it let you write more songs better songs innovative songs?   You should ask Hendrix that perhaps even Gilmour. When I had a big rig with a bunch of guitars I found that every guitar had its own voice its own thing that it wanted me to do. Each guitars sound would inspire me to find ways to really make best use of it.   Effects and amps are probably a bigger deal in this regard. Playing with a strat plugged straight into a Twin or a Bassman will push me to play differently than running a guitar into some modulation and and delay pedals and then into a more modern sounding amp. All those effects give you more sounds to put in your creative toolbox. Just plugging in a delay often drives me to make up interesting rhythm parts.gtHas it made you more picky and obsessive over your equipment?  Picky and obsessive are two very different things. I think its important that you understand that.   As I said before I dont have a ton of money that I can spend on gear so I have to be very picky. I will always try to get the best I can get with the budget I have to work with. This means that I will always save up a bit and get the higher quality piece of gear when I can help it or when it makes a difference for my purposes. I dont go crazy with pedals but I will always be picky with guitars and amps because I know what I like and if that stuff is expensive I will save up because its worth it for me.  Being obsessive is a entirely different thing. I seriously doubt that as many people are as obsessive as you seem to believe.gtJust curious about everyones opinion. Everyone here can pretend to be The Edge or Steve Vai but isnt it more fun to be like Cobain Neil Young Page Clapton and the like who are defined by their writing capabilities amp creativity rather than their tone?  This is not a black and white thing. You do not make some sort of silly arbitrary choice between being a great guitarists and a great songwriter. You will find that guys on your list like Clapton and Page fall somewhere in the middle sometimes they are more on one end or the other depending on the album or song in question.  If having a lot of gear distracts you then that is your problem. It does not mean that everyone else has that problem. I myself and many others I observe posting here seem to have no problem balancing the gear with the creativity and learning.        ,Guitar,ctreed7,3,t5_2qi79

4751566,0,t3_3fu2i3,I fully understand. I would say I am a guitar player. Why? I own  of the bastards. Am I any good? Mediocre at best. I hate playing in front of people apart from my girlfriend whom I live with so no choice really. Ive got a pedal board with  or  pedals I cant recall the exact amount and I built that myself out of pure joy. Im nearly  its probably the only hobby I actually have and I find playing modifying and learning about guitars very interesting. To a beginner I look good to someone who can actually play I look awful.When I was in Afghanistan a music shop in England kindly sent a brand new acoustic guitar to someone whom I shared a tent with and I took the time to teach some guys the billy basics and to them I looked like a guitar legend but thankfully no one else could play to correct me with whatever I would have been getting wrong.But I can safely say I HATE playing in guitar shops. If I like or want something I take a gamble I buy it online because I cant stand being judged by other players in shops and I feel I dont belong or deserve to be called a guitarist because of the culture of people who are good which they probably rightly deserve to be called but think theyre a fucking rock god or they invented music just because they know more licks than I do.,Guitar,cttha43,2,t5_2qi79

Your Rich doesnt seem like it has a really thick top so I think normals would work in there too. Remember that EMG solderless set takes a lot of place in cavity due to PCB and battery. Of course you can adapt long shafts for your guitar but later you can find it hard to close it in your cavity.

The original is a basically the same thing but made in Germany as opposed to SE Asia and uses higher quality metal. They are  usually. But those are the original badass first of its kind Floyd.

4937158,0,t1_cugb45f,The modes could help the point is how they work in context I think allot of people get caught up in the theory of modes if you are then maybe you need to look at them a different way as I said whats most important is how they function. Like a previous poster said focus on chord tones thats basically what using modes will effectively do. To make it more clear it might be useful to take a chord progression that is not exclusively diatonic look at the nondiatonic chord and figure out from which scale it comes from which degree of the scale is the root and use that mode to play over it. Maybe another trick to try to get your ear attuned and actually probably a better one to do first is to play a mode but not on its own with no backing as you said like this its hard to get out of the idea that you just playing a normal major or minor scale instead have the corresponding chord underneath on a loop. For example play a Dm or Dm chord on a loop and over the top start jamming using D Dorian scale your sure to hear a difference when compared to the A natural minor Aeolian over an Am chord or C major Ionian over a Cmaj chord and you should naturally be coming to rest on a D rather than a C or an A as you would in the key of Cmaj or Am you can continue this with the different modes in different keys.... ,Guitar,cugv9ks,1,t5_2qi79

4942261,0,t3_3iklec,No one can nail the sounds from the record not even Johnny Marr himself. Marr has said as much in interviews. But remember that there are at least two distinct guitar lines probably  in different places.The main rhythm guitar line just uses distortion and tremolo. Youll need a fairly aggressive tremolo sound lots of depth and a hard square or triangle wave. On the recording Marr used the tremolo effect from two different amps which is why the tremolo effect on the album isnt perfectly in time and its impossible to nail .There are also several lead guitar lines over the tremolo part. notably the two note transition with delay and reverse reverb that occurs right before the drums and again when Moz songs ... of a shyness that is criminally vulgar. Then there is the little octave riff during the chorus ...shut your mouth how can you say I go about things the wrong way which has a little distortion and plenty of reverb. Finally there is a little single note run ie ddit ddit dditduhn after the chorus ends. Most of the lead guitar parts are variations on these  basic parts. ,Guitar,cuhif3t,3,t5_2qi79

5003349,0,t3_3jfuv6,What youre looking at with his signature model is not a locking or floating tremolo i.e. the ones you may be afraid of in regards to tuning. Its similar to that of a strat tremolo where the whammy bar is used for mostly vibrato and such. With these tremolos you dont really have to adjust anything to change tunings and you can tune it simply using well the tuners on the headstock.As I mentioned before the tremolos you are thinking of which are somewhat difficult to tune are locking tremolos such as the Floyd Rose or the slightly less popular Kahler. Heres an example of a Les Paul equipped with a Floyd Rose instead of its standard hard tail Notice the locking nut. The reason you cant change tunings on the fly with these guitars is because once you are in tune whether it be standard drop D or whatever you fasten the nut down on to the strings and it locks on to them. This allows you to use the whammy bar in ridiculous ways without the strings going out of tune. The strings will also stay in tune for a very long time. The pros and cons of Floyd Roses are debated because on one hand you can do some cool shit with them and your strings almost never go out of tune and on the other they are kind of a pain in the ass to set up restring and even tune. Anyways you can look them up if you want more information but as far as this guitar goes you wont have to worry about it because that bridge works almost the same as any hard tail except with a whammy bar.,Guitar,cup3afk,2,t5_2qi79

Im a beginner guitarist been on and off for years though so not beginner beginner and Ive been learning some basic theory from Fake Dr. Levin along with Justin Guitar lessons. Love both these guys but Im stuck in one of the music theory lessons somewhere between intervals and chord naming. I guess my basic question is what exactly should I know along with what major and minor scales are their formulas wwhwwwh and whwwhww and the names of the intervals? What do I need to be practicing with this knowledge? Since Im following Levins video series he hasnt gotten into putting scales or intervals into guitar much yet.So my process would be ok D major painstakingly count out one by one DEFGABC I had to do it just now find each note on a single string intervals would take me a long time to find because I still find them confusing. I tried doing the chord naming lesson and I immediately got lost trying to find triads in a scale or notes in a triad.

5082102,0,t1_cux8v3c,On some levels you are right. A amp is going to be the most obvious contribution to your sound. At the same time a amp can only do so much with what it is given.   For example. I have often heard people say that one can use amp EQ to make one guitar or one set of pickups sound like another. The insinuation is that the people who carefully choose guitars and pickups are generally cork sniffers who are more concerned about gear than learning how to use their gear.  Now I had a set of Fender Hot noiseless pickups in my Stratocaster. I spent almost a entire year trying to get them to sound less midrangy less like a humbucker in disguise. I was looking for that signature Stratocaster quack that comes so easily with most normal alnico single coils.   Sadly despite some telling me that I could just mess with the EQ and that would get it there It was really not possible. The guitar was simply not providing the sound I wanted and the amp was not magically going to deliver it.  When I did finally put a set of Fender s in the guitar it was immediately better. even though the s were cheaper at the time so price was not a factor in my opinion. I immediately was able to get that quack that I was looking for without any significant messing about with the EQ.  It was almost as if the amp can only really work with what it is given.,Guitar,cuyl4b3,1,t5_2qi79

5101117,0,t3_3ksr41,I put an add a year ago on CL. I got a call from a guy that wanted to do a pop rock band and I was interested for the experience of playing in a band since it had been  a long time since I had played with a group. Im was  and these guys where in their late s. The singer had a  year old daughter that was sleeping but I guess she didnt mind we where all playing super loud. Long story short none of them knew music so playing was a bit difficult. The bassist then tells me around the end of the sesh that he has just gotten out of jail so this was the only job he could get for while they already had small shows lined up  incredible. The drummer late s early s lived  hours away. They tell me this after our hour practice. Also telling me how we will take one car to his house to not waste gas. Honestly they where okay musicians and nice guys. However the age difference their lack of musical knowledge the hr drive to practice and the fact that they where very new to their instruments was the reason i choose to not pursue it. If you wanna start a band bro you gotta talk to people and get to know them first. Its foolish to meet up with a stranger and think youre going to form the Beatles. Here is a questionnaire for potential band members musical taste have you been in jail age gear pics basic musical knowledge schedule do they live far etc etc. ,Guitar,cv0vi6i,1,t5_2qi79

Then there was the Target deal and the insane number of soundtracks BoH has been featured on. As the sole songwriter he would be getting a good payday from those. If he had decent investments hes doing OK. Im guessing the other guys basically get paid as hired hands though.

I bought a cheap one Mighty Mite to replace the neck in my beloved old Jazz Bass and still paid over  and then had to finish the wood.  And its still not a Fender because I didnt want to pay  for a replacement neck for a  bass.

5139941,0,t3_3lcbfm,Just looking at it the things I can see lowering the price are Satin Finished generally considered lower quality finish than the high gloss on most guitars Grover instead of Kluson deluxe tuners  No binding. Real not just painted on binding takes a long ass time and costs a lot No fretboard inlays No pickup ring No cap or ring on the toggle switchHeres the Gary Moore Standard for comparison. So most of the differences are cosmetic which is actually a good thing imo. The  functional differences are that instead of the traditional  humbuckers and  volume tone knobs the bfg has a p in the neck and a kill switch in the place of one of the tone knobs. It doesnt necessarily make it worse just different and therefor not Standard.And of course the standard has more expensive pickups. Whether they sound better or not is up to you of course but its still a difference and a sonic one at that. The ones in the BFG are a bit hotter.Standard Bridge NeckBFG Bridge Neck Just to clarify Im not actually entirely sure if this is the same p that they put into the guitar or if they just tossed some generic one in there.FWIW I think the BFG would be pretty cool to own if you already own a regular Les Paul.

5214211,0,t3_3mf84t,Pretty hard to say man.  There are a lot of factors at hand.  First off DO NOT GO TO GUITAR CENTER.  They will RAPE you on a repair.  In my town theres a big guy and a little guy and they both do a pretty good job for cheaper than GC and the little guy will be extremely honest encourage you to fix stuff on your own and explain exactly what needs to be done vs. the full fix up.Its also hard to say what damage there is without a description.  It looks like the biggest thing it needs is just a new pickgaurd which are usually around  dollars if I recall correctly.  The blemish it has doesnt really need to be fixed and even if you or a pro paints it over its gonna be tough to really cover it up .  My guitar got its whole jack rippee out and has  chunks out of it but I fixed the jack and it still plays the same.  Actually I guess the bigger thing it needs is another set of humbuckers because that guitar always has two sets.  I think those are usually anywhere between  depending on quality.Other than that theres a million little things that can be done and a lot of t can be done by you.  NEVER pay someone for setup.  If you can do dishes drive a car you can learn to set up your guitar.  That means restringing intonation action bridge adjustment etc.  Use youtube you will be happy you learned because its a preference thing only you can do.  Something you might want to look into one day is refretting as in completely taking out all the frets and replacing them.  You will want to hire someone for this and it is very costly.  If you ever do this to any guitar make sure you refret with steel frets.  Its usually  dollars more expensive for stell but they will last  years vs regular frets only lasted me  months of vigorous playing.  They get worn down eventually.Just remember its  you and your fingers touch and musical knowledge that makes for good tone and sound.  You want a functioning instrument but almost any instrument when set up correctly can have at least decent sound.  So focus on the music not the gear it seems now more than ever its like people buy a guitar like they buy a big screen.,Guitar,cvei7qh,1,t5_2qi79

5230979,0,t3_3mndfo,If youre specifically looking for jazz guitar stuff a few of my favorite jazz guitar albums are Smokin at the Half Note by Wes Montgomery Idle Moments by Grant Green and Undercurrent by Jim Hall with Bill Evans. If youre open to stuff without guitarists I would recommend listening to Wayne Shorters Speak No Evil John Coltranes Giant Steps and Workin With the Miles Davis Quintet. Obviously there are many more albums than those Ive listed but these are simply my suggestions as a starting place that are somewhat stylistically comparable to Kind of Blue. Jazz is a very broad genre with a lot of variety so it would be worth exploring the different categories and eras to find what you like. Good luck and happy listening!,Guitar,cvgivo9,2,t5_2qi79

Cost to buy one off the rack is quite high   to   but the cost to build one is only  so long as youre reasonably handy with a soldering iron. Its only  components that need to be connected anyway  an appropriate Lpad for your amp and speaker a pair of  jacks a switch and cap to wire up a bright switch and minimize tone suck. Thats it. Ive got the parts coming in for mine later today. Figure itll take an hours worth of soldering.

5297240,0,t3_3njmr3,None of those people would have written perfect songs from when they were learning.  None of those people when they started learning would have written a full complete hit song on par of the greats.gt I have never written a full complete song.Ultimately this is a problem how can you expect to write good songs if you never finish a song?  Its like wanting to be a racing driver you expect a certain level so every time you go out to practice a race you crash in the first lap because youre not Michael Schumacher and the other  laps go unraced. gt you cant learn to become a racing driver in this way.The song writing process  learning process is not write song gt good write next song gt better.  The song process  learning is all about rewriting it should really be called song rewriting.So to take the analogy on the way a racing driver learns is he goes slow gt completes his first lap.  He then repeats it  times gt completes a race.  Sure he was slow but he finished.  He can then look at his racing technique maybe change the line he takes through a corner or learns where he can push more and do so knowing he wont crash because hes been there already gt does another race and is a little bit faster.  Still not Schumacher but at least hes getting there.Song writing the process is similar.  Write a song gt critique whats good  bad gt find ways to improve gt rewrite part of the song gt critique gt find ways to improve gt critique gt rewrite gt critique gt rewrite gt critique gt rewrite etc.  At first yeah your songs arnt great and they may take a while to complete but the more you do the more lessons you learn and the more your rewrites will improve it gt the more experience you get the better quality your next song will start off from.So yeah dont take it to hard that song  part song is literally the first step in a marathon you just need to run the rest.So rewriting  improving a first draft song is a crucial.  This ultimately falls into  song crafting and really its an art in songwriting just like playing a piano or guitar song crafting is a skill that needs to be worked upon.A book Id recommend is the Songcrafters colouring book it has a nice idea about hats you have a creative hat you put on to generate song material.  You then need to take that hat off and put your more analytical hat on to start crafting a song.  To take a rough diamond and polish it up.There are many books on songwriting and many worth reading.  I would try a find the ones that discuss songwriting rather than a technical manual on how to songwrite.  Its a very wiffely waffely subject.  Just go into amazon and google songwriting song crafting and buy like  books gt read them all.editA few things really helped my songwriting  learning to sing gt not only useful as a tool but also the study of vocal melodies over the songs I learnt and how they worked with the backing really changed my appreciation of the guitars role in it.  Getting out  I was busy work jobcarreer etc and unsurprisingly didnt have much of a life  voice to write with so I took some holidays traveled saw some art n shit spoke to random people in queues gave my heart  had it broken etc gt all life experience that makes songs.  Essentially learned to live and look at life in general in a different way.  Even something as stupid as stopping and watching a sunset its an obvious beauty in the world but where I work most people just walk over the bridge to catch the train home and miss it.  But if I was missing something so obvious what else am I missing in the world that isnt so obvious but is something to write about?  Look at art in general photography gt how the artist can see  capture a moment similar with painters how they can see something in something gt bring it to life on canvas.  Likwise songwriters how they can take see and take something most people either dont see or take for granted and turn it into something.   In the vein above what was I missing I carry around a small book now to jot song ideas or lyrics.  And not just ideas for example youve had a stressful day but for a moment you see a sunset and the way it splashed through a tree and suddenly your thoughts went quite and you feel everythings gonna be ok gt jot down how you felt in that moment what it was about the scene that made you feel that way. gt helps you remember it and get in the moment later when youre with youre guitar.  Ok this may be more on the arsty side of things but that essence of connection is just as important as songs still need to connect with people even even songs like baby got back or for those about to rock. potentially stupid in premise but they do capture  convey something in a way someone finds interesting.  Reading.  Kinda helps with the point above but also helps in terms of general language skills i.e. knowing a few different words  ways to say the sky is blue can help you better fit a lyric to work together especially onm crafting  rewrites as you can see where lyrics are good  bad and you can try to improve them  Reading books about songwriting as I said just before more about approaches than technical manuals  Learning some cliched songwriting themes themes work e.g. about love loss etc but the trick is to express them in a different way from any of the million tried and tested clichesAnother book Id hugely recommend is Victor Wootens book The Music Lesson.

5319731,0,t1_cvr3hon,the threads of the screws or the head? either way I dont think that is normal. if its the heads I guess its not that big of a deal just make sure the new screws have the same thread pitch. the screws usually dont have a ton of tension so I dont see how the head would strip unless the screws were super low quality soft metal like chinese pot metal. if its the threads that are bad...yikes. I would be worried that youd need bigger screws to get grip and new screws might just chew up the inside of the body more and there would be nothing left for the screw to hold onto. that might be a disaster because I imagine the thing you would have to do to fix that if that happened would be to fill the holes up with some kind of filler and make new screw holes. im no expert so you might see if rluthier has anything to say about it before you jump into the project. depending on the issue I might have a luthier do the repair.good luck man!,Guitar,cvrnoxq,1,t5_2qi79

Friends have even come over and played after a night of drinking at am. We couldnt do that with my Marshall and an acoustic kit wo the police being called. The amp is awesome in every way for what it is and the interface is really useful for tweaking things.,Guitar,cvs6jeb,1,t5_2qi79

Not sure how it happenedChanging Floyd strings takes quite a bit of time. Its not like changing acoustic strings in about about  mins or so.. Its changing them and tuning the guitar about  times stretching the strings setting the springs tuning another  times finally locking the nut because you think its good but its really not loosening the nut adjusting the fine tuners tuning the headstock again adjusting the springs one last time check the fine tuners again locking the nut then fine tuning one last time. Floyds are a lot of fun! But a serious pain in the dick to maintain. You have to really like Floyds! Get one and see how you like it I sure loved mine when I had it!

Some people need them or at least thats the configuration they choose to go with.Live Slash uses nothing but Les Pauls except for for a couple tunes he uses and old B.C. Rich Mockingbird ST on. He uses certain Les Pauls for certain songs but he also wants to be able to have a guitar that feels and sounds the same as the one he hands off if he has to for a broken string or other problem.I load my boats with two identical Ibanez models one main one backup two identical Jacksons one main one backup and anywhere from two to four Les Pauls. Do I have more than one of every guitar I own? No because that wouldnt be fair to all the other guitars out there that need me to own them.But you know what? Fuck all that bullshit. Who cares why Slash or me or Paul Gilbert or Petrucci uses what they use. The important part is that you acquire more guitars.Who cares if its the same model of a guitars you already have? Its a fucking guitar isnt it? That means you must have it.Say you have  ESP s. Now say something happens to fifteen of them one day.

5343778,0,t3_3o52ht,If youre looking for an inexpensive way to get better quality recordings I recommend the Zoom Q.  I think its about  will take p video and records bitk audio with a pair of small condenser mics on top of the camera.  Zooms known for making quality field recorders they just made one that can take HD video too.   Now with those specs and that price there are a few drawbacks the battery doesnt last very long poor video quality in low light the mics are SENSITIVE and will pick up handling noise get a tripod doesnt matter if its nice and you will also need an SD card.  Still its the perfect thing for a video like this itll capture a clear image of the room sound and simultaneously give you a high quality video to go with it.  That way you dont have to record the audio and video with separate devices and sync them later to get a quality end product just gotta hit record and go.With all that said fantastic job on the solo you really nailed the guitar tone and all the bends.

5390704,0,t3_3ov838,No opinions on the Twin specifically but heres my p.  Dont buy an amp that doesnt work if you arent an EE or experienced in tube amp debugging.  Its not worth your time and you will regret it.  If however its just old you very well may be fine.  If it works but they claim it sounds a little weird I would be on the fence.  That kind of thing often is fixable by swapping out a couple blownblowing capacitors easy to tell by looking and new tubes.There is nothing inherent to PCB that makes it worse than something else.  You can make shitty PCB and amazing PCB circuits just like with point to point.  PCB is serviceable maybe even more so tbh as long as you know what you are doing which is a requirement for sticking any appendage inside an amp.If you want an amp that sounds like a Fender Twin either working option should be ok.  Im not sure what the common problems are with old twins hopefully others can chime in there but if you are able to hear before you buy I think you are quite safe.

No. If you get a Squier Strat not Bullet or Affinity with the same fingerboard and put in the YJM pickups and most importantly the YJM Speed Pots they will sound pretty much the same. I would also suggest fitting the Yngwie Brass nut  on Amazon and Fender brand  on Amazon locking tuners while you are it. Then get yourself a FretGuru file or two and roll the edges of the fretboard and dress the fret ends.

A Squier Classic Vibe s Strat would be my recommendation. If youve got more to spend obviously look at the Mexican and American Fenders too try them out and see which one you like more.For the amp Id recommend something like a Fender Mustang for home use. You dont need to buy additional pedals because it has effects built in. It also models a bunch of famous amps. So its a great beginner amp for home use to play around with and find what sort of effects and amp models you like the best. You can also play through headphones with it which mutes the speaker.

5548818,0,t3_3r3pwj,Does it matter? You got it for  and its a s MIM. If the previous owner replaced the body thats not a real worry. Its not like they replaced the body on a  Strat. I wouldnt be too concerned about how genuine the parts are. Maybe the new parts like the pickups or body if they even have been replaced are an upgrade. As for staying in tune Strats do have more difficulty staying in tune than say Teles because of the tremolo bridge. Unless you hardtail it by jamming a block of wood behind the tremolo you will experience some tuning issues because the tension of one strings effects the tension of all the other strings. As with any guitar lubricate the nut and saddles. A graphite pencil works. White lithium grease works. Anything like that. Make sure your tuning peg windings are nice and clean. No overlaps. Each wind goes neatly under the previous one. And make sure your guitar is set up properly. A small amount but not too much of neck relief. Fairly low nut action strings too high at the first fret will cause bad intonation when you press down the strings. Nicely levelled and crowned frets. Set the action low to medium. Because again if its too high the intonation will be off when you press down the strings. And of course set the intonation using the saddle screws. Check the pickup height too. Pickups too close to the strings can pull them out of tune.,Guitar,cwkvrqu,2,t5_2qi79

Whats your budget?If you want something that will be fun to fiddle around with that can produce many different sounds the Fender Mustang series is cool and the smallest one is around  here in the states.  I would recommend that over the Line  spider  purely because there are so many more options for the same amount of money and my opinion is that the Mustang sounds better overall.  At each price point in the Mustang series I think theyre the best option for a digital modeling amp.  When I was selling this stuff I usually only recommended the Spider to people who expressed annoyance or disinterest in having lots of options.If you dont need that type of flexibility and would like to focus on an amp that actually sounds good and illuminates the sound of the instrument rather than masking it with digital manipulation then there are a number of small tube amps that Id recommend based on your price range...

The neck might have back bow the truss rod is overtightened or the frets are already chewed up and they are not level.But in your case unless I bend the string slightly upwards I think the neck is still straight or have some relief and my guess is that you have frets that are not level anymore.  years of playing does take its toll on the frets.My advice is to take it to a tech and ask for fretleveling and general setup work.

5604732,0,t3_3rw2a5,I usually recommend a practice session broken into three moreorless equal parts.  The first part is warmup this includes scales arpeggios and other technical exercises.  Learning new scales and patterns is part of this section as well although the process will likely be slower in the beginning.  Learn and assimilate a new scale every week.  The second part is for new music any song or part of a song that has not yet been learned and by learned I mean memorized andor completely playable at tempo with no obvious errors.  The third part is review or revision of previously learned material this is the fun part of practicing the part where you really get to play.In order to know what you should be covering you must establish a goal or set of goals the more specific the better ie. I want to learn Crazy Train all the way through by March th  not I want to learn to play a few songs.  Then examine the goal and break it down into smaller goals what chords techniques patterns etc. do you need to learnmaster to be able to reach your goal.  Then divide each of those goals into smaller goals until you have daily attainable goals that all lead toward a bigger one.  It helps to make a journal and write this stuff down in the beginning.  Even if you dont reach a goal you have specified youll be much closer to it than if you hadnt.   minutes is about the bare minimum I would suggest for practice its ok in the beginning but youll eventually have more material than you can fit in the time.

Rather than rocking and stressing the studs and bridge material the JMJag vibrato is free to move. Your opinion is your opinion Im just stating facts. Even a pinned bridge on a Gretsch will rock the pins just keep it fixed from sliding around the guitar. But this misinformation is why they can build a pretty healthy industry around roller bridges and graphite saddles while good for the nut and string sliding action there the benefit of graphite saddles is greater to string longevitypreventin snagging and snapping on a microscopic level rather than large movements via vibrato use.,Guitar,cwwkv6l,1,t5_2qi79

5646229,0,t1_cwwrv6y,The poster who said that the idea of kids age  learning instruments was hysterical is just plain wrong. True not all kids will show aptitude or interest in music just like not all adults are into it. But its never too early to start a musical education. I know that some  year olds can learn just fine because when I was around that age my class in school had a talent show and a girl played guitar. y.o. might be a little young for technical instrument lessons but if you can find a good early childhood music class usually these incorporate a keyboard that focuses on play rather than playing it can be helpful if your kid eventually wants to learn an instrument. My parents took me to a Yamaha music class when I was very young. We learned a tiny bit of piano but mostly the class focused on singing and games. Through that class I had a basic grasp of rhythm pitch scales and even chord progressions before I was ! Of course I couldnt explain any of that stuff technically back then but years later when I decided to be more serious about music I could bypass some of the early theory stuff because I knew it already and just needed to put names to them. So contrary to the belief of some little kids can learn instruments. Kids these days can figure out video games and they use computers better then most of us. Its lunacy to suggest that you cant introduce them to music. The only thing I would be careful about is to not browbeat your kids into it. I know people whose parents forced them to practice hours a day when they were young so that they could play in piano competitions before they even graduated elementary school. Some of these kids became excellent musicians others just resented their parents and dont play anymore not even for personal enjoyment. So be careful there.,Guitar,cwwywir,2,t5_2qi79

If one hand is weaker or in anyway less worked out the overall rhythm will suffer.  The strokes will be uneven one hand will be able to play certain rhythms while the other cannot and dynamics will be uneven.The guitar being a rhythmic musical instrument does not differ in this regard even though the hands are doing two different things.  In fact you could argue that the guitar is actually a percussive instrument in that both the timing of the picking hand and the fretting hand are what matters.  You hit the strings with both hands in a rhythmic way though in different places and in different ways.Ultimately musicians should strive for ambidexterity.,Guitar,cx56v2g,1,t5_2qi79

Ritchie Blackmore disliked using any effects pedals preferring to go directly into his Marshall stack. I personally think that an effects pedal can only model so much about a tube amps overdrive  distortion. My long term goal is to get a nice Marshall or Vox tube amp but realistically thats a long way away.

5817696,0,t1_cxggwwn,Honestly youre overthinking it.  percent of the sound of an electric guitar is the pickups  pecent is your fingerpick technique and the remaining  is everything else about the guitar mostly the bridgenut and potswiring. When you add an amp thats about  the tone too. The body shape is one of least significant factors in the tone of an electric guitar.Yes a semihollow will sound slightly different  but not really that different and itll feedback more easily. Theyre also more delicate and harder to maintain.Any decent wellsetup and maintained electric guitar will do just fine. Your primary considerations should be A that the neckfretsnutbridge are in the best possible shape B your pickupswiring and tuning machines arent cheapass and C the guitar is comfortable to hold and not too heavy. Pretty much everything else is almost irrelevant when it comes down to the playability and tone of an electric guitar.,Guitar,cxi8mw7,1,t5_2qi79

5854409,0,t1_cxm2vkx,From a gear perspective...I honestly think a large part of it is the image. So Marshall could be hard rock while Blackstar is metal even though Blackstar is heavily based on the Marshall sound. Or Les Pauls are hard rock while ESP is metal.In terms of sound or equipment when people say that gear is for metal I think they usually mean heavier metal E.G. death metal probably metalcore. This usually implies drop tunings extended range guitars which need pickups with greater clarity or output such as active EMGs and a lot of distortion hence the tendency to go for high gain orientated amps.Edit of course having said this feel free to use whatever you like for whatever you play! Jim root gets along just fine with his Orange amp and many metal players use Les Pauls or even Telecasters these days.,Guitar,cxn1hxu,1,t5_2qi79

If he wasnt completely in love with his guitar Id feel totally fine giving him a surprise one even though people around this sub dont think thats ever a good idea.

5880906,0,t3_3vtgmj,A scale is a collection of notes. What seperates different kinds of scales major natural minor minor pentatonic etc. from each other is the intervals between the individual notes of a scale as well as the amount of notes a scale contains.They are created by taking a root note of your choice and then finding notes that fit these intervals. For these intervals it is common to use the terms semitoneS which equals going  halfstep or  fret on the guitar and toneT which equals  halfsteps or  frets. A scale is then created from a certain series oftones and semitones.Keep in mind though that scales can also use intervals that are larger than a tone but this is a little less common.Lets take the C major scale for example.A major scale uses this series of Tones and Semitones TTSTTTS. It dosent matter what your root note is you always have to use this formula.The C simply means that you build this scale from the note C. As you can see the first interval is a tone so we have to go up a tone from the note C which gives us the note D. Now we need to go up another tone which gives us an E. Next we have to go up a semitone which gives us an F etc.If apply the entire series of tones and semitones you should end up with this scaleC D E F G A B CThis is what is known as a C major scale because it is built from the note C and it uses a specific series of tones and semitones.You can do the same with the natural minor scale but the natural minor scale uses a different combination of tones and semitones TSTTSTT.Major and minor scales are sometimes referred to as heptatonic scales which means that they use  individual notes.A pentatonic scale uses five individual notes instead. Lets quickly compare a C major scale with a C pentatonic major scaleC major C D E F G A B CC pentatonic major C D E G A CAs you can see the C pentatonic major scale uses notes that can also be found in the C major scale but it also leaves out some notes.,Guitar,cxqiphe,2,t5_2qi79

After I found that out I was told that I could never do watersports contact sports or sports with strong chances of injury ever again. This was a pain in the arse considering that my favourite sports were rugby kickboxing mma and surfing and doesnt really matter now but I was good at rugby I coulda been on track to go far with it.I was pretty depressed at first but I knew I had to adjust so Ive started powerlifting kite landboarding and running.

5886531,0,t1_cxr8ydr,There are a few differences between the wireless signal in headphones and a guitar. First your audio in your wireless headphones is a lot lower quality than the audio signal going to an amp from a guitar. The data for the headphones is compressed and the signal is boosted artificially by a battery in your headphones leading to loss of clarity and loss of dynamics. There is a delay when dealing with high quality wireless headphones because in most instances it does not matter listening to music conversing etc On fast gaming style headphones they sacrifice quality for speed. Feedback attenuation interference all problems with wireless especially when you consider that a guitar pickup is just a big magnet. So second wireless transmitters and receivers on guitars must be more complicated. Thus making them more expensive.Third in your gaming applications the transmitter has power. A guitar has no power meaning you would have to have a battery. Now on the amp side the receiving port is powered as well so you would have to adapt the amplifier to the receiver. That can be tricky. And finally every guitar existing right now is built with the same core principals. Its been that way since the s. You can take a brand new Les Paul and plug it into a s Marshal Stack. To suddenly change that and introduce a new technology well It just would mean you were making proprietary instruments. That is bad marketing .,Guitar,cxr9ahw,8,t5_2qi79

When you get back to I it will feel natural because that V chord will just resolve right back into the root chord.

5945768,0,t1_cxywuxp,gt David Gilmour doesnt play some kind of unique guitaramppedal combo that nobody else uses but you can still recognize his playing  because of his techniqueAs far as I know David Gilmour Strat has a special feature his Strat has a twoway toggle switch that activates neck pickup to the middle and bridge positions basically it activates all three pickups simultaneously which does create different tone. People often make this sort of mod to their regular Strat to emulate DG Strat tone.Nevertheless technique does play a great role in a players sound and players like Gilmour and May are pretty unique in that way. Their approach of playing and the way they play do add different textures and certain characteristics to their sound indeed.

5952669,0,t3_3wwz14,As a person who has built for myself and others professionally I tell people that you dont go into a build to save money.  Avoid the bargain bin parts unless you just want the experience.  Build to make a guitar just to your liking right out of the starting gate.  It pays to have some outside tech help if you are new to building as it is really easy to get something wrong when ordering parts from different companies.  The last one I did for a customer turned out great but even then I had to do more than just screw stuff together.  Fitting the neck for instance needed some sanding and patience getting it lined up perfect.  I still had to dress the frets a little too.  In the end hes got a one of a kind guitar that has his choice of hardwareelectronics.  I think where builds go wrong is compromising on certain things.  A cheap body or neck is going to haunt you.  One build I did for myself was a great neck and a great body but from two different makers and the fit wasnt so great.  At the time I thought it would be OK since it all screwed together but the guitar never quite played in tune no matter what I did.,Guitar,cxzxbax,2,t5_2qi79

For my daily players I an get a month out of a set of Nanos before theyre shredded and around  weeks with uncoated strings before they get too dull.  So for me a  pack of uncoated will last double what a single set of Nanos will and at the same cost.  I also get the brighter tone that I like with uncoated Nanos always sound like they have a week or two on them.I do have a few closet guitars that Ive been thinking of throwing Elixirs on though.

5999542,0,t3_3xma41,In a nutshell Compressors give you sustain on a clean sound without adding overdrive unlike a drive pedal or distortion pedal. Alternatively you can use a compressor along with an overdrive tone in order to still get a lot of sustain but use less overdrive.I have said on this sub before that a compressor should be on every pedal board and that I consider it one of the top  necessary pedals out there along with a tuner an overdrive a reverb or delay if your amp doesnt have reverb and an EQ pedal. A lot of players dont know how to use compressors properly and it makes sense that they dont like them. The key to a compressor is to use it right. If you use too much of it it will squeeze your tone rather than just add sustain. Some people like that and use it as an effect but if want it to be transparent you have to use it right which really means not too much. A third way to use a compressor is by increasing the output from your guitar going into the front of a tube amp driving your preamp a little harder in order to get more gain kind of like a boost pedal.Here is a cheesy but great minute video explaining why most guitarists could benefit from having a compressor,Guitar,cy62juv,61,t5_2qi79

The reverb driver itself is basically a tiny speaker hooked up to a spring with a microphone at the other end of the spring or connected somewhere else.

C has no sharps or flats.The letter G can be written in one stroke dont have to lift your pencil off the paper.  G has  sharp.  The sharp it has is the F a half step down from the root called the  of the scale.  Every time you shift to the right on the circle the sharp that is added is a half step down from the root.The letter D takes two strokes.  D major has  sharps.  The letter A takes three strokes.  A major has  sharps.  The letter E has four strokes.  E major has  sharps.  B is kinda like E but with the curvy bits.  Well just call that adding one and B has  sharps.  F has  sharps just gotta memorize that one.  Can you guess what the newest sharp in F major is?On the flat side going left from  oclock counterclockwise sometimes called the circle of ths the scales spell out F Bb Eb Ab Db Gb.  Think of the word BEAD put an F in front and a G at the end.  The Gb is the same sounding scale as the F that finished up the circle of ths.  If you look at the Circle of Fifths you can find the FBEADGC pattern everywhere look at that list of letters backwards and see if you can find it in the circle.F has one flat. Bb.  Bb has two flats  Bb and Eb.  Eb has three flats  Bb Eb and Ab.  Ab has  flats Bb Eb Ab Db.  Db has  flats Bb Eb Ab Db Gb.  Gb has  flats Bb Eb Ab Db Gb and Cb.Notice that the order of flats also spells out BEADG.Also notice that the new flat is also the next key.  After F major which has Bb comes Bb major.  After Ab major which has Bb Eb Ab and Db comes Db major.Perfect Ear is a good app for ear training.Answer to question above F major has  sharps F C G D A and E is the newest sharp added.

6050326,0,t3_3ydb5w,One quick fix that might work instead of getting a new nut would be to put a piece ofthe same string on the nut under the actual stringin case the buzz comes from open string hitting the first fret.It could be that your neck isnt properly adjusted and therefore the first fret being too close to the nut in terms of height so first check if your neck is properly adjustedthere are loads of videos on youtube. But it being only one string doesent sound like this is the problem.It could also be coming from the bridge which is most likely source of your buzz. One of the parts where the string is resting on might be a bit loose. It can be fixed sometimes by simply moving it backwards and forwards to make it settle better. If it doesent help you could try adjusting the string so that the part on which the string rests is pulled all the way to the bridge this will make it so that its not wobbling for sure. But the problem with this is that it will make the intonation go off but can be countered by moving the whole bridgeshould be possible in your les paul so that the intonation of gstring is correct and adjust the intonation of other string according to the gstring. G and low E are usually the longest strings when intonated correctlyg slightly longer than E so it shouldnt be a problem.But doing this requires you to know how to intonate your guitar. Its not a hard task to learn if you have even a bit of common sense and carefully look at some instructional videos its also pretty essential skill to learn. There is also a possibility that its both the bridge piece where the string rests being loose and string hitting the first fret.You should try to listen very carefully where the buzz comes from if you plan on doing something about it on your own. Trying to do some random fixes and hoping it would work isnt the best way.,Guitar,cycp89s,2,t5_2qi79

Also didnt like how as a viewerlistener its only at the end where you I get the soloclimax which you would assume makes sense but for me the build up was inconsistent. Couldve had more of a climax at that ish mark with more of a decline back into the song itself rather than the cut IMO. Interesting Idea though to go fo a vocal melody style something more guitarists can practice for sure! Other than that maybe throw in some seasoning on the little things a trill here a pinch harmonic there can make each vocal line be similar but different enough to keep it fresh.

Their guitars ranged from cheap studentlevel instruments up to midgrade ones. Many of their stringed instruments carried the May Bell brand name on the headstock in much the same way that some modern guitars say Epiphone by Gibson. The cheapest guitars were outsourced to Regal while the upperend models were built inhouse by Slingerland.Theres a great site devoted to Slingerland guitars including some scans of a s catalog that may help you pin down the model. The archtop models were mostly midgrade instruments with solid pressed tops. Theyre not too highly sought after but thats mainly because people are unaware of their existence.

6111560,0,t1_cyjz8fv,I dont quite understand whats going on here.If the greenyellow wire are ground like it looks like they are wheres the pickup in this picture?From what I understand the pickup wires should go to the center volume luggtshouldnt there be a wire running from the middle contact on the volume pot top to the hot contact on the output jack? Instead theyve got the output jack hot running to the tone pot.To answer this its valid for the pickup to connect to either left lug for standard wiring or the center lug typically for when you want independant volume controlls for  or more pickups. Thats whats used on a Jazz Bass by default or what youd alter on a les paul if you want each volume knob to control each pickup completely separately rather than the guitar turning off if either volume is turndown down all the way.Since you only have one volume knob its not needed but its not an invalid configuration either.Also it doesnt matter if the output goes to the tone pot before the output jack. Its more or less the same wiring just connected in a different way. If youre looking for more treble as you turn the volume down or more accurately less loss of treble... perform a treble bleed mod on the volume knob. All volume knobs will make your sound muddier as you turn the volume down unless you have a treble bleed installed on it.,Guitar,cykbl9i,1,t5_2qi79

6121370,0,t3_3zcqbg,There are no right and wrong answers to technique. However I would consider the following aspects when determining if I want to adjust my technique which I have done several times over the  years of playing. Is there a risk of injury? Tendonitis is a real bitch.. Is it producing the tone  sound you want?. Can you still produce the same sound while improving other areas e.g. accuracy speed consistency etc. if you adjust your technique?I used to hold the pick like you do. I think many players do in some variation like George Benson or James Hetfield. Its possible to get a nice thick and sharp tone on downstrokes like this but changing the angle of the pick requires much larger movements which makes it less agile IMO if you hold the pick with the thumb and the side of your index finger its easy to adjust the angle on the fly just with your fingers. It also ties up your middle finger which I like to use for hybrid picking tapping tremolo bar etc. ,Guitar,cylfppm,1,t5_2qi79

6149793,0,t1_cyon92c,Youll be surprised at how many there are of them there is a market for people that want a classical guitar body or whatever but with steel strings. Even the resonance is a bit different a bit more wooden or tinny a shallow sound resembling old resonator guitars or the guitar is done right. Some even get these guitars just for the fat neck or the machine heads that are at another angle. The real problem is the headstock doesnt snap the tuning pegs or gears under pressure truss rod and bridge doesnt matter what shape as long as it keeps intonation and the bracing keeps it from pulling off or bulging the body of the guitar . Those three things have to be there and have to be able to handle the tension of steel strings. If they are present and working properly your guitar is for steel strings and it doesnt matter in what style it is made in. ,Guitar,cyoo0yw,-19,t5_2qi79

Sure you can probably find some online teacher who you can understand best thats all great however thats not making you learn easily it is just making it less hard. Also there is the fact that for different people being able to play means different things. Ever since Ive started playing for me being able to play meant being able to improvise or make up a song on the spot rather than learning a whole library of songs.With that out of the way yes guitar is tough to learn but its also fun! As other users have recommended you can use justinguitar to get started and use rocksmith later.

SuggestionsA real Gibson. Pick up a lower model SG Special or Jr. for around  US our local Guitar Center has some brand new Juniors for  right now.Mexican Fenders are fantastic both Teles and Strats. Buy a used one for  and spend another  on good pickups and youll have a pro quality axe.PRS SE. Very nice guitars for around  US brand new.Id stay away from the Epiphones except maybe the hollow bodies which are built extremely well nowadays. The lower priced Epis would need extensive upgrading to get them to giggable reliability and tone and if youre willing to pay  for a higher end model why not just get a stripped down Gibson instead for the same price? The lower priced Gibsons are the exact same guitars as the higher end ones minus the binding pretty wood and fancy finishes. Build pickups hardware and electronics are the same.

6285131,0,t3_41igqt,IMO it depends.  I swapped out some crappy factory pickups on an old Ibanez  string to some SD Blackouts.  It sounds a lot better but it still has a super heavy neck that makes me not want to play it.  Id say if the guitar is comfortable for you then mod it.  I wish I wouldnt have wasted the time and money on mine.  I couldve had the guitar in its original state plus the  I spent on pickups to put toward a nicer Ibanez.    ,Guitar,cz41rc7,1,t5_2qi79

6288593,0,t1_cz4en9l,Ive thought about this on bass as well but think its a bit counterproductive The long scale length makes walkingbass lines uncomfortable The increased range usually doesnt sound very good A bass usually plays a single note at a time so the new  chord shapes are not really worth muchOTOH there are benefits for niche playstyles like widespread chords or Meshuggahlike spread basslines.Ive been playing NSTfor a while and the benefits are mostly the same as Ive seen the G string as a bit of an extra in NST.

But I run it usually though my Fryette Power station. Not only is it an attenuator but a way to bring your rig stereo! Its watt l power amp AND an attenuator not at the same time.

6298248,1,t3_41vfbd,All the reasons listed but also because E is the relative minor of G which lends itself to songwriting on the guitar quite nicely.Weve got an Eminor song called Gamera on our latest album and its a fun key to use.  Pretty much all the chords used Em G D C B are threestring triads played with one finger.  Then the solo is pretty much just wanking away at the pentatonic scale.To nonguitarists it sounds like Im working really hard on that song but its actually way easier than many of our simple songs where Im playing almost all rhythm parts.Find it on Spotify of Hearo.fm if you dont want to spend anything just to listen to it.  The album is called Number One Fan.Edit Downvoted for shameless selfpromotion?  I offered a free way to listen to it and I think that track illustrates what I was talking about pretty well.

6307915,0,t3_41zi7p,Both are using the basic Natural Minor scale  Aeolian. Its really obvious in the second example and the folkish Skyrimesque sound is just a result of a nylon string guitar with a fat amount of reverb. Regarding the first example the melody is harmonized at a th harmony. So if one guitar is playing an A note the other is playing an E note that is the th interval. Learning your Aeolian will allow you to do these harmonies very easily. So learn your Aeolian scalemode and also practice quarternote triplets since thats the beat of the melodies here. four beats per measure three notes picked per beat. This will sound count out like  ONE two three TWO two three THREE two three FOUR two three...EDIT Quarter note triplets are very common in Celtic music as well if you need more inspiration. The modes youll hear frequently in Celtic are Dorian and Mixolydian.,Guitar,cz6n0i3,3,t5_2qi79

6310239,0,t1_cz5pfhr,Umm first of all  as soon as you guys shipped each other guitars you relinquished ownership of those items.  You dont own something youve shipped to someone else anymore the person who has paid for it with a trade in this case and who has possession of the item is the owner.So with that being the case  he has absolutely NO RIGHT to negotiate with Fedex on a claim for the guitar that you have possession of and OWN at this point.  If you feel there is an issue you can NEGOTIATE with him and Fedex to resolve the issue but it is up to YOU as the receiving party and not him.He received what he was supposed to receive unless you WANT to get your old guitar back it should be you receiving money from Fedex for the guitar.  You completed your end of the trade Fedex damaged YOUR item.  I would not take my guitar back under any circumstance and you should immediately contact Fedex to dispute his claim and work it out yourself.Hes seen an opportunity to screw you over and its really shady what hes trying to do.,Guitar,cz6wje6,1,t5_2qi79

6321384,0,t1_cz83vpf,When I was in the market for a  size I looked heavily into the recording kings vs blueridge. Have to be careful because a bunch of their models have the classic V neck which can be rather chunky and its a love it or hate it kind thing. Also I think the the RKs have a classical nut width while the Blueridges have the slight narrower width.I wound up going with a Blueridge A I found in GCs online used section. For  it has Adirondack spruce top with solid rosewood back and sides forward scalloped X bracing and jumbo frets which are amazing on an acoustic. Plus its got a great slim neck profile which is super comfortable for my smaller hand size. All in all both the RKs and Blueridge are great Martin clones ,Guitar,cz86763,1,t5_2qi79

Because amps lacked so many features and were practically unusable those who could at least use them shined like butterflies!Things like master volume PCB boards solid state rectifiers FX loops are known to have a SLIGHT negative effect on tone but with all combined the effect doesnt become so small anymore and youd die for a vintage amp!

Once you know all  versions youll have  slightly different ways to play a given chord each at a slightly different location on the neck and with its own subtle tonal variation. I would highly recommend the CAGED method which derives its name from these  bar chord forms. There are also corresponding scale patterns based around each of these shapes as well.

If there is a particular song or style that you really like and want to learn you can break it down into parts and tackle them one at a time.

NNS allows for slash chords as well for example a  in the key of C would be CE.

While I agree with you too a point Id say that understanding scales positions and other fundamentals are just as important as just learning new songs.. if not more.For me personally I loved just learning peoples solos when I started some  years ago.. But it wasnt until I learned my pentatonic positions that I really begun to experience the blank canvas effect and noticed my creativity sky rocket. That to me at least is way more fun than simply playing copy cat riffs.From there learning songs and solos would serve to inspire my playing not dictate it. ,Guitar,czhjwys,26,t5_2qi79

6406844,0,t3_43fkvj,Get the nut looked at. Its impossible to diagnose anything properly without actually handling the guitar but in my experience a lot of guitars come from factories with inadequately cut nuts especially if you use strings that are a bit on the heavier side. Also get your truss rod checked out. Theyre not that hard to adjust if you do your diligent research but its understandable if you dont want to fuck with that.EDIT Also your frets might need to be dressed. Its essentially a partial or complete leveling of all the frets with each other recrowning and then polishing of the frets which will enable the guitar to have the lowest fastest action possible with minimal fret buzz. If your guitar is brand new from the factory however it shouldnt need much fretwork. Typically guitars that are old and beat up need a fret dressing.,Guitar,czhw5xx,1,t5_2qi79

6435049,0,t3_43u0g1,Headroom is the amount of acoustic volume or signal level you can put into a device amp pedal preamp etc. before it audibly distorts.Guitar amps have at least two amplification stages the preamp and the power amp. In some amps the preamp consists of multiple amplification stages but lets ignore that for the sake of simplicity. Your guitars signal first enters the preamp where most of the tone shaping takes place. The treble and bass controls are part of the preamp as is usually the volume control. The signal then moves to the power amp which does affect the tone a bit but is primarily there to boost the signals amplitude before it goes to the speaker.Every amplification stage has a maximum headroom or a maximum amount of signal it can take without audibly distorting. You can often get an amp to overdrive at a lower volume by flooding the preamp with a loud signal. Thus a lot of people use pedals to amplify their signal before it hits their amps preamp theyre taking advantage of the preamps limited headroom to make it distort.,Guitar,czkx7g6,63,t5_2qi79

And the latency is so close to not being useable that you dont have to add a lot of latency from softwareguitar effects amp sims etc for it to become unusableor you could ofc direct monitor when recording but then you wont hear the effects of amp sims. Thats why its good to have less latency than just barely enough and since i has only barely enough and others have more room for software latency its especially important to get something else than i if you plan on running amp sims and all that stuff.,Guitar,cznstak,1,t5_2qi79

Save your money for a quality guitar that you feel good about when buying it. Also dont buy it on the first day. Come back a few times and try the same model or other cool models in different shops so you can figure out the differences and compare sounds between pickups.

Or is this in the original standard tuning?. there are a number of chords on top of each tab am I supposed to play the chord on that spot or does it simply show the hand placements? . what are circled numbers and how do I play these? . for these that are really close to each other    how do I play them?

Usually people want it to be as low as possible without getting buzz but some want it to be a bit higher Adjust the intonation by adjusting the string length on the bridgeso that open string and th fret fretted are both in tune. If the th fret is too sharp while open is in tune make the string longer if flat make it shorter. When checking this play the guitar as you normally would not just have it lay on a table when checking the th fret Check that the floyd is still okay readjust it if needed Check the intonation again if you readjusted the floyd,Guitar,d01udru,1,t5_2qi79

6613638,0,t3_469beg,Most of my understanding of guitar electronics is functional.  I know how to wire my guitar because Ive done it that way before and it works.  Not necessarily because I understand how circuits capacitors and pots actually work.  So this is stretching my understanding but Ill try to help.I think you may run into a problem with how youre introducing the tone control into the circuit.  Ill start with a  way switch.  It has two inputs a ground and an output.  Typically you wire two hot leads from a pickup to the inputs.  So pos  selects neck and pos  selects bridge.  Then pos  selects both at once.  So the issue is that a tone control isnt a source of input.  Rather it is added to the hot lead of a pickup and is capable of siphoning part of that signal through a capacitor and to ground.  When you introduce the tone control via the  way switch youre simply adding it as a source of input to send to the output of the switch.The kicker is that Im not sure if it would interact with the pickups signal like you want.  You need the tone control to be able to take away from the pickups signal.  But the way the  way switch works I believe it just wont do anything.  It is a problem with signal flow.  The signal goes into the switch from the pickup and gets sent to the output if the switch is in that position.  In the middle it simply adds the other input to the signal.  But it doesnt divert the pickups signal to the tone control because the tone control is entering the switch as an input.  Sorry if thats confusing.  It could be wrong.  But thats how a  way switch makes sense to my brain.  Alternatively I am pretty confident you could use a simple SPST switch to accomplish what you want except no dead position and have settings for tone control enabled and tone control bypassed.  Just use the normal single humbucker wiring diagram  Insert a SPST switch in the place of that little connection between leg  of the volume control and leg  of the tone control.  So the wire comes from the volume control to the middle leg of the SPST switch.  Then the top leg of the switch goes to the tone control like normal.  The bottom leg stays bare.  ,Guitar,d03emxd,2,t5_2qi79

It takes a long time man. And I know the pain. Heres a couple things Id recommend. Try changing up your exercises. Instead of just doing one thing try to always make up new things to keep yourself engaged and to look at it from different ways. So you might go up and down a mode and think about how each note relates to the chord you might play one note in the mode then play every chord in the key and think about how it relates. You might then play the arpeggio of one chord in every position this helped me seeing the skeleton of the chord makes it easier to envision all the other notes.

In other words if a K pot A functions fine and K pot B functions fine they are going to sound exactly the same. Now a K pot is going to sound slightly different than a K pot for example but brands or quality dont matter. Think of them like a light switch. It either works or it doesnt. One brand of light switch doesnt make the light brighter than another. Some may argue that one brand may last longer than another turn smoother than another etc and thats fine but as for trying to compare tone  thats a pointless endeavor. Same with wire.

I may decide to throw some quick twiddly bits in but only if I can get the timing correct as to keep the rhythm constant. The way I change the strumming up allows you to essentially hear different sounds coming from the chords. You may half strum the likes of Em and then pluck the G B and E strings. There are so many combinations of partial strumming and plucking. Just get the funk with it and find a friend to improvise little solos as you play.

It was my main guitar for the next  years when I bought a real Strat.  After not playing any of the other guitars I also bought a cheap flying V copy during this time I sold all except the strat.Over the next  years I started regretting those sales would have come in handy to have extra guitars set up in alternate tunings or for slide work etc.  I had also always wanted a real Les Paul.  I finally bought my Les Paul in .  Soon after my wife left not related to the Les Paul purchase and suddenly I started having a lot more disposable income.  I bought a cheap Rondo Tele and then a Gretsch Electromatic within the first year or .  Then realized the cheap Tele was cheap and bought a real one.  Then met my next wife who loved buying me guitars for birthday and xmas presents.  That got me a Gibson SG then Epiphone Casino Epiphone  Ultra Fender Jaguar Gibson ES and finally a Gibson ES this past year for xmas.Being old having all kids grown having lots of disposable income is great.  I recommend it highly.  Do I play them all?  No.  I have some shit guitars set up with high action and heavy strings for slide.  A few cheaper guitars but good players are only taken out to gigs or left at my drummers house for practices.  Then I rotate through my favorite guitars based on my mood when playing every night at home my strat tele  SG and Jag are the main players.A lot of times switching guitars is like getting new gear and it becomes different and exciting.  Ive been playing my  nearly every day since getting if for xmas.  Recently I started playing some of the others and remembered why I love them so much.  There has been absolutely no drawback to owning this many.  The only negative has been the ones Ive sold.  I would love to have that Takamine back that I played longer than any of these other guitars.  Proof ,Guitar,d09bzdq,2,t5_2qi79

Clone  RhodesOrgan Knows his theory but actually play the keyboard at all. Ends up piecing together chords and trying to be as dynamic as possible. Clone  Manager He auditioned for Lead  but didnt make the cut. Honestly he was downright awful and we didnt have the heart to tell him so we asked him to manage and made it seem like it was a big deal.

They just simply do not have a lot of lefty customers so their stock is very very limited. And if I want something they do not have theyll have to order it and I will have to pay minimum  euros extra just for the delivery and what not. And shit man when I sometimes see a signature guitar of one of my favorite guitarist I want to play it feel it Im sure everybody knows this feeling.

6757384,0,t3_489ies, You need to know your guitar like it is an extension of your arm. Get as comfortable as you can with your instruments of choice. You need to be able to pick up things by ear even if it takes you a bit. Tabs arent always online or accurate. Youll need to develop a sense of relative pitch. This will also help you as a songwriter. It is a wonderful thing to be able to play what you hear in your head. Know your strengths and weaknesses as a guitar play. For example Im not a shredder. I dont even bother attempting it when my band does covers. My strength is playing cleanly and avoiding sloppiness. Even if I cant beat a solo into the dirt with speed I know I can whip out cool licks that are articulate and intentional.  Set goals for yourself. If you have a weakness that you want to fix you need to take time to do it.  Practice with an amp. Itll make your bad habits and mistakes more obvious.  Know the importance of both of your hands. So many new players work on their fretting hand more than their strumming  picking hand and it can really limit your playing. A good solution for this is learning to pick every note you play in different riffs even if unnecessary. It will help you learn to synchronize your hands. Ive seen other people in this thread say a lot of helpful pieces as well so hopefully the culmination of all of our advice puts you in the right direction. ,Guitar,d0i9qg3,1,t5_2qi79

6759830,0,t3_48bm19,This is a good writeup.  However I would also say that its also incredibly useful to make sure there is someone in the band who knows gear like the back of his hand.  Our bassist is a fantastic player also a wonderfully gifted drummer but couldnt help identify a problem with his ampguitar to save his life.  There needs to be someone in the band who knows how to identify the gear needs of the band and how to at a minimum identify gear problems with a preference for being able to fix them.  Im a far less talented player but am an absolute gearhead so thats my role in the band.  It saves us a ton of money on repairsright now its saving us from paying to get the bass repaired and means that we dont waste time on ampsguitar purchases that just wont work for our music.Of course some of this kind of thing can be learned as you go but its absolutely wonderful to know that you dont have to wait for the shop to get your guitarbass back to you for a short in the wiring or even for something as simple as swapping tubes.

That said with regards to effects its always good to remember you dont need to buy everything at once you can always pick pedals up as you wantneed them. Heck depending on what music youre playing you may not need any at all or you may need a whole bunch.Theres a lot of bargains to be had for used stuff and the modern clones being made in China e.g. Joyo Mooer tend to be pretty good and affordable. Also look at multieffects pedals  for one purchase you get a lot of different effects not all of which are necessarily the best sounding but do the job perfectly well check out ones by Zoom Line  Boss etc..Depending on the amp you have at the moment an acoustic may be a good addition  its something you cant simulate terribly well with an electric guitar. But if your amp isnt suitable for what you want at the moment e.g. not loud enough to play in a bandwrong sound for your music and electric guitar is your main focus it might be better to upgrade the amp and get on with your guitar path and get an acoustic a little later on.,Guitar,d0k703q,1,t5_2qi79

6813462,0,t3_491v71,This may or may not apply to you so disregard it if its not your particular issue.A hell of a lot of people who only ever play by themselves have timing problems. Without an external beat to keep you honest most people will speed up and slow down all over the place while playing. In a band thats terrible. My best advice for getting ready for playing with other people is to make sure you practice playing with some external time source like a loop pedal a drum machine backing tracks or the mp of the song itself if its a cover. Getting into the habit of listening to what everyone else is doing rhythmically while still making sure to get your end of things right well  make you better at playing with others.,Guitar,d0olq5s,3,t5_2qi79

6835419,0,t1_d0qwygm,gt First of all any suggestions what could it be? Im not really savvy when it comes to electronics and there are no guitar shops in my town.Bad solder joints or dirty contacts most likely. You can get some contact cleaner and spray down the electronic to see if that helps. If its a bad joint you can simply resolder it. If a pot or the selector switch has magically gone bad as they do sometimes just get new ones. Id rewire the entire guitar if you have to replace something just so its consistent. It doesnt cost much if you do the work yourself.gtSecond question can I tinker with the cables while the guitar is plugged to my turned on amp? I need to know when I lose the signal but I feel like I might fuck something up the amp the guitar me?I wouldnt do that.

It took me a while to build up my collection of effects after I bought my bigger tube amp and I only have  pedals. This is mostly because I bought a bunch of different pedals over time and sold them.

And not only feel it to keep time but be able to use certain elements of the rhythm riff in your solo for example the strumming pattern incorporating variations of the melody into the solo. A good example would be the solo for Cold Shot by SRV. Notice he uses the riff intermittently throughout the solo to remind the listener of the rhythm. ,Guitar,d0rsxwo,1,t5_2qi79

6847960,0,t1_d0qzzll,gt The best guitar players I know teach play corporatewedding gigs and have a band or two that can play at a busy bar on a Saturday night......Probably averaging between KK yearly.Interesting.  I have a few old teachers who survive on the giggingteaching thing.  One did private lessons out of his house had a rock trio and did solo jazz gigs and he was clearing  a year and that was probably ten years ago.  If you are in a reasonably affluent area and you have a local reputation you can pull in a lot of money teaching and gigging.  The other one  who is one of the most versatile and well rounded musicians I have known  teaches public school as well as community college and privately and pretty much gigs nonstop....not sure how much money he makesmade but he had so many god damn kids that I dont think he could have stopped gigging even if he wanted to.  I used to be a TA in his Guitar I class in high school when I was a senior and we were close because I was already out playing professionally so he was a bit of a mentor to me.  I remember all the kids thought he was a tool because he looked like your typical  year old man so he wasnt cool to them.  They didnt like his dadjokes or that he made them listen to guitar music that wasnt recorded exclusively by dimebag darrel Nirvana or fallout boy.  They just assumed he didnt know shit despite like I said him being one of the most talented musicians I have met.  One day one of the bratty little freshmen that wouldnt shut up and thought he was super cool because he discovered Led Zeppelin in  tried to mock him I bet you cant play the solo to stairway to heaven!.  Normally he wouldnt have indulged this but I think he was really pissed off at this kid being a constant distraction.  He told the kid to bring the CD to the front of the class.  He puts on stairway to heaven and fastforwards to the solo.  He proceeded to let the first  seconds of the solo play then he hits pause.  He picked up his guitar and burned through the first  seconds note for note.  then he did it again kept letting a bit of the solo play and then nailing it perfectly on one listen.  Now I know that it isnt the hardest solo in the world and it is pretty much standard pentatonic licks......but watching him make that littleshit eat his words was priceless.  These kids were too dumb to realize that this guy was a better guitar player than just about all of their idols that they worshipped.  They couldnt see past the old man appearance.  They were too dumb to realize that he had been playing for decades....he used to play the same bar circuit in Boston as Aerosmith before they got huge.  The dude has been around and seen some shit.  Incredible jazz player.  decent classical player.  He was your ideal studio type musician in that he could sit in on anything and immediately play something ridiculous.  Seemed like his idol was Larry Carlton so that sort of makes sense.  But dumb high school freshmen dont want to listen to Larry Carlton or Robben Ford.  They think there is nothing they can learn from anybody except Pantera.  I almost died of laughter the first school day after Dimebag Darrel died because all these shitty players in the class were wearing homemade DIMEBAG RIP shirts and talking about it constantly and he referred to the guy as Douchebag Darrell.  That one really stuck with me.  I have no hate of Dimebag Darrell although I DO hate his tone and Panteras albums got worse every single time.  ,Guitar,d0siuh6,1,t5_2qi79

I think the wood makes a big difference and changing pickups isnt always as huge a deal as people here make it out to be.I understand the gratification doing mods on a guitar gives you. It makes you feel like a man like an artist and scientist. Someone your dad would respect. You work with wood and electricity. You can handle a dremel and a soldering iron you understand radii and capacitors. And that makes you enjoy modding and hold it in high regard and talking about it like you are a wizard that can turn an Epiphone Maestro LP Jr into something befitting Billy Joe Armstrongs personal collection by throwing in an SD humbucker really quiets your insecurities.

6903029,0,t3_4aac0h,Ive been playing guitar for about fifteenyears now and recently picked up violin. Im not sure that I can give you a definite answer but Ill give you what I know going from guitar to violin. I cant be sloppy in my fingering on a violin. With a guitar you just got to make it within the fret and boom. Violin is much smaller than a guitar and thus moving between the two means learning the difference in distance.Posture. Its so much more forgiving with guitar. Yes you need to have some of it if youre trying to play some Paganini type shit on the guitar but just generally its much more forgiving. For shits sake Hendrix played it behind his head. Try that with a violin! Tuning. Its much more sensible on violin. On guitar it was laid out in a way to make playing chords as easy as possible. It can be a little frustrating or less intuitive anyway.  This may be less obvious but classical music is in general more technical. Thus it takes you less time to sound decent on a guitar. A year of good consistent practice and you can play chords and sing songs. Hope that helps! Good luck!,Guitar,d0yrzos,1,t5_2qi79

But the difference is Hendrix basically spearheaded that hard rock sound while Harrison before Sgt. Pepper was still very much a rock n rollrockabilly style guitarist.

6948992,0,t1_d13w1oq,Actually the last chord of a song generally indicates the key as all other noteschords resolve back to the root or tonic as we say in the Music Theory world. If all of the chords you mentioned are major that would be a little odd but one good trick for figuring out the key a song is to look for  major chords that are exactly one whole step i.e.  half steps or  frets apart. These will be the IV and V chords respectively from which you could deduce the I chord and therefore the key. For example in the chords you listed you can see that G and ABb chords are both major and exactly one whole step apart therefore they are the IV and V chords which would in turn make D the I chord and therefore the key the song is in so you could play a D major scale andor its relative minor scale of C minor. In that case the F chord would be the iii chord and generally be minor but you can always make it whatever you like. Theory is simply meant to describe what youve played not dictate it. ,Guitar,d140066,1,t5_2qi79

I made a video when I started outlining some things with a link to the Paul Gilbert video I was learning from which I think is one of the best resources out there to learn that shredding style.Shredding is really just a combination of alternate picking left  right hand coordination and a very specific way to arrange your runs which is based on math so that when you switch between strings and frets you are doing it in the most economical way to go fast.I havent made a followup video yet showing how far I have come in just  months but I will post one very soon.  ,Guitar,d1b1i1n,2,t5_2qi79

Just make sure you use the proper wiring schematics because pickup manufacturers use different color codes on their wires. As for recommendations if you want to stay Dimarzio there are a few options out there. The Titan is the one Id recommend first. Nice and tight for palm mutes and has exceptional string separation for big extended chords. If you want something slightly less modern the Evolution is also a good pup. Not as tight as the Titan but the palm mutes will still hit pretty hard. Recommendations from other than DimarzioBlack Winter from Duncan. Marketed for black and death metal but its probably the most versatile of their high output pups. Sick chugs searing single note runs fluid lead lines.Juggernauts from Bareknuckle. Very even across the sonic spectrum to my ear compared to the other pups Ive listed. Amazing string separation crushing palm mutes and sustain for days. The Seymour Duncan Custom. Crunchy chugs but a bit harsh in the highs. Good palm mutes.Duncan Dimebucker. In addition to looking badass the thing is pretty versatile. If you wanna sound like Dime you can but this pup is so much more. You can get a damn good tight modern metal sound from it. ,Guitar,d1gotb7,1,t5_2qi79

The other day someone posted a huge article on transcribing and we often get little gems like this.Something that I see all the time on youtube are people that ask for tabs that tend to get ignored. I feel like theres a reluctance to share tabs or maybe its some kind of unspoken rule to force newer players into learning how to transcribe songs for themselves. As good natured as that intention may be honestly sometimes when Im short on time I just want to be able to look up tabs and start playing. Thats why I always share my transcriptions and update existing tabsfix errors on sites like songsterr because I know someone out there will be glad I did.

7108414,0,t3_4cvxrm,I agree with the other comments about seeking out an instructor I always think a little jazz foundation would never hurt anyone. One piece of advice I got that changed the way I thought about my mistakes off notes especially in solos was that a note may be off from the one that precedes it but it doesnt have to be off from the next note. It only sounds off because of the note you played before it the next note may make it sound ok or on purpose. A note by itself isnt on or off its only on or off in the context of the surrounding notes. You can use the bad notes to change or pivot what youre doing. the obvious help here is that you dont immediately feel bad or self conscious about what youre playing the added benefit is that when you go in another direction it can help you get out of a rut or open your mind to new and interesting possibilities. ,Guitar,d1m46l6,1,t5_2qi79

Problem that you might face there is getting good fuzz sound and finding overdrive pedal for it. All of the launchbox style orange amps are very picky when it comes to pedals. Some overdrives sound good digitech bad monkey comes to mind if you want something dark gainy and cheap but fuzz tends to mush signal too much and generaly produces a bad result.

7132356,0,t3_4d7bmj,Ive got the Vox VT and its nice but someone has already posted it. Ive also got the Vox Rhythm  and its a nice little modelling amp that has  drum patterns and adjustable tempo. Its got a few effects built in as well as most of the amps that the VT has. It can be run off batteries if youre into that. Im going to be giving mine to my father. Its a bit easier to dial in settings than the VT line of amps. Part of the reason is that the VT amps are based on presets  each time you switch amp it loads up a built in preset and ignores all of your various dials. You need to shuffle the dials move them slightly to get it to pick up the change of say the gain or volume. It doesnt bother me all that much but it would confuse my father to have to keep twiddling all the dials each time you switch to a different amp setting. Both are good options and the VT has more settings and effects but is also more expensive and a little annoying to dial in. The VT also lacks the drum patterns which are just nice to play along to. ,Guitar,d1ovbbt,2,t5_2qi79

7152857,0,t3_4dibb9,To my ear the magic is all in the slide.  Such fine control over the left hand not just on the position of the slide to control pitch  but the pressure on the string as well.  A fretted instrument has clear jumps in pitch where you clearly move from one note to the next in half steps.  With the slide you have complete autonomy over pitch.  So it allows for tremendous expression not unlike a fantastic human vocalist.  While some of his lines are drawn from the world of guitar I would guess that he draws from a wide variety of sources.  Singers trumpets strings saxaphones etc...  I hear a pretty wide range of influences and styles that go beyond Western music.  He uses a lot of different intervals in interesting ways.The lines he does steal from other guitar players get infused with little microbends and shakes and vibrato in a way that you just cant do with frets.  He spends a significant amount of time in between notes.  Teasing you with where your brain wants the pitch to land.  He also uses the guitar in a very vertical way often playing lines on a single string  instead of going up  down to an adjacent string.  It really maximizes what the slide is good at.  ,Guitar,d1r7ins,2,t5_2qi79

7242666,0,t3_4emh14,Harmonies are primarily built in intervals of rds and ths. For example a chord is simply a harmony usually a threepart harmony RootThirdFifth.Those actually numeric positions e.g rd th represent scale degrees. So if a scale has the key signature composition of notes like soC Major scale C D E F G A BThen the st rd and th notes are CEG basic counting where CSo to answer your question When you do a harmony you need to know the notes of the main riff then count three or five notes up from them in the respective scale. That means if the notes in a riff in Cmajor was CDFA the rd harmony would be EFAC which really is C D F A. ,Guitar,d21fsre,8,t5_2qi79

7321349,0,t3_4fnop1,My dream setup would be a vintage archtop Gibson with flatwound strings through a pre Matchless amp. Maybe a volume toner overdrive and a Styromon Flint pedal.On a budget Id consider a newer archtop though Id still want it to not be laminate and a clean x tube amp. The Roland JC would also be an option but Im just not the biggest fan of solid state amps even the good ones. It would depend on the usage I guess.,Guitar,d2adxy3,3,t5_2qi79
7321781,0,t3_4fnop1,Thats a pretty cool setup! Got any pics or video clips?Im a jazzer myself and I have a number of different guitars amp amps that I use depending on what Im doing.My usual electric setup for jazzfusion is two custommade PRStype clones into a Friedman PT for dirt and a Fargen Custom Shop Blackbird for cleans the Fender SuperSonic pictured is a backup.The Friedman is a singlechannel Plexi clone but with more of a JCMtype tone when the gain is all the way up. Its  watts EL no effects but a really decent effects loop I use a TC Hall of Fame thats always on for a bit of reverb so its not totally dry and the speaker is a sealed x Celestion Greenback.The Fargen is a singlechannel blackface Fender circuit with a bright switch and spring reverb. Its a  watt L combo with an openback x Tone Tubby  greenie hemp ceramic loudspeaker.The Fender is a stock watt x dual channel that I only use if one of the other amps craps out. I mic all three with Shure SMBs.For pedals I try to keep it pretty simple it looks more complicated than it is see pic. There are two AB boxes for switching between my two main singlechannel amps and my backup channel amp and for switching between the two singlechannel amps themselves for clean or dirty. Since I use two amps everything goes into the front except the reverb on the Friedman which isnt on my board but sits on top of the amp not pictured.Chain is guitar gt Dunlop Bonamassa wah gt EB VP Jr Sonic Research tuner in tuner out gt Keeley knob compressor gt Wampler Velvet fuzz gt EHX Soul Food drive gt JHS Sweet Tea dual overdrive Tube Screamer  JCM in a box gt Diamond TRM tremolo gt MXR band EQ gt Morley ABY for switching between main amps and backup amp gt Morley ABMix for switching between dirty amp and clean ampFor more straight ahead jazz I use the Fargen  this DV Mark Little Jazz x watt solidstate combo as a backupor if I need more power I have a Markbass Little Mark II watt solid state bass head and a Schroeder L xx cab disclaimer I endorse Schroeder cabs. I use the same Hall of Fame for reverb with this setup since as a bass rig it doesnt have any effectsFor guitars I have a pair of jazz boxes. One is a carved  Ed Schaefer sprucemaple with a floating custom midheavy pickup and  gauge flats the other is an Ibanez Pat Metheny PM laminate with a mounted pickup also with gauge flatsIm really happy with this setup. The only thing is lugging  amps for fusion stuff. I love the sound of a Fender combo for cleans and a Marshall Plexi for dirt but its just such a pain to deal with multiple amps. For situations where I dont have the real estate on stage for that or for fly dates etc I use a Line  Helix instead of backline  a pedalboardAt this point I dont think theres anything I would change really. Between the electrics and the archtops and the different amps and pedals and especially the Helix I can get any tones I want with any level of power I might need for various applications.

7347159,0,t3_4fymf1,Yea I would just ask.. I went to my first jam last night Ive been playing guitar for  months. All the other musicians had been playing since they were single digits.. and are now  years old. So needless to say the skill gap was enormous. But I just asked a bunch of questions. Got them to list out the chords before each song and played some rhythm as best I could. We made music.. actually sounded pretty good for the first time playing together. Is it intimidating when one  guy says.. hey lets play this.. plays a lead line.. and the drummer and bassist just figure it out in seconds and jump in outta the blue.. and I sit there looking dumbfounded..  YES. But the best way to learn is the play with people better then you.  So now I gotta work on gaining about  years worth of skill Will I probably have these dumbfounded moments next week as well.. yep... the week after.. Yep... Any playing with other people is better then just practicing by yourself and its motivating. Now I know I gotta learn the riff to Hazy Shade of Winter by next Thursday. For some people thats an easy one. In fact the one guitarist almost had it figured out a minute after I suggested we play it next week. For me.. Ill have to practice it all week. ,Guitar,d2dbl2f,1,t5_2qi79
7349747,0,t1_d2dlfhm,Well thats a hard one to answer. I do it and Im not very skilled. I can use a multimeter and be careful not to touch things I shouldnt. There is danger though. If you do touch the wrong thing you can go poof. The risk is more for you than the amp. Getting the bias way wrong can be damaging but its immediately obvious that its way wrong from the tone. Indeed you dont even strictly need to use a multimeter and can just bias by ear turn the bias pot until it sounds how you like. I think its worth checking just to make sure youre in a reasonable range and not burning out your tubes too quickly.So I dont know. If you wanna get into it its very doable but if you dont want to commit to learning how or if youre not comfortable working with a live amp just get someone to do it for you. Techs generally charge like maybe  or something. There is a world of resources available on the net for learning how to bias including a pdf with pictures for your specific amp.,Guitar,d2dm6ol,1,t5_2qi79
7350822,0,t1_d2dozhu,Yeah that can happen. Ive been playing for...well...a long time  years or so and can pick up my guitar and play a  hour gig without any discomfort even if I havent played in a week or more. I think that just comes from deadening the nerves in my fingertips. If I knew precisely how I was able to do that I would happily share.My best guess is just play regularly but not to extremes. An hour every day is better than  hours in one day once a week. I usually stop practicing when anything hurts  just like I would when working out because thats basically what youre doing right?. So perhaps that will help you build up the endurance you need  it may take a bit longer but I think the results might be better in the long run.Another thing Ive worked on is playing right behind the fret as much as possible so I dont have to put as much pressure on the strings. So perhaps play with your finger positioning some when you practice until you find that sweet spot. Another thing that has helped me is to use multiple fingers on the string when doing bends and vibrato  that seems to keep the pressure evened out across multiple fingers so no one finger is overtaxed and theres not too much pressure on my finger tipspads.Now that I think of it you might want to check the setup on your guitars and make sure you have the best action you can get. Also make sure youre using fresh or relatively fresh strings. They can sometimes get little nicks in them or they lose their elasticity and that makes it harder and thus more painful to play..Im pretty much of the opinion that playing guitar shouldnt hurt. Fatigue certainly but if theres pain involved something isnt quite right.Anyway hope this helps.,Guitar,d2dql5p,1,t5_2qi79
7359847,0,t3_4g4gqc,Just to throw in my two cents there are some draw backs to solid state amps Ive owned a Crate gtx and a Peavy Vypyr  both x combos Main thing is that when you have the gain dialed in and you turn down your instrument volume the distortionoverdrive doesnt dial down. Normally turning it way down would produce almost a clean tone even with the gain up. But instead it produces a thin quieter sound with the same amount of distortion coming through. Part of why that sucks is that it makes it hard to play say bluesy style stuff when you play lightly and clean and then get the chords to breakup and go crunchy when you giver. And you cant compensate with the volume knob to help it any. Some SS amps can give you tones that are pretty close but they generally lack the large dynamic range you can push out of a tube amp with just your volume knob.Secondly Ive had issues getting certain effects to really come through like wahs and tsboosts because the added signal strength doesnt directly change the crunchoverdrivedistortion you get. Instead of your wah pushing your distortion  to sick heights it kinda just sounds like a wah behind a flat distortion. I remember buying a ts tube screamer for my crate and it barely did anything no matter where I put it in the signal chain. Some things like delays reverbs and choruses work fine. But others not so much. There are some great sounding Ss amps Id recommend the peavey vypyr  theyre loaded with great sounding effects. As long as you stick with on board effects they sounds great. Ss also has the ability for wicked features at a low price that tube amps just cant offer like USB emulated cab line outputs so you can record straight to your comp without a mic. And massive power and effects at low prices. If you play metal and only metal SS is great. Jaz blues country or anything that requires an amp to give a large dynamic sound controlled by how you play your guitar you kinda need a tube amp.,Guitar,d2eriu1,1,t5_2qi79

7364844,0,t3_4g5ild,In addition to others when speeding up dont tense up. If you have to tense more to play faster then youre probably doing it wrong. Focus on keeping everything but the muscles actually doing the picking  fingerings as relaxed as possible.This goes for how you hold your pick too. Keep it in place but thats it. Using more force makes it bounce around irregularly when you should be doing as precise movements as possible.

For that price you could try looking at an MGCFX new or the W used. They get a bad rep but get the footswitchchannel switcher for maximum effect to save presets for reverbsdelays. Try saving up for a good OD pedal as well if youre going for this as the gain is somewhat finicky in these units. You could also look at the Fender Mustang II new or get it used. You could also go for the Orange rt but it doesnt provide that much variation in tone. Just the good Orange dirt and a warm clean channel.Edit if youre willing to wait until July or so Marshall is releasing the new CODE series of amps. I believe they should be better than the Mustangs and with the W going for just  theyre a steal for the price. I dont mean to sound fanboyish but theyre getting me excited.,Guitar,d2i2vti,1,t5_2qi79

In fact you probably have to.But I need to be careful with the word study when talking to you.

It feels like Im talking to an apprentice chef who has never cooked a dish but it absolutely certain that training himself to recognize the flavor of every possible ingredient is the way to get good at cooking. And its like man! Put a pan on the heat. Put some shit in it.

Id have you learn to play the  bar form. Chords. With a nice sus shuffle. Dont memorize each licks chords for Jesus sake. Dont you dare memorize anything like vocab words. Just set all that down and play some tunes. Have a little fun if you dont think that would hurt you too bad. Find out about the callandresponse form of traditional blues lyrics.

If youve spent ANY time with an actual Helix you learn right away what the real advantage of a Helix is over any other modeling multifx processor on the market. The real reason to buy a Helix is not all the amp models it does all the routing options all the effects models the multiple independent signal paths the dual processors the expression pedal inputs the colorcoded effects  it is the touchcapactiive footswiches which work like a smartphone screen. To edit an effect live on the fly you just touch the one you want and turn the knobs just like a real pedal. Alternatively you can even edit effects parameters such as delay mix and boost level with your feet using the expression pedal to define ranges. Its a HUGE advance in mutlifx processors and unique to the Helix even other Line  processors dont have this feature. Live editing of effects parameters is THE thing that sets the Helix apart and what makes it just as easy to use as a real pedalboard. ObservegtModular approach.Its worth mentioning that its not eitheror. The Helix has  effects loops so you can use your own individual effects in addition to whats modeled in the unit if you have boutique or vintage pedals that you dont want to give up. You can program them to trigger on and off with your patches and incorporate them into your programmed settings without actually touching them. You can also do channel switching on your amp if you have a channelswitching amp through the Helix preprogrammed into your patches if you want.,Guitar,d2m9cls,2,t5_2qi79

Bass amp would ofc be betterlike tone controls are voiced to guitar in guitar amp not bass. Guitar speakers cand handle bass frequencies well especially at high volumes and might break the speaker but amp head can handle bass signal just fine. Some amp heads might be voiced to be too thin or something like that that doesent suite bassalso your amp should have good amount of clean headroom so thats something to consider if going this route.

It is necessary to explain things like chromatic scales and the like using terminology which it appears you havent been introduced to which is why I have given you the advice I did...It is absolutely possible to teach yourself but based on your questioning and responses I honestly think some lessons even just for an interim period are the best way forward.,Guitar,d2xvany,3,t5_2qi79

Generally if you already understand music a lot of learning an instrument is made easier as youll understand rhythm melody etc.My problem with a classical guitar is that itll be difficult to jam with. A steel string is going to get you more mileage if you ever want to jam. Steel string guitar is probably the quietest acoustic instrument classical would be extremely muted.

But I digress.I am not set on a single color. I want the guitar to look good in my very odd opinion. I dont like a black guitar with a rosewood or maple fretboard. It seems odd to me. I prefer black with an ebony fretboard. Otherwise the colors of the body and fretboard must look at least decent together. I gurrently have my eye on a bright green guitar with a maple fretboart. The others in my collection are a dark flamed maple body and a natural walnut top both with rosewood fretboards. I still have my old black bass.,Guitar,d35leyr,3,t5_2qi79

7604038,0,t3_4jh5zp,Three possibilities least likely  youre wrong about the strings you had on before and they were heavier than the new strings. Least likely because I trust you know what you had. Probable  Your old strings were old enough that they lost the metallic sound credited most with causing buzz. Dead strings may not buzz even on a poorly set up guitar. Most likely  These strings despite bring the same size have a slightly lighter tension than the Super Slinkies and you just need a minor neck adjustment to compensate for the lower tension.,Guitar,d36jfv9,2,t5_2qi79

Some things to be aware of though is that the width of the neck near the headstock is slightly narrower than a standard fender strat and the body is also slightly thinner throughout. In my experience this can be helpful if u havent played before but starts to get annoying as you become more experienced. Sure it wont play like an american standard but if you have it set up right it can be a great starter guitar!,Guitar,d384yvr,2,t5_2qi79

A lot of the ones that were made in Japan are really big right now and occasionally fetch insane prices when in good condition. Your guitar has a similar vibe. Your is also an offset style guitar and those are making a big comeback right now. If you were to market it well and wait patiently you could maybe get some decent money out of it if you chose to do so.I personally wouldnt pay more than  for one in quite good condition and generally only take a second look at guitars like that when theyre asking under  but I would be beyond stoked to find something like that just lying around.

7647384,0,t3_4k1zgj,Well I can say that getting more comfortable playing guitar while standing will help translate over to your stage performance. It only feels uncomfortable because you dont normally practice like that. But if youre gonna be playing shows you cant really be sitting down and playing so getting more comfortable playing while standing is a must. Part of the reason why I like playing in the classical position is because the position of the guitar stays constant whether Im sitting or standing. The reason you play hunched over and static in the first place is because thats most likely how you practice at home just sitting down hunched over not moving. So its not a surprise when your body automatically goes into that position thats the most comfortable way for you to play.The absolute best way to help you loosen up is to just not care how you look on stage. If you try to move around more and look more active youll end up looking really fake. The audience will notice that shit right away. Just kinda bop along to the groove however feels most comfortable to you but you shouldnt really be thinking about how much youre moving around or not while playing. It takes your mind off the music and your playing might suffer. Dont try to emulate anyone youll end up looking like youre trying too hard.You say youre playing blues songs I cant imagine you even need to do much moving around while playing them anyways I mean its not a metal show or anything.,Guitar,d3bgs0e,4,t5_2qi79

7658052,0,t3_4k4v97,One thing I think helps is to focus on a smaller number of strings and a smaller part of the fretboard first. I assume you know the most common shape for the major scale the one that goes  in the key of C. If you dont practice until you know that pattern by heart. Theres one tip that helps a lot with the major scale and the minor scale when you have two notes a half step apart for instance in this example  or  then the next and previous notes are always a whole step higher and below respectively. So even if you only know that shape and not the others you can already find some points to connect with the other shapes by going up or down two frets. That really helped me connect the shapes at the beginning. Also always notice where your root notes are because every time you have a root note then you can repeat the pattern from the lowest  strings just be careful to go up a fret when the B string is involved. So that means when you reach the  on the D string youre back at your root note in this case C is on the  and you can just go up two frets also ties in with the previous tip and start again. The  on the lowest three strings can be played almost exactly the same way from that th fret on the D string just have to go up one fret on the B string  back at the root again. Notice how its the same pattern if you ignore the B string thing. Practice going in and out of the basic shape using these two advices focus on a couple of strings at a time so it doesnt get overwhelming. After a while youll notice where the patterns repeat and it makes it much easier. I know some people frown upon thinking in shapespatterns but I think its important to both think in terms of intervals wheres the third the fifth etc. AND take advantage of the very visual aspect of the guitar which can really make things easier when used in addition to the regular way and some ear training.,Guitar,d3coecf,1,t5_2qi79

7693440,0,t1_d3gnz68,Also to elaborate more on your questionsThink of a beat in music. If youre listening and following along to a song the beat would be the pulses where you tap your foot or bob your head. In  time a consistent beat would give you four beats in a measure    . If we only played a single note for one measure this would be a whole note because it took up all four beats.If we cut the whole note into two equal pieces youd get two notes of two beats eachthese are half notes the first note is played for beats   and the second note gets beats  .If you cut these half notes into two pieces each now you have four notes in the measure for four beatsone note for each beat. These are quarter notes. Cut them in half again and now you have to play two notes for every beat it helps to count these by using the word and in between the actual beats. So  eighth notes in one measure sounds like  and  and  and  and with each syllable getting an eighth note. Notice that beat  is a full beat composed of two half beats  and.You can break it down into sixteenth notes as well this is where the e and a comes inthese sounds represent sixteenth notes. A full measure of sixteenth notes sounds like ONE e and a TWO e and a THREE e and a FOUR e and a with each syllable getting its own sixteenth note. The a is pronounced uh in that sequence  BTW. Theyre grouped together in music for readability. Eighth and sixteenth notes can be quick so pairing them makes them easier to read and play. ,Guitar,d3gp0me,1,t5_2qi79

When I learn a new riff or song I usually really suck at it even though I know all of the noteschords. Its not until I get a click on and slow the song down a ton to really work on the foundation of the riff that I actually get better at the song or riff.

7850688,0,t1_d3yh00b,Id add that hes also keeping his ring finger on the rd fret relative to the capo on the B string which makes the C a Cadd chord and the E an Em. So as far as playing notes just put that finger there and leave it then youre just shifting your index and middle fingers around to form the rest of the chords and the F root note that gets tossed in. As far as I can tell he never plays anything on the high E string so just mute that string with your ring finger as it holds the B string note. Hope that helps!,Guitar,d3yhjtw,2,t5_2qi79

7862494,0,t3_4n07pm,Each click from the metronome equals the number on the denominator of the time signature for example if your time signature is  each click equals a quarter note. If you set the metronome to  bpm and are playing with  time signature after  clicks youve played for  bars.If you set the metronome to  bpm with  signature it means that each click equals an th note. So after  clicks youve played  bars.In both cases youve played the same amount of bars in the same amount of time but one of them holds more information than the other you can put more information into  than   is faster than  in that sense. So you would change from playing slower to playing faster once the time signature change happens. ,Guitar,d3ztd8v,2,t5_2qi79

7907366,0,t3_4njb1t,You could post this to rguitarpedals for more detailed feedback on individual pedals. These are not amazing based on the ones Im familiar with. The person who bought them has two phasers ! and a flanger which is probably more wibblywobbly noises than you really want. Similarly auto wah and acoustic simulation are really niche effects you might have a use for them but theyre not exactly first pedal purchase material.The Small Stone is the only really nice pedal I see here and like the others it looks very battered. EHX pedals dont respond well to rough treatment. As ubolanrox points out if its an old one it might be worth a bit. Now considering the alternatives I went shopping on Sweetwater and put this together based on replicating the sounds on that pedalboard youre most likely to use at a guess with highquality effects EHX Big Muff Pi   EHX Small Stone   or EHX Nano Electric Mistress if youd rather flange than phase similar price Dunlop Crybaby wah   TC Electronic Flashback mini  Thats  new. Theyre all excellent pedals at what they do and are on the boards of many a pro. Youd also need some patch cables and maybe power supplies. You will find all these a fair bit cheaper used if you look.Of course you dont get as many shiny boxes. Im assuming you dont need auto wah and acoustic sim but you can pick up used Boss pedals pretty cheap.,Guitar,d44v2pr,2,t5_2qi79

Once youre used to playing the major scale up and down the neck all you have to do is move it into the key you want and wallah youve mastered the modes. Well the modes of the major scale anyways then if you want to move onto the modes of melodic minor and whatnot you can.

7958657,0,t3_4o8iqa,Ive definitely found myself less motivated to play in some moments because of a new pedal. It was out of the frustration of how long it was taking to dial it in get the order right set up and tear down every time etc. It sounds petty and maybe it is but it happens. Ive also gone from owning two pedals and using one at a time to owning  pedals and using at least  at a time in the past year. So its been an evolving process.Others have made very useful caveats  some pedals basically just suck or dont work in every situation your amp will shape the character of your pedals etc. so I wont go on about all that.But I like to think of adding a new pedal like adding a new instrument  I will not understand this right away. This adds a new layer of complexity. It will take time to figure it out and I will not be good at this right away. Years from now I will still be coming up with new ways to use this or at the very least I will eventually figure out the one thing this does really well and have that down perfectly. Honestly if a pedal doesnt make me start thinking like this at some point it will probably get traded or sold.Practicing setting up and tearing down has also enhanced the ritual aspect of playing that has always appealed to me. Its second nature at this point and helps me get in my zone. However I still make sure to take some time playing without effects to keep my playing sharp. Just dont let it get you down. Push through it and keep playing and experimenting.,Guitar,d4ammfb,1,t5_2qi79

7968203,0,t3_4o5dnd,You can also get tons of mileage out of various inversions and voicings. One thing you can try is this take a chord shape you know. Then move every note in your chord shape down to the next chord tone. Or move every note to the next scale degree. So for example Start with a standard E min  shape th fret on D  on G  on B and  on high E. Move every note in that shape down to the next chord tone to get a new way of playing E min   on D  on G  on B  on E. Now if you want to make that a D Maj  you could move every note down one degree in the scale instead  on D  on G  on B  on E. That last one is one of my personal favorites cause even though its a Maj  it sounds so different from the normal Maj  shape. You can get so many new sounds and chord shapes with this method and of course you can apply it to th and th chords as well.,Guitar,d4bp9n5,1,t5_2qi79

In you pic the shield is only barely visible and the black insulator will need to be cut back to reveal enough of the shield to use for soldering.It appears that currectly you have a bit of wire soldered to both the rightside and leftside tabs. This will need to be changedcut away that bridging wire. The shield will need to be soldered to the viewers rightside tab.I applaud your attemp at DIY repair and if you feel that you want to get deeper into guitar electronics I highly recommend read the book linked below Guitar Electronics for Musicians which can be read for free in your browser takes a bit of time to load.

When you are on stage you are the focal point of a lot of peoples attention and I think a lot of stage fright has to do with the conflict between the part of your person that wants to be unnoticed and the other part of your person thats onstage getting a lot of attention. So what you have to do is own that moment when you are the focal point even if your personality conflicts with that. You have to don a different persona and looking flashy on stage helps me to do that. What happens is that the attention is on your stage self and all the insecurity that stems from being exposed gets sloughed off to your stage self. Its compartmentalization.,Guitar,d4n8vjx,5,t5_2qi79
8070914,0,t1_d4n5k1a,For sure. I think the directional naming schema makes it easier to visualize and digest. Limiting to three zones LeftCenterRight is less convoluted as a starting point in my opinion though of course there are limitless ways to go about doing this. For example I definitely try to fit the Right zone into a NPS format to cater specifically to that way of practicing and hence the base pattern doesnt extend onto the high E string. Its really intentionally built to constrain into two octaves to avoid confusion.,Guitar,d4n8wv0,3,t5_2qi79

8142759,0,t1_d4vd219,gt its probably just a plus so I can get it to break up without pushing the volume too much.Comparing this togt I play different styles but mostly metal Dream Theaterish tones and thats the tone I care most about but I also play a lot of Hendrix and John Mayer clean is very important for both styles.I want to add that the tone I hear from Dream Theater and most modern metal type tones has very little speaker breakup.  The tightness in the bottom end that is typical of a great high gain metal John Petrucci type sound would be conflicting with speaker breakup  which tends to create a looser saggier spongier pick attack.  Bottom line is that it is important to realize the power of gain staging.  You can create distortion in a number of places.  You can use pedals preamps power amps and speakers.  But they each produce a different tone with a different feel.  So for a John Petrucci type sound youd probably want a pretty stout speaker that will stay tight and defined.  You generate the distortion with cascading preamp gain stages.  ,Guitar,d4ve2az,1,t5_2qi79

8224613,0,t3_4s0hp2,You have two basic amplifier designs those based on tubes and those that are solidstate transistor components. You generally find many mid to high end amps use tubes and cheap amps as well as practice amps are solidstate. Solidstate amps often often emulate tube amps either via digital modeling e.g. Line Yamaha etc amps or solid state components Tech  for example. Many brands make both in different price ranges.While tube amps are generally considered sounding better this isnt true these days as many higher end digital modelers can rival or even surpass those. For example Ive gone from high end Diezel amps to just using an AxeFx  modeler for all my amp tones.Then you have your classic amp tones note that these are just generalizations and not the only thing they do. . Fender amps. Known for their excellent clean tones and a popular platform to use if you want to use pedals for overdrive and whatnot. . Marshall amps. Known as the British rock tone they are more overdrive oriented with a strong midrange and highs.. Vox amps. Beatles and Queens Brian May are the poster childs for these amps and they are often considered the British clean their tones range from bright jangle to singing overdrive.. Mesa amps. Known for smooth overdrive ala Santana to huge bassy heavy tones with their Rectifier series.There are tons of other brands as well as different amps from each brand but many are based on some of these classics. Digital modeling amps pretty much always have amp models that emulate some of these. Its really often the variations of these basic tones that are actually the best amps as many Marshalls have to be turned to ridiculously loud levels to sound great and many Fender or Vox amps may not be all that versatile on their own. So youd probably want to choose what kind of tone you like and then figure out a modern example of these as those usually have better master volumes so they sound good at lower levels as well as more controls for sculpting your sound. For example Mesas can do very Fender style cleans depending on the model.Then you have your amp setups which are basically either a combo amp and speaker in same enclosure or an amp called an amp head  separate cabinet with speakers in it. A halfstack is a x speaker cab four  speakers. A fullstack would be two of those piled on top of each other  a setup that looks cool on stage but is mostly just prop cabs these days as its not useful in any real venue with modern PA speakers. The idea behind combo amps is that they are easier to haul around but in reality they are often worse than moving a separate head and a cab as there is more weight to one object. I like a head and x cab setup the best as its still fairly compact and lightweight for combos anything beyond x is a backbreaker to move. Different speaker cabinets and the number of speakers have an effect on sound basically more speakers in a bigger enclosure usually sounds bigger but its a question of what is reasonable to move around vs what sounds best. Most people dont need a halfstack.Your choice of amp is hugely important as it has a big influence on your sound. You have to consider what you will use it for. If you play at home a digital modeler is often the best choice as it also lets you use it with headphones and many models offer easy recording to the computer. They also provide effects and extensive tone shaping a lot more than most regular amps can do. If youre on a budget I highly recommend you check out the Yamaha THR as its a perfect home amp sounds good and doesnt cost much. If you plan to play live then you need to choose something that has enough power to stand out in the mix on stage so youre going to want a  W amp and a cabinet of your choice. For small to medium venues a x or x is plenty. There are also plenty of low wattage W or less tube amps available for not that much money but Im not a fan of those I find that their bigger W brethren often sound bigger even when turned down plus they provide more channels and EQ options. Just know that wattage does not equal volume even a W amp turned up can be very loud.,Guitar,d55msm0,5,t5_2qi79

A nut can be improperly cut a neck may be way out of adjustment pickups can be entirely too high and poorly adjusted saddles can make open strings sound right when the same strings fretted at the th will be WAY sharp.In tune can mean different things on different parts of the neck.

8263567,0,t1_d5afxbg,I agree to an extent. My first guitar was a midlate s Yamaha FG that was given to me for my th birthday by a good family friend of ours. Said family friend has been playing guitar since forever and the plan was for him to give me lessons. Now those old Yamahas are great old guitars but mine had thin worn out frets  and a sky high action. Due to this it was exceedingly difficult for me to play and I lost interest after a couple of lessons.Fast forward  or  years and I get motivated to try again. I teach myself how to change strings and tune up my old Yamaha and find someone to give me lessons. It goes pretty well but it was still quite difficult to play. I saved up some money and got a Squier Strat pack and that proved much easier to play then not long after that I picked up an Ibanez acoustic electric that played really nicely and my playing took off after that.Whats funny is that roughly  or  years down the road I still have all  of those guitars among a few others and out of the  the Yamaha is the only one I bother playing these days. My Takamine sounds better and plays a whole lot better but my old Yamaha is a gteat guitar to just leave next to the couch and fool around on without having to worry about if it gets knocked over or someonesomething bumps into it.,Guitar,d5ai4ue,1,t5_2qi79

You will get better but only if you dive in and get the experience. You dont have to nail that awesome solo perfect to contribute to the overall sound. Hell a single strum per bar will sound great with other instruments. A few licks on a scale in the right key will add to the music. You will meet all types of people good and bad. Let the bad go and keep up with the good.Go go and find others to jam with right now. Check Craigslist local music shops notice board and group music classes.  Thats the point isnt it? To make music?

8400377,0,t3_4up7gp,Your description fits PAF patent applied for pickups pretty well. These are the original humbuckers. Since most PAF pickups will use similar designs a lower DC resistance will typically be brighter. I dont find an underwound PAF to be muddy. Seymour Duncan  or Pearly Gates are popular options. Dimarzio has a few PAF types as well such as the th Anniversary set. Any maker that sells a well thought of PAF set would probably do. If you wanted something a tad brighter still I love the Dimarzio EJ custom. Another option I like that is Gibson  classics. Some people pull these out of their guitars but they would pretty good to me stock. Maybe just a bit smoother and warmer than some other PAFs I like which have more high end. Keep in mind that foreign guitars often have shit electronics and this can also be the cause of muddiness. So if you switch pickups and have the same problem the electronics could be to blame. ,Guitar,d5rldjv,2,t5_2qi79

Modal jazz for example is jazz that emphasizes the Dorian mode or perhaps the PhrygianWhich is the common context and definition Ive been using.Also I said the Greek scales were derived from Greece not that they were aurally identical.

8476697,0,t3_4v1r8a,I have a question about amps. Currently I own a Fender blues deluxe  tube amp a Line spider  head with a speaker cabinetprobably  s maybe  s need to check that actually and a small line  spider IV practice amp. Ive got a footswitch for all the amps that works with them natively. Apart from that Ive got a boss tuner pedal and an Ibanez tubescreamer pedal.To this point Ive enjoyed the flexibility that the Line  amps give me but maybe not so much the sound. In particular volume changes when switching between them and trying to get those transitions working together smoothly. Id like to learn more about how to use the fender but there are a few things I dont know about that I need a little guidance on. First  I need a little instruction on the preamp functionality on the Fender amp. I dont know what this function does or if it means Id be able to run the effects from the Spiders through the fender or if its for using other effects pedals and boards while bypassing any amp models those may have. Just a little confused on what I can do with that function. Second  The Fender has a speaker output on the back where it appears you can run the amp to another set of speakers but Im very wary of trying anything with that because Im still learning about ohms and what speakers can be compatible and where. The user guide for the Fender wasnt much help. Finally  Should I alter my approach altogether when thinking about using the tube amp? I dont particularly like anything but the clean sound that it gives me. I play heavier rock music so Im very particular about my distorted sound and really look for that to be just right. Does this mean I need to start researching individual distortion pedals or perhaps even a multi effect pedal to pair with the Fender? Im sure most of this is fairly simple but it feels like a whole other world trying to move away from the solid state to the tube and not being completely satisfied with either side so far. Thanks for reading and any help. ,Guitar,d614npi,2,t5_2qi79

Distortion Fade and tone are the ones to start playing with. I would look up a few guides on some more popular set ups ones that tend to be played in lots of songs.

Now before you start playing nod your head every OTHER click. so your head will effectively be nodding at  bpm. dont start playing until you can precisely keep steady time with your neck at that speed. youre now training your body to be in time with something slower relative to something faster that your brain already understands. turn the metronome off and keep your head nodding at the same speed. wait a few minutes. turn the metronome back on are you still with it? if so grab your guitar keep nodding your head and just let some standard chords flow from your hands nice and slow every four beats. try to feel each string get plucked by the pick. be sure to just strum once every four beats. pretty slow huh? now fill the voids with some cool stuff between each of the chords. do this a bunch. doesnt matter how fast the stuff is between the chords as long as you keep nodding your head at bpm and you let the rhythm FLOW from you instead of FIRE OUT of you. Its a zen type thing. Meditation really. you have to be one with the slowness. its really easy to fall back into the speed riffs. but keep doing this exercise until it just comes natural. this is how i learned to play slow without becoming a pothead like all my friends.,Guitar,d65tgfi,6,t5_2qi79

That filtering used to be called speaker emulation back before we had impulse responses.  In my experience its possible to do that filtering after capture and theres nothing wrong with the cheaper DI boxes they just dont sound like what you expect and they never will.Again good job depends on what you want the DI to do.  If you just want an attenuated version of the signal coming out of your amp you can get that for  and it will do a good job.

8605316,0,t1_d6h6arf,Well yeah... If you tune down to D standard then yes your C would be a concert Bb same as a horn. But so what?That is not the reason a guitarist would tune down to play along with horns. What you call the notes in your head makes zero difference while youre playing.The reason to tune down for playing along with horns playing in concert Eb is that an E is the lowest note you can play on a guitar in standard tuning which means the closest you can get to the tonic on your low and high E string is the th fret. Not very useful.If you tune down to Eb standard then you can use both open E strings to play the tonic which gives you a lot more flexibility. Similarly the open A concert Ab is now your subdominant your open D concert Db is now your subtonic etc for all six strings. It makes a lot of chord voicings easier to play and allows you to use open voicings that use open strings.The reason to tune down is not so that you dont have to explain your transposition to horn players when youre like discussing what notes are called what compared to concert pitch.Its because playing in Eb is a pain in the butt in E standard tuning.,Guitar,d6h9c46,5,t5_2qi79

If it was DId in instead of through a tube amp we could listen on quality monitors or headphones through a DAW and not on YouTube we might be able to tell.

Play one note of whatever it is youre practicing for every beat of the metronome. Keep practicing your exercise until youre comfortable playing  note per beat for the whole thing. Then kick the metronome up to  bpm. Again play one note for every beat of the metronome until youre comfortable. Now keep incrementing in units of  or whatever until you get up to  bpm. When youre comfortable playing  note per beat at  bpm drop the metronome back down to  bpm. Now play  notes for every beat instead of one. The rhythm and tempo are different but  notes at  bpm should sound exactly the same as  note at  bpm. Now slowly work your way up to  bpm in increments of  or so.

8645503,0,t1_d6m5neq,Low wattage is fine. The gain comes from the preamp tubes then the poweramp tubes determine the loudness. So high gain is not too dependent on the overall power. There is a sweet spot where you overdrive the power tubes at high volumes so you could say low wattage is actually better although its actually really hard to get into this zone unless you have no neighbours. Im not sure if Im the best person to recommend an amp but you can try Blackstar or Orange. But maybe also search the subreddit or just google for similar questions. ,Guitar,d6mas3o,1,t5_2qi79

8648551,0,t3_4yc8vn,the pick ups have magnets poles that have a coil of wire wrapped around the group of them. When the string vibrates it moves past the poles in one direction and then the other direction. This movement changes the magnetic flux and induces a signal current in the wire. this current is then passed through the instrument cable to the amplifier which takes the signal amplifies it and puts it out through a speaker. The frequency with which the string vibrates is dictated by the tension on the string via tuning and fret pressed and certain notes take up a certain frequency. ,Guitar,d6mois7,3,t5_2qi79

8660280,0,t3_4yip77,Ill be the oddball. I have done both. Id rather have  very nice guitar.I used to have a few MIM Fenders and an Epiphone Dot that I modded to be pretty nice but there was always a lot that was wrong with them. I liked them but I was not in love with them. They have since been sold and I picked up  MJT Tele to my specs and a custom Danocaster Strat.The Danocaster a high end guitar is leaps and bounds a better guitar. It has the best feeling neck Ive ever played in my life the neck is French polished and the fretboard edgesfret ends are rolled significantly. The Arcane pickups are well balanced and emanate this low output snappiness that you get from a s Strat. The entire guitar is very lightly aged to look and feel the way an old guitar is supposed to feel. All of the hardware is top of the shelf. I got to pick what color and wood types I wanted and ended up with a  pound jewel of a guitar. Seriously couldnt be any happier.I would rather play my one Danocaster than any number of  guitars.

8660482,0,t3_4yj4kn,jimi said this  the blues is easy to play but hard to feel  the difference honestly  is in you. You can feel the blues and let that come out. your blues is different than everything else out there.   yes its important to listen to others because you get a feel for  where things should go where you should resolve to how to build tension in the blues etc. so keep playing and sometimes when you feel it itll all come out in your playing. Biggest thing i see people who have issues with phrasing etc. is they try to play too  much and try to squeeze in too many notes the blues need to breathe it needs time to evolve for you. Try  keeping the  number of sequential notes to a bare minimum this has really helped me.  Personally my playing is suspect but ive been a blues lover for over  years and as such  i can hear in my head where i want to go before i go there i usually just dont sound great getting there. lol   ,Guitar,d6o6drq,1,t5_2qi79

If you can nail it with your voice then you know that youre clear on what you should be doing with your guitar.  Then it becomes practical or mechanical  considerations as to how to play it.  In your singing and then your playing focus on slow and accurate before increasing your speed and be patient these things arent easy.

8715718,0,t3_4z6y1c,Ok so after  replies Im sure a great deal of what Im going to say has already been said but I feel compelled to respond anyway. gtFirst of all i am almost  years old and whole family claims its too late to make any decent progress i already googled that its never too late so that one is not bothering me too much and that gtim not a teenager anymore to make such crazy ideas.Ive been teaching guitar for  years now. My youngest student was  my oldest was . Ive seen a  year old with no musical experience cover Satch Boogie to near perfection after only  years of playing.  Starting later in life does have disadvantages and will require you to be more efficient about how you practice and will also require you to be a little bit more cautious about things like tension in handsarmsshoulders just to avoid any injuries.  But really even with just a few minutes of focused practice every day its entirely possible for you to become an extremely competent guitarist.Despite peoples strangely warped perception the guitar is no different than any other new hobby. People take up new hobbies all the time painting writing building cars in their garage knitting sewing photography yoga gaming etc... They all have a learning curve and take time to become good at and the guitar is no different.gtMy wifes friend says we live in an apartment and its impossible for me to play guitar in such place. I told him that i checked few websites and there are smaller amps that are not too loud but he gtsaid he knows a pro guitar player and that guy told him its only for people who already KNOW how to play guitar so they can practice and its pointless to learn how to play in an apartment.Apartment living and the guitar are never an ideal combination but there are plenty of ways around the problem. Most of us learned to play guitar on those crappy practice amps meant to be played at apartment volumes.  Anyone who says they know a guy who says probably has no clue what theyre saying. There are plenty of practice amps that are sufficient. Any solid state amp will work at virtually any volume. There are even tube amps that will sound absolutely killer at quiet volumes just ignore the people who talk about X amount of wattage being too loud theres no truth to it just test everything at the volume you intend to play thats the quickest way to find out what works and what doesnt. Hell I spent most of my first few years learning the electric unplugged. I still practice frequently without plugging in at all. There is also software like Bias that sounds absolutely great and will allow you to use your computer speakers or headphones to practice. Also when you become a bit more proficient you can always find others who play and go jam at your local hourly jam space. gtAnother attempt to discourage me was made by another friend who invited me to his house and made me play Guitar Hero. He said if i cant clear a stage on hard mode or something then i gtshould give up buying a guitar because if You are not good in GH You wont have much luck with real guitar. Obviously i failed.My wife loves Guitar Hero and Ive gotten good enough to be able to play expert. First and most importantly theres almost zero correlation between GH and Guitar.  It can help a bit with your rhythm and timing and it of course will build finger independence and dexterity  in the same way that learning to type on a keyboard will help develop finger dexterity and independence. But yeah theres really very little in common between the two. Not only that but even if youre a good guitarist it would take hours upon hours upon hours to reach hard or expert difficulty. So yeah your friend is clueless.gtI cant dance and i have low sense of rhytm. My wife says she has the same issue and her music teacher  years ago said such people should not play any instruments so she gave up on gtthat idea and is telling me i should do the same because its impossible to learn how to sense rhythm.I absolutely despise music teachers who say such things. Its ignorant and close minded.  Some people definitely have more of an innate affinity for rhythm than others but anything can be learned I mean I still cant dance but somehow I can play guitar bass and drums in time.  There are plenty of practice routines out there meant to build your feel for rhythm and at worst it may just mean you need to spend a bit of time with a metronome but Ive seen people with catastrophically bad rhythm fix it with just a bit of time and dedication. gtI never studied music never held instrument in my hands so i am not sure if such people should even try. I also believe my hands are clumsy.As with everything else its just a matter of practice. You want to talk about clumsy hands? My writing and printing are atrocious I cant draw I cant cut straight edges with scissors or power tools for that matter. Pretty much everything I do with my hands is horrible. Yet... I can play a guitar. Its just practice. gtLast issue would be probably money...some people say i should just buy cheapest possible guitar and others claim you should buy something in the middle range to enjoy and not get gtdiscouraged with chinese junk. Also some souces say i do not need an amp at the beginning while others say to buy whole set with amp accessories pedals and i do not even know what it gtdoes yet.It depends on your location but renting could be a good option at least until you know if this is something you want to stick with.  Failing that buying used off craiglist isnt a bad idea provided you can find a friend who plays or people here to help you find something thats a decent deal. Generally speaking if you do a bit of research you should be able to sell anything for roughly the same as you bought it for. Now personally I do feel that going too cheap is bad. Cheap guitars can have tuning issues or just be horrible to play or learn on. But you dont need to spend a ton of money either.  Personally I would avoid any guitar with a whammy bar  tremolo to start with. I would also stay far far away from guitaramp combos.  Here in Canada you can buy a decent Epiphone or PRS SE for anywhere from  used off Craiglist.  For an amp Ive seen older Fender Mustangs Blackstars and Peavey Vypyrs for anywhere from  used. Which basically puts you between   Canadian dollar anyway... Which is still a bit of an investment but being able to sell for the same as you bought for means theres little risk of loss to you. You could also buy a decent guitar and just rent a number of amps. You could also go with software like Bias which I think is  and honestly I think it sounds better than most cheap amps assuming youve got decent speakersheadphones.  Youd also need an interface but you can pick up a cheap used one for . Rocksmith is definitely a great option too. It can really help motivate you to keep playing and practicing. Anyway I apologize again if this has all been covered. ,Guitar,d6v3q1w,1,t5_2qi79

Bass uses the same top strings as a guitar EADG so if you know your frets or notes its an easy transition. . Traditional bass players use their first and second finger for playing bass lines. HOWEVER you can use a pick if thats easier. Use a heavy gage pick. . Bass is a different instrument so you cant play it like a guitar. While it can be melodic its not meant to be when there are other instruments in the salad. Play root notes with rhythmic patterns in mind. Typically hugging the kick drum. .

8813330,0,t1_d77800n,gtI have a Hughes and Kettner head and a Marshall Mga cab thats made for use with a different head. Is this okay? Totally fine.  You just need to check the wattage rating of both.  Ideally you want the cab to have some headroom over the amp.  i.e. a  watt amp into a  watt cab.  gtAlso I have a livewire shielded audio interconnect  inch connecting them but Im not  sure its made to do that.You want to make sure youre using a speaker cable and not an instrument cable.  Guitar cables are designed to carry very low current and thus tend to have very thin conductors. A guitar cable doesent work well as a speaker cable because at higher speaker currents they are very lossy and the center conductor can actually melt if pushed hard enough. And in a guitar cable the internal resistance can be high enough that the an amps output stage thinks its looking into a higher impedence load which can create other problems. Unlike speaker cables guitar cables are shielded to prevent outside intereference from getting into your amp. Also while guitar cables could be used in patching PA gear together just dont use them for any speaker connections.Speaker cables are designed to carry the higher current needed to drive a speaker and thus have thicker conductors. Also they are typically unshielded so they wouldnt work very well as a guitar cord....unless you like lots of noise.Source,Guitar,d778qjv,2,t5_2qi79

Assuming metal or rock Ive seen some weird churches is your style I would go with the micro dark as you will most likely be wanting to get the ppc due to budget the speakers will be similar if not the same as you can upgrade to  speakers. If you do this try vintage  Laney cabs as they are cheap and really good for heavy tones.You can get some good pushed clean sounds from the micro dark too but ultimately it is a toss up between the two if you know how to dial a tone well.

Please understand that I know very little about guitars in general especially electrics as I try and fail to explain!Whenever I play it be it hooked up to my amp or interface a shitty Fender Frontman and a Focusrite Scarlett i respectively it sounds extremely bassy and garbled. Im not super sure what the tone knobs do on it but this persists no matter where theyre at with only menial differences in tone at any setting. If I attempt to play a chord it just sounds like garbled muffled trash.With the identical setup I have a decrepit Squier Strat that sat in a basement for  years awaiting the return of christ and it sounds crystal clear over both the amp and the interface.Am I playing it wrong or is something up with this guitar?

8857551,0,t3_51jyyr,To me the best way to look at Modes is to consider them as the variations of standard diatonic  notes scale. The concept is pretty simple start with learning natural major and minor scale dont just memorize some shapes the most important thing here is to learn their intervals and really get the sound in your head.After learning natural major and minor scale proceed learning other modes because all of those modes will be just one note variation of natural major and minor scale except Ionian because it is same as major scale Aeolian because it is just another name for minor scale and Locrian because it is a weird minor type scale with flattened  th and th isnt supposed to be changed in natural major and minor scale.Learning Modes isnt that difficult because the concept is quite simple but most difficult part is to use them to bring out their colors in solos and riffs.,Guitar,d7cjwix,4,t5_2qi79

If not my quick and easy suggestion would be just to block the tremolo for that tuning. Im by no means an expert on these but after tuning and retuning mine it takes a solid half an hour to get the bridge sitting flat and close enough to in tune that you can tweak it without bottoming or topping out the fine adjustments on the bridge.Are you familiar with the TremelNo?

8915421,0,t3_52cgdh,There are some nice little tube amp kits you can get that are honest remakes of the early fender pignose or tweed tube amps of the day or some of the classic marshall plexi or vox tones.  These circuits are so old and common place knowledge nowadays that they have fallen out of copyright.  Likewise with the early effects pedals like tone bender fuzz etc.   One thing I sure you know from your training hopefully is that amps and capacitors can carry lethal amounts of charge.  So if you power it up and switch it off be careful  know what you are doing else you can get a nasty shock.You can buy just the components they often come with a sensible metal box to mount them in and depending on how far you want to go you can build a cab  install a it and a speaker or buy in.Id also second the advice on tube amps these things can be real simple  understood whereas alot of the new SS  transister stuff requires more circuitry etc  which to be fair as an electronics technician you probably have the skills and equipment so it actually may be a better fit.I would definitely take a look at some effects schematics  DIY effects.

8929542,0,t3_52lh8c,If I understand your task correctly you are being tasked to find the fourth and fifth chord IV V from the I chord.  That may be in conflict with how you understand it.  In any major key for instance G the first I chord is a G major and then it flows like this Am Bm C D Em Fdim back to G.  If you were to map it out since this system works for any key it always progresses like this for ANY major keyI  major chordii  minor chordiii  minor chordIV  major chordV  major chordvi  minor chordvii  diminished chordNotice how up above the I  IV  V which are always major are depicted by using upper case Roman numerals while the minor  diminished chords are using lower case Roman numerals?So the IIVV progression would be G  C  D.  IIVVI would be G  C  D  G.For the key of C major the chords are C Dmin Emin F G Amin Bdim.  IIVV progression in C major would then give you C  F  G.  IIVVI would give you CFGC.  I think this may be what your homework is about.  If you want to do this with Bmin so you can work on your barre chords you can...but its a strange key to play blues in again it can be done.  Many blues songs youll find are in G major.One more item Id add is that while you may find it difficult to play Bmin and barre chords are indeed tough to get down at first be careful on your lessons that you dont make them artificially tougher by combining your lessons with an area that might not naturally also include another area youre struggling with.  That can make the overall task much more difficult than needed and can then prevent you from learning the concepts being brought forward.EDIT HERE is a link to some more of the above concept The Nashville Number System explained,Guitar,d7l76mj,5,t5_2qi79

8933927,0,t1_d7lmq5p,Theyre strung through the body and not a big deal to string the ball ends hold them in place no more so than other steelstring guitars but the floating bridge makes tuning them a bit of a pain. You generally need to make  passes tuning the strings if its way out of tune because of the way the tremolo system balances string tension vs. spring tension on the bridge.Even with a hardtail like a Telecaster or Les Paul or an acoustic large adjustments can take a couple passes due to changing tension on the neck but the floating bridge is much more responsive to that and using the tremolo whammy bar particularly for deep divebombs can contribute to it going out of tune usually due to slippage at the nut. A locking nut can help as can a Floyd Rose tremolo which locks the strings at the bridge so once the strings are properly stretched and settled in the tuning is very stable.Dont let it stop you from getting the guitar you want but the somewhat finicky tuning on a Strat something to be aware of.,Guitar,d7lq58a,1,t5_2qi79

8976235,0,t3_538be3,My view for quite some time now has been that beginners getting their feet wet with virtually unplayable super cheap guitars is one of the biggest reasons so many beginners get turned off from playing. I recommend getting an entry level guitar starting around  or so. By paying that extra  more you typically get a guitar thatis able to stay reasonably tuned while playing tuning is a necessary skill but having to constantly tweak it in between songs is a motivation killerhas relatively low action on the strings. In layman speak the strings sit closer to the fretboard. What this means for you is that you wont have to press as hard onto the fretboard to get a clear tone. This also plays in to the fact that youll be building up callouses on your fingers which aid in effectively pressing down the string cleanly.  Without already having callouses the low string action will aid in this process. straight neck. Cheap guitar manufactures are known for having bowed necks which usually means higher action on the higher frets. And it usually leads to fret buzz when you pluck.  Real guitars have a tie rod that can be adjusted to fix this.

9009140,0,t3_53nc15,Theory is helpful but its not the only tool you need to write good music. I think your ear is a better tool because youll always be able to tell what sounds good even if you dont know the theory behind it. You should really be working on ear training.. mostly listening to songs and trying to play them on guitar without tabs. Also you can jam along with your favorite songs and solo on top. The reason I think ear training is so important is because once you develop the skill to play songs that you hear you will get much better at playing the notes you hear in your head and this is what writing music is all about. So the two are very much connected. I used to write a bunch of cool stuff before I knew much theory by just playing what I thought sounded good. Of course you should learn theory along the way but dont wait until then.. you can write good music now if you trust your ears.,Guitar,d7uradu,1,t5_2qi79

The corroded strings act like files on the frets. Regular string cleaning all around the string with a white cloth so you can see that the string is clean will greatly reduce corrosion. The corrosion will create a drag on the cloth thereby providing indication its time to change the strings if the corrosion isnt removed by the cleaning. The isopropyl alcohol also evens the tone of the strings and reduces the dulling effect of dirt buildup.

The easiest way to do this is to just use a really short cable. If you are still getting the noise chances are its the amp.

Otherwise youll end up damaging your amp.You can always use an  Ohm W resistor but the amp will drive it differently than a real cab.What you want is a reactive load. This design looks pretty promisingIt doesnt have a speaker emulator just a normal line. I normally advocate against analog speaker emulation because its just not on the same level as digital but since you dont want to buy an expensive unit or carry around a computer you should go analog.After a couple of Google searches this design looks pretty promising.If you feel like youd like a transformer for isolation throw one in. Maybe the Monacor LTR which is what they used in the kit because its fairly cheap.Make sure to get a decent case maybe even throw in a fan. The speaker emulation part already needs a V adapter or battery and V computer fans run fine on V theyd just be a little slower. Might also be worth it to get a heatsink for the resistor or maybe get a couple of resistors in parallelseries in order to distribute the heat a little better.Itd probably end up about  more expensive than the kit but completely worth it since the cab emulator design looks far better to me.If you have no idea about any of this tell me and Ill point you in the right direction to learn a little.

Sure if youre in a mood it might affect your playing but this isnt a super hero power you dont need to tap into something to play aggressively.There are lots of ways to make a guitar riff sound aggressive. Only down picking or mainly down picking.Playing faster can also have that affect. Hitting the strings hard and in unison. Try to strum the whole chord as one.Short deliberate sounds. Use your picking hand to stop the sound of the guitar between chords. Makes it choppier and more intense.Also adjust your amp. You just have your bass and treble higher and your mid lower.

9164067,0,t3_55po1y,Two other important factors Youre going to want to crank that sucker to get the power tubes to saturate and youre going to really need to pay attention to the presence control. If youre not sure what that control does it reduces the high frequencies fed into the feedback circuit of the power stage. That circuit is there to reduce distortion so increasing presence at high volumes actually boosts those mid and high range frequencies that really make your amp scream. Get some ear plugs turn up that master volume and fiddle with the presence. Youll see what I mean. ,Guitar,d8dm24a,1,t5_2qi79

9165238,0,t1_d8dqqbl,What? A guitar is a sum of all its parts. The string rests on the fret which is seated in the board which carries the vibration through the neck. It affects sustain and a little bit of the timbre. The finish affects how it vibrates and feels. And yes fingers touch the board depending on fret size and how fat your fingers are. The strings dont touch but your fingers definitely do at times. Why do you think scalloped boards and jumbo frets are a thing? Have you ever seen the wear from fingers on an old guitar? Its more than aesthetics or instrument builders wouldnt consider it. There are plenty of things people put in their signal chain that bury the subtleties but there is a difference. ,Guitar,d8dregp,9,t5_2qi79

9174894,0,t1_d8eyd09,Not necessarily theres actually quite a few reasons. In the very beginning newbies should be concerned about forming proper chords and tone acoustic is ideal for that and much more versatile as a practice instrument. Give them an amplifier and a pedalboard and theyll be less concerned about the core of their technique than they are the amount of artificial volume and dynamics they can now tinker withand thats awfully distracting. When do you practice? If electric unplugged good luck hearing yourself. If electric amplified that invites a ton of variables in itself practice curfew courtesy of others around you misguided working on an amplifiers EQ etc. All of that could be completely peripheral. It might be fun and sure you may likeenjoy that kind of music but the gain per capita of time invested practicing is not going to be the same and thats why I say acoustic over electric. Specifically unplugged above all because your tone is completely naturalnaked and you hear what you produce to the fullest extent without artificial help. Being harder to form chords and transition up the neck does pay off specifically for players who want to transition to electric. Ive been around a lot of younger guitar students not that I taught them personally and I feel that my experiences and how much Ive seen certain people progress backs this opinion upotherwise I wouldnt need to say or recommend.Worst setup ever couldshould be fixed by the player personally instead of treating guitar like something never to be touched or tampered with. You can turn anything into a decent guitar.,Guitar,d8ezhab,1,t5_2qi79

9180485,0,t3_562a3v,To be honest no you cannot really tell from the specs how loud an amp will be when turned up.There are two big factors and a bunch of others but the big ones are how much power the amp is putting out and how much of that power is the speaker converting into sound.The first of these is specified. Sort of. The issue being that the theoretical or lab measured number is not always a good reflection of what will happen with a real guitar and speaker.The second of these is almost never specified. If you can find out which speaker is in there and the manufacturer has data on their website you can find the sensitivity of the speaker itself. This would be a pretty good indicator of how loud the speaker would be given  watt of power from the amp. However it is also a theoretical number and doesnt take into account the real guitar real amp and real cab.Allinall take the numbers as rough guidelines and then try them. Especially if you are also interested in decent sound at low volumes  thats another question altogether.,Guitar,d8fozf6,6,t5_2qi79

9190416,0,t1_d8gqhuv,Thats not how it works. Sound quality is incredibly subjective. If you listen to a guitar you can tell how much you like the sound. Different models will be very different also. Sometimes you might come across a model of a lesser revered brand at a given price point which you prefer to a more revered brand. Could be a special edition or something like that also. Its a personal thing. Its a subjective thing. The best way is to go in not thinking of brand. If youre thinking brand then you might discount a good guitar or you will have a bit of bias of brand. If you go without bias you will find the one you prefer brand aside and thats really what you want the best guitar for you.Also idk if reddit is the best place to find general guitar experts. ,Guitar,d8gyaz8,0,t5_2qi79

Every store has a different feel and customer base so experiences are going to differ but its a great place if you dont mind late hours and low pay. As a new employee you will most likely get closing shifts most nights. There is a base pay and commission is structured in tiers based on sales per hour. Typical goal is  sph but working hr weeks at that rate only makes you between   a year as a new employee. You build customers through trust so being honest and open about things you dont know is important. Its one of the most relaxed places youll work but theres not a lot of time to sit and play guitar and theres way to much big corporation feel and terrible training structure right now.

But Mayer has done a lot of really original stuff too and draws from many other influences as well although granted SRV and Hendrix would be his main ones by a long shot.If youre looking for something a little different from John Mayer find his live version of Aint no Sunshine. He plays it in a very unique style that I dont think could directly be attributed to anyone.Not to mention while I hate almost all of it all of his girly pop music is certainly not a page out of the SRV book so I would say while he idolized those guys he still had his own thing going.,Guitar,d8m4ki2,0,t5_2qi79

9259358,0,t3_577un6,Agile is the cheapest multiscale guitar youll find in that range. There arent too many manufacturers doing multiscalefanned fret stuff on a mass production basis and they tend to hover around .k USD. Legator has some fanned fret models that run toward  or so. I own an Ormsby HypeGTR its a multiscale six string. It was around  USD. I  absolutely love it. It feels more natural to me than a fixed scale and there was little to no learning curve. The fan follows your arms motion which is ergonomically better. I ordered a seven string as well I should have it by mid December. You also have the benefit of more even tension across the strings. You can use lighter gauge strings on the bass side and keep the tightness while also using strings that work better for the treble side. Its great.

9265423,0,t1_d8qg93e,Not exactly I use pricey guitars as a benchmark for my own setup work the only way to get good at something like that is to compare your work to the very best.  I have played a Custom  before and yes they do impress me.  Fun anecdote recently I went to a local boutique shop that sells Tom Anderson guitars no disrespect but the Jazzmaster and Strat I built have lowerfaster action than the  Tom Anderson they showed me  and the Jazzmaster cost  to build the Strat only around...eh  with some lucky parts finds.  Pricing has a lot to do with what I do because I started off playing oncehigh quality beaters ridden hard and put away wet Kramers mostly from the s in high school and was finding I was having a more reliable time with a Harmony H Strat copy I paid  for and reassembled myself.  My Kramer was  and had a real Floyd Rose my Harmony was . and about  hours of work total to get fixed up and repainted.I think a lot of the issue with guitar myths is people passing off opinion as fact. The truth is what is the perfect guitar for the job  all and none of them just depends on who you are and where your prefs lie D  Also when you do your own work like I do theres a lot of experimentation  just like Paul Reed Smith or Edward VanHalen I brokedestroyed a lot of stuff along the way to learn what I learned.,Guitar,d8qgiac,3,t5_2qi79

DanelectroSilvertone guitars use MDF for the top and back but use Pine for the frame.  You could probably research how to get the proper edging.  Making a strat out of it is doable but it wont be like a regular strat by far contours are not doable using MDF for example.

9273146,0,t1_d8q6q0u,I cant completely agree. Whilst I believe to some extent that talent is a myth my personal experience doesnt really bear it out. Some people just have an aptitude that makes the ceiling much higher for them. Whether it is the sensitivity of their  ear or the fluency of emotional communication and whether these are a result of genetic predispisition or child development. Either way we cant all be a Mozart. It is a question of capacity. Hard work can make you a great player who really pushes the field of his instrument but virtuosi have something extra. Put a great player in front of a masterwork and hear him perfectly play it back. But put a virtuoso in a room empty apart from an instrument he has never even played before. Come back  mins later and you have a new masterwork.  I guess I am conflating the skills of musicianship and composition a bit here but I think thats the difference. Most people have the capacity to be great musicians if they work hard. You just practice the theory and technique. But the ability to improvise and actualy navigate almost be feel alone comes harder. ,Guitar,d8rfrs3,1,t5_2qi79

Ive been playing for  years almost  and I have bad technique on some of my playing yet I can play virtually anything I want to learn at this point. The term good technique is just a facade nothing else.

Its caused by the vibration of the note you played making other strings vibrate.Some people love this ringing effect but if you dont like it you can try muting the offending strings. Its a perfectly natural phenomenon at will occur at different frequencies depending on how your guitar is tuned and how the frets are positioned. In fact some instruments like the hurdygurdy and sitar have extra strings tuned to deliberately take advantage of this effect. Your individual guitar might bring out resonance effects more or less compared to others.,Guitar,d92p62d,1,t5_2qi79

To practice string skipping you can put the last note on another string but just do it on the same string to start off.

9515625,0,t3_5b5g0r,Ive spent countless hours going over various pickups tonewoods wiring schematics and the like for several of these types of upgrades. I would suggest looking into it yourself because it never hurt having more knowledge. If youre primarily going to be using the strat for the clean sounds and you like how it sounds already I would put both pickups in the PRS and use the pushpulls for coilspilts or phase reversal. You could also use a puhpull in the HSS to get an always on for the neck or bridge and then you could get a neckbridge combo or all three. If you only want to use one what I typically do and what I would suggest is strumming the guitar you want to upgrade unplugged and listen to the wood. Is it bright or dark? Does it sustain fairly well? What other sonic properties does it have? Guitars are a sum of their parts and their tonal properties reflect this. Then check the manufacturer sites for your pickups and see how they are voiced and match them up with the guitars in a way that compliments the natural makeup of the guitar. ,Guitar,d9m0523,2,t5_2qi79

Add gain and you get more of that creamy tone with crunchy rhythm. Neil Young uses a P in the neck of Old Black Jerry Garcia used an SG with Ps occasionally as did Pete Townshend and Carlos Santana most of the tracks on Weezers Blue album werent recorded with Rivers blue Strat but rather with Ric Ocaseks Les Paul DC with Ps Leslie West used a Les Paul Jr. with only one P in the bridge the list goes on and on.,Guitar,d9q3hy7,9,t5_2qi79

But with analog effects youre usually looking at spending a ridiculous amount of money.  And if youre just going to go with the cheapest analog pedals you can find just because theyre analog with some exceptions it kind of defeats the purpose of going analog.If youre on a limited budget I would just go with a Boss or Line unit.  Analog effects are amazing but once you go down the rabbit hole its going to take you a while to accumulate the effects you want and youd probably be better served to get a multieffects unit and slowly work into analog.

Bends not to pitch Legato with wrong timing specially hammer on  pull off because that combination is very easy Sweeps with wrong timing etcPeople who play  by themselves sometimes they have very poor timing.

9661195,0,t1_da1p6xd,Hey man! Really glad to have heard your improv. Your smooth style of play works really well for this kind of backing track. Sounds and looks like youre not too afraid of moving around the neck which is great. Although this backing track may not necessarily dictate changing positions all up and down the fretboard you worked in a couple areas throughout and kept up a good improv.What techniques are you currently working on with the guitar if youre actively working any in particular? It sounds like youre starting to get comfortable with the guitar but arent quite there yet. Youve got some great bends in there and move around in the pentatonic scale well so youre clearly familiar with working with those tools. Id venture into working full scales up and down the guitar if youve yet to break into those if only to give you more positions around the neck to operate in. If nothing else that will give you an idea of some solid landing points to add more licks into future solos with when looking for new licks to play on the fly.And of course I cant end this review without mentioning Your comment is about  posting your improv and  beating yourself up for posting it. P Showing your own work is always a little offputting cause theres always the thought man I couldve done that so much better I know someones gonna call me out on that. But what you notice about your playing is totally different from what anyone else will notice. Were thinking of your work as the listener and observer but youre thinking of it as the creator.

Its a nice hobby but a dead end for most and ultimately gives you a LOT of suffering trying to pay the bills.....Nothing romantic about squatting with some drug addict living on Ramen noodles in a cold room trying to teach guitar to some other  yr. old spoiled brat.At  its absolutely CRITICAL to make the SMART decision.  Engineering is one of THE most valuable high paying recessionproof degrees on the planet!  Bar none.Theres no reason why OP has to view engineering as a boring stupid job.  Quite the contrary! the engineering field is so vast and interesting its actually one of THE best fields to interest any mind who has a good BRAIN to study it which few really can.India has lots of engineers and may be more competitive.  Here in the US engineers are KINGS.  Here in Silicon Valley theyve all moved from India and have great upper middle class lives.OP  .....Stay in school kid.  Get that degree!  Move to the USA where high paying available engineering jobs are plentiful!.  Earn your k and join a band on the weekends really easy to do thru Craigslist hehe.  How can this not be the right way to do things?...You have your path now good do it!! just like other educated Indians have done by moving to the US by the hundreds of thousands.If one day your music hits with people then you can reconsider.  The one in a million example of a smart guy who did it right was the opera singer Andrea Bocelli.  He became a lawyer FIRST.  And as a hobby he sang.  He was so good he could transition fully into that.  But he got that degree first...and then experimented with his passion.  Again this is the one in a million example.  So be realistic.

Buy a MIM and mod it to your liking. These are some of the mods you can do. Id also put in a pair of CS Fender pickups or something like Klein Jazzy Cats and get it setup by a tech a general setup  a fretjob if needed.

If youre on the coast the salt and humidity are known to be hell on guitars.  But either way that sort of wear is completely preventable with cleaning and maintenance.gt The fine tuners have been sanded down and sealed twice.Sanding them down means you took the finish off a finish which was designed to prevent rust like this.

9707312,0,t3_5e3tej,When I have noise like that I turn all my gains down.  On the amp on the interface on the mix board in the software pedals everywhere that has a gain.Then I will start rolling them up one at a time to see if any of them are the culprit.  If one gain gets to max with little or no noise roll it to about   and go to the next one.The gain you want to generate your distortion is probably a pedal or the amp do that one last.  Have a nice clean quiet sound no noise sound before any gain is turned on there.  Roll back any other gains that are causing any crunch or distortion before this point.,Guitar,da9muki,3,t5_2qi79

He wears a respirator and latex gloves when dealing with these which you probably dont want to do.A prudent course of action would be to isolate whats causing the reaction. It might even be the alloy used in the frets as some people when exposed to a certain amount of nickel suffer a reaction also. Every fret wire is different btw in terms of makeup.Chemicals is a hard one to test too because every factory will likely use a different manufacturer batch etc of the same material.

9725348,0,t3_5eegd1,PLEKing is just a form of automated leveling but it doesnt really polish the frets to a mirrorlike shine which can only be achieved by hand using high grit sandpaper followed by metal polish. Unless they specifically did these steps the frets most likely wont look as good as they could even if they are otherwise in good shape. Not to worry you can polish them up yourself. There are countless vids on youtube that can walk you through the job. The frets themselves can also be made out of a variety of different materials which may explain the difference in appearance between this guitar and the Rator. Also Lemon Oil is a nono and really shouldnt be used on a guitar or anything thing else you like very much as it contains mostly white spirit.

9748720,0,t3_5ernoo,Id say mostly yes if youre indoors but if its your only amplification you should try and put it on a riser or amp stand to help project to the audience. If possible place it upstage of the microphones to limit feedback and mixing difficulties. Regarding powervolume my Dad physicist always told me that x power equals x loudness. If only that were a universal truth the human ears a fickle thing.Aside from placement. the speakers efficiency is a very important factor. If you have inefficient speakers you can turn up the gain and get the amp to overdrive quietly avoiding a late night visit from the police. If you have high efficiency every joule amp erg that goes in comes out as sound.I would expect that the W cabinet would be a poor match since you wouldnt have enough electricity to fully exercise the cones. In other words it might be disappointingly quiet. Consider matching the max power rating of the cabinet to the amp keeping in mind that you may need to change the impedance setting which often changes where the cleandirty break starts to kick in.BTW autobiasing is an excellent feature on a first tube amp.,Guitar,daeqq55,1,t5_2qi79

9799532,0,t1_dakuuub,Try getting a solid multifx first before you venture out to building a board with more pedals. The Zoom GX would be a solid choice to dial in amp models and other effects and you can get this at about . Since this particular model goes only in front of the amp you only need to get a particular clean full rangey tone and youre all set especially if you dialed in patches beforehand. You could also get away with earlier Zoom models like the GG.nu.If you have more cash to spare a Boss MEME will let you do the  cable method on any amp with an effects loop. The advantage of this would be much lusher choruses or other mod fx and cleaner delays and reverbs. These models would also have amp simulators to get that crunch or OD you need.If you do get a more expensive multifx an advantage of having one is that if you start gigging and your main amp fails you can use these as backup amps especially if it has an XLR output which can directly be plugged into the PA.TLDR Try a cheap multifx unit for practice and experimentation on tone before plunging to pedals.,Guitar,dal05c4,1,t5_2qi79

9821857,0,t3_5fxctg, uspacetoaster pretty much nailed it.For me some distortion pedals may get you closer but not really there is just something in a good tube distortion and you can get pretty reasnoble with the lower wattage tube amps i.e. you can crank without deafening yourself.  Theres also a certain depth in a x and x cab as well you just cant really replicate.I wouldnt bother with an EQ and I certainly wouldnt bother with a compressor.  As you push high gain distortion naturally compresses itself ride the ligtening is pretty open and raw as well.Pickup I dont think will make much difference at all.  I dont think you want an overdrive pedal its a SS amp so traditional overdrive is pointless unless you drive the gain up on the pedal ffor distortion  cheat it.  So some sort of distortion pedal would be better.So to get those sounds good I would save for a big amp upgrade.  For improvement a distortion pedal maybe but down that route I would probably get a multieffects of some description. Maybe the more expensive option but youll get a lot more effects  value for your money and access to create more tonez e.g. clean chorus gt rhythm gt lead.Multieffects are great as they give you a lot of experience you can in the future really create that nice tube amp with a few effects pedals rig.I had a cheap practice amp then a valvestae  bought a digtech pedal and then it took me a while to realise a new amp was the big upgrade rather than a big guitarpickups upgrade.,Guitar,dant2n6,3,t5_2qi79

9864214,0,t3_5glmtw,Heya Im a violist and a guitar player and for most like us the violacelloviolin came before the guitar so confusions with the techniques for guitar are pretty common.Vibrato the way youre used to doesnt really happen on the guitar because youre not intonating the way you do on an instrument that isnt fretted.Try doing it with prebent notes where you can modulate the pitch up and down and youll hear something more similar to what youre used to its more mechanically difficult to do vibrato on a bent note obviously. For what its worth the lateral motion were taught as classical string players can be used to great effect on the guitar and its the way most classical guitarists do it. Its a matter of what sounds and feels best to you.IMO I think that although the vibrato on a guitar is different to that of a fretless string instrument with the right technique and context it can be equally as expressive. Keep in mind that tone is also important as unplugged electrics and really cheap acoustics sound like crap and so do electrics plugged into a terrible amp.,Guitar,datbvon,2,t5_2qi79
9865240,0,t1_daszv50,Well for starters there are just as many crappy instruments now as there were in the s. There are guitars that will break within weeks there are guitars with fret edges that will cut your fingers and there are many many instruments that are just flat unplayable.  Also if you factor in both inflation and the increased cost of living these days then youd realize that a premium guitar was way way cheaper in the past than it is today.   Yes weve got more toys to play with yes there is more decent mid range stuff to play with but the high end stuff is further out of reach than its ever been.   As for the used market? Well Ive spoken to my dad about all the gear hes bought sold and traded over the last  years or so and it really doesnt sound like there was much of an issue.  Quality has gone way downhill as well. My dad has a Rat from the s a boss DD from the s or s a vintage tubescreamer an original electric mistress and a memory man. He is incredibly hard on his gear and used to gig x a week with all this stuff. Never had one fail never had a pot go bad on his guitar. Me? I take care of my shit and pots go bad switches fail power adapters fail etc etc... The internet is a mixed blessing. Yes all the information you need is there but theres also a ton of misinformation. There are a ton of bad wannabe youtube teachers to convolute the learning process.  There are tabs now for everything so no one really just sits down with their favorite song and tries to learn it by ear anymore which is a real shame because its the best thing you can to do really progress your playing.Its also a horrible time to be a guitarist. Guitar is out of style right now maybe one day it will be back but thats not today. Up until the mid to late nineties many bars and clubs used to have live bands  nights a week. They used to be busy they used to pay a somewhat decent wage and provide free food and a drink.  But slowly people stopped going. So they cut back to weekends only the cut the amount they paid their musicians they stopped offering food and drink. Eventually most places cut back to one night a week.  Now youve still got the same number of bands all competing for far less gigs and most places are no longer interested in hiring the best bands but rather the cheapest bands. Hell some guys out there will play for nothing but whatever ends up in the tip jar. For perspective I started gigging while I was still in high school in the late s.  On gigs alone I was making about k a year. It bought my car it bought my gear and it meant I didnt have to take out a massive student loan to go to college.  These days? I make k a year on gigs.  For me thats not a big deal Ive got my car Ive got my house and Ive got a pretty decent job. For any kid who wants to pick up the guitar though? Unless he happens to be spectacularly good and incredibly lucky then picking up a guitar or any instrument that isnt a DJ table will likely never amount to much more than an incredibly expensive hobby. For all the pros of picking up a guitar these days there are just as many cons and I know this entire post comes off as a bit bitter but I find it incredibly sad to see how under appreciated music is these days. ,Guitar,datgozc,0,t5_2qi79

Dont soak them in water or youll soften them. Maybe get a hot flannel thats been wrung dry and wrap your fingers in it for a few minutes before bed. Practice tomorrow before your exam to warm up but leave it as long as you can and play for the bare minimum of time. Stretch your fingers before hand and try not to press down too hard. Keep it short. If you have any blisters now then them with a steralised pin and tear them off asap. They should heal over enough by tomorrow. If they are still hurting and hampering your playing during the exam then let your teacher know In future try to not press down too hard on the strings  they dont need to be crushed gentle pressure is usually enough. ,Guitar,datnxc8,2,t5_2qi79

9964523,0,t3_5h82b1,Hey Folks Im a working guitarist whos struggling a bit with the direction im heading in lately and in need of some guidance. You could say im a bit conflicted on what I should specialize on or how I should focus my playing. The thing is im  and am earning my income from guitar at this point so I dont want to waste any time on something that wont help my playing. Im a rock guitarist by nature currently playing in a weddingcorporate band but have studied several other genres like jazz and classical while at music school in Halifax. Im a lead player and play primarily with a pick but would love to be able to pick up an acoustic guitar and play a set of music or several sets well enough to earn a few extra  each month. At the same time I feel I should not ignore jazz at its kind of all encompassing when it comea to theory and improvisation which i do a lot as a rock player. My question would be has anyone here every studied  styles simultaneously and came out technically profficient at each at least to the point of earning potential? I really dont want to be a jack of all trades but master at none. Lately ive been using classical pieces to work on fingerstylereading and jazz pieces to work on theoryvoicings and improv skills that i hope will enhance my rock playing. Any thoughts or helpul approaches will be must appreciated. Sorry for the storybook post.,Guitar,db6ej6p,1,t5_2qi79

9968790,0,t1_db6vjof,Yes definitely.gtHowever while this is easiest to do with bass you can do it with midrange or treble instead. Its not specifically an increase in bass that defines the difference in between distortion and fuzz  just an increase in peak amplitude prior to clipping.I do think bass frequencies have a particular link with fuzz tones.  Because of their longer wavelength more energy is required to reproduce them cleanly.  So they are the first to distort.  So when you allow all that low end into the amplifier it is very easy to produce a heavily clipped product at the end.  For example if you compare a Fuzz Face to a Tone Bender.  The FF has an input cap of . uf while the TB has . uf.  Much lower bass going through the input stage of the TB.  Therefore it has a whole extra transistor.  More gain is required to achieve similar clipping levels.  And then follow the evolution of the Tonebender to the Mk III where they added a tone control.  This is inserted very late in the circuit.  So you are actually taming the bass near the output  after the signal has been clipped.  You still get a relatively fuzzy character and have simply applied EQ at the end to reduce how prevalent it is in the final output.  And another note is that these fuzz circuits are generally very simple and relatively straightforward.  If you compare a fuzz face with its  parts or so to a DS  that circuit has a whole lot more going on.  Much of those extra components are used in shaping the EQ.  The Fuzz Face just kinda runs its gain stages into one another.  The output of the first transister runs straight into the next.  While the DS has quite a bit more filtering all through every stage in the circuit.  Very similar overall idea if you compare a E Tweed Deluxe to a modern high gain amp.  The Tweed is simple raw and filters very little.  The modern amp has more gain stages but also a lot more filtering.,Guitar,db6yk8w,1,t5_2qi79

9978898,0,t3_5igmua,When teaching young children you must be a patient teacher what is a small amount of information for an adult can be a lot for a child. Start from the very basics main parts of the guitar body neck strings frets and focus on developing an understanding of words you will be using to communicate with them eg. st finger on your left hand on the st string st fret of the guitar. Getting a child to remember all terms we use isnt easy and you may find that will take you some time and you need to explain several times over several weeks. You could try and create a game out of it or incorporate other things your child likes eg. Could be drawing or colouring guitar related images with labels of parts of the guitar..be creative and take note of what your child responds to. A game like Simon Says can be fun eg. Once they know the open string numbers or note names you can have them pluck the string you call out..Simon Says st stringSimon Says rd string..th stringif you catch them out its a bit of fun but at the same time they are learning their string numbersnote names and working on plucking strings. You can add fret numbers in later to that game or anything you like. As far as songs go stick with single note songs to start with that using open strings and dont go too high on the fretboard youll get a feel for what your child is capable of as you teach them. Pick songs that your child already knows easy themes from shows they like or childrens songs. Smoke on the Water actually works well just playing it on  string. Generally concentration a young child has is less than an adult so if you have been teaching them for  minutes and find they arent listening or understanding they may need a break from learning you can use this time to have them listen to you play a song or demonstrate the song they are working on a few times start at a very slow speed then get faster each time until you are at tempo. I hope that gives you some ideas for laying down the foundations its all about small steps for children that age.,Guitar,db8a1ji,2,t5_2qi79

10087295,0,t3_5k7zcj,Heres my experience. I wanted a headless guitar. A Steinberger or something like a Keisel Vader. I decided to role the dice on an AliExpress knockoff. Partly for cost and partly for the experience. I found a seeming reputable sarcasm vendor and placed an order. It took about  weeks to get the guitar. The person took pictures of my guitar before shipping so I could approve the purchase. I made jump through hoops with the pictures. Thats the only way you know they arent just using the same pictures over and over. Anyway the guitar arrived in maybe the grossest packaging I have ever seen. Like a guitar cocoon comprised of styrofoam cardboard and all the brown tape in China. Upon opening the package I was presented with an intact and attractive spalted maple highly unlikely but it looks cool headless guitar. Gave it a quick setup.  Leveled the frets new strings some bridge work.  Nothing major really. I hooked it up and wow it played great but alas it sounded like hot garbage. The pots were terrible.  The pickups were like Mr. Microphones from s. So I disassembled the whole guitar and went to town on it. The pots and wiring were scrapped they looked like they had been in a war. The pickups were a real surprise.  I disassembled them. They were humbuckers that appeared to be put together with disparate parts. They werent potted in any way.  Bestworst of all the leads were held onto the pickups with masking tape.  I dont really know how they worked at all.  The rest of the guitar was in ok shape.  Minor issues really.  The cap on the neck was a little off of center.  The screws used throughout the guitar were old and somewhat rusty in places.  I ended up putting in new pickups pots wiring switches screws input jack bridge I broke the first one and knobs.  I paid  for the body neck and bridge. I put  in parts in addition to the base price.  What am I left with? My favorite guitar. Was it worth it?  Tough call. It ended up being cheaper than a Kiesel Vader and better quality then a Steinberger so yeah I guess it was worth it. I wouldnt do it again. The Chiesel closest match I guess I put in the EMG Het Set pickups pots input jack and switch.  I had to buy another Overlord of Music bridge.  Its not great but stays in tune as long as you keep it locked. I also use really light strings s which helps.  ,Guitar,dbme4l6,1,t5_2qi79

The related product  the Prince of Tone  is just one side of a KOT.When not modded for high gain each side is a very transparent lowmedium gain overdrive that interacts nicely with other drive pedals it takes boosts overdrives distortions and fuzzes and smooths them out much like a vintage tube amp does.  Of all the drive pedals I have tried the KOT comes closest to the character of my JTM clone.When modded for high gain they add hardclipping diodes to the circuit to turn the character into more of a mediumhigh gain distortion pedal.

The guitar she has is one of those complete package deals from a catalogue and isnt very good yet shes been practicing everyday and already learned everything Ive thrown at her and I think she really might have some natural talent with guitar annoyingly so as it took me a lot longer to learn what she seems to be picking up naturally.

10149956,0,t3_5lbkmn,It might be tough to really up your amp game on that budget. The key to going from bedroom guitarist to jamming guitarist is getting a sound you like then making it loud enough to be heard over drums in a live setting. I used to do that with a floor modeller Boss GT and a solid state amp Fender Stage . I played hundreds of gigs with that rig and it was fine. Granted I wasnt in metal bands but you could still do it.If you went that route you could look into a pedal like the Amptweaker TightMetal then pick up a used solid state amp thats loud enough to jam with.

10188701,0,t1_dbywvbp,That makes sense. The amp is giant. As for the guitar it is definitely a guitar. Grandpa just seems to have been using a bass amp for it or perhaps this may have been for a bass but we didnt find a bass in his stuff. I removed the strings and have been cleaning it. It is a Hagstrom II and I have found similar models on the Internet and it seems to be from the mid s. I will get some strings later this week and a cord and try to see if the electronics need any work. Knowing my grandpa its possible the electronics of either the amp or guitar have been altered in some way but I dont know enough about this stuff to be able to tell. Upon closer inspection the guitar appears to be in decent shape. The nastiness on it made it look a lot worse than it was. There is some damage but nothing which cant be fixed.

10202903,0,t3_5m0s4w,It should work okay but you need to use it a bit differently than you would with a tube amp. In the tube amp case you are ideally going to be using it more as a fairly colorful boost that will provide its own bit of distortion but also push your amp harder if you are turned up a bit and overdrive your amp naturally. Since a solid state amp does not really work like that you would be using more of the gain knob and it would become something more like a distortion pedal.  That is the big thing to keep in mind. Any time you see a pedal labeled boost overdrive or  treble boost it is going to be a bit more useful for tube amps than solid state. On the other side of that a clearly labeled distortion pedal is going to work just fine with a solid state amp as it plays to the strength of those kinds of amps.   ,Guitar,dc0k14p,1,t5_2qi79

If there was one I didnt use specifically for anything itd be the telecaster but its a good allrounder. The Les Paul I use for either heavier stuff or blues but it also cleans up phenomenally for a warm jazzy humbucker tone. The jazzmaster is my ambientcleanpop guitar but it also is quite jangly sounding and nails that s rock and roll or surf tone. Its also what I pick up by default about  of the time when I feel like playing. The strat is what it is I use it for blues or for funk occasionally rock and sometimes to complement the jazzmaster on ambient tracks. The steel string acoustic is basically what youd expect it to be for the bass the same thing Ive actually played bass longer than guitar and the classical guitar is a newer thing Ive been doing as Ive been trying to add classical and spanish guitar playing to my repertoire.My taste in music is quite broad across the board so as a guitarist I try to remain versatile and maintain an arsenal that reflects that.

10241568,0,t3_5mnrjh,Two thingsWhats your budget or preferred amount to spend on the starter instrument?Choose either acoustic or electric unless your budget will be for one of each. Actually three thingsThe most important part about purchasing a guitar is how it feels and sounds to you. On top of that no guitar is going to be exactly like another. The best thing to do is going to a guitar shop tell them your budget and compare the feel and sound of the guitar. Looks are also important. You want a guitar that looks good to you. Something that makes you happy when you see it. Epiphone DRs are super cheap acoustics around . Every once in a while youll find an actual decent sounding one but for the most part theyre low budget guitars. As for electrics maybe check out the classic vibe fender guitars. Teles are good to start on because there is not much to them so not much that can go wrong. Classic vibe is the nicer of the cheap fender squier stuff.

The tone quality has improved but the tuners still slip and the nut binds so it isnt really very stable.  Okay you replace the tuners and nut.  But now the neck has some sharp fret ends and just isnt that nice to play on.  So you replace it.  At some point I think it makes better sense to just go for the guitar you want from the start.

That is not a problem for me personally because I like Dave and I like consistency you get when  person is doing all the materials.  Guitar Path is a stepbystep system and things like theory techniques etc. are integrated together which is great if you are new andor need a complete refresh.

10350722,0,t3_5o6swf,When youre first learning to solo no. You play notes from a scale that matches the overall key of the song but you dont want to chase every chord of the progression. If the song is in Am and the other chords are as well. The Am scale will contain all of the notes found in the chords so its just a matter of playing notes from within that scale that will work well over those notes. However when youre first learning just practice moving aroundwithin the scale itself and try linking multiple versions of the same scale together. There are  Pentatonic boxes and the better able you are to weave in and out of them the better player youll become. In time your ear will naturally hear the chord changes and tell your hands where to go within the scale. ,Guitar,dchbbwh,2,t5_2qi79

10356355,0,t3_5oakfb,First I think it is important to try and make any comparison as apples to apples as possible.  By that I mean  dont look at a Teisco to foresee how a  burst will age.  Dont look at a Peavey Bandit to see how a JCM will age.  In the same right dont look at a POD XT Live to see how an AxeFx will age.  If you want to get a feel for something like a Kemper or a new AxeFx then the best thing to track would be the AxeFx Ultra.  Also I will offer my own personal experience.  I bought an AxeFx II mk. I in .  Played it pretty much every day for  years.  Sold it last year to try an Amplifire and now an AX  wanting the floor unit instead of the rack.  It was  new when I bought it.  Sold it for .  Approximately  of new value.  So within my scope of time I would find that to be pretty much par for the course whether youre selling guitars pedals tube amps or whatever.  gtdo you think digital stuff will ever be a viable long term purchase? My personal opinion yes.  If it sounds good then it is good.  Some of those older units that are now paperweights  did they ever sound good?  Certainly the features were there to some extent but they didnt do what todays stuff can do.  If youre thinking very long term  like  years from now  I think thats a job for a crystal ball.

If you can spend less on the amp then you can also afford more for pedals and a good drive pedal or two is great with a tube amp large or small.

10433190,0,t3_5pdwt3,Its pretty good. I notice your strumming in a bossa nova style which is cool. My advice would be to focus more on the rhythm and timing of your comping. Your chord shapes are good but try to focus less on playing bass notes with your comping and focus more on the comping itself. If you want you can try adding s to your minor and dominant chords a bit more jazzy. Once you have your rhythms rock steady which can of course be difficult without a drummer and bassist you can start adding bass notes back in and your timing is likely not going to suffer. But overall good stuff.Btw I just saw la la land Im obsessed with the epilogue song that Ryan Gosling plays when they first meet. In the process of learning it.,Guitar,dcqo6mz,2,t5_2qi79

Its got goofy super chorus and tremolo layers. I has rich triad arpeggios. It has an amazing funk inspired riff. It has that one major chord that sounds minor Eb in this case because its technically out of key. And last but definitely not least it has an incredibly direct solo that is impossible to ignore and quite easy to transpose an octave down which is very useful if youre on an acoustic or just dont feel like reaching the somethingth fret on a Les Paul.No matter what combination of parts you choose to play theyre going to sound incredibly satisfying.Like I said its my weapon of choice when asked if I play granted it isnt too late in the night at a party or bonfire.,Guitar,dd4rh44,3,t5_2qi79

So in a way I have experienced the same issue you face  I mean some of the cats I have been in bands with were great in their chosen idioms but they couldnt play the blues if they had to.  Good luck on your journey man  I hope you find some like minded people around there.One thing I have found over the years is that you can actually learn something from just about anyone even people who are objectively less advanced. Also teaching can really help you get your ducks in a row internally because you have to put your knowledge into understandable chunks for someone else.

It has a master volume so you can push the piss out the preamp and get a voxish distortion without blowing your ears off.

Humming along helps at first too.Make sure youre not looking down at your hands when you play that looking down really affects your voice. If youre not used to standing up when you play get there. The standing posture helps your voice so much.Youll get it trust me. Just stay with it. ,Guitar,ddl33r9,1,t5_2qi79
10719755,0,t1_ddlkmy6,I have not lol Im just an engineer so thats how I would approach it.  I knew a guy in school that did not back the tap out as he was tapping and he broke the tap off in the hole flush and had to restart the part in the last week of the semester.  Half down quarter out...My actual recommendation would be to leave well enough alone.  Most bars that arent threaded either have a set screw or a collar that clamps it down where you want it.  They probably have a set screw hole and no set screw which is a pretty common problem with those kind as far as I know especially Wilkinson.,Guitar,ddlnw4x,1,t5_2qi79
10721163,0,t1_ddlsm50,Thanks so much for this. I do occasionally have bad form with my elbow when I really dig in to tremolo pick stuff so I know I need to work on that and I tense up a lot when Im playing so thats another thing. I do have a pretty strong but light touch because my first two years of playing was on an acoustic with a super high action and  gauge strings which really helped me build up strength in my hands but I also think its the cause of the tension in my arms and shoulders when I play because I was always anticipating having to exert a lot of force. Ill definitely be using a metronome more too as Ive only ever used it for warmups until now which was my own fault really. For the short exercises should I focus exclusively on triplet patterns at first? Ive more or less only ever worked on those for warmups and scale practice so Im not quite as good with sixteenth note patterns. I also use a one note per string method currently to practice sweeping so Im glad Ive been doing that right. For strap height I play with the strings of the guitar right below my ribcage is that high enough? Ive never had a problem with awkward or difficult hand positioning at that height but if it needs to be higher then Ill adjust it. And one more question I know I need to practice slow when Im first starting out to actually get the fingerings and picking right but in order to practice fast should I just gradually increase the speed or should I set something like a slow start speed say  BPM and a fast start speed maybe  BPM or so and just work my way up from there with both?,Guitar,ddlt4f5,1,t5_2qi79

I didnt believe him so he set up both on the guitar he was working on and they matched exactly. They also matched his Snark clip on tuner though it was coarser and harder to get a stable reading on.He had a couple of older pedals and standalone tuners that werent as close.I was pretty surprised. He was impressed with app I think it was called Strobe Tuner but it could have been gStrings I cant remember now but plugging in his bench mounted Peterson is easier for shop work so he still uses it mainly.Bear in mind that most tuner pedals are designed to be easy to get in tune while performing. While they may be accurate many of them arent very finely marked and thus arent as useful for setups and intonation.

As the next few weeks go by the guy keeps hitting me up to try and spark my interest in his bass so I eventually go back to play it and the moment he lets me in the door his wife is sprawled out on the floor in front of me totally naked and masturbating. Shes staring right at me. He takes a weird step to the side and urges me to come on in. I dont know if I was supposed to ignore her and go play the bass or if I was being propositioned because I noped right the fuck on out of there so fast that I almost tripped over one of their kids playing in the yard.

I envision your index finger jumping around like a cat trying to get out of a burlap sack when you say this. Mine simply wants to stay curved sometimes or it causes my palm to cramp up.Stretching your wrists palms and fingers before doing a solid warm up are pretty much mandatory if you want to keep things like this in check mid song or mid set.

I use Reaper and would recommend you check it out as it has a free trial that is full featured and indefinite.  There are lots of tutorials on YouTube on how to use VST plugins in Reaper.  I use an Audio Interface to send my guitar signal to the computer.  I have never used a Rocksmith cable but I believe it can work.  In Reaper you can go to the Options menu and under Device you can see if it is available as a device.  For me personally a quality audio interface is a worthwhile investment.  It helps reduce noise and keep latency low.  A used Focusrite interface is not terribly expensive.  I recently tried a Behringer UMCHD that I got for like  used and it has worked great for me.

Thats kinda the point of playing scales learning to move up and down the fretboard.Can you play Paint it Black completely without errors? Rocksmith is too nice sometimes. ! I did great! nope you got  of the song wrong thats a lot of screwups. I also own Rocksmith and love it btwThe tab sheet with disjointed notes Did your teacher say what was its purpose?This is coming from a guy whos been playing for more than  years yes your teacher may be moving a bit slow but you have the certainty that given time youll have a solid foundation with no holes. That implies that youre gonna have to do unpleasant things such as learning uncommon scales or chords. You can take the self taught way but in a couple  of years youll realize youre the master of pentatonics and can play blues well enough to impress people  but cant really tell what exact note youre playing. I tell you this because thats exactly what happened to me.And tbh guitar can be pretty unpleasant to learn sometimes. Barre chords are a perfect example. Use the search function and look for Newbie asking about barre chords. The general reply its always just practice keep at it. There are some techniques that require you to develop finger strength muscles which you can only get with time and practice exercise. Id really suggest you keep taking lessons it will be helpful in the long run but if you really think this teacher is not motivating you enough by all means find another teacher. ,Guitar,ddsfm5t,2,t5_2qi79

The iTwo has a mixer knob that lets you mix the windows audio with the guitar while the iOne has a button that mixes  so all you have to do it use the headphone out on the interface.No need for ASIOALL. People usually use ASIOALL to enable them to use things like rocksmith cables or microphones instead of an interface. Having said all that. If ASIOALL is set up to run in Amplitube. There should be a ASIOALL icon in the system tray on the taskbar next to the clock. Its a green arrow. That opens up the settings for ASIOALL where all your available devices are shown. If your trying to use headphones through your computer headphone jack you will need your computer audio set as an output in ASIOALL. If you have a dedicated sound card there may be an extra step. Like my Soundblaster Z switches between speakers and headphones via software.,Guitar,dduc561,3,t5_2qi79

10814523,0,t1_ddvfdbr,Youre not that tight as a band you need more practice and if you release too early youll never be able to lift the stain. You should be able to hit every note perfect in absolute darkness every single time every person in the band. Also the recording quality is mediocre find a better studio and producer. Thats possibly the most important aspect. Save up as much money as it takes but dont skimp on recording. I wish someone had told me this stuff early on and if they had I wish I had listened. Ive been through it with record companies and the music industry. If you dont want your dreams to fade hide them away until they are ready to fully manifest into what they deserve to be. Im working with a band for fun right now but I havent even let anyone here a lick and they wont until its grade a. That first impression is the most important this is a time where patience can really push you to the next level. My years have shown me the music itself maybe the least important factor for success. Taste is personal some people will love it some people will hate it no matter what but only if the production quality is top notch. If the production isnt perfect and the performance isnt perfect then well mediocrity. ,Guitar,ddvfwzb,12,t5_2qi79

Because bedroom guitarists play metal and campfire guitarists sing and play open chords mostly.  I mean if your power chords are bad... those are freaking easy.  You must have a serious case of club pick hand and stiff fret hand.  You basically have to start over and teach yourself how to pick the strings again the right way.  Its actually even more difficult because first you have unlearn the wrong things.  So yeah basically mindnumbing scales for days.  arpeggios to learn how to manuver your pick from string to string perfectly.  The mindless ones make you level up faster dude.  I spent countless hours doing so many mindless scales arpeggios barre chord progressions finger exercises OH the finger exercises!  But bout those crap power chords  Get better at them!

10843996,0,t3_5v0bag,I think its an overused and only partially correct statement. The only real change in strictly tone that comes from the hands is your dynamics. Everything else phrasing bends vibrato rhythm etc has nothing to do with tone. If Joe Schmoe picks up a Strat plugs it into an amp and plucks a B note then hands the guitar to Joe Blow and he plucks the same B note theyre gonna sound the same. The timbre of the sound has not changed because the source and delivery of the sounds havent changed. Tone comes from your gear full stop. Playing style musicality and talent is in the fingers. You can buy all the gear you want but good tone does not a good guitarist make. I guess the real meaning of the statement is theyd rather hear SRV play a squier with a line  than any random off the street playing his  rig terribly,Guitar,ddyhcyy,2,t5_2qi79

10862451,0,t3_5v9wj7,The Laney and the Marshall are going to sound their best at blistering volumes. Some may disagree but I dont think anyone who isnt playing arena rock need amps that powerful. The Engl amps in my opinion are more versatile tighter sounding and can get to their sweet spot at much lower volumes these in particular because of their lower wattage rating. If youre gonna be playing in your house or just by yourself for recording get the Gigmaster . If youre in a band or youre gonna be playing gigs with a drummer and a bass player get the fireball . If you are thinking the Gigmaster now that Ive said that but you have the ability to turn up loud at your house get the Fireball.If you have two x cabs and you have no limit to the volume you can have around no one to tell you that youre too loud get the DSL . I had one as my first tube amp and I never got to turn it past  and even at the rowdiest bars and shows they always told me to turn down so I traded it for a  watt JCM .

Ill snap a pic tomorrow and get it posted up as soon as I can.As for the ground wires they all sort of interconnect between the different pots and the ground wire from the output jack. The wires that you mentioned are just a jumper wire that gets soldered between those  contacts on the switch and a separate wire that gets soldered between the same contact and the back of the tone pot.  Your coiltaptone pot should have loop type contacts that you can wrap the wire around to hold it in place while you solder it. Also youll find it much easier if you do as much of the soldering outside of the wiring cavity as possible. Just measurestrip all of your wires then solder them on to the potsswitch drop the potsswitch into the cavity and solder the remaining wires in to place.

While it is built and assembled overseas it uses the same USAmade GampL electronics as its American made line.  The fit and finish on mine out of the box was fantastic.  The only thing I really had to get done on it as part of the initial setup was to have a couple of frets leveled since GampL doesnt use a plek machine on the Tributes like they do for the USA models. Overall Tribute quality seems to be better than the average MIM strat and can hold its own against some USA Fenders but as with all guitars your mileage may vary.  Dont by anything you cant try first and you really should try to do an AB comparison with both of the guitars you are considering.  It can be hard to find GampLs though because most big box music shops dont carry them. ,Guitar,de8qx84,2,t5_2qi79

10948023,0,t3_5wcvru,I cant get the links to load on my phone but if Im not mistaken your choice is between the Epiphone Slash model and the Gibson s tribute? If thats the case I own the goldtop s tribute and it is a very nice guitar that sounds great with the stock pickups. Very well made and decently priced for being made in USA. I havent played the Slash model so I cant comment on the quality but it is a Chinese made Epiphone and apparently you have the option of a USA made Gibson there will be a difference in quality and materials used. With that said do you knave the option of trying them both before buying? I know the Tribute has a kinda thick feeling s style neck that may take a little getting used to at first but its a great guitar cant comment on the Slash model.,Guitar,de97lwv,1,t5_2qi79

11022441,0,t3_5xdzv8,Baby steps.Rather than focusing on some far off end goal set small reasonable goals that you can achieve right away.For example if youre working on a piece and you are struggling to get it up to speed set your metronome at a comfortable pace and play it. Then bump the metronome up  bpm and play it again.Do this five times.You are now done for the day.In a week you will be  faster. Dont screw it up by trying to jump ahead. Just be patient and trust that .Or if youre learning a new piece from scratch try starting from the end. Learn the last bar. Practice it. Keep practicing it until you can get it right  times in a row with no mistakes. Now go learn the next previous bar. Practice it until you can play it  times in a row with no mistakes. Then play from that measure into the end. Do this  times in a row without mistakes.Pick a daily goal for how many bars to learn. Calculate how long it will take you to learn the whole piece at that rate and dont stray from the plan.,Guitar,dehd3ig,2,t5_2qi79

11132821,0,t3_5yy6qk,Its gunna be kind of hard to replicate the exact tone of the Earthquaker but here are some suggestions.The Electro Harmonix Canyon Delay and Looper looks pretty awesome.  Never played one myself but EHX makes some pretty solid stuff in my opinion.  You get a  second looper as well at the cost of being able to use the reverb and delay at the same time.What I would personally do is try and find two used Boss RV pedals and run those together.  Theyll be cheaper and withstand any sort of punishment you throw your at them.  Using that same idea you could theoretically find a reverb pedal you dig and a delay pedal you like find used ones and use those.  It wont be the same sound as the Earthquaker but itll be your own unique sound.,Guitar,detw87h,2,t5_2qi79

11175575,0,t3_5zh9pk,August nd  will mark my th year anniversary playing guitar. I remember when my dad brought me one present for my birthday back in  a  size acoustic guitar. I was at first pissed because what kid likes getting only one present for their birthday? But come the next day I am aimlessly strumming the open strings mesmerized. My dad came into my room to see me playing on the guitar and I think he knew he made the right decision. Four years later I am just learning how to Shred. I enjoyed playing the guitar so much it is likely a huge factor in why I didnt end up with a much worse case of depression because four years into my guitar career I was going through some shit. Coming home to play my guitar was the best and most inspiring thing I had. Five years into my guitar career I have two electric guitars and I decided to play live I applied for the talent show at my high school for my act I literally just noodled on my guitar which in retrospect was incredibly shitty but I felt amazing. Now nearly  years in and I am playing Dream Theater songs some Joe Satriani songs and I have been divulging myself into music theory. I am by no means an amazing guitar player but I love to play the guitar and wouldnt give it up for anything. ,Guitar,deyqm14,5,t5_2qi79

The weirdest I ever desired was the firebirdthunderbird design that gibson has.I like the Bich and the Mockingbird BC Rich models theyre not so metal. When it comes to inlays and stuff though the flashier and more intricate it is the less likely im gonna care how good it plays. Like the LTD EC for instance it is an AMAZING playing guitar for the price but the full body and neck abalone binding which is often paired with that horrid flame burgundy top. Even the matte black one is kinda bad looking. I want a guitar that looks like an EC but plays like an EC haha.Schecter makes probably the best guitar Ive ever played especially their custom shop teles and strats but gosh their marketing with those Diamond Series models definitely went somewhere else at a few points in time.,Guitar,df689jv,2,t5_2qi79

A cheap acoustic that doesnt work for you is probably going to be unpleasant and disappointing to play.  Maybe try it out first and if it really gels with you go for it.

The ability to play as many chords as possible understand theory scales arpeggios sweep picking Travis picking etc. Virtuosity is supposed to be knowledge of as many techniques as possible to allow you to play and express yourself however you want. John Mayer is a virtuoso for example. He not only shreds but also knows complex theory and components to make beautiful music. Steve Vai the same.

11338710,0,t3_61swye,I have used emgs on a Gibson style guitars . scale length neck and found some really good tones. I personally believe that the shorter scale length is responsible for the loss of punch as the string have less tension. Please keep this in mind of you mod the guitar. Emgs will add some nice definition under high gain and low tunings but you will need a longer neck and larger strings if you want some serious punch.,Guitar,dfh81f4,1,t5_2qi79
11338935,0,t3_61qlxc,As far as mic placement its probably best to experiment for yourself to see what you like. I usually start off a few inches off from the center of the speaker cone and right up on the grille cloth. If you have multiple mics some ppl will put a second mic behind the amp or even somewhere else in the room. You could also record stereo with a second amp and mic and it can give a very full sound. And I agree with you definitely mic your amps vs plugging straight in. And I would use your own pedals for getting the tones you want. Youve kept them for a reason and theyre part of your sound. Otherwise there are a lot of benefits from using studio effects from logic post recording. Like full control of different effect parameters at different moments of the recording without needing an expression pedal or bending down and using your hands. Sometimes its just easier to be dynamic sounding when you manipulate effects using logic with pedals it can be harder to do. I try to use my pedals to mytheir full ability and anything really crazy or precise Ill work with logics effects.Some other tips and techniques that I like to do is double record the same guitar parts especially if you arent recording in stereo to beef up guitar parts. Its also nice to blend in effects this way. one guitar part with some delay or OD and the other clean. I also like to pan my instruments so that the recordings arent all center. multiple guitar parts can be on L or R and same with keys. I usually put my drums and bass up the middle but some old recordings would put them to one side too. I just feel like it gets closer to a live sound dynamic sound. And of course you can just pan instruments for parts of songs and sway them L to R or vice versa for a psych sounding effect. Hope some of this helps! ,Guitar,dfh8yhj,1,t5_2qi79

11447094,0,t1_dfth91j,Well thats getting into music theory so be patient with trying to understand it.  The major scale has seven notes then repeats.  If you give each note a number then the root would be the  the next note would be the  and so on.        .  In C major the notes are C D E F G A B.  C is the  and B is the .  From now on Im going to use roman numerals instead of numbers though.Each note also has a chord associated with it.  The number of the chord refers its root note in the scale.  So when I say I IV V Im talking about a chord progression with the I IV and V root chord.  So in the key of C the I chord is C major the IV is F major and the V is G major.The twelves bar blues only uses the I IV and V chords in a specific pattern.  Like pretty much every blues song ever follows this same pattern so youre already familiar with how it sounds.  So when the backing back is playing the I chord theyre playing C major in our example.  Its actually C though because its the blues.  The  means its a dominant seventh chord.  Its just a C major with one extra note added.So when you improvise over  bar blues in C you emphasize the notes of a C chord at first.  Then the chord changes to a IV chord an F.  Emphasize F notes over F chord.  Then it goes back to C then briefly up to V chord G then the turnaround and repeats.  All of the notes for these chords are located in the C majorminor pentatonic scale.  The best blues guitarists are able to time their playing to match up with the chord changes!,Guitar,dftinx7,5,t5_2qi79

Translate those feelings into sounds. Try putting a music list on with random shuffle and make yourself improv over everything that comes up. Experiment. Be willing to sound awful. Youll produce some magic. Rinserepeat. Oh and if youre not already play with other musicians.,Guitar,dftwe9n,5,t5_2qi79

The darkish midheavy sound of the humbucker and the Marshall will balance easily with the trebleheavy midscooped behavior of the DS... but the brightness of a Strat  the trebleheavy midscooped DS  the trebleheavy midscooped Fender amp will be a difficult beast to wrangle into goodtonesubmission.But Cobain played a Fender into a DS into a Bassman!

If you play the guitar frequently and you can see grime building up over time cleaning it once a year should suffice but if it seems not to be getting too dirty then you could safely get by with only cleaning it every couple of years too much oil over time is bad too so keep that in mind. My main guitar is from the late s and has an ebony fretboard and its only been oiled around  times and still looks brand new so it really isnt a huge deal so long as you take care of the guitar and oil the fretboard whenever you think it might need it.,Guitar,dg68hhj,3,t5_2qi79

Having separate tone controls enables preset tones via the pickup selector switch.  You can go from a woman tone in the neck position to a screaming mid or bridge position with one flick.  Again very easy to mod.gtThe volume knob location essentially assures you cant use any form of good technique.Yeah pretty poor technique here  This sounds more like a personal preference to me.  gtThe neck shape is unergonomicThere is no single neck shape.  Also this is a personal preference.gtthe bridge saddles with the tiny allen wrenches is a goofy designHow?  It allows for total adjustment of all setup variables you would want.  gtbut at thing point its like weve all been driving Model Ts for the last  years.Why?  Sure you can get a vintage reissue to pure vintage spec  but there are a host of strats and strat copies with more modern features if you wish.  Especially when a lot of your points come down to personal preference why not just find the strat that suits you best?  Or not thats cool too.  But just because you have a preference for a different design doesnt mean the Strat is poorly designed.  You cant deny how well it has served so many players.  ,Guitar,dg9h8yv,10,t5_2qi79

Instead its the most egregiously shitforbrains analogy Ive read this year.Well then clearly you dont understand what Cocaine is. It definitely helped him play physically faster. Many musicians have openly talked about its positive effects on playing.You typically use the pinky to limit movement vertically to increase precision on the axis perpendicular to the fretboard which does almost nothing to limit Again it limits the motion of the hand. You just literally said that. Almost nothing is SOMETHING. Jesus.And you have now completely agreed with my reasoning as to why its bad  to increase precision  Bingo because you havent developed the control to do it WITHOUT the crutch of the physical connection helping you.Dude youre arguing with yourself at this point. And sound like a smart ass that truly knows just enough but not enough to realize your wrong.Cocaine didnt help Malm play faster? OH My GOD... thats EXACTLY what that drug does.

The first thing you have to keep in mind is that the Strat was brilliantly designed particularly from the manufacturing standpoint much like the Model T which made for more affordable and therefore accessible guitars to the populous. Its an icon for some people though in the circles I run in theyre almost NEVER mentioned.. The superstrat guitars fixed most of this shit way back in the s. If youre still buying a Strat and bitching about these problems youre an idiot. There are soooooooooooooo many options out there now.. A lot of the setup is a horsesforcourses kinda thing. If you play blues or indie rock or dad rock of some variety a lot of it makes sense I guess.

The only guitars gaining much value are the prime vintage models from Gibson and Fender.  PreCBS era Fenders are still fetching good prices.  Of course any  Les Paul will mostly hold its value.  But even these two are subject to the whims of the market.   There have been a few vintage Gretsch guitars selling at high prices recently.   Right now the entire vintage guitar market is pretty flat.  Only exceptionally rare or pristine guitars are appreciating much.  There have been a few record prices for a few very rare  examples.  But overall its a buyers market right now.Guitars are terrible investments.  Seriously.....terrible investments. Unless you are already rich and can afford to play with the big boys in the vintage market and understand the vintage market you are not going to make a dime off of appreciating guitars.

11602331,0,t1_dgb3tit,Hmm well theres a point of clarity here to make a very important distinction Tunings are not in a key so a tuning cannot be transposed. I think where youre getting confused is because in order to change to a different tuning it is often beneficial and sometimes necessary to transpose the song to a different key but changing tunings and transposing are not the same exact thing. So I can definitely help you but I would need to know what key youre playing in. If you dont know the key let me know what chords youre working with and well go from there!EDIT I derpd. You gave me chords. Yes. If you are playing a C power chord in drop C tuning and you want to play it in standard then a reasonable transposition to make would be from C to E and in that case a G would transpose to a B.

Modal chords are different in that they dont lead anywhere and as long as you stay in key it doesnt necessarily matter what chord comes next With no chord changes to be aware of as a soloist it frees you to play any note of the mode at any time meaning your phrasing and rhythm matter more that hitting a target note during chord changesSo in a way you can think of it as the rhythm player rearranging the modes  different notes into chords usually as stacked ths easy to do on guitar seeing as thats how the open strings are typically tuned while the solo player rearranges the  notes as a solomelody,Guitar,dgbepro,1,t5_2qi79

11646417,0,t3_6671y0,The purpose of double tracking is to record two takes with slightly different pitch and timing to get an ensemble effect. So no by definition you cant do it in one take. There is a technique called Artificial Double Tracking ADT. Its really easy you just record the same mic signal to two channels and one of them is delayed. Most DAWs have a channel delay setting that you can use for this alternatively you can use a delay plugin with  wet and no feedback. Adding slight chorus to the channel can also help out not like the obvious chorus effect you get with a pedal. The best mic for your dollar is the SM. Its cheap as far as mics go lasts longer than you will and you can resell it for about  cents on the dollar.  For a room mic you cant really go wrong with a large diaphragm condenser. The Rhode NTA is a popular choice but there are some others that are cheaper from Shure check out the PGA series and Audio Technica. I will say though that using a room mic isnt a good idea in a shitty room unless you want shitty room sound as an effect. Sometimes it works great in your house sometimes it doesnt. Gotta try it to find out of course. If you hate it try comparing it to a second channel with a short reverb and predelay.   Edit Ive heard good things about the Shure PGA . Full disclaimer that was from people at Shure and I dont see it recommended often. You can always buy try and return. ,Guitar,dgg4vl1,3,t5_2qi79

The only problem you night run into is that some of the strings might become a little too floppy unless you have a JazzmasterJaguar type tremolobridge lower tension on this kind of setup can cause unwanted buzzrattle at the bridge and tremolo  other than that youre on the right track try a thinner gauge string.  That free tune up would be the perfect time to have this done as the guitar will most likely need a truss adjustment and will certainly be in need of an intonation adjustment also.   ,Guitar,dgihnju,1,t5_2qi79

Some other thoughts from someone who doesnt play metal.  I think the Metal Zone gets a bad rap for a few reasons The primary target market seems to be teenagers.  The meme would be a  year old who plugs a dean into a Metal Zone into a Line  Spider at Guitar Center and blasts Metallica riffs very sloppily.   Combine that with an extremely aggressive EQ section.  The Metal Zone takes a wrecking ball approach to shaping EQ.  So it is easy to do some very harsh tone shaping. The distortion is pretty buzzy as a result.   It is often plugged into suboptimal rigs.  There is a reason most pro level metal players use big amps with large xs.  Running a Metal Zone into a Fender Champion or Line  Spider is not a great platform for those tones.   Related to above the sound of metal to me is mostly about cascaded preamp tube gain stages.  Mesa Dual Rect Peavey  etc...  The Metal Zone just cant create distortion like those amps can. Boss pedals as a whole are perhaps the most widely available.  So often people who know nothing about pedals try Boss out first.  More prone to user error or just ignorance about how to make guitar sounds.,Guitar,dgippy5,9,t5_2qi79

A Fulltone OCD into the Vox covers the heavier range of my palette just fine if youre doing fullblown metal then thatll be a different story.If you want the versatility to go from jangly clean to a nice bluesy breakup and all the way to metal the Fender will probably cover that large a spectrum better than the other two.

I have a Marshallhead MKII bridge with an Alnico II magnet and a Dr. Vintage neck that I later put a degaussed Alnico V into that Wolfe had sent with the pickups for the Marshallhead ironically which essentially just makes it a slightly underwound Marshallhead MKII. I personally think thats the absolute perfect pickup combination for any semihollow and I imagine it would sound just as good in a solid body though an A in the bridge can sometimes get a little too dark in those so thats more up to personal taste. My personal considerations when I was shopping for my pickups were all the same brands as yours plus the Bare Knuckle Mules and I definitely made the right choice with Wolfetone. Which pickups are you looking at getting from each?,Guitar,dgmnl3i,2,t5_2qi79

Fridays they were sloppy and in a rush to leave for the weekend.   ...gt  I was able to determine that Tech  that setup my first cherry SG noted by the white iPhone case was far better at his job than Tech  who setup my second white SG noted by the obnoxious TRUMP sticker on his desk fan.Oh I get it its very clever. ,Guitar,dgofvdr,1,t5_2qi79

I sometimes call people out and some agree to lower the price while others lash out at you that their heavily used guitar should still go for  under retail price. The worst people are the ones that just bought a cheap guitar like an Epiphone Special II  comes with shit amp and a strap oh boy! Jackson Dinky JS   tax USED and old bad quality made in India model or Epiphone Les Paul Standard  and used a lot or the one guy that thinks his s shredder that went through a million gigs is still worth a thousand dollars.

11782022,0,t1_dgqlly3,Getting that all in place will require tagging... and users to assist in the tagging... as otherwise that is a LOT of work for one person to do. I have this on the to do list but I figured it was lower priority unless the site gets some traction regular users. I agree with random nature of the content creation... many of them do manage that to some degree with their playlists... just youtubes functionality is weak for power searching  drilling down. I think removing the rest of youtube is a good start but it will take tagging to get closer to the promise land you speak of. The other factor is that the channels are marketing for the sages well structured course plans... so this problem is partly by design. Have added a few of the channels you suggested the others are on the list for deeper review. Thanks for your thoughts and suggestions!,Guitar,dgvj3ls,1,t5_2qi79

11804979,0,t3_68dzse,I was never into shredding or scales or anything... I learned to play to write and record good songs.  And thats what I do.  I can hold my own on guitar but I can also sing.  To me thats far more valuable in a band setting than being able to shred... but as many others have said I dont know of anything Ive met in a professional setting that talks bad on rhythm players.  Many lead guitarists Ive played with in fact tell me they would rather have the skills or writing or singing than shredding!Also lead guitar in most of todays music seems pretty meaningless.  At least a lot of the bands I listen to today say they trade the parts they play from show to show so as not to get totally bored.,Guitar,dgy4vmp,2,t5_2qi79
