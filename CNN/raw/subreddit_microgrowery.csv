189019,0,t3_1w8f4o,Ive been intending to write something up about speed controllers but I wanted to do some more research before I put it down.  That said I also want to say something before someone else buys the wrong product for the job.  If your speed controller was cheap compared to your fan it probably is going to hurt it.  Ill try to explain briefly.  Most speed controllers are essentially the same thing as a dimmer.  What they do is they chop the top of the AC wave limiting the peak potential of an appropriately accompanied lightbulb which is built for such an input signal.An AC fan on the other hand is a very specifically built machine.  The copper windings of the motor are arranged assuming v hz.  To properly speed an AC fan up you need to increase the potential the voltage and to manipulate an AC signal you need something like a variac or dynamic AC power supply espensive.  Your house ceiling fans with multiple speeds are wired to different windings sets to allow for multiple speed choices.If your fan makes a growl noise when you have your speed controller turned down thats because the fan almost wants to stop or turn backwards for an instant and then resume again repeatedly nearly  times a second.  This is why they die.,microgrowery,cezyw1o,3,t5_2s5jo

If you take mothers that early youre going to have to take  of them unless youre using fem seeds but that might put you over budget.To get the most out of that setup with a clonemother closet you could use scrog in your tent so you only need to veg your plants to like  inches high.

338162,0,t1_cfedmmf,I assume the problem is that the roots had no where to go so it became root bound.  If you cut more wholes in the container and slightly pull the roots apart it might work out.  For plants that are in veg while transplanting if a plant is root bound I just cut the bottom of the roots off and replant it.  Since your plant is already flowering you dont want to cut the roots but lightly pulling them apart will only cause a little bit of damage.  I would prefer to try this instead of killing a plant but I only grow for my own consumption.The best way to learn is by trial and error so like i said if its only for your own use it would benefit you to try to salvage the plant and maybe you will learn a new trick in the process.  If it doesnt work you are not really losing much and you can always kill later. ,microgrowery,cfftk4s,1,t5_2s5jo

You want to keep the lights around  away. FFOF is about as good as it gets for the money. Any of that cheap crap you see at home depot is garbage. Try to find FFOF locally because if youre buying it online youre gonna get raped its double price online because of shipping. Yes you need fertilizer. What kind of question is that? Choose a nutrient line and follow the feeding schedule not hard at all. GO box would be fine or check out the fox farms trio. I prefer advanced nutrients connoisseur but thats a bit more money. Oakton Ph pH pen is pretty decent for the money.Just pick a germination method and stick to it they all work. I prefer paper towel myself but shot glass works well too. There will be hardly any smell during veg but during flower the smell will rule your entire home but you have a carbon filter so it should take care of it.

421038,0,t1_cfn0tos,Lumens IS what matters not wattage. Wattage is whats consuming from your electricity. Lumens is the light thats producing. If youre using LEDs ur wattage will be around  watts. But your lumens could be from  or more... CFLs usually use half the wattage of typical HPS HIDs etc but will have generally high lumens... Less Lumens  less growth on your plant. Theyll still look really good just smaller. ,microgrowery,cfoemq9,1,t5_2s5jo

But is hid as cost effective as far as upkeep goes over a long period of time?

426264,0,t3_1yy23u,Just get the grow tent and a t array. Going organic soil is pointless on such a small scale. Organic soil takes more time to set up and nurture but less maintenance for the duration of the grow. The main benefit is that its cheaper on a large scale. For a small grow tent it will only prove to be more expensive than if you just get a good soil like Happy Frog and a simple  or part nutrient product youre purchasing fewer products this way. The bud isnt going to taste any better. The bud isnt going to smoke any better. Its not going to be any healthier to smokeconsume.Good flavor amp smoke is  genetics  husbandry and  a properly executed harvest.Flora part or FloraNova Part will do what you want. Adding blackstrap molasses will also make the plant healthier.If youre worried about chemicals then just be mindful of what products you use. If you do your job right you wont have to flush just use straight water for the last  days.,microgrowery,cfoy4as,1,t5_2s5jo

The roots finally came through the bottom of the net pots a few days ago and are now starting to develop those little teeth. How do you guys think they look so far? I am assuming now that the roots are soaking in the nutrient solution they will really begin to take off. Have definitely noticed them growing a little faster the past  days. I have a few quick questions for some of you more experienced guys . At this point is it still necessary to keep the rooting cube wet or are the roots soaking in the water enough. I am just worried there are still some roots left in the cube trying to get out that will die without water. . At this stage should I set my Metal Halide light to W and put it as close to the plants as possible or set it to something higher I can go up to W and move it further away.

861257,0,t1_ch227ap,Good advice however I would recommend against putting a carbon filter on an inlet fan. With this setup one option would be to vent the air from the grow box into the little hidden room and then have another fan pulling air through the carbon filter and from the hidden room to the outdoors. The drawback to this is there is more potential for heat to build up.Honestly if you have a strong enough fan the one you have probably isnt that strong and vent directly from the grow box to the outdoors you may be ok without a carbon filter. The reasoning here is if you are moving a lot of air through with the vent up as high as it looks to be you may not have too much of a smell concern from the ground.

890124,0,t1_ch5fxdc,Great so youre guessing like I said. Everyone here is acting like they know its the soil doing it. OP clearly said hes been using too low of pH water. And has not been doing everything right. He admitted that yet people like you still blame the soil. It makes no sense to me. Not to mention that plant looks like a bomb went off on it. Not just light burn. I work from experience. Ive planted hundreds of plants in FFOF and other mixes. Ive never had issues because I keep my pH and everything on point. That plant looks nutrient burnt but it also looks mag deficient. How would it be mag deficient? Probably because the pH is low and it cannot uptake magnesium. If the pH is low the plant also cannot uptake the nutrients in the soil so it burns the plant. Not that hard to understand if you actually have enough experience to properly diagnose problems instead of just flat out guessing.,microgrowery,ch5glxg,2,t5_2s5jo

To pull what you want with one plant in that space I would veg in dirt from seed for  months and train it to really fill the space then flip.

1134954,0,t1_chxa30r,That was my biggest issue with hydro was the taste.  I always got great yields but Im trying to get quality over quantity.  Soil will hugely improve the taste of your flowers.As it is Im using almost  compost teas.  I do supplement with the GO Box at the minimal dosage levels except for the calmag my water is VERY soft and needs at least mlgallon.  I use this for my vegetative cycle and this for my flowering cycle.  My plants get  doses of vegetative tea and two doses of flowering tea usually about  weeks apart.  I also follow the feed feed water schedule.  I feed my plants once a week feed them again the next week and then just straight water the week after that.  Rinse and repeat.Also with organicssoil you dont really need to flush at all and can keep feeding pretty close to your harvest time.  Another thing I really like about soil I know this is an UNPOPULAR opinion no fucking testing for ph.  I havent phd shit since switching to soil and havent had a single problem in that department.  People on the net seem absolutely obsessed with phing every single thing.  Granted if you have a poor water source or you are growing hydroponically then yes checking ph is totally necessary.  If your water is good and your soil is good there is NO NEED to ph at all.  So sick of hearing so many people that are convinced you have to ph every single thing.,microgrowery,chxaj5u,1,t5_2s5jo

Emergency blankets are a great alternative to Mylar as they wont produce any hot spots. But one thing ive found which really isnt a big deal with the blankets is they make a lot of noise with air movement if they arent put up really tight with adhesive.Also in a tight space like that  if the closet is closed  heat could end up being an issue especially with MH or HPS. Obviously CFL or T or LED will produce much less heat and might be more efficient.

The actual light consumption of the plants is negligible with our current lighting technology. There is three different types of heat energy convection conduction and radiation. The mix between those will vary with light source HPS is pretty heavy on radiant heat vs. LEDs usually use a heat sink with a fan hence convection heat. The later is easier to remove with a fan plus convention doesnt cause temperature hotspots. Still prefer HPS myself tho. ,microgrowery,cim200w,2,t5_2s5jo

1628226,0,t1_cjipdyp,I would say that depends.  Chances are your harvest isnt going to be exactly ready when you want it to be.  Some environmental factors can influence when the buds are ready.  I would say a better answer is dont harvest no matter what if possible until more than  of the trichomes are opaque.  If you harvest at the earliest point that would be it. the latest harvwst point would be no later than when  of the trichomes turn amber.   I believe the plant hasnt developed all the thc it could and if you are too late then some of the thc will start to degrade. i noticed that if you lst your plant it will not finish when they say.  My last ak grow one plant was lst and the other was left to do what ever.  The lst was ready  days ahead of my other plant.  ,microgrowery,cjkeibk,1,t5_2s5jo

Do I need a  carbon filter too or is the reducer there ok since its before the light?I was a bit concerned regarding the smell hence the air filter coming into the main flowering chamber. Are you saying I should pop a few  holes in the floor of the main chamber? I am thinking part of the excessive heat is lack of intake but Im not certain. What do you mean by Opening up that  degree duct angle ? I am understanding that as I should drill a hole for the T to be straight up and down and run the duct through rather than around the shelf for the veg chamber. However I am not having any heat issues with that side The heat problem is in the large chamber with the airtube and the carbon filter. Thanks!

If its way too low or way too high it can cause problems with the uptake of nutrients and even directly damage the plant.

2680628,0,t3_2qohs4,I am currently growing one plant in my closet. Let me give you a quick rundown of what I got going on in there. I was unable to find a xx tent so I made one. Frame built out of PVC with a tee at the top for stabilization and to hang my light from. I made walls out of this bubble insulation stuff I found at lowes. Cut a hole in the top above the light and added an air vent for intake right above my light. In the corner I have a  inch duct booster fan attached to some ducting to pull air out of my tent and keep temps down. I have a w HPS Sunburst light in picked up on amazon for  on a flash sale one day. All together it cost me about   for light  for fan and about  for the pvc and roll of bubble insulation. I had ducting laying around I started out with a feminized seed so Im not really worried about this baby being a boy but if I was like you my set up could easily hold  seedlings that Id veg for  weeks before switching to . Only issues Ive hit so far are that I never made my light height adjustable.

3035019,0,t1_coch2io,sounds good looks like you have watering technique nicely thought out.  Being on the side of constraint when wateringfeeding is very important.  Too many new growers dont know how to water properly andor dont know why they water in the first place besides if I dont water plant dead.  The root zone is the most crucial part of the plant.  The roots are the plant.  If the roots are healthy the plant will be healthy as long as it gets what it needs to flourish.  Certainly most people know that the roots uptake water and nutrients but a surprising amount of people dont realize that roots have to breathe oxygen fresh air to stay healthy themselves.  This is why watering ever so delicately and giving the plant sufficient dry time so that the roots can aerate is so important.  As most of us grow in soil or soilless mediums and in pots we obviously cannot see what is going on in the root zone this is one of the reasons hydroponic growing is so effective as the roots are exposed and can be treated directly so we have to make educated assumptions or guesses based on our timings how the medium feels how the part of the cannabis plant that is above ground is behaving and other such factors.  So its good that youve learned that much because thats where so many brandnew growers fail.  Honestly its simply basic Botany.  Cannabis is a plant like many others.  Good to know how plants work.incidentally once my plants have sufficiently grown roots downwards I like to begin watering around only the edges of the pot.  This does two things  it induces the roots to spread out looking for water thereby ultimately occupying the entire medium and  it lets the densest part of the root ball the center breathe easier as itll dry out at timesOK...to your question Im honestly not entirely sure without knowing so many more details.  From what I can gather here though I would probably lean towards beginning with a straight but very light watering pH adjusted barely saturating the medium with the aim of dissolving leftover mineral salts and hope the roots uptake.  Then I would follow within a couple of days a nutrient feeding with a mix content loosely based upon how the plant is looking and hope the roots uptake.  If after this feeding you dont see improvement within about a week youll be looking into other potential root zone issues like binding or rotting.  Anyway hope that helps some and good luck!

I have already seen a slight drop in price in  months but its not enough to deter me from getting a light now if I needed it in the hopes the prices would plummet by next month. LEDs are still somewhat new to this niche and as more and more companies jump on board and start putting out their own light fixtures the prices will drop. Supply and demand. Think about how much CFLs cost back when they first came out.

Unless everything looked like this you should never diagnose a nutrient based plant problem based on something you see on an older leaf.

Some people do manage to make PC grow boxes work as I have spent lots of time searching about and seeing how people have got around their many limitations. I dont comprehend what you mean about the fox farms and miracle grow are you saying if Im unwilling to pay  for what works then Im just going to be thick and lay  for something that doesnt work?

Trial and error for me There is a hype going on called backbuilding which is snipping the top cm or so of colas during flower to bush them out.

I read a study years ago written by a zoo and it was said some lizards are fine with vitamin D in food but some do not respond.  Possible alternatives to the bulb Maybe aquarium lights are less expensive and last longer?  Take your lizard outside and into the sun every week.  Keep your lizards cage outside might be complicated keeping temperature within range dealing with rain.   Feed your lizard vitamin D see study belowI found somethingEffects of vitamin D supplementation and UVb exposure on the growth and plasma concentration of vitamin D metabolites in juvenile bearded dragons Pogona vitticepsgt The effectiveness of dietary vitamin D and UVb exposure on plasma vitamin D metabolites in growing bearded dragons Pogona vitticeps was studied. A total of   males and  females newly hatched bearded dragons were allocated to six levels of oral vitamin D supplementation  to  or six UVb exposure times  to  h. At  and  months of age blood samples were obtained from each animal and analysed for OHD and OHD. At  months of age plasma concentrations of OHD did not increase with increasing vitamin D supplementation unlike the OHD. At  months of age plasma concentrations of both OHD and OHD increased with increasing vitamin D supplementation. Plasma concentrations in UVbexposed animals were  times higher for OHD .. vs. .. nmolL and . times higher for OHD .. vs. .. nmolL than in vitamin D supplemented animals at  months of age. This study shows that h of UVb exposure enables adequate physiological concentrations of plasma vitamin D metabolites to be maintained in growing bearded dragons. Oral supplementation of vitamin D is ineffective in raising plasma concentrations of OHD and OHD to concentrations observed in UVbexposed animals.gt  Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.TLDR  There are multiple forms of vitamin D.  Oral supplementation was not very effective in raising the levels of the other types in bearded dragons.  The study suggests that your bearded dragon does need UVB unless the other types of vitamin D are not used by the animal.

5195988,0,t3_3m5kwm,How long did you let them dry? You either need to increase airflow or break your branches down more to help avoid this.  THEORETICALLY you could use a solvent based extraction method like BHO PHO or CoHO to avoid exposure.  The latter being the cleanest the former being the cheapest and propane being your median in both regards.  All three of these liquid forms of gas freeze your extraction material and the ensuing hot water bath pressure cookvacuum purge eliminates the rest of your contaminants.  If you havent been insructed by someone expirienced I wouldnt try DIY solvent extraction unless youre very thorough.  That looks like botrytis sp with isnt harmful to humans if I understand correctly.  Another route is to let it dry and then vape it.Personally I would toss anything that looks like the second pic you showed and trim off anything lesser effected. Keep moldy buds separate at all stages to avoid further spreading spores.  Smoke through a vape or water pipe if you cheef it.

5605069,0,t1_cwrmvxr, watts on v ac is  amps current.  Most garage plugs are on  amp breakers with  gauge wire.  This is a potential hazard.With a lighting load of  amps you will want a  amp breaker with  gauge wiring to the receptacle at least.This does not include other loads such as the ac or fans which if intending to plug into the same receptacle not recommended would add to the breaker and wire size requirements.If it were me Id have two  plug outlets wired to near the tent each on  amp breakers of their own with  gauge wiring to each.  Id run the lights on one receptacle fans and ac on the other.  I would also run  w lights for the tent instead of  s less complexity when figuring out your light cooling.Check the attic space above your garage for insulation there might not be any.  You will want it insulated to help with temp swings as uvoucher wrote above.  The tent will have an inlet temp equal to the garage temp so the more control you have over your garage temps the more control you have over the tent temps.Assuming a soil grow here so  gal buckets will be fine though Id want to do larger to help with frequency of feeding concerns.  I like to feed more at a time but less often as this helps with nutrient consistency its easier to mess up when you do a bunch of  gallon batches of nutes than when you do a big  gallon batch.You didnt mention it but make sure you have the equipment needed for feeding i.e. pH pen eccondtds ppm meter.  You will also need a couple oscillating fans for general tent airflow and a way to keep track of your temphumidity.As this is a first grow Id suggest to start small and commit to learning the details before jumping into a couple thousand watt grow.  This will allow you to spread out the initial costs a bit and keep the repercussions from inevitable mistakes small.Lots of good info over there in the sidebargtgtgtgt,microgrowery,cwrv2to,2,t5_2s5jo

5750809,0,t1_cx9xuw9,Well what I did was take about  dozen eggs worth of egg shells and I baked them at f for  minutes and then I raised to temp to f for another  minutes in the oven. You want to really bake them gooddont burn them or go over f or they will burn. Depending on your oven it could take longer or it could be less time. Afterwards they should be a good golden brown looking colortake them from the pan and put them in a coffee grinder and grind it down until very fine powder. I did all of mine by hand so mine where not crushed up that well. Your are gonna want  cup Epsom salt cups of venager and  cup egg shells. After you have baked your shells and crushed them mix all of them together and stir for about  minutes or so. Put a lid on it but dont seal it. It is going to bubble up for the new couple days so make sure air can escape what ever your using to contain the liquid. It is going to bubble and look like it is stirring itself for a couple days. It will stop and then egg shells should all sink to the bottom if youve mixed it rite. The egg shells at the bottom should feel like rubber. If they do your mix is done. Your going to want a coffee strainer as well for straining out the liquid and getting rid of the left over egg shells at the bottom the liquid in the bottle is pure organic calmag. Your gonna want to add  tsp per gallon. The best way to administer it is to put it In a spray bottle and mist your plant. You can keep the shells if you want and put them at the base of your plant on top of the soil or you can throw them in your compost pile or just throw it away,microgrowery,cx9xywm,2,t5_2s5jo

I threw it into a jar with a humidity sensor for  hours and it never reached ...I think it reached  and held. Since  is the ideal cure zone I figured drying the buds out any further would make them too brittle.The buds perfectly fine and it isnt as wet as it looks. Its very sparkly though and my phone can play tricks with light. The stems are snapping nicely so I think another week or so in the jars to cure will do the trick!,microgrowery,cxdrl68,1,t5_2s5jo

5790533,0,t1_cxepgm8,There are a few downsides to autoflowering plants which people seem to focus a lot of hate on.  You cannot uses certain training or yield increasing techniques such as topping.  This is due to autoflowers having limited number of days before it flowers.  You cannot clone an autoflower.  The clones will keep producing flowering hormones and cannot be revegitated.  You must continue to buy seeds to make new plants.  Unless you has a regular male plant to breed with your feminized autoflower. Many of the earlier versions were all very skunky low yeilding and low potency.  That is not the case anymore.If none of these things are important to you then autoflowering plants are just fine for your garden.,microgrowery,cxevcko,3,t5_2s5jo

5930895,0,t3_3wlfym,Hey all a short little update but also looking for some advice. So as you can see they are getting big a week or so I go a bruised the main stems on purpose to keep growth from going to the tall spots thats what the dark spots are on the stems but also one of the reason why the leaves are so dark this was before a feedingSo I am preparing to do the flip and go  but one of the things is Advanced nutrients has all these chemicals such as Big Bud Overdrive and I am wondering if they are worth it money is a little tight at the moment but if I need to I can purchase one of those mini hobbyist packs just for Big Bud and Overdrive maybe even Tarantula as I already have Voodoo juice and B. I currently have Sensei Bloom Coco AB but am just about to run out of Sensei Grow another reason why getting ready to flip. Does anyone know if TarantulaBig BudOver Drive are worth the money? The reviews are all good so just want to see if I should get those before flowering.Anyways I am going to give them more time to heal from this brusing technique but pretty soon it should start exploding out the tops and thats why I think I might flower.So main questions are Do you think overdrivebigbudtarantula are worth the money?Next question is I was planning on running some pure water for  days before I begin the flip think it should be a week or not even worry about doing this? Third questions as far as timing the lights I am doing  right now should I gradually change it down to     or no worries?Anything else you can think of that maybe I might have overlooked. The plants are dark on top because of the brusing and they are dry that Im not worried about you can also see some white speckling on older leaves that I originally thought was nutrient spills but at this point I think they may just be from some result of smart pots  nutrients.

5995620,0,t1_cy5cbdn,Its not so hard! There are many methods of creating feeds of your own free. Fermented plant extracts can be tailored to each stage of growth or even target a def if you know whats in what youre fermenting. Veg feed? Ferment the new shootsgrowth of a fast growing plantweed. Flower feed? Ferment newer flowers or fast flowering plants. For an all over slice of goodness ferment Comfrey. You can just dump crushed Nettles or Comfrey under a weight in a bucket of water and let it sit for a week or two if you want. You can use just about anything. Its old school cool theres really no need to visit a hydro shop and pay out. You can be totally self sustaining and gather most of what youll need just walking the dog. Best to have a reasonably decent soil though. Amusingly Urea is fairly common too though noone wants to admit it. People have used their piss for aeons. Piss in a bucket dilute and use immediately. Lots of bottled feeds use urea in veg formulas anyway just that its usually synthesised from the air. But no I dont use piss before Im asked!rNoTillGrowery ,microgrowery,cy5k1or,1,t5_2s5jo

If you use seeds from a plant that pollinated itself those seeds are more likely to herm.

Or you shouldnt because itll stunt the growth and lower your yield. My experience with Autos is that you can repot them if you like and youll lose a couple of days growth and you most likely wont even be able to weight the difference in yield at the end of it.

6766344,0,t1_d0j8jbi,The soil looks quite moist. If that is the case it could have something to do with it. Seedlings do enjoy a good amount of humidity but over saturated soil can stunt growth quickly. Also add some per lite for aeration. If Im mistaken and thats coco its much more difficult to over water but can still happen. It could be something else but it doesnt look like a serious problem. haha Ive had my share of mutant seedlings over the years and even the ugliest ones grow up nice and strong. Heck one of my Next Generation Sweet Island Skunks once grew a giant stump in its side let all of its foliage die then sprouted a beautiful shoot out of the stump. Still for the longest time that plant could only grow single leaf fan leaves. So compared to some seedlings yours are doing fantastic. oh and keep in mind growing from seeds usually takes a few weeks longer than growing from clones. ,microgrowery,d0j8tjg,1,t5_2s5jo

6800304,0,t1_d0mp0i9,The problem with Bokashi is that the methods and innoculants used by DIYers are usually not the same as what is being tested in the studies that support Higas claims.If this is how you are doing it you are doing more than just lactofermenting food waste and there is probably a benefit to what you are doing but the jury is still out. What is being often sold as Bokashi here are mostly scams because of how vague the commercial innoculant EM is.I am not saying that no till and cover crops are not methods that you can employ in containers indoors. I am saying that there will not be a statistically significant change in doing so over tilling ammended soil without cover crops making the practices a waste of time in indoor containers. You dont just get over sound scientific evidence. This is just not an issue that applies to the skin a cat analogy. Indoor container gardening is not an ideal way to apply organic gardening techniques. Again this doesnt mean that organic gardening techniques cant be used to successfully grow a plant in a container. I havent said that ever. What I am saying and have said repeatedly now is that containers are more fragile environments than outdoor beds or plots. This makes the practice of growing organically in containers not an ideal environment because the method relies on microbial decomposition. This is a fact. So is the increased risk of pests and potential for greater financial loss due to infestations. These are facts not my opinions.

For the ventilation i chose a renson tube vent w with a diameter of mm it sucks  m  per hour but i had to install it without a dimmer for time being.I picked a prepackaged set for my ballast and lamps so i dont specifically know the brand but i seem to have an issue. i dont have a decent grounding for the ballast since my appartments outlets are almost all ungrounded. ive been thinking of manually connecting the grounding outlet to the bathroom boilers pipes or something since thats where the other grounding in the house seems to go.other than that i seemed to notice the heat output of the ballast in use even after only a few hours of use. and i was wondering if i should make something for it to rest on and not melt into my linolium floor p.here are some first pictures sorry for the crappy quality but my camera gets pretty mangled by the hps light p.,microgrowery,d25e51m,1,t5_2s5jo

7883353,0,t3_4na53w,Totally doable Im growing in an armoire in my bedroom. You dont have a crazy fan for such small cubic ftcm. I use a . sone bathroom fan that is pretty damn quiet and a little in. fan for intake. My cabinet has a shelf at the top that big one sits on along with my surge protector power strip and timers. Mine is divided into two sides but you may not care about a separate vegflower room. It does increase your speed of harvest though being able to have one or two half grown when you harvest one side. You may not be that concerned with a perfect light seal if everyone will be visiting in the daytime so Ill hit more on sound and smell. I ordered remote control plug in outlets from Amazon so I can click fans off and small ozone generator one from my living room if some shows up that Im worried about getting going by my bedroom. Or you could close the door but be careful about ozone a little goes a long way. It can kill your plants and arguably irritate your lungs. I run mine on lowplug in wall outlet type amazon sparingly as I need it.

I was in like week  of flower when I finally bought a scope and identified them.They start out on lower branches and feed on trichomes all the way up. Makes sense that you may have them in veg and not realize until you flip to flower. I also noticed that they spread slowly but did kill everything in their wake.My best advice for you is to keep your room clean of all plant matter and keep a light on and temps high for at least  weeks. Do not reuse your soil or pots and practice greenhouse biosecurity protocols. Forbid is literally the only pesticide that works on russets. Its also awful and illegal in many states. Quarantine all incoming plants and spray everything preventatively.Buy a microscope I have this one and check your plants meticulously. Russets like buds and the junction where leaf meets petiole.EDIT Have a pair of shoesboots sitting outside of your room and only and always wear those boots in.

One cannot in any way currently guess the biochemical content of a given Cannabis plant based on its height branching or leaf morphology.

8756428,0,t1_d7070q8,I prefer to top after the th node has formed to leave  main colas. Are you growing in soil or hydro? Hydro needs light nutrients almost immediately while quality soils can usually go almost a month from seed before feeding. Last minute advice go light on nutrients to avoid stress and lockouts and maintain a sub  degree sub  humidity environment with plenty of air flow. Dont be lazy and youll end up happy at the end  especially regarding watering. Wash your hands and wear clean clothes when dealing with your girls to avoid pests. Ask questions when you have issues before they turn into major problems. Good luck! ,microgrowery,d707n16,2,t5_2s5jo

8874730,0,t1_d7edd7u,My first time outdoor grow includes  Blue Dream Haze and two GSC from youngish clones. All are doing fine and particularly the BDH has shown itself to be a little skittish with a few borderline problems that are mostly corrected  and definitely seems a bit prone to minor insect damage. The GSC on the otherhand although starting way younger has outgrown all the BDH and stayed vegging much longer.The BDH is now definitely done vegging for a week or so not very bushy. All were LSTd a few times and have a good number of fattening kolas. The GSC again started as younger clones is just now in the first couple weeks of showing signs of flowering seems to be ramping down vegging and has a lot of nascent flowers and those two plants are hella strong  almost perfect seems entirely resistant to the stresses the BDH undergo.I actually topped just a little of the BDH the other day and did a quick dehumidifying  hours just to get a sample. Interestingly no grassy taste and a surprisingly complex and powerful effect   bubbler hits seemed to give a very topshelf result. Could be a very satisfying harvest if I can keep it healthy.Edit basic info Two plants per very large pot full bag of FFOH in each. Started feeding after  weeks varying mixture depending on sizematurity of plant of General Hydro Flora Nova recommended at the grow store but now might switch to a more floweringfocused nute.

I wasnt able to find any information about what type of wire they actually are. I want to remote mount the driver and Ive got plenty of  AWG copper wire to connect the lights so i just need to somehow connect the copper pos and neg to the driver pos and neg. I was going to use a connector to connect them but most connectors say copper only.  I may even solder them together using that nolox you mentioned.

9672271,0,t1_da531li,i have no idea what you are talking about but hydro is  more sterile and pestmold resistant than soil. Ive cracked open a new bag of soil and ive seen mold growing on the top layer ive also gotten pests from soil. i dont think anyone has gotten either of those with rockwool in the history of hydo growing. Hydro is easier to mess up if you dont know what you are doing. Soil is forgiving when it comes to what you put in it nutrient wise. While in hydro one watering cycle can effect a crop dramatically. But the non organic medium is a huge advantage because it is sterile and free of pest eggsspores. Also a Constant blast of ozone can not only strip your plants of all of its natural oils but can kill you so use in very very small monitored doses.

If the voltage goes up and down then youre probably better off getting one to be safe. If the house lights dim or there are other signs of issues then yeah there could be damage to the ballasts especially over time with many occurrences. My point about the first part was that to not overload your house system youre probably better off using two different power strips with  ballasts on each and plug each of the power strips on two different circuits but that would probably mean a second voltage regulatorstabilizer. Whether or not it would be safe to do on one depend on the rest of your wiring.

9921154,0,t3_5hh4un,No one here has told you the real proper way to tell if you need water. Its by far the most simple too. When you wanna know if your plant needs water and you have cloth pots simply walk up to it put two hands on the edges of the pot and lift it up. If It feels heavy its full of water and you dont need to water and the cause of your leaf drooping is from over watering. If its light then youll know its ready for some water. Always practice this technique to get a better feel for how heavy your pots are after you water them as well as when they are ready to be watered. I would also like to say that your plant looks just fine and many people practice a water when the leaves start to droop slightly strategy when they have pots that are to close together or to large to comfortably lift up. Also  Letting the pot dry out between every watering leads to stronger and faster root growth as the roots will reach for the water creating a larger root ball and subsequently a stronger plant.  Hope that helps.  ,microgrowery,db0r22r,3,t5_2s5jo

10188689,0,t1_dbypr7p,First the . gpw standard applies more to HID and older LED tech. You should be aiming for . gpw with a good cob setup. Dont use only watts per square foot or meter as your guide. Thats old news.  The best metric is PPFD photosynthetic photon flux density which is basically the lumens in the photosynthesis spectrum per square meter.  The math is all on the Rollitup LED forum but those guys have created a couple apps that crunch those numbers for you which is what I use and they are available to download... Google rollitup.Org diy cob calculator and you should find a thread where its posted.Anyway... As was posted here earlier  PPFD is good and there is very little to gain with anything over . Especially in a very small space with reflective walls like you have.  Driving them at .A will push the PPFD over  but then you have to use a slightly more expensive driver and bigger heavier heat sinks.  Its just not worth the additional cost in my opinion. Plus driving them harder decreases efficiency a bit. At .A you will be right around  which is right in the PPFD sweet spot and allows for the most costeffective build. And to answer your question no youre not going to see anywhere near a  increase by going to .A in a x tent.  Space will be your limiting factor not the lights.  ,microgrowery,dbyy0ce,2,t5_2s5jo

If youve been reasearching you will also know that you will need more light. flowering man. Those cfl wont cut it.As far as nutrients go let the plants do what theyre going to do for about a week or so after youve moved the lights closer. Dont make too many changes at once ie one per week ideal Any bottled nutrients will work but if youre using good organic soil and you may want to look at organic teas... and  or organic nutes. I just popped some new seeds and will post soon so people better than me can yell at me. Im using  part GH solution  calmag with Coco.

Looking at the specs though both the w model and w model with both switches on are practically the same spectrum. It might look like its more white because youve become used to looking at the light imo. The LEDs cant change color they can only really go out. Leds are colored with a special substance on the lens of the diode. Having the true white leds on the mars or especially the roleadro not only provides a beneficial full color spectrum but it also makes it a lot easier to see your plants under.

I put  ducting in the bottom vents to keep them open at  for intake.  You could put one of these in the hole and it would really help the temp a lot.  Put that fan you have in the tent directly in front of the intake hole at the bottom as to maximize the amount of fresh cool air you pull in the tent. . A humidifier.

Not actually pillows but I cant remember what they were called. People use them to absorb smells moisture etc. on larger scales. I think the smaller ones were for a closet area and the bigger ones were for entire rooms. If you can get a delivery in time that would be an option.One thing I like to do to hide the smell is vacuum. It sucks air in and then filters it before exhausting.

10491795,0,t1_dcx6pq8,from what ive read its largely about the ratio at which the various cycles complete light independent or dark cycle photosynthesis uses some of the stuff thats made by photoactivated true photosynthesis and its partly this ratio which plants use to predict the best growth pattern  in same ways its like the plant version of the insulin regulatory system in humans ratio is more important than volume.    I think a lot of the reason commercial growers turn off the lights is economic just the saving of electric for four hours every day is a big saving on such scales and that four hours off certainly wont slow down the plants grow.   Personally ive found that plants under solid  hour light tend not to be as bushy and wholesome seeming as plants which get a rest though this could have been due to the climatic effect of the constant heat source drying the air rather than the light availability. ,microgrowery,dcxcsoo,3,t5_2s5jo

10596826,0,t1_dd62z7t,Eesh that article is so well meaning but not so accurate on a few things.  gt Chlorophyllous leaves are transparent to infrared radiation    First off no they arent. Second off nm light is not infrared. It isnt really even NearIR its farred. The transparency to IR the noticeable decrease in absorption wouldnt really start until wavelengths around nm.   gt So plants use the amount of red far red infrared relative to the amount of greenyellowblue    Thats not quite right. They use the ratio of red to far red andor the ratio of blue to green as two independent measures that govern slightly different processes. Shade avoidance isnt necessarily the same thing as elongation. RedFar Red affects phytochrome which has a strong effect on shade avoidance like you say. GreenBlue affects cryptochrome a completely different photochemical which governs stem elongation especially in seedlings. Which is why it is so relevant on the forest floor seedlings are exposed to mostlygreen light which causes them to elongate up and away from the forest floor as quickly as possible much more quickly than identical plants given virtually any other type of light.    gt I wonder if green light applied to the top of the leaf would have a different impact than green light applied to the bottom of the leaf.    That green light drives photosynthesis article I linked to in my other comment actually spends an extensive amount of time testing the difference in absorption of leaves on their adaxial and abaxial sides its all there if you just take the time to read it.    I am qualified to respond to these claims while I appreciate hobbyists like yourself who take the time to get educated and I mean no disrespect I have a PhD in photobiology my work was on helianthus annuus and did some research under Dr. Kevin Folta if you want to know way too much about light signaling molecules in plants especially under green light look him up,microgrowery,dd8zbve,1,t5_2s5jo

You have to convince a hard shell that its okay to open up.A seed will do best at around  although Ive always kept my sprouting tray at around  for the first night just to really get things going.Make sure youve got fat beads of humid air inside your tray if thats hard just use a heat source elevate the seeds so their media doesnt soak and put some water in the tray.Hot humid dark. I would raise your temps and humidity and see if that doesnt help coax your little one up.Also make sure that you bury the seed deep enough that it is completely covered.You shouldnt be able to see it from the top of your starting media e.g. DarkAfter they sprout start their light cycle i do  some goofs do  immediately but keep them under the humidity dome.I like to start hardening mine up immediately I have fully exposed no dome seedlings within  hours at the most.Gently decrease humidity inside the tray until you get to ambient growing environment temperatures.After that youre off to the races.,microgrowery,dda1osr,9,t5_2s5jo

10659760,0,t3_5shrij,It looks also like youve got some caterpillars but I could be wrong. I thought that some of the small dark brown and black speckles could be feces. Happened to me and with them came the mold. Your buds are looking particularly wet in these photos and when the caterpillars chow through the buds inside they love to bore they leave behind dead matter like you see which then rots from the excessive humidity or moisture. Some of mine actually dried right out in the heat here before they could mold. Anyway I would look into some kind of quick hoop house or pyramid to prevent more rain damage and maybe consult some others for advice if you do find caterpillars. Good luck! Edit After seeing your other photos posted below I am absolutely sure youve got moth caterpillars. The feces is clear in those photos. Any more outdoor grows will go under white insect netting and plastic hoop houses in the rainy season. Unfortunately even after having picked off most of the caterpillars I could find  day one  day two  per day after that until harvest plus picking off leaves with eggs I still couldnt manage to save as much as I had hoped. Losses were int he pounds and much more had to go to making bubble hash. ,microgrowery,ddfh1g5,3,t5_2s5jo

10884168,0,t1_de2j9v6,Yea the aging of trichomes isnt changing the terpenes. Also Id have to disagree with you on what you said about cbn. In my experience harvesting with  amber as opposed to a lower amount I get a much more sedating couch locking high. Im almost positive that cbn is a very big part of the couch lock. I do agree that letting to many trichomes turn amber can very negatively effect the quality but I personally have found that letting more trichomes mature to amber results in a much heavier couch lock. But I also have not done any research on the topic I just have the anecdotal experiences of me and the people who have tried my bud so none of what Im saying is backed by personal research. EDIT I actually went to look into it and I found this leafly article backing what Id said  Not saying Im correct but this matches up with what Ive personally found but there are so many variations in weed from strain to strain that no one can really talk in absolutes. ,microgrowery,de2mhs2,4,t5_2s5jo

The monthly sales usually include tons of free seeds and there will also be perbreeder sales maybe new ones maybe some of the ones going on now will stay. I regret not buying in February I think it was  free seeds of various types.You can use Bitcoin to get LOTS more freebies but I am not into figuring that thing out tried and failed once. Attitude also allows you to use any kind of card except Mastercard I always paid with my Visa. Its linked to my real name and shit but nothing bad has happened they charge in a legitlooking way. I live in an illegal state in the US got my seeds after about  days total. We ordered right after Christmas though so I think thats why it took so long. Ive heard  days on average to the US.Attitude is great everything was very smooth for me. I got a couple fivepacks you usually get single seeds as freebies anyway. I would recommend if you have a strain you really want get a  or pack just in case a couple dont work. Ive planted a freebie that didnt pop...I suspect freebies are older stock they need to get rid of so I wouldnt be surprised if that happens more often than with seeds you pay for.In my uninformed opinion unless you have a lot of spacemoneytime pheno hunting is probably a bit much right away. I just started as well and wanted to jump into a breeding cycle ASAP but now Im thinking I should do several grows first. There is a LOT to learn.As for strains to recommend Ive got Northern Lights and Blue Mystic autoflowers going and both have been mindboggling easy.

11021130,0,t3_5xd9jo,Ive seen only bad things about the readymade grow boxes. Theyre slapped together from cheap components that dont necessarily work well for the space provided and marked up in price excessively. I would avoid those.Putting together a tent can be cheap and easy and leaves you more room to work than a spacebucket. I like controlling variables so indoor is fun for me. The thought of growing outdoors scares me for the sake of pests and wouldbe thieves. Depending on the strain Ive heard outdoor plants in flower can be a smelly beacon reaching multiple blocks away.Dont be scared of cheap Amazon purchases. Never know when youll strike gold on a great item. Im using an  tent  carbonexhaust fan combo and an  LED got me started just fine. Just make sure you match those up with the space small tent small fan one light. Big tent big fan multiple lights or a strong HID lamp.Then you get to decide medium. For a start soil with organic nutrients or coco with nutrient salts. Those two have been a good start for my first attempt anyway. You can do soil with nutrient salts as well but I know little about it.Soil requires less fussing over what youre adding less pH sensitive you can amend it with nutrients so you dont have to add liquid nutrients but also takes control out of your hands plants respond slowly to changes you may try to make. With organic soil microbes do the work of breaking down complex food into plant available minerals at a slow but steady rate and they help to buffer the pH. Innoculating with bacteria amp endomycorrhizal fungi is a good idea Recharge amp Mykos are what Ive been using.Coco gives you more control no nutrient value in the coco so you add everything as you water and the plants respond more quickly which makes it more important to control variables pH amountratio of nutrient salts at different points in the plants growth cycle. Plants grow faster and larger in coco than they do in soil because of the immediately available nutrients and the natural aeration coco provides the roots.Organic soil is probably more expensive than coco so long as you stick to cheaper coco coir and nutrients. I started with Botanicare Cocogro brick coco coir and GH Flora nutrients and its cost me much less than putting together a complete amp amended soil recipe. Amended soil also requires a composting period whereas coco is hydrate amp gogogo!,microgrowery,deh7qq6,4,t5_2s5jo

11164880,0,t3_5zd5x4,I have used acetic acid before in an extreme pinch but I wouldnt suggest it unless you have absolutely no better option ie you dont have any commercial pH down products. The reason for this is twofold. First acetic acid is an organic compound and is relatively susceptible to biodegradation. Phosphoric acid General Hydro pH down for example is inorganic and while phosphate is a common molecule used by all living things it is much less likely to be used as food by microbes than a small organic compound like acetic acid.  Second acetic acid is a monoprotic acid. In laymans terms this means each molecule has one unit of pHchanging contribution to the solution its dissolved in. Phosphoric acid is triprotic every molecule has three units of pHchanging potential. Add these two factors together and what you find is that it takes a lot more acetic acid to adjust the pH of a solution to the proper range than it takes to make the same adjustment with phosphoric acid. Additionally you may adjust the pH of a hydro reservoir with vinegar and find that the pH quickly rises because of relatively rapid breakdown of acetic acid requiring you to readjust pH more often.All that being said acetic acid WILL work but it is absolutely not the ideal compound to use for adjusting pH.,microgrowery,dexizrb,10,t5_2s5jo

11312730,0,t1_dfe8n6f,Ok but theres no science to support the idea that your buds will be smooth and clean if you flush its pseudoscience thats easily debunked by basic biology and common sense. Plants absorb nutrients through the root system into the xylem and into the various tissues of the plant where they are integrated into various biomolecules needed for healthy growth. The plant does not expel these nutrients because theyve already been either converted into other compounds for the plants use or stored in tissues mostly leaves for later use. There is no biological action by which feeding plain water will remove those nutrients or compounds from the plant. Flushing can help remove salt buildup from your medium if youve overfed but based on universally accepted understanding of plant life it will not remove any nutrients from the plant itself. And beyond the biological reasons its bs theres plenty of common sense reasoning to tell you flushing doesnt do what you think it does. Think about it why dont all large scale hydroponic food growers flush if its so dangerous to leave all those nutrients in the plant? Given that we know the plant stores nutrients with no biological system or function to remove them why would we assume that feeding plain water somehow signals the plant to do anything differently in the last couple weeks of the grow? The plant doesnt know that its going to be cut down or that its going to be smoked.  Nothing it does is in any way related to cleaning out the buds for our purposes. The plant has no natural reason to do this. Furthermore if flushing were effective at producing a better tasting and cleaner bud wouldnt it be an inarguable fact that hydroponically grown bud will always be cleaner and smoother than soil grown given that you cant possibly flush an inert substance like soil the way you can with a hydroponics tank? But of course we all know thats not the case in fact quite the opposite the general consensus is that soilgrown weed tastes better.  Sorry to burst your bubble OP but people cling to this practice for no good reason its a wives tale. Flushing will not make your bud tastier cleaner smoother or make it burn to white ash. All it will do is remove any salt buildup from your medium which makes pretty much no difference to a plant in the last couple weeks of flowering that were already exposed to the salts in the medium before you flushed.,microgrowery,dfea3jh,6,t5_2s5jo

When you flush the grow medium you are removing the nutrients from the grow medium and the grow medium alone.  This way when those root hairs reach out for those negatively charged ions that are the nutes they just get plain water instead.  That way they dont uptake anything else.

I take bottom branch  larfy clones from the flowering ones at around f... This buys me a bit of time to keep them in solos and just water them..They can all fit in my veg area happy while they bounce back and make brancheshappening now. Its working out perfectly.

I find they can help a lot with overwatering but I dont recommend the  gallons as my plants would dry too quickly in them and it caused them problems for like  weeks. Make sure you water to  runoff every time or else you will get buildupimbalancessalt pockets in your soil that will wreck havoc on your plants later. You want to flush out all the old stuff when you water again with the new. If you do that you should be golden. Sometimes poking holes in the top of the soil with a skewer can help it from being overwatered also putting smartpots on a screen thats on top of the tray can cause them to dry SUPER fast if needed.
