5997163,0,t1_cy5qvoo,Well it depends there are many aspects of the game that are being talked about one that Im familiar with is mining and there will be contracts for mining you can do and be an agent this will allow you to be an agent and fulfill the contract and gain reputation this type of gameplay could also be implemented on other parts of the game like contracts for different types of professions. But others could speak on this if they know more. ,Star_citizen,cy5rc2l,1,t5_2vl2m

7539732,0,t1_d2y2std,Actually it was not restored it was posted a second time.  It was also removed a second time.GlassDoor is a sham.  The truth is the majority of the reviews are most likely fake both the positive and negative ones.  There is no fact checking on these reviews or proof that the poster works at CIG they are anonymous and anyone can make one.  GlassDoor only works because  of the time no one has a reason to pretend they worked for a company.  In the case of a high profile company like RSI the system does nothing to prevent BS fake entries.,Star_citizen,d2z8bs1,3,t5_2vl2m

7855425,0,t1_d3v7qyh,Im sorry but doesnt it take like  years to make a game normally? And what year are we on?  is supposed to come out close to the end of the year which will probably be the beginning of next year. They have a lot done if  is this close to release its just they are keeping it such a secret that they cant share anything with us about what theyre doing. ,Star_citizen,d3z0rb5,1,t5_2vl2m
7924066,0,t3_4nqrnp,Very well put! I would like to add that we also get so much more than just a game that we are paying for. To an extent we actually have creative input into the game itself.Also think of how many hours of entertainment have we gotten in the form of ATV Wingmans Hanger RTV ect. Gratned we dont have to pay anything for these videos but that is thetype of stuff we are supporting and just that its there is enough for me.Its not like we are shoving money into some void and get nothing until release date. I dont know about you all but esspecially with . i have gotten more joy and entertainment from AC and the Mini PU than I have gotten from full games that I paid full retail price for. Plus this is just a sliver of what is to come! Even in its infant state I stumble across things that amaze me! Ever do one of the fetch missions and you realize Crap theres a derelict ship close to my beacon!. Then Eva over and find a crate filled with UECs or frozen Benny boxes or a gun!Every major update this game shows more and more that is is indeed the game that we all want and if I have extra money to blow on something that brings me hours and hours of enjoyment a safe bet for me is to place it on SC!,Star_citizen,d46qnl6,2,t5_2vl2m

8332817,0,t1_d5ini8y,UPDATE Wednesday For those of you that may have noticed thedrizztman one of the three gamers that really needs help keeps trying to post replies to me as if I care to read whatever the hell theyve wasted their time writing.Ive no idea what theyre saying. I dont waste my time reading it. Which if they werent brain damaged and could remember what I told them in previous replies that theyve proven not worth my time and absolutely not worth my talking to. As I noted to the mods if I respond to this person at all or those of their ilk its only to let the rest of you know Im still active in a thread. Its not for any benefit to this other person. I wont talk with them. I dont read their posts. Itll be even more hilarious if thedrizztman tries to use the term I came up with against me. Which could only possibly apply if I tried to talkpost to them. Which I wouldnt do anyways. Just like now Im talking to the rest of you not thedrizztman.Now that the rest of you know this feel free to watch as thedrizztman starts to freak out. Either here or in another thread that I post in lol. ,Star_citizen,d5j5oim,1,t5_2vl2m

9114762,0,t3_54xvzp,It does.  Thats why people arent quite holding their breath. It has a long way to go but so far it looks amazing.  This is the true space sim we deserve.  Were just gonna have to wait and see.   Fingers crossed.  ,Star_citizen,d87g3w3,1,t5_2vl2m
9258323,0,t1_d8ohqid,Not when considering the scope of what is trying to be done here. Look at FFXV this game has been  years in the making and it just appears to be a very in depth rpg. A halo fps game took   years for just the fps part. Flight sims take  years for development for them. A WOW MMO expansion takes  years for a decent size of content. This game is combining all three which no current engine out there could run so they now have to modify an gaming engine to even build they game they want. When you look at this yeah its gonna take some time. If I just gave money and saw nothing yes I would be concerned. But there are WEEKLY updates to projects that they are working on so you see the development as it goes and they share the problems and hurdles they encounter as they go. We are not being kept in the dark. I would rather wait longer for the game I want then have a game that is mediocre at best now.,Star_citizen,d8pk561,1,t5_2vl2m
