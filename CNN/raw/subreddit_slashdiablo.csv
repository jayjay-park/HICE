I cant see a downside.Option  is something Id never personally use and which I basically just see as a way to play at a slightly faster pace in cluttered drop places like cows or in front of Baal in the throne. My favorite part of Diablo is probably scanning the drops though so a feature like this wouldnt do anything for me.Option  seems like the most work for the least reward. Once youve played a bit you tend to know the ranges and you only really care on particular items. Because only particular stats on particular items are important it seems easy to remember them or to look up these particular things when its relevant. ,slashdiablo,cilbm6d,2,t5_2sv1q

That leaves giving it away which is fine but didnt help me buy anything.  And I know a lot of people will give me some stuff for free  but not every item.  And I like the feeling of finding a good item to trade for something I want.

Windows  diablo  works perfectly for me now.As for doing things one at a time again. I Need to Install do patcher and gateway editor before I change anything. Those need to be done every time. So no variability there. From there I can Put in new dgfx.dll put in w which I think I need to do anyways. so it might not be worth having that as a variable Different combination of compatibilitiesSo what do you suggest me do differently? try doing it without dgfx as first putting in w next then doing  compatibility? ,slashdiablo,cmmim9s,1,t5_2sv1q
2522623,0,t1_cmnrkl6,The most important part of all this is how you can open the ancient tunnels AND ENTER with telekinesis. Perhaps it save no time and actually wastes some yet you will surprise people with the knowledge and the actual uselessness of the information itself which is interesting to say the least.And you can also of course pick up potions without having to teleport next to them and it is SUPER useful to steal all the purple pots in a baal wave. Telekinesis is hardly the least useful skill since it saves quite a bit of time in Ancient tunnel runs and enables you to put stuff into your STASH without standing next to the frigging stash! Which saves even more time for those of us who are trying to be as productive as possible.  My nomination for the worst skill is probably fend since it is bugged in some awful way which makes it extremly bad. Cant remember the bug just the awfulness of it. ,slashdiablo,cmnuenh,2,t5_2sv1q

Take one look at torches that have been sold in the past week and you can get a general idea of what a keyset is worth. If even the most random torches are being sold for around IstGul then thats what you should use as your basis for pricing your full keysets.

2876691,0,t1_cnv1zi2,I hate to give such a vague answer bit honestly it depends. Are you facing monsters with minimal poison resist or are you fighting ones with higher resbreaking immunities with lower res a lot? e.g. in river of flame there are lots of poison immunes and I believe the venom lords in chaos have exactly  if youre facing higher resists keeping both on will help because lower resist will not be enoughAdditionally are you trying to kill without using lower resist? If so Id keep tritrang on then as well If you are using lower resist then youre at about  enemy pres once you combine LR and DW. This means if youre fighting against certain enemies with lower pres you may already be bringing them to the resistance floor of . At that point the benefit of tritrangs enemy res starts to diminishAlso remember that since poison is damage over time and doesnt stack fcr isnt that huge deal at least imo. It will only really help your teleporting speedIf you do still want to teleport faster a fcr circlet rings andor amulet can also be of assistanceEdit if youre just continuing easy areas like pit runs and want to do them faster then Yea swapping for spiritarachs makes a lot of sense,slashdiablo,cnv2xii,1,t5_2sv1q

Your input has been very valuable and I rather enjoy options. Cookiecutter builds are nice to an extent but it is more satisfying to rock n roll with your own personalized build. I hadnt fully considered the option of using chancies. For the sake of going balls out I think at least for now that going the arach and chancie route will be coolio. The mana perks from mages would be nice but I am ultimately trying to find some items rather than runes or bases. The fcr ammy is kind of limiting though as it generally requires crafting and a solid crafting ammy requires clvl  which I am currently not at.

4315343,0,t1_csbz6e9,Considering most mobs get annihilated by staticnovapulses and I teleport often I would say its a great deal faster than bearform and enough faster than passion. Enchant is what deals the most vs lightning immunes and obviously I have a merc whos chanted as well. CtA pb on switch with phoenix cleans up nicely.Generally with a melee sorc you dont want to go headlong into a pack of mobs because they will kill you this means you kill one and take a few steps to engage the next. In a pattern like this zeal loses out to regular attack all day where your best speed vs single mobs would be frame animation vs a frame animation from normal attack but really for my normal setup its  frame but whos counting thats still a lot less than . I like playing this strategy better than relying on glacial to save me which again takes some frames to castIm sure the zeal setup works better vs baal but Id rather have the elr vs any of the rest of them.,slashdiablo,csc2ect,2,t5_2sv1q

5105207,0,t1_cv0ole8,Building a crusher is worth it IMO if you expect to be rushing a lot of characters mules and get some runes in the process. It is not even hard to find decent gear in classic.  The hellforge quest alone is not a real thing as mentioned you can get at best a gul. However getting your next build to hell chaos before level  can be a cool thing ...   Perhaps the only possible downside of doing that at a fresh restart is that its going to slow one down a bit for some of the first items cheap runewords rares etc and xp. Some rares like magefist are even easier to find there so it might end up in ones advantage.

5834056,0,t1_cxkcles,If you get a decent p baal group going youd start with some agreement on handling drops. A tele sorc a BO barb and any muscle character can clear the throne and handle the first  waves with no help. In the meantime other characters can get LK chests a key boss or meph before joining up for the good waves. A geared hdin can potentially get BO quick kill chaos by himself and get to the throne before wave  is over. Top  kill baal including a high MF character bugged for quest drops. This is all significantly faster than a p multibox run and may actually be better drops per person per time if everyone knows how to act like an adult.I guess my greater point is that this should be a thread about getting people to run a group like this instead of a thread about multiboxing. For now youd get x the exp on your account per run if you have your other characters parked in the corner for the waves.,slashdiablo,cxkde2s,3,t5_2sv1q

5887898,0,t3_3vwluj,On jsp its a little more valuable merely the fact that gold has more value. Not saying people dont buy gold here its just not as often. Other then that all your gf merits depends on you and what you want to find. A gf barb may or may not have some mf stacked along with him. Mfing and gfing trav you can find some nice jewels or jewelry sometimes. Occasionally a high rune may drop too. On the gambling piece youll mostly be spending your money either on jewelry specifically amulets at level  or you will be spending it on coronets and sometimes circlets. Buying only coronets can be time consuming sometimes because coronets dont always show up at the gambling screen so youll have to exit and open a new gambling screen. Time wise I believe a gf barb can be efficient with the right set up for timesrun considering the potential from trav and gambling. However it is rather repetitive and itll be good to take a break once in a while to do something else. ,slashdiablo,cxrfr01,2,t5_2sv1q

The  CB base flail speed and additional  IAS is insanely good for the price.Jam an IAS Jewel Act  Larzuk Quest in your GFace. Theyre cheap ppl sometimes use them as junk for crafting and a merc can happily wear it later.Try to get a low Dracs. They are cheap sometimes even free. Dracs are what you want if you have the IAS you need. If not Laying of Hands is good and cheapfree. It has lots of IAS loooads of Fire res and Demon damage not sure how it translates to actual Smite damage but stillnice mods if you need resIAS.Make yourself a Stone os Elite or a decent Treachery. Edit Duress is also worth looking at CBresDefensecheap. Stone makes you super tanky postHoly Shield while Treachery is cheaper and provides a big IAS boost and also Fade. Stone rounds out your defenses amid the crazy IASleech. Treachery is living on the edge with the Fade security blanket.Id swap out Seraphs for something with more IAS if youre struggling to hit  frames. Highlords is good for the light resIAS Cats Eye can do the job too if you dont need the res. Cats Eye also helps if you want to use a PB.Nosferatus belt is a nice budget belt for a Smiter if you need the ias. String of Ears works for a budget belt but your Dungos are fine.Rings are up to you but I like an RFrost to avoid being chilled.Hang on to any decenthigh res charms you have and just stack em and with good iaslifetap the  Anyas an Anni and your Hoz you should be able to squeak by.,slashdiablo,d1hacm5,2,t5_2sv1q

I definitely noticed a huge difference with cows this season and didnt know why  with bonewall I herd the cows into big groups of maybe  or  huge groups per level and kill them all at once. This is about  of the level including an elite group  i spent about  mins on reddit and most of the corpses went away but you get the picture Last ladder with killing a gorup of cows I had to pick up junk because so much shit was dropping I couldnt see it all and now only about  white items including pots in that number will drop for me. not that it is game ruining  just seems like I should be running bosses instead of cows now.

8599679,0,t3_4xlzkr,Singleplayer and multiplayer are mostly the same. The main difference is your running around with another human player so you guys can work together. Monster drops exp and life all increase every time a player joins your game so its both more challenging and rewarding than solo.The ladder just shows the highest levels exp on the realm. You dont win anything. Its mostly for fun though some players take it seriously because they want to racechallenge themselves.I dont think you need to do the campaign first. I think its more fun to play with friends. The only warning id give you is that some players will be kind and try to give you gear. Obviously if you accept the gear the game will be easier. So if your doing this for the challenge maybe playing solo once is better.Slash diablo has a discord. Im sure you can hop on and ask around for other new players.,slashdiablo,d6gjwps,4,t5_2sv1q

8740493,0,t1_d6xtkz3,Im on both sides of the fence regarding this. I dont know if you remember or not but back when dolastef were botting scclassic maybe they still are idk there was a ladder tracking website that showed exp gainedlost dailyweekly and  of level and what not. Basically a whole bunch of stats regarding that individuals characters. However the info was really really wrong most of the time. It was really neat seeing how badly Dola was raping us and how badly we were raping everyone else. I feel like constantly sending information might be too troublesome for a server that until a couple seasons ago was unbearably slow because they forgot to run windows update. On top of that a forever ladder removes the purpose of a ladder. Furthermore this community is so closeknit that characters live on past the person. Does everyone know theres a  attached to my name? No but that doesnt matter to me. The people that baaled with me for hours remember. Just like I remember Hero MDB Kev and everyone else that helped me. You shouldnt be playing slash or any game for immortality its about the personal friendships you make. If theyre just in it for their foreverspot on ladder I feel like this would create dangerous levels of competition read botting especially if its drawing a huge influx of players like you suspect. Okay maybe I dont have anything that positive to say about your suggestion. But a more complex statsladder like I described but actually accurate  that is seasonal would be something Id be interested in even though Im moreless retired. ,slashdiablo,d6y7o0g,-1,t5_2sv1q

It was when public dupe methods were released and angry dupers decided to keep crashing the Bnet servers with the token exploit.  I then saw a guy on jsp talk about Slash and gave it a try. I immediately loved this place and never looked back.  I try to give back as much as I can to the community by helping people and try to maintain the good spirit and positivity that make Slash great.  I usually dont have goals for a ladder. I just play regardless of the moment in the ladder cycle. I guess my goal is to have fun and live outstanding experiences.  Perhaps I could say I wish to enhance PvP activity but in all honesty it is not something easy nor something I can claim to accomplish alone.

9416821,0,t3_59le0m,Nice review. I think Its great for someone who hasnt gotten through a whole ladder yet picking the things that immediately popped up for you. Ive been at slash for like ish years now though not straight. When I first started alot of the things you brought up were exactly what caught my attention at first too. First and foremost the community. When I started It felt like the whole community was there to solely help me. I had no trouble whatsoever getting into hell getting decently geared so that I could start mfing myself. One user even let me borrow an enigma let me use it and said hed ask for it back when he made whatever char but just never bothered to ask for it back.Between the community and no obvious way to take advantage of the game or market on the server I just felt completely at home here. I dont think Ill ever go back to bnet. And I doubt Ill ever leave slash for another server unless some serious core values here change. Im looking forward to your next vidoes about the server.,slashdiablo,d99nbki,4,t5_2sv1q

Afterward you will prob want to switch to the purely physical damage dragon talon? Im not sure if talon is better by itself or with tiger strike never made it that far. Death sentry is always good for CE and youll need lots of CB and good boots upgraded gores are best. The problem with this build in HC is that at least wo BO if you want to get max block you will have a very low life pool and if you dont care about block you will have a mediocre life pool and no blocking. You could use  claws and get weapon block skill but it caps out at like  and claws are far from ideal weapons for a kicksin.

I took a  ish year hiatus and learned it had dropped aftwr being berated by a few players for expecting that extra half ohm for awhile.Because of my anecdotal experience I dont see why its crazy to think Lo could be valued at  now. And in turn ber . Edit honestly i have a ber but havr no use for it but with this ladders current economy i dont think ill bother breaking it unless its  on the dot or more.

11771779,0,t3_67z54b,Go to ItemDisplay.cfg  Around the very top you should see  gt ItemDisplayGEMLEVEL  ItemDisplayGEMLEVEL  ItemDisplayGEMLEVEL  ItemDisplayGEMLEVEL   Change those lines to  gt ItemDisplayGEMLEVEL  ItemDisplayGEMLEVEL   ItemDisplayGEMLEVEL   ItemDisplayGEMLEVEL   This will show all gems again.  To hide chipped gems remove the  before the GEMLEVEL line and so on and so forth.  You dont see a line for GEMLEVEL perfect because it assumes you always want to see those gems.Basically what this line of code is doinggt ItemDisplayGEMLEVEL   is hiding any chipped gems level from showing because there is nothing after the .  You can either delete the line entirely or do like I said before and add the s in front to just skip the lines.  I like doing it this way so that if you ever wanted to hide certain gem types again you can just remove the s instead of having to think about what the code is to add them back.,slashdiablo,dgud2ma,2,t5_2sv1q
