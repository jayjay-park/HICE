It seems a meagre and unofficial and even dangerous thing from which to craft an entire alternative to a global system but so did money and credit in the age of Edward III.All of this free time and free stuff has depended upon high EROEI of fossil fuels. Since theyre overheating the planet and will need to be replaced with green energy this utopian economy sounds like hand waving to me.,NoCorporations,ctbpese,2,t5_359v8

Theres no real danger to other countries from the Fukushima and has certainly not contaminated the entire Pacific Ocean not in the since the article is trying to put forward.If were gonna talk about the shitty things megacorps do lets stick to the facts.
