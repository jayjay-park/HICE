9403632,0,t1_d97y2sh,I agree with everything you said right up to S because I havent got that far yet  which makes me think that maybe I wont like it as much eitherI did in all honesty feel sorry for Sister Jude in later episodes but I personally didnt like the way this person was the villain then this person was the villain though nice twist on that one then later on this person is now the villain and Im feeling sorry for the original villain maybe that would work over a number of seasons with a consistent story but I didnt like all this in one season.Other than that Im not sure what I disliked about it I usually love asylumthemed horror and think they have so much potential but felt let down by this from the onset.I think with S its more to do with the fact it references reallife events Salam Witches and Ive always been fascinated by this kind of stuff plus I think the overall story is great too Im up to where the witch wants to join the voodoo clan and currently hate her and feel sorry for Madam Whathername.I agree theres no right or wrong way to do things but what I want to know is what is it about these truly great stories that make them so popular so fast Twilight  Shades Vampire Diaries Breaking Bad Sons Of Anarchy American Horror Story  Whats this secret formula these people seem to use that were oblivious to?I dont mind a heavy sexual element if its done tastefully but I also love characters Such as Jesse Pinkman  Breaking Bad who go through a lot of character development however if I dont find that a plot can hold my attention I lose interest in the story itself too.In terms of horror I think dolls and children are overdone However I highly recommend reading Betsy The Doll that was mindblowing and clowns it depends really like stuff like IT yeah it was a classic back in its day but these kinds of clowns in stories and films right now are irritating however stories that tie in with the recent realworld clown epidemic can be clever.I personally love psychological horror and stuff that makes you think I love anything realistic such as the popular Experiment creepypastas and anything thats told skillfully in firstperson despite being about a demon or the boogeyman or a monster in the closet I find that firstperson element really adds something.I also love stories where kids are the victims I dont mean get beat or abused like in  and PENPAL I though those two stories were absolute genius but stories where the kids themselves are possessed or something of the like are a bit boring and overdone.,WriteWorld,d97z6nq,1,t5_3d4c7
