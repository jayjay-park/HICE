231168,0,t1_cf3xrtd,honestly not really.  Im not much of a lyricist myself.  That said I have a few other songs  some full some incomplete  that I will probably be posting up here in the near future.  They do not have vocals either but Im messing with the idea of tying them all together with a common storyline.  Im a big coheed and cambria fan and I love how all of their songsalbums are part of the same story arch.  One idea that has somewhat taken shape in my head is about two brothers set in the s think Hell on Wheels who go in search of something valuable but end up turning on each other.  This song may be near the beginning when they are leaving hence the send off.  If youre not shaking your head yet I can try to flesh it out a little more and send a writeup.  tldr suck at writing lyrics have a bare bones story idea but if thats too lame any vocals at all on this track would make me happy!   ,MusicInTheMaking,cf4pis1,3,t5_2s9z8
