1764837,0,t1_ck0ghr1,I dont wish to go super fast Im not that kinda kid. I usually ride comfortably  mph above the speed limit and thats about it.Would finding a junkyard version of this car and taking panels work for replacing panels?Also how much does replacing a coil cost? Im just curious as I want more reasons to maybe haggle down the price a bit.,MazdaProtege,ck1m46q,1,t5_2uqsj

5652622,0,t1_cwxqv63,Damn that sucks I hate that rule with apartment complexes. I love going out side and tinkering with the car whenever I can and it has saved me tons of money too! But if you ever get in the situation where you are able to work on it YouTube and forums are where to start. Along with just experimenting in your own way. I know a whole lot about cars now just from doing some research messing around with a component then seeing the results. Thats awesome with the macbook panda! I sorta understand electronics and can build a pc but fixing a broken phone? Ha no way in hell I could do that my hands would be too shaky to get at the tiny screws and such Battery cables could definitely cause that as well. Try doing some resistance tests with the grounds AC compressor and alternator. ,MazdaProtege,cwxrh9q,1,t5_2uqsj
10027131,0,t1_d8renya,I also had a leak in my clutch soft line. This is a cheap fix and worth looking at before you go spending too much time or money. Of course a bleed wouldnt hurt and is another thing to check for cheap. ,MazdaProtege,dbek9p2,1,t5_2uqsj
