5844271,0,t3_3v2cj8,Weve just started using IT Glue and it is phenomenal for our uses. Some days I actually enjoy inputting data imagine that. It just makes it so easy.  recommendation here. The bad side is that their plans start at m m but I guess you get what you pay for. MaxFocus integration comes in January and it already has way AutoTask sync.I should add that this is the most complete documentationversion controlpassword locker out there and is totally tailored towards MSPs. We tried the others but we were blown away. We are on the long road of perfecting our documentation and IT Glue is making that process a thousand times easier. Im not a shill and nor am I paid by them but just a thoroughly impressed user.Give their  day trial a whirl and youll be missing it when the trial ends.,MaxFocus,cxlpl57,1,t5_37rfl

9099280,0,t3_53t6dn,Bitdefender has been a colossal pain in the ass since we moved over from Vipre. I constantly get alerts for systems not being updated many of which are laptops that are powered off. and I get a ton of systems that have the Endpoint Master service not being started. Quite simply its a mess. Ive opened tickets with Maxfocus on this who tell me Were working on it. This has been going on for MONTHS! Ive spent a fair amount of time going through their steps which is a complete waste of my time. isnt the point of Maxfocus to SAVE time?. Im getting close to my wits end with this.....,MaxFocus,d85l4dr,1,t5_37rfl

10976330,0,t1_debv5dw,I was hoping to be able to use the Dashboard since the view and details look much better IMO. Ill play around with Wallchart some more but it doesnt seem very customizable unfortunately.,MaxFocus,dec5oi4,1,t5_37rfl
