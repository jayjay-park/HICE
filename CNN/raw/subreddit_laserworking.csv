10874389,0,t1_ddw54g7,Hi Silicone can be cut on a laser  Ive been able to do it on me Full Spectrum th Gen w. I also have the rotary attachment and that lets you do rounded surfaces  although its a ball and technically the rotary attachment cant adjust for a sphere usually the curve or distance isnt enough to make the laser completely out of focus so you can get away with it. Its actually a benefit that it will be a small ball. Only problem is that a FSL th Gen will set you back .k. I cant comment on the cheapy chinese ebay machines.,laserworking,de1m6j9,1,t5_39hz7
