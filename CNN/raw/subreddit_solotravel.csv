247501,0,t3_1wwrcc, months is probably longer than youll need to be in Thailand. I spent  month there and did everything you are talking about doing and more. I wouldnt spend less but I definitely wouldnt spend more. Both Cambodia and Laos are wonderful but if I had to give my recommendation it would be to spend some time in Vietnam. The beauty of that country is hard to exaggerate and there is so much fascinating history there. The same is true of both Cambodia and Laos but I found Vietnam to be more interesting and rewarding. If you do want to choose between Cambodia and Laos Id recommend Cambodia. Angkor is simply a mustsee. Laos is wonderful but it is very undeveloped. I found Cambodia to be a more interesting traveling experience. Honestly though with  months you could probably do Thailand for a month  week in Cambodia if you only see Angkor and then move on its not the end of the world and then three weeks in Vietnam. That would be my recommendation. ,solotravel,cf6enhm,6,t5_2rxxm

Traffic especially in the north of the country can be hideous and road conditions just as bad. Id at least consider having a few bike lessons back home before you come out and if possible try a little offroad riding. Its not impossible though i met others whod landed in Vietnam having never ridden a bike and managed to muddle through but take care many others end up in hospital and if you dont have a proper bike licence your travel insurance wont cover you.,solotravel,cfxge0s,3,t5_2rxxm

I exclusively took chicken buses and it was fine and a lot cheaper. Youll have a blast. Here were some of my favorites. Guatemala Tikal Ruins. Its worth buying a tour and doing the  am one tons of animals out there! San Juan Travel was cheapest. Semuc Champey was awesome. Stay at El Retiro in Lanquin and shell out for the communal dinners delicious and a great way to make friends. Do the candlelit cave tour. Antigua I really liked the Pasar de los Anos hostel. San Francisco Cathedral had awesome ruins.  El Salvador I was a girl travelling alone so my experience will be different but I felt SUPER unsafe while in El Salvador. If youre set on going stick to the Ruta de las Flores. Juayua had a beautiful hike out to a waterfall. If you do this or any other hikes take a police escort. Its free and theyre more than happy to do it. Also no hostels in El Salvador exclusively hotels. I didnt go to the coast here might be different. And because I felt to uncomfortable in El Salvador I changed my plans and skipped Honduras altogether. Nicaragua my favorite!! If you like hiking head up to the North. Otherwise you MUST go to Leon and stay at Bigfoot and go volcano boarding! In Granada Panda Hostel has  accommodation. Explore the old hospital ruins. Isla de Ometepe is fantastic. Theres no party scene but stay at Finca Magdalena at the base of the volcano for a really relaxing experience. If you dive go to Corn Island. Costa Rica Go to La Fortuna and hike Cerro Chatto for sick views of Arenal. Dont get conned into going to BaldiTabacon hot springs. Get some friends and pay a cab  to take you to the free hot springs in the middle of the jungle. If you want to zipline do it in Monteverde and stay at Sloth Backpackers. For a party go to Tamarindo Pacific Coast and Puerto Viejo Carribean Coast. Stay at Rocking Js and rent a hammock for night and a crazy hostel experience. Hope that helps!

Prague has a lot of sights to see aside from the castle hill and you can take the bus train to nearby smaller towns for day or halfday trips. There is this nearby small town that has an ossuary and its pretty interesting. Food in Prague is good and pretty cheap. The city gets really hot in the summer because its all stone but its really beautiful and walkable.  They also have the largest dance hall in central Europe if thats your thing.Vienna is a bit pricier than Prague but cleaner at least the places where Ive gone to within the Ring. Schonbrunn Palace is a mustsee. Trains are kind of pricey but the stations are clean. Most of the important buildings are within the Ring like the town hall Volksgarden Vienna Cathedral Spanish riding school and a couple of Hofsburg palaces so you can definitely save time.

1031649,0,t3_25wrj8,I wasnt alone but even with a friend there were a couple of times we felt unsafe in Spain.  Did not really fear physical violence but the pick pockets were pretty bad.  In our hotel in Madrid there was a police officer stationed out front with a large gun.  There was an outer dining area near the street but still inside and an inner dining area. The guests were encouraged to eat in the dining area further inside the hotel because they said pick pockets would come in off the street while guests got up and would take their belongings.  We were almost victims of thievery twice while we were there.  The first time was near a tourist attraction and we had our packs on.  An elderly lady came up to us with a map as if to ask us directions.  We began looking at the map with her and sat our packs on the ground.  She put the map on top of our packs and then was trying to go under it to take items out using the map as a shield for what she was doing.  If I had been alone I probably wouldnt have noticed what she was doing but my friend was standing back and saw her.  The second time we are pretty sure we were targeted because we were speaking English on the train.  Two guys followed us off the train and ran up behind us trying to take my pack and keep running.  Again my friend noticed them running up and yelled at me to move my pack to the front right as they reached for it.  For what its worth these things happened in the urban areas.  When we were in smaller towns like Toledo we felt totally safe.,solotravel,chljxu4,8,t5_2rxxm

Not yet.Not posting any pictures is considerably more selfish youre not sharing any of your travels and perhaps then any of your mindset but for me this is what Id want. It means that youre being honest with the selfish intent of your travel and youre willing to let go all of the holds upon you. There is something about travel when the camera leaves your reach when time is unreal and you do have to face what is really inside you. No one can reach this spot except you even if you bother to post pictures of magnificent breakfasts and little seabeast kids online. A postcard can be just as meaningless I can see this but honestly who feels special when they see posted pictures of a friends travels over receiving a card from a roadweary sojourner?

1184665,0,t3_27oggg,I live in Japan so hopefully I can help you out a bit.Hostels will run you around   yen a night.  The higher price will get you a private room though if youre looking to save money Id go for a dormstyle one.  Japan is a very safe country for travellers so you dont have to worry too much about your stuff getting stolen.  Take a look on hostelworld.com for some good places.  I recommend JHoppers or Ks House  Ive stayed in a loooot of hostels in Japan and have only ever been to one or two duds.  For the most part theyre quite nice. will be more than enough.  Yes things in Japan can be expensive but as long as youre not buying your weight in souvenirs you should be fine.  If youre staying within Tokyo a days train fare to  or  different stations should only be around  and Tokyos a very walkable city if you have a map.Ive never been to Tokyo alone so Im not sure if itd be a fun place to go alone.  There isnt a whole lot of old traditional stuff in the downtown area theres a lot of shopping cool modern architecture and great nightlife so it might be worth making friends with the people you meet in the hostel and try to go out with them.  Mustdos in Tokyo would be the Shibuya Scramble intersection Sunday afternoon in Yoyogi Park to see the Harajuku fashion Tokyo Sky Tree or Tokyo Tower though if you want to get a great view of Tokyo for free and with fewer people go up Tokyo City Hall at nighttime and Rainbow Bridge.  Surprisingly Id say that Tokyo has fewer interesting things to do than Kyoto does.If youre coming in the winter be sure to bring warm clothes.  It definitely does snow quite a bit in Japan and it tends to be the wet slushy kind so bring waterproof boots socks a decent jacket mitts etc.  You dont need a parka or anything like that but enough to keep you decently warm.  Itll get down to around  celsius most likely.I dont know very much about getting SIM cards here but Ive heard it can be kind of hard.  Which sucks a lot cause wifi is pretty hard to find here.Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions!,solotravel,ci2w6ol,3,t5_2rxxm

Im leaving for London and Paris tomorrow for my first solo trip and I picked those two places because Ive always wanted to go there and I could get to and from both for an okay price. It took me a while to narrow down where I wanted to go but you need to look at how long youll be going only a week you might just want to go to one or two places and whats reasonable.My favorite suggestion to give is to go on skyscanner.com and put in where youll fly out of and leave the where youre flying to blank.

I stayed at Taipei Triple Tiger hostel. Very nice and located close to the train. Easy enough to find.I basically walked around and checked out the top tourist attractions. Since I had a SIM card I had access to Google Maps so I would often just walk down streets that looked interesting.Checked out Taipei  but it was super cloudy. Met up with someone from CouchSurfing. Checked out a food market. Ate stinky tofu. AWFUL! Hopped A Train To HualienThe trains are a bit confusing but Taiwanese people are very friendly! The confused white guy with a backpack look helped a lot. Google Maps helped me tell when I was getting close to Hualien as I couldnt understand signs or the train announcer.CouchSurfed with a college student. Did lots of walking around. Walked to the ocean. Philippines SeaHopped A Train To YuliYuli is a town of around  I think ... I had no place to stay but was able to get a room in the hotel across from the train station .. even though no one spoke English.Yuli was a high point for me as I was the only white person I saw for  days .. until I saw a Mormon missionary. Based on Wikitravel I sought out Our House Cafe because it said they have a wide selection of Belgium beer! I sat and chilled with the owner for several hours! Super nice guy!I rented a motorcycle from a guy who didnt speak English and toured around the countryside and national park!Train To TaitungI stayed in the Taitung Sea Art Hostel and was their only guest.Super chill couple Canadian guy and his Taiwanese wife run the place and I pretty much relaxed for a few days. Took walks with their dogs. Read a bunch. Just did not much of anything.Train To KaohsiungStayed in a hotel. Met up with people from CouchSurfing. Ate great food. Drank beer.

Auschwitz is a must and I found the salt mines worthwhile too.For Brno I didnt get to cesky krumlov unfortunately I would highly recommend going up to the lake region! One or two lines of the trams sorry I cant remember which runs right to the lake. At the tram stop when you get off take the road on the side where the tram lets you off. No need to cross over to the stores. I was lucky and there was some sort of festival going on that lined the road down to the lakefront but even without youll still get there  it isnt far. The lake area was super pretty and I took the ferry all the way to the Veveri about min away and one of the last stops. Reasonably priced and the view was lovely! Alternatively you can get off earlier and go to the beach or hike but I loved the castle and really recommend it. Its not pristine and I loved that. You could walk on some of the walls go up narrow staircases crawl through the rafters...yes seriously! I was there at pm on a Sunday so one wing was closed inside which I assume is an actual exhibit or something. Who knows haha. The whole area is great to walk around if you have time you could definitely spend a whole sunny day at the Brno Dam Lake. As for hostels...I will personally recommend against Ruta  as I did not have a very good experience there. There are other hostels inside the city centre which are a bit more expensive but probably better based on how mine was. For Prague definitely go to Petrin! The hike up is uh a bit gruelling when its C so the tram thing is probably a good idea haha. I didnt realise it was the same ticket as regular tramsbusesmetro and decided to be adventurous. It was fun but in the heat...so much sweat! Also keep going towards the monastery. Great breweries and food there. And a spectacular view of the city.Sorry this is a bit of a novel!

Use the Rail Planner that interraileurail make and check how many trains do your route a day. Lots of the popular routes will have a train every hour or two so I would just turn up at the station when I was ready and book the next one. If you dont have many options just go whenever you know when youre leaving but be warned that some big stations will have massive queues at the ticket desk so leave yourself at least an hour to queue before you need to get your train.

1919853,0,t1_ckkevlc,HeyYes for Canadians most countries give you a  day visit visa on arrival Malaysia give you !!. That means you dont need to apply for it before hand. Please make sure which countries if the countries you wish to visit offer on arrival visas for Canadians since they might be changing .Check this wiki very helpfulSome of the countries offer free visas some at a cost so also check that out.Some countries require proof of onward travel that means you cant go in with a one way ticket since they want proof that you will be leaving their country. An example of that is Philippines I had a one way ticket from Abu Dhabi. In Abu Dhabi they did not let me board the plane unless I had a ticket out of Philippines which I did and had booked the night before it was cheap air asia flight to Malaysia. Worst case you could just buy a ticket at the airport...Sometimes they never ask for proof of onward travel sometimes they do I didnt want to take the risk so I just booked a cheapest flight out of the Philippines at the time. That way if I dont make it I wont feel guilty if I ditch the flight. That worked for me since I met people who wanted to go to Malaysia and just joined me other wise it was a  i was willing to loose.Hope this helps...let me know if you have any other questions!,solotravel,ckkj274,2,t5_2rxxm

The Vasa museum is quite a popular place a royal ship that sank and was restored a few years ago and last year ABBA museum together with the rest of swedish pop music was opened and is quite fun both major turist attractions. The TV tower is an option if theres good weather but I havent been up there myselfHaving been in Stockholm many times I like to be outdoors more and have visited places which are not that touristy. A great museum with indoor and outdoor sculptures is Millesgrden even though Im not a huge fan of sculptures the place was just fantastic even in mid winter and not so great weather The sculptures are of a famous swedish sculptor painter etc Carl Milles.And my favorite is the Haga park. The summerhouse of the royal family is there the whole park is a worthy place for a nice calm stroll where you can enjoy exploring different structures. The place to visit there is the Butterfly house which might sound childish but is actually a really cool place with large butterflies flying freely and there are also other animals like fish and birds... Last year they also had shark there I suppose they still do.Ive been to Helsinki too but Ive forgotten a lot of it.,solotravel,cmbu4dt,3,t5_2rxxm

2483499,0,t3_2o0lh4, Firstly New Orleans  LA is  hours not  hours and SD to SF is more like  hours than  on all the schedules I can see? Secondly are you sure each of these trips is one segment? The rules for the rail pass say gtAmtrak considers a travel segment any time you get on and then get off a vehicle train bus ferry or other allowable leg regardless of length.I dont think for instance that there is a direct train from San Diego  San Francisco it looks to me like this is at least two segments assuming you would get off in Oakland and transfer yourself downtown. But you can get a return bus from LA  SD for about  gotobus.com so perhaps it would be worth doing that which would give you one spare segment  or just cut San Diego. This even means you have an extra segment I think  so you could stop somewhere between New Orleans and LA. Stop in San Antonio and get a bus to Austin for  each way if you book far enough ahead then you can leave that off the second part of your trip. Thirdly April shouldnt be too bad but running on a very tight schedule like you are you should probably reserve all your trains as soon as you buy the pass. It would screw you up pretty badly to not get a seat on the New Orleans  LA leg and have to wait two days for the next one.Whether its long enough or not is up to you. If youre really trying to decide where you want to move then you should probably focus on that and not sightseeing after all if you decide to move to Sacramento then you will have plenty of opportunity to visit SF in the future! To see if it feels like long enough try doing a proper calendar egWednesday April   depart Chicago  day timer starts. pm arrive Pittsburgh    Saturday th dep Pittsburgh .am arr Philly pm.      Tuesday th dep Philly pm     Wed th arr NOLA pm     Sat th dep NOLA am     Monday th arr LA ametc etcFor the second part of your trip you can fly ChicagoDenver return for  if you get a sale fare would save you a lot of time and give you one extra train segment to play with. Then busing ChicagoNashvilleAshvilleChicago can be done for something like      according to romerio.com. And if your budget shows some spare you can fly AustinSan Diego for  and save a day and a half of travel time and fit in San Diego during your Amtrak time. ,solotravel,cmiqcl5,2,t5_2rxxm

2508183,0,t3_2oac1d,I spent  weeks in Chile this past summer. If youre starting out in Santiago I have to recommend Aji hostel. Breakfast AND dinner are included with the price! It became my home base as I travelled around Chile. If you are in Santiago and looking to get out of the city for a bit after seeing all the museums check out Villa Grimaldi. You can reach it by bus for a quick day trip. It is a villa turned torture camp turned memorialmuseum and is worth seeing if youve already gone to Museo de la memoria.San Pedro de Atacama to see the Atacama desert can get really expensive if you want to do any tours. You could rent bikes and explore Valle de la Luna without an expensive tour or walk to the ruins of Pukara de Quitor. Both charge a small admissions fee but its cheaper than the tour and you arent shepherded around the entire time by the tour guide! Its a  hour bus ride from santiago to San Pedro de Atacama but if youre heading up to Bolivia anyways I would do that and then look into a salt flats tour across the border. I ran into a few people who were doing that although I didnt get to do it myself. If you can fit Valparaiso in to your trip Id recommend checking that city out as well. I went for the weekend and ended up staying an extra week I loved it so much. So then again if youre trying to fit everything in maybe Valparaiso isnt the best place to go! ,solotravel,cmlyhe1,1,t5_2rxxm

2569469,0,t3_2p6rzb,I walked the Shikoku Henro in  sleeping rough for the authentic experience although I ate out of convenience stores. The whole process and ritual of it gave a lot of meaning to what otherwise was a long walk through Japanese suburbs and countryside. That was an experience in itself but it wouldnt have been half what it was otherwise. I was a big white guy in pilgrim garb and people could not have been more pleased and kind. It wasnt all good but it was entirely worth it.The real advice I have  which I think is pretty benign and youll hear from other people  is to get into the religious aspect as much as you can regardless of what you actually believe. I dont know if you are Catholic but if youre doing a Catholic pilgrimage be Catholic to the ultimate extent with which you are comfortable. And if you are Catholic I think do your best to forget what youve been told that means. Im not a Buddhist and it wasnt until I was halfway through my Buddhist pilgrimage that I realized I was doing it all wrong. Youre not on a long walk youre within a cultural and social entity that is bigger and older than you and everything youve come from. The people who live along the route have grown up with it theyve seen your kind their entire life and it was the same for their parents and their grandparents. Youve entered their meaning in a way that merely arriving and leaving a place can never otherwise be. Nor is it like living in a place where you must begin as an outsider and may never entirely stop being an outsider. If youre a pilgrim then you are a pilgrim. Inhabit the role. You dont need to lie but youll have to try. If you can get out of your head like that then the pilgrimage doesnt end when you stop walking. All the other travel in my life was just a notch on my belt in comparison with the pilgrimage. Everything else was like I went there I saw that I did that I had some interesting thoughts and brought back some nice things. But for five weeks I was a Henro. Does that make sense?,solotravel,cmtyuh8,9,t5_2rxxm

Youll probably break in NORCALSouth Oregon and from there its only another  hours to Blaine WA which is the borderId recommend once getting there Blaine that is to take the SR border crossing. Its much quicker. Then take Highway  which will turn into Oak Street until you hit Broadway then turn right and take a left on Cambie to get into the city Vancouver in the most spectacularly dramatic way possible.Ive done the opposite drive more than once.

Most cheap backpackers just stick together and their interactions are limited to other backpackers and locals in the tourist trade.  They dont actually get out there. Personally Im more of an introvert and its not my scene at least not dayin and dayout.  I generally travel by motorcycle and stay in budget hotels.  However I do try to stack the odds in my favor for serendipitous encounters.  I try to stop and sleep at places that seem to have some social relevance.

2939536,0,t1_co28h38,I spent somewhere in the range of K for  months in SE Asia.  I didnt really pay much attention to my budgeting since I started with a lot.  SE Asia is cheap.  I am currently spending far more in Australia.  Bootsnall.com has a planning course and they provide a spreadsheet in google docs to help calculate the cost.  Also IIRC their website has approximate daily costs for a lot of destinations.Visa wise the best approach is to handle it as you go.  Many times guesthouses or tour agencies can handle the visa for you for a small fee.  Otherwise you can go to the embassy and handle it yourself.  For Vietnam I had the guesthouse I was staying at get the visa for me.  It was as easy as handing it to them and getting it back  days later with the Visa.  For Myanmar I went directly to the embassy in Bangkok.  I filled out one piece of paper paid the money and had my visa in  days or so.

3140981,0,t1_conjomu,Its few that take the time to learn a language before going anywhere. Just look up some common courtesy words like Thanks Hello Yes No in the local language and you will be fine. Lots of the locals speaks English anyway although many times poorly enough to get by and the courtesy words helps you to adapt a bit. For those who dont more or less all travelers do youll get by on body language download a translating app to your phone as well as a last resort.   My suggestion would be to just travel to Singapore stay a couple of days and acclimatize to the weather and the time difference. Dont stay to long though just a couple of days as it is an expensive country. Then make your way up via Malaysia Thailand Laos Cambodia maybe add Myanmar and Vietnam to that. Either fly home from Vietnam or circle back down to Bangkok which probably is a cheaper option lots and lots of flights back to Europe from here. If the budget is excluding airfares Id say it will last like  months depending on your standards.  Dont over plan just go and have fun.

When I travel alone I just try to focus on traveling alone and if I happen to meet interesting people and I always do than let it happen. Try not to force it. Also Im not sure how old you are but perhaps if you are set on connecting with other travelers try to connect with older travelers. A lot of the fresh out of school kids are immature and just traveling around searching for the next hookup or party. You can also try to stay at guesthouse so instead of hostels if you can afford it. I find these tend to attract a more mature less partycentric crowd. And finally just enjoy your solo time! Bring a book to dinner or people watch.

This is not peak season so youll most likely be able to find lodging somewhere in the townGOOD ON YA for having a rental! theyre expensive as fuck but great for experiencing. If youre alone remember that you might find people to travel with at hostels and they share the gas cost Now about things to see Im just gonna CP a previous answer I madeNOW the South island I recommend doing a loop starting roung the west coast seeing Nelson and Tasman national park on the way. You can also get an iconic picture at Nelson lakes and see the seals at a really cool place near Westport This is a great spot for jumping on rocks f youre into that. Further down the west coast there are sooo many things please google including Pancake rocks Hokitika Gorge Greymouth Brewery Tour free glowworm grove just outside Hokitika beautiful beaches SANDFLIES glaciers and nature at franz josef skydive too and the most beautiful drive down to wanaka and queenstown. Now there are so many expensive things to do in QT and it is a beautiful city but I would not suggest doing all my activities there it can be found cheaper elsewhere. From here I suggest going out to eat some awesome fruits from fruit stalls depending on the season visit the Catlins area down south beautiful nature and cool waterfalls good roc jumping nugget point is iconic too. Dunedin is a beautiful beautiful town and there is loads to see in and outside it including the railway station oceanview beach tunnel beach the chocolate factory larnach castle not worth it tho. If you go north from there you will pass by Oamaru good penguin beach and cafes skip Steampunk HQ! it sucks. If you take a route going a bit more towards the mountains again you can go to the lakes Pukaki and see Mount Cook village where there is a lovely  hour easy walk with beautiful views of Mt Cook. You will also enjoy the turquoise waters of the lakes. In christchurch there are loads of informational posts where you can learn about the earthquakes and you can experience the discomfort of driving on the beat up roads bumpy  It is still a beautiful city with a beautiful garden and loads of good eating places recommend Tequila Mockingbird. From here you can go to Akaroa for beautiful views and dolphin swimming and some really nice little local pubs.I hope that gives some ideas please feel free to ask for more I love talking about NZ D Happy travels!,solotravel,cphipsx,2,t5_2rxxm

3444384,0,t3_2zd94q,Lots of people have covered anything I could suggest but heres something nobody has mentioned  Getting from Albania to Macedonia if thats the way you want to go. Going from Tirana to Ohrid is quite logical but there is no direct bus you must go from Tirana to Struga or vice versa and then get a local car to Ohrid. The bus station is here  if I remember correctly. Also it is very common for random people driving cars to act as taxis almost like Uber if you have that app in your country. So dont be super worried when random people offer you rides just pay them also be sure to haggle. ,solotravel,cpkvvev,1,t5_2rxxm

3471822,0,t1_cpnm9tq,Before I started traveling in SEAsia I had studied for half a year in Bangkok. So I had already figured out what the prices for locals are how to behave in various situations and when someone wants to scam you. I did not have a budget but I had time and the will to travel on a shoestring. I could have traveled much more comfortable differently but I used mainly transportation for locals and usually ate at the street restaurants also highly recommended to stay healthy  the food there is usually fresh. I usually did some research before I went to another place about what hotels and hostels there are but did not make any reservations in advance. I just walked over and bargained for a cheaper price which I got in many places. You should also check the rooms before you check in because sometimes the pictures look much better than the actual room or there is no running water atm or or or. You must check whether there is a public holiday as the locals might also travel to the same destination and the prices for accommodation increase a lot. I had this in Thailand on an island that is frequented by the rich locals at the weekends and in Vietnam in Cat Ba which is also a typical weekendgetaway for the richer population. During the week it is much cheaper and less crowded. I booked transportation usually a day before I left.It is impossible to speak all the different languages and it is also impossible to learn them quickly. The languages are phonetic languages which makes it difficult for us to speak and understand them. I studied some Mandarin Thai and Vietnamese before but it only helped me when reading the menu of restaurants. What you could do is get a good travellers guide which has important translations in it and then try to memorize for instance the words for bathroom and foodstuffs. In some regions people do not speak English and in some regions the literacy rate is not high. So pointing on a word or showing them a map would not help either most of them have never seen their city from a birds perspective but this should not discourage you. People are helpful and are able to understand when you are hungry or need to visit a bathroom. This happened rarely to me and I consider it as one of my most precious experiences. I think the most important thing to do beforehand is to get accustomed to the different cultures and the dos and donts to not get in trouble or upset the people. ,solotravel,cpo0h22,2,t5_2rxxm

3481026,0,t3_304p4j,I went away for a long weekend in Gent Belgium when I was . Took a train to London changed to the Eurostar to Brussels and then changed again to a train to Gent. Was staying in a hostel fairly centrally which was quite nice although I had so little stuff with me that I didnt leave anything there. The second night it had already gone am and I forgot the door code to get back into the hostel the reception locked at pm I think. Ended up napping on a bench under a tree in a park for an hour or so using my bag as pillow listening to a podcast until my iPod ran out of juice. Then I spent about four hours wandering around the streets. It was one of the best nights of my life. Having never been anywhere like that alone I was completely free. The idea that there wasnt a home to go back to with my parents waiting for me was terrifying but exciting. I watched the city wake up gradually and naturally. All the people delivering things at am ready for when everyone woke up. The people drinking coffee in a hurry trying to find their car keys so they could get the office on time despite only waking up a few minutes earlier. Gent is a gorgeous place during the day but seeing somewhere come to life like that was wonderfully magical. I stayed in the train station for a couple hours after it opened. I saw a homeless man try and steal something from the station newsagent the owner caught him but let him have the item anyway. Barely slept that weekend the day had just started and I didnt want to go back to the hostel and sleep so I stayed out all day again. Having that freedom to do literally anything was bizarre. Since then Ive travelled an awful lot. In  days time Ill be on a flight to Canada via Iceland to start a two year long backpacking trip around the world. That night started it all off.,solotravel,cpp28ux,56,t5_2rxxm
3481434,0,t3_3048pp,What about the weather makes SE Asia terrible to travel to during JuneAug? I can think of two reasons The heat and the monsoon season. I dont think it really makes a difference. Honestly to me SE Asia is pretty rainy comparative to Europe. If you travelled during any other months its likely that itll still be rainy. By rainy Im talking about rain twice to thrice a week monsoon season or not.Im based in Singapore so thats as much insight as I can give. However in some parts of SE Asia eg. Jakarta the monsoon season means frequent flooding. This would be a very good reason to avoid SE Asia because flooding makes travelling very inconvenient and disrupts travel plans. Personally if I left everything to travel indefinitely I would just go for it because its all part of the travel experience. Where I am I wouldnt have the chance to experience flooding but I do believe it would be an eyeopener. Many a time when I experience difficulties as I travel I learn to appreciate the little things in my home country. So if you do decide to travel to SE Asia the main thing is to be prepared of the possibility of travel disruption.As for Europe I actually recommend Europe in the summer. I usually travel to colder climates in Winter and its miserable because you carry a lot of things when travelling in Winter  not the best for moving from place to place. I travelled Europe last summer and it was a really great experience. The weather was perfect not too hot and not too cold SE Asia would be VERY hot and humid.However costwise I do believe that Europe would be more expensive in summer relative to SE Asia. The cost of travel across SE Asia should be much lower than Europe there are also frequent crosscountry sale fares by budget airlines if you book in advance.p.s. I have not travelled across SE Asia that much so the insight above is mostly based on my personal opinion from Singapore having only visited BangkokKuala LumpurMalaccaGenting HighlandsBatamBintan.My personal recommendation would be to travel across East Asia after youre done with China Japan Korea before heading down to SE Asia then Europe.,solotravel,cpp3xfd,2,t5_2rxxm
3500098,0,t1_cpqzn7x,I cant really remember the names are not easy to remember but I stayed in Reykjavik and booked this trip already before I left for Iceland. They picked me up in the early morning and brought me to a farm where I got my first horse. We started the tour had lunch at a farm changed horses and continued the tour until we came back in the evening. It was a childhood dream come true. I have climbed mountains passed geysers waded through a river and the guide told interesting stories about the country. The gear and the food were included in the price of around  Euros but I think the prices vary.I am a semiprofessional rider but the horses are so friendly and safe I would guess it would be no problem to join a tour without having much previous knowledge as long as you are somehow a bit sporty. The horse stay together and are not jumpy at all so you could just let them trot after one another. As I was the only guest that day I took advantage of that and raced through the country like a dervish. Best day ever and I would like to go there again to make a tour for several days. ,solotravel,cpr8iiu,1,t5_2rxxm

A clear mind can be happy anywhere  or at least know with certainty when a situation is stale and in need of change.

Ill still have an idea of the same highlights to see but theyll be more spaced out with days of just wandering around relaxing and usually hanging out with localsfellow travellers.For yourself Id recommend you not book too far ahead and stay flexible if this is possible.

3614506,0,t3_31pcaw,I will preface this by saying that this situation was all my own fault. I was being stupid as hell. I was in Leon Nicaragua and everyone in hostel had gone to sleep. I was slightly drunk and very hungry so I wandered out into the night to search for some street food. I found a hotdog stand and pulled up the stool to sit on as I wolfed down a jumbo mystery meat hotdog.I was almost finished as a Nicaraguan guy that I met at my hostel and drank with the night before walked by and said hello and asked if I was partying that night. After a short exchage I asked him if he could hook up some blow. Mistake number one. We took a collectivo to his place an apartment about ten minutes from where I was eating my hotdog. I waited in the doorway while he went to grab the goods. He took quite a while and I was starting to become a little bit nervous. After what seemed like half an hour he appeared and said we were good to go. Alright were almost home free. Wrong. Walking down the street we were approached by two gangsterish looking Nicaraguans that were asking questions in Spanish. Uh oh. Did this guy steal their business? They got right up in our faces but my friend managed to talk them down after I gave them some cigarettes.Time to head home right? Wrong. My new Nica friend asked if I wanted to het some drinks at a club. Sure why not. We get there and it is a dingy hole in the wall place dimly lit and blasting reggaeton. Might as well have a couple beers. I was the only gringo in the place and started to get swarmed by hookers. They were grabbing at my junk and trying to pull me onto the dance floor. I want nothing to do with prostitutes so I am trying to politely as possible decline and look for an out. I go to pay for my beers only to find out that my friend had run up my tab and silently departed. Also a hooker that was trying to seduce me had broken a glass at my table and they were trying to make me pay for that as well. I barely had enough Cordobas to cover the drinks not the broken glass. After arguing with the bouncer in Spanish for some time I went to leave and lo and behold the metal gate to the bar was chained shut. I was stuck. The bouncer and some other men patted me down and made me empty my pockets looking for any extra money. I showed them that I had nothing in my wallet and they finally unlocked the gate and I ran back to my hostel. I retired to the toilet to test the goods that I had gotten earlier in the night and it was powdered sugar. All around an extremely stupid and risky night where I wasted a ton of money. Looking back I dont know what I was thinking.,solotravel,cq4a2ul,5,t5_2rxxm
3615289,0,t3_31pcaw,I was at the Tokyo Narita airport when the big quake hit in . It was supposed to be a one hour layover. Instead once the shaking subsided we started seeing the devastation on the monitors and realizing that something really bad had just occurred.The airport had some structural damage so they evacuated everyone into the tarmac for a couple hours but then it started raining and they corralled the entire population of the airport into one terminal that had been cleared for structural integrity. Standing room only. There was only emergency power no heat and funky plumbing. I was wet and shivering dressed poorly  having just come from SEA. We ended up being left in that terminal cheektojowel for  hours. During that time airport staff passed out airplane blankets and packets of food from the onboard meal kits. We all got fleas.It sounds like Im complaining and honestly it was an awful  hours damp shivering in tissue paper blanket pressed together with a mob of disoriented strangers...But we knew that thousands of people had just died. We knew that we were the lucky ones. There was no complaining just a somber calm. We felt helpless wanting to take some sort of action but knowing we could do nothing.It was a really powerful experience. The people there all treated each other beautifully. We didnt know how long we were going to be stuck there. Food and blankets were readily passed over to the elderly and children. There was no squabbling over the limited food and water.

Or the sign on the door will say one name but there will be another name on your receipt or your room key something Ive also encountered a lot in South America... maybe the hotels get sold and rebranded a lot?.Its quite easy though. You cant walk on Khao San Road without being offered a room or seeing signs. You can ask to see the room and if you dont like it there are plenty more to choose from. You can also try the side streets for a liiiitle bit more quiet but the prices dont go down that much because theyre rock bottom anyway.I was there a couple of years ago but I doubt the situation has changed much.

Some campsites are firstcome firstserve which means you need to get there early and drive around looking for a site and pay in cash when you get there. For example Reserve America  is one site that some parks use that you could look into. Theres also Recreation.gov and some others that I dont have off the top of my head. You can also call them and there will usually be a number for the park on the parks site. Some places have an automated line though so it doesnt even matter if you call them. Also there are providers who do monthly data plans I just dont have any off the top of my head since Im with Verizon. But if you want to experience these places you can also just head into a place with WiFi and use an iPad or something.,solotravel,cr0uctr,2,t5_2rxxm

4424746,0,t3_3bnph5,other people are giving you advice but i just wanted to add in a few thingsdont worry too much about language barriers. You would be amazed what you can learn to communicate by gesture alone as I did in rural parts of vietnam where no english was spoken. With language pocketbooksdictionaries and smartphone translator apps communication is not as big of a problem as it would have been in the past. Also english rules the world. I just got back from months in southeast asia and was able to get by on english without any major issues. Many people in the tourism industry such as those working at hostels and airports will have some grasp of english. I would recommend budget destinations your preferred countries are expensive and will limit the time you can travel. Compare london where the cost of a bed in a hostel dorm is  to one in bangkok for . You could find some cheap market budget food for  in london perhaps or you could fill up on a fresh healthy delicious bowl of pho in vietnam for . At that rate you could travel for much longer by going to budget countries and then live like a king! They also tend to be very interesting because they are more culturally different than what you already know. Your level of spanish will also be just fine for getting around in spansih speaking countries by the way. ,solotravel,csofkcw,1,t5_2rxxm

4497518,0,t3_3cno82,I hiked Mt Fuji about a year ago with my girlfriend overnight. Be sure youre thoroughly prepared e.g enough snacks water warm clothing waterproof shells lights etc. Many of the supplies sold at the stations on the way up are a bit overpriced bathroom use is  yen iirc. The hike is pretty intense even from the th station and even for an experienced hiker such as myself. The wind and weather can change on a dime at higher altitudes and the temperature will drop significantly even in mid summer. Many people cut the hike into two legs and rest at predetermined stations generally hiking during the day which Id highly recommend I was forced to hike it over night due to time constraints I was only in Japan for a week and Fujikawaguchiko for less than  hours.Hiking Mt Fuji was really the only adventure I had near the Fuji five lakes and Fujikawaguchiko area but theres certainly many other equally beautiful hiking trails in the same area. There are also a number of hot springs and lovely bathhouses in the area too. I was actually in Tokyo for two days before Fuji and had a great time. Depending on your interests and time constraints and whether or not you have a JR Pass and if youre limited on funding I found I was able to do a greater number of things in Kyoto than in Tokyo. Both cities are incredible in their own way both representing old Japan and modern respectively.

MARTA public transportation will get you to a fair number of places within the city but for things off the beaten path I recommend Uber or Lyft. Id also like to mention that although MARTA has dramatically improved in recent years Id still be skeptical of riding alone after  PM. Typical tourist spots include the World of Coke Botanical Gardens and Georgia Aquarium. The more adventurous tourists can check out the Clermont Lounge and if youre outdoorsy Stone Mountain has a great hiking trail and laser show after dark thats pretty cool. You can check out ATLtodo.com later in the day to see what shows and events are going on tonight I think theres a Bastille Day paradejazz event going on later.As far as foodbars go I strongly recommend The Vortex if you want true Americana food their burgers are some of the best in the city in my opinion including the vegetarian burger if youre into that sort of thing. The Cypress Street Pint and Plate is a good casual bar for enjoying local beer and cheapish appetizers and meeting millennials. The Daiquiri factory on West Peachtree is known for strong drinks and very confident members of the black LGBT community. I havent been myself but have heard the people there are great to talk to and will give you a very positive and memorable experience. If youre interested in the LGBT community or a more metrosexual atmosphere you can walk up and down th Street from Peachtree all the way to Piedmont park and hit any number of affluent bars its also a fairly safe part of the city to get drunk in and theres a chance to meet local celebrities.,solotravel,ct6glja,3,t5_2rxxm

Id say if its directly on the way hit it up if not skip it. As for your questions. Never heard of that doubt its important. Also never heard of that. I crossed driving in a rental car filled with Canadians and Americans on the A and nobody asked any questions. If youre in a bus it should be all the more easier.. Why? Good luck I have no idea and if you do find some data plans that work for all of Europe read the fine print. A friend found his plan didnt actually cover Serbia or Bosnia.. Best bet ask the hostel workers when you check in for the bus schedule or go to the bus station yourself.. You want ease of mind book before I used hostelworld. If you want to be daring dont. Youll more than likely always find something but maybe youll end up in the hostel that smells funky or has no outlets.. Have your passport and your train or bus ticket within reach that is literally all you need to worry about. Dont sweat the small stuff.. Kravice waterfalls are ridiculously beautiful you better swim in them. Are you planning on going there on a day trip with your hostel from Mostar? Just dont bring anything valuablenonwaterproof with you. Bring a little bit of money in a ziplock bag. My friend brought his phone and just left it underneath his towel in plain sight. You could also ask the cashier at the snack bar to hold onto your phonecamera. People tend to do well when you put trust in them.As for hostels thats why they have lockers bring a lock with you. Some people also bring a small bike chain to lock their bag to the bed for hostels without lockers which Ive never before seen and must be ridiculously cheap or with small lockers. I for one would find the experience of someone stealing my pack full of dirty clothes and old maps almost worth the loss of it.,solotravel,ctljle7,3,t5_2rxxm

4903688,0,t3_3hsiny,Japan is an awesome country and great for first time traveling. Stick to cheap hostels use public transport instead of cabs and youll get the most out of your k. Read up about each location first in guidebooks online etc and try to guess how much youre gonna be spending. The JR pass is also really good. I got mine before I left but that was years ago and I dont remember how I did it Im afraid. Odds are youll be able to afford a few months of travel depending in whatever the visa reqs situation is   days on entry right? but always play it safe and over budget everything on your first go ie if you estimate daily costs will be  tack on an extra  to be safe. If youre desperate for an adventure and want the longest time away from home then literally anywhere in Asia will be cheaper than Japan. China and SE Asia are very welltrodden by backpackers and generally not too difficult to travel in. Eg in western parts of China like Yunnan your k will last freaking ages. Admittedly though Japan is one of the safest places in the world while everywhere else in Asia youll need to deal with all the normal problems of backpacking like thieves travelers diarrhea etc. Make sure to do your homework. If I had that much savings and a craving for Asia Id probably smash most of mainland SE Asia and take my time about it.,solotravel,cucnbn0,1,t5_2rxxm

5082222,0,t3_3kfpj8,I just completed a two months solo trip starting and ending in Dusseldorf I went through ten countries and  cities.  I ended up spending less than  however I could have spend less.  I had to stay at some more expensive hostels because Im  years old some hostels wouldnt accept me.I suggest you try to end your trip in Istanbul.  That being said I think you have to make a big decision in the start of your trip.  That being do you want to spend less time in more places or more time in fewer places?  Ill give you a semishort list of what I think the best cities to stop through would be and why.Oslo I suggest spending some time in nature Norway has a lot to offer and only visiting Oslo would be a shame Stockholm Gothenburg andor Malmo Youll find these cities much less overrun by tourists and immigrants and thus much more Swedish Copenhagen Berlin theres a  euro night bus from Copenhagen to Berlin Hamburg may be fun to visit however Berlin is cheaper to get to and I think may have more to offer Amsterdam the Hague Ive spent quite a bit of time in the Netherlands and if you want the Dutch experience I suggest you spend less time in Amsterdam and some time in the Hague Amsterdam is completely compromised by tourism and is very far from being the quintessential Dutch city that so many people act like it is Ive never been to Luxembourg before but it definitely looks like an interesting place to go to for a day or two but due to its small size I cant imagine that it would be very fun after the second day.  I found Munich to be a rather boring city and isnt worth more than a couple days at most Salzburg was actually quite interesting for a day trip.  Vienna and Bratislava are quite interesting and are worth a couple days together.  From there you can head to Prague then Krakow Budapest Bucharest and Istanbul.I had a L backpack on my trip and honestly it was too big.  I suggest a L or less which will allow you to bring it as carryon on flights within Europe.  Buy packing cubes and learn to roll your clothes.  Honeslty you will end up not using a lot of the the things you bring with you so packing light is really important.  I suggest getting a daypack like this one Pack light.  You can always buy what you need once you arrive.  My backpack ended up weighing quite a bit too much for my preference Id much rather have had a somewhat smaller bag and brought less clothing trust me when you have to walk several kilometers to get somewhere you need to go youll be glad you brought less.Theres much more I could write but I have to go if you need any advice feel free to message me.,solotravel,cuyln3m,2,t5_2rxxm

The tent sleeping bag sleeping pad and stove he had all looked to be in good condition and worked well. He also rented a backpack his main pack wasnt really set up for trekking and that wasnt as nice and didnt fit him as well as it would if it was his own. When I was there it wasnt quite high season yet so running out of equipment wasnt an issue for anybody renting and I didnt reserve any campground in the park in advance. However Ive heard it gets pretty crowded in high season and it might be worth it to reserve space at the campgrounds in Torres and a hostel in Puerto Natales in advance just so you have the peace of mind you have a place to sleep.

Youll have an advatage over me too since the UK is much cheaper and better located to travel from compared to Canada.Whether or not short trips are worth it depends on you and how you travel not everyone elses opinions and misgivings.

Someone above mentioned Hoi An if you go there you have to look for a place called Banh Mi Phuong they make they best sandwich youll ever have. South of Hoi An is a place called Muine where for  you can go on an all day your starting in the fairy ponds then to a small fishing village truly a site to seesmell then you can go quaffing in some sand dunes and after that watch the sun set over other red sand dunes. However if youre really looking to get a purely cultural experience I would say check out Siem Reap in Cambodia. Angkor wat is there and for  you can get a  day pass and bike around for that time it is an amazing place and probably my favorite thing I saw on my trip. The night life is awesome there too and if youre into it you can buy shroom pizzashakes there.

If it is similar to USD I would say it it isnt a lot if youre gonna take a chunk out for flights. That being said I have managed to do my travels for that money but I travel very cheaply work and CS. Ecuador and Bolivia dont need as much time as you think I ended up spending way more in Peru personally. You could make it all in this time frame I think but I always choose longer time if I can. It gives more breathing space. I should mention that chile is very very expensive especially the Patagonia. Also remember June and August are winter down south you will see lots of cold and little sunlight in the Patagonia.As of travelling by yourself if you travel the backpackers life you will find loads of people your age. There are many solo travellers and you even likely to find someone to travel with. Also travelling longer time means bring Les stuff!!! Do not fill you your backpack!Do you know Spanish??

I stayed a hotel not hostel called the Eiffel Trocadero and it was pretty amazing I was with a friend though so I wasnt solo travelling. Paris an absolute must see though. Jardin des Tuileries to the west of the Louvre was probably my favorite park second to the Luxembourg gardens. I went to Versailles palace and visited the gardens there as well which is a hell of a lot of walking and we actually goofed off and lost the tour guide whoops and got lost on the train and ended up  miles outside of Paris. It was a stunning place but we got bored after the first  hours. So if youre going to be there for a while buy the unlimited train pass for    days however long and download the app on your phone for the Paris metro its like google maps but for the trains. All you really do then is just follow the colors with the app we never got lost with the trains I could even put in addresses and it showed the best train routes. This is serious. If you take a taxi from CDG to your hostel like I did it will cost you more than a week unlimited train pass. I was just lazy and tired and didnt want to figure out how the train worked thankfully I started using the app and it was actually VERY VERY easy.If you really want to see something cool and local go to where the Catacombs entrance is that green building and have it on your left walking while walking south down the street called Avenue du General Leclerc and turn right onto a street called Rue Daguerre across from a McDonalds. Here are the coordinates for Google Maps or whatever .N .EIts a small alley where a lot of locals were buying local groceries and bread and we had a nice lunch there. Pretty neat for just stumbling down an alley we were looking for a cigar store.Do research on the scams and shit they pull there.

The actuarial table says I have less to lose.Here is something to get your head around when planning the money.  Thailand is the most expensive of those countries.  Then comes Laos.  Then comes Cambodian towns out in the sticks can be very cheap there.  Then comes Vietnam.  There are many variables but I would spitball that  weeks in Thailand would cost about the same as  weeks in Vietnam or Cambodia.Another thing spending more does not necessarily make a trip better.  I remember a couple of German guys I hung out with who were moving from a private room into a hostel dorm situation even though the cost was more for the hostel.  They liked the dorm because it was easier to meet people.  This is true even for hotels.  I have met more interesting people in less expensive hotels.  ,solotravel,d15bdix,1,t5_2rxxm

7082844,0,t3_4ckfg3,. Last minute is generally ok. Flexibility and freedom before anything man you dont know who youll meet there . You may have some problems here if you get really picky on the hostels i.e you really want vagabond in sarajevo and for more than one night. As a solo traveller its quite possible you always find that last bed in that last room. But its more than possible that you dont find  straight nights in the same bed for the most popular hostels. Other than that youll be fine. My recommendation is to go lastminute. The only place where I got a no was in Hedonist Belgrade and Old Town in Kotor. And I managed to find last beds in other hostels. So again if you dont really give a fuck just go lastminute it will give you a lot of freedom . Credit card no problem anywhere but be aware of the fees your bank will charge you.

I did a rushed day trip thru the park. You can also do the Lost City Cuidad Perdida  day trek. Both are these are done from Santa Marta which Id use as a quick stopover get in do some of the above and get out.

I am not sure if the plane ticket is included in that price or if that is just spending money. If that is just spending money then I could see you pulling off option . Personally I would take Budapest off if you only have  weeks that leaves you  days in each city and a day for travel in between. If the plane ticket is included in that  remove the Oktoberfest and do Prague Vienna and Budapest. Basically eastern Europe is going to be your best option for the budget you have. ,solotravel,d210eyx,1,t5_2rxxm

Many things arent a bad walking distance or the metrobus system can drop you close by.The Old Town area is basically just a big tourist trap IMO with stores hawking cheap souvenirs or authentic upcharged food. I would do a free walking tour of the area I liked the orange umbrella tour to get an idea of the history but probably wouldnt spend any more time there otherwise.The Uprising Museum is great if youre interested in WWII. I spent several hours there and only touched on part of the whole place.The Palace of Culture and Science has an observatory you can go up to. Ive never been in just admired at night when its lit up. The Royal Castle near the Old Town area has a bunch of exhibits. Again never been in.Wilanow and Lazienki are a bit farther out from the Old Town area easily accessible by bus but I thought the grounds were wonderful. Thats about the closest to hiking I know of in Warsaw. Didnt have time to go inside to check out the palaces.Milk bars are an interesting experience. I liked the one called Rusalka on the other side of the river near the zoo. The Praga district across the river is cool and artsy too.While you can get by with only English I find it polite and helpful to learn a few phrases in local languages even just hello and thank you.

7582542,0,t3_4j2g0z,Hi. Ive done both where I have travelled with friends and alone and although it has its pros and cons when you travel alone you are the one that is in charge of making your own schedule. Its nice. You dont have to wait around for someone or not do what you want because your travel companion is being aloof.  Also when you are travelling alone you can be whoever you want to be that day. If you want you can be social and talk to strangers or if you want to spend time alone you can do that too! You are also going to places  that are more tourist friendly so dont be surprised if another solo traveller all of the sudden just starts talking to you.  Its true that its always cheaper to book in advance and ive done both too. Ive done the book in advance way and the just get a ticket the day before way. There are pros and cons to both. TBH if your schedule is flexible getting travel tickets days prior is fine. It gives you a chance to stay longer somewhere if you really like it or leave earlier if you get bored of a place. If you meet other fellow travelers going in the same direction you enjoy spending time with you can also modify departure times to go with them. Hostels for solo traveling. I found it the easiest way to meet fellow travellers. Its cheaper and plus a lot of hostels are full of information if its your first time there. Depends on the airlines. If the same airline there is no reason. If its a ghetto airline where the airports are in the middle of nowhere and you have to pay for everything under the sun like entertainment food luggage comfort etc then look at the costs there and see if there is a difference. From past experience there is really no concerns. ,solotravel,d343ja9,1,t5_2rxxm

Quoting from your own articlegtHow likely would it be that the government would ignore the result?Very unlikely say experts. Many commentators including at the BBC argue it would be political suicide if the government were to dismiss the result of a democratic vote.gtThe conventional wisdom is that of course a vote for Brexit would have to be respected says the FT. gtHowever the newspaper also points out that conventional wisdom predicted Jeremy Corbyn would not be Labour leader and Donald Trump would never become the presumptive Republican nominee for US president.It isnt being ignored and you are a mug whos made a fool of himself.

While I havent stayed there myself since I live here a friend stayed at Planet Traveler hostel in Toronto and said it was good and you really cant beat the area its in! Id recommend trying for there if you can get in  it was built only a few years ago so it shouldnt be super gross. And again a great neighbourhood thats a good launchingoff point.Ottawa would be feasible en route to Montreal. Its a gorgeous city  lots of green space very clean great museums...but its not a MUST see. I grew up there and am happy to go back for a weekend now and then but its nothing breathtaking or vibrant.  days isnt a ton of time when you factor in all your driving time so Id stick to TO and Mtl. Definitely hit up Niagara Falls for a couple hours! The maid of the mist boat ride that takes you right up to the falls is a must in my books. In terms of weekend music festivals check out WayHome and Osheaga. Toronto has a ton of street festivals all summer too. In Toronto Trinity Bellwoods park is the place to be for picnics and people watching and High Park is a nice nature wander with a tiny zoo!. The Toronto Island is really great to see too!

Which brings me to the next pointgt Are there ones I should be avoiding? Yea. Just like hotelsairbnbsetc there can be some dirty sketchy places out there. I check out hostelworld tripadvisor google reviews beforehand. Like yelp there will always be some bad reviews and people maybe unfairly complaining about their experience but if you look at the big picture and see negative themes in many reviews then its safe to say theres a reason for them.gt How do I ensure I keep my items safe when Im out and about?Lock lock lock lock lock.

8572674,0,t3_4x7rli,fwiw first off Scandinavia is pretty cheap to get to because of lowcost airlines like Norwegian that are based there. Once youre there its expensive but no more so than like Zurich. If you want to go to Scandinavia and its awesome you should dont let its reputation as being expensive deter you.Lodging is always my biggest expense by far when I travel. Going for private rooms vs dorms will definitely add up especially on a longer trip. They usually cost like x more in my experience like  for a room at a good hostel vs  for a dorm at the same place. You could stay in dorms for all two months for less than  but youd probably be spending at least k to stay mostly in private rooms. What I find works for me is spending a few days in a dorm then a few days in a private room or airbnb when I move to the next city and so on and so on. Thatll help stretch your money further while also giving you a break from being surrounded by people all the time.Rail passes are more often than not a bad idea imo. Youll get the best rates if you just have an itinerary a few months in advance and book separate train tickets as soon as they go on sale  days out from travel. Unless you want to keep it very flexible or are planning to go to a new city every day which isnt a good idea rail passes are more hassle and expense than theyre worth.,solotravel,d6d5zwc,3,t5_2rxxm

In my other comments I repeatedly stated that I am not a budget traveller and that Japan can be done for much less.

Im not going to spend a shit ton every day but I have given myself lots of wiggle room just in case. I never restrict myself.An example of my activities would be a Shirakawago tour  cab fare and entrance to the Zao Fox Village  meeting a maiko apprentice geisha and watching her dance performance  a premium oiran photoshoot   a Disney Sea ticket  various traditional craftmaking classes   a Manga portrait at the Manga museum  and the list goes on. Not to mention I love shopping so thats why my spending budget is so high.There are people who spend way more on trips so I would suggest you sit down when you want to spout off on how absurd my spending choices are.

8749495,0,t3_4zwhlh,The other option if you want to see more of the north is go south first and do the island thingFMP and then go up to Chiang Mai since the only thing that has a specific date is the FMP.           That being said heres my comments on what youve written              Thats likely not enough money if youre including the scuba. Thailand is cheap but not as cheap as people sometimes make it out to be and youre only there for a month and planning on seeing a lot so you wont be moving super slow and doing everything the cheapest possible way. Not to mention youre talking about doing things like jungle tours and other tourist stuff that are amazing and worth it but also cost. Also if you plan on drinking regularly that will eat the budget way more than youre expecting.              The sleeper train to Chiang Mai actually stops in Ayutthaya so you could do a night there on your way up to Chiang Mai.         Chiang Mai to Koh Phangan is a looooong journey and if you dont plan on spending multiple days doing it you will have to fly and it will dent your budget a bit. That being said even with flying youre going to be adding busses and ferries and with the FMP expect it to be busy enough and book ahead. Air Asia does offer a flybusferry combo to Phangan where you buy just one ticket I believe it only leaves from DMK but theres so so so many cheap flights from Chiang Mai to DMK. You could also just arrive at one of the near by airports and work out the busferry yourself. If you want the quickest but by far the most expensive option by a lot you can fly straight to Samui. ,solotravel,d6zcc1u,3,t5_2rxxm

I got to Ottawa and I was exhausted but I made the mistake of going out and seeing things because I felt guilty not to do so. It just made me more tired and angry at myself when I couldnt enjoy what I was seeing and experiencing. My next stop in Montreal I took a few days in my hostel to just stay in and watch Netflix for a couple days. After that I went out to explore the city which has become one of my favourite places Ive been to and I had a wonderful time. Take a break from your travel routine and stay in. Do something low key.

9767013,0,t1_dagzngd,Youre white knighting so hard to claim that an entire race and country of over a billion people is literally Hitler.You are making so many fallacies without properly supporting your argument to begin with.Why are you targeting China? Why are you making it about the ethnicity instead of the government? Why are you ignoring that you had nothing bad to say about Burma or any country mistreating the Rohingya? Why did you mention India with its culture of untouchability? Why mention Japan when they still deny committing one of the worst genocides to ever have taken place?Im not saying China is perfect but the fact that youre telling people not to visit it and claiming that ethnic Chinese are Hitler is so goddamn nitpicky considering the other countries you just blanket suggested while ignoring their problems.Lets analyze your listNepal Trek  Impunity has continued for human rights violations including for thousands of unlawful killings disappearances abductions and torture that occurred during the war. Violence and insecurity plague some areas of the country where armed groups operate largely with impunity. Severe poverty remains a serious concern and women lower castes and ethnic minorities continue to face discrimination.India  Grave human rights violations continue as a result of armed conflict in Afghanistan several regions of India and Pakistan. Armed political groups commit frequent human rights abuses while the war on terror continues to provide excuses for grave abuses of rights by governments. multiple serious human rights abuses from remaining a fact of life in many parts of the country. Political and separatist violence and the governments heavyhanded response have threatened the wellbeing and human rights of millions. Economic development has often threatened the livelihoods land and lives of the poor who are in its way. Hundreds of millions live in severe poverty and women religious minorities dalits adivasis and LGBT Indians can face harsh discrimination and shocking violence.China  In China serious human rights violations continue to be committed. This includes torture execution in which China is world leader excessive use of force in public order policing repression of dissent and forced repatriation of asylum seekers without recourse to a refugee determination procedure.SE Asia  Grave violations of fundamental human rights are a daily reality throughout the region. Freedom of expression and association is routinely denied in many countries with political dissidents often sentenced to long terms in prison following unfair trials.Legal frameworks for the protection of human rights are weak allowing human rights abuses to be carried out with impunity and leaving victims particularly women and members of ethnic minorities with little opportunity for redress.Human rights defenders across the region suffer violence intimidation and imprisonment. The death penalty continues to be used in many countries often after unfair trials for crimes that include drugrelated and economic offenses.S. America amp Central America  Many governments across the Americas fail to comply with their commitments to uphold fundamental human rights. Widespread torture unlawful killings by police and arbitrary detention persist. The war on terror undermines human rights in the name of security.Crime levels remain high in some parts of this region due to the availability of weapons and the legacy of civil wars. Governments respond with tougher legislation often blurring military and police roles by deploying military forces to deal with crime and social unrest.Members of human rights groups trade unions and indigenous groups face intimidation harassment and death threats in some countries in the Americas. The reluctance by the authorities to investigate present and past human rights violations perpetuates impunity.Japan  The government was criticized for its continued failure to apologize adequately and provide full reparations for wartime crimes against humanity such as forced sexual slavery and for the way Japanese history textbooks portray its past aggressions.The Diet parliament debated but did not adopt a Bill first submitted in  to establish a national human rights commission.Source Amnesty USAI get it China handles Tibet poorly. However literally every country you suggested and didnt go on a racist rant about has something wrong with it. Some have incredibly significant things wrong with them including genocide mass killing severe poverty and mass corruption. So again you are targeting China for racist rants ALL CHINESE ARE EVIL TRUMP for no good reason. China is not perfect. In fact China is pretty fucked up but in some ways it is better than many places you suggested largely because you just said Cant go wrong with SEA and Latin America.I am baffled by the fact that you are so vehemently AntiChinese but fail to see the issue with pretending that so many other fucked up places are perfect.You do not have a problem with Tibet or human rights violations. You have an issue with a race of people.,solotravel,dah01wr,0,t5_2rxxm

9937900,0,t1_db2uchi,The Everest base camp trek is very overtouristed with a lot of bucket list tourists  folk who go just for the vacation and are terribly out of shape and complain the whole time.  However the Three Passes trek is one of the best treks in the World. You start from the same place as the Base Camp trekkers and for the first two days youre following everyone else however after the second day you lose and Im not exaggerating . of the tourists. I did it with a Canadian lad I met at the pub in Namche Bazaar and aside from Gokyo which was a little more popular we never saw more than  people a day.  The Three Passes trek also includes Base Camp which is very cool I must say and also includes Gokyo which is beautiful and the thing about the Three Passes is that there are so so many side trips you can do. You can stay in Gokyo for four days and do side treks every day. You can stay in Chukung for four days and do side treks every day. I did the whole Three Passes trek round trip for Lukla in  days  of those days were acclimatization days but if youre in good enough shape you can do it easily in  days and throw in a few side treks too.  No guide or porter. Dont recommend it either. A map and a compass is all you need and if you ever get lost you almost always run into a sherpa who will help you out. Although Im a  year old fit male if youre not that in shape or a girl I would still say you dont really need a guide but a trekking partner would be very helpful. Not saying girls couldnt do it on their own but I met zero girls doing it alone and many complained about the difficulty. It just all depends on your fitness i thinkThe only reason youd need a porter would be if you dont think you can carry your bag for a whole strenuous day of trekking. But thats up to you. Personally my bag weighed kg kg with water and snacks with and I was fine.  I would say try to find a trekking partner to do the Three Passes with though. But folk like that are easy to find. If you stay at Alobar Hostel in Kathmandu you should easily find a trekking partner or in my case I was planning on doing it by myself until I met this canadian lad the night before going at the pub.  The one thing about the Everest Base Camp route though is that while it is rather touristy it is way less busy than both the Annapurna circuit and Annapurna Base Camp.  ,solotravel,db2xmg7,2,t5_2rxxm

I was debating whether to go or not and this guy tells me Im an idiot if I dont and that he would double me on his bicycle over to her house.

9995622,0,t3_5ipsg7,The cities you picked seem fine. All beautiful cities with lots of stuff to do. For me Prague is one of the best European cities and I wouldnt drop it if I where you I read below you where thinking about this. Its a beautiful city with a really unique vibe. Lots of stuff to do cool musuems architecture clubs bars and nice people. Zagreb and Split on the other hand wherent very interesting for me. Split was very very touristy in the summer and wasnt much more than snackbars and market stalls. We missed out on the Islands which is the main attraction of Split I know so that might be the reason. Berlin Prague Vienna Budapest are all beautiful cities and a good choice to visit. Time to visit doesnt really matter cities are busy and touristy all year round being to worst in summer obviously. April seems like the perfect choice. If you want some pretty scenes and nature its gonna hugely depend on how you get around. Train and plane mostly get you to the big cities so youd have to get some more local transport. Youre budget also hugely depends on this.  seems hugely exessive to me tho especially if youre doing Eastern Europe. I probably spend around     excluding traintickets in a month roundtrip through West and Central Europe but did a lot of camping. I think  to  all included will be perfectly fine depending on how much your plane ticket will cost you. I dont have a lot of suggestions regarding nature and scenic stuff Ive only been in the Fichtelgebirgte on the border with Germany and Czech which was really beautiful. Seems to fit in your route.

Get off the beaten path and try going to nontouristy spots like the outer boroughs. Queens has a very diverse demographic and some of the best ethnic food around. You can find Filipino food in Woodside area Indian and southeast Asian food in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst delicious Spanish food in Corona and one of the most diverse showing of Chinese food in Flushing. Try going to the New World Mall Food Court or New York Food Court you can get a good variety of food at a very inexpensive price. In Manhattan I really like hanging out in East Village Lower East Side LES and Chinatown. East Village has a very eclectic group of people and good selection of restaurants and bars. If you like unique bars you must stop at McSorleys its the oldest Irish bar in NYC. For food I always like Oh! Taisho Lukes Lobster Minca Ramen and Black Iron Burger. Drinking in Lower East Side is pretty fun I love Verlaine The Magician Beauty and Essex and The Back Room awesome speakeasy. Go to Chinatown for seriously good dim sum highly recommend Jing Fong Golden Unicorn and Nom Wah Tea Parlor. After dim sum you can check out Canal St if youre looking to pick up some souvenirs.

10693672,0,t3_5su0sz,You have probably made up your mind by now but let me add my own two cents. Id advise against the l pack. You could definitely fit everything in there according to your pack list further up but not much more. So for occasions where you have to carry a little more food water etc or when it does get cold and you have to buy a sweater or even for carrying souvenirs around until you get a chance to send them off... The extra l of the other pack provide you with a nice buffer. After all it doesnt mean that you have to pack more it just gives you more freedom. Also it looks like you can strap stuff onto the sides useful! the smaller one doesnt seem to have such options. That said neither one looks very comfortable to me. Have you tried them on with actual weight added? When Im travelling with a pack its usually l or more but thats just because I dont own any smaller backpacks and I can normally fit in my massive multipleperson hammock or climbingcamping gear etc... As for haggling I think theres only one occasion ever where I should have haggled for food from a street vendor in Romania. Its really not done anywhere but that Romanian guy really ripped me off  so stay on your toes  for other stuff souvenirs et cetera you can always try even in Europe when it seems appropriate. Just dont be obnoxious about it and back off when it becomes apparent that the other party is not going to meet you half way. Regarding h flights... Just suck it up  no wait one thing you might want to invest in one of those little adapters that let you plug in your own head phones when the plane has these double sockets. The airlines head phones are always a pain in your ears...Have fun! ,solotravel,ddiz1f1,1,t5_2rxxm

10935273,0,t3_5w592b,Im from Sweden and there are a lot of really nice places to camp at there. You can go camping at camping grounds or in the wild. A camping ground is perhaps a bit more secure if you are not used to camping but going in the wild is more enjoyable in my opinion. There are plenty of places where you can find nice lakes that have already prepared camping spots with like a small shed you can sleep in. Sometimes you dont even have to go far from a city either. I can recommend the lakes around Kolmrden for example. Its a small community that has a lot of lakes around with plenty of good camping spots and great nature. There is a nature path called Nunnebanan that you could check out and there are some old marble mines around there too. It also happens to be where Swedens biggest zoo is located so there should be plenty of information to get about the area online. They also have a camping ground that is really nice and there are good bus connections if you wish to go into the town Norrkping. ,solotravel,de7waal,2,t5_2rxxm

10948921,0,t3_5waar8,Looking for any Nova Scotians on this sub for a few basic questions.  Im taking my first solo trip in early May to Nova Scotia and the more research I do the more I realize that I may be going a few weeks too early.  However plane tickets are paid for and vacation is already requested.  Ive just noticed that a lot of the parks and attractions are seasonal but not really starting until late May or June.  I dont mind highs in the s and lows in the s and not too concerned about missing overly touristy boat tours etc but my main question is   do I need to worry much about snow between May ?  I got a place in the woods and will be doing some hiking and general naturey getting away from the craziness of life but my main weather concern was driving the Cabot Trail.

I also have good quality sunscreen and skincare products plus room for some souvenirs that Ive purchased still with room to spare in the bag.

11021406,0,t3_5xbdpv,A couple of thoughts...Ive been to everywhere youre planning to go several times and Im struggling to think of many if any spots for cliff jumpingswimming. Lake Powell is the obvious one  theres a dirt road on the eastern side of Glen Canyon dam that heads north and dead ends after about a mile. You can swim and dive here although the jumps arent particularly high. You could also swim at Lone Rock beach accessed from US west of Glen Canyon dam near Big Water.Your route also seems very rushed and I worry that most of it will be spent in the car driving without much quality time at your destinations. Sedona to Page via the Grand Canyon in a day? You wont have long to spend at the GC itself and youll miss the best times of sunrisesunset. Rainbow Bridge tour and drive to Zion in a day? Possible but quite an aggressive schedule. Rainbow Bridge is  mile round trip by boat from Page and will take at least  hours. Fruita to Blanding area via Canyonlands and Long Canyon in a day? Borderline impossible. Sure you might be able to drive your car to each of those points within a day but you wont have time to do or see anything. Forget about doing Arches on this day. Blanding to the North Rim via Monument Valley in a day? Unless you want to do nothing more than drive your car to the parking lot at MV and leave again itll cost you  to enter the park this is another borderline impossible day. North Rim to Vegas via Valley of Fire and Red Rock Canyon in a day? Again you can probably physically drive your car to each of these places but you wont see much. From your eastern approach route you need to drive all the way across Vegas to reach Red Rock Canyon on the western side of the city.Personally I would cut Moab and the North Rim out of your plan if you want to do anything more than spend most of your time in your car.,solotravel,deh8va8,2,t5_2rxxm

I wouldnt worry traveling to any of three personally. Portland Maine by all accounts is a nice and beautiful town but you have to consider transportation from Boston. Its probably  on the train round trip to Boston if you buy ahead.  DC and Boston are both expensive with free options. Id put NYC in the same boat.

11446061,0,t3_63di3h,Thank Christ on a pony Im not the only one who feels this way. I first visited Thailand as a backpacker when I was  and Im now . I never understood the whole backpacker lifestyle thing. I mean I travelled with a backpack and stayed in hostels but it was the incessant partying drinking loudness and disinterest in culture that baffled me about other backpackers. I have no problem with drinking and Im very fond of getting shitfaced now and then. But some backpackers just go on solo trips to places like Thailand seemingly with the sole intention to get drunk or stoned in pretty surroundings. I cant stand obnoxious loud drunks. I like when alcohol caters for conversation as opposed to shouting and sleezy behaviour. Very few backpackers I spoke to knew any Thai beyond thank you. Almost nobody shared my intrigue for the amazing food of Thailand beyond Pad Thai or Massaman Curry. I left Thailand with the impression I had done it wrong to be honest. My idea before going was that it would be party central and the full moon parties and all of those things would be amazing. But when I returned home my memories of partying in huge boisterous backpacker groups were few and far between because I simply didnt feel like doing it too much. What I remember most was the excitement of being over the other side of the planet on my own. The fulfillment from simply sitting down to eat some delicious food alone. The thrill of taking a bus to Chiang Khong in the Thai border and wandering around the town halfscared halfconfused before finally securing a place to stay which happened to be with a British cyclist who cycled around the world and set up accommodation in Thailand. Perhaps Im just not extroverted enough to enjoy proper backpacker style travelling. ,solotravel,dftefzo,36,t5_2rxxm

During the daysundaythroughaboutthursdayafternoon its a relaxed beach resort mostly visited by Italian families driving in from other parts of the region for the day but the southern beach road also has a stretch of about a dozen separate gay clubs and bars and on summer weekends thousands of queers turn up all the clubs open up outdoor bars and the entire road turns into basically a massive queer festivallowkey rave.

If youre wandering around tourist spots looking at tourist stuff and taking pictures youre likely to be approached by beggars and hustlers no matter what youre wearing and if youre clearly not paying attention and leaving your valuables unsecured youll be a target for pickpockets. They aint gonna be checking your sneakers against a list of the local fashionable footwear to see if youll make a good mark.

It has a lot of qualities of urban myth. It seems like something that everyone is worried about but that very few people have experienced or even know firsthand someone who has.

Hosteling Internationals hostels are usually on the better side of average and  for a yearlong membership will easily cancel itself out in relative costs if you stay in them more than a couple times in the right cities like San Francisco.Theyre not always in great locations though and much of the marketing blurbs on their websites are bupkis.

11733037,0,t3_67eful,I suggest is heading up to Chiang Mai to visit elephant nature park instead. Although its completely your choice if its out of your way. Its a much better experience in my opinion. As for your suggested items you dont need any of them. Theyre unnecessary. Neck pillows are your best friends for long haul flights. Id also bring some ear plugs in case youre a light sleeper. Id definitely visit the Philippines but I may be biased since my family is from there. But Id avoid manila altogether and visit the islands aka Cebu oslob to swim with whales and CoronEl Nido in palawan. Otherwise everything else is good!! For the motorbike make sure you have an international license if you dont wanna pay a fine. Although its certainly okay if you dont get caught. International sim is free at certain countries for foreigners. I know Philippines offer it and some parts of thailand. But its inexpensive and can be bought at any mall! Get your phone unlocked first as the sims wont work if its a different provider. Feel free to ask anything else! Ill be there as well During that time! Enjoy!,solotravel,dgpyx88,3,t5_2rxxm
