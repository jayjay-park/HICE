8830513,0,t3_514fsf,The Seishen OVA which kind of sort of adapts a tiny little bit of the Jinchuu arc. Its mostly a new very sad story. Some including Watsuki himself consider it a fitting but alternate conclusion to the anime others hate it with a passion.,rurounikenshin,d79ayml,3,t5_2uwpn

9885031,0,t1_daw1fnl,Definitely! Some people from Studio Trigger including one of my favorites Yoh Yoshinari have actually done fanart of American cartoons and even snuck references into their shows. Like you can actually find Squidward inside of Gurren Lagann at one point XD  To further bridge the gap similar to Pierrot animating Korra another guy from Trigger Takafumi Hori actually got to direct an episode of Steven Universe! And there are some other things like I believe Masaaki Yuasa directed an episode of Adventure Time. Fun stuff!,rurounikenshin,daw1k6u,1,t5_2uwpn
