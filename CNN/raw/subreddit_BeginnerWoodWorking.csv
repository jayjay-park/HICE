7522356,0,t3_4ibsit,You can also use a rabbet plane.  Rebate for those not in the U.S.  Paul Sellers has a good video on making one out of an old chisel link,BeginnerWoodWorking,d2x96su,1,t5_3edk4

7770233,0,t3_4lqu2x,Is that pressure treated? And how fast are you trying to cut through the wood?  Also are you letting the mitre saw get up to full rpm before cutting?,BeginnerWoodWorking,d3pevtn,2,t5_3edk4
7776234,0,t3_4ltmwy,Hardwood and Softwood are generally just that hard wood and softwood. You can get quite in depth but from reading your earlier post about where to buy your lumber its not really worth getting into it because its not all that important. Hardwood amp Softwood read these to get a lot more detail but I find it very boring.Generally hardwood takes a lot longer to grow and is more dense making the wood more resistant to scratches and dents. E.g. Ash Cedar Cherry and Mahogany...Generally softwood grow very quickly and dent very easily pine is the most common softwood going around in your area most likely. Its cheap and readily available which is why most homes are built out of it.When I started woodworking I just bought cheap pine to play around with Im Aussie and hardwood is insanely expensive over here its a LOT cheaper in the US and a lot easier to get there as well.,BeginnerWoodWorking,d3q3eyf,0,t5_3edk4

8763072,0,t3_502ouh,I built my first bench just like this a few years ago. One extra thing I did that I thought made a huge improvement was to put down some xs or xs with reinforced cross beams underneath as the top of the bench and then laid down the OSB or plywood on top of it giving you a really really solid surface that you can also easily replace when damaged or used to much.,BeginnerWoodWorking,d711n69,3,t5_3edk4
8941897,0,t3_52qwoy,Im pretty new myself to the world of woodworking so Im unsure of what wood would be best or of any guides on sturdiness. But from my very basic understanding of structures and weight distribution the sturdiest shape is a triangle. Most guides Ive seen if not all are for a triangular shaped sawhorse. Plenty of YouTube videos on this. ,BeginnerWoodWorking,d7mon97,1,t5_3edk4
8995763,0,t1_d7swwqw,Nope not a Detroit thing lol. Yes you can oil the board like normal after staining. Make sure to wipe away excess stain and give it a day to cure before oiling. ,BeginnerWoodWorking,d7t5ghc,2,t5_3edk4
9157678,0,t3_55pcr9,The k is definitely the way to go if you do. I would recommend checking out the Harbor freight version though. Its half the price and made of metal. Its one of the hidden gems there. ,BeginnerWoodWorking,d8cswow,3,t5_3edk4

11377961,0,t1_dflmds7,They recommend not using it to make a cut smaller than an inch and theyre primarily for cutting larger sheets of plywood.  I actually tried to rip a x into a x once with one.  Didnt lose any fingers though it didnt seem safer either.  Ultimately it looked so terrible I went and borrowed a friends table saw.,BeginnerWoodWorking,dflo8h8,2,t5_3edk4
11653434,0,t1_dggvv29,Well to be honest I was confused with the radius of a circle thing.  I think I understand a bit better what you meant but Im still having trouble with how that vs a straight line would help.  Im more curious than anything tbh.,BeginnerWoodWorking,dggxj80,2,t5_3edk4
