5041375,0,t1_cuszh35,I enjoyed myself this year! Ran a  at Star Wars in January then blew out my calf a month later and have lost  of the last  months to injury so I ran this one on only a few weeks of lowmileage training. Pulled off a  that felt okay  footleg felt solid just some minor issues probably due to coming back too fast. Got to run with my friend though which was nice  we stuck together most of the way and had a great hard kick in the last  yards. Finished right behind Sean Astin but didnt realize it till I stopped my Garmin and looked around. They were playing the Rudy theme for him too. P,rundisney,cutodil,2,t5_2sx9g

5304563,0,t3_3nkdlb,Training for the WDW half in January. I am slightly behind because I took  trips to lower altitudes since training started and had to acclimate again after both luckily though when going to Florida I will be used to mile high thin air. I should be all back on pace in another week or so though.,rundisney,cvppx3c,3,t5_2sx9g

Im going to the parks suntuesday but taking wed as a rest day ...I think... family wants to do it and I may but I may just tell them to go solo.My normal marathon time is . hrs for the  Ive done at least so I figure Ill be slower but not looking to set a PB at all.  Im leaving on the cruise the next day and doing the k land to sea challenge thing as well... definitely going to be super sore but I tend to push my body but this is still so different.,rundisney,cwose7d,0,t5_2sx9g
5945610,0,t1_cxyz0hs,I dont understand why they themed it around Avengers. I think they would have been better off doing a generic Marvel and then they could tie in to the movie franchise when a big movie just came out or is coming out. Of movie years could just be more S.H.I.E.L.D related.,rundisney,cxyzzuh,2,t5_2sx9g
6132311,0,t1_cymmzdz,Keep in mind that for the Wine amp Dine they halted us from making the walk to the corrals pending the weather judgement.  I would suspect that if theres a weather concern on Sunday that theyll hold us before letting us through to shorten the walk.  Additionally if we walk out to the corrals and they do a recall they can bring us in the back door and either stick us in cast member buildings Test Track or anything in that area.I suspect no matter what wed end up in cast member buildings.,rundisney,cymoh5p,1,t5_2sx9g

10453370,0,t3_5pq5s9,Its hard to say.  I was at WDW this past weekend and it was low eighties and nice.  Ive been there at the same time of year and saw highs in the forties.  Its likely that high temps will run around  in February and might be in the fifties in the mornings but your best bet is to watch the forecast the week before to get an idea whats coming.,rundisney,dcszpvt,2,t5_2sx9g
10591400,0,t3_5rlo3h,So long as you train you will be good. Some people will tell you they didnt train and were ok but they are the anomaly not the norm. The question is how do you want to feel after the race. The better your training the better you will feel.  ,rundisney,dd8f683,1,t5_2sx9g
10790052,0,t3_5tw1de,It really depends what time you plan on finishing. As of right now Epcot opens at . If you finish between  and  definitely doable. It takes a little while to get through the finish chute and I know I usually like to sit down for a little bit with my finishers box to rehydrate eat something small etc. Its then an okay walk to the front gate   or  minutes depending on your speed. Its also a decent walk from the front gate back to the international gateway and onto the boardwalk.All of that being said Ive done it for both races Ive done Princess  Marathon  and will probably do it this year for Dark Side too.It isnt quicker by any means at least I assume it isnt but Ive never actually taken the buses so who knows but it is something that I enjoy and is a good cooldown to keep everything from freezing up post race. It also lets you stop somewhere hi Starbucks for a giant cold drink or a snack from the bakery in France.,rundisney,ddsx1nm,2,t5_2sx9g
10858950,0,t3_5v5ta5,Uber works great at Disney.  Also since you are in a hurry you should try their new express transportation service.  It is fairly pricy for just a day but is very reasonable for  days.  You can go directly from one park to another park via car without having to go through security.  For instance in Magic Kingdom the stand is between Buzz Lightyear and Space Mountain.  You go backstage then they whisk you to say close to Rockin Rollercoaster at Hollywood Studios.IIRC it was  per person for one day but  for a whole week.,rundisney,de00vpn,1,t5_2sx9g
