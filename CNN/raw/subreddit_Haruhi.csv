715157,0,t1_cglk7p2,Chapter ? I think that was the chapter with little Kurumi ending in the past in her bed? I found the first sentences of chapter  hit me like a train and me truly realizing what is happening. Dont worry everything will be explained! Haruhi does not live in Tokyo. The author fucked up and calls the location of Kitago too as Tokyo while it is very clear it is Nishinomiya a small city in the region of Osaka so we know they dont change towns.

759447,0,t3_22txy2,I always thought it was to see who attracted Haruhi most and hence who would be able to observe her best. You have Asakura Nagato and LN Dissociation spoiler s Kimidori who I will call K. Asakura is outgoing friendly and the perfect personfriend. Nagato is quiet submissive and loyal. K is is a mix of both friendly but not too friendly. Quiet but still human like and while she can be just as invisible as Nagato she can still become present easily. Maybe its not the reason but I think it is something to think about. ,Haruhi,cgqltb3,2,t5_2s2bi
764972,0,t3_22txy2,My theory is heavily based on the parallels to Dan Simmons Hyperion Cantos so its spoiler tagged for those who dont want the books spoiled. Also spoilers for Disappearance.Spoilers The Data Entity is a direct parallel to the TechnoCore. The Core is divided into factionsContinueds . The Stables  those who believe that humans and AIs can coexist paralleling those wanting a status quo in the Data Entity . The Volatiles  those who believe that humans have outlived their usefulness paralleling Asakuras faction . The Ultimates  those only concerned about creating the ultimate AI capable of  prediction capability paralleling the Data Entitys overall desire to grasp Suzumiyas power.Continueds Asakura and Nagato are basically human AIs. They are parallels to the Cybrids a artificial humans with a AI minds connected to the TechnoCore. But Nagato isnt just any cybrid shes the parallel to Johnny the Cybrid wanting to become human. Nagato in the Disappearance is like Johnny in Hyperion. They steal a mechanism that makes them human in protest against their organization endangering their lives. Nagato also parallels the cybrid Joseph Severn from The Fall of Hyperion.Continueds Kyon kinda parallels Endymion and Suzumiya parallels Aenea. Which means Nagato sorta parallels the Ship AI too Okay. I think this parallel is a bit of a stretch. Read this off a tumblr blog and it kinda made senseKyon really ought to read the Hyperion Cantos Nagato did loan him the first book to read... it might help him avoid a bad end Then again I havent finished The Rise of Endymion the last book in the Cantos so I cant exactly say what kind of ending that is.,Haruhi,cgr8e5x,1,t5_2s2bi

892743,0,t1_ch5qdrx,Nope. Actually neither of the orders is how the series was written. Chronological is closer out of the two though.The scrambled order only covers really the first book or so. Which the books themselves are in chronological order but the order of the books is slightly scrambled.Chronological is the closest you are gonna get unless you reorder the episodesmovie around. But as it stands chronological order is basically the intended order. The book goes a bit out of order simply because of the order it was written major stories in order but some minor stuff is scrambled. And the endless  comes after disappearance which is weird.But the broadcast order is way off.,Haruhi,ch5rc80,1,t5_2s2bi

1668820,0,t1_cjp8cj2,Hey man every time somebody asks this question on this subreddit I always insist on the same thing.  At the very least first watch the broadcast order of season .  Let me tell you why while trying to not spoil anything.  If you look at the charttable that uDrRad put up youll notice that there is actually a method to the madness that is  broadcast order.  If you notice the episodes that are called The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya are all in order but have been split apart.  This is what is important.  I believe that season s plot is basically what is found in these  episodes and when you get to the very end of broadcast order Melancholy VI you will definitely feel fulfillment that chronological order would not give you.  All the other episodes are more or less slice of life filler that provides pacing to the true plotline.  None of the other episodes are really related except for the  parts to Remote Island Syndrome.   I am one of those people that uTaiboss is referring to.  I will defend broadcast order until the last bullet.  If you want more explanation I will provide it. edit  As for sub vs dub.. Honestly the sub has a great cast.  Aya Hirano Tomokazu Sugita? aww yiss,Haruhi,cjpilok,6,t5_2s2bi

Because it is LITERALLY THE BEST PART OF THE ENTIRE SERIES!! It will blow you away. No joke.But to answer your question yes there are light novels that continue ther Haruhi story. Look at it this way that Disappearance movie I mentioned is the th novel in the series... there are ELEVEN novels out so far. And THINGS GET CRAAAZY. happy reading.

For a long time I dismissed it as one of those moe fluff series that I have no interest in funny thing is I had the same wrong idea about Elfin Lied lol that involved bunnysuits and singing and dancing.What actually got me into Haruhi was TV Tropes where Haruhi is literally the Goddess of Tropes. It would be easier to list tropes the series doesnt use or play with. After reading about it I went on Youtube and watched both seasons. This would be about October . A month later I ordered the first novel and on Black Friday ordered the dlx box sets of season  off Amazon for about  each D and the next  books as well as getting Disappearance on BR for Xmas the perfect night to watch it for the first time. In  I started buying a ton of various haruhi figures. Before you know it I had all the books that were out and the chan series even the first  volumes of that crappy manga and was writing messed up fanfics.I guess its clear I got very obsessed with the series rather quickly. I think I was very depressed at the time and something about the series made me feel better and to this day something about it makes me happy.
