9766048,0,t1_dagrpgg,Im not saying the construction crew costs more. Im saying the return of donation. I dont see anywhere on twitter although I did not look hard where they guaranteed an end point.

The return per dollar going down as the number of donations goes up TO DIG A HOLE IN THE GROUND? ,holidayhole,dagvrxv,7,t5_3hpos

If you know where the hole is not divulging due to subreddit rules you can see theres a major sand processing plant nearby.,holidayhole,daht1xj,6,t5_3hpos
