7017674,0,t3_4bqiw8,Im here to see if I have a pillow problem. My bf said to stop buying them but my mattress is always skipping off the bed just enough for all my two pillow to sand which against the wall and I dont want to get up remove them and push the whole mattress against the wall for it to just happen again in a few hours so I grab more pillows till Im at about  pillows and then I decide thats enough and I get up and fix the bed. But see thats just my limit not counting his pillows so I really think I need two more for his side that will be pillow less when Im at my max  side.,toomanypillows,d1bsvff,2,t5_3date
