1258704,0,t1_cib7ury,Yup ideally starting in different locations so there is a rotation of order. The only way to not be invited back into a box is if you dont follow the rules.  I think you have a small...almost insignificant chance...maybe not even a chance...of being a member of another box.... P Ill send your invite via personal letter haha.  ,wicked_box,cib7wp3,1,t5_321ay

1888357,0,t1_ckgqhjy,Yea man no doubt.  I went to the post office this afternoon and got a new box to put everything in.  I repackaged a few items as well to make me feel better about their next voyage aboard the SS USPS.  I REALLY wanted to take the time to label many of the items to make them easier to distinguish but figured you guys would kill me if I held on to it that long.,wicked_box,ckgqlwg,1,t5_321ay

2286947,0,t1_clu3mqj,Interesting results thanks for posting.  Monetarily it looks like you easily made up your output.  Bummer that there wasnt better diversity or more interesting products but you did end up with a few gems there.,wicked_box,cludtbk,1,t5_321ay
2312005,0,t1_clxh28f,Since the soaps are not my scent I would have had no reservation throwing in one even if I took out nothing. If its a particular box that is an issue its the people involved up to that point. As far as putting myself in your position it has come across my mind that when afforded the free time required to curate a project like this I would love to start my own box. However how can I empathize with such a lack of communication?,wicked_box,clxh9iy,1,t5_321ay
2616540,0,t1_cn01cuf,Yeah I think a lot of us are on vacation so it will probably only help overall  ,wicked_box,cn04c59,1,t5_321ay
