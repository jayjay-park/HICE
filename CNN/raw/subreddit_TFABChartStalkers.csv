2778174,0,t1_cnjuit8,Thank you SO much!!!!  Its so reassuring to hear from someone else.   I really appreciate your response!!,TFABChartStalkers,cnjvajp,1,t5_34cxf
2873438,0,t1_cnum40r,Most of em are just fine honestly.  Theres a link in the sidebar that discusses choosing BBTs between that and the reviews on Amazon that should help in choosing one. Id recommend my own but Ive got one of those fancy fertility computer things a LadyComp and while I love it its a bit overkill for most people.  Honestly its overkill for me anymore!Ill put a plug in here for the TempDrop with which I have no association whatsoever beyond having placed a preorder because I think the concept is awesome it takes your BBT for you without you having to wake up at a consistent time to do it. Buuuut its on preorder only right now expected release sometime this Spring.,TFABChartStalkers,cnupld7,1,t5_34cxf

4781412,0,t3_3gcxtd,Im not exactly an expert at charting so I cant say for sure but why dont you put in your nonadjusted temps and make sure to put in wha time you temped and see what FF has to say? If youre keeping track of both itd probably be worth it to see the whatif.,TFABChartStalkers,ctx8k11,3,t5_34cxf
5005375,0,t3_3jhtfs,Oh I didnt know you can get all the ovulation signs over and over again although I have gotten several patches of cm in one cycle before. Im just confused about the temp rising cm drying up cramping around the same time. I also always have long lasting headaches only after ovulation  days afterwards and it started  days after O on schedule. Well might be good if I didnt O yet because  I didnt get a chance to BD much before cd . Thanks ,TFABChartStalkers,cupc3qr,2,t5_34cxf

6158926,0,t3_3zwsjy,Mine is pretty boring right now waiting to ovulate. I suddenly have some breast tenderness so Im wondering if I Od during the day today... Well see tomorrow. Or not.

6426114,0,t3_43p621,Ill throw in a guess for CD  based on your CM readings and the OPK plus the further increase on CD .  Tough one to call though.  FWIW Ive been charting for about  cycles and sometimes I have a mini temp rise before O.  I read somewhere that the very slight rise in temp preO can sometimes be due to your immune system cleaning house in preparation for the egg.,TFABChartStalkers,czjzx4f,2,t5_34cxf
6570608,0,t1_czyy710,I got only negative OPK results with the Clearblue OPK pink my first month so this month I used Wondfos several times a day plus the monitor. My Wondfos darkened but never enough to be positive but the monitor called a peak. I tried the pink Clearblue OPK on the peak day to see if it would be positive since I never caught it the prior month. Most likely Will just be a mystery. Thanks for looking!,TFABChartStalkers,czyyebp,2,t5_34cxf

6979911,0,t1_d16dmxf,That was weird! Still not sure what that was but I did get a drop to my cover line on Friday and AF Saturday  thanks for checking in.,TFABChartStalkers,d17if7r,1,t5_34cxf
7106074,0,t3_4crjwj,My temp went up again today. It looks like if I have a rd day of high temps FF gives me dotted line crosshairs my CM has been extremely infertile for a week.Now I REALLY dont know what to think. Im hoping my temp dives down again so AF comes and I can start a proper cycle.,TFABChartStalkers,d1luiv2,1,t5_34cxf
7220623,0,t3_4ebh2v,Id say CD as well based on temps and CM. Sometimes you can get multiple LH surges before you ovulate so maybe if you had continued OPK testing you would have seen another? FF updated my crosshairs this cycle about  or  days DPO so keep an eye out!,TFABChartStalkers,d1yxher,1,t5_34cxf

7584334,0,t3_4j79ud,My chart started dipping on  DPO and I woke up on  DPO the next day. I figured I was out since my symptoms were exactly the same as PMS symptoms for me and I had two days in a row of dipping temps. I dont know why I even tested but Im glad I did.  days later Im still pregnant. Theres still hope!Edited. Not sure what happened but my first sentence didnt publish the first time!,TFABChartStalkers,d34avga,3,t5_34cxf
7876756,0,t3_4n6tts,gt I temp around the same time but dont log it until later.You can set a default time on FF so it automatically shows your usual time. I was SO happy to find this option ,TFABChartStalkers,d41f4nu,1,t5_34cxf
8107242,0,t3_4qa4qr,The open circles indicate that the temperature was taken at a different time than normal or that you entered you were sleep deprived.  See here,TFABChartStalkers,d4rbru5,2,t5_34cxf

Now I can stop obsessing for a few weeks! Its basically the best day ever! Oh and I can drink at my brothers wedding! Happy day!  So Yeah Duckingcluttered get knocked up next cycle Ill be right behind you and follow you to rbabybumps. Okay thats the plan! Break!,TFABChartStalkers,d5fyseu,1,t5_34cxf
8363760,0,t1_d5mhayy,We can self loathe together! Haha. Mine went up today actually just not above my other temps yet. I hope yours rises soon too!,TFABChartStalkers,d5n0sbg,1,t5_34cxf
8695706,0,t3_4z3erc,Whats your luteal phase length normally? I would wait to see when AF shows up and count backwards based on your typical LP and see what it looks like. It honestly doesnt REALLY matter at this point except for testing...either way your O is behind you and you cant change your timing. At this point its mostly for testing purposes so keep that in mind and dont get too bummed out if youre getting bfns since technically you could be  days earlier than you think. ,TFABChartStalkers,d6slduk,1,t5_34cxf
8730682,0,t3_4zll4o,Its probably a fallback rise which is totally normal. I had one on day three of my cycle too. If so it will be back up high again tomorrow. I know it offers no comfort but you will just have to wait until tomorrows temp to know for sure. Best wishes! ,TFABChartStalkers,d6wzb2i,3,t5_34cxf
9242919,0,t3_56ynpw,I charted for two months before getting my BFP and my first month the jump looked a lot like yours. It wasnt drastic at all. So I wonder if all rises are as extreme as some of the charts people post.,TFABChartStalkers,d8nlv9a,1,t5_34cxf
9616001,0,t3_5cpr21,Im honestly not sure why it took away your cross hairs. I would guess CD is O. To read the message again take out the last temp you entered. Then enter it again  the message should pop up. ,TFABChartStalkers,d9ydbu4,2,t5_34cxf
9627949,0,t1_d9zsriq,Yeah when it moved my CH I was like whaaaaa? Why? I think its trying to see a fallback rise but thats such a stretch.As you said all other signs point to CD. I just played with it and if that troll temp on CD had been . or higher it wouldnt have moved them.,TFABChartStalkers,d9zuccs,1,t5_34cxf
9667915,0,t1_da43ou1,Looks like if I change tomorrows date to like . it changes my O date to one day later. Hmmmm!,TFABChartStalkers,da4ru5b,1,t5_34cxf

10443278,0,t1_dcrodtz,It could definitely be a bad thermometer.  My first one did the same thing  it gave me . a LOT like yours is giving ..  I wound up buying a new one different brand Mabis and it has been a good one.,TFABChartStalkers,dcrts1x,1,t5_34cxf
10485964,0,t1_dcwf0va,whoops! I think I fixed the link.  Apparently I had it locked on my charts status from the last time I posted a question. I feel pretty confident that I have ovulated each month since beginning meds  I have a very significant luteal phase defect without progesterone   days without  days even with progesterone.  Im currently on .mg of Femara letrozole. Are you on Femara as well? ,TFABChartStalkers,dcwoypi,1,t5_34cxf
10544587,0,t3_5qzn8j,I think its saying that because it takes the lowest temperature before a climb that results in three temps above coverline. But I can see what you mean about CD. As you keep putting in more days of temps if they get higher and stay higher you might see it move the crosshairs up to CDI had that happen recently. I think the new data I put in changed the definition of the coverline and resulted in shifting O to the day when I was pretty sure it happened.,TFABChartStalkers,dd3chhc,2,t5_34cxf
10944325,0,t3_5vv4ml, months off HBC things should still be regulating. I know Ive had EWCM for  days and it both good and annoying as hell. Hopefully things even out soon! GJ catching the LH surge last month!,TFABChartStalkers,de8tvq2,2,t5_34cxf

11412516,0,t1_dfpkreg,Im glad Im not the only one at least!Have you ever tried temping vaginally? Might fix the invisalign issue. I actually find it more comfortableeasier than temping orally not to mention getting a prettier chart. ,TFABChartStalkers,dfplili,1,t5_34cxf
11549665,0,t1_dg4b7gu,I was able to find one online at London Drugs.  You can order and ship to home or store and you can check inventory of local stores if you have any close by.
