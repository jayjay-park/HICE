Operations were completed in one month thanks to Britannias deployment of new mobile humanoid armor vehicles dubbed Knightmare Frames. Japans rights and identity were stripped away the once proud nation now referred to as Area . Its citizens Elevens are forced to scratch out a living while the Britannian aristocracy lives comfortably within their settlements. Pockets of resistance appear throughout Area  working towards independence for Japan.Lelouch an exiled Imperial Prince of Britannia posing as a student finds himself in the heart of the ongoing conflict for the island nation. Through a chance meeting with a mysterious girl named C.C. Lelouch gains his Geass the power of the king. Now endowed with absolute dominance over any person Lelouch may finally realize his goal of bringing down Britannia from within!This is number th and st on MAL.

6398998,0,t3_43aivc,This is going to cause so many fights... so lets get into this!Personally I think either way it goes its going to cause problems for one side or another.Lets say the LNs get licensed the first thing that will happen is an Internet wildfire shutting down any and all translations that the licensing can find. They will do this to create demand for the upcoming product release. The next step would be translations of the LNs. This can be done in batch format or linear order. Either way the volume releases would still be around  to  months a volume.Thats  to  months to catch up to the point we are at now.Also another possible ramification of the people we love zx and Daniel yang continuing to translate anyway to get the LNs out to fans is possible legal action. This would depend on the licensing company and how much of a bag of dick they wanna be. However fan translation and distribution of copyright material is still copyright infringement.Thats not even mentioning the cost per LN to buy what we already have.Now for the other side. If the LNs get licensed that would mean some good things for both the franchise itself and us fans.Mainly having the material licensed will bring in more money to the franchise. That will in tern increase popularity making more seasons of the anime more likely and also increase productivity ton of licensed products like figures drama cds and other things of the sort.So  both sides have their pros and cons. It all depends who you ask. Some will feel that the LNs being licensed is bad because it will take years to catch up to the current volumes and we will miss out on anything past this point. Others will feel its a good idea because it will bring more popularity and money into the franchise which will lead to more content and products. Guess what! Both sides are right. Personally I would like to see a row of DxD LNs on my book shelf but at the same time I want to know what happens as it happens not once its done or near to it. So Im on the fence.,HighschoolDxD,czh00v3,1,t5_2xdca

8426778,0,t3_4te4zp,I only have experience with writing fanfics not reading them. But DxD definitely feels like fanfiction which I think is part of the appeal it has. It feels very real. Obviously stories have to sell and are generally changed to serve this purpose but with DxD it feels like almost nothing was changed and youre reading exactly what he wrote including the kinda silly parts. He wrote Dress Break as a joke thinking they would never go with it but they totally did.In case anyone cares the DxDrelated fanfics I wrote are one DxDSchool Days crossover link and one little thing about what would happen if stories were sold in a store and Ichibumisensei walked in to order DxD linkI would recommend fanfics from others if I actually read any of them but I havent.,HighschoolDxD,d5uw04i,1,t5_2xdca

I took statistics in university.   ...  and trust me theres lots of other people in the board who have pretty advanced maths apparently DxD has a lot of geek fans we have quite a few members who have much higher levels of maths than that. OAnyhow if ophis is practically  infinity she would still have been way too powerful. If Ophis  Great Red    close to infinity they would all  still be way too powerful for this series. ... what ACTUALLY happens in the series is that Sirzechs  Ise is able to fight evenly with a portion of Trihexa and a team of various high power guys is theoratically able to kill Trihexa. ... In other words  is something like x as powerful as Sirzechs or something. And Vali has ambitions to defeat Great Red. ... And  in its full form doesnt destroy the Earth in  hit. Or even a continent or even  city. Obviously when they say infinite Ophis  and Great Red do not have DBZ power levels none of them is a planetbuster or such at most they can destroy mountains. ... Were not even talking about power output is higher than a small sized star here were talking much much lower scale. ...I understand that as a fan you want to defend the series and defend the author but just accept it man Ishibumi isnt good at math and so DxD maths is pretty bad. ,HighschoolDxD,d9mm8ce,1,t5_2xdca

Timeline wise it happens after Volume  which is during Season . Though they probably included it in season  to fill the episodes up. As for BorN id sayHalf of volume  was cut everything after Issei defeating Konekos sister Kuroka the second half.  of Volume  was cut or changed main thing that sticks out is how Issei reverted from the Juggernaut Drive.More or less all of Volume  was cut changed or rearranged. The only thing that I think stayed in intact was the date with Akeno though the talk they have about her past was changed... and the special featuring Koneko healing Issei from the effects of the Juggernaut Drive. ,HighschoolDxD,dctes6k,3,t5_2xdca

11256058,0,t1_df7fh0s,How would it get stale? This story is way more than the anticipation of waiting for Issei to lose his virginity. It hasnt been about that since the earliest volumes and even then its not about that. The story is great because of all the different characters and relationships that Issei has formed as well as the setting and awesome story line. Because of how the story is marketed and who the target readers are youre never going to get a sex scene here so best not hope for that. Instead it will likely be skipped over and mentioned after or implied that it happened. There wont be any graphic descriptions though. Anyway its already understood that it does happen in the future so its not a big deal. Its more interesting I think to actually see him be in a confirmed romantic relationship with more than one girl. That almost never ever happens in harem series even the ones where you know its canon that it will happen in the future. Take To Love Ru for example that guy is so resistant to having a harem and was barely able to confirm being in a relationship with the two main heroines that they made an entire sequel series about one of the characters trying to convince him to accept the harem haha. I dont even know if he did. Many other series have that same dynamic but thankfully not this one. ,HighschoolDxD,df7uv92,2,t5_2xdca
