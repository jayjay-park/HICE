2256185,0,t3_2kev4b,IMO its very important to understand what it is you are looking for when performing a ladder test. With larger calibers youd get better results by going to farther distances. If youre strapped for distance to perform a ladder test then you can just get by with shooting each group on a different piece of paper.I usually try to find loads that are first accurate and worry about speeds after.Heres how I do it  Create  rounds of each load in . gr increments starting from  of max book load. Use different colored sharpies and color code the bullets. This is up to your discretion. I actually prefer . gr increments because Im scared I miss a sweet spot jumping by . gr. Yes I do have to load more but I actually enjoy the process so I dont mind.  Print out a bunch of ZeroCall Targets available from page  of this .pdf  basically a page for every load.  Setup your Chrono. For every load put up a zero target and shoot  rounds at a zero target on the left and another  at a zeroing target on the right. Youre looking for accuracy. Some loads just simply dont work and the grouping is unnacceptable. Record the velocities after every shot.  Find the loads that grouped the tightest and take an average of the velocities of that group.  Usually there will be a few loads that really stand out. Repeat the process but with . or . gr for that load. The ladder test part is the velocities you gather. I usually just find the tightest group with the highest velocity and scrap the rest of the load data.There may be a better way to do this. I do enjoy the Snipers Hide articles on this stuff.

Now shoot at a target  yards out. The drop at target would be your height above bore ie same as at muzzle plus any bullet drop which is actually published data or something you can calculate with a ballistics app. If you know that bullet drop at a range and your height above bore you can do some math to get an exact path of the arc and exact point at  yards you want to dial it in at.Draw some pictures itll help a LOT,longrange,cnuhq3x,1,t5_2ts6o

Generally the Tikkas are a little more well put together and have a smoother action than a Savage with very comparable accuracy. Now If you want a top shelf hunting rifle with a heavier barrel for occasional target shooting I dont think you can do better than Brownings XBolt Eclipse series. Fit and finish is better than what both the Tikka and the Savage have to offer and the accuracy as well as the action are very hard to beat.

4464122,0,t1_cstdfy3,It leaves you with more useable Up elevation in the scope. By canting the scope down at the front with a canted base it forces you to aim the rifle higher so your line of sight aligns with the target. If you were to take a rifle with a flat base and put a canted base on it would cause you to shoot high if you didnt adjust. To get zeroed youd end up adjusting the scope Down by the cant of the base moa moa etc... and would then have that much more elevation available to you when dialing in the field. A moa base is pretty standard and some guys run  or moa bases but you need to make sure its not so steep that you cant zero at  yards. ,longrange,cstdpn9,1,t5_2ts6o

5520107,0,t3_3qnd7u,Umm.. hold on here for the Deviant Action. Im running one and can offer some adviceThe standard short action has a Remington footprint but there ARE some limitations. First the side bolt release. Several stocks from Manners and McMillan require they be inletted for Deviant actions because the sides of some of models ride too high. If you get one already premade for a Rem you may have to cut a small channel on the side to fit it. this also holds true for some chassis systems such as the XLR Element. XLR will accommodate you if you tell them ahead of time however the Deviant is not a drop in for that chassis. MDTs except for the Tac KRGs AI NOT AXs and such will all be fine.Next inquire on the features of the actions. Deviants can be made to order and some shops have features built in that can be tricky. A swept bolt handle is going to require extra clearance as will a heavy or modified tang. On top of that the feed port on the bottom has had some small evolutions and higher end stock makers will want to know specifics.That being said I cannot recommend the action enough and none of what I mentioned should stop you from buying it. Just make sure you actually talk to the stockchassis maker before you buy to make sure everything is going to work out.Edit Really? Downvoted? This is all accurate information from my own build.

It could be IPHY inches per hundred yards MOA minute of angle or Mil Milliradian. They are all different and any one of them would be okay. A concern for some is making sure that the scope adjusts with the turrets with the same measurement that the scope has in the reticle otherwise there is extra math to convertTo zero properly you adjust your scope until you have a nice group centered around your point of aim and then you adjust your turrets to  there may be one or more screws or you may have to lift the turret to allow it to free spool and snug them back down. Some scopes also incorporate a zero stop which make it hardimpossible to lose your .Depending on what caliber rifle you end up with you will be compensating for different amounts of bullet drop due to bullet weight muzzle velocity etc. Generally you zero for  yards though there is a reason to zero at a different range if you plan on using your rifle for one thing only. For instance I zero my hunting rifle .SPCII at  yards. I hold low  at  and I hold  high at . But if I need to take a shot on any game size animal between me and  I essentially just need to put my crosshairs on it and Ill hit it.Some magnum calibers do not make sense to zero at  and so a greater distance generally  yards can be used.As someone else mentioned you are only zerod for one specific distance. Closer or further away are both going to require some sort of compensation from you the shooter. Closer the bullet will be impacting high from your point of aim. Further and it will impacting lower. Depending on the reticle in the scope you can use the hash marks to determine where you should aim. You can also dial your elevation adjustment. By dialing your elevation your are mechanically moving your crosshair to compensate for bullet drop and with some practice you can adjust precisely to whatever range you need to shoot at.The amount of info on all of this quite literally fills books...so there is plenty to read. Maybe head over to Snipers Hide and just read through some of the things on there or see if there are any long range classes near your area that could give you a hands on example of this stuff.,longrange,czgi3v3,1,t5_2ts6o

Case volume affects pressure curves and pressure curves affect the velocity and timing and velocity and timing affect the path of the bullet.Weight AFAIK doesnt do zip.Weighing the cases is just a quick way of trying to get the internal volume of the case and its debatably not effective without directly measuring it.

They want as many participants as possible as long as youre following range commands and are safe.And one other thing is to make sure you are familiar with the basic rulesRead up on the scoring procedures and make sure you get a primer on how to pull targets if youve never done so before. Im guessing they run a  relay system at the match where two guys are on the line and two guys are in the pits for each target point. If so youll be fine since the other guy with you should be able to get you primed up on how to pull. If they run a three relay system youll be by yourself on that target point in which case you should ask one of the guys on the adjacent targets to help you get going.Ive got an old video on target pulling that should give you a few pointers Just dont rely on the scoring system I discuss in the video.

Im shooting my first match with this rifle soon and dont know if Ill have the range time to get the SMKs to shoot like the amax did or if it even will or if the eld from hornady will either Ill get some elds and try and duplicate amax performance and keep playing with the sierras in between if time allows.,longrange,d70lpnp,1,t5_2ts6o

Things your smith will have to look out for or potentially modify would be the cut for the bolt handle length of ejection port cut and clearance for a side bolt release to name a few.Yes  triggers will fit. You will not need the bottom bolt release on the trigger if the one you order comes with it. Make sure it isnt there to begin with or is removable.Barrel is up to you. I would definitely talk with your smith about this. I would typically do a  or . for a Mag. Contour and length are up to you. Keep in mind the stocks barrel inlet will only fit up to certain sizes most commonly they come as a Sporter Rem Varmint or M unless youre special ordering one.The LA is the correct action you just need to specify a magnum bolt face and not a standard.Cost depends on how much youre having done.

Bergers which are both more stable and more slippy than the  Scenar and cost about the same.Or if you want to stick with Scenars look at the gr which is slower but is both more stable and has a more stable BC over velocity change.

10919669,0,t1_de6a2n5,Yeah. Once I get the  MOA rail Im going to maybe try one level lower rings.I always have an issue of where the scope is way too low for me to comfortably sight. Big shoulders big arms big head lol I guess. I tried the taller rings at a LGS and it actually felt really comfortable. As long as I sight it in properly I dont know that itll present too many issues at least not for this cartridge. Part of the issue too is I have to run the scope very far back I was worried the scope was going to hit the rail. Like I said once I get the  MOA rail Ill revisit it may end up with lower rings. Not sure yet. Im just going to shoot it and enjoy it for now. ,longrange,de6acey,3,t5_2ts6o

10931768,0,t3_5w5x3g,This is a hard question to answer because it is isnt very restrictive. You can shoot as far as you can see. If you have a nice set of aperture sights or a high contrast target you can see a lot.  Especially if you have glass to spot your shots with.Heres a guy shooting  yards at a  supposedly looks bigger target with open sightsBut theres a lot of difference between what you can do and what its practical range will be. You arent going to hit something really far away first shot. You arent going to see a target that is camouflaged with its background.I have pretty bad eyesight. I wear glasses and have an astigmatism in my dominant eye. At the best of times I cant see a man sized target past  yards or so without an optic but the USMC qualification course covers those sorts of targets at  yards away no problem. Palma shooters fire at  pretty large targets to see them but hit well within the size of a man at  yards and using a restricted  Win.If you can see the target you are pushing the limits of your cartridge at  yards for an AR shooting . w gr bullets and  yards shooting  Win and heavy VLDs like the Juggernauts. And when you factor in wind likely your hits will be due more to luck than any other factor.Hopefully that gives you a feel for the sorts of limitations you would be trying to overcome.,longrange,de7j9jq,13,t5_2ts6o

I asked myself that question  years ago and I figured Id buy a factory rifle and upgrade it as I started to shoot prs matches.Rifle Tikka T Lite .  ScopeampBipodampother accesories after a few matches the rd mag and single feeding the rest of my shots was my single biggest reason to place where I did near the bottom  I just wasnt finishing courses.  So I need a bigger mag and that means a chassisstock.  I really liked the   KRG Chassis I shot a bunch more matches and did a little better my failings are  now  recoil management and comfort behind the rifle.  Ive got an order in for one of the Criterion Tikka PreFits and hopefully switching to .CM will help with recoil management  plus threaded means brake.  In any case thats going to be nearly  when its all said and done barrel tools brake etc..So the finished build will be around   which is pretty close but I could see someone else saying Ill pay the a few hundred more and have it all finished right now and to a better fit and quality than what I would have... ,longrange,dgq8pd2,1,t5_2ts6o
