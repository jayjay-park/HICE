6426469,0,t1_czhmgs3,LOL. I read it someone posted it on CSW as well. Pretty good article. I reached out to the authors already to get insight into which open source material they used for their Orders of Battle.In general I agree with their conclusions although I dont see anyone coughing up  heavy brigades for a forward defense any time soon. Oddly enough unless I missed it in listing NATO forces they left out Germany and Poland the two largest players nearby as well as most of the rest of NATO.,hexandcounter,czk18vt,2,t5_33ymz

7399416,0,t3_4gnnn1,Combat Commander is fun in a different way than ASL. I enjoy both and both have a place on a wargamers shelf.,hexandcounter,d2j9jhm,1,t5_33ymz
7540565,0,t1_d2zbask,Well see if Mitch and I can work something out.  Thanks for the suggestion on howitsVASSALd!  Thats a great idea and Id like to do whatever I can to get people more enjoyment from their games!In the meantime feel free to peruse our howto on the wiki!,hexandcounter,d2zbqlh,1,t5_33ymz

8134220,0,t1_d3rmu3k,gt FitL... would have been much worse.    Interesting!  In my experience FitL hasnt been too bad in terms of rules entry.  I recently took a trio of complete newcomers to gaming up through their weights via Settlers Power Grid Chaos in the Old World and finally Fire in the Lake... with the help BGGs neat little visual printouts they had no real issue groking what they were doing and why they should be doing it.    This may be in part because I was there to clarify some of the less obvious bits  the glorious useblockage of LOCs etc  but on the whole they picked up the flow of the board tootsweet!  Though I may just have a group of prodigies on my hands... P    I havent taken anyone through LoD just yet though so I cant really speak to that... but I will agree all in all Cuba Libre is my favorite place to start simply because of the size of the map  much less daunting visually.,hexandcounter,d4ucysj,1,t5_33ymz
8347091,0,t1_d5jzeb0,Quite probably.  I know the reason I bought Offensive  outrance was because it most closely resembled k.  The question is though why are designers so afraid of nonhistorical settings?  If WW attracts because of the similarity it bears to a fictional universe then surely something based in an actual fictional universe would draw some attention.,hexandcounter,d5kxtxw,1,t5_33ymz
8505246,0,t3_4w7g5u,Im waiting for my copy to come in so I cant comment but GMT makes a solid product. My entry point into HampC games was combat commander which is pretty casual friendly your sis might dig it. Ive long traded it away and moved onto ASL from which I dont see myself migrating but you might wanna check it out! Infantry only btw,hexandcounter,d64pkyv,3,t5_33ymz

11440439,0,t3_63ak0q,  Squad Level Combat in Vietnam  Ive had the first solo scenario set up on my gaming table for like three weeks. I just cant seem to find the time to absorb the rules and get going. I think Ive been spoiled by GMT Games manuals with their comprehensive interactive tutorials. The rules for  arent that complicated but you pretty much have to understand the entirety before you can play a single turn.,hexandcounter,dfsrhgb,6,t5_33ymz
