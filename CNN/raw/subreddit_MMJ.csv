2504738,0,t1_cmeb578,You should make your own tinctures its fairly easy and is much more cost effective than buying them from the dispensary. If you can afford it buy a Magical Butter machine. Its essentially a crockpotindustrial blender combination that has a temperature sensor in it to keep temps at the perfect level. It even decarbs for you during the process. I fill it hit two buttons and walk away until its done. You could use it for all sorts of other stuff thats not MMJ related too. Theyre a really neat kitchen gadget.They cost  but if you use it more than a few times it pays for itself. I made  cups of infused coconut oil with oz of sugarleafpopcorn bud. For a total cost of  I have enough medicated oil to make  pans brownies. At least here in OR that many doses of edible brownies from a dispensary would cost insane amounts. I have yet to see a brownie in a store for less than piece. I tend to feel a little guilty eating dispensary edibles just because of how expensive they are. Paying  to have a good nights sleep is a little ridiculous in my opinion.It has a tincture setting that Im going to be trying next once Im done with this batch of coconut oil.

3030088,0,t3_2ut9mx,As far as his treatment with pain meds goes according to what i found if he doesnt discontinue his use i would say that they may discontinue his pain meds. Some vets require prescription pain meds as well as cannabis. Studies estimate that  of veterans experience chronic pain and nearly half of these patients receive prescription opioids. The VA issued a directive in January  stating that VHA policy does not administratively prohibit Veterans who participate in State marijuana programs from also participating in VHA substance abuse programs pain control programs or other clinical programs where the use of marijuana may be considered inconsistent with treatment goals. While patients participating in State marijuana programs must not be denied VHA services the decisions to modify treatment plans in those situations need to be made by individual providers in partnership with their patients.This would seem to leave the matter to individual doctors however many patients are reporting that their doctors are making them choose between their prescription drugs or their medical marijuana claiming that this is VA policy.An investigation found that on September   thenacting Desert Pacific Healthcare Network director Jeffrey Gering issued a VISN policy stating For safety reasons in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy for nonmalignant pain if UDS detects marijuana opioid therapy will be tapered off and discontinued if patient continues to use any form of marijuana and opioids concurrently.,MMJ,coc2e99,1,t5_2qood

With two other patients you can keep  plants. But you very well may be late to the party for the West coast and Colorado. The smartest thing would be to move to a place that will be the next place to go legal so you can be the first not the Johnny come lately. But the mafia will probably kill you on the east coast once it starts there so pick some place like New Mexico of a Midwest or southern state. ,MMJ,cpii7lz,2,t5_2qood

These particular people are just assholes wearing matching outfits with badges that dont mean that much to me. And with every incident like this theyre discrediting themselves more and more. I do believe there will come a time in my life that their seemingly immeasurable power and big guns will mean considerably less than they do now. Either that or Ill have to seek refuge somewhere a little less plutocratic hypocritical and gungho. Also I dont see any mention of this but did they maybe try covering both of the exits and sending an officer in to speak with someone?

5835020,0,t3_3v58ud,Hello. You know edibles might not be the way to go for her because of how difficult it can be to control dosage. And youre right small doses are the way to go for her. Id recommend a THC tincture and a dose of maybe mg to mg. You can put just a bit into her drink and it should give her enough of a dose to boost her appetite.Yes it will make the morphine work better especially if you can get her dose of THC a little higher. The nice thing is that THC works on a different area of her brain so she isnt going to have a risk of respiratory depression that she would have with more opiates and it doesnt have the nasty side effects of morphine. It can also help with her mood.Good on you for helping your mom and good luck to the both of you.,MMJ,cxkhxqs,3,t5_2qood

8075450,0,t3_4pk8ng,Not sure how this works but Im willing to partake. Heres a brief run down of my life let me know if it worksI have PTSD and have been using Cannabis since  instead of Zoloft Prozac xanax Paxil and abilify. I Was on psychotropic meds from  I personally believe they fucked up my brain chemistry even more  than my already destroyed amygdala and the damage from chronic depression as far as having a balanced brain chemistry goes. At  tried pot it was Reggie it was cool and all but I didnt see the hype I didnt like the illegality of it. I felt all paranoid smoking behind trees in bushes on top of hills lol with my friend. It didnt feel safe at all ptsd.  my best friend had some Lemon Skunk and we smoked in the safety of my basement with music water ect and I understood the hype. I felt violated for taking pharmaceuticals for so long at such a young age. I wondered why they dont prescribe this cannabis to kids like me with anxiety disorders depression and other issues. Pot helped me get to school and pass classes.  I stayed back in th grade because I missed about  days of school... Ive had PTSD since I was . I struggled to get to school in ways only children who have been murdered by trauma could understand. The struggle wasnt only school it was the struggle to answer a phone to answer the door when someone knocks the struggle to sleep through the night without night terrors prior to Cannabis i used to drink vodka with Gatorade to get intoxicated just enough to not have dreams because that horrible useless sleep was better than being  and waking up pissing my bed from a night terror. Cannabis helped me go from missing  days of school a year from th grade to th grade to missing  days of school after smoking pot. With that said in hindsight if I had access to MMJ CBD strains it would be far better than black market miscellaneous dank... At  I was diagnosed with PTSD after a year from hell. At  I sold drugs for a year straight literally a minimum of hustling  hrs a day every day including holidays ect. Often times  hour shifts. Half of that year I was giving in to my suicidal ideation and I tried killing my self everyday for  months. Driving without a seatbelt with my eyes closed at all hours of the day but mostly after I closed up shop and was heading home. The most I went with my eyes closed was  seconds at around  mph. I wanted to die so bad... I would scream when Id open my eyes and not be dead. I wanted it to just look like an accident like I fell asleep at the wheel. None of my family knew of my suffering besides my brother and mother and they didnt know the half. Fast forward Im  started smoking again at . I took a  year break going to group therapy and individual therapy.  Now I do both therapy and smoke Cannabis. Ive had one CBD strain in my life and it was the most medical form of medication Ive ever had. It was also the most therapeutic two weeks of my life. I fell into a depression for a bit afterwards because the CBD strain gave me such a higher standard of living. I cried over it because before that I was functioning at  and struggling everyday to maintain that measley level of functioning.. With the CBD strain I was instantly at  no matter what kind of trigger night terror stessor or any issue... I felt like the me that existed before I was raped had my identity murdered and psyche shattered. I felt whole again for the first time in  years. Theres a synopsis. Im down to do whatever. Im tired of people like me being ducked and forgotten about.Edit I have PTSD anxiety disorder depression disorder mood issues from being rapedmolested everyday from  to  years old then  maybe every once in a while? By two separate people. First was a man second an older neighbors brother.Ill go further in detail if you want my story. The rape is only one piece to my traumatic puzzle.,MMJ,d4nr8mx,1,t5_2qood

But I dont really see Big Pharma investing in different strands for different effects I see them producing the cheapest product they can that meets the standards the DEA will give them  itll be  or  strands that assist with abc and xyz symptoms. My local general practitioner likely wont have a clue about the specific growing process involved. Not to mention Marijuana is different then regular medications in that many if not most will build a tolerance to MJ but can take the same amount of xanax every day because it reaches therapeutic levels in the blood stream. OR Big Pharma will just start pumping out the pot pills already in existence. What bothers me most about the article is the DEA Lawyers quote Dont you trust CVS more than some random dude who sells weed products? Which is a lot like saying dont you trust Taco Bell more than some random dude who sells tacos in your town?  It is a ludicrous argument.

Im not familiar with that disease but you can find the best strains for individual symptoms on Leafly.comId imagine something high in CBD and lower in THC would be less likely to cause paranoiaconfusion while still imparting the medical benefits of mmj.  Id start with Harlequin Charlottes Web or Cannatonic and gradually work your way up to higher THC strains if those dont help.  Ive heard glowing reviews on the Marys Medicinals brand CBD patches available in legal mmj states.You never know how THC will hit someone especially when they have a brain disease like dementia.  If your friend has a weed tolerance already thats a different story As for broaching the subject successfully just say you know of a highly safe medicine with neuroprotective effects that might make life more comfortable for your friend.

You will likely end up with a superior product on top of knowing exactly what nutrients were used and that no pesticides were used unless of course you choose to use pesticides.  You also get the added benefit of cheaper medicine once the initial startup cost worth of medication is produced and the benefits that come from gardening itself.If growing your own or a designated grower is not an option for you than I wish the best for you and hope your situation with Tilray improves or that you change over to an LP who will treat you better.,MMJ,dcvn34y,1,t5_2qood

Even that has variables but I get mostly Kiva stuff in CA that is lab tested and very consistently dosed from one batch to the next and I get the same results every time.   Smokingvaping is hard to be as precise unless you are using the exact same amount same temps pullinginhaling with the exact same amount of force holding it in for the exact same amount of time etc.  And of course every batch of the same flower can vary in potency too,MMJ,dfm3hg9,1,t5_2qood
