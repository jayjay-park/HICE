10607254,0,t3_5rtly9,Yup the Performance is pretty bad p and there are some serious bugs. Not sure if thats a good sign since the game is supposed to launch in April.Running on high preset fps drops into the s at times. Its worse when driving. even when the fps is fine it doesnt feel smooth as if there is some kind of stutter.The driving itself is horrible as is the flying. Outside of that the gameplay on foot can be quite fun but I fear it may become quite repetitive. i kgb DDrGTX  Win  EDIT Turning Vsync off and setting the frame cap to  removed the stutter for me entirely.

10618700,0,t3_5rx80j,Wow! Awesome it worked! It took a while but I teleported to Itacua Delta and took a boat north just pass the bridge then quickly run it onto land towards the NPCs camp at the dock and press F when youre in front of them at about  seconds left. If you die teleport back to Delta and try again.edit Theres isnt much outside of the betas playable area. If you leave the playable area theres just land grass basic textures cars and trains. Thats about it. Theres no buildings or NPCs. If you go back towards the playable areas border after passing it then youll get a timer again and itll kill you.edit  You can also do it at the bridge east of Buena Vida at the north and therell be a helicopter right there. Just take a car rush over the border and melee an NPC. edit  Exploring a bit more I actually found that theres some towns and buildings but theyre missing NPCs and extra details. I got out of my helicopter to explore a town in Media Luna and now I cant get back in.edit  Made it to the salt flats in Koani! I never thought about it but the map is xkm. You can measure it anywhere by putting a marker on both ends of the map and adding the distances up.last edit I explored the west side of the map! It takes a reeeeeally long time to fly across. Theres actually a bunch towns and items that are fully there for some reason with objectives to do. No story stuff. I think about  or  of them are there but theyre not that different from the ones inside the beta area... they pretty much all feel the same.,Wildlands,ddb8lny,5,t5_2u9ll

They know how to make a game They dont need me telling them how to improve there physics engine  days before the game is released around the world.

10928450,0,t3_5vw4dl,Back in the OG XBox days I snatched up everything that had Tom Clancys name attached to it. I cant tell you how many hours I had in the very first Ghost Recon its easily my favorite military shooter of all time. I loved spending  minutes before every mission planning each squads movements and coordinating attacks. Sneaking through empty woods to take out a lone patrol of a handful baddies without them ever returning a single shot was one of the single most satisfying experiences of my gaming life.Every GR since the second one has removed some tactical aspect and has been a let down to me. Each one more disappointing than the last. I never even finished Future Soldier.Ive only played a couple hours of Wildlands so far and Im not quite sure what to think. Im not going to compare it to The Division because after the beta I didnt buy it. It just didnt grab me.What I like about GRW open areas that let me sneak up on enemies and disengage if needed. Spending time to coordinate attacks can be satisfying when everything works as planned. Issues I have The enemy line of sight seems strange. I can be  feet from one and they dont see me or Ive been  yards away in brush and be spotted. When I do spook a lieutenant and they run they dont actually run away. Some just run in circles and never leave the camp. I had one hop in a car and take off  but I found him down the road sitting in it after crashing. When things go to shit the guns feel heavy and slow. Its not a fast paced shooter so when youre spotted and youve got enemies coming at you its almost impossible to stand and fight. It almost seems like you have to disengage in order to try to reset your squad and try again. I havent had a successful standoff yet. But that may be by design this is supposed to be Gr after all.Overall so far again probably only  hours last night I found GRW somewhat enjoyable but flawed. Its still not what I would consider a true GR game but it does try to be more tactical than I remember the past couple being. Ill play more but Im not sure if Ill end up buying it right away. Ill probably wait until it goes on sale in a bundle after most of the DLC hits.,Wildlands,de76yfp,1,t5_2u9ll

11025866,0,t1_degqmmn,You do realize that the division and wildlands are two totally different games. One is a mmorpg that tried a new take on pvp. Wildlands is a tactical shooter not an mmorpg where level stats and op gun perks exists. Comparing the two elements of the games just because they were both made by Ubisoft is silly. We know Ubisoft can half ass stuff yes. But look at Rainbow six siege. Its made by Ubisoft and is amazing multiplayer. Some could argue its good because they only have to work on multiplayer for siege. But splinter cell blacklist again made by Ubisoft had spys vs mercs. Which was the multiplayer mode for that game. The campaign was great and the multiplayer was quite good also. The divisions dark zone was bad because you had people using op loot driven builds. Wildlands is a tactical shooter. Cant really compare the two. You would be better off comparing it to battlefield or cod if you wanted to compare it to something. ,Wildlands,dehr9kz,1,t5_2u9ll

11616283,0,t1_dgcnioz,Firstly thank you for a more constructive criticism secondly I post here because besides what you think  of my views come from Reddit and thirdly since I started posting on Reddit I have more than doubled my views and subscribers. Now I know I lack the skills of a great youtuber and my channel is tiny I only have  subs and I appreciate all constructive criticism as a pose to people just being rude. But having said all this I just do this because I enjoy it and I like sharing my videos with people. I work two jobs and mostly I edit my videos at work  on my crappy laptop. But its my thing I enjoy it and my channel is growing every week even though I know Im terrible at expressing myself my videos are badly put together and my lack of any sort of editing skills is obvious I still enjoy doing it. Other people enjoy watching me do it and as a hobby I think its a pretty good one. Im gonna play the game anyway so why not make a video about it? If you like it great. If you dont thats ok but as long as I enjoy it Im gonna keep doing it and I can take criticism as well as the next guy. I just dont see the need for someone to take the time to post something just to be rude about other peoples efforts or lack of. I can understand negative criticism if its constructive but criticizing just to be rude and to have your opinion heard so you feel important at the expense of putting someone elses efforts down I think is just pathetic sour and miserable. There is a saying in my language. Para gustos los colores. I dont know exactly how to translate it but its something like for different tastes different colours.So like I said in the beginning my channel is consistently growing at a slow rate but consistent every day it grows in views positive comments likes and new subscribers. I dont pretend to be a good youtuber I dont even consider myself a youtuber. Im just a guy who likes gaming and likes making videos in his spare time to try and help other people who also enjoy the same things I do. So if I defend myself it is because Im being attacked If I am being criticized thats life. Para gustos los colores.,Wildlands,dgcps7u,0,t5_2u9ll
