154282,0,t1_cevqnnb,As one of the few people who still visits that site I can tell you that the answer is no. The mass storage device hack only allowed read access and required a particular firmware. There was also a hack way back when that allowed for a couple different programs to sync with the Zune but it was Windowsonly and also required a particular firmware. The protocol was cracked maybe six months ago but as far as Im aware no one has actually implemented it in anything nor has actual code been released.,Zune,cew05qh,3,t5_2qmv8

1419941,0,t1_ciu9gfr,Just look at the box it should be on there. Probably where the bar code is.  IIRC pawn shops are required to check the serial numbers of things and run them against a list of reported stolen items that the police maintain.  File the report in the city the theft occurred.  You should call the county police office where the theft occurred and tell them what happened and provide the serial number.  IANAL TINLA.For more robust advice I suggest you make a post at rlegaladvice.,Zune,ciu9nd9,2,t5_2qmv8

3331576,0,t3_2yak1u,Very handy information.The Zune database is kept in CUsersXXXAppdataLocalMicrosoftZune. I think it is actually ZuneStore.sdf. If you have software that can edit that database you could have a more versatile approach at momving things around.,Zune,cp80xw9,1,t5_2qmv8

8201346,0,t3_4djt89,OHMYGOD THANK YOU! I thought my Zune was bricked for sure! This worked perfectly. I was dicking around trying to get it to work with Linux via mtpz but couldnt get it to. Was resetting my Zune after it not connecting to the Zune software and Microsoft being the shits that they are took down the servers. They really shouldve thought of this and added the firmware to the Zune installer before taking them down. Id give you gold if I had money right now.Zune  here. ,Zune,d52q01c,1,t5_2qmv8
