4715777,0,t1_ctoyb6c,I can easily fit coins like quarters half dollars large dollars and ASEs in my punch sets that I have but when I get an order for a coin with a diameter that is different than those I have to do a bit of centering by eye which is not a good way to go about it or measure out lines on the coin with a fine point pen and digital calipers. I dont often do coins that are an unusual diameter so getting a spacer or collar for them would be a thing that I wouldnt get much use out of.,coinrings,ctoynn0,2,t5_31uqx
