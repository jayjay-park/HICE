6748380,0,t1_d0h8ood,Its not all based on the three rounds. It depends on the games you play before leading up to it. If your Elo was around  it wouldve reset to somewhere around  perhaps lets say or even . This amount would be a little higher than the requirement for gold. So lets say gold is around  youd get put a little higher or  for example. That way the matches you play during the month will affect your league the next.

6753187,0,t1_d0hi5sv,Mate I know the numbers you gave me werent real. The real numbers arent rocket science either and I have no clue why you didnt use them in the first place. Diamond is Gold is .Notrocketscience. As explained everything between  and  gets dumped to sub  again. Drop below  in placement and you are back to silver with a trashold of a whopping  elo points..You guys honestly think  elo and  elo is the same and that goes to show how shit your whole system is. There is no reward for good players other than a slap in the face and layers of RNG. You said I was wrong but I am saying it again  Its all based on  rounds. Because it is.Faceit takes a giant dump on skill in csgo and layers it with RNG to judge bad from good players. Just amazing. Also since  points and  points is the same mind raising my elo bar to atleast ? If not I guess there is going to be a bunch of innocent bronze players getting their hopes destroyed. You guys love smurfing though so I dont really expect anything from you....And in the meanwhile people at silverbronze cries over smurfers and cheaters. I sincerely really wonder why that could be...  To any noninvolved If you are good at CS dont play faceit. If you are decent or inexperienced feel free to stick around. Just know that smurfing is worse in faceit than it is in matchmaking and that faceit loves smurfs more than players who belong in their skill group. I guess there is one good thing to come out of it all though. Since I had unlimited I was placed in a league. And since I won the K faceit points I actually sort of earned money of unlimited! Not only am I a bad customer who will problably not rebuy in the nearest futureWill gladly do so when you guys get your elo system shit sorted great service otherwise but you guys also lost money by having me as one!
