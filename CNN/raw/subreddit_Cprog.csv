2130951,0,t1_cl6orc3,Its worth considering.On one hand theres the appeal of centralizing C activity on one subreddit so that everyone contributes to the same pool of activity. As rcprog is growing that may be useful.On the other hand theres the risk of innundating the subreddit in more simplistic content and comments. That is if we run weekly help threads well bring in the kinds of people currently swarming rCProgramming students mainly needing to finish their assignment in the next  hours. Its risky.As always Im keen to hear more input on this idea. Let me know what you think. Perhaps we should just run a help thread once and see if it gets any activity at all? I dont want to rush into it because its a concession on the founding idea of this subreddit ,Cprog,claovmo,2,t5_2sbyg

3174852,0,t3_2wi3b0,Possibly the compiler will do some more constant folding and it may place the variable in memory that will generate some kind of access fault if you write to it Eg segfault on Linux. I dont think its actually allowed to merge it with other const variables that have the same value but Id have to check the spec. ,Cprog,cor2m7u,2,t5_2sbyg

5508441,0,t1_cwfmzey,I appreciate your honesty  I can understand most of your criticism but ftm does not occur anywhere in this code. Ill assume you meant fmt which stands for format. I thought this was widely known but maybe I was mistaken. The Go formatting tool for example is called gofmt and the package which exports Printf is called fmt. I know Ive seen it used several other places as well.,Cprog,cwfr58v,1,t5_2sbyg
