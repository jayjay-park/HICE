3066105,0,t3_2v6udy,Well you are using the wrong kind of search input for the navbar.I have coughed up a couple of examples for youDeal with Sign In never being on the same row in collapsed mode.Or make it part of the button group along with the search button.I am sure there is a hacky way of making the sign in button on the same row in collapsed row but right now I too lazy to figure it out.Maybe someone who knows CSS better can figure it out.EDIT Oh and I assumed you were on ...,bootstrap,cofsrao,2,t5_2tqnh

3141178,0,t1_conhytc,Id like to help out a bit. Any chance youre open to uploading your work to github or mailing me?I just noticed something in your source that might be useful to know.You should generally load javascript at the end of your document. There a couple of reasons why.Firstly most modern browsers will attempt to load css concurrently all css files at once. This fails if you load javascript before or in the middle of css inline or externally.The other reason for loading javascript files at the bottom of the page is that this allows the entirely of the dom to load before larger js files. The end result is that your page will load and display faster.I also notice that for each team you have a separate form and each buy button is the submit for that form.One of the best practices for development is the DRY principal. Dont Repeat Yourself.What I suggest as an alternative is to use simple buttons that call a javascript function when clicked passing in the team name to the function. That function should then set the team name in a single form on the page say a hidden dropdown or by inserting a value into a hidden text field and then submitting that form.This will help clean up your code and make it far less verbose.,bootstrap,conkw7f,1,t5_2tqnh

5173338,0,t3_3lskl1,Hmm in your pastebin it doesnt look like join is in a modal at all so Im a little unclear on your intentionsIn general though Id check out the bootstrap docs on modals You have the requisite containing elements with the proper attributes. Within that you have a modalfooter element within which you can nest a forminput to be used for search.,bootstrap,cv9kskc,1,t5_2tqnh

8903794,0,t1_d7i24yr,Thanks.But at my example I will set my button CSSs danger and lg not to be used on other element.    .button.danger     .button.lg How about those styles of CSS above ? I can ensure the danger and lg class wont be used on other elements. Actually they can be used on other elements with the requirement the other element must have the same CSS declaration with button but with different properties of course.Talking about generic what do you mean by generic ? Is it semantic or others ? ,bootstrap,d7i3vq6,1,t5_2tqnh

Heres a quick tip which perhaps you already knowIn chrome right click on your page amp select inspect element. You can then view your code amp page at the same time.
