4720193,0,t1_ctovx44,Dont have any stars yet but I thought maybe the  bonuses for each one might go up or something... not that someone with all the stars necessarily needs extra points but maybe one is extra xp and moves from  or  over the course of the  stars maybe another is extra gold maybe another is extra loot etc.  i.e. some of the various options from some of the weapons might be nice bonuses.  And increasing those each level would be even better.  ,Victor_Vran,ctpipl4,2,t5_36fgg
