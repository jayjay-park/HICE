568299,0,t1_cg4txls,Yeah were going MondayWed which is why I figured there might be a  table or two in Harrahs.Thanks for the info!,Craps,cg4vd3f,1,t5_2t18o
1008990,0,t1_chiy3zb,I believe you only get paid the final number of points made. At the table I was at they laid a marker down on each point that was hit and when he finally ed out they stopped the game and had the pit bosses come over to verify everything was legit.,Craps,chizacw,1,t5_2t18o
1095426,0,t1_ch0d6qv,Late to the game The Best  in SHV are Margaritaville Horseshoe and El Dorado. Everything on the south side of I is garbage and Sams town is extremely small and cramped feeling. The drink girls are best prettiest at Margaritaville and most consistent at Horseshoe.  ,Craps,chssyhr,1,t5_2t18o
1511298,0,t3_2bgcvg,I set dice not as a means of controlling the roll but controlling myself.For me the practice is more superstition than skill. But I find that if I set dice and control my rolls I enjoy shooting to a greater degree and generally have more fun as compared to when if I am unfocused or frustrated!. Setting the dice calms me translating into smarter decisions throughout the night e.g. keeping cool when jerks approach the table leaving at appropriate time.In terms of success I have had a few nice rolls when setting I have hit features twice. And this year Im up overall! So there may be something to setting.To be sure I set both s up and give the table a little massage before picking them up to shoot. Feels good!,Craps,cj5pttf,6,t5_2t18o
1569404,0,t3_2bq1r7,I dont like handing in money.   I will make some world bets for the boy some yo bets and some line bets with shoes if Im up pretty good.  You gotta remember   Youre usually it the only player at the table.   I would say  of the time Im the only one tipping as we play.   If Ive hit them a few bets and theyve made say  to  during the session  I feel no obligation to hand in additional money.  Not to mention the money I risked for them that they didnt get paid on.   It just sucks you can have  guys at a table and only  or  guys supporting the crew in the process.  Everyone should tip regardless of their bankroll.   ,Craps,cjczy5p,1,t5_2t18o

4147948,0,t1_crse69a,ukaellinn mentioned Casino Royale and last time I was there Nov  there was still a  table with x odds.Its hard to get a spot but its a lot of fun because people are throwing around money like crazy even if its not all that much in total. Tip the dealers though and be courteous because they get to deal with the biggest dopes in the craps world who want to play at low limits but dont know the rules or etiquette.,Craps,crt2xv0,2,t5_2t18o
6369060,0,t1_czcrzr3,Yup Dollar come for the crew.  Dealers can get in a significant amount of trouble for betting their tokes.  With that said wording is everything.  Theres a difference between telling a dealer they can bet it anywhere vs they can put it anywhere especially if your boxman is strict about that sort of thing.  ,Craps,czdlccp,1,t5_2t18o
6539813,0,t3_4573t0,It was also the same roll a guy has  on a hard  which i hit and got tipped  for it,Craps,czvrq6u,3,t5_2t18o
6650100,0,t3_46o8m7,I know its too late now but...  play pass with like x odds and place  almost exclusively.  Also winning will stretch that bankroll! When I started playing I usually would limit myself to  loss per session on a  table.  Most of the time is was enough to play for several hours winning or losing unless it was just an awful table.,Craps,d076exz,1,t5_2t18o
6860277,0,t1_d0tn6zf,Rode the pass line table min with x odds behind place  or  if  one hit took the money the next hit press to the other number. Then press till I filled  the table. Also played the hard ways. If was a good run. Rolled about twenty times once.,Craps,d0tx6p7,2,t5_2t18o
7242932,0,t1_d21c6ww,LOL ha nah theyre cool with me. I do love Reno...and I feel the same way about Shreveport. They have an environment that encourages one to play longer. ,Craps,d21gvxc,0,t5_2t18o
7306087,0,t3_4dy4ze,I appreciate either to be honest. But I guess if I had a preference it would be someone betting it. Obviously bets have house edge and then the dealer bet would have the house edge against it as well. But from my experience people that bet for the dealers tip more because they win when the dealer wins. I can never underestimate a consistent tipper. I had a guy playing  hands at a time on Blackjack putting me up for  cents on each spot every single time. If I dealt  hands in an hour conservative estimate and he won just  of those hands conservative estimate I would have accumulated  dollars in that hour. Now in some houses there are certain bets for the dealers that are fantastic for the dealer. Especially for  bets on craps. If there is a  bet on the  or  on craps it pays  plus down we take the  down and a total of . True odds on that bet would only pay .. Also with the  and  for a  it pays  as well and true odds would only pay .. In those cases if they only have a dollar on those bets for dealers they are considered better long term for the dealers to make more money.,Craps,d28ni94,1,t5_2t18o
9277665,0,t1_d8rvxn5,Its not. The article is overly simplified and suffers because of it. I found myself slightly annoyed reading it even though I like the message of you should try this that its attempting to get across. ,Craps,d8s0e9k,1,t5_2t18o
10266018,0,t1_dc7mapx,People are generally afraid to play dp because of the come out seven. That wont change no matter how they play the dp. Also certain casinos offer better comps. And there are some where you can getter better comps by just asking. ,Craps,dc7pjh2,1,t5_2t18o

11174176,0,t1_deyhuab,Im the opposite.  I dislike the socialization and prefer not to have people around me.  I prefer machines because I dont feel crowded.  I guess tables are for you and machines are for me.  To each their own.,Craps,deykwn2,2,t5_2t18o
11273051,0,t3_60se3a,Yes. The casino. ,Craps,df9s8ac,10,t5_2t18o
11559578,0,t1_dg63y60,The most fun for a dealer an experienced one anyway is when a player bets numbers and consistently presses them. I love a full game with  or  players on my side all betting place bets andor come bets. Oddly enough the more work and more thinking we have to do the better. Craps dealers are craps dealers bc we actually have to think. Mindless games like BJ and carnival games are torture for a dice dealer! ,Craps,dg6a6h6,2,t5_2t18o
11713273,0,t1_dgnnxqo,I know. Ive been cleaned out plenty of times with that strategy. But just as often I see every passliner at the table get cleaned out while my chip rack fills up. I realize this is completely anecdotal but I know for a fact Ive won more than Ive lost with this strategy. ,Craps,dgnq907,2,t5_2t18o
