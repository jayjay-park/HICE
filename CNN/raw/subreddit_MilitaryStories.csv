336956,0,t1_cffojyb,Excellent!Moms gotta love them. When I was about  or  a group of friends and I played Junior Marines. At one point we had the grand idea to make napalm in glass canning jars wed wrap the jars with rags and set them on fire throw the jar... the predictable result about  acres of burnt scrub brush and pine trees next to our neighborhood. The fire department contained the fire pretty fast. The Junior Marines disbanded and melted into the void.,MilitaryStories,cffp22b,20,t5_2zwzz
428734,0,t1_cfp1cln,I confess I had read Starship Troopers as a kid... uh more of a kid than I was then. I totally stole FREEZE! from Heinlein. It was hard for me not precede it with DROP AND... but that wouldve been so wrong for the situation.Thank you for the kind words about my writing. Its hard writing nonfiction. If you dont fill in the blanks with something that seems realer it loses truth  reads like an dull After Action Report. I hope that it is obvious where Im doing that.Some of the stuff in quotes is absolutely wordforword though. I did in fact say JERSEY FREEZE!! not yelled  I reached down into my diaphragm and found the voice I had been using on the radio for fire missions. Thats where my command voice had been hiding I guess.Likewise Jersey absolutely said wordforword Like your shadow Sir. ...have breakfast with your own death is a real thing. And in Part  so help me I actually pointed to the cobra head with the machete and said Dont touch that. It can still bite. Word for word. The grunts were staring at me with little o mouths. That was fun.The true speeches are little tent pegs in the stories that keep them on track. The made up dialogue is as close as my memory can get to what was said probably parsed and chopped and edited for space. Of course you have to leave out all the ums and uhs of real speech. Read a court transcript sometime  real life speech is Not Suitable for Literature. I um came. Uh I saw. mmmm... eh er... oh yuh... I conquered. does not ring down the ages.As for my command voice in print freezing you... doubt it. I had a confrontation with a truck driver this morning trying to explain why he should stop driving across my property. He left unimpressed I think.So Im guessing what froze you is the same thing that froze me. Dude snakes!,MilitaryStories,cfp7c1h,7,t5_2zwzz

One of the things Ive rediscovered here on rMilitaryStories  is how bad my memory is and how much Ive forgotten. Mostly OP you remind me of the daytoday business of living outside  small things  the feel of bamboo leaf turf under my jungle hammock the cool of the morning the heat the mosquitoes who go for your elbow and three inches up toward your shoulder cause that skin is just hanging there and youre not paying attention... Ive forgotten the physical memory of things. Not you. Not yet.Which is why I like your writing style OP. All that aliveintheworld stuff goes in even to the point where the the action scenes seem to fade into the background. Thats how I remember it too  a real and immediate  interface with the environment around me. Made me feel more alive  all that world around me with me in it. Rain on me. Bugs on me. Find some place to shit. Cant get away from it all cant wall it off. I was part of that I was living there impacting and being impacted by all that life. Makes the indoor comfy convenient muffled screenstaring daily life back in the world seem like being asleep while wrapped in styrofoam. Makes me feel less alive. Stopped having breakfast with my death. Might be a mistake. I think its creeping around here somewhere. Sneaks up on me while Im watching TV.So thank you for that.

2537839,0,t1_cmpdo9j,gt Only an idiot or an asshole kicks his dog when its on a hard point and wont come when you call it.I am so stealing this. Perfect.I never had a pointer. I did have a horse who was more or less on constant alert. It was his opinion that checking out whatever had got his eyes bulging and his ears up and rigid was my job. Mostly  oh pretty much all the time  it was a false alarm. Which was okay. It was annoying when hed go all strained and goggleeyed at the only yucca in the corral. Id yell at him to cut it out but he never did. Hed just roll one eye back at me I swear boss somethins there! Just go look! We wont KNOW fer sure until you go look! I went to look. He was so grateful plus I owed him. He wasnt wrong all the time. I wouldve missed a golden eagle mantling a cottontail and few other things that made the bother all worthwhile.Anyway I knew plenty of people in the Army who were asshole or idiot enough to kick a dog on hard point. I dont remember any of em in the field. Im guessing they didnt last long if they were dumb enough to leave the wire. I bet thats still the case.A good infantry company is like intelligent quicksilver flowing downhill. It breaks into curious prying pseudopods. You can block some of it but a droplet will get behind you then the part in front of you will rivulet out and around and join up with the droplet and suddenly reintegrate into one larger unit big enough to fuck you up. And when you turn your attention to that threat here comes the other pseudopod that you had pinned down. Then the whole thing flows together and youve got an infantry company way up into your shit.Martinets like little rectangles  some with infantry Xs some with cavalry s some with a toodrunktostand E  with little flags on top one for company two for battalion etc. They bump the little rectangles together at military school and go pewpew under their breaths. The rectangles never talk back. They just follow orders until an unlucky roll of the dice removes them from the map all neat and tidy.gt I loved being an E with a team. A lot of the time things were left to my discretion. Id get guidance on what we were supposed to be doing but the details were left to me. At the same time that was a lot of weight to carry. The trust from above and from below and being right there in the middle...I dont think Ill ever have the same burden of responsibility ever again. Damned if fucking up wasnt the most shame Id ever felt but nobody got hurt because of it and damned if the highs werent the best Ive ever felt.Intelligent quicksilver  many things then one thing all in an instant. Yeah if that doesnt make you high put on a toetag and lie down.I wasnt that alert when I was in the field  I was on the radio a lot doing math listening to my rounds. More than once I was startled away from my maps and compass and radio by a hand on my shoulder pushing me down to a less exposed posture. Id turn and see a squad leader at the other end that arm not even looking at me staring into the the jungle making flicking gestures with his other hand that sent grunts snaking out through the bush gonna go look on the other side of the yucca.gtnow Im gonna keep BirdDog in the back of my head ya bastard. Just scratch my ears and tell me Im a good boy and throw me a bone once in a while. Gotta go with what I know Youre a good boy. Saved my bacon moren once. Heres some oats and hay.

3310765,0,t1_cp5ia6u,Damn that was good ditty.You hit it.  I thought that stuff over.  I was inpatient before Afghanistan and DID it.Its like after betrayal.  It all came back.  Like I never had  years of peace.  Sort of like the coping skills for that got lost.You and AM both mentioned something about civilians.There was a comment earlier about how good it feels to express and get it out without the person interrupting or trying to comfort the person ranting.  Just let it out and never held it against me.  I miss that and now they let me rant as long as i dont bullshit them.  A military listener will listen good until you drop some bullshit.  Then he will correct you and let you continue to rant.  Its like as long as you are honest joes will listen.  I like joes that check me.  Joes with courage to call a man out on bull or bad behavior.  You are so right.  This is like a relapse.  Brought on by something she drug out of.  What was the quote AM used? strip you bare?They got me again today.  Wore me the hell out in less than an HOUR.    ha ha.  Im not sad now.  Pissed.They did like a reality check thing.  To sort of find the real reason this crap is happening.  As I answered her questions she... Sort of steered me into clarifying and identifying key events since I got out. no coping  mechanism for anger in the civilian world is first. My first job after failed to keep commitments. the law was unable to assist me. I got a ticket defended myself and almost won.  The da did not want to lose.  He lied.  The judge let me off as he knee.  But i Los because the DA was more interested in not losing to an amateur than in justice.  This destroyed something.  I couldnt believe it was all about winning and loosing. after this betrayal where I used to program.  I tried again. the new boss lured me with promises of partner. he didnt pay my unemployment insurance or health.  Still has my last paycheck.  I couldnt whoop an old man. I moved invested everthing and got a company stock certificate of a company that had no assets.  I freaked.  I didnt know grown ass men could do this.  I was not equipped for civilian life. the state of missery was unable to assist me without me inviting expenses almost as much as my Las check.  Fuck it.  I let the mother fucker keep it.  I lost it.  Freaked out and had thought of breaking legs destroying cars and killing a poor defensless  year old.... ASSHOLE!!!!!!!! I LOST MY FAITH.  Why?  Why program when they just use you? I stopped cutting my hair.  Why?  No point. that WAS TWO FUCKING YEARS AGO. so I moved and didnt get a new house. I found a job at half salary where they would allow me my depression and appearance.  I quit wearing slacks and tie. this man held my checks so I could not leave unless I gave up the cash..then she asked when I turns off the anger.  Its been two years not one week as I thought.  That realization is painful.Ow that hurts.  I thought this was because of you guys bringing up old shitYou guys I thought you caused me to tip.  Made me sad.  But it was already too late two years ago.  I turned it off.  And now I am having difficulties defending myself from... Get this word she used...  a predator who preys on vets.. She made me ANGRY and then she let me scream and rant unto I was to tired to continue.  Good tactic to shut me up.  I mean I just did ALL the work.  She kicked back and let me ROAR.  Exhausted again.  Weak. To weak to go break a leg.Today I received . paychecks of the  he owes me.  Hes holding the damn rest to try and keep me here and it PISSES ME OFF.  I was able to stop repossession of my truck this morning before my session.NO ONE in the military EVER FUCKED ME used their position for personal gain tried to cut me out over MOTHER FUCKING MONEY?!?!?!?  WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THEM?No one ever told me grown ass men could be like that?  I was TOTTALY unprepared.  I found out the difference between a law and a regulation.Fat cats are protected from me by law.  They can call a cop.I am protected by useless regulations that require a lawyer a judge and more paperwork than you can imagine.We took a company from  employees to !!!!From . million a year in sales to TWENTY FOUR!!!I finished the eWIC Project beat IBM to market with USDA and and TX and NM depts of health.When I started my boss made  a year.  When I left each of the four owners were making yr.  He bought his wife a hummer.  Cashed out with FUCKING million dollars a piece.They gave my fucking software AWAY!!!!When I went to collect my    of nothing was nothing.I didnt know you could do that.They said partner and sold the new company to themselves and  new guys... And left me out!!!!!The new company did not legally have keep the commitments of the old.  How did that happen?So she pulled this anger out and really fucked me.Now Im even madder.  The lady left me to tired to go kick some ass.  Damn I want to kick some ass.  Stripped bare and to weak to fight.  But NEVER to weak to get my babble on.Good phrase ditty.

6314119,0,t3_40635v,Ugh. I worked at Ramstein from . Saw plenty of HR Air Evac. Basically anyone who got fucked up in Iraq or Afghanistan during OIF and OEF. Used to coordinate ambulances and such to take patients to Landstuhl hospital had to coordinate with folks to ensure proper storage of the remains as well. Flag draped metal boxes coming out of the back of a C were far more common place than they should have been. Sometimes family members would fly out to Ramstein to ride home with their fallen brothersisterson. If I recall correctly those were Blue Banner missions. Something like that. I remember when Pat Tillman the NFL star who got killed in Iraq came through Ramstein. Took two missions because his body was in pieces. They sent one piece through. His brother met that one. Our wing commander went out and met him. We sent em back stateside. A couple days later I saw another blue banner for Pat Tillman and thought it was an error. Nope just the other half of him going home. Nobody met that one on its way back to the states. And then of course there was Jessica Lynch and her crew. People always tend to forget there was a group of guys who were captured and rescued along with her they came through and CNN and all the major news networks crowded around Spot  on the flightline. The recently freed POWs were out on the wings of the jets waving at everyone. We got a call from TACC apparently they were seeing this all on a live news broadcast and had to call down to the line and tell the guys to get off the wings because it was bad for our image or unsafe or some stupid thing. The news reported it was the th Airlift Wing that controlled that mission because Ramstein is their base but in reality it was the rd AMS Air Mobility Squadron we were a tenant unit on Ramstein and reported to TACC back in the states that controlled the Lynch mission. Ah well. Back to topic I had to ask what an HR was the first time around too so dont feel too bad. ,MilitaryStories,cz7cg11,1,t5_2zwzz

I like the idea and the flair to ID the content but a quick couple of clicks on rhistorians lead to every comment made by that individual which I think would muddy up the intent of being able to quickly get to content or reading lists.Not knocking you I think that defineitly could be incorporated in parts.

7107285,0,t1_d1lvbyl,gtRereading my comment I feel like Im brownnosing.Naw. This subreddit is all about encouraging military stories. Some of this stuff is hard to write. Telling me I should be compiling a book is encouraging. Thank you. To borrow a phrase from collegecampustalk this subreddit is a safeplace for a lot of people some writing all of em reading. Criticism and praise on this subreddit is a prize above gold. Cant get this audience just anywhere and I take seriously everything  good or bad  that is said to me here.Besides my experience with being told to compile a book is nothing like brownnosing. It gets pushy sometimes.Folks have even threatened to sic my daughters on me if I dont get busy. The younger one is trouble enough but were both terrified of my older daughter. Soon  very soon  shell be at a point where she can make people offers they cant refuse. The girl is gonna be the social director for the cabal that rules the world. Not someone you wanna cross.gt My maternal great grandfather was in the th Light Horse at Beersheeba and my grandfather also mothers side was one of the Rats of Tobruk.This is too cool. The Mods say family military history is allowed. Hearing about the the Rats of Tobruk or  holy smokes!  the th Light Horse at Bersheeba would make me feel young again.,MilitaryStories,d1lzi9c,4,t5_2zwzz

7195968,0,t1_d1vs36e,Today when youre overseas in the military you have the internet skype voip phones hell even satellite phones. Back then if you wanted to call home a transpacific phone call was VERY pricey. In fact just for fun I placed a stationtostation call to my parents from Australia thought it would be fun to give them a thrill. The call was  minutes and as I recall I paid somewhere around  for it. The MARS program shortcircuited this by using military radio frequencies to bypass the superexpensive part of the call leaving just the part from somewhere in the US to the target telephone number with reversed charges. As I recall you actually could go to one of the USO sites at some of the major bases and make a regular phone call to the states but VERY few ever actually did it as it was even more expensive than my call from Australia.,MilitaryStories,d1w4f9d,3,t5_2zwzz
7204006,0,t1_d1x0iwk,American Marines are easy. If its shiny salute. If they are an officer and their rank is not shiny dont salute. They only wear the not shiny ones in country or in the field when you are not supposed to salute anyway. As a corpsman with the marines in my service uniform I would get saluted by the boot marines all the time because its drilled into them that if its shiny you salute.,MilitaryStories,d1x1dni,27,t5_2zwzz
