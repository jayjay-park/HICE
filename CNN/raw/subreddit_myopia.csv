2986296,0,t3_2ubyz8,I have . in both of my eyes and astigmatism in my right dont know what it means but the Optician said it was nothing to worry about and I only wear glasses to the movies airports etc.I went for a checkup after not going  years and she asked if I hadnt worn my glasses much because my prescriptionvision hasnt changed at all.Do not wear your glasses if your Myopia has happened due to your work demanding you see things up close. You dont need glasses for things that are up close! You only need them for things that are far away! Do not use them at work OP it wont help you.Unfortunately we can only slow the aging process we cant stop it.NOTE I am not a professional this is just my experience.,myopia,co7iz7g,1,t5_2tuvu
