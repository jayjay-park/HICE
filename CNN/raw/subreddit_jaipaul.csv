9747732,0,t3_5dspip,The AutoModerator keeps messaging me when I update my posts. I dont know if thats normal but it keeps thinking Im making new posts when all Im doing is editing my stuff.Also its kind of hard to tell when you choose to have your flair onoff. Theres a faded outline around the box you tick but its barely discernible. Just wanted to know if you guys could make it more easier to tell whether you ticked the flair box or not.,jaipaul,daemcat,1,t5_2wy4v
