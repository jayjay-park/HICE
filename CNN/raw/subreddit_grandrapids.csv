242527,0,t1_cf5a1fj,Why do you carry?I think youll agree that for most people the answer to that is for protection. And that answer makes sense sometimes like for instance if you live in Tombstone Arizona in the s or rural Alaska or Detroit. The point is the purpose of carrying a gun is to protect yourself from what you perceive are threats to your life. Whether or not you are ever actually in any of those areas where something like that would actually be a legitimate concern I cannot say.Firing a bunch of rounds at a stationary target that A is not a human being B is not shooting back at you C is not moving and D is easy to see does absolutely Nothing to prepare you for a reallife confrontation. Having that gun on your hip in a bad neighborhood does not make you safer no matter how much range time you have. This study from the University of Pennsylvania found that those who were carrying guns when they were assaulted were . times more likely to be shot than those who werent carrying. Than pistol on your hip is more of a danger to you than it is to anyone else. Yes sometimes you can successfully fend off an assault with a gun but your chances of success are remote. Your adrenaline is pumping the person is likely wrestling with you. Your assailant is likely not alone and is probably armed himself. The idea that having a gun will protect you from an assault like this seems to assume that the assailant is  coolheaded and rational and will conveniently stand completely still  meters in front of you in broad daylight allowing you to calm down and take your shot. If not then he will stop his assault immediately and politely excuse himself. Sorry but thats not real life. If someone pulls a gun on you pulling a gun on them will start a gunfight not calm everybody down.Guns are not fun toys. They are weapons. Their purpose is to kill...either animals or humans. It is instant lethal force you are carrying. It is death in a fraction of a second. Do you really think youre a responsible enough person to handle that kind of power? Heck even the police with all of their training and psychological screening make lethal mistakes with guns from time to time. Human beings are not completely coolheaded and rational at all times. Ever get so mad you punched something? Were you thinking rationally then? Of course not. So why would you think that if you were ever in a situation where you were in a complete irrational rage and there are good reasons for this sometimes that youll be able to restrain yourself from using that instantaneous lethal force youre wearing at your hip? Yes right now youre thinking how youd never do such a thing and how you respect the power of the weapon and always treat it seriously. But again nobody is ever always in their right mind  of the time. We all do things without thinking. That doesnt mean youll guaranteed shoot somebody in a fit of rage but having that gun increases the risk you will. ,grandrapids,cf5w1tr,-7,t5_2qi0v

875782,0,t1_ch2lywi,gt We could certainly use better public transit but so could every city but it should be done in a way that doesnt completely ruin traffic downtown like some of the ideas Ive read about killing .Hear hear. One of the things I think Grand Rapids has going for it is the sort of loopandcrosshairs highway layout that means you can get to quite a lot of the city and the center of downtown via an abovegrade freeway straight to your destination and there are enough roads to all points that traffic doesnt get bogged down on the one road out of town.If anything dropping  to anywhere short of a wholly buried tunnel which I believe is geologically and economically unfeasable will make it a lot less walkable. Now there are overpasses on every street and most of the Scurve can be walked under through the DASH lots meaning that you can have your multilane freeway and walkers can basically ignore it. The only actual downside Ive heard about it is that it kills the skyline view but I think thats a small price to pay for the other benefits.,grandrapids,ch3twgq,1,t5_2qi0v

The initial purchase might be blind but I think Caspers inhome  night sleep trial makes up for it.  nights is plenty of time to determine if you like the mattress and allows you to save up more money if youre unhappy with the Casper you bought. Also Casper donates the used mattresses to charity so its a winwin!Online info at Sleep Like the Dead is super helpful in making your decision Edit I used to work in a mattress factory and Id highly recommend a latex foam mattress over a spring mattress. Casper uses higher quality materials than Tuft and Needle but Casper mattresses cost a bit more.

Its not glamorous work I know but its money to be made.Growing up on a farm my dad let me work off jobs when farming was slow. I pumped hog manure worked in a hydroponic tomato growing facility milked cows for a dairy and mowed a lot of yards. There is money to be made you just have to come out of your comfort zone a bit!

3941775,0,t1_cr5jced,gt If its not something you can run your business on its not commercialgrade. That should seem obvious.What? I dont think thats true at all.Commercialgrade is a measure of quality not of use. Something can be commercialgrade and still not allow commercial use. If I buy a set of commercialgrade industrial kitchen appliances and then take them home for a few days they dont suddenly become noncommercialgrade. They dont loose any quality or functionality by using them for personal use. All of the ISPs I mentioned are better products than Comcast Business class internet in multiple objective measures speeds latency uptimes customer support despite charging less money and despite prohibiting business use in their terms of service. They arent lower quality theres no cut corners. They are noncommercial products to justify the price discrimination but they are also commercialgrade in that they meet or exceed the quality grading of commercial product offerings. gt At some point in such a system there are shortcuts or other costcutting techniques applied that may or may not be obvious to the end user.gt You wont get premium product for budget prices theres a tradeoff that must be made somewhere.Thats an assumption on your part and its often accurate. But its not always accurate. There are dozens of examples where this is not true. Sometimes the premium you pay for is spent on branding or marketing or due to higher demand or just extra profit margin that the company captures or any number of other things. The extra money youve spent doesnt always go into the productservice itself  its not safe to make that assumption. Almost all of the fiber services I mention above are counter examples to your assumption. They are cheaper because they assume youll use less data than a commercial user but are otherwise identical in terms of quality and performance of service.,grandrapids,cr5lgvw,1,t5_2qi0v

4612573,0,t3_3e36wj,To those who balk at the expense of replacing it and say If it aint broke dont fix it!The problem is one day it WILL break. Its never a good idea to wait until a system like this breaks before fixing it. And fixing it involves major coin and major time. This computer controls the HVAC systems of  buildings using crude radio transmissions similar to that of the walkietalkies used by maintenance personnel to communicate. So yes okay throw a Commodore emulator on a Raspberry Pi and load the program in....wheres the baud s Amiga radio modem hookup on a Raspberry Pi? Oh...right...there isnt one.This isnt a matter of a single PC running a program. This is an entire network of antiquated hardware.Theres also the matter of fact that this hasnt been left alone in a closet running nonstop for  years either. According to the articles the original programmer still lives in the area and is still willing to service it. They also mentioned having to get parts off Ebay. So the system can and does break down from time to time. And and this is the really scary part its run by a custom oneoff program that only one person knows anything about.What happens when the programmer dies? What happens if he gets hit by a bus or has a heart attack? What happens if hes out of state when it breaks down? What happens if he decides to retire and move away? What happens if he just throws up his hands and says fuck it Im tired of dealing with this bullshit and refuses to help anymore?What happens when any of the above scenarios occur and the system goes down in the middle of winter? Burst pipes in  school buildings will be a HELL of a lot more expensive than replacing this HVAC control system with something more substantial.For one this project will require upgrading the receiver hardware on ALL the HVAC units on every building. That requires a lot of engineering and a lot of labor. But when you do that you A have a wireless transmission system that is more secure and doesnt interfere with radios and B is welldocumented and backed by an entire service company. It wont matter if the original programmer is on vacation or dies or retires. Thats the value in a system like this. So yeah if it aint broke dont fix it. Thats nice downhome folk wisdom and may work for your farm tractors but its a positively idiotic mindset when it comes to any kind of automation. I mean who here waits until the brake pads are completely worn off before replacing them? Who waits until their engine seizes up before changing the oil? Saying we should just leave this system in because it works today is like having a  year old car where all parts have to come from ebay and only one mechanic in the world knows how to work on it and refusing to replace it until it strands you on the side of the road and can no longer be repaired. Yes it works today but there is something to be said for planning ahead. That Amiga is not going to last forever. Every electronic componentcapacitors resistors heck even the silicon on the circuit boardshas a maximum life. These components WILL fail at some point. This is not a question of if but when.,grandrapids,ctbzuxb,5,t5_2qi0v

6805526,0,t3_48ymxk,Grand Rapids does have a great beer scene but one thing Im actually hoping for in the next few years is diversification. A lot of new breweries are opening up which is great but the problem is my wife and quite a few of my friends dont drink beer. Michigan has a great cider and wine industry outside of Grand Rapids but inside the city its hard to tell that.One thing I love about Rockford Brewing Company is that they offer really good Michigan wine Michigan mead and Michigan ciders on top of their craft brews. They dont make the nonbeer drinks themselves but they offer it for people who dont drink beer much like Mexican restaurants tend to offer burgers and fried chicken for people who dont like Mexican food. That way if a group of five wants to go out but one of them is not a beer drinker that nonbeer drinker is not left out and the rest of the group can still go to a brewery.Ive discovered that my wife will drink Rubaeus but most breweries dont offer a nonbeer selection. With all the Michigan wineries and cider mills itd be nice if that changed soon. ,grandrapids,d0np90t,12,t5_2qi0v

10024937,0,t1_dbe6f1a,gt  this area of Michigan is strongly school of choiceprivatization with maybe  of people sending their kids to schools outside of their neighborhood or even outside of GR One of the reasons were considering a move out of Chicago isI would love a detailed source like you mention about radius and am searching but in the meantime this is the source that mentions this Grand Rapids Public Schools the largest district in the West Michigan has been hit the hardest by school choice. About  percent of public school students living in the city are not enrolled in their home district.I think I might be confused though on your exact concern So you personally hope to live in a neighborhood where your neighbors children all attend the same neighborhood school as your children? Me too and the article mentions neighborhood charters so I need to do more research. I personally am very leery of charters because of articles like this  One more thing I would like to say anecdotally about what I hear about which schools are good and which are bad peoples opinions generally line up with the median income of that particular area...for instance East GR is highly regarded and also has a high median income...which makes sense as high household income is directly correlated to positive educational outcomes...just curiousare you interested in the burbs at all?In terms of childcare I have heard from people that it is less expensive in west Michigan than elsewhere but I dont really know what to compare it to...I am sure it is cheaper than Chicago but wages are lower here too. I decided to become a stay at home mom once we got here for various reasons one being the high price of quality childcare...I am sure one can get cheaper prices as there are a lot of less than stellar options out here but good daycare places with low child to caregiver ratio experienced caregivers etc for an infant and toddler are quoting  a day including food for part time enrollment  days a week and maybe a little less per day if one enrolls in full time... There are not the huge wait lists I saw in Chicago from what I have seen so far...On the positive side we have hired preteens in the neighborhood for what they call a mothers helper. These girls ask  dollars an hour to watch my  year old while I get things done around the house. We havent splurged on a real babysitter yet but my neighbor has been paying  an hour to a college student to watch her one year old which is way steep for us.

Im willing to bet theyll be just as poor undereducated underemployed as when they started. Probably sicker too. ,grandrapids,dcn9ibn,4,t5_2qi0v

Go in the spring to see great waterfalls the summer to cliff jump into Lake Superior and the fall for the northern Michigan colors. Winters gorgeous too but youll get stuck in a snow drift and die of hypothermia after eating your toes in a desperate move to stave off starvation. ,grandrapids,dcpeuxl,1,t5_2qi0v

The point youre trying to makes by saying theres no difference between  us citizen and a family in iran is that it is easier to help a family here than  iranian which means far more can be done because of our economic standing cultural similarity and you know those convenient lines on maps. B. Saying having a protest actually is effective only works when you can make a positive case for your argument which lets face it isnt possible,grandrapids,dd2izxo,-4,t5_2qi0v

Still as whitebread suburban sprawl and strip mallish as it was since I was a kid.My family still lives in Livonia and I visit once every few months and its a good reminder of why I would never move back to the east side of the state.I cant say with authority that the career opportunites amenities and culture in metro detroit are any better than what grand rapids has but having lived both places I like the fact that GR has the historic neighborhoods walkingbiking distance to most things downtown and its surrounding neighborhoods decent public transit and of course its proximity to Lake Michigan beaches and state parks. Livonia has none of that.Detroit is starting to turn around a bit and there is some cool stuff happening there if OP wants to live a bit closer I would look into moving to Ferndale or Royal Oak.,grandrapids,deyzmhd,3,t5_2qi0v

11338503,1,t3_61rw0n,If you contrast Boelkes stated goal gt We are committed to providing West Michigan with a transparent safe and responsible way to get purebred and purpose bred puppies Boelkes told MLive and The Grand Rapids Press.with the attitude of his opponents gt Mark Martin wants the council to enact a Humane Pet Acquisition Proposal ordinance which would prohibit the retail sale of cats dogs ferrets rabbits longlived birds and large reptiles.you may come away confused.  Why shouldnt people have a transparent safe and responsible way to buy animals at retail stores? gt Boelkes says he is inaccurately being lumped with unlicensed puppy mills. He maintains that the puppies he sells come from licensed breeders and he personally visits their facilities to make sure they are reputable.Licensed breeders and personal visits are nice but the problem  as evidenced in Boelkes previous attempts and other puppy mills  is that retail pet stores have no real incentive that is no economic incentive to do so other than to be able to make statements like this.  While the storefront needs to be clean and they need a few good photos of their breeders for advertising after the photos are taken the money just says get me more cute puppies for as cheap as possible.  You might think that this might not be a sure thing but it happens over and over again.  We dont need to let dogs suffer and these people profit while we wait for the problem to surface again.,grandrapids,dfh770f,1,t5_2qi0v
