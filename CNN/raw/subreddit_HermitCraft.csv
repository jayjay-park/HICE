If it does you can use that to figure out what is causing your sever to leak. Otherwise see if you can add it.

4485927,0,t1_csutmie,A lot of people have been giving me that suggestion and I do like it. I think you should get a reward for killing mobs you dont usually kill in UHC like skeletons creepers pig zombiesbetter rewards for more dangerous mobs and get a punishment for mobs you do usually kill like blazes and passive mobs. The reason you get a punishment for killing  passive mobs is because it prevents you from just killing tons of animals and getting a stacks and stacks of food. You now have to get food in other ways making it a lot harder to survive.,HermitCraft,csw44rm,1,t5_2twma

Edit We cannot base our judgement on who was active on Mindcracks old Minecraft vanilla server before its moribund death because they had people like JSano and Adlingtont who were two of the last few people active on the server and now none of them seem to have any interest in vanilla Minecraft full stop.

11634545,0,t1_dgeitoq,I guess keeping the season going is up to them. They dont want to fill the season with conventional minecraft content that everyone has already seen ie the start of the game. As I said their challenge is to be creative with buildsfarmsprojects. And with that you can fill a full season. If you take a look at the last two seasons the ones Hermitcraft really professionalised the biggest part of the season is about big projects.
