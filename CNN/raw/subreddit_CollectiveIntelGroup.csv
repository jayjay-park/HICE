998794,0,t1_chhsdq7,No actually I didnt want to pick a fight.  I saw a bounty on a white dot with no blue around it targeted and fired.  If he had had blue or orange around his dot I certainly wouldnt have fired and my history of not taking bounties from friends and crew mates stands firm.  So yes watch your back around me because I have a history of taking bounties from white dots that I dont recognize until after I fire.   ,CollectiveIntelGroup,chhtjqd,2,t5_31kar

1970202,0,t3_2h5sl3,I was one of the people that felt like The Last of Us would have benefited from not having any monsters. This reminds me of that.
