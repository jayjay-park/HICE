3019421,0,t3_2un4g2,Because youre a man you maintain your frame and forge ahead with what you know to be right even if others around you disagree.  Because youre a Christian you forgive you neighbors failings have compassion for his weakness and seek to walk together with him in love.   If you keep showing him a different way without giving in to his failings and he keeps coming back for more odds are youve got something he needs but just cant say so.  His criticisms of you are most likely his own doubts about his own worldview coming to light and his way of working through them.  BP guys often know they are not what the ought to be but usually cant figure out whats missing.  If hes huffing and puffing to keep up with you on a simple walk trust me he didnt go home feeling great about himself.  He may make plans with you and then break them for just this reason.  He wants to do them but knows or fears he will end up feeling inadequate and so backs out at the last minute.  Encourage your brother build him up and you may find a true friend in the long run.  These are issues Ive struggled with extensively in my life.  I know all to well how difficult it is to find Red Pill guys in Church.  They do exist but its in our nature to be quiet about it I think.  Books on prayer are all well and good if usually somewhat boring but if you want red pill Christianity read John Eldridge if you havent already.

3024175,0,t3_2un4g2,Youve raised a couple of issues here.One is how to handle people you see regularly but who are going to have a serious issue with your choices. The answer is simple understand that they have a right to disagree with you. They have a right to bring it up with just as you brought it up with them. If you dont want to here politely deflect if they persist raise the level to a more direct deflection after about the third time tell them point blank not going to talk about it. Remember it goes both ways so dont bring up issues with him. If you two can still talk great if not oh well.As for Christians its a bit different but much the same. Most Christians will be of the opinion that a mans number one job as a husbandfather is being a husbandfather and that that means he must cater to is wife and children. You just have to understand that. If you ever directly contradict that in any way they will shut you out. The alternative is to never address that situation directly but to always direct it towards discussions of how a man follows God and through him his family also follows God. Never point out his wife isnt God. Hell naturally twist what you say into yes so we do X for our wives. Without contradicting simply reply of course but what does God wantsaydirect? Never accept the unstated proposition running through many churches now that God and woman are the same. Just without drawing attention to it and never placing them in context always treat each as separate from the other. Any time he tries to answer questions about following God with how he acts towards his wife be ok with that but bring it sincerely back to but what about following God and the actions God directs men to take that is different than what he just said he was doing for his wife. never say that catering to his wife is not following God. Just hold the correct frame if hes smart and sincerely Christian hell eventually get it especially if it begins to work for you.  ,marriedredpill,cobgb6f,2,t5_32dvh

3365673,0,t1_cpbrok5,Ok so what is the approach? Just increasing the closeness as long as she is calm or crossing her line a bit and holding frame while she is getting defensive and bitchy and keep on doing that until shes used to it?Really making her freak out I dont see much point in that level of intimacy any longer. Back when I thought communication was the key to saving our marriage I went for it a few times but now that were doing so good I dont have any desire for it.

3368174,0,t3_2yr4s6,gtWomen are energy vampires. Nothing ruins your life and saps your ability to take risks and go above and beyond like women. Want to hit the gym after work? Too bad because your fucking cunt had a bad day at work is feeling insecure. Get ready for a solid  minutes of raw demotivate. Every insecurity you have ever expressed WILL be thrown right back in your face draining you into a beta nothing. The process drains most men into yes honey okay sweety pie drones.Heres my issue with this. Its soooooo much bitching and whinging. Theyre living in the stereotype where men have no other control other than to be dominated. You read that and you realize thats coming from one of the most pedastaled posters on TRP. This is the underlying mentality  the defeatist mentality and the inability to surmount challenge. If you cant handle energy draining challenges in your daytoday personal life how does that translate into your professional life?The truth of the matter is this. Women can drain energy. Women can also give energy if they so choose. Every single man both here and on TRP knows this why else would they spin so many plates. Theyre right  its absolutely easier to next a girl and start from scratch. Ask enough women and youll find someone. And yes you will get that rush of adrenaline from the chase and conquest. Just find another woman whos willing to fuck you and leech the energy and value out of. The challenge with being married is being able to teach and to have the fortitude to expect that constant positive energy so that person is someone who is always adding value to your life  someone who cares enough to constantly do her best to satisfy you in ways that you dont even think of yourself. Where you get to the point that you put in minimal energy and get out maximum value. The satisfaction that you feel knowing that for at least one person you are their world and youre willing to be selfless instead selfish.,marriedredpill,cpc7428,6,t5_32dvh

It sounds like she is just very clear about the alphabeta balance she likes. Instead of trying to change her why dont you listen to her actions and fine tune your balance?If she is repeatedly shit testing in sex it means you arent passing the tests and she is giving you another chance. To me it all sounds like she is asking for more alpha. Ramp it up in a way she understands. Again finish MMSLP and NMMNG.

3447676,0,t3_2zphek,Well definitely I echo that your wife shouldnt be writing the script on how to handle your parents. And with them though youre still dancing a lot to their tune.Stop and assume your parents will only ever act like they do now and forever. You cant change them  only manage  your interactions with them. So with that in mind you can A just cut all contact. People do it. You could do it slow fade style if it makes you feel better.B Im assuming they stay with you when they visit. Make that a no go anymore. If they want to visit they need to find a hotel they can afford and for gods sake dont be their chauffeur. While they are here its planned interactions only. No coming over and hanging out at your house with no time frame end  in site. Id also really scale back their visits to once a year to biyearly if you can swing it again just make it impossible  get creative if you cant get assertive...although that would be the best way as itll make a statement as well.But I mean you left your home country because you were trying to get away from them. Why not just flat out tell them you need x years off from them to really evaluate what type of interaction youll have in the future?gt do I have stake in this game? How your kid grows up in regards to religion? How is this a question? Why are you not? If the only reason youre baptizing your kid is to appease your parents... again why? Do you let them tell you what to feed them or how to clothe them? Just tell them you did already if you want to shut them up and cant for whatever reason bring yourself to tell them youre not going to do it. BUT if its important to YOU and your wife and youre religious then baptize them. my own extra confusion I guess is that I understand the religiously devout and dogmatic over the wishy washy and Im a total antiorganized religion stick in the mud. Theyre your kids and your responsibility. Dont hand that over to someone else. Good luck keep on MAPPing. ,marriedredpill,cpl9ez3,1,t5_32dvh

3470176,0,t1_cpntegt,That is a good way to enforce it then. If you want her to change her behavior consistently do this after some signal. For example if you want her to toss the phone away when you come to bed do this consistently when you come to bed. Not only before sex but always. With time and consistency she will learn to put it away. But dont expect quick changes. Behavioral modification takes time so be outcome independent by not focusing on her learning but by focusing on you consistently enforcing this. Dont be upset that she isnt learning but be happy that you are getting her to stop the phone with your actions. That is the success goal.Uncouple the phone issue from the sex issue and address them separately. It will take time but it is a lot more effective that way.,marriedredpill,cpntpf0,1,t5_32dvh
3480607,0,t1_cpooogx,Mini rant  Youve got ten years on me but Im a little confused.  Heavy lifting is a relative term.  Given adequate recovery time which does increase with age good form and modesty in setting goals  planning the program this is huge for me I dont see how lifting would be fundamentally damaging to the body i.e. unsustainable.  The vast majority of people are never going to be throwing up a lb squat or lb deadlift.  Surely there must be lifting programs that are sustainable for seniors...at least I hope so.  I thought a key element in preventing osteoporosis was resistance training.  At  which person is going to be sprier the one who does calisthenics or the one who has a solid squat with good form?  I think we are far more able to maintain robust strength as we age than most would assume.  And I believe a lot of our issues come from our shitty stworld chemicalladen stressridden sedentary patterns of living multiplied times decades  trashed congested liver no longer able to supply proper nutrients for recovery to tissues downstream.  And which tissues are MOST downstream lowest on the totem pole in terms of economics of tissue maintenance?  Joint cartilage and ligaments and tendons...precisely what limits the elderlys mobility most.I have seen some pretty jacked guys in their s who clearly still lift.  I dont know how heavy but they have to still be lifting.All that said in the end I have to defer partially to your experience.  Maybe in  years Ill look back and think Jeez I was a clueless ass.  For now I am still expecting to maintain a robust physical frame as I age.,marriedredpill,cpp0it3,1,t5_32dvh

Why do women get preferential treatment? Why is it always expected that I treat women better? Just stick to that for now as it wok have the most impact on his current circumstances.

You want to take yourself seriously but not at the expense of having others opinion of you change and you are worried that you cant be who your woman wants you to be?!?!Be Yourself try to be the best version of you that you possibly can be. If your lady doesnt like you for who you really are instead of the you that everyone else wants you to be then she isnt worth your time.Yes its uncomfortable realizing everything you thought you knew about success and living an optimal life is a lie  So What??You have to start doing what is right and what is true. Remove the facade of being A nice guy because if you are being yourself then whatever labels come to you will be earnest ones.People think Im nice because I dont try to be anything. Im nice because I help people out dont bitch or gossip and tell it how it is directly to the person. I do these things because I want to not because Im looking to get anything from it. Direct confrontation may seem to you to be a negative but its the oppositeYou have made some improvements already keep your foot on the gas and start taking charge of life and responsibility for where you are and where you arent.If you want to write a bookcomplete a projectcompete in a competition then you need to make those things happen and not expect it to just occur because you want it to.Read more of the sidebar and the recommended blogs and realize there is more to TRP than the external Alpha Growth.

Because if you act like their child the last thing they want to do is fuck you.In contrast if you listen to Archwinger take initiative solve problems BEFORE your wife notices them and act as the leader who assigns tasks and sets the overall goal then guess what?

Thats not completely true but its was partly selfdread if you like. What it meant was that I had to nail my parts in rehearsal to the point where I could play the songs through without error multiple times in a row because if I just practiced to where I did it well once as soon as I was onstage in front of people it would be a struggle. There would be mistakes. Id feel bad for sucking. This is what is happening in your marriage. Your home life sucks. Thats your rehearsal. Once you go out and about where there are other people it gets even harder. So you need to focus on your rehearsal home life not the performance public interactions. You dont sound boring. You sound like you have a wife who doesnt respect you. I can tell you with  certainty that in your situation my wife would have moved closer to me and frowned at the other guys. How your wife acted was a bad sign but hopefully youll move through this stage. Youre still new to this so you see signs in all kinds of places.

As I am immersed in my reality and really starting to look at things as they are I am starting to think she is just a shitty person. Heck even my five year old daughter thinks I am happier than my wife is.If you are ever angry about how you were before RP and then follow up with I might as well get divorced... its easier then you shouldnt get divorced.  You are still in the anger stage of unplugging and divorce motivated by anger makes your decision a product of her energy and not yours and makes you get angrier as the divorce proceeds.gt So the wife hit me with cold and distant yesterday when I got home from work. Not sure where that came from.I maintain this line of thinking at all timesShe is having a feeling and there is nothing you can do about that.  I or something else caused the feeling and there is nothing I can do about that.  Her feelings are her feelings and if she wishes to share them she may.  If she wishes to not she may not.Long and the short of it is if shes being cold and distant go about your day.  Do your own thing.  Dont be cold dont be distant just be.  You can hold out against her feelings longer than she can... theyre not your feelings theyre hers.she may get mad because you arent interested in her feelings.  You have nothing to apologize for... you havent done anything.  Your feelings are your responsibility and hers are hers.If she becomes shitty then you become cold and distant separate yourself from her completely until she stops being shitty.  She has to come to you remember you were neutral in all this.  She initiated her own actions based on her feelings.  You simply existed in spite of them.  She wants nothing more than to crab bucket you with her feelings to make you feel guilty for not having the same feelings.Women on feelings are like children.  This morning my  yo daughter didnt want to go to school.  I said cmon... lets go.  She just stood there I dont want to.  I grabbed her things and walked to my car bye.

She would never admit her motivation shit she may not even know it but she works out hard and will diet hard to keep up with me.  When I start to slack she does too and encourages more slacking on my part.  When I reject the temptation and get back on the ball she immediately does as well.Now talking to her I honestly would never be able to figure out what is driving her its very well disguised.  But just watching the actions and remembering what Ive learned via TRP its easily discernible that she wants me to slack so she can feel secure enough to slack as well.

4049427,0,t3_36saax,Completely agree with this.I started eating paleostyle back in  and it completely changed my life.  I lost about  lbs over the following  months going from a size  down to a size .  My acid reflux went away and what I thought was some sort of chronic sinusitis was actually an allergy to wheat and cow dairy.  My energy level also stayed constant throughout the day.  I also no longer got lightheaded if I went more than two hours without eating.But the most surprising thing was how it affected my emotional stability.  I had struggled with anxiety most of my life particularly in social situations but I would also go through periods of time where it was a more chronic generalized anxiety.  I would periodically feel depressed.  I would also often break down crying if my wife said something to me that hurt my feelings or even if she was unfairly angry with me.  It was pathetic.Once I cut out the foods that played havoc with my blood sugar levels I discovered this calmness and emotional stability that I never knew existed before.  I had come across MMSL earlier that year but it wasnt until this point in time that I was finally able to really start putting that advice into practice.  Without that emotional stability I found it nearly impossible to stand my ground and push back when I needed to.I truly believe that diet and lifting are the two most essential pillars of a MAP or whatever we call it here on this reddit.  And I think that diet provides the foundation for lifting.  When I stick with a paleoinspired diet and Im lifting x per week everything else comes so much more naturally.  ,marriedredpill,crhv6nf,1,t5_32dvh

I pull back but she doesnt let go and I dont want to break the iPad so I grab a wrist to pry it off the iPad. She punches me in the temple with her other hand knuckles not a slap. I cant get up and move away without pushing her and I cant push her without sending her over the table so I throw an arm around her head and pull her in so she cant punch me again. She tries to scratch me but cant through my shirt so she pinches me full force  and it is only a matter of time before she finds bare skin and draws blood it wouldnt be the first time  shes one of those girls who has internalized men dont hit women to the degree they think they can just go batshit crazy without risk . So I do a koshi guruma slow throw on her so she lands on the sofa in front of me and I can grab hold of both wrists. Shes still struggling like crazy and I dont want her to get bruises or bite me so I drag her up and push her away.

This is a first ever for me.Now to address your reply to megt she has low self esteem low empathy and a temperThose all also happen to be the main foundation of BPD. gt  other than that she seems solid. Other than that Mrs. Lincoln how did you like the show?gt She was a total straight arrow getting her education great grades shes acing it with her career and never quits no matter what they throw at her. Does tons of stuff for her kids takes care of her appearance shes careful with money her friendships are undramaticThere is high functioning BPDs out there. Not every single case of BPD has the extreme reactions like cutting suicide attempts etc... High functioning BPDs actually do quite well at work school and externally. The rage attacks can and do get directed inwards. The DSM only calls for any five of the nine diagnostic criteria to be met. There is no requirement that the more common behavior seen in BPDs be present as well.gt she doesnt try to control me etc. Her problem is more that she tries to work herself half to death than shes flaky.Doesnt try to control you? She fucking violently assaulted you for no good reason knowing full well you strength and martial arts background. What about sex? You just said thisgt I went up to the bedroom and said it was sexy she was becoming like this. She said she was always like this but I hadnt been into it. Shes hamstering her AFBB strategy. Bottom line is she totally picked me for my money back when we met.She is controlling you with sex. You started alluding to the fact that you are aware of your SMV she thinks she is going to lose you and completely flips out. Realizing that she can no longer control you with the IV drip of sex she now starts to pull out the big guns. This is classic controlling behavior.gtI honestly think I was the one being provocative. I told her she was bitching about inconsequential things and that was true but it was important to her. And then I put in my earphones and went back to watching my show. Im not saying I was wrong but that would piss anyone off greatly.Its not your behavior that is the red flag it is the completely out of proportion response from her. Ill say it again normal healthy women Ha! I made a funny! do not attack men like this. gt Theres a good chance I blew a comfort test and I should have hugged her instead.You said earlier she was close to ovulation. Archwinger wrote about shit tests and comfort tests here. His theory is that shit tests happen preovulation and comfort tests happen postovulation  PMS. I havent found anyone else peg it so distinctly like that but the theory makes sense to me. This was not a comfort test from her this was not a shit test. This was a fucking batshit crazy out of control emotional outburst from her. I have read a lot about shit tests vs. comfort tests and never have I found a report of either one resulting in an allout assault.gt but I wouldnt say that is a sign of a psychiatric disorder. BPD is a cluster B personality disorder. It is not a chemical imbalance or something with the brains neurons not firing properly. A personality disorder is based on learned behavior. You are not dealing with bipolar schizophrenia or anything like that. You are dealing with someone who has no idea that they cannot properly manage their emotional state.

You are doing some serious hamstering there. You need to spend some time reflecting on your situation my friend.Edit I just reread your replies to ujacktenofheartsgt She blew up like this once before years ago smashed a glass tossed a laptop tried to tip over a bookcase.gt Ive been dead bedroom frustrated had the wife insult me hard lost my cool and still only took it out on inanimate stuff.

4502794,0,t1_csy835n,I dont find value in ab isolation the movements are not natural and dont really play into weight lift movements.    The only ab exercises I would endorse would be hanging leg raises and abwheels.  HLRs force the abs to work against the legs and support weight in a natural way liting ones legs is a normal movement.  Abwheels contract the abs on the concentric wheel towards legs but force it to maintain contraction on the eccentric wheel away from legs movement to keep the body stable.  This is also a very natural use of the abdominals.    Outside of that Squats and deadlifts tend to incorporate the abs in very natural and functional ways.    Everything else wont hurt you but I cant say they help much either.    As for ab size... why?  These arent muscles that become more useful with hypertrophy the size would hinder full range of motion.. I wont tell you what you find value in but I would focus on hypertrophy for the large muscle groups and focus on strength for the abs and the big  or big  if you do BB rows.    Personal anecdote my abs have never been stronger than when I was doing BJJ  times a week.  I cant wait to get back to it!,marriedredpill,csy8a1l,1,t5_32dvh

Whether it involve some guy not reading enough side bar material or not internalizing the pill whatever it may be Im kinda stumped why no one has torn into this post.Who gives a shit about your wife making a big deal about an unattainable movie star?  A few people have mentioned you were too reactive to the situation instead of taking control from jump street of which I agree.  However it is deeper than that why do you give a shit about your wife gushing over a movie star?  Why does it bother you at all?  Wheres your confidence?  It feels like a covert contract to me.  Shes not supposed to be attracted to other men.  Bullshit.  She came home and wanted to fuck and it seems like your response was passive aggressive in nature.  I came quickly without worrying about getting her off first  While there is not anything intrinsically wrong with this at all you point out that you usually want round .  You were obviously butt hurt to some extent over the movie hence the post in the first place.Im no MRP guru but make sure you are being completely honest with yourself and us.  Even your  possible responses are still passive aggressive.  Fuck that movie man own your shit.  She is still coming home to you to fuck.  You missed some opportunities to be the man at that dinner you could have had a shit load of fun with the whole situation.  Instead you let a shitty movie affect your  mood and your relationship.  You cant negotiate desire.  If your wife doesnt go to the second viewing does it mean she wont still be drooling over the actor?  Someone jump in here if Im out of line.

4586050,0,t3_3dt3fh,First of all I enjoyed Athols book but his sex tips are ridiculous. I mean letting yourself getting caught while penetrating yourself with an anal dildo? Really? I like that he explained womens cycles and body chemistry in easy to understand terms and the idea to make yourself a plan with an actual time line is also a great idea.Im guessing you already have been to rdeadbedrooms? Im going to be completely honest with you. Im married for  years so I know what Im talking about. Dont expect to EVER turn this thing around . And the moment you start letting yourself go again you will be at the beginning where you was. She sees you as a father for her children not as her husband. If you have already reached that point you will not be able to reverse it. All you can do is to get a little bit more sex with a lot of psychological and physical work. Its up to you to decide if its worth it.First of all. Make an appointment with your lawyer if you dont have one search one and talk with him what could go bad after and during divorce depending on where you live and your local law A LOT! Im in Germany for example and since  a women can nullify a prenup just by saying that it doesnt feel equal. For the Germans that not believe me Der Ehevertrag darf berdies die Unterhaltspflichten nicht so verteilen dass damit das Kindeswohl gefhrdet ist oder die Vereinbarung den Staat als Trger der sozialen Transfersysteme ber Gebhr belastet. Ebenso knnen Ehevertrge problematisch sein bei denen ein Unterhaltsausschluss zu einer unangemessenen einseitigen Benachteiligung des wirtschaftlich schwcheren Partners z.B. aufgrund von mglicher ehebedingter Nachteile fhrt. Ehebedingte Nachteile knnen vorliegen wenn es aufgrund der Lebensgestaltung des wirtschaftlich schwcheren Partners whrend der Ehe zu uneinholbaren Gehaltseinbuen gekommen ist. Dabei unterliegt die Feststellung des Bestehens ehebedingter Nachteile lediglich einer sekundren Darlegungs und Beweislast und hat damit einen spekulativen Anteil.gt source  .Im quoting two posts that were posted here and I saved to my notepad. I hope that the original content providers arent mad at me for essentially stealing their postsTry to sleep with her. The moment she say something like Really how important is it that this happens tonight? Response It isnt. Roll over.Next morning start the process of improving yourself by beggining  day a week lifting workout schedule new wardrobe better diet and sleep habits good haircut teeth whiteners etc.Also immediately stop it with the scented candles routines no more The Talks long massages favorite dinners etc. You are the one investing in this relationship not her. And you are now wondering why you get so little in return. You have taught her that sex is not important in a relationship via your ongoing actions and continued commitment in the face of her physical withdrawal.Real world results tend to speak louder than words. So all your talks with her are pushing back on the much stronger message reality is giving her. She gets her relationship cookie of love and affection dispensed by you all the time despite you never getting the sexaul cookie you seek. So she naturally assumes there is no real link between those two.Societys message to LL partners of it is just sex and everyone slows down in a relationship only serves to make her position feel both normal and somehow more refined.Dont try to fight all that now with words. Instead spend the next  months reclaiming yourself as an independent person who has options in life. During that time do not think of her as a sexual person. This should not be all that hard depending on how dead the bedroom is.Just focus on looking at her the way she looks at you. She is a roommate and person with whom you had a love affair in the past. But now you are sharing expenses and enjoying each others company in a primarily social platonic way.Make that effort to fight back against your brain seeing her as a dispensary of sexual cookies. Fight against your trained response to hit that bar so many times hoping for the cookie to drop! At some pointsome say it comes like a CRACK! other say it is a process over timeyou will see her not as your source of sexual pleasure. You will see her as a woman who lives with you. You will see her like she sees you.Then once your head is cleared of your current conditioned response of being a Pavlovianworkedover chimp desperately hitting the pellet bar for the occasional sexual cookie you can decide whether to stay go fix outsource or whatever.Realize that your women is not and should not be your only source for happiness. Her is a ten step recipe to being happy by Alejandro Jodorowsky. When in doubt between doing and not doing choose doing. If youre wrong at least youll have the experience.. Listen to your intuition more than your reason. Words forge reality but they are not it.. Make some childish dream of yours come true. For example if you wanted to play but were forced to become an adult before your time save some  euros and go play them at a casino until you lose it. If you win keep playing. If you keep winning even if its millions continue until you lose it all. Its not about winning but about playing with no end.. There is no greater relief than to start becoming what one is. Since childhood were coerced into other peoples destinies. We are not in this world to pursue the dreams of our parents but our own. If youre a singer and not an attorney like your father abandon your law career and record your album.. Stop criticizing your body right now. Accept it as it is without concerning yourself with the stares of others. Youre not loved because youre beautiful. Youre beautiful because youre loved.. Once a week teach others the little or lot that you know. What you give to them you give to yourself. What you dont give to them you take away from yourself.. Every day look for a positive story in the newspaper. Its difficult to find one. But amid all the atrocities somehow there always is one. A new species of bird was discovered comets transport life a boy who fell from the top of a five story building landed unharmed the daughter of a president intent on drowning herself was saved by a laborer with whom she fell in love and married young Chilean poets bombarded the palace of La Moneda where Allende was assassinated with  poems from a helicopter etc.. If your parents abused you when you were a child calmly confront them in a neutral place that is not their territory developing four aspects This is what they did to me. This is what I felt. This is what because of that I now suffer. And this is the reparation that I ask. Forgiveness without reparation has no use.. Even if you have a large family assign yourself a personal territory where no one may enter without your permission.. Stop defining yourself allow yourself every possibility that could be and change paths as often as necessary.Failing does not exist. With each failure we change paths. To arrive at what you are you must go through what you are not. The greatest happiness is to become what you are. In every sickness there is A prohibition You are prohibited from being what you are. A lack of consciousness When you dont realize what you are. A lack of beauty When you lose beauty you become ill. Good luck ShuffleUp.

It doesnt succeed as often as Id like but at least the act of assertion builds my confidence. I also dont lose my shit anymore. Used to be when faced with too much work Id spaz out. This would put everyone else on edge too. I dont do that anymore. Partly this is because I dont really give a shit about the events at work.

If you admit to her that you are stressed out or whatever you are admitting to her that your emotions have taken over you and you are not man enough to handle it. If you want her to help you out use her to fuck or suck the stress out of you. If you want to actually talk about whats stressing you out grab a drink with another male friend.

Again you should always be incorporating things from uBluepillProfessor s post. Read it.ampnbspNote You want just enough food Dread for the hamster to chew on without making her outright jealous. Her hamster needs time to process the Dread and too much jealously stirs up an emotional response which defeats the purpose of Dread in many cases. ampnbspSome Examples. lifting why because fit alphas can always fuck a hottie. calling the cute waitress by her name while you are at dinner together but not being overtly flirtatious with her why hearing another girls name coming out of your mouth  confidence that you can talk to women. AampA anytime she mentions getting oldother girls... yep all the hotties on the cheerleading squad would be all over me why confidence and cockiness. any situation where she can see you in a casual conversation with a good looking woman why you are not a bumbling idiot that would be lost without her. at the beach... opportunity for her to see other women looking at you why assuming you lift... she will notice when other women notice. having your own hobbieslife outside of the marriage . if she talks about her friends and their shitty marriages you can elude to the fact that they need to fix it or they should definitely divorce... marriage should be fun why this lets her know that you think divorce IS an option but its under the radar since its not about your relationship. if she ever mentions a cute chick checking you out... agree that you are hot enough to merit the attention while simultaneously telling her that you only want her and that fat ass of hers why this shows confidencecockiness and also diffuses a comfort testampnbspI am sure others will opine on the subject of Dread but this should give you some insight.

A few things Im trying to figure out here.gt I had planned to leave if this happened Lay down some dread. I had previously got up and left about a month ago after a rejection and went upstairs and watched TV. Hamster spinning a little but not much.Leaving to watch TV in the house isnt dread your driveway is a better one. But the fact you dont have something awesome to go do instead would be something worth working on.gt  I cam back in and she was sound asleep not sure how I feel about thatI may be wrong but this sounds like a covert contract. If I leave the house and apply dread you will sit here and worry about your marriage.gt If she wants out I can live with thatI read twice couldnt find anywhere she signals that to you. I get the impression she figures she can ropeadope you while you punch yourself out then business as usual.I see the fuck me or fuck you speech. means you are Dread level . I cant tell if youve gone past  previously. Have you gone through them one by one or have you just hit the gym then went to ?Either way if youre getting your shit together like you say in shape flirting with others dressing nice and leading PUA on others subtle signalling of your needs then really theres only two steps left divorce or get a GF on the side.Im guessing youre not as far along as you think though still have some covert contracts no true OI and the victim puke worked against you but you already know this and have problems with STFU.Either way how committed are you? Is divorce on the table? those steps shes taken to work on a LL if its not you are sincere? Youve been working out are there signs of success? Would a single girl jump you?Theres a lot of details but it doesnt look like youre taking it outside and getting feedback but just doing them like they are inherent pussy wetteners instead of ways to secure quality women that you still have to go out and approach.Based on what Ive read and how I would move forward Id just go start picking up women. you say youre super christian so catchandrelease if youre afraid of zombie jesus.

After so many years of nice guy beta bitch behavior I think I would have crashed and burned without the protection and time for self reflection that my ego provided for me but it has to stop.My self confidence is low.  I am recognizing it in my behavior now.  It has been a long road here.  This affects my ability to be dominant and pass shit tests.  With meditation work this WILL get better.Where I AM NowI have been going thru the  stages of grief from the loss of the old and familiar as I can never go back and am driven to go forward .First grief stage denial that my snowflake wasnt so perfect.  Then stage anger and stage bargaining at the same time.  For me the anger and bargaining was being unable to STFU but reasoning and arguing with the snowflake.  All the while my ego was protecting me and interfering with my progress.Now at stage depression I sometimes feel like I fell in a deep black hole of hopelessness.  Then an hour later feel proud of my progress on my path.  Having off and on ED problems.  The last time I fell in a hopeless hole like this was after both my parents died the same year.

5456535,0,t3_3psp9x,gt If you do  then I will  unspokenThis is not a covert contract this is conditioning. Its providing feedback for another persons behavior the feedback could be either a reward or a punishment. A reward provided by another person is not possible with a covert contract.Covert contracts provide reinforcement on your own behavior in a way that in reality can only provide punishment. i.e. suppose you think if I clean the kitchen then I will get enthusiastic sex. You cannot actually provide this reward system at all. Your sex partner cannot provide this reward system either because its covert. So the behavior you actually learn is if I clean the kitchen then I will not get enthusiastic sex. This leads to resentment. You trick yourself into thinking you can be rewarded but in reality you can only possibly receive punishment. There is no way to win with covert contracts this is why they are toxic. Now if instead you negotiate with your sex partner if I clean the kitchen then I will get enthusiastic sex and everyone agrees to the overt contract then if you hold up your end of the contract it is entirely reasonable to expect the reward.Try to imagine a dog using covert contracts to get a very specific treat from his owner and how exactly you would expect that to work. The dog wants a tbone so it rolls over but you just give it a chew toy if you notice at all. You didnt live up to your end of the covert contract so the dog gets agitated. How the hell are you supposed to know whats going on? It makes no sense. Similarly you cant just give a dog a treat and then expect the dog to do something it doesnt know or want to do.TLDR Both covert and overt conditioning will work. Contracts can only provide rewards via negotiation. Covert contracts cannot be negotiated this means covert contracts can only punish.,marriedredpill,cw94h2h,8,t5_32dvh

Remember that woman will only tell you what they feel you must know. I managed to find out because i found the Pill and she had a slip of the tongue. She made me believe what I wanted to believe for a Decade mate. It was not her fault AWALT she needed to lock me down because if i found out about her past I would never have married her. However it is what it is..If doing what you are doing is making you happy continue however understand that if you do not get the type of woman you dream about if she lies to you and you find out It will fuck you up. I am speaking from personal experience you will regret every decision to stay celibate and it will haunt you until you let it go.

Translation If I tell you I dont love him before he tells you he doesnt love me then I risk your judgement. Im the Good Guy here. The person that files thats the Bad Guy.In her mind if she gets you to file shes the Good Guy. So now her goal is to get you to file. gt She has just had her salary deposited to a separate account this morning and she wants to know what all the expenses are so she will deposit funds to the joint account.She has divorced friends. At the very least theyre showing her pages from the divorce playbook. I dont think she has a lawyer yet. Ill speak to that further below.gt She told me she wanted to shock me.Someone told her to do this to shock you into taking emotional action....aaaaaand she came right out and said this to your face. Your wife isnt the sharpest knife in the drawer isnt she? At this stage this is a good thing.gt She has not cheated on me to my knowledge and for me that is a deal breaker. Of course she hasnt cheated on you! She told you that you two were done over six months ago. In her mind thats when you two separated. Its not cheating if she is separated. I mean were not legally separated but thats a technicality that will be rectified when he finally files the papers. He just sat on his ass for six months after we had The Talk. Im a good person dont judge me.gt  All she does is lash out at me and the kids. Enforce your personal boundaries and protect your children. You and your wife are your childrens protectors. Shes forgotten that which is another indicator that shes having an affair so you also need to protect them from her. Dont get physical be in control of your emotions and dont raise your voice. Show your children that you are their shield.gt How do I act around her? Calm and in control of yourself. Cheerful for yourself and your children. Dont try to cheer her up or talk about your feelz she has lost all respect for you and will only view any overtures as supplication from a position of fear.gt What do I say?About what? About the divorce? Ask open ended questions and be noncommittal to any of her queries. Get information from her dont give any back unless your lawyer tells you its OK.Nothing until youve retained a lawyer. gt I want to ask for my engagement ring and wedding band back after years.Thats butthurt feelz. You want to lash out and hurt her for hurting you. She wont be hurt by your request. Shell be angered that you had the temerity to demand them back and after she talks to her divorced clique shell know to use them as a bargaining chip in the proceedings.Hire that lawyer and follow her advice to the letter. Im going to guess that shell want you to file as soon as possible. Its also very likely that the lawyer is going to tell you to get a new job with daytime hours that has comparable pay to your existing one. This will be very important for positioning yourself in the custody battle. Right now your wife just wants you gone. She thinks so little of you that she cant conceive of you doing anything other than slinking away into the ether. Her fantasy bolstered by her divorced friends has you being grateful for whatever scraps of time you get with your children and paying her alimony. All of her friends are getting it why wouldnt she? I dont think she has a lawyer yet. If she did shed have the same numbers that you do and shed be following a totally different gameplan. Shed either be setting you up for abuse charges or more likely riding your ass hourly to get a better paying job that would eliminate her alimony payments.Im giving you the divorce advice because I think she cheated on you. I know you or I dont have all of the information but what youve given me fits the pattern well enough.After you file shes probably going to do her damnedest to get you to move out of the house. If she cant shell move out.If she moves out its most likely that shell move in with one of her divorced friends.Failing that if her cheating partner is single and if heshe allows her to move in with him shell announce that shes moving out because ltinsert manufactured bullshit reasongt and has found a new apartment with a roommate that happens to be the sex of whomever her partner is.If she moves in with her divorced friend or cant move out shell wait the obligatory Im not a cheating whore month before she officially starts dating again. And guess what? Shell find twue love right off of the bat... with whomever shes been fucking for the last six months.Request As events progress please let me know where Im right or where Im wrong in my advice and predictions.

Im still a bit sleep deprived but that will clear up naturally as long as I keep sleeping well. Shit Im working onNutrition. Honestly I give in to my wife too much on this one. Im trying to lose fat so Im doing lower carbs than usual though not keto. Shes sort of on board in theory at least but she always wants carbs and I give in more often than I should. I can improve this by cooking at home more. Im a great cook and if Im the one cooking which is the case  of the time she doesnt get a say.Work. Im back to working in my home office after having spent almost two weeks at the actual office which is in another country.

I remember when I first discovered RP with the  commandments of poon and I made fun of it for days. Then I read a bunch of stuff and it made me angry because obviously I was NAWALT duh! Then one day after reading RP for a couple of weeks basically hatereading it LOL I cant remember what I read but it was probably on Roissy everything suddenly clicked. I was like that. It freaked me out massively when I saw myself in the things those men wrote. I had dreaded myself!It scared the crap out of me you know that horrible sinking feeling when you realize you just screwed up massively? Yep I was deep into that. I started applying RP to my marriage and my husband looked sideways at me a lot who was I and what had I done with his harpy shrew wife?Right now she is probably choking on the pill because it is a huge chalky pill and doesnt go down well especially with women but some day it will happen hopefully and something will click. She is going through the stages of grief right now I can see it in everything you write. She is fighting it but little things are getting through during this fight.The reason I think that it is harder for women to swallow is because women have to change much more than men. They have to learn to STFU when they want to criticize and men only need to stand up for themselves. Since womens frame is talk and mens frame is action men only need to go back to what they were to begin with and take action but women have to fight their nature to talk talk talk their way into getting the outcome they want. They have to learn to not talk bitch their man into submission. They have to learn that they broke their alpha and now need to back off and let him fix himself.,marriedredpill,cy8vgoo,24,t5_32dvh

You cant undue all your beta overnight so dont try.Women shit test that is just what they do. Your wife shouldnt shit test you more because you took the pill. If you think she is and you just took the pill yesterday you need to slow down. Youve read some pages on the internet. Your wife shouldnt be telling you that you are acting weird.

In your shoes Id reach out to my friends that live in another city and ask if theyre up for a visitor for the weekend. Make a little road trip out of it. Bring a notebook make some stops along the way jot some thoughts down. Go on kickass torrents and download all my favorite albums from  listen to them all on the drive. Stop at a diner eat at a counter watch the people there youll never see again and marvel at just how fucking beautifully insignificant our existence is. Hang out with your buddy go to a dive bar throw a couple brews back and rant about your whore of a wife. Feel free to uses phrases like that fucking bitch why even pretend to try and earn back my trust and do something like this? What the fuck was the point? Is she some fucking sadist? Puke your emotions out at the bar then puke your guts out in the bathroom. Keep in touch with your kids if theyre old enough to talk on the phone etc. You can let your wife know youre still alive and thats it. Thank him and his wife the next morning for letting you crash then go get a greasy omelette somewhere. Get back in your car enjoy the drive back. Allow a sense of renewed purpose to wash over you. Any good thoughts that occur to you pull over and jot them in your notebook. Whats the rush? The whole point of this is perspective. You are at point A. You know A sucks. You know there is some theoretical point B out there you want to go to but you literally dont even know what it looks like where it is and how you would get there. How can you? Point A is a quicksand of turds and doesnt give a great vantage point. When you get home you will still be at point A but you should hopefully have a birds eye perspective. Your frame literally will come down to how will you maintain this perspective. Every morning you wake up literally pretend you are a bird in your bedroom then imagine flying out the window and circling around in wider and higher circles. Your backyard your street your town... Just do a stupid little mental exercise every day you wake up or when you take a shower. The reason for all this hippie shit is because you are clearly feeling like your marriage equity is in default despite all the payments youve made over the years. The balance added up to  to your wife. Youve been on MRP long enough that rationally you know theres no point whining about it. But it still is fucking emotionally enraging right? Right.

But OP is only as strong as his weakest link and being overly reactive to tears is one of those.gt the part that I see is where he seems to be doing this to change her into what he thinks he wants. Ahh... in line with your mental models solid post btw.  gt OP isnt talking about what he wantsGood insight. On rereading the original post with this in mind I see a lot of describing the struggle the tactics and the countertactics but very little of the why.

6397496,0,t3_4397ug,As a guy who was married and didnt work out what all the issues were in his first marriage i.e. all the things I fucked up on and didnt take responsibility for before embarking on his second Id advise you OP to work on yourself. Improve yourself you work on you. Your GF will either work herself into the life you create for you or she wont. Make damn sure you know what YOU want or you will  end up in the same place as your first marriage. Honestly how she is with you now BEFORE you are married is the best shes going to be. If that doesnt work out for what you want in a LTR then dont get married again to her and seriously reconsider if you want to be in a LTR with this woman. Going out a little bit on a limb Id bet that this is your first serious GF since your divorce and that it really hasnt been that long since your marriage was over. If you work on yourself and are happy with your vision and the life you have created for YOU then youll know if shes good first mate material or not. ,marriedredpill,czgtvf0,1,t5_32dvh

A sure way to Fuck the child up.It IS important however to encourage children to try new things and even push them when  where they need it. But if they dont like it they can do something else.Children need to be shown to be tolerant and understanding but not weak and easily intimidated.Children need to be taught to do things because they want to do them not to get approval from others.Children need to be taught to be moral and truthful not selfish and deceitful.Do this and your kids will be rock stars I have  adult rock stars ,marriedredpill,d05a22m,0,t5_32dvh

She finally came down after  minutes and gave me a light hearted ribbing you never came up to say hi?!. etc.. I just gave her a kiss and kept on making dinner.

Will not be allowed to do contact martial arts ever again. The surgery is a benchmark for me physically mentally  emotionally and is also a timeline I had set for improve or next in my life marriage.   We will see how that gets handled. Shit I OwnNearly everything else. Career is good friends are improving. I have a social life outside of work. I get uninvited  at least not overtly invited flirting from women in my punching weight which I am fine with.  Interesting enough all of them are taken in some way. These changes have all been from mostly a mental paradigm shift. Some of the office girls have had to reassure their SOs that I am married.  Not entirely sure what that means or whether I should care. Shit that will need owningFiguring out a financial strategy after probably june.  Figuring out a workout plan for when I am back on my feet post surgically. I am still a curved back fuck but now I am a curved back fuck with a smile great clothes better shape and day game that works on everyone but the wife.

With his mothers situation he needs to remain focused more than ever on embracing the moments he has.For OP think of your mothers death every morning then dial yourself back in and remember she is here.

My daughter is  she is in dance and is doing soccer this year. My son  is doing football and baseball.

Im down with supersets its kinda what CrossFit is anyway and the faster I can be in amp out of the gym and still pushit the more time for other stuff. One of my favorites is back squats supersetted with Lpullups on the back squat bar when its racked. Being closer to the ground at the bottom of the pullup makes you keep your feet higher and makes it harder to cheat the Lsit. Good grueling stuff.

7495093,0,t3_4hx55e,gtwhether or not MRP mods think getting married is a good idea.Im not a mod but here goes.  Marriage is a bad idea now.  Thats because of several reasons   divorce law child custodyalimony and false rape claims.   the overall state of women as empowered cunty bitches who dont give a shit about anyone but themselves.  The overall condition of men as submissive weak underconfident feminized malepersons who believe that if they just do the Blue Pill thing better theyll actually make it work. The only reason MRP exists is because there were many men who bought into the lies werent formed up correctly andor just didnt get it.  They needed to have someone lay out for them in serial step by step fashion how to adult and how to be a man.   Men who avoided the mainstream feminization messages were formed up correctly with good coping skills and got it dont need to take a Red Pill  they were given a slowly digesting version when they were toddlers.  So by the time they got to meeting girls in their early teens they were good to go.   Just about everyone here fits into one of those categories  You didnt get it as a kid you werent formed up correctly for whatever reason and thus didnt get the messages or you understood it but went Blue Pill because thats what everyone told you to do.  Id venture a speculation that if most of you could go back in time and transport your Red Pill selves to a time before you married you would not have married your wives.   Ill confess  I wouldnt have.  I might  MIGHT have LTRd her.  I would have vetted her much more carefully.  But I wouldnt have signed the paper. I wouldnt have legally married her or anyone else.  Most married men today not just on MRP are weaksauce.   Most married men are married to women they shouldnt have married and who arent right for them and wouldnt have married had they not been Blue Pill at the time.   If my current marriage ends for any reason I will not remarry under any circumstances.  I predict in the coming years that men in LTRs or common law marriages will be treated as married for all intents and purposes.   This will be a marked reversal from legal trends of  to  years ago when common law marriage was abolished in most US states.    The reason   Men are going to be forced to pay one way or another.   Men are not going to be allowed to fuck a woman on the regular without providing her whatever security she claims to be entitled to.   That security will usually be considered as monetary transfers from men to the woman women they fuck whether theyre legally married or not.   So you wont be able to escape ongoing financial obligations to a woman youre fucking just because youre not legally married to her.   If youre in a common law marriage with her youll be treated as married for all intents and purposes and youll be subject to alimony  provisioning.    Bottom line is that I wouldnt recommend marriage or even cohabitating LTRs.   If my current marriage ends I wont remarry under any circumstances.   I also recommend that men who are in failing or failed or DB marriages should divorce if there are no kids.   I see no reason to save such a failed marriage if all there is to do is divvy up property and there are no children.  ,marriedredpill,d2u5hwg,1,t5_32dvh

If you take that as a comment on your character then your ego isnt going to survive his place.    ampnbsp    gt no more initiating from meThen no more sex for you. The burden if seduction is mostly on the guy. Women tend to have responsive desire and theyre also taught to let the guy initiate. Thats just how it works for most couples. So you still have to initiate but you need to learn to do it better. Reaching out from the shower to grab her arm was not a sexy move. Instead of going from nonsexual to initiation always be closing. It gets her in the mood and makes it less likely for you to get butthurt.    ampnbsp    gt Last night she showers off and lays in the bed nakedThats how women initiate when theyre with a clueless guy. I used to be that guy in high school. A girl had to take her shirt off for me to get the hint that she was DTF. Women initiate by showing that theyre receptive to you. Maybe she puts her hand on your chest and subtly slides her hand or fingers around maybe she wears a certain outfit that she wants you to tear off of her body but she wont walk up to you and grab your dick. I guarantee that youre missing out on cues when shes DTF and shes trying to inspire you to initiate.    ampnbsp    As for being a human dildo thats Chad not you.

Modeling good behavior and tough love are fine but you know why your wife and you are broken people. gt I am dealing with an evil that was passed generation through generation.Exactly. The seeds of addiction and personality disorders are sown when you are young. Your past and present mistakes will be their burdens for a long time. Unless you are completely going to write these kids off then dont entertain these ideas. Kill that fucking ego.The fact that youre committed to a stable and healthy environment will be huge to them. The middle one may not even realize it for years and to the youngest this will simply be how things are but they will have  different models for their life ... addiction vs masculinity. You cant choose for them but you can be a rock for those times when they are tempted or torn or fall off the wagon and need to get back on.gt She took my oldest son to hairdresser and my oldest haircut is very similar to that of the new guys. ... She lies to the kids keeps her face straight.Your kids are going to be used as tokens in this battle. For some people its about living through the children easing their own guilt by overcompensating. They try to win by being the best parent... you know Xbox and pizza all the fucking time and force the other one to be boring and responsible. Not for your wife. Shes an addict and a narcissist. If she is locking the kids in at night to party then the only time she will care about the kids is to spite you. You shouldnt dump your frustrations about her on them but you can prepare the oldest to watch out for his brothers and know that they will figure this shit out on their own eventually ngt years.The best thing you could do was to get out of that house. The next best thing you can do is to get your kids out of that house. In the big picture this is as important as anything on your MAP and will probably take just as long. Forget the snatch scenario take your time and gather evidence so that theres no doubt. She seems hellbent on proving to everyone that shes a shitty mother as well as a shitty person and by the time this is over your boys and the courts should see this clearly. It will be hard but trips to see mom will become something they dread  because it hurts to see someone you love fall into that pit. However they will come out the other side stronger for it.tldr  If you still want more kids then have more kids but dont leave your boys to follow the path of addiction or validation seeking.

I worry that your exhortations to stay the course are a version ofgtMan up and take it because it is your duty to stay married soldier.No part of being a credible man is easy. Easy is what petulant children and women naturally pursue. Men with vision and intestinal fortitude harden their minds and bodies by staying in the fire of their choosing. Of their choosing is the instrumental part. So worry not. Im definitely not saying to take shit off anyone but instead Im saying do not allow opposition to strip you of your core values due to desparation.gtI also worry that women have long ago abandoned their duty to fuck Winter soldiers in favor of hot guy sunshine patriots.Correct. As the basic concepts of masculinity have been torn down in modern culture people now falsely believe that the sexier aspects of manliness can be enjoyed a la carte. But just like chronic sugar consumption in the diet of the modern human women will find that immediate wants do not satisfy long term needs. The problem is they dont learn til later with sugar its heart disease or diabetes with dumb hot girls fucking summer soldiers its hitting the wall without a man in sight.gtIf one side insists on virtue and honor and playing by the rules and the other side lies cheats and deflects without honor then honor is not a springboard but a chain.gtYou write like many churchians that women are the almighty value detectors with the almighty and most holy and sacred moist vagina.Again this was true before a self centered convenience culture. The degradation of what masculinity really is has changed how things work. But great men dont do great works just to be appreciated they do it because thats what they are great men.gtHowever it seems we have clearly observed thatgtThe fabled moist vagina Alphalpha detector is nothing but shit and can be fooled easily.Sure it is. Thats not the point. The point is for the sake of yourself is actually be alpha instead of faking alpha. Bitches aint shit but that doesnt mean you cant be the shit anyway.gtThe august and ever pleasing moist vagina Alphalpha detector is more commonly used to zero in on Summer soldiers and Sunshine Patriots not the valuable Winter Warriors you describe.This shit just sounds angry sad and bitter.  gtWinter Warriors get the  detector going but not the moist vagina detector so wha tis the value of smashing your skull against the cement demanding virtue? From a Christian perspective do you really think God designed men and women so that men are forced to serve as Winter Soldiers in a sexless marriage marching off to death or starving at Valley Forge while Chad the Cowardly Summer Patriot nails our wife?Someone sounds embittered by basic selfish human nature. Bitterness is yet a whole other kind of chain. Anger is useless.gtNo thanks.Professor thats perfectly fine just remember about how we teach a balance between comfort and Dread. I feel like the same balance can be struck between ruthless pragmatism and kind benevolence. Not every action we take has to be for the benefit of self theres a bigger mission than that. I surround myself with Winter Soldiers not summer soldiers. I truly believe to not seek out a tribe of Great Men to help you be even a greater man and to focus your your life on gleaning pussy wherever you can is a robbery of oneself. Pussy is momentary and the treasures you build up within yourself last forever.To be fair I didnt end my dead bedroom through tricks and techniques  I did it by not finding my happiness in my wifes approval and in doing so I started doing other stuff and not worrying about her. I learned that selfimprovement and introspection are more valuable to me than even sex. And the second I had things in my life that were more valuable than sex with her then she wanted to be with me because I was a genuine version of myself and thats what she loved about me. Im a Winter Soldier and I pursue the things I believe in and if some summer Soldier moves in on her and she falls for it Ill just find someone else I dont really care because I truly practice stoicism and that coupled with my faith has removed all fucks I have left to give.And I wouldnt be bitter or angry or hold on to it I would take some time to process and move forward into whats next.,marriedredpill,d3uzn5q,2,t5_32dvh

Shes started doing the things I used to do which frees up my bandwidth to do more strategic projects rather than the tactical shit. The vibe I get from her is that shes not doing the chores to please me shes doing them to prove that Im not the only one around here who can do them.

Its been weeks and shes never worn them. ... shes taken a step backward in terms of selfcare and personal presentation.gt Shes in mommymode all the time and youre always out doing fun stuff while shes at home. And when you do take the kids out its probably to something fun as well. I understand that there elements of dread going on but do you think there could be resentment as well?Thats definitely a possibility. Your next question leads right into my answer.gt Let me echo jackten and say Be her escape Ever since I learned from Jack the concept of energizing vs enervating Ive been trying to frame myself as exactly that her escape from Mommy Mode. I havent cracked the code yet and its not going well. Im struggling to rectify the following competing conditions I want to do the things I want to do AKA pursue my passions live my life for me steer my ship drive the bus whatever. Her participation isnt required for me to enjoy my passions. Shes not interested in the leisure activities I do most live music. I explained why here Now despite knowing that I invite her anyway because while I dont NEED her participation I do enjoy sharing my passions with her and others. Im not interested in the things she does for leisure. Could I find something about her activities to enjoy in the moment? Probably but then Id be following not leading and according to the Manosphere and my years of AFC beta life shed resent me for it especially if I prioritized her passion over mine. I am indeed withdrawing my time and attention when she chooses not to ride the bus Ive invited her to board. I recognize that this particular bus isnt going anywhere she wants to go see bullet point  so missing out on the fun probably isnt what shes feeling. So Im trying to figure out how to not compromise my mission by changing course on her direction while taking her someplace she doesnt want to go but not wasting effort convincing her its a reward.The reward I want her to have in her head is spending time with me and receiving my attention but naturally when Im Frowny McDickbag thats punishment not reward. Solution here is to stop being Frowny McDickbag for long enough that I forget who that guy is and so does she. Speaking of that guy...gt Let me quote you to yougtgt I only texted and said Were leaving at  wear a dress.

It was her saturday night to take care of the baby and I wouldnt deny that to her.  I didnt participate and decided instead to visit a neighbor and watch a MMA fight for the night.  I do need to work on being a better leader for the family.   weekends ago I did something similiar I told them to be ready to go for pm.  I packed a cooler some snacks and took them to a drive in which ended up being a really good time.

If that product is made inherently more desirable then our targeted consumers women plural will seek us out.The idea of testing the validity of the desirability of the modifications to the product ourselves by the responses of the consumers women is just a good way to keep our MAP of changes on course.

If you think you can not play at all you will be playing to lose.  I know we want a wife as our partner for life but she is not a partner but a competitor.  MRP gives you the tools to win the competition.gtIn the last  years we have had sex about  times.This makes me breathless with rage.  How can you possibly tolerate this?  How can any woman respect a man who tolerates this?gtI suggested we see a marriage counselor for us to work on issues. Are you serious?  Work on issues like date night and plan ahead for sex.gtShe feels that I should be able to work on my stuff on my own but she feels if its necessary her to go to counselor she would.Because there is NOTHING WRONG with a woman who thinks it is normal to have sex a few times in  years.  No of course not.  She will to counseling for you because nothing could possibly be wrong with her.  Solopsism thy name is woman.gtWe both work together at homeHow is it even possible to work with a woman all day and then see her all night?  If you were in front of me right now I would tell you your best move is to get a job that gets you out of the house.Your second best move is to stop doing this for your wife.  Do it to  be an attractive man.  You can be attractive to women other than your wife.  Once that happens suddenly she will be attracted to you again.Also what Athol Kay May Peace Be Upon Him said  Rule out physical issues.  Are you the Captain who is going to take care of this or are you still going to beg mommy to do something about it?  Make an appointment with the doctor for a hormone screen.  Take her with you to the doctor.  Go into the examining room with the doctor.  Tell the doctor your wife right in front of her that your wife has an unusually low libido and you want to make sure there are no physical issues before you are willing to take further action.  DO NOT say what that further action might be.  Let it ferment in the Hamsters brain.  If the doctor asks say I havent decided anything except that this cannot continue.  Tell the doctor that you have only had sex a few times in the last  years.He may refer you to a therapist or sex counselor.  I would tell him you just want to rule out medical.Your wife can object any time and get you kicked out of the office she is the patient not you.  In that case the very least I would do is head to the mall and get phone numbers for  random women who catch your eye.  The best answer to that is probably to just hand her the divorce complaint you have already filed and ask her to sign a consent judgment right in front of the doctor.,marriedredpill,d6wogmw,1,t5_32dvh

The thing is in retrospect I knew they were going to be starfish because she wasnt really into it  from the beginning. So thats where I decided that if I feel like shes not into it Im just going to stop and not say a word  my action plan is to be proactive and not even get to the starfish sex if you get what Im saying.  The other thing I realized is she was at the end of her cycle and PMS could have affected that to a certain degree. I noticed when she is ovulating she is much more receptive and the sex is much better.   So tracking her cycle has become a good tool to avoid starfish. gtI expect this to pay major dividends and is obviously you operating in your own frame. Guaranteed she is expecting you to beta relapse stay strong and positiveI almost fell into old behaviors last night whining. But I stopped myself.   Then I was reading MAP last night and it hit me like a  ton heavy thing. So this morning I sent her a very brief text and just said we are going to   Have an awesome weekend. It was basically my subtext way of saying IDGDFShe replied with  it is cutie pie.  Any time I am with you whatever we are doing it is great. There  is subtext in her reply also but Im not going to get into all that. The key is that I recognize it today.  I feel like the stage is set now for me to be awesome while she does whatever she needs to get done. And for one of the first times I feel like I genuinely will not be butt hurt. But youre right  she does expect me to relapse into beta behaviors She even baited me a little bit last night but Im not going to fall for the bait because my frame is getting much stronger and I see it coming from a mile away. I guarantee she will bait me a little bit more as the weekend goes along Probably by bringing up the very brief beta relapse I had last night.   I need to come up with a strategy to offset this  Im not sure maybe just a simple STFU.  Then on Tuesday she is going off on a womens retreat for six nights where we will basically have little to no communication. Im not going to say a word about that before during or after.

Then I read it and get more confused.I guess I thought all of that was just normal stuff that dads WANT TO DO. Not out of obligation not because they think it might get them laid but because they genuinely love their kids and enjoy being around them!I genuinely thought red pill was about the truth. This post really muddles up that truth.  I will go as far as to say it almost tells a lie. It certainly muddies the waters so much that it pisses me off and made me write this post.  So I will explain the actual truth of the matterHeres how it really works  being a good caregiver to children is a beta blue activity that feeds the good feelz in your mate. You cant coat it in red and call it redpill.  If you teach your kids manly activities then its a bonus!  If you own the activity like the you should be owning your life its alpha.  It may be alpha but it aint redpill beyond I so totally own my own shit that I am this awesome dad. Its one of the few if only areas where blue things furthers your red pill goals.  Just do it in an alpha male way! Win at kid time!If being a good dad is the byproduct of thinking that you are playing dread game and you have to convince yourself that getting laid is why you are doing it then.... OK whatever works in your mind is ok i guess.... but its not the truth and you are genuinely lying to yourself unless your goal is to show your mate just how happy your kids are going to be when you turn her kids against her divorce her and take them away forever.Red pill is about the truth and that post has truth issues.,marriedredpill,d9vxibw,0,t5_32dvh

I switched to a little bit adjusted x program  redditlink I spend time climbing and my technique is getting slightly better.My plan is to increase callories as soon as I hit my current max.Speaking of the Dread level I am at  right now. That means I am intentionally learning and practicing game. Read Day bang and I am in middle of Models right now. The only deviation to the suggested dread levels is the fact that I would go straight in for the kill which is technically dread ?.I practice on my wife and other women. I do not discriminate. What I found out it is actually fun to game intentionally even only midly receptive wife. It is equaly amusing whey they react and when they do not react. It is like watching mice experiment. Strange feeling.My sex life with wife still sucks and I do not expect it will ever change. I came to terms with that.I do not generate enough tingles as I am not attractive enough. There are no easy gains anymore and every minor improvement is going to be a lot of work. The diminishing return is expected. It is a marathon not a sprint.I failed several shit tests last month. It happens usually when I am tired after the working day. My failures manifest typically as a DEER reaction to the trivial tests like why did you put a cup here and not there.... It is pathetic to be caught off guard like that.My leadership is mostly accepted and appreciated by the crew. Just few short commings last month. One of them is overpromising and not delivering on  particular occasions.My wife supprised me by setting up my birthday party last few weeks ago.

11433241,0,t1_dfrsskd,As someone who blew a lumbar trying to be ambitious let me share what Ive learnt for the benefit of othersBasically disks dont give away suddenly. Rather they happen slowly over time. Your disk is a gellike material that is encased in a coat of fibres. Over time various stresses make these fibres pop one by one. When sufficient number of fibres pop the gel herniates and pushes against a nerve. Usually the sciatic nerve is a good candidate only because its in a narrow space between spiky area of the pelvic bone and the spine. If the gel pushes the nerve against a spiky area the pain is intense and radiates down the leg. If you are lucky the pain could be milder because there was little herniation or it could really be a muscle issue. In general a sciatic impingement should cause a pain deep in the butt.If you ever have a herniation the gel should resorb over  to  weeks. Note that the fibres that popped can reform but can take a very long time All connective tissue heals very slowly. You need one to two years for full healing. If you are older than  it WILL take  years.To speed up healing supplement with vitamind especially in winter or rainy seasons and rest. Once pain completely goes away lift light. Generally  of your weight at high repetitions minimum . When you can do say  reps raise weights a little bit and do  reps.,marriedredpill,dfry2oi,4,t5_32dvh

11478911,0,t3_63cvdy,Finishing NMMNG. Hits home I have spent most of my life surrounded by and trying to please women. I am a wimp. I believe that I am not like other guys.I had my first fitness evaluation this week. Going to start lifting. Completely  out of my comfort zone.This week I have focused on making more guy friends. Had lunch with an old friend which was refreshing. Even reached out to my father to help me with my car. Introducing myself to guys I see in the hall at work. Basically if theres an excuse to spend time with a guy Im taking it.Ive always wanted to visit major us city. I asked wife last week if she would want to go there for a weekend sometime. She said No its way too busy and crowded there. My immediate internal reaction was Ok I guess we will never go there. I will bury that thought. This week I decided that we are fucking going there. I told her I really want to go to major us city. I think it would be a lot of fun. She gave me objections but kept talking about logistics. So we are at least past where I was before.,marriedredpill,dfx4q43,2,t5_32dvh
11542987,0,t3_64n5xf,So about a week ago my wife told me that she feels objectified by me and I responded Good because shes supposed to. Objectifying my wife means she still passes the boner test. Its not like her professional accomplishments and the things she does for our daughter are whats been giving me an erection all these years. Theyre great useful and appreciated but theyre not why I want to fuck her. Even though shes my wife I dont want to fuck her because shes special. I want to fuck her because shes there. Thats normal. Most guys would fuck at least half of the women they encounter during the day without knowing a thing about her hobbies personality or professional accomplishments. Thats how guys fuck. They objectify women. Thats normal.Guys want to fuck a girls body not her social standing. Its women who get turned on by high status not us. I even typed up most of a post about this concept but Rollos latest article touches on that and half a dozen other related topics more succinctly.,marriedredpill,dg4edsj,11,t5_32dvh

11573457,0,t1_dg7o3a3,gt I honestly didnt expect level  to work...caught me off guard and now I have a choice I didnt expect.Lets first overlook that level  is simply you going out to get the sex you deserve...  is the fuck me or fuck you speech  is telling her youre sleeping arounddivorce.Lets also overlook the fact that it seems like theres been a short duration between your level  speech and it working meaning theres no track record here and her reactions could merely come from shock.Lets get more into the question of Why did you throw out level  if you didnt have a plan for its aftermath? ampnbspIn my mind I took the tools up to level  and left the rest. If youre out there showing your wife that you are able toare flirting with other women this is the fuck me or fuck you speech. And in the catchall case that shes fucking dense level  is you showing her a door with looneytunelike arrows pointing to it to remove all doubt that if she does not walk through this door it is a clear statement to you that she is willfully not complying. Unless shes dumb as a box of rocks she can see that you have SMV and that other women are picking up on it. Fuck shes preprogrammed to see that. If she ignores this then flirting with other women simply progresses to plates and divorce. Telling her to fuck you or fuck me overtly is negotiating desire. Telling her youre fucking others overtly is like telling her youre bulking up dieting or practicing game. Its words not actions.  ,marriedredpill,dg7uvk6,2,t5_32dvh

It depends on you her and dread.If you are like me you have few fucks to give and you have to dig deep for single fuck to give so you can kiss your wife on the forehead and slap her ass when she has a tear running down her check because she thinks there is something up between you and her much younger sister for example.If you are an nice guy and you have caretaker tendency then you need to stop smoothing everything over because your wife is using you as an emotional tampon.,marriedredpill,dgtduop,1,t5_32dvh
