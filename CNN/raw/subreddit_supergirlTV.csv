3966022,0,t1_cr8bavs,Well I heard they were writing the show in a way that would keep the possibility open while worked things out. But also not basing it off of the flarrowverse in case things didnt go according to plan. Also Superman could be relatively new. If he were to become active say half way through arrow season  and flash season  he would be famous especially in metropolis but not exactly a public icon. People in starling and central would be focusing on their own problems of which they clearly have many and their own heroes before discussing the relatively new one a few thousand hundred idk miles away. Anyway just an idea I think it would be possible but it would take work. ,supergirlTV,cr8czf4,3,t5_33g1z

The skirt is really just there for style. Same with the supergirl costume. Its a leotard like the new  suit but with a skirt over.

We certainly understand that many people will have watched the leak and will be anxious to discuss it.

As I stated while we may not personally have a problem with pirated material we do not wish for the community to facilitate in the sharing or promotion of said materials.Discussing the leaked pilot while it would help promote both the show and community would in turn promote these illegitimately obtained materials.

4100508,0,t3_36vmn0,The end of the pilot reveals that spoilers Karas mothers sister is alive in the Phantom Zone and is planning to attack the Earth. To do this the General says she needs to kill Kara. While she doesnt say it its obvious that shed need to target Clark as well for her plan to work. This is why I think Superman should die some time around the midpoint of the show. It would be a logical step in the main villains plan and it would establish her as a serious threat. Whats more it would also allow Kara to step out of her cousins shadow and raise the tension of the show by making her the only thing standing between the General and world domination. The only purpose Superman really serves on this show is to bring in the most easily confused viewers who might be confused at the existence of Supergirl without Superman. After the pilot hes more than an impediment as he overshadows his cousin.

5505834,0,t1_cwf3r2v,All right thats a fair point. But to Marvels favour weve seen how they write heroines. Black Widow and Agent Carter are great perfectly developed characters in their own right even despite the lack of movies. Hell Maria Hill became her own thing during the Avengers alone and now shes everywhere when she wasnt even a comic character. Meanwhile on DCs behalf we have the Canaries who dont suck but theyre not exactly the selling point of Arrow Iris West whos become insufferable by now and whoever is hanging in Gotham seriously does anyone watch that show?. Their strongest female right now is Caitlin on The Flash and shes spent half the show mourning her boyfriend. And now we get Supergirl who seems to have good intentions but is walking on the fine line between we can show men were as kickass as them and LOOK AT ME IM A GRILL!.

Like the Reverse Flash bits from the Flash.The Superman bits were hit and miss sadly. He just shows up to scare off Reactron and doesnt stay behind to make sure Kara is okay.

Buuuuut I watch it every week.  Its one of only a small handful of shows I watch. Theres something cheery about it and I like the idea of Superman and Supergirl enough to watch it.  Plus Melissa Benoist is terrific and makes up for a lot of the badness around her.  And I like the feminism in it too.But wow.

6472843,0,t3_448aiq,I still think the best way to do this is to simply use the existing time travel conventions and pretend that up until now we were simply watching two different timelines. I think perhaps in the flarrowverse were all familiar with Vandal Savage destroyed Clark and Karas inbound ships. The LoT can now undo that in the quest to defeat Savage. The moment after the crossover happens everyone in both time lines can just anachronistically start acting like theyve all known about each other all along. What weve been seeing with Supergirl is the timeline where they all exist but flarrow has been showing us a skewed timeline where the supes never made it. Only we the audience need to be in on the gag when they adjust the timeline. This leaves everything before the adjustment including all the times they didnt reference the kryptomaniacs still valid yet we find all of them in a shared universe for happy fun crossover shenanigans. ,supergirlTV,czou5sk,4,t5_33g1z

I think it would a do wonders for Karas character in terms of development. People would stop asking why Superman doesnt just save her  now shes the one saving him and b we could get some sort of dialogue between Big Blue and Supergirl where Superman basically says if she needs him hell be there if not he knows she can handle it. ,supergirlTV,d1p8oa5,4,t5_33g1z

You gotta realize that Superman and any other powerful being has to take it easy when on Earth because simply put theyll destroy the very thing theyre trying to protect.  This has been cited many times even if theyre super powerful they have to keep it down a few notches. Kriptonite is not the only thing that can beat kriptonians pure brute strength can kill them or put them under for awhile.  Getting them out of the yellow sun and even weak against magic. They are going to have to introduce a Superman TV series actor before they can head into Justice League territory.

Furthermore we know hes interacted with General Lane aka aliens are suckers who SUCK get out of our world pls!!!. Given his likely negative experiences with the military its not weird to think that Clark would be inherently suspicious of their motives. In Clarks view giving the DEO kryptonite wouldnt just be opening himself up to vulnerabilities it would be giving the people who actually want to killget rid of him the opportunity to actually do so so naturally hes not gonna like that. He also likely thinks hes protecting Kara by keeping her vulnerabilities from people who want to hurt them aliens so its not like hes being completely selfish or selfcentered here. I think the obvious compromise for the show would have been for Jonn to keep some of the kryptonite for himself since it would be safest in his hands but that clearly wasnt what happened onscreen so. ,supergirlTV,d8xu8a0,3,t5_33g1z

9742660,0,t1_dadympc,Not necessarily.  If that were true then much more time would have passed on Supergirls Earth compared to Earth since last years crossover.  That would mean that if Barry goes to her Earth again without time traveling he would wind up at a point much farther into the future then where the plot of Supergirl is currently at.  Or if she travels to Earth without time traveling she would wind up at a point not long after Barry got back from her Earth.  I think its more likely that time passes at the same speed on both Earths and Barry also traveled back in time when he returned to Earth last year.

Not placing Black people above Whites people. I fully believe that a lot of men are fine with women being at their level. This show especially prides itself this season in having a healthy balance of female and male power. When Kara is subsidized in her screentime Alex is going through a major storyline that promotes sexuality within women.

10558868,0,t1_dd4yli4,Every regular cast member is a main cast member. There is a difference between main cast member and lead character  which you also dont seem to understand. The only lead characters on the show are Kara and Alex.And no a regular cast member isnt necessarily in every episode. James already missed one episode this season. You can be in every episode and not be a regularmain character. You can be in half the episodes and be a regularmain character. You really dont know how this works.It doesnt matter whether Maggie in Supergirl bears little resemblance to comics Maggie. I was giving you an example and actually backing it up with evidence. They are incorporating her into other storylines. She will have scenes with other characters. Your mental gymnastics to negate she isnt a main character isnt working.gtgt how all she contributed to tonights episode was an excuse for alex to be on scene at the livewire breakout and a couple of quips with alex. Wrong. First scene Alex wasnt even present and the other two scenes Kara was present for most of em.  Last episode Kara and Maggie met and it had nothing to do with Alex. Again its the same as saying that Jonn would have very little to do if it wasnt for his storyline with Mgann this season. You take that away and any recurring character has more screentime than him. If she is gone the writers are going to write him another storyline just like they will write Maggie if Alex and Maggie break up. Thats what they do for main cast members.,supergirlTV,dd4ytn9,0,t5_33g1z

10600551,0,t1_dd8ltfk,Personally I disagree with the notion that Alexs relationship is a good point of the season. The early episodes of it were golden however after they became a couple it became unbearable to watch those two. Alex instantly became a way less calculated person who is now way more likely to give up and cry without much thought. Also their scenes together seem so segmented away from the rest of the plot and look like plain diversity and fanservice for diversity and fanservice sake. Dare I say its on a dangerous path to becoming a gay version of Olicity if they dont keep it more relevant? ,supergirlTV,dd9d6do,6,t5_33g1z
10644847,0,t1_ddcsnwt,Perhaps opting to say cherrypicking was far from being the best coherent way I shouldve put it as my intention was to defend my stand on what I am sure and know about what does misandry mean due to what Ive learned and even looked up its definition more than once. What I meant to say was that it feels you are detouring from what I said there that I am claiming that misandry partakes mainly when it has anything to do with straight male love interests and that it actually doesnt necessarily. Ill make things clear once again I do not pair those together. Misandry is when you hate men amp think their gender is reason enough to think amp look down on them it is that simple and my definition all long. Now is it linked in this fandom mostly due to shipping mobiles? Agreed it is yet it isnt any reasonable excuse to skip it because it only perpetuates the practice more and more without end. And just like Im aware that the SG fandom prefers more the female cast Im even more up to date of what ships the shippers are more interested in the LGBTQA or queers as you said no matter if they are absolutely crack Supercat Supercorp Monwinn or actually canon ones. Sanvers And once again this does not excuse the misandry. The determining factor in all of this could be rooted in who of the current heroes looks more awesome in their costumes amp even in that case it would continue to be inexcusable. The fact that it is intertwined with shipping does not make null my points. And if Kara had a female love interest it more than sure would be  much well received that is literally a nobrainer. Had he been gender swapped he would have be judged as any other character despite what his gender was or whatever preference there is. And I strongly disagree with everything youve said about the supposedly unhealthy amp how toxic it is when you end up receiving help from someone like a man when you are having trouble in your lifethreatening challenges. I very and adamantly disagree that because someone sees another person or a partner in this case in this current context a super powered heroine who was struggling with the odds amp the numbers stacked against her in the form of two electric foes and was having for lack of a better word her ass handed to her that is in dire clear and more than obvious need of assistance that it will result in somehow something even worse that you can do to this woman stealing and stripping her off of her agency underminingseeing her as less and underestimating her. For real? And all to just avoid stereotypes? This is really the beallendall mentality of modern? feminism? You either believe that thisthese womanwomen hashave what it takes to carry the job by herselfthemselves and damn you if you dare to interfere at any moment when you see with your own eyes that this is going horribly the wrong way and that if something isnt done soon a life is gonna be lost just because someone had to stubbornly selfishly and even arrogantly prove something either to someone or to herself? Sorry but screw that. That for me isnt feminism that is just bravado and arrogance for not saying navet. He went back and backed her up or protected her because he saw she was not making any progress with those foes. I must be failing very hard at not seeing how that is toxic and bad right now. Help is help. Did we selectively forget about what Kara said to Jimmy about what her familys coat of arms even meant in S episode ? And I see it as a copout that if it was a gender swapped MonEl or heck even an entirely different female character say Alex it wouldnt be as half bad. Why didnt Kara beat the living crap out of Metallo by herself like the strong independent star of the show heroine then and had to rely on her human sister to gear up with a super suit and swoop in to her rescue despite Kara having her own antikryptonite shield and doing just fine before? You have to be a woman in this argument in order to not come out looking so bad I see. I can not get behind this die hard feminism.And I think its taking too seriously something as I thought I was really gonna die back then so I did something silly as my last action because I could not stand seeing you sad back then as that kiss was. Sorry but youre blowing that out of proportion. And I hope that the next argument if there is one coming for this isnt about how he was guilt tripping her with the confession because heads up that is exactly what I meant before about twisting facts and recycling things that Ive seen from S. Also what is this about that he did not let her talkmore focused on protecting his feelings than letting her talk about her own? She was asking him if he really liked her and he came around in the end and she listened to him thats all. Everything that youve said about the cultural context in which finds itself is true trust me that this is not the first that I have read all of those statistics about the scope of feminism in the media. However what is exactly the point with that? That because the current state of feminism in the media mixed with the actual cultural context means that were all in more than ever absolute need for more female representation everywhere and that it means that it has to be above male representation? I havent been arguing about that in the first place nor how important it is to have male representation through MonEl not at all what I only said was that since he is a brand new character for this Season and coupled with the fact that he hails from freaking space and comes and shares an alien background that is sort of similar to Karas that it is expected hell have screen time dedicated to him and whatever baggage hes carrying. Ive been arguing about why the scale of distaste towards the male characters in a feminist show just keeps escalating for whatever reason they are. I agree that it is uncommon to have superhero shows where the the hero is the lady yet I dont think that is reason enough to ever think that we should put the ladies that make up the female side above the male ones because again that to me isnt and wouldnt be feminism. It is supposed to be about the equality of the sexes in every way men and women and women and men on equal grounds and Ive said the show does it well but the fandom hasnt shown it much less alone apparently learned anything from it. The disrespect that has been going on in the infrastructure of the fandom towards the male characters MonEl in this case can not be understandable just because it might urgent to balance the scales as if it was collateral damage. If that is then I sorry but I would have to disagree even harder. Nothing justifies misandry in the same way that nothing excuses misogyny.  Being protective of these shows shouldnt steep down to this. As for the initial fear of having those characters coming over which you shared as well that is also another issue itself that I noticed the androphobia towards male characters. If there is something that could be thesetup for misandry is that thing right here. I never was scared that any of that would happen because Ive always trusted the writers and I knew that they would know exactly what to do. Fandom should trust more the showrunners and writers tbh in that because if not were gonna see the same thing happen ifwhen they introduce Superboy Dan Turpin or hell maybe Ted Kord great characters that will be met with yuck but if later they announce Power Girl or Lois Lane and Lana Lang itll be a resounding FUCK YEAH.I believe that respect should be involved in the middle of equalizing these scales then before we get to the representation everyone deserves.,supergirlTV,dddxn2t,1,t5_33g1z

In Medusa they were all BUT WHAT IF LENA IS WORKING WITH LILIAN? when if she was all the aliens would have died before they even realized it was happening as shed have already handed over the Macguffin needed to make the plan work rather than having Henshaw stage a random not to mention ineffective breakin. And this episode well A shes a hyperintelligent multibillionaire why would she be doing her own dirty work in such an obvious and traceable way and B why on Earth would she go to all that trouble to break out the woman she just put in jail? If she didnt want her in jail she WOULDNT HAVE PUT HER IN JAIL AND FOILED HER PLAN FOR ALIEN GENOCIDE.Come on.....I know that the name Luthor has negative connotations but theres a point where it gets dumb to act like this.....Though on that ending Lenas character is known for being shady and morally ambiguous. But I doubt shes out and out evil. Probably wellintentioned but just....not so nice as she makes out and certainly more manipulative and cunning. Which Im all for.

10916611,0,t1_de3lg2y,I with you pal I really enjoy monel maybe its because I really like Chris Wood but besides some of the dialogue with Kara he acts the shit out of a lot of his scenes. And some of the parts of the relationship are really nice I verbally Awed when Kara was talking to Megon at the bar and asked for whatever MonEl was having and she said he has had nothing but club soda for the past week. The problem people seem to have is that he isnt changing fast enough but a big part of the problem is that they are writing Karas character badly in the Karamel relationship also. Its nowhere near only the writing of MonEl that should be the problem. I really like the Kara and MonEl relationship and it feels more natural than Sanvers imo they went from being people who barely talked to each other after Alex kissed Maggie to dating in the next episode. The arguing can be a little bit extreme in the Karamel relationship I feel like if Kara didnt yell at MonEl as much and just talked to him about what she wants he would be a lot more inclined to listen because he really seems to care about Kara he knows she doesnt need protecting he just cannot help but to try to protect her because of how much he likes her.,supergirlTV,de5yz5i,3,t5_33g1z

11003416,0,t1_deeootv,I do hope its intentional yeah. Although describing it as a shitty upbringing is... while true its misleading. Kara was clearly the golden child of her family dynamic both on Krypton and on Earth. The favored sibling who can do no wrong and gets all the attention. The family scapegoat on Krypton was likely not a sibling. Golden children often dont realize theyre abused because the abuse is subtle. The constant ragging on the scapegoat and inappropriate confiding in the golden child about how the scapegoat makes a parent feel create this threat of withdrawal of love should the scapegoat stop obeying the parent. Any failure to comply is painted as being ungrateful. Meanwhile theres often some excuse for any wrongdoing by the golden child that makes them above reproach but can also be turned around to infantlize the and make them feel worthless. Many golden children who dont get any kind ofenough outside perspective think theyre bad or defective and their parents are great. Kara seems to be in that camp.,supergirlTV,def7ev9,1,t5_33g1z
11004575,0,t1_defaybx,Having Kara and Alex have to deal with the fact that their parents are not only not perfect but worse than average would be an amazing storyline if they go here and it would give Alex a lot of room to grow especially since she is in a better position to do real outreach and knows what its like to be on both sides of the wow aliens are inconvenient issue. She could pitch some kind of social reform or program from the human perspective that wouldnt offend alien sensibilities. Kara and Winn could help her develop it maybe with help from Jonn and Lyra and if they bring Cat back for a cameo she could bankroll it if she picked up it has something to do with mitigating the power of toxic families since her mothers an obvious narcissist and she clearly knows that. ,supergirlTV,defc5ia,2,t5_33g1z

11283203,0,t1_dfarui0,There was a clear romantic arc with Tony Stark. Pepper Potts was in  movies with him. And in Captain America Civil War he was shown to be affected by their break up. Jane Foster was also heavily featured in two Thor movies. She wont be in the next one as that movie is mostly playing off Earth. Thor will have a new love interest though. The Hulk movie had a romantic subplot too. In AntMan the title giving character and The Wasp met who seemingly will be in the AntMan and the Wasp together. And the first Captain America movie had the subplot with Peggy Carter. The Marvel movies which focused on only one superhero tend to have romantic subplots. The ones with tons of superheroes naturally less so as it is already hard to include all the superheroes not to mention their love interests. Like I said already time is more limited in movies.And I havent watched Agent Carter but looking at Wikipedia it only lasted  episodes. Kara was also single for about that amount of time in season  and for a lot more episodes in season . She hardly had a boyfriend on the show so far.

I dont care if your a conservative or liberal but Im a watcher of this show and dont want to be banged over the head with political nonsense. You want to make it political be more subtle about it and make it enhance the story.  I also agree about going both sides of the argument. Not every alien is innocent as we have seen. Also where are the humans of national city. It feels like National City is all Aliens now and if that is a political statement that Americans are bad for America then I really will stop watching. ,supergirlTV,dfh5msv,4,t5_33g1z

11345520,0,t1_dfhyafa,gt If Lillian is stupid enough to buy for one seconds that Rhea wont raze Earth to spite Monel for picking it and Kara over Daxam once Cadmus has held up its end then sure.But Lillian doesnt know that about Rhea. Right? Maybe. Im never sure how much Lillian knows about alien cultures. She might know about the lead weakness that you pointed out. Im sure she has a list of alien species and their weaknesses. But why would Lillian know that Rhea is spiteful enough to kill all humans just to teach MonEl a lesson? Rhea can frame it as being a simple mother who wants her son to come home but her son likes the aliens community here especially Supergirl so she is willing to team up with Rhea to help eradicate aliens on Earth if it means getting her son to come home. She could also frame it as simply being a principle thing Daxam for the Daxamites and Earth for the humans or as doing a good deed by eliminating the menace of aliens coming to Earth taking jobs bringing crime and diseases etc. What Im saying is there are ways for Rhea to frame it so Lillian thinks their goals are the same removing just aliens from Earth.Also and this might be more likely it could be an alliance in which both sides plans to betray the other as soon as they get what they want. They could even know the other side might betray them and both believe they are cleverer than the other. ,supergirlTV,dfhztgx,2,t5_33g1z
