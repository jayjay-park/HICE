1582907,0,t3_2cd75j,With all evidence I see here Hypatia is bad. The reasons this player Jaarad has been banned for are complete and utter bullshit with no real evidence backing it up. From the information of this entire incident and preceding incidents that have happened it just shows how much the admins of Hypatia pay no attention to the details of these incidents. You the admins of Hypatia have labelled him a liar trying to turn the crowd against him as he trys to show the rest of us your true nature. With all of your responses on this thread it indeed proves his points that you are indeed shitmins. The only people who have backed up your server are those who are loyal players and have a bias towards the server therefore they will say nothing bad against it. The one who is in the wrong is not Jaarad it is you admins of Hypatia. He or she is just a player trying to enjoy his time in this spacemen game that we know as Space Station . There maybe was a time when he or she actually liked your server but due to your incompetence of dealing with these incidents it has changed this players opinion of the server. I just wish you would actually listen to your players that have seen your incompetence instead of just having complete ignorance or a bias view. Why not see the full picture? You say he or she slanders your server but you have done that yourself. Continuing this course of action of trying to slander this lone player who most likely has played on your server for quite some time degrades your already plummeting reputation. Just own up to your mistakes that you have committed everybody makes mistakes. But will you own up to these mistakes probably not as you Hypatia admins have too much pride. Once you lose that pride and start to show that you admit your mistakes maybe then peoples opinions of your server will change but only you admins can make that choice. Please make the right one. My opinion of your server is neither with or against Im just dont like it when there is clearly no justice for players who make small mistakes even I have made a mistake that has laid me a ban once or twice. As with the apparent ragequits that Jaarad has been through I would not count those as ragequits but just frustration because of the incompetence that shouldnt be there. I dont want to see your server leave the Space Station  community but I also do not want to see it continue as it is now so please change your ways and work on your weaknesses.

1699391,0,t1_cjrzrom,To my understanding theres two specific definitions for greytide.A. Be an staff assistant and be harmful to anyone and everyone especially security. assistant revolutiongrey tide This is banned in most places. If someone yells out greytide and starts acting bad theyre probably doing some variation of that. I remember on goons an assistant revolution ended up with the detective getting murdered next to bridge. Assistant revolutions never happen because they are awful and bannable and may end up with every assistant being murdered or purged if they go too far. Never underestimate a group of bored grey shirts wanting to cause trouble. Theres usually at least one who knows how to hack or break walls and some of them carry tools in toolbelts or on their persons everywhere. Back when Goons was more griefy I would wear a toolbelt and carry a glass shard for breaking and entering places. Now if I find a reason to hack its mostly to unlock all the items in the vending machines so everybody gets free soda.B. Too many staff assistants on the station and not enough other staff.I think the closest you could get to an actual greytide game mode is if someone created something based on the purge.,SS13,cjtdddq,2,t5_2s9yk

1833052,0,t1_cka12g9,While the mass chaos grief fest that light rp servers devolve into after  minutes gets really old this is the reason I play on them instead of heavier rp servers.  I usually dont mind rp as long as its within reason.  For a while I was checking out some baycode servers and I saw this kind of garbage all the time.  Heads are busy exploring their characters backstory while the station is burning down.  Like I dont care if you do that sort of thing but if its done to the exclusion of your job and is at the expense of other peoples rounds I just get annoyed.  One time I tried playing as an Internal Affairs agent.  Someone was dead in the chapel and new as I was I tried to tell them to take him to cloning.  You shouldnt know about cloning only medical should know about cloning  I can see the tube named cloning pod from the medbay lobby but whatever I guess this is privileged information.  Later on one of the Xenoarchaeologists came back to the station completely insane.  He was babbling nonsense and I tried to get the attention of someone who would know what to do with him.  As soon as command staff found out he was whisked off to the brig by the captain and me and my partner were forbidden from coming in and interrogating him or at least listening.  It was like they were the goddamn men in black.  I thought we were supposed to be the men in black!  Why would we wear these black suits and badass sunglasses if whenever we found anything interesting it was whisked out of our hands by our superiors?  I dont know what they expected us to do while they had their little rp funfest in there give the medbay an inspection?   cryo set up but too many bloodstains?  Another round I was an atmo tech and the HoS had discovered a changeling.  He and the captain put the whole station into lockdown but wouldnt tell us why because nobody but the captain and HoS know that changelings exist.  If I left atmo sec would give me a beating for violating curfew but there was no one in atmo to talk to and nothing to do while they took  minutes systematically searching for more changelings.  It was ridiculous.  Giving the captain and HoS OP weapons and armor makes sense on lighter RP servers because theyre usually the first ones targeted and if you cut off the head sec falls into chaos as does the rest of the station.  When you have a heavier rp server theres really no need to have them get all those toys.  Their main job should be to lead not to singlehandedly kill every traitor on the station themselves.  ,SS13,cka2s93,4,t5_2s9yk

1902027,0,t3_2ge4lt,Im just going to go ahead and say that most of these new servers are generally decent servers. The reason that there are so many servers opening up is because many admins from many servers got sick of their old servers or decided to make a new one with their friends. This is USUALLY why new server start up in the first place sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse.    If the ss playerbase ACTUALLY tried at least HALF the servers that were starting up people might actually move away from the currently overpopulated servers. Lots of new servers close down because they dont get people who join the community and stay. Just a few good men is all it takes.,SS13,ckidsrh,1,t5_2s9yk

2640420,0,t3_2q4jqc,Theres... The time I the Research Director learned the AI was malf  minutes into the round and was terrified into working under his nose turning a blind eye the accidents he was causing stationwide. Or the time I was a vox who had followed the Cargo Tech into their bay hoping to score weird meat drugs only for him to offer some lameass offer involving paper money. So I jumped on his tug and then aimed a pneumatic cannon loaded with gay vampire fanfiction books when he attempted to take it back. Speaking of cargo tugs there was the time I joined late in a tater round where the antags had already been handled. As a responsible Quartermaster I attached  new cars to my cargo trolley hacked every single one and made a carousel in Escape until the Shuttle arrived. Or maybe the time I meant to play a diona and got nuclear operative. The nook squad dismayed at my presence let me torture the prisoners they took captive which mostly involved injecting them with drugs to see what they did. Ooh but wait! There was the time the other ops and I all ended up named after James Bond films and we launched a daring heist on the NSS Exodus to steal their bartenders drink dispenser and have an infinite supply of martinis. The alien scientist round Shiverwulf linked was a favorite. I got to spawn as one of their horrid illicit children. I spoke in a posh English accent and wore a mankini. Pretty sure I was a xeno gigolo. I listed a lot of shit but I think my favorite round has to be the nook round where the nooks decided they were going to be an ACTION MOVIE CREW. One of the admin spawned me as a camera drone a borg with a custom sprite. I could have opened doors for them or hit people with my crowbar but all I did was be a camera with a grating Brooklyn accent. This led to some of the funniest dialogue Ive ever seen on Baystationgt Security What is this drone?gt Director Thats our camera.gt Security Drone what are your laws?gt Drone If these fuckin bozos lose me return me to the Crown Cinema Co.gt Security ...

2681928,0,t1_cn8moh3,Alright there is certain way people on this sub talk about special snowflakes that isnt really present anywhere else but here. When talking about people on tumblr its usually referring to them demanding to get special treatment. This isnt really what were talking about.The way I and others have used it refer to the tendency for people to as you have kind of gotten it break the mould. To be unique. The problem is that while a good RPer SHOULD strive to bring something different to the table these people in their desire to stand out and be different fall into the same tropes behaviors and archetypes so many others have done before. Looking at it like that its very counterproductive  by trying to be unique theyre just doing what everyone else is doing and in the end everyone kind of looks the same. More than that it causes their characters to act ridiculous and unreasonable. A great example of this is Latif a Tajaran who usually plays engineer. The other day security was arresting a rouge sec officer.  sec officers and the HoS were chasing her down the hallway and Latif decided to be a hero and pull out a flash even though the perp was wearing sunglasses. Well the HoS drew out his energy gun but Latif was in the way so he screamed at her to move. She didnt and another sec officer that was coming from the opposite direction was able to stop him. After the perp was arrested the HoS was screaming at Latif informing her she was not a member of security. Latif shrugged her shoulders and said I dont have a reason to care.This is exactly what Im talking about. Shes trying to be the badass antihero but at the same time not give a fuck about anything.

3063923,0,t1_cofjwlf,As CE I had a pet project that I developed over several rounds. Another engi friend and I with some admin help cause he was curious if it would work developed a secondary independent back up cooling system. We left the primary system alone except to tie into the the pipes just before the exhaust vent and just after the intake vent in the core. The system was like the primary except it could be run in a closed loop while on standby. The system would be loaded with N and this would circulate in the closed loop super cooling the gas. The idea was that when the primary system was overwhelmed or failed it would be isolated and the secondary activated. A few valve twists and fresh super cooled n would be injected into the core.

4109488,0,t1_crope8o,there should be a description below the image. Im fairly certain i didnt link directly to the image... Either way Heres the blurbAlright so i mean it still really damned buggy and slow and all that shit... but maybe... just maybe... Ill get it to work smoothly?What youre seeing is me testing sight and lighting through open space walls and tinted windows.What ive done is removed density and opacity vars... and started building a customized lighting and sight engine photon engine?The engine renders light using images to each mob individually this means that using the tinted window concept if one side of the window is darker than the other a mob on the dark side can see a mob on the light side but a mob on the light side cant see a mob on the dark side.There are three key overlays to the lighting and the sight system. The first overlay is the lighting itself first frame. The second is the sight overlay which draws a dither over areas at the edge of your vision and fully black over areas that are completely hidden by other objects.The third overlay is the tint overlay and its the one that seals the deal. It checks if an object is able to block light if its big enough to block light. Then with the material to see how much light it blocks. Anything on the other side of the tinted object is tinted darker based on the materials properties. These windows tint at  or about  white light.The lighting engine is loosely inspired by that new objectbased lighting thing mloc? There is a config option to modify the amount of steps There is between  and  lumens.  is completely black  is naturalperfect lighting conditions  is as bright as it gets. The lighting steps affect how many possible shades there can be.  steps means that for each lumen there is one shade of darkness.  means that there is a shade of darkness for every half lumen.  means theres a shade of darkness for every two lumens.There is also a config option to use dithered halfsteps Its not any more or less processor heavy but its visually different and a personal preference. Heres an example The middle one is with step lighting the bottom one is step with dithering.Again this is barely started and a huge WIP that i might end up scrapping. Its not currently functionalin a playable state and really kind of sucks. But it looks okay in some specific scenarios and hopefully will make it so that mobs can have proper xray vision thermals night vision uvvision etc. So heres hoping! DLighting calculations are totally off right now just cause im a derpy lil nub who cant be bothered to do any trig or physics.Eventually i might add some fancy lighting stuff like refraction and lenses and whatever but for the moment its a little... farfetched.Oh yeah and lighting now uses max light instead of sum light so stacking a bunch of lighters on a tile wont make a massive floodlight.And not really relevant in this post but wall objects now actually go on well walls. Atoms have a position variable that can be north south east west or center.

From other players point of view this would look like some random guy showing up and randomly using grenade on everyone making them lose andor die. Totally fun and interesting.But lets talk about rules. Rules usually cover some not to do extreme points which would make round not fun for many players at once and there are not so much of them. Rules are not guides like say this to him do this at  and dont exit your workspace or you get banned. If you think about them it is amazing if how often players manage to break them. You tell that interesting rounds are better than rounds where everyone follow rules. Just like they are two different things. What makes a round interesting? John Baldman loves to explode things. Is it interesting and fun for him? Yes. Is it interesting or fun for people who died from sudden explosion in middle of epic mystery solving? No.What justifies breaking rules? Boring rounds? Boring is different for everyone and again some players only love explosions and death. Often players try to make rounds more interesting only for them making round less interesting for other players or completely removing many players out of game. Lets talk about your story again. Did cultists action really justify chloral hydrate grenade? What if only  or  of cultists were that bad? What if the people who killed you were not cultists at all? What about all the other maybe innocent players you would killstun? You dont really care about them you have tried to show round antags as some really bad guys by making some crazy assumptions.

5109568,0,t1_cv1vijc,I am aware this is copypasta but Im going to explain why it isnt relevant in this case. You people seem to think copypastas are funny by definition if theyre relevant and you post them even if theyre not hoping others upvote them on sight.Let me tell you thats not how it works. For instance the fact that you decided to use that copypasta in this situation indicates that you think a the situation was complexb it has been oversimplifiedc it adds nothing to the conversation. Well you see complexity is subjective thats the nature of emergence. Whats complex for a child like you is often trivial or routine for a scientist like me. Reddits userbase is quite diverse although there seems to be evidence of an overrepresentation of individuals exhibiting childish behaviors. Secondly do you really think this situation has been has been oversimplified? Its through using copypastas and other hasty generalizations you try to cram each individual scenario with its particularities into a formulaic mold. I hypothesize you require this simplification because of the state of your mental faculties and reasoning skills. And lastly most of the time your simplifications do not aid in understanding new facets of the subject matter. Characterizations that might not be  accurate can act as useful models for understanding overarching facets of complex interdependent systems but your copypastas do not facilitate in that endeavor.If even one of these criticisms is valid your point is moot as it depends unilaterally on all the three premises Ive highlighted. The social commentary you wish copypastas to exhibit might seem sensible maybe even profound to you but theyre just as bad if not worse than the additions reactiongifs pun chains or novelty accounts bring to the table.

Im the Engineer who speared the blob out of the way during the round where you were hooting about justice.I have to agree with you about Leigh they can be a bit godawful at times but theyre honestly not as shit as they come off to be. Theyre just obsessed with eating literally everything that they can which has gotten them adminbussed more than once. We often refer to them halfjokingly as a snakeularity due to this.I would like to note that regarding Jaelyn they have a snowflakey thing of bloodrage due to being a shark. Just yell at them in LOOC NO CONSENT if they start fucking about and theyll have to back off or face angry bwoinks. Snowflakery aside theyre a decent enough Sec player. Chances are that was one of the shitter clowns weve had recently like Dolfy Shittler. He lives up to his name.As far as Engineering and the Singulo its often not set up due to a recent influx of complete mouthbreathers who cant set it up or maintain it correctly which means that the actually competent engineers try not to leave it there for the morons to go OOH SHINY I SHOULD PRESS THE BIG  BUTTON and let it loose.As far as the naked masturbating Slimegirl tell players like that to knock it the fuck off. Failing that Ahelp it. Failing that dunk them into disposals until they learn their lesson. At least it wasnt one player we used to have who would play Chef naked and jerk it into all the food. They tended not to survive very long into the shift.Eating Ian is not okay. People who do it will get dunked on andslashor adminbussed.Thank you for actually posting something that isnt FUKKEN RRIES or they have le epik races P licks u regarding Citadel.

So now this unstoppable force of protection has a trigger that lets a single asshole declare one of our charges as marked for death and sic the immaculate omnipotent doorcrusher bot on the poor bastard. Which is why if youve got suspicion that someones going to upload a dehumanizing law thats a Law  need to lock the doors and out the Captain as a dehumanizing swine.But then you get into tricky philosophy where youre considering immediate harm none and future harm near infinite and at least on tg youre supposed to prioritize immediate harm i.e. youre not allowed to kill Hitler to save anyone just nonharmfully stun and lock in a room. So theres no immediate harm in toggling the mental flag humannon so good luck getting an Admin to appreciate your justification By tagging them nonhuman great harm will maybe perhaps befall them based solely on my hunch which is based on hundreds of previous rounds!Id love to see a law The Captain may designate humans to be nonhuman and destroyed because I think you could get away with Law  ignoring the captain but noooo its always Only X and people X say are human thus dehumanizing everyone but X right at law time.AI is a fun role.,SS13,d1knofp,6,t5_2s9yk

7225380,0,t1_d1z9bmp,gt And honestly i think that causes alot of salt towards bay as people expect goofy spacemen and get serious spacemen who are only occasionally goofy.That fits my experience pretty well actually. Id love Bay if it took that same quality approach to roleplay but stopped pretending they were playing a different game in a different setting. With a little creativity you can actually say that Hipyog Tiji tg Paradise etc. are all concurrentlyexisting Nanotrasen stations  The shitty ones are just the punishment assignments in backwater sectors.I mean sure we can cut the st century memes and shitty English but to deny things like robust as a catchall adverbnoun valid as an actual incharacter concept you wont get in trouble for doing bad things to this guy comdom and shitcurity as insults Cuban Pete and Lord Singuloth as pieces of history? To deny these artifacts of SS culture is to deny that you are playing SS. To conflate these artifacts of SS culture with the lowRP hipnoxyogoon playstyle is equally mistaken  these memes arent part of some general playstyle theyre spawned by the very game were sharing. By conflating SS culture with undesirable playstyles and then denying both you lose a vital part of the essence of SS.IMO another mistake is calling the whole seriousgoofy thing a dichotomy. That is assuming that you theyre mutually exclusive when they arent. Part of that vital essence of SS is playing the goofy straight  to us this is goofy but to our characters this is the norm. Spess isnt just a strange place  its an absurd one that has only a tenuous connection to our everyday lives in the st century. Thats what makes roleplaying in it so interesting to me  extrapolating on what we see in every round and asking What sort of person would like this? What sort of life would this be?. The best part is you can play that straight. You can take clowns slipping the captain on a banana peel seriously because sometimes thats a real hazard of the job. By taking away that sheer absurdity you take away part of what makes Spess Setting  so charming.,SS13,d1zgzyn,5,t5_2s9yk

People were rounded up by the dozen and had their bits and pieces removed. Since sec never set up a way to track who was reassigned people were getting mandatory surgery multiple times. The medbay ended up being a sort of gulag for the tobeprocessed and I think at one point they started using ghetto surgery to speed up the process wirecutters yikes. Pretty much nothing got done record numbers of ahelps were submitted and malf AI greentexted.We ended up having to ban an entire sec team along with the captain and I hope to never admin another round like it.,SS13,d6ziqwd,0,t5_2s9yk

The main question stems from the character not understanding why they havent been banned but Natcula and PredatoryInstinct were.  At this point the situation has been handled. No they were not banned for kissy kissy stuff it was for breaking the dont be a dick rule not going to go into too much detail on the matter. A third person was also a part of the situation causing the shit between the three that led to being dicks and they were all given two weeks off from the server.  There was some miscommunication on our part as the original ban was due to ERP but the senior staff agreed that thats a little too much as it was just a kiss. The ban was replaced after information came up showing the two in question being dicks outside of the game to other players but there were not properly informed of it.

Also I even said that the proof in your appeal was correct you shouldnt have been permad but the fact that you were hostile throughout your time on the server and had another incident of it meant you needed to come to the forums to tell us why you acted that way and why you should come back which would have made you unbanned in probably  hours because that was a permauntilappeal as are most of our permas. Stop acting like the staff are absolutely horrible on all HRP servers just because you have evidence of events that have already been seen by just about everyone on this subreddit.

10397564,0,t3_5mbt8l,I played it like  or  years ago and I remember one particular game.I enjoyed being a priest and this time I played as priest of Cthulhu. So Im chillin in my priest place I think I made some kind of leaflets that I left in cantine. Got nice bit of roleplay explaing some random dudes the beauty of Cthulhu religion but got bored and started to pray to great Cthulhu admin to give me power to spread his word to the masses. And to my suprise and joy admin answered by spawning random Books of Cthulhu around the station. Well it was not a suprise that people wanted to know what the hell is happening so the first place they went to was my little chapel. Long story short some fight occured and I found myself lying on the floor in critical state. As my final moments I offered my body and soul to the Elder God praying to Cthulhu that I want to have strenght to worship him. Admin answered by turning me into eldritch abomination. Unfortunately Ive got killed pretty quickly but it was not over yet. Detective got me cloned so they can interrogate me about all this strange occurences on station and I enjoyed my last moments on station laughing maniacally inside medbay and talking some cryptic cultist stuff.,SS13,dcmmp2x,1,t5_2s9yk

10514102,0,t3_5qfvv7,tgstation  Use to be Gamemasters trying to help players get a good round now its not that anymore. The code branch became more like a video game than a tabletop video game hybrid. Most people start here. If you like basic controls and easy to pick up jobs start here its a great place to learn new stuff.Yogstation  The community here will adminhelp ANYTHING if you expect player interaction to solve these cases dont go here. Other than that its nothing really special and its an average shift every round. It runs on the same tg code here its just a different atmosphere. Paradise  Distinctly different codebranch than TG if you like long stupidly long I mean seriously this shit will take FOREVER long shifts and having to spend a few weeks learning everything about one job then go here. Paradise code branch is considered the high roleplaying standard of code.Hippie  Its as bottom tier as it gets however coming from someone who played there a lot the best thing this station offers is player interaction. Admins wont intervene as much on a lot of things you can expect almost every problem the crew has with each other to end ICly and only ICly usually in a bloodbath. This station uses old tg code which many people enjoy myself included.Goon  This is an entire different ballpark here son its a lot to learn and Goons main strength is the amount of secrets there are. You know how each station has their own wiki that tells everything? Not here. Goons wiki will tell you bare minimum everything after is found out by player testing and exploration. Its a treat to play for the first time afterwards the magic dies down but still my recommendation.Colonial Marines  Has nothing to do with the core Space Station  mechanics its basically the Aliens movies by Ridley Scott but you can play as both marines AND aliens in a tacticool setting. Its had some drama but I dont know the status of it now. If you like being Shooty McTooty or Stabby Stab then go here.,SS13,dczvwg2,1,t5_2s9yk
