1066561,0,t1_chphwft,Thats the thing I already own LL I just havent gotten around to playing it yet.  If redux is just the same thing with a graphics overhaul and all DLC included Ill skip it but if it actually includes significant new content I might pick it up as well.,metro2033,chpitnk,1,t5_2t42q
1534261,0,t3_2atm9o,Baumansky Alliance. One of the not as well known factions thats mentioned a few times in the books. The Alliance is a group of three stations on the ArbatskoPokrovskaya Line. Their main trade is to refurbish and recreate prewar tech from the surface and selling them to other factions. They are also known to supply power to parts of the Metro most likely Hansa as there is a power plant in the station Elektrozavoskaya.While it is most likely Hansa helps protect the Alliance in return for technology they appear powerful enough to hold their own and prevent being absorbed into the Hansa like some of the other small factions.Some of this info may or may not be completely true since Baumansky has yet to be visited in the books.,metro2033,cj8lgg7,1,t5_2t42q
1665043,0,t1_cjoy32d,Aye.  It looks like my mind is made up.  Thanks to all of you who filled me in.  I was having a tough time deciding because it was more about Last Light Redux that didnt look anything remotely different in any way and I was confused.,metro2033,cjp1gp5,2,t5_2t42q
1716502,0,t1_cjvisuj,Ill probably do it but still it seems like a real sting. I guess reading between the lines I should blame the publisher not the devs for this state of affairs. At least you get a  discount on redux if you own the game already on steam.,metro2033,cjvj05i,1,t5_2t42q
1768883,0,t3_2emp6n,My issue right now is a major texture bug. A lot of textures wont render in both  redux and LL redux starting from the main menu.

1788135,0,t3_2evkhi,RPK You can get an extended magazine for the AK effectively making it an RPK.Ashot Not included sadly though the shotgun shell traps are made out of old rusty ashots.Lolife Not included nor have I seen any mention of it.Saiga You can see NPCs wielding it at times but I have yet to be able to pick upbuy one Currently right before black stationValve Do not know if its included or not.Preved Same as aboveClapperVSSK As far as I know it was only usable in the faction pack nowhere else.Medved Same as aboveGatling gun If only this was included it would have made mowing down watchmen so much easier.I hope this helps in any way.,metro2033,ck4jolr,2,t5_2t42q

2414120,0,t1_cm9tkfh,Thank you for the detailed response.So in ranger you check your journal to see how much ammo you have outside of clips?That sucks about the two weapons and instead of three but Im happy to hear the HUD fades away. Ill definitely look for that shotgun. Do you upgrade the same shotgun has you go or buy them?And for difficulty its between regular survivor and spartan before picking easy normal or hard right?,metro2033,cma3ed2,2,t5_2t42q

4327517,0,t3_3akfri,if youre caught you arent screwed. In pretty much all cases you can fight your way through enemies. A lot of the time youll be able to lose them again too by running into unlit areas and hiding behind things although they will remain on high alert. If you end up dying save points are very frequent so its not much of a drag. ,metro2033,csdfv4u,2,t5_2t42q

10605498,0,t3_5rirgs,Not a storyrelated purpose but the Metro series got a lot of attention with Last Lights release like me and even more so with Metro Redux.
