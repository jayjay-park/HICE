661974,0,t3_21pq03,There is also a night train if you miss the marshrutkas. I took it once to Yerevan its pretty cheap although I rode second class with my friends and obviously it was kind of a cattle car. Im pretty sure it leaves from the Central Station around  or midnight and I remember us arriving in Yerevan around  or . There was on stop at the border where the nonGeorgians had to get out and buy a visa but it was relatively simple.,Sakartvelo,cgfilg8,2,t5_2s9o3

4391502,0,t3_3b8qfv,When I was in Kazbegi the driver of a minibus I took back to Tbilisi had to swerve nearly  degrees around potholes big enough for the vehicle to get stuck in. And there were a lot of places like that. Add in erratic belligerent drivers and the likelihood of getting screwed in the fineprint of the rental contract and Id say having a local do the driving and take responsibility for that is definitely the way to go. ,Sakartvelo,csknpa7,1,t5_2s9o3
5463186,0,t1_cw9vxun,Being slightly behind is technically trailing but yeah not really by much. But the way the poll has been reported you wouldnt know that. I had to have it explained to me by a more knowledgeable friend yesterday in order to realize that. I dont think that someone at the Washington Post is current enough on the nuances of that poll to catch that either. Heck I live here and am an infojunkie and I still didnt catch on right away partially because my knowledge of statistics is so negligible that I think a standard deviation means a common socially acceptable fetish.,Sakartvelo,cw9z1yb,1,t5_2s9o3
7010697,0,t3_4bloj5,the big part of the problem is poor city planning. constructing multilevel residential buildings without proper underground parking and leaving decades old infrastructure untouched. what could go wrong right? city roads arent able to accommodate todays traffic levels caused by all this upscaling. also yeah having to walk on the road because sidewalks are filled with cars is extremely irritating.,Sakartvelo,d1b0c77,4,t5_2s9o3

7946276,0,t3_4nv8ln,You can contact the Georgian ministry of economy and economic developments tourism department which seems to have a lot of resources.Im sure that your former foreign minister Carl Bildt knows that the country exists. He had a quite cozy relationship with our former president and used to smuggle documents in and out in his diplomatic suitcase. Bildt runs a PR agency which tried to help Saakashvili promote his failed political career. They are partners you might say.

10433350,0,t3_5ohd0j,I accepted Trump as a meme when he wanted to run for the President then I kinda started liking him. He has an ego which I like  he believes in himself however as the others have mentioned his relationship with Putin worries me. The only thing which makes me kinda happy is that James Mattis Mad Dog now the United States Secretary of Defense hates Russia. I am sure that Putin is just playing the ball of liking America. Come on everyone knows that Putin hates Americans. Thats just the way it is  he is jealous of how successful the United States is compared to Russia and that they are  world power.,Sakartvelo,dcqou56,1,t5_2s9o3
