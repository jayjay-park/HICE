11287518,0,t3_6139v0,I saw Skederms one amp wrote up this whole rant before I figured it was more the mods judgment call than mine haha.uSkederm in particular seemed not to understand that what makes them spammy isnt how they treat the community blind consumers lol but how they navigate the platform of Reddit itself. These are Reddits rules on spam and selfpromotion Skederm is in violation of Reddits rules on these things altogether all their submissions are marketingpromotional Skederm posts... and their username is pretty hilarious in how shamelessly its meant to represent the brand. Reddit wants users to be people first  that engage with the platform in a myriad of ways  not a brand first that happens to have a person Jason behind it. Basically if anyone were to report Skederm to Reddit admin right now admin would ban them. Nobody has reported them to admin though because most of the time Skederm is posting to subreddits that explicitly want discount codes coupons special deals etc. so they dont raise any red flags in those communities. But in this community amp the other one Skederm posts to rRosacea its a different deal the purpose of this community and Rosacea is to chat with people not brands to help and support them. Help amp support comes in many forms but one of them is recommending products that work. uSkederm as a flagrantly obvious marketing account is compromised in judgment for doing anyall of that and so I dont think that user or any other users thatre clearly working for a skincare brand should have a place here.If their products are legit unbiased users will start talking about it here. In the meantime if Skederm really wants to promote on Reddit they should pay for ads like everyone else. And keep all the discount code releases to subreddits thatre specifically for discount code releases.If yall are interested in those subs heres the list of them that skederm posts to  rDiscountedProducts  ramazondealsus rDealsReddit  ramazonspecials  rVeryCheap  rcoupons Edit One of my favorite things that I see in rLushCosmetics is people that actually work for Lush have normal usernames participate all around Reddit and whenever a user has a question about Lushs products or how things work or upcoming events inside the sub the Lush employee will pop up mention theyre an employee and give more infoclarification on whatever the user was asking about. In this way they become somewhat wellknown in the subreddit amp theyll get usernamementioned frequently inside the sub to shed light on a question they could probably answer. That more than anything is how Jason should be working to promote Skederm with a Reddit account.,MatureBeauty,dfbf9ra,3,t5_2w9p5
