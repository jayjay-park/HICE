5334140,0,t3_3o2omm,This is a beautiful post and I agree with both of your suggestions. Putting the number of stones before the square notation is easier to read for me and adding the type of top stone should make it easier to picture the board quickly.PS Thanks so much for figuring out a notation it would have taken me days to do it.,Tak,cvthuhb,2,t5_32t90

5739883,0,t1_cx7wg8h,Yes the program mentioned by the OP with the AI included can open PTN files and replay the games.  Use the left and right arrow keys to rewind the game back to the beginning and then step through one move at a time.,Tak,cx8l72p,2,t5_32t90

7400686,0,t1_d2jec6n,gt A flatstone win is an inelegant win. A beautiful game ends with a completed road.Ive only had a couple games end this way but I didnt find it particularly inelegant.,Tak,d2jeqmf,3,t5_32t90
7411615,0,t1_d2k35xk,I agree,Tak,d2knh5t,1,t5_32t90
7431128,0,t1_d2msxmg,Id like to imagine the uncouth trying to treat it that way only to be swindled by the clever and charismatic.. Stone limits would of course still apply.Also just because you are not playing the courtly game doesnt mean that you dont necessarily care about how your game effects your reputation! ,Tak,d2mvejo,4,t5_32t90
7481446,0,t3_4hlkno,I have a theory that it might be possible to increase the strength significantly with a tiered value function. Do the  plies with the fast function and then at something like  plies make a small adjustment based on all the relevant parameters that aint included in the fast value function. Itd effectively be a tie breaker for all the moves that that the fast value function considers equal. Obviously it should include some measure of how close each player is to building a road and I guess a more sophisticated way of determining stack value could also be included.,Tak,d2sljtr,1,t5_32t90

7499278,0,t1_d2uls1j,This is a great post but I dont think it fits as a pin. Its really not timesensitive and has potential to grow endlessly. If you want to create a kind of gallery page on the wiki that might be best.,Tak,d2umnvu,2,t5_32t90

7612475,0,t3_4jl2og,hmm... I have a possible solution label x one way and x the other. That is pick a board orientation and label the left and bottom axis for x. Now rotate the board  degrees. Now label the new left and bottom axis for x. This way you can just point the appropriate label scheme to the white player and play as relevant.,Tak,d37hylc,4,t5_32t90
7621170,0,t3_4jmr9l,If this were to be sustainable itd have to be only some of the matches you played. Friendly matches are played for fun or for a small coin but if someones talkin shit or theres a tournament or something you could challenge someone to a Capstone match or some other cleverer name.When I first saw this I assumed you meant tournaments would give out trophies sized to be capstones and I thought this was very cool also.,Tak,d38hjue,3,t5_32t90

7673286,0,t1_d3dbh41,Ah I was only really looking at the second game because I was transcribing it. Looks like they did it correctly for the first game and just screwed it up in the second good to know we havent all been playing the opening wrong D,Tak,d3eeon8,1,t5_32t90

7715057,0,t3_4l00u7,There have been alternative methods for scoring suggested in this sub before but regardless of the one we ultimately choose I agree with the two game format where each player gets a shot at playing first. If one player wins both games the match is over. However if they split wins regardless of the type of win flat road or time they should play a third and final game as a tie breaker in which the player with the higher cumulative score in the first two games gets to play first privilege of playing more beautifully if the decided upon scoring type encourages that.,Tak,d3j5dr5,9,t5_32t90

7890205,0,t3_4n9ndk,Having played a number of twoplayer games competitively most of which involved cards of some kind the idea of asking for an undo is anathema to me.  I made the mistake if it costs me the game then Ill know to be more careful next time.Assuming no stakes however Ill generally offer undos if the other person wants to continue playing.  Ill even usually offer it before they ask.Additionally if we decided beforehand to call tak and either I or my opponent call tak and the other person doesnt react appropriately its their own fault.,Tak,d42xkih,2,t5_32t90

8193319,0,t1_d51g2ic,Ive seen it suicide in testing creating a road for its opponent. Since all moves look equally bad all should result in a loss it just chooses one at random. ,Tak,d51pt0g,1,t5_32t90

8962675,0,t3_52zie7,Yes I believe it is.  if you get a road in one win that would be  points.  If you win by flats and have a difference of  flats you would have a score of     .  I had a game the other day where someone kept putting up walls but not moving them and I had a score of  based on the difference of flats on the board.  So it is entirely possible.,Tak,d7p6fv3,1,t5_32t90
