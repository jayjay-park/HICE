2123597,0,t1_cl9k7cd,Reno is obviously not in California. However it is on the margin of California just as is Las Vegas which I also include. Weather does not magically stop at manmade boundaries. A weather event in Reno is within sight of California and often even effecting the California side of the border. Therefore I add the stuff on the margins as it is noteworthy due to proximity. As for the Boca thing that was an incidental error as other Boca references do have it as being California. Thanks for spotting that one. ,CaliforniaDisasters,cl9r7qv,2,t5_2wi0e
