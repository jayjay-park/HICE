6078707,0,t1_cyg6pp5,Braehead arena when used for hockey is around  so yeah they fill pretty much every game. The reason is mentioned above no marketing is done really which is a great shame because some teams like SheffieldNottingham could become even bigger and better if they spent some money on advertising OR if the league did some advertising of its own. Some teams like Edinburgh suffer because of their ancient arena and lack of results over the years. ,EIHLHockey,cygehf5,1,t5_2zsf9
