7175167,0,t1_d1thher,Scroll back to the start of the video the cop car is next to Dumbass for awhile and even slightly ahead briefly. Did he think the cop just magically teleported away? Problem one lack of persistent situational awareness.Then look where the cop is for most of the rest of the time hes far enough off his back bumper that the driver should have been able to see him in the passenger mirror. So either the mirror is aimed badly or the driver isnt checking it. And then Dumbass clearly starts making his lanechange without checking at least his blind spot and probably also his mirror. There may have been others speeding but this guy was clearly the most dangerous in this video.,instantkarma,d1tr0jx,4,t5_2ugf9

Less scared they are very transparent with their body language and if you know how to read them that instantly makes you much much safer around them. Additionally theyre not just evil creatures. Lol. More scared theyre gtkg animals which can hurt you intentionally or accidentally and a lot of the time injuries are accidental. That makes them weirdly more dangerous in my opinion. Big prey animals can be dangerous.

Until just before the dude decides to smash the window you can hear the bus driver talking to what seems to be a passenger. Theyre gonna come out losing. Just before and after the first window hit you can hear one of them trying to calm him down. Hey calm down Luis?! Calm now calm now calm now! Tranquilos is plural for Tranquilo which means calm but in this case its being used as a sort of Gentlmen gentlemen... sort of appeasing word if that makes sense.Then the same guy begins saying something about friends before the window breaks and it all goes to shit.After that its just them lamenting Mr. Luis? stupidity.,instantkarma,da6dpfp,5,t5_2ugf9

To assume it was not red prior is at least just as much an assumption but from what we have theres no evidence otherwise and we see both vehicles entering the intersection at a red light. A yellowamber light after all still requires you to stop if able to do so which also factor in stopping distance and conditions. Bacially if you were doing everything right youd be able to stop.I dont know the laws where this was but where I am you can get a ticket for running an amber light.
