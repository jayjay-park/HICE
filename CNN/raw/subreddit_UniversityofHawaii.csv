813705,0,t3_1zz8hv,UH business program is actually quite good.  I majored in finance and management at UH shidler and became an Officer in the Navy.  I left active duty and am now a financial analyst for the federal government.  I think in terms of academics the program is as good as almost all other business programs except for the super prestigious schools like Wharton and the Ivies.  I was quite impressed with the on campus recruiting for accounting and finance majors.  Theres plenty of internship options for students in Japan and Hawaii.  A lot of my class mates went to the Big  accounting firms.  If youre planning on going into business save your money and do UH.  A USC degree will cost you much more and the benefits will be marginal especially in Hawaii.  Save some of your GI bill for a K MBA if prestige is your thing.  ,UniversityofHawaii,cgwrsyo,1,t5_2spbc

6886218,0,t3_4a2hzb,Summer classes are more condensed. Even the longest summer course that stretches both summer sessions is a month shorter than a normal fall and a month and a week shorter than a normal spring semester.I cant testify to the level of KCCs ENG  but at UHM its been supereasy two papers one  pages due a little past halfway through the semester and one  page due at the end of the semester. The class consists mostly of the teachers ramblings on whichever topic a person had made a presentation on that day. Personally I find it was easier than my final year of HS english but could be due to my instructor. If I could do it all again Id do it in the most condensed form as possible to just be over with it.,UniversityofHawaii,d0wvbfi,1,t5_2spbc
