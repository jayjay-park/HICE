5909801,0,t1_cxua9xb,I wanna say that I picked up an aerochamber for  for  diameter. It would be much cheaper with a  diameter. Its not necessarily the volume that is the problem with chambered mufflers more the certain notes and vibrations that are a product of the exhaust bouncing around so much. But I understand. Im on a major budget too. ,mini_trucks,cxub38j,1,t5_2zf3r
9854222,0,t3_4o63qv,I know its not on your list but if you can find one Nissan Hardbodies are great little trucks. As far as your list goes either Toyota will be reliable but will have a tall premium over the Americans. The S with a . is a good combination if a little coarse avoid the . at all costs. The Ranger is your best bet for a cheap reliable pickup but theyre finicky. The  cylinders are all dogs except for the later  versions the . will last forever but is deadly slow the . OHV which wont be found in any model past  is a doggy but reliable lump and the . SOHC is a great engine but the timing chain setup is Rube Goldbergian in complexity.TLDR  If youre willing to spend a bit more buy the Toyota. If you want a crude cheap pickup buy the S. If you want a higher quality pickup than the S buy the Ranger but watch out for certain key defects.,mini_trucks,das10ew,1,t5_2zf3r
