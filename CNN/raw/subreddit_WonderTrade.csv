184102,0,t3_1w7jvi,Wonder trade should be completely fine the pokemon you send have censored nicknames and barely anyone even sends out pokemon with nicknames to begin with. Online modes in general are a bit different. There is no way to text chat but there is a voice chat but that can only be enabled if you are friends with the other player. There is a way to disable voice chat however and in the DS settings you are likely to be able to disable the ability to add friends. Yes its perfectly fine but if you need my help in disabling voice chatbeing able to add friends just ask.,WonderTrade,cezen0w,8,t5_2yrvs

Youd need to move your pokemon from pre gen all the way up to a version of those. However you can ask for people to help you. If you trade them your old pokemon they might be willing to move them up for you possibly via Pokecheck or trade. Usually people only do that if you give them something good for their effort. If you dont have sth you can always try rpokemongiveaway and request help there. ,WonderTrade,cfol5n7,2,t5_2yrvs

Im sure people appreciate it I sure do if I get a pokemon I like to keep.I dont think any of your effort is wasted Ive been trying to think myself what I should breed after I get a couple of shinys.

Its saving time and Im having fun with these Posts. Worst case scenario Game Freak beefs up the hack checks and wont let them pass to the next Gen so with a Breedable that already has been hatched with Egg Moves will likely pass that check over a Pokemon I just used a Move Modifier code on.

7774677,0,t3_4lqc5n,I make an effort to record every single trade I make. Im over  trades now  At first I was recording everything but it can be time consuming so now I only record the main points of interest.I find theres just enough time to record the gender and Country of the person before the trade animation begins. I usually record the secondary location because my browser has remembered a lot I previously typed in. But every now and then I only record the Country. As I watch the animation I enter the Pokemon and ball and by then the trade is finished. I go through the WTsave process then enter the level and all the other items if applicable. I only enter OT details if the Pokemon is shiny. I think the whole process takes maybe a minute give or take? I know that if I time my trades with AuSLoves timer I usually have enough time to enter all the above and click back to do another trade in time. Ive gotten fairly proficient at this if I do say so myself.Other than recording my own received trades I use the site to see whats recently been traded to others to see whats too common vs whats uncommon to see whats shiny etc. This helps me decide what to send out. The site was the the main influence and assistance towards the Mass Tradeout event thats being planned.Also I really do find it fun to see my own progress  how many trades I did in one day etc. Yeah it takes longer than just trade trade trade but I kind of feel like it makes each trade matter more to me. ,WonderTrade,d3px1yt,3,t5_2yrvs

8526226,0,t1_d62d4tw,Aside from this and what Azheron said if youre looking for a breedable you can use Friend Safari for it might be  Im not side IVs to be perfect  of the time plus a chance of Hidden Ability if you have met certain requirements for XY you can build a chain with the PokRadar and eventually the Pokmon will be guaranteed to have better IVs for XY or DexNav which allows you to see if it has  or   IVs perfect and a chance of the Hidden Ability which you can also view for ORAS.     If youre looking for a legendary and have a game from generation   or  however different generations will be more difficult than others and will have a wider or smaller variety of Pokmon you can use something called RNG abuse. There are various guides on this but the best place to start would be rPokemonRNG.     Hope this helps!         Edit  I missed that you said non breedable Pokmon.
