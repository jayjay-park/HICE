3833799,0,t3_34c5tb, If you have a gmail account they have a history of problems receiving wurm emails. Check SPAM folder or try whitelisting the wurmonline address or try using a different email The GM contact list is not easy to find it is in the GM HALL section of the forums or the wiki both of which will send you here       Place to start is likely with Enki Head GM who will then pass the request to one of his team. Enkis forum account is here         FORUM and GAME accounts are separate and usually people can register to forums without problem it is the game registration only that GMAIL seems to block See also if this thread has any help  ,wurmonline,cqtabo9,3,t5_2sne0
