10040821,0,t3_5jhzqx,Margrave Ernest had three options he could stay in Austria and defend go help Bohemia which was in dire need of help or attack go attack Carinthia to take advantage of the situation and gain land. There were advantages and disadvantages to all options. The first one was popular with the clergy which to be honest wanted none of the Austrian forces fighting and fighting for the emperor. However if the Bohemians were wiped out there would be nothing stopping the Bavarians from invading Austria.The second option was the honest way to go. The betrothal between Bohemia and Austrias children has been made and Bohemia specifically asked Austria to support them if Bohemia was invaded. This however could make Austria defenseless and an easy picking for Swabia and Carinthia.The third option was admittedly stupid. It was made by a drunken peasant one day and the plan was presented to the Margrave soon after. The best defense is a good offense! said one. After contemplating for a while Ernest Margrave of Austria had made his choice. He would lead  men into the western border of Bohemia to defend against the Swabians and have the other  men of the army stationed in walled towns in Austria. The honorable way is the right way. said the king as he rode off to Bohemia.,IronPowers,dbgcfpv,3,t5_3giah

10072401,0,t3_5k0krk,The Coalition navy will shift moving to blockade Bari as the Roman navy evacuates the straight of Messina.A siege will be laid upon Bari by the Coalition forces and a message will be fired into the city en masse tied to arrows written in Latin and Greek that readsRoman soldiers your false emperors has sent you to foreign lands with no hope of victory simply to sate their lust for glory. Men who ally with Muslims that forsake the Lord Jesus Christ and pit Christians against Christians in a futile attempt at fame are not fit to call themselves Roman. We urge you to lay down your arms in the face of this Italian siege. Those who do will be given pardon and an option to make a name for themselves in a more honorable Rome via military service. Those who do not will find no shelter from the wrath of God for this betrayal of Christianity.This message will be punctuated by an aggressive siege complete with funded siege engines aiming to show the sheer futility of fighting back. Onagers will assault the walls and remove the sense of security the Romans have in their city while traction trebuchets will assault the proper defenses and defenders themselves aiming to beat the morale out of the army in a mighty show of force. The goal is to achieve capitulation as quickly as possible without storming the city this season.,IronPowers,dbkgfow,1,t5_3giah
