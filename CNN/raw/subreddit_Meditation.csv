10264,0,t3_1u84re,The goal is not to calm your thoughts or body sensations. The goal is to passively observe. You will get sucked up in thoughts and when you become aware of it happening redirect your attention to the breath. By merely being aware of what is happening and accepting it you will eventually begin to ease in to a calmer state. Your brain is still an organ like anything else. It doesnt change overnight but slowly over the course of several months through daily exercise. ,Meditation,ceflqjv,1,t5_2qnc9

You perhaps have unlocked some emotions even you didnt know existed.  The tears can feel like warm water falling down your face with or without crying.  My advice is to be in it fully.

20567,0,t1_cegogjq,Yes its all illusion but in that illusion we should act with correct relationship.The Seven Points Of Mind Training offer the aphorismgt After meditation be a child of illusion.In meditation we can keep a pure mind of choiceless awareness. But after meditation we need to relate to people and make decisions. Once you become a Buddha the decisionmaking process will not have associated traces of selfimage or a sense of self and in fact if you keep a clear mind many of the socalled decisions arise like you say they just seem to happen. But there is a difference between the flow of life that just seems to happen because your mind and heart are clear and go with the flow choices based on a personal philosophy or appearing from unconscious habitual reactions.We can for instance take a stand against injustice or abuse.There is no need to wrap your head around the notion of noself. The correct understanding is the activity itself. There is no thing you need to hold on to. Only act sincerely moment to moment.Keep a simple sincere mind and everything is enough as it is.Another way of considering it is this whether there is self or whether there is no self just now you are reading these words. So there is a truth beyond our ideas. When you participate in reading you participate as universal truth. It is not special it is very plain and simple. When you walk when you see the crescent of the moon and the pale disc behind it when you taste a clementine when you hear someone calling your name  all this is universal truth all this is enough.If someone offers you a moldy tomato you dont have to eat it. Whether you call this a decision or not and whether you think of it as arising from a self or not the upshot is that no thanks can appear. You decline to eat it because it can harm you. How will you help yourself and others if you die?The Bodhisattva does not for a moment embrace the illusion that sentient beings exist. But the Bodhisattva does not for a moment fail to respond to the suffering of sentient beings.Go figure.,Meditation,cegrwav,2,t5_2qnc9

No religious nonsense. No there is no goal nonsense.In short Insight is about paying very close attention to all sensations and thoughts.

86093,0,t1_ceo7eqd,Permanently involves time. You cant do something for the rest of forever... you can only do something now. So as something arises for us in the present we accept it and then let it go. We accept fully that it is arising but we then detach from it. The comparison is often made between clouds and thoughts. We just let the thought pass like a cloud drifting by in the sky. Acceptance is important as it actually makes us more available for the uncomfortable feelings that the ego often avoids. Through a practice of acceptance we become less and less hijacked by thoughts and feelings which actually allows us the space to understand them better. Letting go is this same attitude actually  maybe just in reverse. Having allowed the thought or emotion fully into our experience through acceptance we then relax and let it drift away. If we experience residual thoughts afterwards we accept those also and then let them drift away. Acceptance and letting go actually are just different ways of describing the same thing a loosening of the ego. Forget about the future. You actually cant control what youll do tomorrow despite what your mind will tell you. You can only act now in this moment. Thats where the acceptance and letting go occurs nowhere else. ,Meditation,ceo8bbr,6,t5_2qnc9

98857,0,t3_1v7zlr,gt I found the latter leaves me in some trancelike state which is calmly and focused.See you know what focus is.  Both vipassana and samatha require focus attention on an object but they utilize different objects.  As you probably know samatha is focus on the breath while vipassana is focus on the changing nature of all sensations that arise. If vipassana feels weak maybe you are being lazy with your focus?  Are you staying with the sensations as they arise and pass away?  Its probably a lot harder than you think and indeed your focus can be strong in this activity. If that is very difficult one can start with samatha to build a strong concentration and then move to vipassana.  Can you be with just the breath for a full minute?  If not try using samatha to build a foundation for insight practice.  ,Meditation,cepoo03,3,t5_2qnc9

These are the ones I learnedMay I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm.May I be happy and find joy in this moment as it is.May I be healthy and physically strong.May I be peaceful and live with ease.But for example I changed the wording on healthy and physically strong at first because this affirmation felt guiltinducing for a long time.

111948,0,t3_1v3zs5,I havent really used them for meditation but I have used them. I used them in college for a while trying to get some off the advertised benefits but I couldnt really definitively say the advertised benefits worked or not. However...Recently many things have been really bothering me. I have been married for almost a year now. Lately I have been thinking a lot about the many things I do NOT have in common with my wife and it stresses me out.  Since November weve hosted three parties at our house and I feel like I did most of the work to make it presentable and most of the work to restore it after further stressing me out. I felt like it wasnt fair.  Ive got things I want to take care of projects Id like to do yet I have to spend all of my free time to personally take care of all the things that I feel we both have to take care of. More stress. I had troubles remembering things I said Id do upcoming birthdays and such making more stress. Ive been putting on weight mostly due to neglecting training for the halfmarathon Im running in March. Stress stress stress.Out of the blue this past weekend I felt like listening to binaural beats again. About five minutes in my brain felt a  weird sort of pain  it wasnt really a headache. Looking back on it I would liken the feeling to anticipation like watching a hose with a kink in it as the power of the water finally straightens the hose. Suddenly I felt good. Like really good. I thought the beats were making me feel happy at first but as my brain started to loosen up I realized it wasnt happiness it was relief.Now Ive been talking smiling laughing and joking with my wife. Sunday I went for a run. I ran an extra mile farther than I planned to. Monday night is bowling night and I was finally able to learn how to throw my new ball and got about  pins more than my average night. Tuesday night is team trivia night and for the first time I was the mvp on my team and we won.I find myself planning time to take care of the projects that I want to do. I know what events I have coming up this weekend.  My dad who I carpool with notices Im in a better mood and asked me why I am suddenly a morning person.Ive read that the beats synchronize the halves of your brain so they communicate better and can help your brain establish pathways to function specific ways easier. I would guess that my stress was leading to poor communication and therefore could not function the way I wanted it to. And it had been compounding  the poor communication was creating situations that would add more stress.I listened to an hz binaural beat which corresponds to what they call beta waves. Google can tell you what scientists believe beta waves correspond to in brain function. I would personally say that since listening my brain is certainly performing beta functions better. If you want help meditating it could very well help you to use whatever frequency is appropriate but dont expect the sound to automatically make you meditate. You notice that in my examples I wasnt doing beta waves I was bowling going trivia etc. The waves dont do those things I do. What Im trying to say is meditation is something you can do at those frequencies but those frequencies dont necessarily mean meditation. It is still something you have to actively do. The binaural beats only help your brain establish the infrastructure to do something.Imagine a skyscraper in New York. If it were empty it would be useless no point. However if several businesses come in and use the office space a lot of work can be done. Binaural beats can help your brain build the skyscraper but you need to be the businesses actively working to get work done.In my experience the beats have wonderful antianxiety properties and no skeptic will ever be able to convince me it was a placebo.

158596,0,t1_cew27oz,While it is true that different meditations work for different people leaving it open ended leads to confusion because of the problem of too many choices. If there are many different techniques of meditation notwithstanding many interpretations of those meditations this is confusing as fuck. Its tantamount to telling someone to oh just be yourself. Or better you just gotta love yourself! Its just platitudes.What a beginner needs is a simple categorization of the major types of meditations and a loose summary of what they are about. There are theoretically infinitely many meditations but most of them fall under a few categories. Furthermore humanity knows of some particularly powerful meditations Vipassana Dzogchen Deity yoga which is impossible to get information on heavenly abodes etc. plus all different types. Im focusing on Buddhism but for the most part if one actually wants success you need to start shadowing what has been done and then start doing your own thing. You might like being told to shut the fuck up and sit but that is terrible advice for most people. Like almost everyone fails at meditation either because they dont really care to meditate or the spiritualreligious culture in which meditation is usually embedded in sucks a load of camel cum because they arent given clear instruction on how or why even to practice.And I think its more recommended a beginner learn from respected teachers with a history of not being an emotional fucktard which with local random spiritual circles for a beginner who knows what youll walk into a goldmine or a cult?,Meditation,cewhwbr,5,t5_2qnc9

This can be done BUT you will have to trust me for it to work OK?Here is what to do. Im giving you permission to meditate in a different way.  So to start this new way you need to forget....let go....of all the ideas you have had about how it is supposed to be.  That means to set all the ideas you learned about how to meditate aside and only follow my instructions. Set the timer for  minutes. Lie down on your back. Make your self comfortable. Start the timer. Breathe in through your nose smoothly and deeply. Breath out through your mouth. amp  not rapidly and not too deeply but smooth and a little deep Try and feel imagine feeling warmth and even love in the center of your chest. Keep doing this until the alarm sounds telling you the  minutes are done. Set the timer for  minutes.  Adjust yourself to be as comfortable as possible still lying on your back. Start the timer and do like soThe object of your meditation works best if it is only one tiny area of sensation. For this reason use the rims of your nostrils. Focus all of your attention exclusively upon that tiny area and no where else. Breathe only through your nose and focus intently upon the sensation of the breath as it passes over the rims of the nostrils.When you become aware that any thoughtfeelingimage has drawn your attention away from the object the sensation at the nostrils of your meditation return your full attention back to the object. Do not become agitated do not scold yourself...try as best you can to calmly return your full attention back upon the object.There are absolutely no special thoughtsfeelingsimages. No anything that arises into your awareness must be treated exactly the same no matter how blissfully fascinating or disgustingly abhorrent....while practicing meditation your one job is to calmly return your full attention back to the object of your meditation.When the alarm sounds you can stop. Try that a few times and let me know how it goes OK?  Then we will adjust things as needed.,Meditation,ceye0xy,1,t5_2qnc9

205468,0,t3_1wb447,Sitting meditation and standing chi gung zhan zhuang require similar skills and do some similar things for you but they are not the same and you cant just substitute one for the other without effect.The goal of zhan zhuang is primarily to remove blockages in the body and etheric energy body chi and increase the practitioners root and internal power. The standing postures place more physical demands on the body and force chi to circulate strongly especially through the legs. Standing is great for robust physical health and strength but it wont do as much for the mind and emotions.Seated meditation allows the practitioner to penetrate deeper and work with the energies of the emotions and the mind but it doesnt circulate energy to the same degree as standing and wont building the same type of physical power.Bruce Frantzis who studied with many Daoist masters says in his books that less experienced practitioners should use standing postures first to dissolves blockages in the physical body then after those are taken care of move into sitting and lying postures to work at deeper levels.Personally at this point in my practice  years in I spend probably  of my practice time standing  sitting.,Meditation,cf1uhe9,2,t5_2qnc9

212836,0,t3_1wjvsq,There are many alternatives. It depends somewhat on where you can get to.Most true retreats  Vipassana or otherwise  will have a schedule and structure that youre expected to follow. This helps you. It helps you to focus on the work you came to do rather than be swayed here and there by your fleeting whims and trepidations. It also helps you to understand your karma with a clear structure you see better where your mind tends go.Many centers will though offer other experiences like day or weekend workshops or introductory courses. Some workshops teach the centers particular style while others may give a taste of alternatives.In some hubs you can combine learning with a sort of spa vacation but they tend not to be places where you can continue the study or contact with the teacher  the teacher drops in for a weekend or week or possibly monthlong experience.

274456,0,t3_1x8r1z,Hello ascherjgtI have made it a goal of mine to sit everyday even if it is for five minutes.Yea!!  Good for you.   gtis there a default type of meditation that is usually practiced by most? Would it be mindfulness meditation? That is the type of meditation I believed was meditation before I was introduced to the term.There is no default type.  But there is one thing that all effective methods of meditation have in common.  That is developing the skill of concentration.  The degree to which a person will benefit from any type of meditation is directly proportionate to their skill level in concentration.  Some of the other factors that directly impact how effective your practice will be areA How clearlycompletely you understand the precise instructions.B How close the way you practice is to the instructions.C How long your meditation sessions are.D How often you practice.E How motivated you are to practice diligently.In order to practice mindfulness effectively you need to hone your skill of concentration.  If you are concentrating on A sensation of the breath as the object then your job is to return your attention to that object while in meditation.  Part of that job is to remain calm when you happen to become aware your mind has wandered and gently amp immediately return your concentration to the object.  Through this process you learn to view all thoughtsfeelingsimages that happen to be present when you suddenly become aware that your mind has wandered as absolutely equal.  You learn that there are no special thoughtsfeelingsimages.  Learning this cultivates the quality of equanimity which is essential for progressing further into meditative states of consciousness.Edit spelling,Meditation,cf97k5a,0,t5_2qnc9

You do not have to be particularly religious in order to really enter deeply into a meditative state as long as you are following the rules. These are contained in the eight limbs of Raja yoga although they arent specific to that religion rather they are just universal scientific rules on meditation based on the law that makes science possible cause and effect being able to repeat something by causing certain specific conditions.The issue that you may have is that you have defined yourself as an atheist or whatever and that is going to cause problems when it comes to trying to obtain a non dualistic perspective which is precisely what you will want in order to relax and rest because the cause of stress is conflict of any kind.

But thats changing as more common Christians in the US take up mindfulness meditation and yoga and dont see it as contradictory. Christianity and contemplation had a long history together from its genesis until the Reformation really. Several theologians like Aquinas and Tillich said that God IS Being as opposed to a being. Augustine was a mystic. He had a really good piece in Confessions about going inside to the eye of the soul... Ill have to find it again. And dont forget heretics like Eckhart.

346291,0,t1_cfgnbxs,Thats strange now that you mention it I feel the same way too. I once went to a class for a style of meditation which I have forgotten the name of but but the instructor spoke about something that struck a chord for me. She said sometimes when you avoid meditation throughout the day and you go to sleep you might wake up about  hours later. This is due to a spiritual buildup and you feel energized because you need to sit down and clear out the clutter. Its actually the best time to meditate. So my train of thought now is if you meditate or a long amount of time then when you fall asleep it becomes a deeper slumber than youre used to and as such the dream becomes more lucid. ,Meditation,cfgnu3g,1,t5_2qnc9

364221,0,t1_cfhuw9z,Hi friend.  First of all I meant no disrespect.But if Im being purely pragmatic I would definitely say past and future events are outside of reality.  And I wouldnt say they dont affect you at all.  In fact Id argue the opposite.  Your current body composition and mindset is the result of everything youve consumed and experienced up until now.  Also I am in no way marginalizing chemical imbalances.  My sister suffers from them greatly as does her children.  Ive battle depression from my teens through my mid s.  Today I still have a crippling social anxiety.  Even pseudoanonymous conversation on reddit gets me all in a tizzy.However over the years Ive overcome a lot of my mental distresses and found a great comfort in not just accepting but owning my situation and trying to be as pragmatic as possible.  Part of that was looking at myself in a macrosense and recognizing the recursive patterns of depression and anxiety meditation was a great tool for this.  Then realizing that the things I have actual control over are simply my choices.  I began taking health into my own hands and have had great success.  Now Im not saying everyone can do it just that I did.  The end result was a mindset conducive of OPs post.  It wasnt the answer it was the outcome.  So to stay with your analogy I decided to learn the Heimlich and apply it to myself.  I know its tough.  Its super tough but all problems have a solution.,Meditation,cfiimgr,1,t5_2qnc9

I think what would help further is removing the time references Eckhart Tolle says a lot of stuff about this. Try not to think Its pm and Ive not had a smoke for x hours or Ill put it off until later because there is a still a sense of desire in that statement like you are saving up for a big treat.On another note and I hope I dont come across as lecturing but I was a regular smoker for many years if I had any in the house I will smoke that shit till its gone but I just got bored of it. I realised that I had been deluding myself thinking the things that I felt were its positives relaxing appreciating music etc more were something I needed and I found the negatives lethargy overeating paranoia occasional panicattacks to really not be worth it and I dont miss it at all now.

449729,0,t3_1z8581,Im not interested in trying to convince you or anyone about what a consistent practice of meditation can result in.  But I am happy to give you simple step by step instructions for practicing a method of Mindfulness meditation. Get settled in make yourself comfortable. It doesnt really matter how you sit as long as you are sitting in a stable position and that your back is held straight not rigid...only held firmly. Press the start button on the timer. Once the session starts you must not move the body in any way or influence the way the body happens to breathe. Concentrate all of your attention on the rims of your nostrils concentrate on the sensation of the breath passing over. Only breathe through your nose. When you happen to become aware that your mind has wandered calmly amp immediately return your attentionconcentration back upon the object the sensations at the rims of the nostrils. The alarm sounds and you are done.It may appear that this is all about concentrating on the object and trying to not let your mind wander no? Well that is part of it but the key is through practicing coming to learn how to remain calm when you happen to notice your mind has wandered.In general it is best to start with short sessions probably  minutes or less.  Then as your skills improve you can gradually lengthen the sessions.  Half an hour of consistent daily practice is about the minimum most people need to experience any sort of tangible results.

The quoted part below makes me feel like its either him or me that is doing this completely wrong. gtMindfulness requires selfobservation and selfobservation is exhausting. You have to sit and pay attention to everything. How youre breathing what your postures like what youre thinking about why youre thinking about it what to do because youre thinking about whatever youre thinking. It goes on and on.gtPlus mindfulness makes me neurotic. One exercise I did involved writing down every thought that passed through my mind over the course of half an hour. This taught me that I was worried about work. I didnt know I had been worried about work but the knowledge sent me into a panicky death spiral.

455813,0,t1_cfs12rz,This idea is something that descartes describes.  What we see is not the true essence of an object.  We project ourselves upon everything we see and experience.  Think about it this way when you see a table or a chair you see a concept you probably dont even recognize the individual aspects to that particular object.  This isnt an exact definition but a guide to what im trying to show you.  You see the world with your own preconceptions and on top of that your emotional being mental understanding etc is projected upon your experience of the world.  This isnt to say that there isnt a chair or a table but rather what we see are what descartes describes as shades of the truth.  The reason why we can assume this is because if there wasnt a chair there then what is it that im perceiving?  It is a shade of the truth and ultimately we have to accept that aspect of our perception of the world around us or else wed be blinded to the fact that we are not perfect beings capable of knowing the truth of things.

670487,0,t1_cggfd5k,Social skills is a very general term. Would I say meditation has made me into a better actor able to fool people manipulate and trick them very convincingly while giving me very high skills for longterm and complex planning? Sure. Ever since I started meditating my social life decreased in activity and would always get irritated when people interrupted my meditation prompting me to realize that if I wanted to succeed long term I would need to move out to live on my own as quickly as possible. My parents always said I had poor social skills because I didnt like to talk to people. I generally find the idea of small talk very timewasting and dislike it generally. My mind is always focused on some goal. I am very good at navigating conversations and engaging with people when I have an explicit endgoal of some sort in mind though I do not enjoy very much random small talk. This doesnt mean I am always manipulating someone when I talk to them on the contrary I just try not to waste time in general. When it comes to unavoidable of necessarily conversations I am generally able to portray an image exactly as I have it imagined in my head.I have developed a great sensitivity to reading other people based off slight movements they make very subtle social cues. Its not an intentional thing but my subconscious naturally processes these things and makes me aware of them. I can for instance almost immediately get a pretty good idea of the psychologicalemotional composure of a persons mind based on how they move how they speak spaces in words pauses in speaking emotion in voice. So much so to the extent that I can with high accuracy predict how they will respond to various stimuli. This of course can make it very easy to manipulate people to be able to predict their various responses but its not something I have a major interest in abusing as of right now. The skills and abilities gained in meditation have a near infinite amount of uses this sort of social awareness is only one small part of it all.Instead of focusing specifically on this elevated social awareness try to imagine what it stems from. From meditation I am simply naturally more aware of my subconscious processes. This translates to higher awareness precision control accuracy complexity of processing in nearly all tasks. There is a reason many yogis say meditation is a conscious evolution of human spirit. This is the concept behind the yoga sutras. What marks our evolution as humans is not much of our physical shape but what is happening cognitively. People think we arent evolving anymore but I think this is entirely untrue. We evolve on mental levels. Our society is highly cognitively demanding. Successful people with minds that enable success will inevitably have higher chances at reproducing in this society so based off this theory highcognitive functions are an evolutionary favored trait. There are amazing skills that our brains are capable of that very few humans have even attempted to imagine. SpiritualMental evolution which given the capacity of the brain can reach near infinite potential allowing for such a human to result that is capable of performing and cognitive or cognitivebased task with very precision and ridiculously high levels of calculative complexity. The Yoga Sutras and many other Yogic texts have talked on this and many highly attained yogis have demonstrated skills that would be indicative of this fact. Generally speaking in the grand scheme of things most . of humans are still incredibly primitive. Meaning if you were to label intelligencecognitive performance on a scale of  to billion we are probably somewhere around . Of course this is just a random number but it is a very likely guestimation to how undeveloped our intelligences are. Though while our intelligences are highly undeveloped the speed at which they can be developed through proper meditation is phenomenal. One yogi once claimed that if our intelligences were to evolve naturally it was take close to a billion years of generations to reach the level that a meditator could attain in a single life time if they practiced correctly. While many spiritual teachers have said meditation is what society needs to become more spiritual it is inexplicitly implied that spiritual development is essentially cognitive development on some level. Perhaps if people realized this they would be less put off by the word spiritual and more attracted by the intelligence enhancement. ,Meditation,cgghf58,5,t5_2qnc9

Go to any club or college and youll find that the men who are most successful with women are the ones that have those traits.To problem though is that men are not taught to develop those traits. We stuff children with carbs and park them in front of TVs rather than teaching them how to eat mindfully and exercise. Just look at our obesity statistics. I cant blame a  year old kid who weighs  pounds because his idiot mother stuffed him full of twinkies every day. I want to show that kid how to make improvements in his life.People who actually possess those qualities heres where we differ. I believe it qualities such as charisma fitness attractiveness etc can be developed and improved by every man. Theres nothing stopping women from going after those guys.

She my teacher made it clear to me that there was no process...no steps to be taken in a sequential manner.  She explained it in such a way that I came have confidence that she was completely correct and so I followed her instructions with a passion.What she taught me and what I came to know through practicing as she taught me was that either I am grasping on to a thoughtsensationimage or I am not.There is no middle ground or steps or a process of ungrasping. It is like a light switch being in either the on or off position.  The feeling that something more needs to be done or searching for a reaction in the body are no different than any other sort of thinking.  All of that is the egomind seeking to justify itself.

795948,0,t3_237v4r,gt Susan began our journey by leading us in meditation or doing shamata.  This is a form of Tibetan Buddhist meditation that involves sitting meditation and a onepointed approach.  By putting attention onepointed on your breath while you sit you allow for spaciousness of the mind to open up in doing so you also give yourself the freedom to have any emotions thoughts or worries.gt The work is not about being a blank slate and pushing yourself to let go of emotions.  It is actually the opposite its about finding a gentleness in yourself a softening of the heart and an acceptance of any emotion or thought that you may possess.Rang true to me. And thisgt With this daily routine of meditation I found that I could see what I was doing in my work in a more clear and precise way and I found that if one day I didnt write at all I didnt panic.  And because of this the next day I would be a flowing stream of words and thoughts and ideas.   In Chogyam Trungpas The Myth of Freedom he says Meditation is working with our speed our restlessness our constant busyness.  Meditation provides space or ground in which restlessness might function might have room to be restless might relax by being restless.  gt I find this paradox so insightful in that through the acceptance of ourselves we are able to find the other parts of ourselves by me accepting my unfocused self one day I found focus the next day.

807105,0,t1_cgvmu7e,I should have stated One goal of meditation is to refrain from normal thought processes and to clear ones mind When the particle is being measured it responds accordingly but could the particle somehow understand that it is being observed without the presence of measurement equipment? I understand your point about the measuring tools but the DSE couldnt conclude why the particles responded the way that they did. Whos to say that the particle is not conscious itself and that when it understands that it is being observed it changes its reaction.The measuring devices used in the DSE alerted the particle that it should respond in a certain way but what if there was a way to observe that particle without equipment... If consciousness alone could identify these particles could that affect the behavior of these particles?The DSE claims that the particle can be shot through two slits at once thus being in two places at one point in time So it does claim that a particle can exist at multiple points at the same time.I appreciate your feedback and the quantum world is far too complex for us to understand Im just making an attempt at doing so.

Generally shallow breathing can in fact alleviate stress very well and in deep concentration states the breath will naturally become very shallow if you dont control it. However if you feel like its not giving you good results then theres nothing wrong with trying something else. Another benefit of focusing on the nostril tip is that the feeling is very subtle so youll have to work harder to stay focused on it.

1019972,0,t1_chk4lkp,I can really identify with this and have been working on being less riskaverse in my own life. Hopefully some of the things I have been trying will be helpful to you.I try to think about how I will feel if I dont do something and especially think about regret. I only have one life and at the end of it I dont think Ill ever say to myself I wish Id watched more TVstayed in morehelped fewer peoplebeen less healthy. I want to act on my values I want to help people I want to do things I love I want to feel good I want to have wonderful memories to look back on.Related to this is actively trying to become the best version of myself I can be. What makes me feel awake and engaged? What feels like me? What are my particular talents and how can I use them in ways that Im passionate about? I really like your simile about your mind being like a childparent. I have been someone who beats myself up a lot but am trying to be more conscious of this. After all I would never talk to someone I love the way I talk to myself sometimes or treat a child like that. So I try to make a conscious effort to be tender and forgiving of myself to tell myself I love you encourage myself to do things that are good for me but in a loving way. I try to catch myself having critical or negative thoughts and soothe and soothe and reassure myself.So maybe if you are a strict overprotective parent to yourself consciously try to change that role? Say to yourself Even though this is scary I want you to have a full happy life. I love you and I trust you to take on new things and deal with the risks as they arise.And if youve gotten out of the habit of taking risks try to start incorporating them back into your life. When theres something you want to do notice how that makes you feel and how those feelings change when you start listing whatifs. Theres the idea and the initial excitement. But then theres the stage where you start thinking about things that could go wrong and in my experience that comes with a constrained deflated feeling thats very unpleasant. I dont think its necessarily a bad thing to analyze risks. But go a step further. Of the risks you imagine how likely are they? Are they within your control? How long would they effect you and how could you recover if any of them happened? Then write it all down so that if your mind starts to dwell on it you can say Ive already thought about all that and I dont need to spend any more time on it. And then concentrate on all the positives in the same way. List all the reasons you want to do . Let yourself get excited about it. List the ways it will benefit you enrich you make you happy. What are you looking forward to? How will you feel if you do this? What other opportunities will this open up for you? How will you feel if you dont do it? Then try your best to notice the excitement along with the hesitation and go for it! If things go well notice how that feels and enjoy it. If things dont go as planned figure out what you can learn from them and do what is in your power to change. Let go of anything that you cant control. If you catch yourself worrying remind yourself what you enjoy about what youre doing and focus on those things. Writing has been a really valuable tool for me. Writing down negative things keeps me from fixating on them and writing down positive things helps me remember them. Doesnt need to be fancy lists work well. Anyway I cant sleep so here I am writing a whole novel. But rambling as it is I hope there is something in there that helps. Take care ,Meditation,chk87rc,1,t5_2qnc9

1040942,0,t3_260rjh,Rajyoga is another way of spelling Raja Yoga which literally means Royal Yoga or Kings Yoga identifying it as the highest of yogic paths. There are a few different connotations of the term as regards different systems or points of view through the history of yoga but in general it refers to yoga of the mind.Mind is the precursor of everything. Everything comes from mind. So awakening to the true nature of mind is seen as the direct route beyond techniques religions and dogmas. The way Raja Yoga is generally taught though may involve various techniques within a philosophical or religious framework.The central practice is meditation. Selfinquiry  seeking out ones own mind  is an example of a Raja Yoga practice. This method was taught by Sri Ramana Maharshi among others. Some schools may use a concentrationbased method but concentration alone cant bring about enlightenment so it is necessarily paired with other practices.In any case although meditation is central there are several other limbs of Raja Yoga training including several rules of ethical conduct several areas of character development and supplementary training like asana posture and pranayama breath training. The ethical and character training are necessary because stability of mind is impossible if ones behavior is improper or negative. Training of posture and breath enhance the meditative process speeding progress and making longer meditation sessions possible.If you are drawn to Raja Yoga I recommend researching selfinquiry practice. The school established by Sri Ramana Maharshi is still in operation and if you are not tied to the Hinduyoga culture many schools of Zen teach selfinquiry leading to enlightenment.FYI the term is sometimes also written as Rajah Yoga and selfinquiry is sometimes called selfenquiry or immoko.,Meditation,chmlybr,4,t5_2qnc9
1044188,0,t3_261srn,Im reading Mindfulness Bliss and Beyond by Ajahn Brahm at the moment. He has some helpful advice on this issue. He says that mindfulness of the breath is a more advanced stage than the experience of the mind in silent awareness of the present. You ought to develop the faculties of just sitting being aware of all sensory and thought processes without judgement or action i.e. moving to get more comfortable or following a train of thought.  Then you can move on to being mindful of the breath. Jumping ahead will lead to frustration. Ive been meditating for a couple of years and I often have days where I cant seem to focus at on the breath. I think he has a point. Now when I start off just being aware of the present then I relax a lot and can move on to the breath.Good luck ,Meditation,chmz8x5,4,t5_2qnc9

1123025,0,t3_26y974,This is where having a community to practice with and compare experiences to really helps.  The sort of experience youre describing is extremely normal.  Id really recommend joining a meditation practice group where you can talk a little bit about some of these experiences.gtIm not happy with how I look even after  years of bodybuilding. Im not happy with who I am even tho I tricked myself that I am for  years. gtSuddenly I feel like I dont even know who I am.So as far as bthis is one of the most common insight experiences in meditation.  We pull back the curtains so to speak and see that there isnt a person behind the scenes orchestrating our actions theyre largely reactiveeither pleasuredriven or aversive.  This is the beginning of the insight that there is no self.  Its not a bad thingthe flip side of this is realizing the freedom we have to act outside of what we thought was our nature but doesnt really exist.As far as a goes there are two potential explanations.  First these unhappy thoughts might not really have any actual substanceits just that you didnt notice them before but theyre not fundamentally different from any of the other stimuli you notice while meditatinglike your aching back or hunger because you didnt eat enough this morning.The second explanation is that you realize how empty these things were for you and how they didnt really give you what you were looking for.But the important thing is to be skeptical both ways.  Just as you might realize that some of your good thoughts had no real substance the same is largely true of the bad thoughts youre noticing cropping up.In my experience people come from one of two places when meditatingeither an extroverted place or an introverted place.  If youre coming from an extroverted outlook you might normally feel that everythings alright except for stress and craziness and discover through meditation that you were covering up a lot of insecurities that you never noticed before.  If youre coming from an introverted place you might normally feel sort of out of control and like youre doing something wrong but discover during meditation that your constant doubts and worries have no real substance and there are things about you that are fundamentally right that youre comfortable with.But the insight of both people is correctjust not in the way theyre thinking.  Its correct in that all these value thoughts have no real substance.  The extrovert isnt wrong in thinking his life is ok and the introvert isnt wrong in thinking there are genuine sources of dissatisfaction in his life.  Theyre both wrong in attaching too much important to these sort of selfimage thoughts.,Meditation,chvy5sz,2,t5_2qnc9
1137387,0,t3_274zlf,If you are initially building your practice shorter times and more frequent intervals is my advice until you develop a habit ie consistently ramp it up over a month. Having said that you want to meditate for longer sessions to further your practice. It is imperative for the insight that meditation delivers in understanding your mind your thoughts and the autopilot behavior and reactions you exhibit to them and to ultimately break those cycles. I am also a firm believer in still doing short sessions throughout  your day as well but not at the expense of longer sessions and trying to bring mindfulness into your activities when you arent sitting. But to answer your question you ultimately want to be doing sessions that are at least  minutes long on a consistent basis.One other comment  you said dont have a lot of time for it. That brings up the question why are you meditating? What has brought you here what do you hope to get from it?

At the start of every class she would always stress that it isnt a competitive activity where you measure yourself against others.  She was very against measuring peoples progress or success as it wasnt about either of those.  It was about mastering the techniques and gaining benefit both physically and mentally.  I think the same is true with meditation.  While Im gaining benefit and learning something about myself and the techniques I feel motivated to continue with it.

1234757,0,t1_ci8guan,Religion is a vast vast topic of study. It covers a multitude of ideas and a myriad of opinions on what those ideas actually signify. But lets narrow it down. Lets take... oh say Christian Eschatology. Eschatology is the theological word for the study of the so called endtimes. The time when Christ will return in glory and all wrong will be right and the dead will be resurrected and judged by God and those who pass will spend eternity in the Kingdom of God as full sons and daughters of God in new bodies on a new earth that has merged with a new heaven and those who dont wont. Yay God. Alright that is the basics. Pretty much what you said. Lots of waiting for the future and then lots of death and judgment then paradise and happiness for the good guys which just happen to be us. It is something that really cannot be gotten around if one is a Christian. It is in the bible it is in the creeds outline statements of belief and forms the entire last chapter of the story of redemption in Christianity. Fine. Alright. Cool. So how do I as a Christian and a mediator work this out with the lived experience of the paradisaical nature of the present moment? How do I talk about it to people who sincerely pin all their hopes on this literally happening?I scale it down first of all. There are many ways to take the story of redemption of Christianity and the most helpful way is to take it personally to be about my creation my fall which necessitates my death my judgement and my resurrection. Alright still sounds pretty bad. But when I start meditating and really investigating all this I see a pattern which is my who is the me that is created falls dies is judged and who is resurrected? Also when does this happen? When is eternity anyways? Lets start with the last. Eternity on even the briefest investigation is right now. Whether a short now or a long now it is always now. So... when does this whole thing happen? Now. Well that is not helpful it is still a story and stories happen over time. So I can ask myself where in this story right now am I? Lets say I am in a fallen state. Alright what is a fallen state? Lets say I am really pissed off at my cat for no good reason. Fine anger then I meditate and look into and and the whole thing is silly so I start laughing and the anger dies. Me as the anger? dead. It is no more. It has passed on. It has kicked the bucket bought the farm joined the bleeding choir invisible. This is an exanger. But there is no void where the anger was. There is laughter and love towards my cat. I have been resurrected now and am living now in the kingdom of god as I pet my cat. This is the thing creation fall death and resurrection are happening all the time now. Judgement is happening all the time now. Paradise the Kingdom of God is available Now. It is the first teaching of Jesus The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand repent and believe the good news. Mark  If each of us can move through the entire story each moment there is no problem and the endtimes if it physically actually happens will take care of itself. Because it has already happened is complete and here we are anyways.It is because of meditation that I can see it this way. I have a piece of calligraphy from Thich Nhat Hanh on my wall that reads The Kingdom of God is now or never. which is a manifestation of the same insight.I dont mean to preach here. It is just how I reconcile this issue in my own head. There are many other ways to take Christian Eschatology and you certainly dont have to buy into it if you are not a Christian anyways. But it can be reconciled with meditation practice and insights. I hoped this actually helped and in some way made sense. But if not we can always start again! ,Meditation,ci8izdp,3,t5_2qnc9

Ive had problems with depersonalisation as part of my anxiety and it was one of the things Id hope to help eventually with meditation  annoying that so far its made it worse. Im after that heightened acts and peaceful goal.Im using headspace which is a  min guided beginner audio session goes over breathing and also listening to sounds feeling surrounding touch sensations. I dont get boredom quite the opposite oddly I feel as though I get no thoughts at all  without trying or anything I can quite happily focus on just counting or breathing and I enjoy the act of meditation its relaxing and nice but I just get odd dizziness and panic afterwards. Maybe going from the meditation back to normal stuff the day after? Im really not sure I was just hoping someone else experienced this briefly before it faded and the effects of the meditation Id hoped for became more noticeable.

1287879,0,t3_28u37i,Im not really someone who mediates in the traditional sense. However I do meditate just before I go to sleep by just laying on my back on my bed.Your experience is pretty similar in nature to mine though... I think because Im usually already tired before I sleep I can let my mind go a bit easier. There have been a few times where just before I fall asleep I experience pretty much the same thing you described. The best way I can explain it is like.. you know when you close your eyes and you still know youre looking at the back of your eyelids? Well it basically feels like youre no longer looking at anything anymore and your perception sort of shifts more towards like a large black void  like it literally feels as though your sphere of perception is expanding in all directions.I usually snap out of it pretty quickly  like a few seconds but I feel pretty sublime when it happens. Just my c! Not too sure if I would consider it a spiritual experience  but spiritual is pretty subjective so if it felt like it for you then it probably was. ,Meditation,ciei43x,3,t5_2qnc9
1309085,0,t3_292fup,It is interesting that the phrase dark night that is being referenced borrows from the Christian Saint John of the Cross yet most the article revolves around WesternBuddhist meditation and its practice anchored within Eastern religious texts.Meditation is nothing new in the west. In fact mindfulness and meditation was a key feature of Christian Mysticism dating back to the th century and even arguably before given the accounts of the desert fathers. Despite the churchs opinion on which mystics got it right and which ones got it wrong there is little doubt they had profound effects on Christianity in general see Saint Francis of Assisi. Yet the kind of darknessalthough not always seen this wayin meditation being discussed here is also nothing new when you begin to read into this various histories of Christianity such as Marie of Oignies or The Cloud of Unknowing.Perhaps it has something to do with Christian Fundamentalist frameworks in America that have diminished the need for serious contemplation over religious texts even the outright refusal for texts other than the Bible. Perhaps it is related to the migration of Eastern cultures and practices. But meditation is something that has always been within Western culture and its religious practices with plenty of literature discussing proper techniques of practice. I would hope at the very least the people leading this project are consulting experts and acknowledging the literature within Western mysticism in case we forgot  years of Christian history.,Meditation,cigvzxh,6,t5_2qnc9

1362012,0,t3_29oizx,I view Hatha yoga as just a moving meditation the real benefit of it is using the body and the breath as the object of focus. I think many find this easier than watching something more subtle like their thoughts.  With that in mind it doesnt really matter IMO if you can do the poses perfectly. It matters if you are focused and doing the movement with your breath. Thats my take Im sure some yoga people might disagree.  When you say you are unable to do the movements are you not able to bend over at all? Can you switch between down dog and up dog? What are you looking for in yoga?,Meditation,cin0nfm,1,t5_2qnc9
1367987,0,t3_29r87x,I USED to have this problem quit a bit actually but my ideas about meditation have changed quite a bit since then and that was only maybe about  months ago.  I think I had started reading Mindfulness in Plain English around that time and I personally think this text and a lot of other Buddhistmindfulness texts focus on watching emotions and thoughts.  I did this for a long time and always kind of disliked the dissociated feeling I got from it almost like apathy or uncaring.  Now I focus more on feeling the emotions sitting with it embracing it accepting it.  Essentially I throw myself into the midst of the emotion to fully feel it.  I never really liked the term watching your feelings. Watching my thoughts always had good results for me because my thoughts tend to not be very productive or real or good for me in most any way but embracing and fully feeling my emotions seems to have done much more good for me rather than watching my emotions.  ,Meditation,cinrl1m,1,t5_2qnc9

1397670,0,t1_cirh3ya,Please please please I beg you never ever believe an illness can be cured with life experiences over medical training. I feel like you arent giving mental illness the respect it deserves believing like so many do that its just something you can get over if you think hard enough.  I repeat for the sake of the health and lives of the people you care about if you believe them to be mentally ill take them to a doctor. Please. Honestly I beg you. Because your attitude while well intentioned is very dangerous. You seem like a nice person. So I dont believe youre doing this for any reason other than caring. But please do not ever think you know more than a doctor. Doctors arent perfect and infallible. But they know more than you. Thats not personal. Its just true.  On behalf of the mentally disabled community I beg you to stop this crusade or whatever it is and always take people to the doctor and dont offer any advice based on anecdotal evidence. Lives are at stake here. Even if you dont appreciate how serious mental illness is it doesnt make it less so. You will probably say you do take it seriously. But by your actions you clearly dont take it seriously enough. No offense.  We can argue the other points forever. I dont really mind. What is vital to understand though is that if you try and give advice to anybody with a mental illness that isnt from a doctor you are putting their life at greater risk. If you think Im overreacting that just proves my point. Please if you care about someone just tell them to go to a doctor and dont try and give them your own advice or push a lifestyle onto them. Its dangerous. It has very real consequences. You may think you are helping but you are not. You are potentially making it worse. All the people who advise their loved ones to megadose vitamin c to cure cancer believe completely that itll work that they have the scientific knowledge to argue their point that itll genuinely work. They cant see that what theyre doing is incredibly dangerous. Please take a step back and listen to what youre saying.

Lots of yoga paths incorporate lyingdown poses.Although lying down at the end of a long day will probably end with snoring and drooling regardless of the setting or material under you.Some say that theres a whole spiritual reason that you must have your spine erect for meditation  but Ive seen very evolved senior citizens lie down for practice and they seem to be spiritually just fine!,Meditation,cj8hme5,1,t5_2qnc9

Basically she was worried because TM fell outside the circle of her very limited religious belief. Over time she saw mediation had positive effects in my life and she stopped worrying. or at least she stopped talking to me about meditation.,Meditation,cj94ji8,1,t5_2qnc9

1558152,0,t1_cjbglkm,My interpretation is hes saying if you believe to be a separate entity separate bodymindhuman then there will be thoughts that appear with the root of them reinforcing you exist separate from every thingone... For example  I am hot I am confused I am tired I dont want to feel thisAll of these example thoughts are based on you being a separate entity a separate personhuman as indicated by the I. I am something thus I am separate over here feeling this or that. Now if you really question and ponder am I really this seemingly separate bodymindhuman that appears to have borders and theres another human with borders and another animal and another object..... If you really question all that and are open to the possibility that you could be something more than just a humanmind.... What if I am that which is aware of this human bodymind? What if that which is aware of this human bodymind is NOT separate but instead that is what is shared amongst everyone? If you are truly open to these types of possibilities then those I thoughts or similar ones reinforcing separateness will not go under the radar so to speak to keep justifying you have a separate existence. Then... since you have an open mind about your existence you can investigate ponder question the separateness that you were taught you are. Now you can do experiments and such.... Now when I thoughts appear personal thoughts as he calls them you just know you dont have to believe them... You arent convinced you are a separate entity anymore... Then those personal thoughts of separation will fade away due to your lack of interest in them... Then the effect of body reactions due to thoughts of separation will disappear as well... For example lets say you are really worked up in some way and think I dont want this!!! and it is accompanied by some heavy tense body sensations those sensations will either not be there or be very temporary once you stop believing the thoughts of separation that triggered them.,Meditation,cjbl685,3,t5_2qnc9

1572192,0,t3_2c9f5c,For me chakras and your internal energy be it your Ki or your kundalin or whatever is a very sketchy subject. There are some empirical evidence in their favor like there being similarities in the chakras theories in different cultures throughout time but not a definite proof. It can be easily dismissed as a placeboeffect type of thing since people seem to be aware of their chakra after they actively try to feel them having to know beforehand where they are.I dont think they are important for meditation although some traditions say otherwise like yoga in it its impossible to achieve enlightenment or samadhi without clearing your chakras and having a kundalin experience. I suggest you do what you think is best to your own practice since its impossible to know for sure if they exist or not.,Meditation,cjdcjak,1,t5_2qnc9

If thats overwhelming you could try a kasina instead or if its too dry and dull you could try metta.  The object doesnt matter much at all. gt Do you have any recommendations for samatha techniques to achieve jhana? Stay light and playful.  Youll find it by experimenting not by accident or by following rules from a book. gt How long did it take you to reach it?I think it only took me a few months of study.  But I was quite young at the time which makes it easier. gt Finally do you recommend I do vipassana meditation after I reach some level in samatha meditation?It gets easier as you develop better jhana to apply to it but theres no reason not to start practicing vipassana now.  Theyre mutually supporting practices.  Getting insight into the nature of experience will also teach you how to steady your mind.  In the suttas samatha and vipassana usually appear in the same sentence and often as one compound word. gt Id like to reach the th stage of jhana and Ive heard keeping goals would slow me down but is this possible in samatha?Having plans and goals and adjusting your practice to direct yourself towards them is pretty much essential.

Remember loving kindness is active not passive  so be on the lookout for some way to help especially in very small ways.

1923083,0,t3_2gnmm5,Are you referring to the development of virtuous qualities?In Buddhist meditation there are  factors to a meditative state jhana and  hindrances to samadhi translated as collectedness of mind calmness or concentration. The  factors are directed thought sustained thought joy rapture and onepointedness of mind. Directed thought refers to directing the mind towards the object and sustained thought refers to keeping it there. Joy refers to the content mode of happiness which comes from being concentrated on the object and rapture refers to an extremely present feeling throughout the body. One pointedness refers to the minds undividedness in regards to the attention to the object.What were concerned about is the joy factor. The  hindrances of sensuality illwill drowsiness restlessness and doubt are a hindrance to all the  factors of a meditative state especially this joy. The one people really love is sensuality. Sensuality refers to seeking a delight within the sense objects whereas joy refers to simply being content with the sense object. Sensuality is a form of discontent because it means the mind is trying to find joy outside whereas the joy of meditation comes from contentment which is internal rather than external.The reason why this is important is because the meditative state is in fact a wholesome state whereas any state of mind taken over by the hindrances is unwholesome. So actually the only way you can meditate is by secluding yourself from unwholesome qualities.So if you want to meditate often and if you want to live in a calm and collected state then it would be recommended you put effort into fully abandoning unwholesome qualities which can be called selfimprovement. Note that you cannot live in jhana as far as I know because its a state of concentration but you can live in a state of mind which is calm and collected due to the subsiding or abandonment of unwholesome qualities namely the  hindrances and  unwholesome roots.So basically you should see meditation as part of this process of selfimprovement.Im not sure if you practice Buddhist meditation but I hope this helps.,Meditation,ckkx20k,4,t5_2qnc9

Besides whatever it is you think love means is different from what I think it means which is different from the next guy and so on.The problem is putting labels on things like this and thinking now we have some sort of understanding weve now got the Truth of the ineffable Universe snugly nestled into our gray matter somehow.

Its very hard to try again after deliberately backing off and returning over and over only to find that people do not want to hear. I hope youll forgive that I use this anonymous and fleeting format as a test space for sharing thoughts. I should offer my apology here to kirkirus as well who wasnt looking for an argument.Im making a mess of what I am trying to do. The tradition of meditation is an attempt to take the mind and its identity and rein it in whether to tame and control it or to work towards a state of nomind. This has been a very very necessary corrective path drawn through human history as it works to counter the excesses of unbridled ego and identity.What I would like to say is that as essential as it is it is only one half of the story. kirkirus was brave enough to make a strong statement that truth could not be put into writing which is what long years of careful practice can teach. I do not mean in any way to reduce him or his statement. If I could start over I would simply say What if it were possible? and he gave the best possible answer which is that I should share it with the world.My wife tells me I cant apologize for something a million times and not change. So jimmyslim youre right on all counts Im being fluffy vague and unconvincing and offering no proof. Let me simply say that I have opened some private conversations by replying to this topic and that each one is helping me to get to the point where I can correct each of those problems.

The initial stretch of breathing helps me get into my body and a little more focused. I also enjoy watching my breath before I smoke so that I can smoke mindfully. As far experiences with smoking and meditating Ive seen jesus on the wall saw myself plugged into a computer to say my mind is creating my reality matrix like Ive felt myself start to leave my body seen infinite matrices of reality felt palms light on fire with energy and general insights.I currently smoke daily although I would recommend savoring pot to have the most profound experiences to about once a week or once a month. I usually take at least a few months break from smoking though sometimes up to a year. Ive noticed daily smoking leads to forgetfulness carelessnesslack of motivation and being easily distracted. Although I have noticed that with improved awareness I can be much more mindful of the negative side effects of daily smoking which helps me gauge weeds potential harmfulness. Eventually though youre bodymindsoul needs a break to regain clarity.I have a feeling that there is a point in meditative practice when one no longer smokes after achieving a heightened level of selfawareness and selfcontrol. Weed once in a while can be a tool to boost awareness as well as a tool to escape. As always taking mindfulness into every possible second will guide you on your path. Good luck.,Meditation,ckv8pvn,2,t5_2qnc9
2024470,0,t3_2hxzmd,Make sure that your meditation increases your relaxation in the immediate moment. Dont tense now for the sake of relaxation later  thats good for certain situations in life but not when working with the mind directly. In other words the goal of meditation should inform the path. Meditation that leads to peace must be peaceful meditation.  Concentration is not tension its more like melting softly into something in a carefree way. Theres no need to make it into a task. As a college student you dont need more tasks you need more breaks. Let meditation be a break.,Meditation,ckx5iwz,3,t5_2qnc9

2037146,0,t1_ckyo5of,gt So there is nothing that needs to be added.There are drugs that take things away. Most psychedelics for example.gtthats what people do daily to their brains with various types of drugs.I doubt this is how an enlightened being would approach the situation.gtLetting the student choose their drugs for themselves is just letting the blind lead the blind.What about the stories of unenlightened teachers who show their students enlightenment?gtSo for this reason many people who find out about the possibility of enlightenment through LSD or DMT stop doing the drug and meditate their way to enlightenment instead.Taking the drug sounds like an important step to that process.gtthey just choose to go beyond their egos with meditation instead.There are drugs that take an individual beyond ego. The same ones you already mentioned.gtYou already have all the equipment you need between your ears. Like you already said drugs are a way to fine tune the instrument. gtHow do you know that the next drug that you take is the one you need right thenThrough investigation.gtIn addition the masters I have read say that drugs enslave the will to think that the drug is master over your consciousnessFor addictive chemicals this is true. Nobody who has a breakthrough experience on psychedelics gets addicted though the breakthrough experience is a glimpse of enlightened i.e. the end of attachments.gtSo that rather than training your will to be strong enough to take you beyond into enlightenment the will is weakened so that you think you somehow need drugs to do it for you.As far as I know people who has the breakthrough experience on drugs do not develop attachment. You might as well replace drugs with meditation in that sentence. It is not the activity it is the attachment.gtSo I am not saying that drugs are bad but they may be counterproductive for enlightenment after you start a search for enlightenment.Yes you are if you truly reflected on yourself you would see your own aversion. You are not presenting raw facts you are presented your bias interpretation of them.,Meditation,ckyrlnp,1,t5_2qnc9
2037565,0,t3_2i32hl,Hey. Meditation of course will help. But listen the others and go to visit a doctor.Our brain is made of chemicals. Sometimes the chemicals in our brain get unbalanced and you have depressions and so on. But seriously do not blame yourself. It is like if you contract the flu and you hate yourself for being weak tired and with high fever. It is not you it is the disease. The same is happening to you now. You have a disease that can be treated an it can be cured and you will be healthy again. The problem is that this disease is not like the flu and this one affects your mind so it can make you to make wrong decisions. Therefore listen to the others and seek for professional help. Do not trust your mind since it is affected by a disease. Trust us you can receive treatment and you will be happy healthy again!My mom was like you a year ago. He tried one doctor and it didnt work she didnt improve. However we convinced her to visit a second one and now she is happy again.Going to the doctor is not a bad thing at all. If you break one leg you go to visit a doctor. If you have a headache you go to visit a doctor. If you have pain in the stomach you go to visit a doctor. If you have an unbalance in the chemicals of the brain you go to visit a doctor. It is not asking for help it is just the normal thing to do!Trust me my friend you will be happy again.,Meditation,ckytipn,1,t5_2qnc9
2040178,0,t3_2i32hl,Erg. That sucks. The one thing that helped me the most was to think of the people that would be willing to support me even if I were a wreck. However if thats a problem you should seek out professional help.Back to your questions meditation can help you to stop feeling disgusted with yourself. It can also help you break out of any patterns or habits you feel stuck in. However it hasnt helped me to feel more value in things at least not yet. For that I think you should practice daydreaming about amazing and wonderful things. Keep this and the meditation practice separate  different times and different places if possible.I tried binaural beats through gnaural. They didnt do anything special. I thought it felt weird knowing that the beats didnt really exist except in my mind. Beside the usual meditation guides and info just start looking through the links in the sidebar Ill suggest that you dont read too deeply right now. At this point you may be thinking that you need to meditate in exactly the best most perfect way. The opposite is true. Meditation is like a vehicle. Even a car that doesnt run very well can get you where you want to go. If you spend time now trying to figure out every bump rattle and whine of your engine itll almost certainly take longer and it would probably have been easier to find a mechanic a meditation teacher or a motor club. With that in mind I suggest breathing meditation. Attempt to focus all your attention on the act of your breathing. When you realize youre not totally focused on your breathing return your focus to your breathing. As you continue this process try to relax more and more deeply. Your breaths should get deeper and slower and when youre done in five ten or more minutes you should feel good.If you try sitting crosslegged a sitting pad or bench can be helpful in getting your knees closer to the ground. A stack of folded pants makes a good substitute for a pad. Otherwise meditation while laying down is effective too. If you fall asleep good you probably needed it. Just try again later when youre less sleepy.,Meditation,ckz5h5g,1,t5_2qnc9

2055061,0,t3_2ic6ln,Despite all the pedantic bullshit youll hear in this subreddit yes it most definitely can. However the real question is is it healthy to suppress emotional reactions? Quite often the result of suppressing emotions is to make the situation worse in the long run. It is often more healthy to explore the roots of these emotional responses because really thats all they are  responses. When it gets really tough for me sometimes I try to think of emotions as weather on the mountain. Im the mountain in this metaphor.,Meditation,cl11kq5,3,t5_2qnc9

Where I disagree with him is in saying that consciousness does not remain after death. My experiences have led me to the conclusion that there is no death. Nothing truly dies and what we are never changes. The death of these body minds is like waking up from a dream.

Suddenly without any warning her parents discovered she was with child.This made her parents very angry. She would not confess who the man was but after much harassment at last named Hakuin.In great anger the parents went to the master. Is that so? was all he would say.After the child was born it was brought to Hakuin. By this time he had lost his reputation which did not trouble him but he took very good care of the child. He obtained milk from his neighbors and everything else the little one needed.A year later the girlmother could stand it no longer. She told her parents the truth  that the real father of the child was a young man who worked in the fishmarket.The mother and father of the girl at once went to Hakuin to ask his forgiveness to apologize at length and to get the child back again.Hakuin was willing.

Meditation is about cultivating awareness of your mindmade activity but the irony is that the better you get at observing the busier your mind seems to be...simply because you are more aware of its compulsive nature. People dont realize this and they think they are failing or they arent as good after months of meditating as they were in the beginning. The reality is though that they are more aware. At this point you focus on recognizing the temporary nature of your mental constructs and how not to get swept away by the mind. Thats not to say that you shouldnt do this from the beginning...but things tend to happen in stages.If you want my advice it would be to focus on a consistent daily practice first. Once you develop the habit of meditating every day and have that routine established...at that point then you should look at longer forays into each meditation session.Best of luck!,Meditation,clsxxd6,6,t5_2qnc9

I have been living with depression and anxiety for many years I self medicated and fell into a long long descent of selfdestructive heroin addiction and have only just begun to feel human again after close to six months clean. Even on bad days I just try to observe the feelings as they are instead of fighting them or pretending they dont exist. Feelings and thoughts are not wrong They just are. You just have to learn to live with them as they are rather than identifying with them and allowing them to consume you. At least that is what has worked for me. ALWAYS be honest with yourself. Even on days where I just feel like garbage I believe I am still at peace because I know it will pass. That those feelings are not me if that makes any sense. I now have more good days than bad and for once I think I know how to deal with my emotions and intrusive thoughts in a way that does not destroy me something I have never been good at. It isnt perfect and it never will be but I feel at peace. That is the key I think not to strive for happiness. No one is happy all the time. But to reach for peace of mind.PM me if you want to talk.

As you say theres no need to rely on a tradition in order to gain benefits but they could provide you a really useful map.Im interested in eastern philosophy and my readings really helped me to understand some insights and to overcome hindrances. This very community is really helpful and months ago I made a huge leap foreword thanks to the support of a Redditor. You learn faster if you can rely on a teacher or at least on teachings.I particularly like Zen Buddhism because its more atheistic than atheism itself and its approach is perfect to neutralise my control tendencies. Said that theres value in every ancient wisdom because its based on millenarian experience. Words could be offputting but thats your problem words are just words reality is experience  or at least it is within the context of meditation.On a side note I think in the West theres a huge bias toward religions caused by the Catholic Church. In East didnt even exist the term religion before Westerners introduced it. At best you could talk about cosmology and I can assure you they understood human nature psychology way before us.

There is openness and depth beyond vision but it can be hard to notice because the sense of sight is so shiny. Just like moths go towards light people go towards light too with their attention.Experience is like boundless space but we go towards the light and light is always limited.In exactly the same way that you can look at something but then look at something else in your peripheral vision without moving your eyes you can look at your visual sense while looking at whats beyond it.,Meditation,cmhlstj,2,t5_2qnc9

2512618,0,t3_2oecit,I was in a very similar situation as the one you describe.This topic is very close to me so forgive me if I might start rambling in this post.Here are some of my thoughts and solutions to your questionsproblemsYes it is extremely helpful and I have improved my situation to a degree I would not have thought possible.The best part about it is you can easily do it yourself.If you like you can simply give my routine a shot and see how well it works for you. If you actually stick with it you might be surprised how well it actually works.Here is what I didI have so radically improved my situation in the last couple of months I would not have believed this to be possible at all.I have been consistently meditating for about  months at least  minutes a day. mostly vipassana some metta recently experimenting with some free TM techniques. Mostly before I go to bed at night. I almost never have any problems falling asleep anymore.However meditation was not the only thing I changed about my life.I realised life is all about balance. Anything done to excess will eventually come full circle and be detrimental to your situation.So instead of just meditation I started doing yoga regularly. Every day in fact. I try to get at least  minutes in which to be honest is not a problem. It is a concious choice you make and you stick with it.Regular exercise. I lift weights at least  times a week. I make sure to make it intense and give it my all. If I cant do as many reps as last week I do not worry about it. What matters is you actually do what you set out to do which is work out.Concious choices are what life is all about my friend. If you let your unconcious mind take over most of the time it will just do what it did most of the time until now and you know where you are at right now.This extends to your education aswell but that is a bigger topic and if you dont mind I will not go into detail on it. But essentially everything in life follows the same pattern.Concious decisions and consistent practice is the key to get what you want out of life.This sounds easy in theory but you might still have a couple of setbacks. Dont worry about this. You made the choice once nothing is stopping you from making it again.I did it. So I know you can do it too.If you want me to I can go into more detail tomorrow. Feel free to PM me with more questions or just reply to this post maybe others will benefit aswell.Take care,Meditation,cmmjd86,6,t5_2qnc9

2630460,0,t3_2q0w77,Im sorry youre dealing with this. Its an incredibly hard situation and very difficult to concentrate on anything when youre in pain. Physical emotional mental  it doesnt matter.For me meditation has a helpful tool in dealing with depression and anxiety. But it is only a tool along with medication and regular therapy. If you have access to professional help and havent sought it out yet Id really encourage you to do so. Depression is just like any other illness  when the situation is severe its almost impossible to pull yourself out without outside intervention. Unlike other illnesses those of us who experience depression often feel or are told that outside intervention is a sign of weakness. Im sorry if you feel that or have heard it. Please know that its not true.With that said meditation has many benefits for someone who experiences depression and anxiety  even when youre in an intensely unsettled state. The most helpful thing to remember is that meditation is a practice. Its not always going to be perfect and youre not always going to achieve a calm quiet mind. Sometimes the act of sitting still and trying to attain peace for a few minutes is as good as its going to get. That doesnt represent failure. Its what it means to practice. I find myself focusing on the physical sensations that accompany depression and negative emotions and find that helpful. For instance depression often sits like a band across my chest right inside my ribcage. Ive imagined breaking that band apart and letting the pieces fall away just to see what it feels like to exist without that physical tension for a few minutes. When someone is bothering me I try to see how long I can go without letting them enter my mind. When I feel them knocking around the edges of my brain I redirect my focus back to what its like to exist without them. Eliminating annoying sensations and people doesnt create perfection inside myself. But it allows me to see aspects of my inner life that were masked by discomfort and annoyance. You may find as I do that youre the best person to give yourself advice  as long as you listen to your constructive inner voice. It exists separately from the inner voice of depression and uncertainty and separately from the noise created by annoying problems and people. Its the voice that analyzes your responsibilities over the next few hours or days and tells you what you need to get through them.For instance when meditating about an upcoming event at work I found myself repeating the mantra not my circus not my monkeys. It was a reminder to do my part and not worry about the aspects of the event that werent assigned to me. When my family was moving the words that came to mind were peace in instability and I meditated on the phrase in hope of remaining calm and stable while our physical surroundings changed. When you look inside yourself youll understand what you need  your areas of deficit  and can focus on ways of building them back up. You can even imagine actually building them  one image I often meditate on is a candle being dipped in wax over and over until it has enough layers to burn. Ive gone on quite a bit and am not sure that Ive said anything youll find personally helpful. I hope so though! So Ill add that at my lowest points Ill meditate multiple times a day  thinking of it as a luxurious escape of  or  minutes. Ill focus on one word like peace without connecting it to anything in my life or making any judgements on what it means in the wider world. Ill just picture the word itself giving it a shape a texture curves and shadows. Ill picture it as a statue Im climbing. And when my mind starts to wander Ill go back to the physical form of the word just contemplating it. The benefit of this Ive found is that it becomes easier to pull yourself into a meditative relaxed state and this becomes an escape from the depression youre experiencing outside of your meditation area. Knowing that you can escape  if only in dribs and drabs here and there  becomes a powerful tool and a very meaningful one. You learn how to change your state and can do so more easily than you could before.With that said its practice. So dont be too hard on yourself. Just try to escape for as long as you can  even if its only a few minutes at a time and let yourself build to longer periods. And do seek help from professionals who in my experience have given some of the most helpful advice and perspective on handling depression daytoday and reshaping thought patterns in a way that promotes construtive meditation.Good luck. I hope things get better for you. hugs,Meditation,cn1xorn,2,t5_2qnc9

2693005,0,t3_2qvniv,How long have you been sober and how long have you been smoking weed while taking antidepressants? You could be having post acute withdrawal. Pretty intense depression and anxiety can occur when just getting sober and PAWS can last  months if not longer. Furthermore your brain doesnt even fully recover from long term abuse for almost a year or more. Your chemicals are all screwy. Your brain and system expect the alcohol and THC to provide dopamine so it takes time for it to start on its own. Also THC prevents SSRIs from doing what theyre supposed to do to stop depression. Its awesome youre meditating to get rid and lower your suicidal ideation. Just keep in mind that the substance use makes depression worse over a longer period of time and it can make it harder to recover. Dont give up yet.

Meditaiton to me is no longer about self improvement though that can be a useful byproduct. The point is more about coming to experience things exactly as they are even if its resisting some quality of that moment. The shift in perception comes not from improving ones self though that has a place which is why I do therapylovingkindness the shift comes from simply attending to what is happening for the very sake of attending to it.

The western view of suffering may assume that suffering needs to be epic and that to admit that we all suffer to some degree sounds like some sort of First world problems person saying that my jacuzzi being too hot is now an epic problem like the soldier being wounded. No its about the intrinsic problems about craving for things that tend not to satisfy that very craving and how that creates cycles in us that we cant stop  no matter the jacuzzi the soldier thewhatever that is in our lives. The closest western phrase that resembles Buddhist suffering is the psychological notion of the hedonic treadmill.gtrank your suffering above that of others with this kind of thought.no the point is you are experiencing some sort of burning an inner tearing something  and to wish that on others feels worse. when were frustrated we can start saying things like fuck everything fuck everyone fuck this and so instead of going into that directly the point is just to redirect the train i do not wish others to be caught in a cycle of rambling words like fuck everything fuck everyone fuck this. You see? Its nothing at all to do with ranking or degree  its just about rerouting an energetic pattern that will not stop repeating against the grain of the point of metta.gtWhen its difficult to feel compassion it might be more productive to concentrate on the feeling of how difficult it really is. These words seem to focus on and reinforce feelings of suffering.OK but this is not meant for times when feeling compassion is difficult. Its for times when lovingkindness is failing due to aversion which is burning up the self. The point is you are focusing on how difficult it is and using that in your favor. Its rerouting not wallowing or selfwhining. NonBuddhists seem to think that suffering means something very negative or worldending but it just means being off or not in harmony with the ultimate truth of phenomenagtI could be totally wrong and your words might have a different feel and come from a different state of mind than I would perceive them to if I were saying them. Yeah thats the problem with the written word but as long as we dont take reddit too seriously we can say things we dont mean at one turn correct course and arrive at a good place  sort of like the charts that graph a stock that is rising over time. Two steps forward then a miscommunication then a correction and then three forward and a major fight and an apology. Its slower than the spoken word but if you give people space to say things they dont mean and take their words literally dont assume they have agendas that arent typed then it can get somewhat helpful.Cheers!,Meditation,cnr3imk,6,t5_2qnc9

Have him play the C note maybe chord more resoundingmore waves. See where you feel it. Where it resonates with you.

In other words this videos other section was about taking full responsibility for all of our thoughts as another solution for example. But Sam Harriss view is to go in the opposite direction and relax this whole king of the mind and fullresponsibilitycontrol angle to simply focus on causes and effects of suffering in general putting ones eyes on wherever effects arise without adding to ego or blame to the owner of those causes. Do we blame or highfive a weather pattern? No and yet we are neural weatherpatterns in some verysignificant sense.

3138761,0,t3_2w2o16,Im writing this after reading your text and have decided to not read the comments since they will influence my thought pattern while I write this.I can understand the paradigm shift that you underwent last summer. Two years ago before christmas I ate shrooms for the first time in my life. I was  back then so I did this prepared and well educated on what psilocybin will do with the body and the mind.When we came back from the trip which was a profound and deeply spiritual experience for me my whole world changed. I could see patterns in everything and could easily observe how ridiculously simple everything in life is if you go past that cloak of complexity. I too was thrown in a honeymoon at first. My behaviour got really weird and made me lose some friends that I probably wouldnt have gotten close to anyway in the long run.I can understand many parts of what you are saying in your post. But even if you are awakened thats still not a reason that your mind andor ego wont try to wrestle control from your existence. You see as soon as you start to think about being in control and acting spontaneously you wont notice that the mind has found a backdoor and is back without you realising. Because why else are you on one hand saying that you feel the oneness with everyting in your surrounding and on the other hand putting in an edit saying that youre dissappointed over the immature responses and how you have a deeper understanding of meditation than most in here?You need to assess this reaction and see if the same mechanic isnt present in your eating habits or your strife to not be normal or your idea of not wanting to do anything. These are all the same manifestation of the ego thats giving power to these thoughts and realising them for you. One can never be enlightened if he complains about how everyone else is acting badly because of them not being as enlightened as yourself.You still have long ways to go as do we all. Life will always challenge you and you will lose this position of being the absolute the witness being in the presence or whatever this state of being can be called. But the important part is to realise when you have been thrown back into the nonpresent state and work on finding that state again. Actually work isnt a good word to use since the present state is a completely effortless state. You seem to have lost this state a way back and have somehow tried to rationalise this by creating a new identity for yourself as this allloving nonwanting avocadoeating awakened person. You have grown so fond of this search for spirituality that instead of finding your presence you are constantly striving for finding spirituality yet it is always here. You dont need to search for it.,Meditation,conbv7e,12,t5_2qnc9

3160591,0,t3_2wcd5d,I did Vipassana last year and I agree that Goenka tends to talk a lot of bullshit and its hard to filter it out as you have no other contact no opportunity to debate and you are mentally exhausted.  But I dont think he actually has any evil intentions its just that his interpretation of the process is pushed onto you. If you go into it with that awareness then I think you are okay.  I was lucky because on I think the second day Goenka made a claim about how some particular predictions by Buddha were verified by modern Science and I have a Physics degree so was able to do a calculation in my head that showed me that Goenka was wrong.  After that I took everything he said with a massive pinch of salt.  Also he talked about how he used to be a salesman before getting into Vipassana and so I always just considered him a dodgy Vipassana salesmen.  But just because there is a dodgy guy selling you a car it doesnt mean the car is bad. Other people might have been drawn in by what he said entirely which I think would be a shame.  As Buddha said it is always better to experience things for yourself directly than to listen to other peoples interpretations.  Goenka heavily interprets the process from a Buddhist perspective and yet claim to be nonreligious  it is a Buddhist organisation.  He also makes some pretty outlandish claims about an ancient prophecy that the Goenka movement is fulfilling  very humble. They also put an emphasis on speed and especially towards the end of the  days they try and motivate people to meditate more because You only have  days left  that is potentially very damaging and I really dont understand why they dont encourage more patience.  You have the rest of your life or if you accept Buddhist thought the rest of infinity to reach enlightenment and so there really is no hurry.  All that said the process itself is very profound and taught me a lot about what I am. Like I said I dont think they are evil and there are legitimate reasons for the limitations they put on you.  It is simply that for an organisation to spread they need to have these qualities of selfreplication and indoctrination.  If Vipassana courses were purer they wouldnt grow into as big a movement so you wouldnt have heard of them. ,Meditation,copldh6,8,t5_2qnc9

3223106,0,t1_cow1fnf,I also believe this based on what I have experienced however this does not mean that the brain is irrelevant. It seems to act as a kind of transceiver like a tunable radio and what it is channelling at any given instant is certainly partially determined by neurodynamics. Thus we can leverage the modulation of these neurodynamics to get us much closer to spirit. However this does not conclusively prove that spiritual states are determined by the brain only that they are correlated. I am very open to the possibility that there are states that can be attained which are not relevant to neurodynamics however these are very very very advanced states and only a tiny tiny number of people who meditate ever get there. With this tech you can still get to some incredible places such as complete ego dissolution melting in bliss and so on.

Very simply once youve settled simply begin to notice all of the sensations thoughts feelings and perceptions that arise. This is a completely effortless and nonjudgmental thing. Youre not counting or tallying. Youre not trying to push anything away or keep anything. Notice how things just kind of happen on their own and you can just rest and be aware of them.As part of your daily session this will help form that habit of being aware of the subtle movements within yourself without grasping any of them and over time that will help you to allow feelings of anxiety and distracting thoughts arise and fall away without your involvement.

If the breath is stuck just follow stuck breath. You dont need to manipulate or control your breath in any way. Now is not the time for control now is the time to let go and allow breath to function naturally.Youre breathing effortlessly right now well probably right up until I reminded you of breath. So just breathe that breathing in meditation. ,Meditation,coyygi7,3,t5_2qnc9

3267608,0,t3_2xjnmq,As ucybaritic said meditation is not the absence of thought. Meditation is an awareness of thought. A clearer mind often naturally occurs as a result of said awareness. When you meditate on something you usually bring up a specific thought question or memory once youre settled on the breath. You then with awareness watch the feelings and thoughts that arise in response to that stimulus. Sometimes you may specifically hone in on a feeling. Not in a way that youre holding on to it but instead really noticing how it feels and changes within the body. For example if you wanted to meditate on the feeling of anger you might replay a memory in your mind that encompasses said emotion. You then turn your awareness to the feeling that arises in response to this memory. It might be strong subtle big small comfortable uncomfortable. How ever it feels you sit with it and let it be. Through this type of practice you can gain insight on how you respond to certain things or how a particular emotion really feels to you. It is perhaps more focused on learning about a specific experience or area of your life than general mindfulness meditation. ,Meditation,cp0qfht,15,t5_2qnc9

I would like to hear more maybe even a post if youre feeling expressive about teachers different advice about thoughts. I hadnt even considered this on the level of taxonomy the way you have and Id bet others havent either. That is because as meditators we are usually just taught to ignore undermine or just continuouslyobserve thought.Ive read a bunch of suttas and sutras on this and of course you and others here have probably but I think a laypersons perspective on what they read outside the scriptureworld would be much appreciated.

3475024,0,t3_301tmt,First you misunderstand evolution. Evolution is the tendency for organisms to become adapted to their environment over many generations due to natural selection. Evolution does not guarantee improvement only adaptation. Organisms may become more or less complex more or less specialised  its not a ladder to the top. Second its a fallacy to argue from nature many things are natural without being good  infanticide for example.But on to the main point  improvement is relative and can only be based upon arbitrary perspectives. Life is about tradeoffs improvements always come at some expense even if its only opportunity cost. And if your perspective happens to change things which once seemed like blessings might seem like sacrifices and vice versa.One example of this might be the path of training your body from obesity to fitness. Initially you must bear the discomfort of change  denying yourself food abstaining from lazy habits enduring difficult physical exercise to lose weightgain muscle. Has your life improved? From the perspective of your obese self it hasnt you are much less comfortable than you were before. From the future perspective of your fit self however none of these things are disadvantages  they become blessings.So it is with accepting things as they are. From the perspective of a person who lives primarily in the past or future finding the motivation to improve is as important as highcalorie snacks are to an obese person. Eliminating it seems like a sacrifice  how are they going to improve themselves or get what they want if they eliminate their desire for it? From the perspective of someone who totally accepts the present moment the problem is solved from the other direction  they get what they want because they no longer desire anything more than that which they currently have. Lacking the drive to improve is no longer a disadvantage  it is a blessing.,Meditation,cpodmk5,3,t5_2qnc9
3475293,0,t3_301tmt,acceptance has only to do with the present. after accepting that what is currently happening is currently happening you change the things you do not prefer. Before you say well that is already the case.... no it is not. Say you get a flat on the way to a job interview. You can deny it has happened be angry about it bargaining depression  and finally acceptance after which you change the tire and move on. So acceptance is really a necessary step before solving a problem. The intent is to skip all of those other emotions so you can move to doing whatever is necessary.,Meditation,cpoeqhd,1,t5_2qnc9

Ill just respond to a couple of things youve said for the sake of clarity.gtI believe that you are saying that I couldve said it in a different manner though.Not only. What I am saying is that you shouldnt be inventing your own meditation method and trying to teach it. You shouldnt be confusing people about what meditation is. If you want to talk about results youve had in your own experimentation thats possible and may even be helpful to others but to present it as a course and to set yourself up as the expert is in my opinion misleading both the people who may visit your site and yourself.gtI have accomplished the fruits of my meditative practices.gtThough I have little experience with teaching I have executed built and benefited from this practice for nearly a year. I know it intricately.Just the fact that you actually believe less than a year of selfguided practice makes you an authority speaks volumes about selfdelusory capacity.

3541069,0,t3_30spz6,In the sense that directing your mind toward an object is thinking then yes.In the sense that thinking is referring to conceptual thoughts e.g. the inner monologue or inner visualizations then no.There are different levels of perception. This guy explains them wellgtThere are multiple kinds of mental phenomena not all of which can be classified as thoughts.gt. First and the crudest kind are visualizations cravings and replays. This is when we mentally leave here and now and are experiencing what basically is a short or long daydream about the subject our mind is concerned or agitated about.gt. The second kind are mental chatter. This is when we think in words silently saying them in our head. If you look carefully you will notice how the muscles of the tongue and lips are slightly engaged as you pronounce your inner speeches.gt. The third kind is conceptual thinking. This is when we mentally follow a chain of logical relationships between objects or concepts. These are still thoughts.gt. The fourth kind is labeling. This is when we mentally recognize phenomena we experience and identify them with a category or attribute that makes them distinct given the context.gt. The fifth kind is registering. This is when we make a mental note of experience without labeling it to any category. For the purposes of this answer these are the borderline between thoughts and nonconceptual experiences.gt. The sixth kind is nonconceptual perception. This is when we experience see hear smell or feel a bodily sensation or emotion without labeling acknowledging or noting it in any way. Famous technique used by Zen masters to awaken one to this level is to make a sudden noise in the middle of long meditation session.gt. The seventh kind is perception of energy. This is when we feel chakras and meridians.gt. The eighth kind is samadhi. This cant be described in words and must be experienced to be understood.gt When we say my thinking has stopped we usually mean levels  while levels  can still function. This said it is not like in meditation our goal is to stop thinking. Rather it is to open ourselves to levels . As we get better at this thinking can go on in the background without affecting our meditation.How can I know that I am clear of thoughts while I am meditating?Awareness is  bare awareness is beyond because even  is a subtle mental construct while conceptual thoughts are .

This very fact is incompatible with the path.On the part of the student exchanging money for services provides a perfect illusion of empty contentment and the illusion of progress via a process mirroring the usual moneybased existence.The tradition of giving and receiving alms and donations in order to maintain the logistics for teachings is a whole different thing. You receive the teaching you leave as much as you can afford when you leave if you feel youve benefited from it so that others after you may for free just as you did.I have not made this up. Its the way one of the major modern Vipassana schools of today operates.

4024970,0,t3_36itzj,Sorry if there are assholes. Im not an expert but I would point out that the stories or aphorisms meant to enlighten are generally trying to get the idea across of no mind. That is you arent thinking you arent planning ahead. You just ARE. Its very much a way of snapping the mental state of logical thought in order to achieve enlightenment or NOWness as it were. Many of the aphorisms seem to be assholeish because often the master does something cruel or is represented as cruel to the student. This emphasizes the point that there is often cruelty in providing enlightenment to a novice because the novice must undergo the small death of the selfego. I find many Zen aphorism books amusing because it seems the the story would always involve the teacher smacking humiliating or abusing the student and always end with And then the student was enlightened!I rather like this story    Gutei raised his finger whenever he was asked a question about Zen. A boy attendant began to imitate him in this way. When anyone asked the boy what his master had preached about the boy would raise his finger.    Gutei heard about the boys mischief. He seized him and cut off his finger. The boy cried and ran away. Gutei called and stopped him. When the boy turned his head to Gutei Gutei raised up his own finger. In that instant the boy was enlightened.My interpretation is that to mimic the forms is not the form. Words are meaningless they can only point the way but the finger that points at the moon is not the moon.Having said all this I just want to mention that I think enlightenment is a doing word very much like love or any of the higher emotions. I think that it is our actions in thought and in the wider world that define who we are as people. These are just words on the internet. Saying what I believe makes me sound a bit like an old master or someone who knows the hidden truth and rereading this sounds very preachy. Im really not conceited in real life honest! I hope this helps anyway.,Meditation,crf2rbt,1,t5_2qnc9
4028665,0,t3_36m5su,I know the answer to this question but Im not sure I can express it in words. I was sitting on my porch the other day about to meditate and I thought about just this. I was sitting on a chair that leans back so its hard to sit in it with a straight spine. I decided to sit then with my back curved and it felt fine since I only sat for like ten or twenty minutes. But in the moments right before putting myself into jhana my last thoughts were of just what youre asking about. I thought about the instruction to keep your spine straight. I thought of how its an absolutely serious intense reasoned instruction. I thought also of how it doesnt really matter since you can meditate in any position. Then I thought of it in more detail the why of why its a serious instruction and thats whats hard to say. Not just that sitting upright is better for your spine which it is. Thats just posture advice though. This isnt just unrelated advice about your posture it does mean something. Breath moves a force called prana through TENS OF THOUSANDS of complex channels arranged in your body. This is not a literal energy but rather patterns of unconscious attention. As your lungs move from breathing it moves your attention through not just your lungs but through your abdomen as your lungs move your abdomen through various patterns of motion around your abdomen in response to the motion in your lungs or it moves through your shoulders for instance in patterns in response to the air in your mouth and throat and the moving of your lungs your lungs are huge beating pushing everything in your body moves and your mind moves too with it deeply. Your mind moves constantly up and down your spine. It moevs differently of course in a spine thats straight in a straight spine the mind that moves up and down in the spine moves straight up and down. I thought of that for a moment. And I jokingly thought to myself that with my spine curved the prana would burst out of me at funny angles. But I was just kidding even though the instruction to stay straight is a very serious instruction and I sat there with my spine bent and went up the jhana ladder and back down and nothing went wrong because holding your spine straight is just one little thing just one of many instructions and unlike most acts meditation is very holistic very real. ,Meditation,crfhxqh,1,t5_2qnc9

4163912,0,t1_crujxv0,I agree but I feel like OP is pointing to a sexual addiction rather than an unusually strong but still in the healthyzone urge to masturbate frequently. Ive experienced this myself. I have an unusually strong sex drive. Im ok with it when it stays at a healthy level but there are periods in my life where Ill waste many evenings looking at pornography and will accomplish absolutely nothing productive. This is where it crosses the border to unhealthy. Youre sitting in a dark room looking at porn at  am despite the fact that you need to be up bright and early for work and you cant force yourself to stop.I personally believe this unhealthy level of sexual addiction is linked to other problems. Namely boredom and depression. Even though I have had a strong sex drive since puberty it doesnt always interfere negatively with my life. When I am happy and my life is filled with meaningful activities I do not feel the urge to masturbate any more than is necessary.However during those darker phases of my life where I find myself wasting countless hours sitting alone in my house and sulking I often find myself masturbating way more then I need to. In this more desperate and mentally deprived state the sexual urges will infest my mind and refuse to give me a break. Its almost like masturbation becomes a chore at this point something to push the unsatisfiable and unrealistic urges away for a little awhile.Ive noticed that these periods of my life come and go and reach varying extremes. When my mind resorts to filling itself with constant unwelcome sexual imagery I think it is simply responding to a lack meaningful activity in my daily life. It is the sexcraved minds response to being trapped in that lazy and depressed state for too long. You fall into this pattern of hypersexual thinking because you have nothing else of meaning to stimulate your mind. This thought pattern consumes you and quickly becomes habit. You are no longer a person with a strong sex drive. You are an unhappy addict. If this is a correct analysis and if meditation can indeed help a person alter harmful thought patterns then it may prove to be one of OPs most powerful tools at overcoming this horrible addiction. Meditation along with persistence and a careful examination of the daily routine and what can be done to invite more meaning and activity into it.,Meditation,cruw8mz,12,t5_2qnc9

It seems almost accidental or else Ive intuited it somehow. Since Ive started blinking out there have been some side effects. One was that I went to bed and slept for approximately two hours yet woke up completely rested. When I woke up I had a hypnagogic visual of beautiful geometric stars like an arabesque.

4237347,0,t3_39cfsa,Hi Ive been meditating six years and still have to deal with stuff like this on my worst days. First of all remember that this is a sloooooow process. Dont expect quick anything. You can shake loose suppressed muck that will leave you seemingly worse than when you started. But ultimately you can get past this stuff and then end up much better lighter more free than when you started because you dealt with something you normally push away. You can think of this tendency toward anger as an outgrowth of your personality type which according to the Buddhist text the Visuddhimagga would be called an aversive type. The good things about being aversive are that you can spend money on your setting to make yourself as comfortable and pleasant as possible. Not so for the greedy types! They have to be spartan. So for the anger Note the perception that triggered the anger that it was unpleasant the feeling tone and then the sensations in the bodyhead when the anger erupted. Thats really all there is to it. Eventually try to focus on how you relate to the unpleasantness. You will find that you want it to stop. You need to experience this yourself in order to find a good path toward the nonarising of the anger. The more you are thrown off disturbed etc. about the arising of the emotion the more you are attached to it. The more you are attached to it the more likely it is to become part of you and set deep in your subconscious. Eventually you will be able to see the perception arise see the unpleasantness arise see the reaction to the unpleasant arise and see it as just another arising phenomenon. It might never stop arising but your recovery with mindful awareness from this arising will become lightning fast. Rather than turning it in your mind and ruminating about this or that you will recognize know the reaction as it happens know that it is ceasing and move on!,Meditation,cs38z4v,1,t5_2qnc9

Antinomianism in modern times is commonly seen as the theological opposite to Legalism or Works righteousness the notion that obedience to religious law earns salvation.

4461740,0,t1_cst25ia,Okay heres the social interactions package. The big paradox in social stuff is that theres you and the way you see yourself and the way you actually act sometimes different from each other. And then theres the way another person sees you. Each person sees you differently filtered through their own history and beliefs and expectations and stereotypes. And not a single person on this planet will ever see the real you. The real you is not observable.With that in mind think about what it minds trying to please other people.It means you have to guess at what they expect... and it also means that its completely impossible to always please everyone at once because people have wildly opposing expectations and belief systems. It also means that when it comes down to it pleasing person X might not actually fit into your own value system. If theres a conflict between someone elses values and yours and theres no viable compromise your values win by default. This is the way you need to do it if you dont want the whole world to walk over you and there is simply no alternative. Within this set of parameters you can still decide how much you favour your own wishes over someone elses but there are clear boundaries and you should always honour those.Once you realize that there will always be people who judge you poorly even if you are practically a saint its not a huge leap to also realize that there will always be people who support what you do who are on your side. Again neither of these are seeing the real you... but paying more attention to the people who support you is a whole lot more enjoyable and you can still consider the opposing sides view and ask yourself if there is any truth to it. If someone says you suck at resolving conflicts theres a chance theyre right and if that matters to you you can look into ways to handle conflicts differently. Getting emotionally caught up in whatever they said is basically optional theyre biased anyway. Take the sliver of insight and ignore the rest.Big decisions yeah those are tricky. I can maybe say some more about this if you give an example. In general if youve got a big decision to make and after looking into it all options have a comparable amount of advantages and disadvantages then any choice you make is workable. You can roll a die if you like. If you suddenly start feeling really bad about one of the choices while the die is in the air there might be a good reason to not pick that choice. For some decisions its actually more feasible to do a trial run than you think. Should you go to university? See if theres a free online programme you can look at. Should you get into the workforce? Maybe theres an internship somewhere that you could check out. Should you travel the world to find yourself? Definitely not. Youre already right where you are. No need to chase yourself. Will constant practice help? Yes. The important thing is to do it consistently... either at a specific time or in a specific situation that happens fairly regularly. A commute is a great example of the second one. I recommend not planning longer sessions than you can handle by the way. Sitting down for fifteen minutes and spending ten of those fruitlessly fighting a sense of unrest is much worse than sitting down for five minutes. When youre done with a session draw a mental line clearly mark out the end. This too adds an element of consistency and trains you to end the session when you mean to end it not when you get distracted.More questions? Feel free to ask. I might not always be around though. ,Meditation,cst2ydt,1,t5_2qnc9

Your mind is ALWAYS like that with thoughts. Its always talking to you commenting on what is happening kind of like babbling idiot! Some people call this monkey mind. Meditation is a thing you can do that calms you down and lets your mind calm down. First you just sit and focus on your breath breathe in breathe out.  You do this for a few minutes. Guess what your mind does? It wanders.  But you can notice you arent thinking about the breath anymore and go back to thinking about the breath.  This is sorta catching your mind thinking and trying to calm it down a bit like catching your dog running around and petting her to calm her down.  This is concentration meditation some people people call it a fancy name of samatha. This meditation strengthens your mind and lets you focus. Thats good for the next step in observing thoughts. Youve already caught your mind wandering a lot. Lets watch what it is doing!Once you get pretty good at this by meditating every day it takes a little while you can try ANOTHER way of meditating   just start being aware of those thoughts coming and going like cars passing by on the street. Hearing sounds smelling smells your leg hurting noticing the taste remaining of the cheeseburger you just ate  those are all just thoughts! What you think of as YOU is just all these thoughtcars zooming by. The more you watch the more you see these thoughts arent helpful and they repeat a lot and mostly cause you stress and suffering! But you keep watching. The better you get at it the more thoughtcars you can watch arise and pass away!  This type of meditation is called insight meditation fancy word vipassana and concentration meditation made your mind STRONG so it can FOCUS on all these thoughts whizzing by!  After a LOOONG time it really sinks in that things are impermanent thing of all the things and people that have passed through your life  gosh! unsatisfactory weird how I have last years iPhone but that new iPhone makes me SO EXCITED! and my iPhone looks poopy now and selflessnotyou you dont identify with those crazy monkey stream of thoughts.  This changes your perspective on life and reality which some people think is really cool!So get your mind STRONG and calm down those monkeythoughts jumping around first. Then when you mind is strong you can just try to be aware separate from all those thoughts jumping around driving by a bare awareness of all the thoughts this brain is thinking. Once you do THAT you will feel like all of us are ONE and that is really something!,Meditation,ct18efd,1,t5_2qnc9

Before during and afterwards it can cause many negative thoughts and emotions that trouble me as I allow this to happen.I have watched the result of my inaction many times and it has sometimes caused me great suffering and yet still I do it.Perhaps Im rambling a bit here but it comes down to ones expectations and ones perspective. I may be very happy to do nothing at all and procrastinate indefinitely. Some people do this and lead relatively happy lives. I may be very happy to do everything that springs to mind and jump at each opportunity. Some people do this and lead relatively happy lives.Its up to each individual to decide what is important to them in the present and what will be important in the future so that they may prepare for it.

4544798,0,t1_ct3hl2t,gt Have you ever tried Mahasistyle noting? Its a really powerful technique for developing deep insights quickly.I never gave it a fullfledged sampling for personalpreference reasons. I talked to a few people who knew Mahasi and the higher level disciples and they noticed that Mahasi and them were all very unmoving and empty looking like mindful sloths and I dont want that personally. I have nothing against it just not for me. I prefer techniques where the higher levels totally support demonstrating energetic actions and a radiant attitude for that I consulted Dzogchen texts Zen can be quite intensely subdued too.Im very confident that Mahasi noting is effective and people have always said that it brings about results. What do you think of the following exchange between Jack Kornfield and Ajahn Chah upon coming back from working with MahasigtWhen I returned to practice in Ajahn Chahs community following more than a year of silent Mahasi retreat I recounted all of these experiencesdissolving my body into light profound insights into emptiness hours of vast stillness and freedom. Ajahn Chah understood and appreciated them from his own deep wisdom. Then he smiled and said Well something else to let go of. His approach to enlightenment was not based on having any particular meditation experience no matter how profound. As Ajahn Chah described them meditative states are not important in themselves. Meditation is a way to quiet the mind so you can practice all day long wherever you are see when there is grasping or aversion clinging or suffering and then let it go.My take is Kornfield misinterpreted Ajahn Chah. Ajahn wasnt dissing Mahasi he was dissing Kornfields enchantment that he was probably demonstrating while talking about the states he had attained. So Chah said to let go of the states not that Mahasi ignores lettinggo. Mahasi methods seem quite related to uprooting craving!,Meditation,ct3hy5s,1,t5_2qnc9

I saw that I had poured water down an anthill and I viscerally felt the pain of the ants. I saw an image of water inundating the hill and felt a sensation in my chest that may have been regret.

4740420,0,t1_ctr2w4u,That chemical imbalance exists because of your lifestyle though. You dont just randomly have a lack of happy chemicals in your brain serotonin dopamine etc.. People often say I just have a chemical imbalance so that they can deny all responsibility and therefore just take a pill that pharmaceutical companies say will fix the imbalance and then they dont have to change their lifestyle or address what might really be making them depressedanxious.Therapy and meditation etc. is always helpful. Medication is not. As someone whos battled with depression and anxiety a lot in the past couple years Ive spent a ton of time researching the condition and analyzing my own condition closely with trial and error using all kinds of methods. I tried medication shitty side effects and not much positive effect Ive gone to therapy I even went to Peru and did ayahuasca. NOTHING has spoken to me more than Dr. Stephen Ilardis Therapeutic Lifestyle Change method. I came across his TED talk  and it solidified some theories I had been thinking myself. And that is human beings were never designed for the poorly nourished sedentary indoor sleepdeprived socially isolated frenzied pace of twentyfirstcentury life.Basically the human bodybrain has not changed much since our Stone Age days yet our society and technology has changed immensely especially in the past  years. Our bodies were never designed for living in this society so our brain goes out of whack. Theres a reason why hunter gather societies that still exist today have almost zero instances of depressionanxiety.This chemical imbalance you speak of is a result of your lifestyle with contributing components such as your relationships career etc. Dr. Ilardi has  points that most people neglect and all of these things have been proven in studies conducted by him as well as other medical professionals to be more effective than prescription medication. Aerobic exercise for a minimum of  minutes week. Thats it. Its surprising how few people do this. His studies have shown that exercise alone has proven to be more effective than medication in many cases. Light Exposure  Exposure to the sun or a lightbox that emits the same amount of light  lux Omega Fatty Acid Supplements  These fatty acids have been shown to have antidepressant and antiinflammatory properties and studies indicate that they help serotonin and dopamine circuits in our brains function more efficiently. The supplement you take should have a minimum of  mg of EPA and  mg of DHA per day. AntiRumination  In the ancestral environment people had less time to sit alone and think negative thoughts. There were often activities to do or other people around to serve as distractions. This is no longer the case and many people in the modern environment may find they have plenty of opportunity to sit around and dwell on negative thoughts. Hobbies hanging out with friends exercising working meditating are all good practices for avoiding rumination. Social connections  Our ancestors lived in tightknit communities and were always interacting with family and friends. Living an isolated life like most people do these days is a big contributor to depression. Spending time with others is also a good way to distract yourself from rumination. Sleep Hygiene  One of the biggest risk factors for depression is sleep deprivation...And most people in our society never get enough sleep with work or school everyday something our ancestors never dealt with...they went to sleep when the sun went down and got up when it came up.If you are depressed go through this list of things and see if you are doing all of them. If you arent theres a good chance thats why youre depressed. Medication is a LAZY method our society resorts to because its easier for a doctor to simply say youve got major depressive disorder and write you a prescription instead of addressing whats really bothering you and considering that your lifestyle could be affecting your brain chemistry.Heres Dr. Ilardis book for anyone thats interested. His insights are so simple yet revolutionary in todays pharmaceuticaldominated world.Some bonus depression remedies Ive found useful areAs we discuss in this subreddit Meditation  The practice of meditation is useful in training your brain to deal with negative thoughts or feelings that arent beneficial to your mental wellbeing. In practicing to focus on an object of meditation a mantra or the breath you train your mind to focus on only what you want to focus on usually the present moment or not thinking for example and dismiss thoughts that are not beneficial to you. It has also been shown in recent studies that meditation is very good for the brain.Psychedelics  Many people with depression take medication and leave it at that. They never get to the bottom of what is really making them depressed. Theyre told that its a chemical imbalance they have an illness and theres nothing they can do about it but take a pill to correct this problem. Funny how no one in hunter gatherer societies have to take pills... This encourages drug dependence. And it encourages people to not really examine the foundations of the problem that makes them feel bad in the first place because you can simply mask the symptoms with a pill. Psychedelic medicines such as psylocibin mushrooms LSD ayahuasca allow you to explore who you are and understand it. Psychedelics open up the door to your inner psyche so you have human experiences and revelations about yourself and the world around you. The insights you can have on these medicines have been proven to be very effective in treating all kinds of mental illnesses yet they are not approved by the government because they cant make money from them and a lot of these treatments require counselling in conjunction with them which is so much more difficult than simply giving someone a pill and sending them on their way.,Meditation,cts2oua,1,t5_2qnc9

4747738,0,t3_3fxxg1,The notion that you can clear your mind or that meditation is a clearing of the mind is misleading. Meditation is a form of introverted observation. When you sit let the thoughts come. The more you try to fight thoughts the more conflict you will create in yourself. The practice is in simply existing in the moment without creating conflict. Thoughts are fleeting by nature it is when we dwell on these thoughts that our lives can be affected in a negative way. It is not an easy thing to do but try and just let the thoughts fly past you view the thought from a distance in an objective manner free from emotion. Our negative thoughts are often overblown in our mind and when we put them in perspective they become much more manageable.,Meditation,ctszx83,15,t5_2qnc9

4782962,0,t3_3gdfyt,This is a common dumbeddown easygoing approach that seeks to welcome the masses to meditation but propagates just as many myths. Meditation is not always easy. Sometimes you come up against your mind habit your preferences your old patterns. Sometimes the body feels stiff or achy. Sometimes emotions turn unpleasant. If you think that only easy meditation is correct meditation how will you embrace all of these different real parts of yourself with compassion and equanimity? Once you are inside meditation that nature of mind is indeed effortless but the path includes every part of us  what we like and what we dont like. Meditation takes time. It takes the time it takes in sitting and its results are accumulated gradually. While five to twenty minutes per day is already a very very wonderful practice that in itself is not enough to overturn the someodd hours or more of mind habit you engage in every day. If you aim low yes you dont have to put in much effort. But is that what the enlightened ones who passed down the practices were getting at is the lowest common denominator all that we should aspire to  a quick destress in the morning then back to the same habits that frustrate us the same selfcentered mundane rat race? Some of the things listed here as formalities are not just empty observances they are supports for the meditation and ultimately for the benefit of the meditator. There is a cause and effect to everything. In fact when the basic forms of duration posture and environment are right it contributes to the effortlessness of the practice. If posture is slumped or rigid the mind will be difficult to harmonize. If ones personal preference is the deciding factor in what goes on in meditation attachment will increase and one will never be free of ones like and dislike. If the meditators environment and lifestyle are chaotic and unhealthy calmness will be difficult or impossible to attain. The suggestion that the only teachers accessible are either to be bought here or found in India is irresponsible. Meeting a true teacher is lifechanging. It could be the most important relationship a person will ever have. And even just to understand the basics of a very basic meditation practice learning from a teacher can eliminate so very many problems and prevent you from wasting time running down blind alleys.,Meditation,ctxfkzu,2,t5_2qnc9

5016487,0,t1_cupy6za,The anxiety relieved by alcohol and nicotine is just the anxiety you felt about craving alcohol and nicotine. Longterm alcohol use inhibits the brains ability to regulate neural pathways. Thats whats meant by it being a depressant and why drug abuse is associated with losing interest in things. The signals in the brain are just way over damped.This is also why people suffering from severe alcohol withdrawl suffer from trembles shakes even lifethreatening seizures. The mechanism that used to damp out intense signals alcohol is now gone and the brain no longer has a way to handle this. Without the regulation you begin to lose control of your nervous system. Its called Delirium tremens In the short term alcohol is great at reducing anxiety. In the long term it destroys the brain which means that youre less able to cope with anxiety and stressful situations without alcohol. The fact that you go to alcohol when youre stressed out is a perfect example. Im not saying we should never drink alcohol I drink almost every other day.

Normally things would happen emotions arise we take action as necessary emotions pass. But we cannot do that due to the way the thought process clings to issues and regenerates emotions. We are all going to be thinking while we are alive and that is fine as longs as we keep in mind that our thoughts have no special relevance or significance.,Meditation,cv909ja,2,t5_2qnc9

Theres no particular form or feeling to truth no particular way its supposed to be. When your practice becomes allembracing without assuming that a particular event cant be it all of life becomes truth.For some meditators difficulty breathing can actually enhance the process bringing intense presence to mindfulness of breath. If you are working with breath as an object of meditation continue with your method. If you are counting count your inhalation and exhalation including coughs. If you are watching the quality of breath watch the quality including coughs.It has the added benefit of bringing the issue of impermanance home you can feel your vulnerability and experience very intimately the imminence of sickness aging and death. It is very fortunate to experience this deeply. It informs your direction and feeds your aspiration. No pun intended.,Meditation,cvacchf,1,t5_2qnc9

5233261,0,t3_3mocs9,Good to see a person striving for greater good..  Congratulations for that. The key to a good meditation is that you do it without any expectations of any results whether good or bad. If you are in that totally humble mindset and free of judgements than your meditation will blossom. But the paradox is this wanting too distracts you. The key is that simply be an observer. What ever you experience just watch without commenting. If commenting happens see that passively. Thus a passive watching is the technique great Zen masters use. They dont have any object of attention. They just sit and observe whatever happens physical or mental or spiritual... Without any personal judgements... Whatever goes on...its neither good nor bad. And than my friend you are instantly free. Free from the journey of eternal wanting.... Even spiritual.... For the first time you wont go somewhere... But you will arrive... And that too wont matter at a passive observing state. There is nothing to do or nowhere to reach and thus you arrive at the core where you will find eternal peace which you longed for so many lives and now that too will be observed by you...You... Where are you now? No where and everywhere... A trip is waiting for you where you will die... Not physically but by the means of ego. Happy journey my friend. There is nothing to lose except yourself. And only then you will be free. Free from all... Free at last. Thanks for reading... Lots of lovemetta.,Meditation,cvgsr0x,6,t5_2qnc9

5247159,0,t1_cvieow8,I have been very closely related with the meditative principles of Hinduism and Jainism.I have tried a lot of things in my life that would get me out my situation. I started working on myself long back and through that process I have become so calm that nothing fazes me anymore.So its not all of a sudden that I have started to question things. I have been questioning them for a long time and tried many different things to solve them. Early days of youth pass by with people telling that dont worry life gets better or it will get better or as the popular saying goes This tool shall pass. But that momenttime never comes. So I am trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together to not lose the moment that is with me now. I am not bothered about the past or the future.My question with this post is if you or any person for that matter ever feel that your life is just a result of others actions and inspite of having the capability or mental strength we can never achieve our potential in any sphere. I am not talking about a mundaneboring life here. Rather a life in which you feel chained and cant find the solution to. For example it often happens with us that we are sitting at the desk and the peneraser is right there on it somewhere but we cant find it. Time goes by and we are searching for it and such a petty thing complicates our life.And when that happens to each and every family member then it appears as surprising. I mean if I were the rotten apple alone then it could be easily explained but an entire group of people suffering from a problem that although very simple has turned their life upside down.Hopefully I have been able to explain my situation.,Meditation,cvigzhq,1,t5_2qnc9

The media dwells on the misdeeds of corporations and it may be that honesty goes unnoticed.  Its also true that among those with high incomes some are generous and some are not. I dont know the statistics.  The rich are famous for their sense of privacy.  They dont respond to polls.Im disturbed by the walmartization of business the elimination of small businesses.  The restaurant in the traditional sense of the word has become more or less a thing of the past. The hamburger franchise resulted in the restaurant franchise.  At one Pizza Hut Your hometown Pizza Hut as the old jingle went a manager was fired by the outof town folks because he didnt want his hometown employees to work on Thanksgiving.  Naturally stories like this result in editorials that vilify greedy executives but the fact is the executives the board and the CEO have to answer to the stockholders.  There are two very different novelists who come to mind  Ayn Rand and John Steinbeck.  In The Fountainhead the publisher thinks of himself as a leader until he realizes that all along he was merely a puppet of the mob.  In Grapes of Wrath Tom asks whos responsible for the farmers losing their farms and is told that no one is that its simply the breakdown of the economy.      Conservatives have often said that liberals have overcentralized government taken responsibility from state and local government.

5299193,0,t3_3nkydh,gtinternal dialog while doing Vipassana meditationIts understandable to think that noting is a verbal explicit sentence or phrase that we are sharing with ourselves. But many of these techniques that go under the category of noting do not actually use that kind of explicit labeling that youre doing explicit labeling I am sitting here there is my body here is reddit there is a tingle here is an itch theres my voice in my head saying this et cetera. Noting in and of itself is just to know that you look at the sight or just know that you hear the sound know that you think that thought that you in fact taste that taste and intuitively recognize that a quality of knowing that you are in fact looking at that sight tasting that taste et cetera...has a flavor. Saying words after you already knewsomething can be unnecessary.The recognition of that knowing quality is itself the note just a note that you are experiencing that experience. In other words verbal noting labeling can be skillful but it may be helpful to let it fade away as you advance in your technique.Here from Bhikkhu Khemavamsas Contemplation of MindgtLabeling in this practice is not used at all.gt...gtSay that you are experiencing anger. Anything to do with that anger you observe it whether it is the feelings your body sensations your mental activity and sensations. Any of it if you look at it is called noting your anger.gtBut if you are repeating anger anger anger to your self this is not called noting. Because now your mind is looking at the word anger and you are not thinking about what you are angry about any more.gtYou are not thinking about the story line any more.gtBut you are also not looking at anything that you are experiencing directly that is related to anger in your body and your mind.gtIf you are not observing any of this bodily and mental activity you are not noting you are just repeating a word to yourself.gtNoting means looking at the bodily and mental activity that is happening in the present moment.In other words if youre being mindful without discursive thinking if you just know youre looking then youre definitely noting and arguably noting better. ,Meditation,cvp17dm,4,t5_2qnc9

It seems like I have a choice to eat unhealthy but my motives over which I have no control dictate what I choose to do.Another way to say it is I believe that any choice you make is based off of a motive. That motive when traced back to its root comes from a place over which you have no control. Its a domino effect with only one possible outcome which is the outcome that I have chosen.,Meditation,cwxxqac,1,t5_2qnc9

5671501,0,t1_cwzwo5d,I dont think the imam should be removed. The imam is just saying what the many schools of islamic thought understand their law to be. Can you openly practice buddhism or hinduism in Saudi Arabia? You say the imam is a symptom and not a cause. The cause is islamic legal codes. This is why buddhism was eliminated in afghanistan. Islam is a sytem of laws its a political system.I agree that war is not the answer. I dont think though that we should have to like the islamic religion simply because it is called a religion. If people decided to call naziism a religion and worship hitler I dont think we should be obligated to like naziism simply because people started calling it a religion.

5711819,0,t3_3t5w5x, I do not know of anything more specific than mindfulness meditation. What you are describing is just a stage of development.If you have the required concentration purification of mind developed then it takes just noticing the thought as it arises to be able to let go of it and return to your object of meditation.If you do not have the required concentration you probably will not notice that thought as it arises though. Only after a few moments will you realize it has arisen. Then there is the tug of war.If you do notice the thought immediately after it arises but still do not have enough tranquility of mind a.k.a concentration which is less likely than noticing it some time after its initial arising then like you said there will be a tug of war between remaining focused on sensations arising in the present and wanting to follow that train of thought.Here is an excerpt from The progress of insight by Mahasi Sayadaw.gt The Purification of MindgtDuring the early part of the methodical practice as long as the meditators mind is not yet fully purified wandering thoughts arisen by his thinking of objects of sense desire etc. will also appear intermittently between thoughts of noticing the objects of meditation. Sometimes the beginning meditator will perceive occurrence of these interruptions and sometimes he will not. But even if he perceives them it will be only after a short time has elapsed after their appearance. For then the momentary concentration of his mind is still very tender and weak. So these wandering thoughts continue to hinder his mind while it is occupied in developing the practice of noticing. Hence these wandering thoughts are called hindering thoughts.gtWhen however the momentary concentration of his mind has become strong the thought process of noticing becomes well concentrated. Hence when attending to the objects to be noticed  the abdominal movement sitting touching bending stretching seeing hearing etc.  his noticing thoughts now appear as if falling upon these objects as if striking at them as if confronting them again and again. Then as a rule his mind will no longer go elsewhere. Only occasionally and in a slight degree will this happen and even in those cases he will be able to notice any such stray thought at its very arising as expressed in common speech or to be exact he will notice the stray thought immediately after its actual arising. Then that stray thought will subside as soon as it is noticed and will not arise again. Immediately afterwards he will also be able to resume continuous noticing of any object as it becomes evident to him. That is why his mind at that time is called unhindered.,Meditation,cx53uzq,1,t5_2qnc9

5805737,0,t1_cxgpkf7,gt I guess all that is left is to surrender completely. What do you think?This surrender to pain mantra is popular nowadays but I dont see it that way. Suffering results from a contracted identity that is to say we are not reasoning about ourselves properly we do not see the world as it truly is. We are not what we think we are and when we identify with what we are not that causes friction which results in suffering. Surrendering to pain is not the solution because pain is a signal that something is wrong. We have to realize and surrender to what is right and true  and not keep surrendering to what is wrong.  When theres a fire alarm you wouldnt say just surrender to the sound of the fire alarm  you would instead look for an escape. Wanting more pain is also not the solution its just egos desperate attempt to stay in control and retain some freedom. Theres no easy way out but if you ask me the first step is to see how impossible this situation really is! You cant surrender to it and you cant make it go away. You just cant surrender to pain. Pain is by definition something that makes it impossible to surrender to it. If we could surrender to it it wouldnt be true suffering. What a man can hope for is to discover a part of her self that never suffers  and keep rediscovering it until you identify with it completely. The  Katha Upanishad statesgtThe wise who know the Self bodiless seated within perishable bodies great and all pervading grieve not. Then a wise man through the practice of discrimination has seen clearly the distinction between body and Soul he knows that his true Self is not the body though It dwells in the body. Thus realizing the indestructible allpervading nature of his real Self he surmounts all fear of death or loss and is not moved even by the greatest sorrowAndgtKnowing That which is soundless touchless formless undecaying also tasteless odorless and eternal beginningless endless and immutableAnd gtBecause of its extreme subtlety it cannot be heard or felt or smelled or tasted like any ordinary object. It never dies. It has no beginning or end. It is unchangeable. AndgtKnowing that the senses are distinct from the Atman and their rising and setting separate from the Atman a wise man grieves no more. A wise man never confounds the Atman which is birthless and deathless with that which has beginning and end. Therefore when he sees his senses and his physical organism waxing and waning he knows that his real Self within can never be affected by these outer changes so he remains unmoved.And then true surrender takes place but it is not surrender to pain  it is surrender to its opposite to blissgtIt cannot be understood through study debating intellectual application or mere listening. When a soul surrenders wholeheartedly it receives Grace of the Self or Atman The Atman Self reveals Itself freely to such a person. ,Meditation,cxgr8wu,16,t5_2qnc9

Dont meditate dont do anything other than notice how your breathing naturally readjusts.  This exercise is useful in exploring what control and observation feels like.

We often look at things and the mind often reacts to whatever it is based on our conditioning perceptions views  beliefs etc which in turn makes us see it the way the mind wants to see it which is often in a judgmental or one dimensional way. But if we lift the veil of mind and begin living fully in the present moment we start to see beyond the illusions and conceptualizations that our mind creates and see things in their pure form exactly as they are with no bias or judgement. Life then becomes a lot simpler and far more enjoyable.

Given this lion morals would cause it great suffering. Like the story of adamampeve given it knowledge of right and wrong would be the only way to destroy its harmony with life and nature. It would live in resistance to it thinking something was wrong with itself never being as it should be. Suddenly the lion is no longer a lion it only looks like one.

6058982,0,t3_3yigju,During meditation you are trying to get a full sense of body awareness through the breath. For informal meditation you try to keep that awareness while you try to go through your normal activities.Heres an excerpt from this book  gtDont let your awareness of the visual field crowd out your awareness of the bodyfield. And dont let your concern for your next activity cause you to drop your awareness of the breath energy in the body. Try to maintain that sense of fullbody awareness as consistently as you can. You may not be able to keep track of the inandout breath as you engage in other activities but you can maintain an overall sense of the quality of breath energy throughout the body. Keep it relaxed and flowing. Notice when you lose your awareness of it notice how you can regain it. Try to keep the sense of awareness of the breath energy in the body as constant as you can until the next time you sit down to meditate. This way you maintain a solid nourishing foundation for the mind as you go through the day. This gives you a sense of groundedness. That groundedness provides not only a sense of security and inner ease but also a basis for observing the movements of the mind. This is one of the ways in which steady mindfulness and alertness form a foundation for insight.,Meditation,cydttxa,1,t5_2qnc9

Mentally is where it has to change. When you can look at the same situation with different eyes and an open heart you will know you have changed. That sticks with me and I can say I have changed from black to white and I now look at my situation completely differently than how I did. And every time I tell my self that there is no more I can learn there always is more. Im a firm believer in you are exactly where you are suppose to be to learn exactly what you need to learn. And when you have gotten all you need than you move on And not a second before. So if I can give you a small piece of advice it would be to learn to be patient.

It is sort of like when you stare at an object without moving your eyes things start to become blurry and colors can start to disappear but that same sensation is happening in my arms and legs. I start to feel like my arms and legs are floating soothing sensation in my arms and legs as they become desensitized because Im not moving them at all for a long period of time. Its not painful like your leg going to sleep or anything like that but it feels nice in a way since it is a unique sensation that you usually only get with your eyesight when you try to stare at something without blinking for a long period of time but you are feeling that same sort of thing in your arms and legs and body.,Meditation,cysr7ye,1,t5_2qnc9

6237289,0,t1_cyydgvu,Definitely theres no end to the journey.  Its also important to recognize that ultimately liberation from the bondage of the self is also liberation from guidebooks and a direction for how the unfolding manifests or the road traveled after realization. Its easy to get caught up in doing things the way youve read about other enlightened sages do them and comparing your experience to theirs and expecting your realizations to parallel theirs. Rather than experiencing things afresh from a position of complete openness you judge your experiences and behaviours on your prior conditioning and again introduce duality and a struggle to achieve perhaps some more perfect way of viewing things or acting.In my case meditation moved from a formal timed meditation practice to a presence and stillness with life as it unfolds in every moment. The greatest understanding I find comes from living in the spiritual marketplace. It would be easy to just go off to some cave or monastery and be with the realization but I find that I learn the most about the movements of the ego and thoughtsactions misaligned with truth by watching what arises as the bodymind engages in everyday living. I find insights come from the everyday.As an example I started this thread wanting to see how it would go asking people an innocuous question then if they were interested in enlightenment questioning them about what they thought it was and further questioning their responses to perhaps get them to challenge their ideas about it maybe saving them years of unnecessary floundering. I recognize that people who may be spiritually prideful dont always take to questioning and as you said people generally dont like unsolicited advice. However some people who are earnest in seeking welcome the chance to explore the concepts theyre currently holding onto.Its also helpful for me to explore both my ability to point to the truth and to see where people are and the beliefs or issues that are holding them back from realizing their true nature in this very moment.,Meditation,cyym1sr,1,t5_2qnc9

6336449,0,t3_42euep,gtCertain mental health problems increase the risk of adverse effects from mindfulness.Right so there are misunderstandings here. The whole point behind all of this is that the thoughts from the brain come automatically we cant shut them up but we choose what we listen to and take meaning to. When we take meaning in something we achieve an emotional reaction.This emotional reaction then will feed back into our thoughts and a strengthening of this is real and how things definitely are occurs. If you get caught in the wrong loops it is going to make you feel crazy. Meditation is practicing this in a controlled environment so that when you are in a difficult environment you have better control over what thoughts you give meaning and hence alter your emotional reaction.Mindfullness is the process of living in the present moment. To recognize that the future does not exist that it only arrives in the now. If someone is identifying with insanity then that is their current state and they may feel like it wont pass and that noticing it being mindful is what caused it to happen. This isnt what is happening... its always been there... its just now that you are aware of it.Once you are aware of something then you can do something about it. People get to the first step and then complain why arent I fixed yet? why is this painful? Because you are uncovering somethings that have been automatic and hidden for the most of your life! Having a good teacher will help a lot with this.,Meditation,cz9vuk6,13,t5_2qnc9

6359441,0,t3_42pxfm,I used meditation to overcome the majority of my bipolar depression. It allowed me to identify the feelings of anger or despair and isolate them from myself.Using psychedelics though is not a reliable way to meditate. While reality itself is illusory and changing its magnified when on hallucinogens nothing you experience while on those is real outside of direct interaction. The things you will see or hear those are complete fabrications of an altered state of being essentially an altered reality.Meditation especially those that search for identification with oneself are a largely ignored boon that far too many do not even attempt because it never occurs to them that something mental can really only be resolved by something else equal to it essentially mental.

This kind of overbearing acceptance means you ascribe a layer of meaning to something that is purely made up and probably wont serve you very well.Understanding that you dont always have immediate conscious control over everything is a kind of acceptance too but the underlying intention of sorts is that you can feel free of the need to try and control everything without concluding that youre completely stuck forever with what you cant control right now.,Meditation,czmf17e,1,t5_2qnc9

6493418,0,t3_44kmfo,gt Is this a bad thing or am I going crazy?Does your behavior cause problems to you and others? Does your behavior make people around you uncomfortable? Does your constant incentive to offer financial help cause problems for you?If it is then its time to reconsider your behavior. Whether a certain behavior is bad or good is never an absolute thing. You have to decide that on a case by case basis.As I see it it really helps to be analytical about it. Sometimes we have feelings urges and impulses. Just because you have them doesnt mean its a smart idea to follow up on them. Just because you have the impulse to be selfless and give money doesnt mean its a good idea to do that.I would recommend that you get used to thinking those decisions through. When you notice that you are overwhelmed by an impulse for selfless behavior I would recommend that you stop and sleep over it. Think through the implications and possible problems of going through with your decision. The person you want to help will be there the next day and the decision you make after thinking about it analytically will be much better in the end.,Meditation,czqyuit,3,t5_2qnc9

6640003,0,t1_d0643fs,Well this is huge discussion in and of itself regarding best possible life path. I think experience is our best teacher. I would say that our best path is at our highest potential. We can still do great without achieving it but it is hard to follow the advice of a drunkard. He may still be right about many things but I think we have to be able to show not just tell. Who am I to say anything isnt exactly where it is supposed to be even if it could be better? I think all I can do is what everyone else is doing living life according to what I feel is best based on my limited experience. If Zen helps one purge of harmful dogma and selfrighteousness and illwill then that is what is best for that person.

6664739,0,t3_46xgqp,I get this too sometimes. I know its my ego taking the form of a doubter so it never lasts long but be assured that this kind of questioning will come up many times during your journey. How do you know this is right? What if its wrong?What saves me from falling down that trap is first hand experiences that taught me that rational truth is non existent. The brain and modern society tend to depend on a form of judgement similar to logical positivism. If logical positivism worked as a truthfinding mechanism then coherent problems could always be reduced to logical formulas judgements like good and bad would presumably make rational sense and the universe wouldnt be so confusing.But the truth seems to be that logic is useful but it isnt true in the sense that nature is true. Truth is fuzzy it is rarely rational and it sure as hell doesnt care about good or bad. But WE do it is our nature to desire positivity.When you are mindful you dont have to depend on thoughts on rationality and you then can make the choice what you believe good to be. You dont have to be healthy you dont have to be a helpful member of your community. But the universe the dao the path of least resistance seems to favour those who are healthy and who do help others.So why not cheat and be that person? Our experience is an illusion anyway. Youre just an actor and life is a play. So play. ,Meditation,d08owo7,6,t5_2qnc9
6666249,0,t1_d05wss4,Absolutely! Interestingly I would say a TRUE victim tends to have feelings and therefore thoughts and actions that are not victimization but often something else I.e. Fear guilt etc. and may attract more of that unfortunately until it is dealt with and a narcissist may yes unfortunately have many things happen that support that narcissistic view as well which is why it often builds although those with narcissistic and competitive tendencies may have seeds of doubt that bring about other things OR those also selfdestructive and might have things that attract selfdestruction.

I would be sitting on the train doing nothing but inside my head I would have a billion thoughts a minute. I still have lots of thoughts some of them completely illogical. It still causes anxiety but I can notice it now.I also seem to get anxious when I cant stay in the moment which is blocking me.

Like you could make thousands of interpretations of that single thought if you use that kind of thinking. I could say money is made of paper and is also green. Perhaps your mind is concerned with someone eating or consuming your money. What I would say is your random thoughts are just typical mental chatter. Your mind is always going to be thinking. If you want to stop your thoughts killing yourself will be much faster and easier. What you want to learn is how to not get caught up or invested in these random thoughts. Just let them exist but dont get lost in them. Id say what the other guy is telling you to do is actually a very bad idea as you will end up getting very very lost in mental chatter.

6954658,0,t1_d148wlr,Also Im sorry if I confused you by suggesting that I had experienced some sort of objective truth through meditation.  I dont think I said that and I certainly dont cling to any view of there being any objective truth.  Theres experience that arises and passes away.  Theres a seeming place where that experience arises from and passes away to.  These descriptions are just convenient ways of pointing to the actual experience not anything real in themselves and its only through our conceptualization of this process  which is just a conceptualization  that we come to any view of truth or philosophy or other such ideas.  Theres nothing wrong with any of it.  Science is great.  Religion is great.  All of these concepts are fun to play with.  Ideas are fun.  Personally I love ideas.  I love questioning.  I love exploring frameworks and thinking about them and playing with them.  But none of them are clinged to as substantial permanent actually existent realities. That view  which is just another view  has a nice feeling of openness and freedom associated with it.  It extends rather than limits possibility.  Its just one way of looking but its worth trying it on like a piece of clothing and see how the clothing fits.  You might like.  You might also realize that the other clothes your wearing views that you take to be yourself  or your skin  are actually just more clothes you can take off and put on. Long story short try and have an open mind.  You dont have to.  You can have a closed mind.  You can adopt any view you want and not spend anytime trying to distinguish views or identifying views that are not clearly seen as views.  Its entirely up to you.  But if you have a regular meditation practice youre likely to gradually open up to more views.  ,Meditation,d14n6gy,1,t5_2qnc9

6972491,0,t3_4awtdo,These are some quotes from a Tibetan master Lamrimpa.Lethargy and laxity are companions. Laxity leads lethargy follows and they both run in the same direction.In meditation the sequence of arising of these various mental factors has a definite pattern imagine starting with a good strength of clarity of mind which degenerates to a point where laxity arises laxity follows its course giving rise to lethargy lethargy follows its course leading into sleep it is a natural progression.I found them helpful. The idea being that the clarity and vividness of comprehension is important also. How vivid is the object how interesting is it as it is perceived moment to moment. After a while when you get a bit of confidence in concentration practice a kind of complacency can set in. Its like oh yeah the breath I got this no problem. there it is. Im at stage  etc now after all. This confidence can make you slack off a bit in a subtle way leading to a halfassed engagement this leads to dullness then a slippery scale to sleepiness. So maybe working on the quality of that attention could help. Refreshing your interest on the inbreath and relaxing on the out breath. Not just focusing on the breath but ensuring a continuous interest in it. Making the breath the most interesting thing ever. That could be one cause. So its not a real tiredness just a mental state that is a reaction to a lack of interest.Another thing that makes me sleepy is if the air is too warm.It could also be a physical thing hard to know really. But I have heard that once you get to a stage of continuous engagement its a good idea to then try to refine that by working on improving the clarity and vividness of your engagement with the object. Making sure its not a dull comprehension or a complacent one maybe.,Meditation,d16o3jk,2,t5_2qnc9

Bowingprostration practice is revered as a precious medicine a supreme method in times of crisis as well as an excellent everyday pillar of practice. Its benefits are almost too many to recount.

7173015,0,t1_d1qp0ah,For me it is simple. If someone believes in something hes not right nor wrong.For example One is born in christian family. He believes in god and if I ask him if god exists...he would say it does. Than on the other hand one is born in muslim family. He believe in alah and if I ask him if he exists...he would say again it does. Than lets ask christian guy if he was born in muslim family. Would he believe in god or alah? Probably alah and same thing would happen if we ask muslim guy.I was born in christian family but I dont believe in god although i went trough the whole process of christianity. But if I ask my mother if he exists she would say he does. Is she right or wrong? I dont know because I dont believe in that but probably someone would agree with her.There is more than billion people in this world. Some people believe in god and some in alah. Some dont believe in anything but some do believe in demons. If you believe in such things i do believe that anything is possible for them. They could see demons although they were not actually there. Or they could be there you see Im not sure and noone is.If i conclude everything...i believe that if someone believes in such things that theyre real they could really be for them.

7176040,0,t3_4drnc2,Im also new to meditation here about  months. I think its important to manage your expectations. It might be counterproductive to meditate in order to reach lofty goals like attaining enlightenment or to immediately eradicate anxiety or depression. Even if meditation could do this it would likely a very long time. Rather I meditate because Ive found that over time I have slightly more peace of mind slightly more presence and slightly more resilience to painful emotions. And you dont need to feel anything special when you meditate I have never felt anything close to selflessness or enlightenment. But I have had many moments of presence of calm and of deep contentedness with the present moment.Ive been reading The Mind Illuminated highly recommended by the way and my favorite part of the book so far is the focus on intentions. You sit with the intention of focusing on the breath while letting all distractions emotions come and go without judgement and no matter what when you realize your mind has wandered congratulate yourself for waking up and be kind to yourself as you bring attention back to the breath. It is the intention that is most important not the quality of the meditation. If you have the right intentions and put in the time the results will come. And lastly if you dont find meditation pleasurable at least sometimes I would recommend changing up how you do it. Meditation should be a time for yourself to enjoy. Sometimes its incredibly difficult and sometimes even unpleasant but I dont think it should be like that all the time. If it is I would try to change up your routine maybe trying a different type of meditation. And if you find that no matter what you do meditation is not enjoyable for you  I would stop and try again at a later point in your life. Your well being is more important than meditating for the sake of meditating.Also  Im sure everybody who meditates sometimes questions whether they are getting better and feel like giving up so youre not alone. But many of those people continue and ultimately do reap the benefits of meditation. Maybe somebody with more experience than I have can weigh in.Good luck!,Meditation,d1tulsx,1,t5_2qnc9

7398808,0,t1_d2j34uz,One of the things that tends to happen in meditation is that our attention tends to stabilize particularly if we work at it.   There comes a point in the practice where the attention is sufficiently stable that the mind starts to lose energy because there is nothing for it to do.   This is a very pleasant relaxing state but its not the end goalits just a nifty intermediate result.Some characteristics of this state are that the meditation seems not to take very long and if there is a sound in the environment it tends to be mildly startling.   I sometimes get a flash of patterned visuals when theres an abrupt sound while Im in this state but I dont know if thats common.Anyway to get past this milestone in your practice you have to notice that you are heading toward this state before you get there because once in it its relatively difficult to get out until youve trained yourself to do it.The way to avoid getting to this state is to do something to keep your mind active.   The best way to do this is to cultivate awareness.  Your mind perceives the world in two different ways through attention and through awareness.   In modern times attention tends to be much more prevalent and we tend not to even be aware of the distinction.In meditation you can cultivate awareness at first by simply noticing whether you are aware of outer objects like sounds and the feeling of your body.   Its possible to keep your attention on the meditation object e.g. the breath while still being aware of your environment.   You can also meditate with your eyes open although this can be too distracting.As you cultivate awareness and your energy level remains steady instead of dwindling as you become focused it can be difficult to reach the same stability that you reached when awareness was shut down.   This can feel like backsliding but its notyouve just made the problem of remaining stable on the object harder.   But you know how to do it so if you persist you can reach a state where your awareness is still broad and strong and your attention is stable.The way you do this is that once youve learned to keep your awareness broad as you try to stabilize your attention you start to use your awareness to notice what is happening in your mind rather than what is happening in your outer environment.   You train your awareness to notice if you are becoming distracted and to correct for it.   You train it to notice if you are becoming dull and correct for it.   When this becomes second nature you wont have trouble maintaining strong energy in the mind while at the same time maintaining stability of attention.,Meditation,d2j71x9,2,t5_2qnc9

It is a problem of realisation.And theres a real difference between having it and realising you have it. Its called ignorance.So what if you have your spectacles resting on top of your head? If you dont realise it you dont realise it. And so you search. The table? Nope. The drawer? Nope.You scratch your head in frustration. Aha! Enlightenment.The searching is the path. Just like you cant notice pure white unless its contrasted with other colours you need paths to enlighten you to home.And just like all colours are needed all paths are needed. Because everyone can only walk their own unique path no one can walk it for them. Saying one possible path is superior to another possible path is utter rubbish. We must make available all paths to all people.Because it is not the path that is the most important. It is the people. We must make available all paths to all sorts of people.

7493787,0,t3_4i0cbb,First make sure that youre using an established technique.  Where did you find your meditation instructions?  Its important to be clear on your instructions at the outset.  That will help avoid a number of problems.  The FAQ here has some decent resources to guide you in the right direction. Second your conception of the practice could use some tweaking.  Dont expect meditation alone to change the way your mind works.  If you tend to think a lot odds are that you will continue to think a lot regardless of meditation.  Meditation however makes you aware of your thoughts.  Its the difference between noticing that thoughts are arising and being trapped in the thought stream without being aware that youre trapped there.  By noticing thoughts as temporary arisings your relationship to them will change which ultimately will likely lead to more fundamental changes in your default habit patterns.  But that takes time and the fundamental tool toward dissolving old default habit patterns of mind is awareness of those patterns which meditation helps you to develop.  The two things are connected but maybe not in the way that you think.   As another example its somewhat like listening to music.  There are two ways to listen to music   being totally absorbed by the music which happens when you like the song and  allowing the music to fade into the ambient background experience.  With thoughts the default pattern of humans seems to be to always keep the thought stream at the level of   total absorption or something close to it.  In fact that default state is so pernicious that when you first realize that thoughts can actually be like state  ambient background thought noise that can be a mindblowing realization.  For those who have not reached a level in their practice to experience this shift in awareness from the thinker of thoughts to the observer of thoughts it might even seem inconceivable. Its actually not that hard.  Thats where meditation will take you.  But like sound or music or any other arising experience you dont really control whats presenting to your mind as thought any more than you control the sound of the birds chirping outside.  If you want to relax your thinking or worrying you need to learn to let the thought stream fade into the background.  The less you expend energy on the thought steam the less loud it will be seem to be in your mind.  Thats one way to help deal with overthinking.  It might remain present but it will be quieter more in the background.  And depending on how much you focus your concentration on foreground activities you might occasionally not even notice it at all for some period of time.  Another way to deal with overthinking or thinking problems and I think the most important way is to really start to work on morality and virtue.  If you punch somebody in the face and watch them experience pain you wont be able to control being tortured by thoughts of that experience.  If you help a person in need youll feel great and thinking about that experience will only make you feel good.  So if one problem of yours is that you tend to have thoughts that are irritating annoying or stressful then one way you can deal with that without eliminating thought altogether is to start to get your act together.  Being kind loving and compassionate isnt just a thing that hippies suggest because they are hippies and weird.  Its a very practical component of a practice designed to relieve YOURSELF from suffering.  The more you meditate the more aware you will become of this simple truth.  Getting angry because your stuck in traffic sucks and then it continues to suck even after youre out of your car.  Learning to let go be kind relax wish peace for others are all effective strategies for making yourself feel better. So just some things for you to consider as you continue your practice. ,Meditation,d2u04zc,16,t5_2qnc9

What made me want to stop was when I decided you know what tonight I wont get high. That night was spent sweating and not getting any sleep which made me realize how bad the situation was. I eventually turned to meditation and after a couple years of it I can now smoke casually  times every two weeks and not feel the need to do it more. As a matter of fact it is declining since I receive the benefits of weed from meditation school work and more. Anyways what really helped me was regular exercise.

8016069,0,t1_d4h0vdy,The experience is termed egodeath in psychedelicuser vernacular. In my reading there are gradients to the degree of ego loss during such an experience. For me it was just a forgetting of who I was. I found myself asking Who am I? and as I was looking at other people Who are they?. There was this inherent sense that I was not who I took myself to be. Some people particularly higher dose trips report complete transcendence  beyond space and time no visions total annihilation of self void completely gone. What remains is a feeling of boundless awareness and a feeling of being the entirety of existence. I think most psychedelic users cannot make sense of these experiences and so never actualize the abiding nondual awareness that the experience is pointing to.

At first though it may seem like there are even more thoughts. What may be happening is not that theres more thoughts youre just noticing individual thoughts rather than them being the background hum of your day to day existence.

8783808,0,t1_d72xud7,Yeah I have some experience. .  There is no moral reason why being addicted to psychedelics is wrong it just that the lives of folks addicted to Acid dont usually include as much happiness as those addicted to meditation.  LSD can lead you to great places but also can lead you astray. .  I think doing psychedelics works really well I am not against it but it has real negatives that you should think about before doing.  Getting a glimpse ahead can be a great motivator but it can also turn meditation into a frustrating effort to get back somewhere and that is tough to break through. .   My point here is that it is all just electrical activity in the brain.  When meditating sober that is easier to keep front of mind.  When it feels like energy is pulsating through you and you are becoming one with the universe it is hard to remember that actually nothing is happening and it is all in your head.  If you can stay present and trip hard you can go really far but many more people end up believing crazy shit from tripping. ,Meditation,d73ncr8,1,t5_2qnc9

It flies by.From then just get in the habit of doing a little and often. Add in some guided meditations to mix it up a bit. Ive found guided meditations go much quicker than simply sitting. Dont try jamming in a  minute session. Itll just put you off. Do  minute. Or even  seconds!

Im with you in a lot of ways. My biggest enemy is also expectations.   Ive quit meditation many times for not having the experience Im looking for at the depth that I want it. Once I stayed away for a whole year. But I keep coming back to it because living life from the perception of being separate from everything else is painful. The buddha wasnt kidding around when he said life is suffering. People try and fix it with power money food sex drugs etc. Netflix binges haha. But those things dont fix it. When theyre gone that feeling that somethings missing that there should be something more is still there. A fundamental sometimes profound feeling of being unfulfilled.  Im either very lucky or totally cursed that I believe meditationsitting is the only real way out of it. The only way out of that basic misconception. But the expectations looking for something is its own barrier one I seemingly cant put aside. When people say It will give you nothing it is absolutely true in the most fundamental way possible. It will not give you anything that you dont already have. It wont turn you into someone you arent already. But its also NOT true because there is a world of difference between thinking that you are separate from everything else and liberation from that delusion.  Maddening.  I dont have any advice.

As someone who struggled with the same question you had for a long time over the years I realized that my fixation on becoming smarter was actually hindering me. Dont think of being smart like a stats in a video game. Being smart is largely based on good habits and how you use your time.  If you want to perform well academically the importance of sleep exercise proper diet and meditation cannot be overstated. As well devoting more time to practicing a certain subject will make you smarter at it.Sometimes things in life are paradoxical. When you struggle to understand something youre learning sometimes its more helpful to actually take a break rather than trying to brute force the information into your brain. Likewise the fixation on cognitive betterment may not give you what you desire.Its easier said than done but you have to be more immersed in the process rather than the results. Youll realize that the people who you may consider to be smart are those who ENJOY the learning process and that good grades simply become a byproduct of doing what they do often. Try to have fun with learning rather than seeing it as a means to an end.,Meditation,d88n00l,1,t5_2qnc9
9131092,0,t1_d89eni6,I think this places too much emphasis on the process and not the desired result. This can lead to attachment as well. Consider this passagegt Maitreya said A path has to be abandoned. Path is like a boat you go to the other shore use the boat you reach the other shore. What do you do? You abandon the boat. You dont stand on the boat because boat looks beautiful. Because otherwise you are not on the other shore. Yes the boat looks beautiful boat is so smooth and you had the best time with this boat. But your aim is to reach the other shore. Likewise when you reach the buddhahood not only the Vajrayana all the other yanas are gone. Has to be.I think we both agree focus and progress are important.

The deeper you go the more intense the light gets. When I first got these I started sweating a lot and it felt like I forcefully looked in to Sun or other too bright source of light except that it gave the sensation of much more than just regular light.Other experiences I feel when the light appears are kind of moving tendrils or rays of light that wave around coming from the circle.

And repeat. At first you feel like you are pushing thought out constantly but at some point your mind clicks and you do it continuously. Pretty much this links to being permanently focused on the breath but the other way around. You keep refocusing until youre automatically focusing on breath as your main priority and you and your self are secondary. Not unlike the feeling of being engrossed in a video game.I personally try to fixate on the breath and imagine that nothing else exists but the sensation and everything else can be ignored.

9175842,0,t3_55rgoi,For whats its worth Ive been there. I just want to say that you can actively do your best to improve all these things. A job a social life happiness its not innate. People think that all these things happen love is a good example. Some people believe in falling love like its out there and all you have to do is just stumble upon it the same goes with happiness. If I get X or become Y Ill finally be happy. No happiness love these are states of being you actively engage in. You choose to be happy and you work hard to be so. That was the realization I made that drew me out of depression. I recognized to some extent it was neurological so I took the medicine and did CBT and then I recognized that I wasnt going to get better unless I chose too so I did what I had to do to get out and stay out of that cycle of despair.  This is just my journey yours might be different. I know that even today I will fall into depression if I dont actively manage my life correctly. Meditation is one tool out of a set of strategies I have to make sure that I never get to that point again. ,Meditation,d8f3sx4,2,t5_2qnc9

We live in a society of workaholics so it is expected you will feel different. I also had similar depression and anxiety as you did. I learned I had to structure my life with a lot of this time in order to feel mentally healthy and I can tell you it is possible!Not sure what career you chose I picked the arts. But what you can do is first decide to live modestly and within your means. That way you will not be in the rat race to pay of credit cards for crap you dont need or to fulfill some existential lack.Second advice I can offer is understand it might take a few more years to reach the financial milestones your peers will. I lived at home a lot longer in order to save money so I wouldnt have the stress of bills.Decide to focus on your mental health as a priority for worklife balance eat well take time to prepare good food sleep and have rampr. And meditation time of course!I have had the kind of work that allows me to take time when I need to. Maybe it means I am not top in my field or the highest paying in my field. But for me that is okay. I find satisfaction in my work and peace in my life. I let the other hyper ambitious people go after happiness their own way. tldr You dont have to do  grind. I freelance and work short term projects as an artist and my spouse also works on projects this way. We have a lot flexibility with our time and we live within our means.

But even the introductory material didnt really appeal to me.For now Ive accepted that Im not mentally stable enough to study in a way thats compatible with my mental health. But really even if I were I doubt I would have a lot of motivation.Really my intuitive drive is to do something entirely different. As you say not just soak up endless amounts of knowledge that end up being not all that significant on a deep level. Instead genuinely bringing kindness and wisdom into the world developing my own mind and heart and helping others to do the same.Id like to work in alternative education something like a sudbury school for example or do life coaching or something like that. I would also like to have timemoney to do charitable work in one way or another.Certainly easier than done...For now I am just grateful I am secure in terms of my material needs until I have some level of stability and hopefully motivation to allow me to provide for myself.Being labeled mentally ill is not a pleasant experience at all but it does have the very substantial benefit that youre being let off the hook in terms of needing to earn your own money.,Meditation,d9kje65,1,t5_2qnc9

9638297,0,t3_5d09a0,I dont know what you mean by self awareness.   Mindfulness is a skill that you develop in meditation.   In order to develop shamata you develop and refine introspective awareness which is an automatic watching of the activities of the mind.   As you progress in your development of shamata this awareness becomes more and more powerful until you reach the point where you are aware of what is going on in the mind and why it is going on spontaneously all the time.At the same time you are developing the ability to intentionally put your attention on any object and have it stay there without moving until you decide to move it.The combination of these two skills produces mindfulness a state of mind where you are broadly aware of what is going on at any given time and able to direct your attention skillfully.   This enables you to make a very good guess as to what to do at any given moment if there is something that needs to be done and of course also to avoid doing something when it needs to not be done.   The stronger your mindfulness the better able you are to do this.As for selfawareness it might be analogous to the introspective awareness that I described but as far as I know its a psychology term that doesnt have a direct analog in meditation practice.,Meditation,da14a8b,2,t5_2qnc9

9758627,0,t3_5ex8cz,Yes.It was very difficult. Eventually I began to visualize my thoughts as though they were tangible items swirling around my physical body. They came and went and spiraled around me like some sort of cosmic dance. With time I felt more and more separated from my thoughts. I was merely observing them. I also felt as though there was no separation between my being and the air that surrounded me just oneness with all.I had lots of experience with LSD before this. At the time I was just beginning to get serious about my meditation practice so combining them felt right.It was a really interesting exercise for me and I took a lot from it. Since then I have meditated again while on LSD but usually while coming down as opposed to peaking.My experience was positive but like I said Ive had a lot of experience with psychedelics. I think a more novice user might have more difficulty disconnecting from ones thoughts while tripping even somebody who already has a meditation practice. It took a lot longer than l expected to find a place where I was physically comfortable with sitting for a long period of time.

Seems like many redditors cling to traditional beliefs in the form of dogma like mindfulness without even realizing theyre doing it. And chakras are real but not special? Seems like if they are real theyre pretty special. Im curious whats the basis for your seemingly arbitrary claims here? Is this some kind of traditional wisdom youve received? If so what tradition are they specific to?OP in my experience chakras can be powerful but Id argue the opposite of the other commenter Id say dont believe some specific parts of the theory just because theyre traditional.

When I think of happiness in the context of lovingkindness meditation I dont think of getting what you want like a kid at Christmas because that kid at Christmas is always cranky and dissatisfied three hours later right? but of being at peace with oneself of being free from the toxic ego stuff. And I genuinely wish that for the people I dont get along with or the people I think will do harm to myself and others because I think that if they got to that place they would do less damage  and they would be happier in a more genuine way.

Kundalini is shakti energy that enters through the soles of the feet and rises up the legs and pools at the base of the spine. It then rises up the body through a chimney called the shooshomna passing through the chakras and exits out of the crown chakra. Every living things has a least a trickle of kundalini flowing through it. It can cause movement in the body. I get this to with the head tilting up.

They do not tell you about mindfulness about concentration or about the techniques and insights related to Buddhisms right effort and right view respectively. There is no insight here about the nature of the mind nor about the nature of existence. Being a bit more serene in difficult situations takes a lot of time and a lot of work.Reading a sentence or watching a video will never change you. It will make you feel better for a few moments if you already feel good and worse for a few moments if you already feel bad either by guilt I cant do anything about the present situation but Im mad anyway Ill never be serene or simply rejection My mother is dead  well have fun thats not under your control.Edit and telling people they are in control of the response they give to the situation is really wrong.

Repetition is key do a half lotus every day for up to six months  or maybe less it depends and when you feel that youre ready try the full lotus. Its not recommended to hold a half lotus for more than  mins or a full for  minutes your ankles and knees will really start to hurt again minutes before that stage anyway.Also this is extremely importantdont try and do a full lotus unless youre flexible enough and your knees are able to touch the floor while in the position.

10273866,0,t1_dc8la7y,The basis for this whole thing is inner peace youre just making up excuses and rationalizations for why its alright for you to be pissed and why everyone else is also secretly pissed just like you are but using calmness as a way to disguise yourself. Come on man somewhere deep down you have to know that youre fooling yourself because you dont want to take responsibility for your emotions. Again the basis for all this is peace of mind. From this all good things spring. Youre caught up in everything else but the essentials. Its not about words or thoughts logic or concepts  these things have no value. You can be a great debater have a quick wit be very rational  that has never taken anyone to inner truth. It is of no worth its a juvenile thing. You dont win anything by forcing an argument everyone involved simply just dissipates energy for no reason and may even create suffering through aggression and irritation.The way youre talking is reminiscent of this Cult of Outrage that exists today where different groups will try to find some excuse to get collectively angry and throw their suffering onto other people. This is not the way. This isnt good for you or for anyone else. I dont absorb your negativity because I am at peace but people around you are affected by these kind of things. You will not create a good life for yourself by living this way. Thats the core of spirituality.

As far as the pain Im not a huge proponent of the idea that one needs to meditate in any one particular position.  There are many forms and poses for meditation and they key is less the pose and more the maintenance of awareness.  I have my own chronic pain that I deal with and I can tell you from first hand that there is something to be said about stepping into the fire.  Most people will reasonably jerk away from pain or try to distract themselves from it.  However if you kind of step into it notice it and willfully abstain from directing it your body will begin to naturally acclimate to it.

10443475,0,t1_dcrsu4e,Oooooo lets talk ego!! Cause I wanna explain why i know it is his ego.So I think the definition of ego tends to get muddled. Sometimes ego is commonly used to describe pride elitism and arrogance. Traditionally or at least to my awareness in these kinds of circles its strictly the personalityidentity construct of the mind. This is what I mean by its his ego.To deepen That construct is what says I am A you are B. It allows us to differentiate between the floor and our face. Its an absolutely integral facet of our mind and it usually operates without question which I believe attributes to much of the madness in our world especially with social media but thats a totally different conversation.He has identified himself as an awakened enlightened individual. As he stated dating nonawakened unenlightened people is undesirable. hes recognizing that hes dating those different than him. Although the only thing thats actually creating the notable difference is his ability to identify and categorize. If we stripped that ego ability from him I truly dont think he would give a flying fuck what that person is experiencing in regards to how woke they are.So by that definition his ego is the cause of his preferential troubles.

But you can have incredible experiences without any drugs through an openness invitation and thinking of phosphenes inner light color vision feeling in relation to phosphenes and the practice of nondesire towards everything except for nondesire of the meditation itself.

10486931,0,t3_5q2wsc,When I was in this situation before my awareness was sharp enough to dig deeper and continue to find sensation in the very subtle breath I tried two different things that both worked well.The first was to move awareness from the place you were watching the breath and starting exploring sensations elsewhere in the body e.g. body scanning. It seems a little strange or counterintuitive when youre used to trying to stick to a particular object of meditation like glue e.g. following the breath but its better to find other things to be mindful of than to start letting the mind wander aimlessly when youre confused about what to do with the breath having disappeared.The other thing you can do is take the concentration you gained watching the breath and cultivate it into jhana. If youre noticing illumination behind your eyelids appearing around the same time the breath seems to disappear try switching your attention to the illumination and bask in the warm feeling it engenders. If youre not seeing illumination try smiling and concentrating on the pleasant feeling of that smile. You can learn more about jhana elsewheretheres some good info out there already.EDIT The third option is you just keep your attention glued to the spot where you last felt the breath even if it seems to have disappeared or seems too faint to follow. Youll be confused because theres nothing to observe and your mind will wander e.g. Whered my object of meditation go? What do I do now?. Be mindful and note those thoughts then return to where the breath last was and repeat ad infinitum until you find the breath again. Just like youd be mindful of any other distraction that pulled you from the breath while you were still observing it you need to be mindful of the confusion that arises when you lose your object of meditation then return to where the breath was.,Meditation,dcwsx0s,2,t5_2qnc9

Were not really designed to be continuously attracted to the same partner since its not very good from an evolutionary standpoint. Anyway your issue is a very complex one. It could be a blockage you could simply just have low libido as some people do you could simply not be with someone who really turns you on very few women turn me on because both the inner and the outer needs to be attractive and so on. Generally meditation should allow you to be less controlled by your libido but it shouldnt really make it decrease. I suggest going to a doctor and being tested for various diseases as well as your testosterone level and metabolism. Low libido is natural in some people especially with age  but if it suddenly changes it could be the symptom of an underlying condition. ,Meditation,dd0mk11,1,t5_2qnc9

10541395,0,t1_dd2rlm5,I hear a lot of libertarians and even socialists wrestle with this question. I think it is born out of Capitalist ideas that the nature of life is more competitive than cooperative and those notions are born out of deeper ideas that arise from our basic understandings of biological evolution. However all of life operates more cooperatively and at a level of order far greater than any competition between members or even between species. Cooperation is preeminent in the natural order.My point is that youre right success generally comes at some cost to others but I would argue that that is a constraint of the systems we live in not a constraint inherent to nature. Part of my journey of mindfulness is about understanding that the way things are is not necessarily equal to the way things must be and learning how to pick up the good ideas and carry them forward while letting go of unhelpful ideas.,Meditation,dd2zgfo,9,t5_2qnc9

There isnt just one method to doing so. With that in mind this opens up a whole new world of techniques to try!! Mindfulness meditation seems to be the most popular right now as it should be for its scientifically backed benefits but there are other methods such as the one you mentioned about meditation on something. If there is a specific problem youre curious about applying meditation to a quick google search could probably give you some recommended techniques. But you could also try to just make up your own method based on what you think works for you. For example try meditating in a way so that all youre focusing on is the problem no other sensory perception. From there you can try different things  brainstorming and actively trying to solve the problem or trying to step back and be passive about it and naturally let any thoughts come to mind that might help.

11096151,0,t1_dephhcj,You wont get flamed for saying these things.  Traditionally meditation is practiced sitting however it can be done in a number of ways.  ie. lying down in a chair anything keeping the back straight and in alignment  The problem with lying down is that when beginning its easier to fall asleep this way because your body is used to sleeping when laying down and will associate the two. Breath is one of the easiest anchors thats why everyone says focus on the breath.  Breath also goes deeper than just the focus but the point of meditation is to retain focus on an anchor to still the mind.  Its ok to wander and notice different feelings sensations phenomenon or even thoughts and then come back to your anchor.  ,Meditation,depqm5n,3,t5_2qnc9

11107648,0,t3_5yfxjx,Im not sure why so many people are mentioning that meditation causes you to need less sleep. Disrupted and uncomfortable insomnia is not the same as waking up early feeling awake and refreshed. So I would exclude that hypothesis from the start.    I dont have experience with PTSD so my feedback is based on general experience but you can see what rings a bell and what doesnt.The first thing I can think of is that when you are very new to meditation the forced applied attention tends to cause an increase in active thinking. More specifically a kind of existential mindstate where you become obsessed with Why am I meditating? What is my goal? What is the self? Who is thinking these thoughts?. If you meditation is stormy like that I can imagine it spilling over into your sleep.    The second thing could be if your focus is too forced and controlled. Also common for beginners. If you dont just allow your mind to gradually slow down at its own pace but grab it by the neck slam it down and shout sit!. This is also a state of mind that can spill over into your sleep kicking you into awareness focussedness awakeness.    Its already good that you are meditating in the morning. I can imagine that your problem would be even worse if you meditate in the evening. Although... just for science you could try some evening sessions.    On a more generic note  If you feel convinced the meditation is causing the insomnia I guess you somehow feel a relationship between the two? What I would focus on is how exactly you feel when you cant sleep. What wakes you up? Is it a rambling mind? Is it an emptymind hyper focus? Is it just feeling awake and not tired? A strong emotion? A physical sensation too hot too cold sweaty cramps ...?    Once you can pin down a pattern in what it is that wakes you up I think you can try to figure out what aspect of your meditation could be causing that.,Meditation,der1j3b,2,t5_2qnc9
11107851,0,t1_deqyhed,I learn a few things while sitting. The first is how to reside in the body and not thoughts. What you describe about resuming focus on your breath is a skill that is learned through repetitionpractice.Another is to learn about my repeated thought patterns and fears. My practice sounds different from yours. In mine we specifically note the content of thoughts so that we see the most believed thought. Not to do anything with it we just become aware of what it is. That somehow naturally takes us to the thought underneath that. Usually ending in some fear.So without doing anything but being aware of specifically what the thoughts are and residing in body sensations we learn what our deepest fears are.Then throughout the day when we feel tension in the body body awareness being something that we learn by practicing it can be very easy to see that the tension is based on some fear.Language is hard...

11115295,0,t3_5ym872,In my opinion you have to make a certain mental framework for how you view yourself. On one hand you need to believe in the self conceptself esteem part of your mind that you are not broken and you do not need any fix. Even if objectively speaking these things obviously are broken you shouldnt make them into your selfconcept as this would hinder your progress. This is what MetalPhoenix is pointing at.On the other hand you should acknowledge in ANOTHER part of your brain that your brain is doing things that arent right. And yes from that perspective meditation in my opinion does target those problems in an effort to fix them. This is because you will be training your mind to become more efficient focused and aware. You would literally be changing your brains neural activation habits breaking the old unproductive ones.So yeah meditation IS the fix to your problems but keep in mind that you are perfect just the way you are right now and on the journey of becoming MORE perfect.

11163813,0,t3_5zdmyp,I dont talk about my personal practice but I can say something on the topic from the perspective of Mahayana Buddhism and especially Vajrayana Buddhism.Attachment to special powers and states is a very seductive and gripping obscuration. Even if ones hope for power isnt grand the subtle desire to become more special than others or gain some kind of leverage over them is a negative intent that ruins the purity of practice. Countless people through the ages have fallen prey to egocentric grasping while giving lip service to selfimprovement or spiritual unfoldment.See the thrilling story of Milarepa who started out as a dark malevolent sorcerer and eventually through the guidance of his teacher became a great saint.A Buddhist knows or should know that any selfcentered view or intent is inherently poisoned and leads to suffering for oneself and others. This is because the notion of self is already a delusion. All trouble we cause in the world comes from this one misunderstanding of who or what we really are which is why the Seven Points Of Mind Training states Drive all blames into one that is see all problems as rooted in attachment to the notion of selfhood.But if we turn that deluded view around and move in the direction of insight into self and in the direction of awakening and fulfillment and complete relief of suffering for all beings then the acquisition of power has a completely different meaning and effect. So not only can the door open to pursuit of power in paths that generate great compassionate vow for the sake of infinite beings one actually vows and intends to develop all supernatural powers in order to benefit others.It is not only a whim or personal decision but a solemn vow and contract with ones lineage and master to attain the siddhis mystic powers of great enlightening beings.We should realize that supernatural powers are just activities that are unusual to us and that we dont yet understand. To an infant their parent seems to have many magical powers the ability to manifest food the ability to appear from some other place the ability to communicate in extremely sophisticated ways by making sounds with the mouth etc. To a toddler the ability to tie shoes may seem otherworldly.And among adults there are some who seem to be exceptionally perceptive have astounding memories or have incredible ability to manifest wealth. Although the notion of the supernatural may not fit in with our personal philosophy we nevertheless encounter many abilities that seem astounding and so far inexplicable.Almost everyone who meditates with any depth will encounter new perception intuition or other special energy type experiences. All these things come from mind. Some many are illusory projections that arise when ageold patterns of mental suppression start to be relaxed and released. But some are authentic.For example there is a very broad spectrum of what we call concentration at one end is the first hint of ability to return from distraction then as one progresses in the training greater concentrative power arises in which one can become very clear and present with the object of concentration. This develops further into states of absorption and complete unity  subject and object become one.The upshot of this spectrum is the movement from effortful concentration in which one brings the attention back to the object back to an actual present and real thing through intuition in which ones intimacy with reality grows and is expressed more in ones daily activity to perception in which one sees reality directly instantly knowing many things that others are blind to.It is the great vow of Bodhisattva aspirants to travel the entire length of that spectrum and to develop all other beneficial powers for the sake of sentient beings.The basis of it all is love and compassion. For instance when holding his baby son or daughter a father may feel very deeply a vow arise in him I will do whatever it takes to benefit you. I will be the best man I can be for you. This is an aspect of the same loving mind only the Bodhisattva has that love for all beings independent of family creed race species and independent of others friendliness neutrality or hostility. This love and intent is regenerated and perfected to an exceptional degree. It never stops being increased.So the Bodhisattva aspirant develops all kinds of abilities to benefit others. At first maybe for many years or lifetimes one must become selfsufficient and very capable in the world so as not to ever burden others or have to comprise ones values. Also common human powers are honed and made exceptional evenmindedness and nonreactivity even in times of great strife or danger concentration constant joy tireless effort tremendous patience evergrowing wisdom in alignment with reality and so on.Then as ones practice moves into more rarefied territory which relatively few have achieved unusual abilities may start to become accessible.On occasion by reason of their karma it sometimes happens that common people will possess one or another of these abilities without having trained in meditation and other practices. This is where we find prodigies and geniuses like Mozart or Einstein or someone with intuitive or psychic ability.The practitioner who loves all beings as her children or parents may take a vow to endlessly develop all beneficial powers for the sake of others.Siddhis are categorized in two types general siddhis are extraordinary abilities ultimate siddhi is complete enlightenment.,Meditation,dexen30,9,t5_2qnc9

11190822,0,t1_df0fojr,Intention doesnt matter at least with mindfulnesszen. Youre doing a process and the process has consequences regardless of what you want. I started off with an intention for meditation and how I thought it worked. After a lot of time I realised none of that mattered.gt I looked at that link you posted and some people were mentioning integrating lovingkindnessmantra meditation into your practice and that just pure mindfulness meditation without the guidance of a qualified teacher could somehow lead one down the wrong road In that link the woman actually describes trying metta meditation and compares it to how it was early on Ive occasionally done metta meditation I assume there are different forms but I use videos on YouTube and tried it again last night. For some reason it affects me less now than it did a few years ago where the emotion would come on strong and affect me later into the day. Nowadays I can still sort of feel it but at maybe  of the intensity it was at before I find that with a lot of things. Once its over it dissipates and I just go on with my day feeling relatively unchanged.Metta meditation isnt actually generating emotion from out of the ether. Its pulling up emotion that is already inside you. After a lot of mediation this woman has noticed the effects of metta meditation have diminished. Thats because for years shes been purging and dulling her emotions with meditation so there is less left to produce during a metta session. If youre only doing  minutes a day I wouldnt worry about any of this. Its a very gradual basically imperceptible process if you dont meditate that much. Im just cautioning you if you want to spend a lot of time meditating. Thats a totally different ball game. ,Meditation,df0gsyp,1,t5_2qnc9

11375599,0,t1_dflbiag,gtWithout these things we are free to ride the wave of life wherever it takes us.The point is life becomes less of a ride. When you lose attachmentsdesires in life you simultaneously get less psychological satisfaction from achieving things. You literally just care less about what is going on. One important thing Ive learnt is everything comes from within your own mind. Everything you get out of life only exists within your own head apart from direct physical sensations. You get enjoyment and emotional payback from certain things because your ego has an attachment to them. When you degrade the attachment the enjoyment goes with it. gtIf you cling to plans or attachments even something you love then you cannot be free and should those things go wrong or disappear then you suffer.Its not just about clinging to attachments the attachments literally fade. You dont just have more of a mental ability to let things go that happens in the beginning the more meditation you do the more attachments get gradually weaker and weaker. Imagine if I told you that if you do enough meditation it would weaken the attachments you feel to the things you most love in your life. Would you consider that a good thing? For me personally I wouldnt have touched meditation with a  foot barge poll if I actually understood that. To me strong attachments are precisely what makes life meaningful. ,Meditation,dflekyn,1,t5_2qnc9

Underneath it all there is a temporal structure of what is experienced underneath that pure presence only obliquely accessible which is grounded in the concrete unity we can only ever conceptually separate as mind and body a unity of affectivity. These levels are mediated by  and gain their significance through  a fundamental caring engagement with the world we care about something an inthefirstcase biologicalsomething which does not diminish our nature as care in general.

Personally I practice metta and a form of breath meditation designed to sensitize you to pleasant breath sensations throughout the whole body. Theres alot to it but if youre interested you should look up with each and every breath by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. in addition to changing the method you can change your attitude. Try to appreciate all the positive aspects of your meditation session. You can either do this as they arise or as a reflection at the end of the session. Relish whatever degree of stillness and clarity you can cultivate no matter how small it is. Even following one complete breath cycle is a success.,Meditation,dgwcbq4,2,t5_2qnc9
