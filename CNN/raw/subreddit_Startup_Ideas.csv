First things first Have you spoken to different customer segments? If not thats what your launch should aim to achieve. If yes then your launch is all about targeting more of these guys. Generally the steps are a Hypothesise if you dont already know who would buy this. Being specific is good as long as you dont spend too much time. b Understand how to reach them. c Try to close them. In your case thats not a sign up or use itd be placing an order. If revenue is  priority a good start would be to find SMBs or ORGs that require custom shirts for their employees participants or would be easily sold on the idea. Then just make a call. Its crucial that you ONBOARD them yourself. Some examples.  A theatrical company?  A recreational theme park?  Schools trying new activities?  Event planning companies? Each one has their own segments. E.g Theatrical Plays for kids Vs Shakespeare company The pros about doing so are thata you will get some revenue b you will significantly speed up your understanding of who needs this. Maybe theatres are only printing seasonally but event planners every week. c You will quickly figure out what is cumbersome  great about your product to then compete with others if you decide after launching you will continue pursuing. On the other hand you can go BC. In both this case as well as above you will need to have your targets here a detailed persona defined. Could it be a gamer?Could it be a software developer? Who are the people that want to print quotes on shirts? Who are the people that want to have shirts with elaborate designs?After you decide who to target you need to figure out where they reside online is faster usually. For instance on gaming you could try Reddit groups related to games Reach out to Twitch fans Facebook ads  CPM target on interest gt ltnameOfGamegt and so forth.  is enough to get an idea and can happen in under hr. Write blog posts  create content that could appeal to that audience. e.g Best Tshirt designs for ltGameActivityPlaceholdergt FansPut an offline ad sticker in the area youre in with some catchy phrase I design your custom tshirt for ltbreakEvenNumbergt. CALL ltphonegt.  And many many more ways..If I were you I would try to find only a few people and try to close them individually. See the likes dislikes the resistance hows your UI working do they find the design part intuitive? How deep in the design do they go? maybe they only need to write text  Then you refine target and repeat I guess. By the way the business youre in has very little to do with the success youre going to have. just keep at it. Try to learn as much as possible as soon as possible and you will FIND your unique edge. Good luck. ,Startup_Ideas,d5g27y3,3,t5_30v06
