688004,0,t1_cgi0m3s,Certainly storage of spent fuel from the oncethrough process is cheaper for now.However we must realize that the current overabundance of baseload power fuels  namely the glut of natural gas  will taper off in not so many years.  And especially from a global perspective energy consumption will maintain a stark upwards trajectory due to emerging markets look at Chinas  new nuclear plants.When the energy markets restabilizes at environmentallyconscious price points read when fracking is legally restricted or reaches a point of diminishing returns then fission power should be poised to enter this favorable market.  Investing into research and firstgeneration breederburners i.e. ANLs Advanced Burner Reactor now will deliver economically and environmentally viable secondgeneration commercial plant designs hopefully in time for this reopening of the market.,NuclearPower,cgih7cq,1,t5_2s254

2047410,0,t3_2i6cea,The article does an interesting reframe of security and public access.On the topic of ethics and nuclear power  kindly critique my the following ideas  Nuclear power has a higher social responsibility compared to carbon fuels when measured in a global scale. Industrialized societies burn the majority of carbon fuels and reaping the benefits of our easy transportation and electronic gadgets. But who will pay the price of carbon fuels come climate change? Industrialized societies have the socialpoliticaltechnologicaleconomic infrastructure to better cope with sea level changes sea walls drought sophisticated irrigation modified agricultural patterns GMO. Less industrialized societies will have to deal with the same challenges  its called GLOBAL climate change for a reason but at a significant comparative disadvantage. Since nuclear power doesnt have a carbon impact were left with a small chance of a significant but largely LOCAL   accident. With nuclear the risks are more responsibilityfairly borne by those who benefit from its power.  What do people think?,NuclearPower,cl02kby,1,t5_2s254

6484885,0,t3_44crr0,You could probably do it but there wouldnt be much point since most salts have both higher melting points and worse neutronic properties for a fast reactor than lead. Sodium is even better but chemically reactive so I can see the argument for lead cooling but I cant see any reason to go from lead to presumably some kind of chloride salt in a fast reactor with metalclad oxide fuel. There are some fairly serious research efforts to develop lead cooled fast reactors and most of the technology is quite well understood already.,NuclearPower,czq32te,1,t5_2s254

7093412,0,t1_d1kdwfb,I did. Theres a certain reactor engineer who is very gung ho and a unit supervisor who puts a little too much trust in the REs in my opinion. This same thing happened a month later. And on that one the power rise was more than predicted and reactor pressure was within . psig of the upper limit. The crew wanted the RE to give guidance on whether to push peripheral rods or the center for they just pulled and the engineer left for a dentist appointment without telling anyone. They had to get the standby reactor engineer involved. Said engineer and unit supervisor got some coaching after that happened. ,NuclearPower,d1keo8n,3,t5_2s254

9082722,0,t3_54ockk,Yes but not direct. You would need equipment operator experience to be eligible to go to reactor operator class. And you would need a year of qualified RO experience to go to class for SRO. With an accredited  year engineering degree you can go SRO after  years or less directly. ,NuclearPower,d83lg61,6,t5_2s254

9328877,0,t3_5897eh,In zerog you have no natural convection taking away many of the best passive safety features of most designs.However any form of forced convection e.g. putting a pump into the coolant loop which you should already have many of will work just as fine as long as the pump works.Id say just about any design excluding BWRs should work fine. BWRs being advised against for the reason that nucleation works very different in zerog.PWRs LMFBRs just about anything with phase flow should be fine.  Im not even convinced that BWRs wouldnt work if you have sufficient pumping.,NuclearPower,d8yi4tx,5,t5_2s254

10773166,0,t1_ddr5h4t,gt Even in  years therell still be Iodine presentFukushima was  years ago.  lets call that  days.    .  .            xStatistically there is no more iodine left.  mole is  atoms.  You might find one. Or the last one might have gone away two years ago.  Dont be pedantic. It is effectively gone and its statistically likely it is entirely gone. Every atom of it. For Years.gtThe linearnothreshold model endorsed by many nuclear agencies is pretty clear on this the more radiation the higher the cancer risk.It is not endorsed.  It is used as a basis for policy. They are not the same thing.  There is no good epidemiological studies that support the LNT Hypothesis.  By contrast while I wont go as far to assert hormesis there is some data that actually supports that.Listening to the LNT Hypothesis is what gets you to kill  people here and now evacuating Fukushima rather than  statistical deaths from cancer over  years.  Overcautious policy of radioactive harm fetishizes the avoidance of death by radioactivity and can and in this case did lead to more people dying by other means.gtYou can decontaminate a road but it gets difficult decontaminating nature. And there are going to be hotspots local spots for example where rainwater accumulates where radiation is several times the background levels because fission products accumulated there. Theres no way to find these hotspots but they are there and they are a menace to your health.If they exist and they do they are quite easy to find.  If they are radioactive at any level approaching harm to people they act like giant beacons to any radiationdetecting equipment.  If they arent detectable theyre no where close to approaching hazardous.gtYour plenty safe is a purely rhetorical phrase which has no meaning whatsoever for the actual hazards in the exclusion zone.Well below levels if lived in constantly would result in receiving an annual dosage less than received by other population groups which have been studied to have no negative effect  Thatd be workers following annual limits set by policy under the LNT hypothesis.And the further out areas have lower levels of radiation elevated as they are than many wellpopulated zones around the world with higher levels of background radiation.  Zones which incidentally have not shown any statistical increase in cancer as a result of that radiation.So by plenty safe it is a direct comparison to equal or below levels which have been shown plenty safe around the globe at many population centers or with many population groups.gtIf it means that statistically out of  residents only  will conceive a radiationinduced cancer then this doesnt mean that the other  live happily on. It means that  residents lived in fear of getting sick and  got actually unlucky. If it means that  of your garden is reasonably safe for your child to play in then this doesnt mean that you shrug of the  danger of your child stumbling over the hotspot the decontamination missed. It means that you lock your kid inside and dont let it play outside.It doesnt mean anything as significant as those and it doesnt mean the latter public hysteria unless someone like you comes and misleads them.,NuclearPower,ddr69it,6,t5_2s254
