6908316,0,t3_4abxbo,Its understandable that customers feel theyre getting less value for money but Im sure Netflix feels differently.  It costs them a lot of money and effort to open up legal streaming service to a new country. Most of the other streaming services arent even trying because its so daunting. Its not their fault that the catalog of titles they are allowed to stream is restricted by licensing agreements. They still have to incur a lot of startup costs and charge a fee based on those costs rather than on the amount of content. They will do their best to increase the amount of content as rapidly as possible as they have in other countries  and it will get more priority if there are more customers in your country.  Thats what Netflix would say and theres some validity to it. However we all know that Netflix is charging a fee based more on a global standard than on the local market and they could charge less initially based on having less content if they chose. They dont want to do that because it would make it more difficult to increase prices later.,NetflixByProxy,d0zdlcj,3,t5_3cz7r

If your nonprepay debit card is USUK thats locked into your account. Its as simple as that. However the enormous spike in piracy thats going to happen and the drop in demand for the us catalogue will see this fixed within a year or so. Heres hoping.,NetflixByProxy,d1r43f1,2,t5_3cz7r

7489994,0,t1_d2t1rki,It has everything to do with it. In fact it even predates these supports and stems from the reel days where it was too expensive to produce reels for all territories so youd start with the US make your money and then gradually extend your reach. The industry would have organized distribution rights differently if there hadnt been an inherent limitation to physically shipping expensive media beyond US borders which is where most of the production was made. Had the industry started with digital media where the marginal cost of catering to distant regions is negligible this would not have happened.The system perpetuates itself because it is now engrained in the economics of content production. For a movie the producer may typically seek early distribution agreements in several distinct territories to help fund the production well ahead of the release. And if a producer chose to skip the local distributors he or she just wouldnt renounce this funding the distributors who are theater chain owners and TV conglomerates could pretty much prevent the movie from being shown locally theaters and television limiting its release to a much narrower online market.The there are issues of dubbing and promotional marketing of the movie in different languages where the local distributor again plays a role but if this was the true justification of keeping the exclusive regional distribution system in place there wouldnt be convoluted mechanisms preventing lets say a German audience from watching an American feature in its original form online which is what Netflix has been doing by banning proxies and VPNs. Case in point the same system exists for music too where different catalogs are available by country and distributor even though music doesnt need any dubbing or translation  it is strictly consumed in its original formatlanguage.This is largely a matter of an industry not adapting fast enough to the disruptions brought about by inexpensive and instantaneous digital transferability of content. Barriers to entry were raised along border lines and then perpetuated themselves into the digital age.,NetflixByProxy,d2tklj7,6,t5_3cz7r

Then if you cant find the page of  their website check your windows firewall open up the port for ports for VPN like LPP PPTP etc. Or just turn off windows firewall altogether which is easier. Make sure your VPN server computer is in the DMZ of your router. Worst case scenario Google how to share your vpn connection over wifi then follow the instructions to use Windows ICS using WAN mini port over your wifi card.
