6684302,0,t3_4779v8,A note this card is currently bugged online an opponent can still use viscera seer to sac creatures while the angel is in play.  So maybe dont try it out online right now.,DeathAndTaxesMTG,d0aprjd,3,t5_3bzyg
7348055,0,t1_d2df727,its pretty diverse i would say with a bit of a skew towards the aggro side of things in the form of fast zoo burn affinity merfolk...I was just kind of popping off decks that are in recent memory of me playing the past month or two.,DeathAndTaxesMTG,d2df96p,1,t5_3bzyg

8537787,0,t3_4vdvaq,I like vial wisp tricks but my top plays are the mindtrick ones  Land drop a cavern and name elemental to fake a wisp in hand. Opponents usually adjust and misplay. Especially if Stoneforge Mystic shenannigans happened earlier.  Hardcast a wisp into my empty board and flicker my own white source to fake StP in hand. I pulled it off against infect recently and I could see that he had the kill in hand but opted to play around a sword instead. I didnt have it. I won the game couple turns later.  Flickering my own resolved needle against lands. Surprise call on port or maze to untap and alphastrike or cataclysmgideon is best. ,DeathAndTaxesMTG,d68sght,2,t5_3bzyg
9265598,0,t1_d8qggbc,Thanks for the info! On the same topic why so many people play Mangara of Corondor? It seems to me so much weaker than the other options aside from the ability to bring it back with wispangeldisplacer which the Fiend Hunter also fullfils...,DeathAndTaxesMTG,d8qhb1v,1,t5_3bzyg
9559509,0,t3_5bpdkt,Some times it feels like Scapeshift is a free win game one. The same goes for certain variants of the Tool Box decks the ChordEvolution decks have a really tough time with our decks. As it has been said we dont really have any Freebies. Our decks reward tight concise plays. as the Saying goes Play perfect get rewarded.,DeathAndTaxesMTG,d9rem6z,1,t5_3bzyg

10031404,0,t3_5jcofs,Whats the spirit for? Id cut  mom for new thalia helps vs shardless and eldrazi a lot. Jailer is great for miracles. For anything else its pretty meh. Thing is you wont dive for hims with recruiter because prelate is better  times.I dont see answers to new omni.  canonists and  containment is not enough. Try something like seal of cleansing. Aluren is out too and canonist is a beast there. Also what is sword of war and peace for? UR delver and TNN are around and it doesnt help there. ,DeathAndTaxesMTG,dbf4aff,1,t5_3bzyg
11218858,0,t1_df3mnu7,I mean it works for me maybe you should give it a try. I think it makes the deck more smooth and lets you play more cards that dont just have okay ability in this current meta. Although yes i agree in a normal meta yeah flicker wisp is good at his job and it really gokd in the deck but displacer can come out on turn   it can flicker alot more things and it does not get blocked and killed by lingering souls tokens out of the jund death shadow decks and the growing rise of abzan to combat death shadow decks. We can agree to disagree but saying i am wrong is not a fair statment. ,DeathAndTaxesMTG,df3n6ik,3,t5_3bzyg
