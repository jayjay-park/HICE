2614121,0,t1_cmzsod4,Im guessing therell be a market to trade them for bitcoin probably making their value rise since plenty of redditors love reddit unconditionally... and you could probably use them directly buy reddit things on redditgifts or redditmarket.Itd get interesting if they take this route...,redditnotes,cmzsxqg,8,t5_2trj3

2614811,0,t3_2pqp7f,I would like to use them for helping other redditors along with individuals that have helped change my world views. So many people have contributed so much its impossible to put a monetary value on it. Im excited by notes on a new way to give back and vote with my wallet. ,redditnotes,cmzw6tg,3,t5_2trj3
2616410,0,t1_cn01yya,gthave them as an investment in reddit...a part of reddit im refraining from using the word share here but rather an investment... the amount raised  is now a part of reddit and reddit is giving it back to the community or in particular those active members that make reddit what it isExactly how? All you got right now is saying that these digital currency is part of Reddit but how? Just by saying it is? This promissory note has to be based on an actual promise that it is capable of being exchanged into actual money FROM Reddit to be able to work. Calling it worth a dollar doesnt magically make it worth a dollar if your promise doesnt exist to begin with. If I do have Reddit notes what can I really exchange it into from Reddit? Im not saying from the community but from Reddit HQ directly. Back then you can use your bank notes and exchange for real gold if you want to but for obvious reasons theyve convinced people that promise is not necessary any more and thats how we got our fiat now. But at least they had a real promise back then what is the real promise from Reddit now?gt they can take it in one direction where they would be traded as bitcoins and start looking for vendors to look at it as legitimate currency for trading.How do we not know this isnt just some scheme for Reddit to make even more money for themselves? They created a digital currency out of almost nothing. Then people are saying they are worth a dollar. Now suddenly Reddit can make a bunch of money by trading them to those who want it and believe its valuable. How is this not a premined centralized currency scheme just like other altcoin except its done by a company?Dont compare this with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not premined nor is it centralized. What Reddit is planning to make is completely opposite to what Bitcoin stands for. Theyre basically trying to make a digital fiat where they themselves are the bank.,redditnotes,cn03q4j,1,t5_2trj3
2621014,0,t1_cn0h4z3,Pretty much any subreddit focused on a single game. One guy will grab the subreddit when the game is new and control it with a few friends to be how they want it.,redditnotes,cn0pddf,1,t5_2trj3
