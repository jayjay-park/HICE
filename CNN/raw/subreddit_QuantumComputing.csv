2595624,0,t1_cmx9111,There are encryption techniques which are quite literally unhackable. Look into one time pads. From the way this system works its saying the card itself isnt vulnerable. No one could make an absolutely identical card because to do so you would need infinite machine precision which would be violating mathematical and physical laws.,QuantumComputing,cmxdvjq,5,t5_2r7m8

10923076,0,t3_5w10hx,When you decrypt a hash function you dont get the original input. You get a very tiny gibberish input that has the same hash output.Whether or not well ever be able to quickly find SHA preimages depends entirely on whether or not anyone ever finds serious cryptographic weaknesses in the function. Quantum computing isnt a magic bullet here. The obvious algorithm still requires  work which is a lot better than classicals  but still completely intractable.,QuantumComputing,de6n0u7,3,t5_2r7m8
11079680,0,t3_5y67ir,So could quantum computers ever be a component in a regular computer the way a GPU is?  The machine can recognize the problem type and offload it to the QPU and then wait for the response?  ,QuantumComputing,denve4b,3,t5_2r7m8
