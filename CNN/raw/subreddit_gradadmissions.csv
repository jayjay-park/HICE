160472,0,t3_1vxevj,Having gone to a school in the bible belt Id say this is more a factor in rural civilian life. A higher university separates them selves from this by not affiliating with a particular religion unless of course you attend a religious school and students werent there to impose their religious views in my experience. As a matter of fact many schools in this region are making an effort to diversify their student population by bringing in international students  offering very nice financial packages to lure the best international candidates. I know the school I attended we welcomed international students different perspectives in class room discussions. ,gradadmissions,cewpln6,5,t5_2tn62

862991,0,t3_23ytuf,Any serious applicant for psychology should have a high GPA and GRE scores strong letters of recommendations and a good amount of research experience. However your competitiveness really depends on what subdiscipline and type of degree Masters vs PhD vs PsyD youre interested in. Masters programs tend to have more relaxed standards than doctoral programs in that minimum GPAGRE requirements are lower and many programs are willing to accept students that dont have research experience.On the other hand doctoral programs are very competitive and hard to get into. Just having a high GPAGRE isnt good enough you also need at least several semesters of research experience. PhD programs with guaranteed funding are especially strict because they want to make sure that students have the necessary research experience before committing thousands of dollars. Out of all the doctoral programs clinical psychology is by far the most competitive. Its not unusual for a PhD program to receive  applications for a class of only  which makes it on par with med school in terms of difficulty. If youre interested in going to a clinical psychology PhD program straight out of college youre going to need near perfect grades a really high GRE and extensive research experience. Publications and extracurricular activities are pretty much a must as well to distinguish yourself from the hundreds of other applicants. Finally you must demonstrate that your researchtheoretical interests match up with the faculty someone who is interested in depression will not get into a program thats focused on schizophrenia.Tldr A competitive psychology student will have a high at least . GPA high GRE scores at least  for verbal AND math strong letters of rec a strong personal statement that clearly defines your goals and finally extensive research experience.

I had a lot of field research experience coming out of undergrad and Im pretty comfortable talking in interviews which I think helped. I only applied to schools where MS is the terminal degree so I didnt have to worry about competing against PhD students for places or attention. The MOST important thing for me was getting interviews and actually going to the school and talking with potential advisors. Having that nameface recognition was by far the thing that set apart my subpar application. In my experience just emailing people isnt enough. If you are applying to out of state schools then set up a Skype interview or at the very least a phone interview.I am going off of what the applications are saying with the requesting undergraduate GPAs first and I know a couple top schools in my field specifically say that they dont consider postgrad GPAs. I did have a potential advisor respond recently and say that at least for her school the terminology is confusing but undergrad GPA requirement is more of a guideline and that my MS GPA should help with the admission committee.Hope that helped.,gradadmissions,ck96ltv,1,t5_2tn62

That can be both helpful and nerve inducing.Will you have any publications by the time you graduate?  I had a pretty meh GPA above . but nothing to write home about but my research experience and the way I spun my application in my statement of purpose and letters of rec made up for it and I got into my first choice with full funding.  Grad schools want to see that you will be an effective researcher above all else. If you can prove that and your letter writers back it up youll be in good shape.  Getting in touch with professors at schools youd like to attend is always a good idea.  Make sure youre sending emails that show your interest in them specifically though.  They get tons of generic emails like hey i like science can you tell me about your science? k thanks and you want yours to stick out by being thoughtful.So anyway my advice apply to a few top picks you really like and do as much as you can to stand out from the crowd by emailing professors making your application tell a story or...something.  Youre not a shooin for top picks but if you play your cards right you might have a good chance.  In addition definitely choose a few schools ranked  or higher that you like as well.

I applied to two programs at one school because I was interested in the research being done by faculty in the programs and felt that I could use the programs for my research in different but still satisfying ways. Make your statement of purpose relevant to the programs the faculty and the research being done and it might be okay to apply to multiple programs in one school. Not more than two though for sure and dont try if there is a rule on the DGS website.Its definitely true that if faculty want you they can pull strings.

Do grad schools look down upon taking it multiple times?This depends entirely on you as an individual your study habits your test taking ability your knowledge base. Often the best practice is start early and study often but theres really no simple answer to when you should start as everyone is different.Generally graduate programs wont hold it against you if you take the GRE more than once.gtDo I need to take any GRE subject tests?This depends on the specific requirements of each program. You should visit their admissions pages to find out. gtIs there anything else really important that I need to know about applying to grad school?GPA GRE and other quantifiables are important for getting you in the door but strong personal statements research interests and recommendations are often what makes or break an application.

7972642,0,t1_d490dfw,Congratulations on such a strong resume! It sounds like youll have no trouble getting into a good program. Heres my two cents about doing your MPH right after graduation thoughI had initially planned on doing a  program in public health and wouldve gotten my masters in  after graduating in . I got some advice to take a few years to work before applying though and I wound up being really glad that I did that  I am now halfway through my program and will be graduating in . These may or may not apply to you but here are the reasons that I was really glad that I didnt go straight to grad school    . I would have been in the wrong program. I thought I knew what I wanted to do in public health but after actually doing it I realized that I was meant to be doing something different. I completed an amazing health policyadvocacy fellowship in DC but by the end of it I knew federal health policy was not for me. That fellowship did lead me to a job that led me to community organizing though and now I am in the perfect program. Will I change my mind again later? Maybe. But I am so much closer to the path I was meant to take. You say youre interested in health policy or global health and these may or may not intersect depending on your class and internship choices. Some work experience may help you focus on one of these if you are unsure.. I was more competitive in the application process. Public health is an extremely practical field and it values practical experience quite a bit. If you plan to exclusively do public health research then this is less important but real world experience is especially useful in policy and community health type programs which seems to be what youre interested in. This is heavily related to number .. It was easier to get scholarships assistantships and internships. I had offers of partial funding from several top  public health schools when I applied after a few years of work and Id say my undergrad resume was slightly less impressive than yours. I also got a research assistantship that is covering most of the rest of my tuition and I was more competitive for internships due to the practical skills I picked up between degrees you will be competing with your peers for many of the same positions in the citystate you choose to go to. All of this but especially the professional opportunities are directly related to the fact that I had tangible and specific professional experiences before applying.. I am getting more out of my classes. This seems a bit counterintuitive but having professional experiences to draw on has made it easier to grasp theories and skills and I have had more to say in class discussions than my peers that came straight from undergrad.Of course all of this is specific to me and may or may not apply to you. I just wanted to share my experience of why Im really glad that I waited a few years to get my MPH. You may not be able to get your dream job without an MPH but what you do wind up doing will make you more competitive and prepared. Look into AmeriCorps seasonal fellowships and other temporary positions if you are worried about getting stuck in a position.Sorry about the wall of text I hope I didnt come off as preachy. I guess this is all fresh in my mind because I was in your position just a few years ago.  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about grad school applying or entering the public health field!,gradadmissions,d4c77xr,1,t5_2tn62

9870979,0,t1_daspyx3,I have the same question as OP . for my bachelors if you round to the nearest tenth sigh . for my masters no rounding required. Howwhere would you talk about your growth? For me growth just meant I was a stupid fuck as an undergrad who couldnt manage his time and let emotional issues get in the way of academic pursuits and now I can manage my time marginally better and I have an easier time compartmentalizing but its mostly since I no longer have a social life and its been forever since Ive dated and went through any kind of heartbreak.

10283176,0,t3_5n90ie,It depends on your field but it seems to be becoming more common lately. Concerns about your ability to network through affiliations with other institutions or being exposed to particular methods are being assuaged by the ease of global communication. There are still holdouts and there are still legitimate reasons including networking and exposure to different methods and ideas for changing programs. If your current institution sets you up for the most success there is not reason not to go in my opinion.However you shouldnt go because you feel inadequate about your GPA or anything like that. If youve identified  faculty members who research that species that youd like to work with you should apply to all  and figure it out when the time comes. As for potential employers it may or may not have an impact. No one can say for sure right now. However the most important things for getting a job at least in my field and Im sure its the same or similar for others are publications in high impact journals and external funding. Again if your current program puts you in the best position for these then Id say go for it unless this is still really frowned upon in your field.,gradadmissions,dc9nklv,8,t5_2tn62
10297022,0,t3_5ndpj0,Im surprised theres someone with a similar situation on here! My boyfriend and I just started grad school at the same university. Obviously this wont work for everyone but heres my experienceWe were both graduating at the same time and we both wanted to go into PhD programs. We were looking in major cities mostly sometimes with two schools near each other. We ended up in a Masters  PhD program were in Canada and theyre more common here with funding.First we made a list of schools separately as you are doing and we narrowed it down based on our separate interests. We ended up with three exactly overlapping schools and one more in the same city New York. We applied to eight each. It was even harder for us because we only applied to super highly ranked places because those were the only places worth moving to anotjer country for to us and they were highly ranked for both our areas.So youve heard the good news which is that we eventually got in to the same place. What you dont yet know is most of the bad news we didnt get into most of the places we applied. I got into  and none of them overlapped with my boyfriend. He didnt get into any of the seven so he was starting to get worried. I went to the interview day for one of my acceptances and I was starting to favour it over the other one. I told my boyfriend to give this place that he didnt apply to another chance so he looked it up and found someone doing exactly what he wanted. He was very focused on applying to the US the first time that he ignored this place its near where we were in Canada. There was a rolling admissions program in his field so he applied to that by this time it was FebMarch and got in.There are some key differences here to note his was a masters program which is easier than PhD programs to get into. His program had rolling admissions so he could apply later on which isnt possible for a PhD. The school is good for both of us but not super amazing. Theres very few decent schools in Canada and in terms of world rankings its not very good. Also because that was his only option my boyfriend didnt have much of a chance to pick something with good funding so his funding package is not very good. He has a similar amount of loans as you both but we are younger and this doesnt worry him as much though it is a concern.This one is probably a big part of why this worked we came from the best school in our country and this school is a bit lower than the one we came from. Its still good but the current one has a bit of an inferiority complex. We had worked with really good people at the first school and had quite competitive stats to be honest more me than him. I personally was very competitive for this school and for both of us it was a lot lower ranked than the other places we were applying some of our schools included NYU MIT Columbia UCLA UC Berkeley and UCSD. I wasnt  sure but I received an award for being the best applicant and I won a competitive scholarship almost no first years receove. Anyone can find the tier of schools that they have more of a chance at and where their qualities will be well received.If you absolutely KILL the GRE you get really amazing letters from people who have known you for as long as possible and can really speak to your potential as researchers if you do as well as possible in classes and get yourself on posters publications if possible reach out to potential PIs go to conferences write and rewrite and improve your SOP and just generally go beyond whatever anyone says about teaching the minimum you need to be a good applicant. You want to have your chances unlike us and then you can pick from what you have based on what is best for both of you.As older people you will be seen as more mature and dependable but some people may think you arent into putting in long hours and working super hard. I dont think you owe anyone that and they shouldnt judge you based on those things but unfortunately sometimes it still does happen. I wouldnt mention your status mostly because you dont need to I specifically didnt think it was relevant that my boyfriend was applying at the same time.Regarding your question  your earning potential is much higher with a graduate degree. Compound interest is great but living frugally even a bit better than you had been through undergrad and you will through grad will still allow you to save a lot on a postPhD salary as long as you arent a postdoc. So you can make up for lost time quickly and easily by living below your means.A gap year can help if you are working but its definitely difficult to find a job that is only for a short period of time. Either way you want to save up as much as you can and get onto as many papersposters as you can to show that you are keeping your research going through that time. Does your university hire RAs and pay them? Or maybe you could be a technician of some sort that helps run studies?I wouldnt apply to more than  schools per person. Above a certain amount you wont be able to tailor each application well because you will have too many to apply to. The only exception to this is for clinical psychology programs. Im in a different part of psych but clinical psychology has a lower acceptance rate than medical school. Only about  of people get into any university. Is this the type of psychology that your wife wants for sure? Because it requires a lot more steps for the application to be competitive and she will likely have to apply more than once. There are other kinds of PhDs that are not as impossible and they might be worth a look. You can see a lot of stats for different schools on their websites. If shes not planning on applying to academia then she doesnt have to worry about changing schools. Many people want to go somewhere else to gain a different experience but its not always necessary. Its just not guaranteed that you will get into the place you are from. My boyfriend applied but he didnt get into the same school we came from.Overall dont do what I did it was a big chance to take try to be as good as you can so that they want you and then you can both have options and be as flexible as possible.Also some major cities with multiple good research universities are New York Boston Chicago and San Francisco. There might be more I dont know. But they are of course highly ranked and its hard to get into those but its a start to look into them.,gradadmissions,dcb81pj,6,t5_2tn62

11111429,0,t3_5yezxu,I wouldnt say zero. But you need to approach it differently. MENSA isnt going to help you just having a high IQ test score doesnt prove you can do academics and makes you sound extremely arrogant and entitled. If you were so smart how come are your grades so poor and GRE scores so average? See how a college admin could think. You should consider on how to mention that fact in an application since it can hurt you more than help you.  Same thing goes for  letters of recommendations. Holy hell thats a lot. I just got into two Dutch universities and have applied to other German ones. You only need three recommendations at most and they better be good and personal ones  the number is completely irrelevant. Coming from Zimbabwe or Pakistan two schools are called NUST apparently you will have an even harder time because of where you come from sorry and the fact that NUST is not as known as other universities . Though you might want to look at what scholarships or awards you are eligible for since you might certainly meet some criteria and some schools really value diversity. I dont think your choice of school is too out there I dont think it could be achievable unless you have glowing recommendations from respectable sources and a perfect letter of motivation that outlines also why you didnt necessarily get the best grades maybe you were focusing on something else in your free time. I would get that GPA up if possible and Study up for a GRE retake if you are half as smart as you say you are and are invested to go to Grad school spend some time studying and improve your scores. You definitely need to get better than average to be meet even basic requirements from some of these programs. ,gradadmissions,dergyvd,1,t5_2tn62
11120998,0,t1_desdazy,Oh yeah I should probably have been clearer that I wouldnt be putting the part about job loss in the letter it would definitely be more lowkey on the level of Im surprised that this happened two days after my acceptance of the original offer was confirmed and would like to have my admissions status confirmed before moving forward. I totally get that computer errors occur and I wouldnt think twice about it if it had been quickly fixed  its moreso that Im salty about it in the context of their general mishandling of app materials throughout the process and their poor interpersonal methods for handling said errors. Which other students are experiencing as well.  It made for a suspenseful application cycle! But yeah youre definitely right that the new offer is great and the first priority should probably to just make sure that the new offer is locked down.

Theres a chance they wont find out but if they do they would have very solid ground to remove you from the program or other very serious consequences...dont risk it. You can however submit a supplemental statement along with your application materials explaining this bad grade. Show them that it is clearly the exception to the rule and come up with a good reason  not just that you didnt try a good reason that it happened. At the very least they will see that you can own up to your mistakes. Shit happens everyone on the admissions committee has failures they are not proud of too.
