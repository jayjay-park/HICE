107031,0,t3_1v8rni,Like the others before me I just came to say that Ive taken a pretty significant number of classes by myself and was completely comfortable. I would say that on average the majority of students that show up for group classes alone. Plus its usually a pretty even split between menwomen.,Salsa,ceqm81t,1,t5_2qj5a

3607691,0,t3_31knhj,I grew up playing piano and violin and have felt that Ive generally picked up beat fairly easily.  If youre having trouble staying on beat picking out something to listen for may help but I dont think its an absolute necessity otherwise.  That being said you may find value in learning the instruments rhythms for the sake of learning more about the music even if its not directly for improving your dancing.,Salsa,cq3i42r,1,t5_2qj5a

3848707,0,t1_cqubxqz,Si yo soy El Diablito.  I am not at all judging or condeming you.  We Latins run hot blooded and our dances even more so.I dont disagree that at times there is some sexual tension because hey dancing is intimate sensual and passionate.  I just disagreed that grinding up on someone was a good play to see whats up.  I go out dancing with a group of friends and the women usually figure out who the poppy chulos are who take every chance to see if they have a play.  Some women do go dancing to hook up but I think its best to enjoy the dance for the dance.  You can talk during a dance to see if there is something else.  Shit I met my wife at a party.,Salsa,cquzj9t,4,t5_2qj5a
4105540,0,t3_37fji1,You probably feel you are doing worse because you are dancing with less skilled follows who are also just learning the moves and are not getting the one on one attention that you were in a private lesson. Also you will be rotating through follows so on top of being not as good as your instructor each one has to get used to you as you go through the rotation adding an additional challenge. I personally went group lessons up front and have only taken  private lessons which were just group lessons in which I was the only one to show up because I think group lessons and time on the floor are the best learning tools you can get. Once you get to be a decent dancer take private lessons to clean up your bad habbits and add flair or fancier stuff that cant really be taught in group lessons due to the nature of varying ability and attention that can be paid to each participant. That said I felt pretty shitty as at salsa for several months and then it changed to going from feeling great to shitty the next nightdance. The first  months will often suck.But as someone else said the most important thing is to get out there and dance with people randomly.  Its scary disheartening and challenging but its necessary and is ultimately where you need to go in the end anyway unless your goal is just to dance with your instructor forever.I find that about  out of every  group lessons I go to teaches me a move I really like so I add that one to the mix.  Figure that you need about  basic patterns on top of basic turns etc to get through a dance comfortably. Figuring that dont feel at all bad if you arent really enjoying it as much as working your way though dances for a good  months and even then it will probably only just start to feel better.,Salsa,cro98fg,1,t5_2qj5a

6158059,0,t3_3yn518,Cuban style indeed as many have already pointed out here. Its a lovely style of salsa very much relaxed and in the opinion of some makes better use of the dance floor. I am a LA style fan so I dont agree with that. But as long as you are on the rhythms eitehr on  or  or cuban its ok ,Salsa,cyplvr7,1,t5_2qj5a
6283570,0,t3_41nn4h,Hi there Im new to salsa as well! From what Ive learned in about a month and a half of private salsa lessons practice makes perfect. Im by no means a pro but maybe what I have to say can help you In my little time learning Ive found that practicing turns at different speeds to help improve my turning as well as practicing my hand movements  hand movements while connected to your partner and solo. Also practice with and without music and dont forget to count your steps!Leads give you momentum to perform turns. When its simple turns you dont really get much momentum but you get signals which should be sufficient. For more complex turns that change your positioning or involve more than one spin your lead has to help. From my perspective salsa is about the flow of momentum. If its natural then you feel your movements as fluid and continuous. If there are momentum problems then it feels clunky.,Salsa,cz3vdau,2,t5_2qj5a

6791469,0,t3_48nqo5,Overall it was a good article. The only point I would make is about the older lonely men. The wording of the article almost seemed to imply that while age discrimination was a bad thing for those really really old men discrimination was almost understandable. Because a  year old dude? Dang.ampnbspI know that wasnt the intent bit it stung a little. Im in my late s ... In  years that old dude will be me and I have every intention of still being a dancer. And I will probably still be single. But I dance to this music strictly because I love the music and I love partner dancing.,Salsa,d0m3o7e,2,t5_2qj5a
6810588,0,t3_491540,It could always be that the girls you dance with dont know any salsa at all but Id seriously doubt it. Cross body and rubber bandsopen break? are very fundamental steps and Im pretty much every girl that goes to salsa parties know the step. How about right turn?Id look into what your teacher is doing. Are you the only student having problems with leading? Also are the only follows who can do what you want from your class? The true test to know whether youve mastered a move in salsa is to dance with girls that dont go to your class and havent see the routine you were taught in class. Has the teacher specifically danced with you and told you where the problem is? Have you told him of your problems with fundamental steps and if yes what was his answer? I strongly suspect the problem is that the teacher isnt teacher proper leading.A good teacher would dance with you every now and then in the class to confirm youre leading the move correctly would explain what makes the girl move in every move would drill youor at least tell you to improve your basic steps until theyre acceptable. ,Salsa,d0o9zme,3,t5_2qj5a

7162850,0,t1_d1s9xg2,Agreed.And far as social dances go salsa is one of the least intimate imo. Its too fast to allow for the kind of sensuality that you can find for example in Bachata or Kizomba.Anyway OP dont be that asshole boyfriend that makes a person chose between them and dancing.

11769277,0,t3_67xpxr,The first three on your list are great ideas. Listen to a lot of salsa and practice the basic step. And maybe the basic moves like a crossbody lead. And just focus on being ON time. Thats probably the absolute best thing to work on for improvement in just one week. And I dont believe anyone is a natural. You probably have just seen people who have put in a lot more practice. Oh just one year? What if they practiced  hours EVERY day. Compared to someone dancing  hours every week for  years. Progress comes from practice.,Salsa,dgu2u5a,4,t5_2qj5a
