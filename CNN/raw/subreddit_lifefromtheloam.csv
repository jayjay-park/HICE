7186824,0,t3_4dwjtv,I really really like it. Its like a mini faithless looking too in a creature form which would be great for vengevine triggers.,lifefromtheloam,d1v2w71,3,t5_3dbia
7709451,0,t1_d3ifkp4,Ive played Zombie Loam a lot. Actually I started building dredge a while back when I discovered it then played it as my main deck on cockatrice for a couple of weeks. Its very fun and very explosive. I already liked Life from the Loam from various other decks like Legacy Lands and as Im JohnnySpike this made me wonder what more I could build around it in Modern.Then played some Loam Pox and Haakon Loam. I played Dredgevine for a little while when SOI came out and now want to build something myself.Your list looks very cool. Ive never played Lingering Souls in Zombie Loam seems like a solid addition. I agree with cutting Brownscale MD.,lifefromtheloam,d3iih9k,1,t5_3dbia
