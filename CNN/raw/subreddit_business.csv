27538,0,t1_cehkc0m,You cannot produce spirits for beverage purposes without paying taxes and without prior approval of paperwork to operate a distilled spirits plant. See  U.S.C.  amp  for some of the criminal penalties. There are numerous requirements that must be met that make it impractical to produce spirits for personal or beverage use. Some of these requirements are paying special tax filing an extensive application filing a bond providing adequate equipment to measure spirits providing suitable tanks and pipelines providing a separate building other than a dwelling and maintaining detailed records and filing reports. All of these requirements are listed in  CFR Part . And yes its perfectly safe regardless of competence. Making methanol is actually incredibly involved and you cant just do it accidentally in any sort of amount that would be dangerous,business,cehkfyo,3,t5_2qgzg
28569,0,t1_cehmm21,Thanks a lot for the detailed response. Im assuming that trading in futures and options requires a company to have considerable reserve funds. From what Ive learnt the futures markets arent used to physically exchange commodities. Is this true? As a small company we spend almost all funds purchasing agricultural commodities so that we can keep the production lines running. Im guessing exchanges like the CME are for big market players. Having said that is it worthwhile for me to keep an eye on futures exchanges? Would it at least provide me with information regarding price movements in the physical commodity markets?,business,cehonys,1,t5_2qgzg

52909,1,t3_1upepg,I agree. The person who makes your food plays a large role in the tip you leave yet they never see any of it.Ridiculous. I have never understood why people tip based on cultural expectation and not the service they receive. If anything start at  tip and go up or down from there based on service. Thats it.I posted this a while back it is pertinent hereFor people who havnt been waiters and dont know about this law If a waiter gets paid  an hour base and that waiter doesnt make up the difference in that  and at least minimum wage then the business has to front the rest of the money to bring it up to a minimum wage average over their hours. So if they work  hours and only make  the company is obligated legally to make up the difference in that  and the amount they would have made with minimum wage base pay. Link at bottom of post.Like it or not and I have been a waiter so I know this is true a lot of waiters love to complain about tips even though the problem isnt that serious. Any waiter worth their salt will be able to make at any restaurant that has moderate foot traffic well over minimum wage on average. The ones who dont I have found through personal experience are either lazy dont want to refill drinks leave customers hanging around waiting for checks etc or they just arent good at their job not everyone is cut out for that line of work. Tips and gratuity are supposed to be based on service. They are not supposed to be mandatory. Do people abuse this occasionally? yeah. But the vast majority dont. The vast majority will drop  on that line regardless of the service they got. A lot of waiters abuse that fact and do less work expecting they will get the tip regardless. A lot of times they will get it regardless.I guess the bottom line is waiters and waitresses have nothing to complain about. Everyone has to pay taxes. Thats just how it is. Why should waiters and waitresses be excused from that? If that was the case every service industry should start working on a tip basis just to get out of having to pay taxes.I am fully expecting to be downvoted for this opinion. But not everyone is a starving single mother of two who is putting their way through graduate school while working at dennys. A lot of waiters and waitresses arent bad people they just think they have some inherent right or privilege because they are taking your order. In a perfect world they would have to split their tips with the cooks in a lot of places. Why? because a lot of times people will tip based on the quality of their food as well and that has nothing to do with who sets it down on your table. Or how about when you order a mixed drink from your table? The bartender makes it. He doesnt see much of that tip most places he sees exactly none of it.Sources I have worked in the industry as a waiter cook and bartender.Source for anyone who cares about the law. I would really like to note a lot of people in the US have this insane false perception about how waiters get paid. The fact of the matter is they arent going to starve if they get  tips. In fact they will make out exactly the same as everyone else working entry level jobs. You hear this all the time Tips are how they make their money. We have to tip. Someone usually says this when you get a particularly bad waiterwaitress and would rather not even tip at all. That statement is wrong. They will get paid regardless. And tipping is supposed to be based on service received.Edit To stem any confusion part of this was in regard to a question of whether gratuity was taxed or not.,business,cekgck9,-1,t5_2qgzg

I mean you can define aggressiveness and use John D Rockefeller or Jack Welch as examples. Talk about taking any steps necessary within the confines of the law to gain an advantage. You could talk about how good leaders develop talent by empowering measuring performance and coaching.I dont know...I guess this is my final thought on the matter. Real competence is at a premium in business circles. Really aggressive business people are hard to find and aggressiveness is hard to teach.

Corporations constantly take advantage of their customers by forcing them to sign up somewhere with an email address which the naive customer blindly gives because they trust the place they shop at which in return the corporation just dishes out the information to whoever pays them. Every morning millions of people wake up and instead of getting straight to work it takes them   sometimes  minutes of deleting unwanted junk mail. Do the math and you can easily rack up thousands of hours of stolen time all because corporations want to make a few extra bucks off of you.Imagine if you had a friend who every time heshe invited you out somewhere heshe also brought a long a couple friends who were involved with a MLM.

181314,0,t1_ceysva0,I was following you up to the point that you said Uber is a parasite. Uber was the first cab company to have a decent online presence  decent app and came up through the grassroots elite cab ride manner where you call a cab and pay automatically so it looks more like a limo ride  personal driver than a cab with a fancy sporty carsuv picking you up.So basically what youre saying makes pretty much zero sense. False calls to their competitors drivers? What competitors?All of the other established cab companies are scrambling to compete. Theyre not anticompetitive theyre just blowing away the competition which are used to being in power due to kickbacks to politicians to keep their immigrant networks alive and well.Uber faced a lot of pressure in chicago over their service exactly because of this its big business to offer immigrants a job waiting for them driving a cab leading to visas and etc. Any other cab company could easily copy the model. Problem is greed. The cab companies love their lease our badge system and dont want to shell out for insurance nice cars trustworthy drivers etc. Also not all cab companies work the way you describe. The badge system is from CITY to COMPANY. Once the company has the badge they can rent it or not. You could be your own gypsy cab etc. You could have employees or you could not.Of course its far more lucrative if you dont because then you dont worry about benefits so much. ,business,cez36q0,8,t5_2qgzg

277441,0,t1_cf9gqop,gt Lets not forget the economies of scale. Even when GM is losing money in one continent it is gaining economies of scale with each car that is sold. Basically the more automobiles sold the less the overall platform costs GM over the life of the car. This is a common error in many peoples thinking. That the economies of scale continue to improve no matter how large an entity gets.Alas it really doesnt work out that way. Yes one can claim that the initial design amp engineering costs continue to be spread and reduced... but really once a certain level of production is reached they are already reduced to such a trivial amount that even a further doubling of total production would not really amount to anything that mattered.And things like tooling have wear amp tear and begin to degrade once a certain number of units have been produced say a million fenders stamped the tolerances become unacceptable and newreplacement tooling needs to be created... so the costs increase again and if graphed things take on a sawtooth pattern.Then there is simply the sizescale of an entity. The larger an organization gets the more the hierarchy increases above it.  In crude poorly organized operations it begins to resemble a pyramid where with each increase to the base the proportion of nonproductive personnelsystems is actually higher than previously  better organization divisions subdivisions etc can reduce the impact of that pyramids withinunderneath pyramids ala serpinski but even that has limits especially as the separate divisions are not necessarily aware of what its siblings are all up to and even communicationplanning becomes a problem.Then there is the impact of a very VERY large entity in terms of resources  in some cases it becomes its own enemy and begins competing against itself in a number of ways and to its own detriment as a crude example consider an auction where two employees of the same firm are both intent and highly motivated to be the buyers of a specific items  perhaps unwittingly or perhaps aware but driven by disparate incentives  they end up bidding against each other and driving the price up inordinately plus there is the effects on the market of the proverbial whale in the pond etc.In short economies of scale has limits  often the phenomenon is described as diseconomies of scale,business,cf9ipk8,15,t5_2qgzg

Out of college employers are not hiring you to be in much of a management position. Typically theyre hiring analysts and people who have technical skills.

The upside is reduced risk of people being trapped by debt because it provides safe guards against getting into debt at all. The downside is it borders on the lender prescribing what you can study.

In other words his  million yearly pay is a symptom not a cause of a broken economy.  The problem then here is the economy with such a concentration of wealth that anybody would make this much.

VC funds are high risk but then again I expect that any institutional investor know this before they invest in a fund that invests in lots of startups.gt The second issue with the venturebacked service economy is the Amazon problem  specifically the practice of selling goods at or near a loss creates a deeply unfair competitive terrain for regular businesses.Startups usually dont use the VC funds to subsidize the product or service itself just the fixed costs. The idea is that when the business scales the fixed costs will be covered.It is sad that mom and pop stores will go bankrupt because of the disruptive innovators but this is the creative destruction that capitalism is dependent on.gt The third problem is that as companies like Kozmo and Webvan learned in the first dotcom crash the music stops eventually.Well obviously the VCs doing the investing here disagree and they have bet large sums of others and their own money that they are right. Some will go under but that is again the kind of creative destruction that is a consequence of innovation.,business,cgri4fk,1,t5_2qgzg

I am assuming that someone took your old job.  A promotion without a backfill isnt really a promotion moving up its just more money to do more work.  If thats the case then the first commentor is correct its a compensation thing.  You didnt really get a promotion you got additional duties for more money.  You still have your old job.  It sounds like you now have a compensation problem because the work is more than you expected.  Since you mention about not getting taken advantage of youll need to go back and figure out how the new duties were described to you and what was offered.  What was discussed about your old duties and see if that happened.  If everything is exactly as described for the new and old duties then you need to look at the other end of the equation and decide if the compensation is really good enough.  Now if you got a promotion and have new duties and you old job was backfilled you have a transition and management problem.  The transition was never successfully completed to move your old duties onto the new person doing the work.  This can be as much of a self management problem if people are coming to you and you are doing the work instead of telling them to go to the new person.  It can be a management issue for whomever managemes you now and who managed your old slot if they arent keeping tabs on the workload and duties of the newly hired person.  Both items are something that should be brought up and discussed.  The audience just depends on where the problem lies.,business,ciktccn,1,t5_2qgzg

1446825,0,t3_2aoayp,Maybe there is an opportunity to try and blend the use of the cell phone into a component of the user experience as opposed to forcing a behavioral change that your customers clearly prefer to exhibit.  Im not entirely sure what this could look like but I believe there are opportunities for it and potential benefits to utilize it.Also think about the reasonsactivities people use their cell phone and specifically at a restaurant Communicate with others theyre meeting at the restaurant This could be the reason for increasing of table movement to  out of  Communicate with others they may interact with that night General communication with others text phone email Information about the restaurant Yelp reviews recommendations location info  Remember we use to rely on you for this information either through phone calls discussion with the waiter or from other guests.  Now we lookup the address to give to our friends determine what to order based on our taste and decide how to best experience your restaurant from our phones. If challenges are had to do these then maybe this time is spent back to the waiters for assistance  out of . General information consumption News Sports etc.  Remember this is a different generation but I feel that it has been acceptable to have a newspaper book or magazine while dining alone or awaiting a guest.  We have moved most of the content to the phone. Social media interaction Facebook Twitter Instagram  Many restaurants actually encourage this behavior in some facet such as a Facebook only special checkin and receive x off post a picture with  and get entered to win a free dinner.  Im not necessarily condoning it or claiming it as the marketing answer but these type of things could replace some of the time your restaurant spends marketing.  Specifically it could be those word of mouth conversations that you encourage taking place to improve business.  The difference is those word of mouth conversations are taking place live at your restaurant now with people who arent there as opposed to when the customer leaves.  That extra time required for  minutes with  out of  are those people telling people about their experience and possibly more efficiently than before A  minute checkin or image post might gain anywhere from  to  impressions based on followers. Being always connected allows people to be more flexible with their time For example the babysitter can contact you so you arent pressured to leave as quickly.  Has your restaurant built an activity to take advantage of the additional time?  Increased dining time should result in increased ticket spend.  Part of the increased dining time would be due to the entertainment provided by the cell phone as opposed to relying solely on the company or the restaurant.  With this additional time are you able to serve more cocktails post meal digestive drinks wines or desserts?  The restaurant may have the opportunity to increase total  per hour of dining time at a more profitable rate such as cocktails.I think there are definitely elements of consideration here and the restaurant could to things to encourage that in a noninvasive or rude manner.  Really though I see this as an opportunity to strategically take advantage of your willingness to spend time at their establishment.  A company that uses this strategy effectively is Starbucks and restaurants could take a greater advantage by serving multiple drinks in a single visit.I think the restaurant owner should take a strategic view of his new found information and maximize it.  Encourage the instagram post after you receive the order.  Recommend something that is photo worthy and a value for checkingin to show the restaurants location to others.  Create a post dinner menu drinks light snacks etc. that allows people to hangout and continue generating revenue.,business,cixmwaa,2,t5_2qgzg

The one thing I cant decide is if Id prefer an android or even linux version needs maturity but one reason to go android is that its easier to escape when mature with the same chip.While the baytrail specs are awesome for me and there are pc apps that I would use and from the few benchmarks I could find windows performance is better than android for this chip though you can consider them even its still not obvious to choose win over android even when the price is the same.  I guess I would lean towards win I need a super calculator with J but the media performance of other chips is going to push others towards android solutions.The point is that windows  is now super interesting at the same price point as android and it should grow as a result.

They still make processors being a leading supplier of ARMbased microcontrollers a platform that is shaping up to compete with Intels processor platforms.

Thats not to mention the kidnappings in Nigeria or the Ebola crisis sweeping across Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea.All these events represent potential operational risk issues and in particular business continuity challenges. While banks need to be monitoring how they manage the latter with regard to geopolitical threats they also need to look further afield.The everincreasing reliance on thirdparty suppliers means banks need to dust off and start scrutinising their contracts with them to see where these companies might be located the jurisdictions they operate in and exactly which geopolitical risks they may find themselves exposed to as a result of these relationships.,business,ck8o4jn,1,t5_2qgzg

Chattanooga is doing coercive services in a way people appreciate but when they fuck up there will be no one to appeal to and no other options. This is a fundamental split in economics and politics. Do we need more government or less? Government granted monopolies got us here do we think that a service run by government that were required to pay for is going to adapt faster than an open market of competing ISPs? We need to fix the market in its locked and broken state but our system works by adding laws and more laws and never removing them.

The problems come from being undemocratic and having conflicts of interest that work against societys interests overall. Im quite happy with Wikipedias monopoly since it is an organization that is relatively democratic and serves the public interest. Way better for Wikipedia to have a monopoly than to have a more competitive world filled with less democratic more biased resources.

Installing and updating antivirus is the bare minimum that should have been done but was not done. No single product or product feature for that matter can be the linchpin of your corporate security posture.

Theyre OK but NFC is far more convenient and with Apple Pays use of a fingerprint scanner more secure than the swipeandsign system prevalent in the United States. With Apple Pay or NFC you just tap and go.In Hong Kong they have an NFCenabled card called an Octopus card you use for the subway buses vending machines convenience stores and even some restaurants. Its fantastically efficient because you dont even need to break stride to take your card out when you pass through the subway gates. You can just tap your wallet or purse against the scanner as you go.

The article even mentions that most Uber drivers are only part time making it more likely that they owned and operated a vehicle prior to being an uber driver.  Im sure there are areas where there are higher concentrations of full time drivers but I have never been in one of those areas personally.  I have used Uber in Seattle Boston and NYC and have never been in a silver prius or even a new car.

I believe it would disincentivize work in multiple ways the first one being that if its big enough to be useful its big enough to stop a large portion of people from working and the second one being if its big enough to be useful its expensive enough that the added tax burden would disincentivize another large portion of people from working. And the fewer people who work the higher taxes have to be to pay for UBI which creates a larger disincentive to work because of the high tax rate which lowers employment which creates a larger burden on the people who are still working... and on and on the spiral goes. gthow is it worse than what we have now?Because it makes the people wholly and utterly dependent on the government.When people are out earning their own money if the government gets too bad they get rid of the government. When people are dependent on the government for their income if the government gets too bad the people will shrug and say sure its awful but Ive got to eat. UBI is an insidious plan by the government to keep people from protesting or revolting no matter how oppressive the government gets. Its some Darth Sidious  Emperor Palpatine level evil shit.

Fewer cabs  existing cabs are busy more of the time  drivers amp owners make more money. The theory was to set an optimal number of taxis by region and then slowly increase it as the population grows. Theres tension between the general public wants cheap amp super easy cabs and the ownerdrivers want no new cabs so theyre always busy.Generally the political will of the driversowners was greater than the general public so there are too few cabs. ,business,cp6i799,2,t5_2qgzg

Another local business owner told me he had already upgraded because You have to!  They said by the end of this year I wouldnt be able to accept anybodys credit cards anymore if I didnt!

Hey anything that makes the line at WalMart move faster right?  But to be honest the sales tactics used by the companies weve talked to put me off of the whole idea from the very beginning before I ever started looking into the issue.  I know thats likely nothing that you have any control or influence over whatsoever but it influences you amp your industry so I thought Id share my personal experiences for what theyre worth.As for our business were still undecided at this time.

Theres the token training and they might take complaints and deal with them but thats after the fact.HR doesnt train people to do their jobs.  Ive never heard of this claim.  HR doesnt know what most people do at most companies.  They certainly arent equipped to train employees.HR doesnt make sure your benefits are comprehensive.  They make sure the company is paying just enough to get the quality of employees they need.  Attrition due to poor compensation is generally ignored because hiring a new person is cheaper anyway from the point of view of HR.If youre to the point of engaging HR to talk to your manager then youre probably fucked anyway and should be very actively seeking a new job.HR doesnt pay you.  Payroll does.  Some places maybe theyre closely related others theyre completely unrelated.  HR at my company has nothing to do with compensation.  It certainly has nothing to do with our k.  In fact nobody at the company really has much to do with the k and I think thats common among all companies.  Thats managed by some outside bank that pays itself by taking a cut to manage the accounts.  People are usually left to themselves to pick the funds they want to invest in too.  HR doesnt often help with that.HR acts as the advocate for the COMPANY when you need short term or long term disability coverage.  You have to be your own advocate if you need it.  ,business,cu9h7wp,5,t5_2qgzg

The victims had all taken Tylenolbranded acetaminophen capsules that had been laced with potassium cyanide. James William Lewis was convicted of extortion for sending a letter taking credit for the deaths and demanding  million to stop them and he was also the primary suspect in the killings despite living in New York City at the time. The incidents led to reforms in the packaging of overthecounter substances and to federal antitampering laws.Heres what the makers of Tylenol didgtJohnson amp Johnson distributed warnings to hospitals and distributors and halted Tylenol production and advertising. On October   it issued a nationwide recall of Tylenol products an estimated  million bottles were in circulation with a retail value of over US  million. The company also advertised in the national media for individuals not to consume any products that contained acetaminophen. When it was determined that only capsules were tampered with Johnson amp Johnson offered to exchange all Tylenol capsules already purchased by the public with solid tablets.If you are VW you admit wrongdoing.

Most people getting into a sport will try cheap products or rentals first to figure out if they are actually going to stick with it.  If they like it and stick with it theyll buy better andor bigger.      At least for me this is what happened when I first started skiing and kite surfing.   I rented then bought cheap then bought more expensive gear.   Kind of a natural progressive combination of skill and equipment.

I was kinda taken aback and didnt respond and he was like Well me neither and those niggas think its MY JOB fix their credit report and call me Uncle Tom and shit when I tell em they couldnt finance a bicycle.I thought he was joking at first but I came to understand he was made to feel Out of his place by other black people who expected him to advocate on their behalf against the man or something like that.

Once upon a time it was a degree expressly designed for professionals mostly engineers but other professionals as well with significant work experience i.e.  years to get a background in accounting management and finance to allow them to ascend into senior management positions. In other words this was a top up so the professional would understand and work with other senior managers who had a business education.As business schools recognized it was a degree they could charge med school type tuition for they loosened standards to the extent a minority of MBA students are professionals most have commerce degrees or significant actual work experience in their profession. So admissions standards dropped in order to increase tuition income for the school.Concurrently business schools continuously contracted the duration of the study. What was a two year full time degree became  months then one year or even less than one year  If you pay extra you can get an MBA in  years or less of weekends in contrast with  years of  days of classes.All of this is being done because the schools can get away with it and make money.

6443297,0,t3_3r0b5l,I own a bar in our fifth year now. of barsrestaurants fail within  years.  A good chunk of those that survive  years never achieve success ie the owner still has a real job to make ends meet.  Only a very small percent will generate any wealth beyond what you could get working a decent  hour a week job.You will never get financing for a bar.   Lenders are well aware of the failure rate and any potential assets kitchen equipment coolers ect are only worth pennies on the dollar.   I dont care if youre already open and can show k a year in profits they will want a note on your home for a k expansion loan...Get a job at a bar.  Better yet get a job at three bars so you can work  hours a week and get a feel for what a prolonged erratic and low sleep schedule feels like.   Of your three bar jobs one should be a major franchise so you can get a grasp on corporate level training and structure.  One should be a reasonably successful independent and the third should be an abject failure in every way imaginable.  The experience comparison will be invaluable. Work as a line cook for a couple of years in a place that is going to be busy enough to put you in the weeds often.Volunteer for every crap detail at the bar.   If someone pukes be the first to clean it up.  In fact clean the entire place religiously.   Start with the floor sinks open air floor drains beneath the any sinks.   Clean the draft drain line.    Unload all the beer coolers and clean them from top to bottom.    You need to get desensitized to the level of gross or become so offended by it that you never let equipment get in that condition in the first place.Learn how to maintain all of the equipment.  Maintaining equipment properly will save a small fortune yearly.   If someone comes to the bar to repair equipment watch them.  The first time you pay someone  to change a  thermopipe on a fryer and watch them fix it in under  minutes you will never pay  again.   And you wont be down a fryer during a rush waiting on a repair guy.Learn how to pull a urinal and use muriatic acid.   Learn how to seat a toilet and replace a toilet flange.  Get a copy of quickbooks and start running your personal life and expenses like a business.Take an economics class.Take an HVAC repair class.Take a basic carpentry class.Take an electric circuits class.Take a programming class.Get a food sanitation certificate.,business,czlrysl,1,t5_2qgzg

For an infant to receive a  mSv dose they would have to ingest  Bq of tritiated water an adult would have to ingest over  million Bq for  mSv.  picocurries equals  Bq meaning an infant would have to drink just under  Litres of the contaminated water to receive a dose of  mSv  litres for adult. For comparison the dose limit in one year for a nuclear worker is  mSvyr and  mSvyr.gtThis is only an issue if the leak occurs for a long time. As it is it is not an issue. That a monitoring well picked it up was a good sign.gtData pulled from ICRP  Annex F ALI  mSvEffective Dose Coefficient for tritiated watergtHopefully a health physicist can confirm my numbers.gtEdit some extra math if the tritiated water were to remain year round reaching the dose of  mSvyr would require an activity of about  Bqlitre for an adult assuming . litres per day.The lower bound estimate of the leak was  Bqlitre.gtThe natural background radiation in the states is about  mSvyr.This isnt something you should call highly radioactive unless youre trying to fear monger.,business,czr53vb,5,t5_2qgzg

My first step was to identify the cause of it and figure out what I could do to remove it and get past it.Basically what was holding me back was circumstantial. Before I continue let me say that there are people who say that patience and waiting it out will help because opportunity is on its own schedule. I agree. But I didnt want to limit myself to the opportunities in that st company. So I just exposed myself to more opportunities by applying elsewhere to see what I can get Eventually I lateraled to a different company without similar circumstances that would hold me back and have had great success and upward movement.I know this might be a different answer than what you might expect or get but it has worked for me. ,business,d1j7ga8,2,t5_2qgzg

You must be a law school schill or someone who went to an elite school bc you are out of touch. Almost everyone I know who went regrets the decision bc the work sucks and they make way less than what they anticipated and what the schools advertised all while being strapped with debt that makes buying a house or starting a family impossible. Look no further than the lowered admission standards for middle of the road schools to see how desperate the schools are to keep up enrollments.  Also look how some schools have had their class sizes cut nearly in half in the last  years. The word is out that law school is a horrible investment and that the work itself is boring and soul draining. Take your defense of law school and tell it to the many jds I know waiting tables and working in compliance jobs where a law degree isnt required.

Thats why its going for k here is because the value is loooooong gone. So in no way did he buy  million dollars of debt. He bought what someone wanted for what they had long since written off so that they could get what they could for it. This was all pretty much just written off.

There are bonuses and stock options but theyre whats known as golden handcuffs. The bonus is split up and paid once per year over two years. If you leave Amazon for ANY reason before two years is up you must pay it back. Stock is what is known as RSU so while youll get a bunch of stock you can only use it in chunks. Your starting amount of stock vests over  yearsaverage time an employee stays at Amazon is  and while its vesting you cant do anything with it. Most bonuses are given in stock which only vest after your current allotment vests. So if you get  shares in your first year youll have to wait  years before you can touch it.Amazon does work you to the bone and lies about it in interviews. I have a neighbor who has only been working for a year but is considering leaving. He was told he would be on call once every  weeks.

While that may be true and Id ask for a source but Ill just go with it for now youre looking at one single cherrypicked metric to measure the health of a product! Having zero downtime but staggeringly high transaction times doesnt equal a product working in a manner that society can approve of.Imagine if I ran a hosting company who sites were down nearly  of the time. Thats awful right? But no worries my competent support staff will answer your queries within  seconds of receiving them  hours a day every single day. They might not tell you anything useful or fix anything but by golly theyll answer them!

Along with UnitedHealth Group and Humana.  Thats like if Verizon ATampT and Tmobile suddenly decided its in their best interest to not play at all.  You act as if the other companies can succeed and survive but you dont know what theyre going to do either considering three of the largest companies have already exited.  If it was such a wonderful gold rush companies would be entering the market not exiting.  So your entire logic is based on your own assumed beliefs and not what makes business sense for companies that do hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue combined. Its like when people on Reddit opine on what Walmart should do. Its a fun game but also laughable that you think you know more about the business and industry than do these behemoths.

9225195,0,t3_56ptr7,At this years RSA Conference Tripwire conducted a survey where it asked  security professionals to weigh in on the state of phishing attacks.More than half  percent of respondents stated their organizations had seen an increase in phishing attacks in the past year. Despite that increase most companies didnt feel prepared to protect themselves against phishing scams. Indeed a slight majority  percent stated they were not confident in their executives ability to successfully spot a phishing scam.The growth of phishing attacks in both frequency and sophistication as noted by Verizon in its  Data Breach Investigations Report poses a significant threat to all organizations. Its important that all companies know how to spot some of the most common phishing scams if they are to protect their corporate information.With that in mind I will use a guide developed by CloudPages to discuss six common phishing attacks deceptive phishing spear phishing CEO fraud pharming Dropbox phishing and Google Docs phishing. I will then provide some useful tips on how organizations can protect themselves against these phishing scams.. DECEPTIVE PHISHINGThe most common type of phishing scam deceptive phishing refers to any attack by which fraudsters impersonate a legitimate company and attempt to steal peoples personal information or login credentials. Those emails frequently use threats and a sense of urgency to scare users into doing the attackers bidding.For example PayPal scammers might send out an attack email that instructs them to click on a link in order to rectify a discrepancy with their account. In actuality the link leads to a fake PayPal login page that collects a users login credentials and delivers them to the attackers.The success of a deceptive phish hinges on how closely the attack email resembles a legitimate companys official correspondence. As a result users should inspect all URLs carefully to see if they redirect to an unknown website. They should also look out for generic salutations grammar mistakes and spelling errors scattered throughout the email.. SPEAR PHISHINGNot all phishing scams lack personalization  some use it quite heavily.For instance in spear phishing scams fraudsters customize their attack emails with the targets name position company work phone number and other information in an attempt to trick the recipient into believing that they have a connection with the sender.The goal is the same as deceptive phishing lure the victim into clicking on a malicious URL or email attachment so that they will hand over their personal data.Spearphishing is especially commonplace on social media sites like LinkedIn where attackers can use multiple sources of information to craft a targeted attack email.To protect against this type of scam organizations should conduct ongoing employee security awareness training that among other things discourages users from publishing sensitive personal or corporate information on social media. Companies should also invest in solutions that are capable of analyzing inbound emails for known malicious linksemail attachments.. CEO FRAUDSpear phishers can target anyone in an organization even top executives. Thats the logic behind a whaling attack where fraudsters attempt to harpoon an executive and steal their login credentials.In the event their attack proves successful fraudsters can choose to conduct CEO fraud the second phase of a business email compromise BEC scam where attackers impersonate an executive and abuse that individuals email to authorize fraudulent wire transfers to a financial institution of their choice.Whaling attacks work because executives often dont participate in security awareness training with their employees. To counter that threat as well as the risk of CEO fraud all company personnel  including executives  should undergo ongoing security awareness training.Organizations should also consider amending their financial policies so that no one can authorize a financial transaction via email.. PHARMINGAs users become more savvy to traditional phishing scams some fraudsters are abandoning the idea of baiting their victims entirely. Instead they are resorting to pharming  a method of attack which stems from domain name system DNS cache poisoning.The Internets naming system uses DNS servers to convert alphabetical website names such as www.microsoft.com to numerical IP addresses used for locating computer services and devices.Under a DNS cache poisoning attack a pharmer targets a DNS server and changes the IP address associated with an alphabetical website name. That means an attacker can redirect users to a malicious website of their choice even if the victims entered in the correct website name.To protect against pharming attacks organizations should encourage employees to enter in login credentials only on HTTPSprotected sites. Companies should also implement antivirus software on all corporate devices and implement virus database updates along with security upgrades issued by a trusted Internet Service Provider ISP on a regular basis.. DROPBOX PHISHINGWhile some phishers no longer bait their victims others have specialized their attack emails according to an individual company or service.Take Dropbox for example. Millions of people use Dropbox every day to back up access and share their files. Its no wonder therefore that attackers would try to capitalize on the platforms popularity by targeting users with phishing emails.One attack campaign for example tried to lure users into entering their login credentials on a fake Dropbox signin page hosted on Dropbox itself.To protect against Dropbox phishing attacks users should consider implementing twostep verification SV on their accounts. For a stepbystep guide on how to activate this additional layer of security please click here.. GOOGLE DOCS PHISHINGFraudsters could choose to target Google Drive similar to the way they might prey upon Dropbox users.Specifically as Google Drive supports documents spreadsheets presentations photos and even entire websites phishers can abuse the service to create a web page that mimics the Google account login screen and harvests user credentials.A group of attackers did just that back in July of . To add insult to injury not only did Google unknowingly host that fake login page but a Google SSL certificate also protected the page with a secure connection.Once again users should consider implementing SV to protect themselves against this type of threat. They can enable the security feature via either SMS messaging or the Google Authenticator app.CONCLUSIONUsing the guide above organizations will be able to more quickly spot some of the most common types of phishing attacks. But that doesnt mean they will be able to spot each and every phish. On the contrary phishing is constantly evolving to adopt new forms and techniques.With that in mind its imperative that organizations conduct security awareness training on an ongoing basis so that their employees and executives stay on top of emerging phishing attacks.,business,d8ld0og,1,t5_2qgzg

9362571,0,t1_d91mtnc,No you shouldnt.  And nobodys saying that ANY regulation is a bad thing.  However perusing the label on any bottle of medication will shed light on the fact that even the most benign drug carries with it extraordinary health risks especially if used incorrectly.  In fact there are entire fields of medicine where the specific intent is to make you sick because that side effect is better than dying of the disease thats being treated.  Ask any cancer patient.So despite the side effects despite the very real statistical possibility that you will die taking approved and prescribed medication as directed the FDA has to find the right balance.  At what point are the negatives acceptable for a drug that will actually save some people even if it kills others where the alternative is that everybody is going to die.This is all great when the great medical ailment youre trying to cure is a bad headache.  However when youve got a terminal disease and youre going to die soon anyway and youre willing to accept the risk of having a medication officially be what kills you instead then theres some logic in saying that trying every experimental drug available as a last ditch effort to survive makes some small amount of sense and the last thing youd want is the FDA telling you that its too dangerous because an unacceptable number of rats arent making it through the testing.,business,d92ruf5,1,t5_2qgzg

And thats essentially most of the last mile at that point. You may as well bring it to the house if youre that close. For reliability you want fiber to the home.

We then have  women come out and say he did exactly what he claims to have done on the tape.. We have a video of him pulling a woman to him and kissing her without consent just as he claims to do in the hot mic tape. Finally we have denial.This was actually a pattern of Trump. He would make a claim that was unsavory. People would come out and verify it. Then he would deny it was true.For example on Howard Stern he claimed to go back stage to the dressing rooms at the pageants he owned because he could get away with it. We then had several women including  individuals who were participants in Miss Teen USA and were  at the time of the event who claimed Trump did just that  just what he said. And then Trump came out and denied it.Maybe it is my fault. Maybe I am wrong about this and there is just something wrong with my brain or the way I think. But I feel like if someone says they do X when they dont think concerned people are listening and then others confirm it not just one or two but  it will be hard for me to believe their denial without counterbalancing evidence.,business,d9wdgu0,0,t5_2qgzg

If the medication is always prompting the response your body begins to expect it and wont work as hard to clear the passage on its own.

Bird people tend to be extremely specific to their birds which is a a valuable thing because they can usually need a great deal of interaction. In exchange youre able to enjoy their complicated and hilarious personalities. Joyfully picking a crate for him was significantly easier. After I looked into his needs for a crate I came across that there were many excellent cages on the market. The exact same does work for the bird long lasting breed may possibly be. Small birds like finches need certainly to have the ability to travel in their cage while large birds like macaws require lots of space to stretch out as well as ultrastrong bars to keep them in. Cockatiels are one of those species of chickens that falls in to that hole between little birds and medium parrots. Theyre noted for having peaceful and affectionate personalities that is one of many factors theyre common pets. In fact their personality is so submissive that they may be bullied by different chickens also little chickens like parakeets. If you plan to house them with others watch them careful to ensure theyre maybe not maltreated. Needless to say there will be some overlap in what crate is most effective for which birds. Generally the heavier and tougher the bird the stronger the bars need certainly to be. Budgies and parrotlets frequently do just fine with gentle gauge bars but as soon as youre able to anything with a very good beak just like a Timneh it is additionally vital to spend money on something a little stronger.,business,daoygur,1,t5_2qgzg

Ideally you will run into someone who knows your guys boss or his bosss boss or someone who has access to them.But more importantly my outside perception of the airline industry is of general caution and strong centralized control... meaning this may be a hard sell anyway since your guy may still need all kinds of internal approval just to try something out. I bring that up to say you need to be reaching out to other airlines as well. Southwest is always touted as a bastion of initiative and success through development maybe try approaching them?Not sure if your tech is applicable as a service to the airlinei.e. start your own company that service but if so your investors ideally will be able to open doors to airline board members banks etc who can get you closer to the decision maker.Also maybe you would have better luck selling to a manufacturer or existing airline servicer who could bundle your tech into their offering?

10315592,0,t3_5nplpw,Hi KatieThe challenge with email marketing to optometrists is that you may need personal and business email addresses. So it is good to select a vendor who can offer you both. Most vendors may not provide you only email addresses of optometrists since it has to abide by CANSPAM and other regulations. I have however come across a few that do. Lake BB Healthcare Marketers Span Global Services for instance does so  but I selected Healthcare Marketers for  specific reasons.. They specialize in healthcare data. They have over  million data on healthcare professionals and seemed to have better understanding of the sectors and its challenges. They allow to purchase databyselects. So I didnt really have to buy an entire optometrist email address list but could choose relevant data as per my requirements. And they also provide healthcare data appending services. This proved good because like most others I too have existing customers  some of whom are inactive. So appending seemed like the best way to update data on them and reactive the accounts!Hope the details help!,business,dcdbu51,1,t5_2qgzg

10462936,0,t1_dcsx19h,Im so sick of this automation argument against bringing back manufacturing to the United States. We will build the factories that the robots work in. And we will mine and forge the metal the robots are made from. And we will produce the energy the robots need to run on. And we maintain the rails and roads and airports that we use to ship the goods the robots made. What about the teams of architects that stamped the drawings to the plant that the teams of engineers designed that the urban planners zoned? I bet those teams had a lot of lunches and many cups of coffee to get the job done. Or the company that not just made the raw cement but shipped the cement to then turn into concrete. Then there is the crew of guys that turn cement into concrete and pour it on site. Turns out that company needs trucks someone has to make those. What about the company that made the sign on the door? Or the crew that pained the side of the building and has to every  years or so. Oh and this plant wants some landscaping so the nursery that grew the plants that the landscape architect designed the layout for. Now we need a landscape crew to come in once a week and cut the grass! It also turns out that people want to steal expensive machinery so now we need security on guard  and those guys need uniforms and cameras. This list goes on and on and on just like a strong economy should. Our economy is centered around the production of goods and services. People think so small minded. If robots are the future why would you want them all in China? Why not have them here? There is a lot more that goes into manufacturing than just the people on the assembly line. ,business,dcu2whm,1,t5_2qgzg

Furthermore Patent Pending marks do not satisfy the statutory marking requirement so they cant be used to enhance damages either once again as best I recall.Essentially all the Patent Pending marking does is attract consumers by suggesting that there is something exclusive or inventive in the device which may or may not be true since the manufacturer may or may not ever get the patent and it also might warn businesses not to invest in setting up a production line lest the patent issue and force them into a license or shutdown.,business,dd7ld2r,1,t5_2qgzg

I am going to guess you are young and have not yet had to rely on health care in the US. Since you are fixated on shopping for health careHave you ever done this? I have. I dont get answers. In fact I asked how much a cane was my doctors office was giving me. They said they didnt know. It would be billed to my insurance.  You know what my answers for health care questions have been? It varies. Its true it does vary but that doesnt really help me shop for a better price. I came down with spinal stenosis. Someone recommended a place to me. The place turned out to be a physical therapistchiropractor. I went there a couple weeks. It didnt work. After trying that place and finding out it sucked I was left to go to another place. Barely able to walk do you really think I wanted to waste another several months with subpar care? I could barely walk. I wantedneeded to go some place that would help and not waste my time and money.  And Im not alone in this. People in the US in general dont shop around for the best price in health care. Do you really want to sacrifice quality healthcare for a bargain price? If you are seeing a doctor you must be seeing one because you need health care not because you need a physical.

It will be another  to  for the inverter.  Not bad at all.I will put the panels on the roof myself and wire them together.  I build vacuum tube hifi gear for fun and am a licensed amateur radio operator so I know about electricity and Im a bythebook kind of guy.  I will hire a licensed electrician to do the final work and integrate the inverter with utility power.Hopefully by the end of the year I will order one of the Tesla home batteries.  Those are .  To be safe lets say it will be about  total.  Theres a  federal tax credit which will be about .So I think it will end up about  total.  I live in Arizona where sunlight is not a problem and bills for AC can reach  to  a month.  Roughly I think it will save me about  a year on electricity.  It should pay for itself in five years.You also have to look at equity.  A house with solar and a battery around here will be worth  more than a similar house without.So the way I look at it I will be at least  ahead the day solar is installed.  Solar is totally totally totally worth it.Finally Im looking for a used Nissan Leaf.  Did you know theyre ridiculously cheap?  You can find a nice one for around .  Range is maybe  miles but its a rare day when I drive more than  miles locally.  Thats  of my driving.  I have a reliable gasoline car thats paid off.

11619732,0,t1_dgcb75v,gt If you order something with the Free Shipping on Amazon Amazon will ship it out at absolutely the last second.But with Prime you get  day shipping on anything sold bythrough them. rd party stuff isnt included unless theyre set up for FBA as well. So if it gets sent out last minute it doesnt matter youre still getting it in  days. If not you call up and theyll give you a free month of prime. Allegedly Ive never done it myself. And they also have Sunday delivery. Often times the mailman will deliver my Amazon package on a Sunday at no extra cost which is quite shocking  apparently they have some sort of deal with the USPS. Its nice getting packages on Sunday all my olderelderly neighbors see the mailman drive up and drop off a package on a Sunday and probably wonder WTF? P I dont know why but all my neighbors are obsessed with their mail as if its the most important thing in the world to them.Oh and prime also has video streaming as well as some other stuff I dont utilize so I dont remember. Their streaming service isnt half bad.gt Amazon seems like they have automated price matching which isnt helping thoughI actually like this feature a lot. I think its beenbeing abused by people who figured a way to get their automation to drop the price and often times I believe I was indirectly a beneficiary of the bug. It doesnt happen often and only on certain products but I have noticed the prices temporarily dropping to eyepoppingly low prices. Strangely enough never usually with electronics. Mostly highend clothing and odd knickknacks and home supplies like packing tape or toothbrushes ,business,dgd3vlo,1,t5_2qgzg

It needs to change.I highlight recommend you read The Real World of Technology by Ursula Franklin. So good. She talks about technology as a prescriptive  process. She discusses some of these things that were talking about. Howe we need to better shape the house that technology built so that we dont hurt people in the process.I am always reminded of a Rosanne episode where people were picking off spoons and forks and knives off of plastic moulds and putting them in boxes because they couldnt figure out a machine to reliably do it.,business,dgkoc4t,2,t5_2qgzg

11805987,0,t3_682al0,Fire immediately. Bad employees cost you money.We hired a senior dev. His resume was long and storied. He was well spoken during the interviews and seemed to give the right answers. We made him an offer.It was perhaps the worst team hire we made. He struggled for over two months just to get his operating system and his tools working right on his laptop far beyond what anyone else experienced. His code was a mess and he got beat up a lot on his code reviews. He was always slow to get things done and left early every day. Productivity suffered for the whole team as there was a lot of handholding that wasted everyones time. We were paying for a senior dev who was worse than a junior dev.Lucky for him our manager left in the middle of his  day probationary period and the new manager didnt want to make a quick decision she was worried that the team might be unfairly beating up on him. So he survived the day probation and it was WAY harder to get him out the door once she saw the light.,business,dgy8zlm,1,t5_2qgzg
