4154090,0,t1_crtna29,people keep talking about this esrb thing as if they rate things completely objectively. they dont  even their main ratings have sub categories comic mischief violence blood and gore etc to put things in more context.the world of mortal kombat is entirely fantastical from the ground up. the leader of the good guys is the actual god of thunder. the bad guys come from an alternate dimension where pretty much everyone is monsters. theres an actual dimension where dead people who have been reanimated with actual black magic rule. all of these things are taken in stride and never questioned. by contrast like you said hatred guy is a guy who exists in a world that is not on the surface demonstrably different from ours. the frontend of the game is his justification that hes gone angsty and wants to kill everyone simply because they are there. theres much less fantasy except for the glory of violence against presumably innocent people. GTA even has a more significant justification to their violence with their story of criminals doing criminal things largely against the authorities rather than against the masses.,neogaming,crts2lj,3,t5_34466

5472291,0,t1_cwab2pb,The status quo for a long time has been that particularly adult games can be released uncensored but not on Steam. However that is starting to change And thats for a game with sex scenes not something that just has skimpy outfits like Dragons Crown.It does give me hope that the developer said we are exploring solutions rather than some dismissive nonanswer. Devspublishers get themselves into some real hot water if they promise things they cant deliver most infamously Peter Molyneux so this indicates Vanillaware are pretty confident about their chances with this. Plenty of Eastern devs have had success in the past with ports to PC so heres hoping some time soon well be seeing Dragons Crown and their other titles there.,neogaming,cwb4xl5,2,t5_34466

5751278,0,t1_cx9yje5,Treyarch now gives us the third game in the series in which we follow a Black Ops soldier If you are one of those people who bothered to play campaign of course.There are few of the characters you get to knowand worst of all is the main character protagonist you play as. I choose the word protagonist over main character since there is no character.Although the story picks up slightlybut it is not enough to stave off monotony and limited gameplay.and a greater variety of enemies.But I will not just give bad criticisms criticizeA machine implant inside our protagonist gets up introduced early in the storyWhether you are controlling their computers pushing them your enemies awayThis I do not understand the point of this.So the main game experience is for the multiplayer mode. Black Ops  have had has a lot of trouble with game crashes and falling out of disconnecting from the game serversso you must link up reconnect again.ltspacegtThis is rather inconvenient and creates a lot of irritation when you want to play with friends who keep falling out disconnecting one by one.all the good old multiplayer classics such as free for allWhat is new in this mode is the choices a way to customize your character called specialists.if you have a weapon you like you can decorate your weapon it with its own design.It reminds a lot about is very reminiscent of Titanfalls movement systemit gives a good flow of to the gameYour Youre equippedfloat in for a short periodgiving the opportunity to exploit explore the various pathsAnd since Black Ops  is a Treyarch game there is of course also a zombie mode. Visually It looks cool with and has a unique style which characterizes the experience.which you discovers will soon discover as the characters faces are modeled after those of the actors face.and set out trapsIts Theres nothing new that really stands out.NOTESgt The missions can quickly last over an hour and half and it quickly becomes very long when all you do is run and shoot. Used the word quickly twice in a sentence. Feels bad man.gt Treyarch made some cool movie sequences and visual clips that work in transition with the gameplay.Something cannot work in transition with something else. Something can be in transition though. Not sure what this sentence means.gt Transition from gameplay video clips are often not polished at all and seems very choppy so credit to Treyarch here. credit to implies you think this is a good thing and you are crediting them for the experience.,neogaming,cxa022t,3,t5_34466

Toss in a couple closetogether highprofile releases and you get this silly return of Japanese gaming narrative as though we havent recently had Bayonetta  Metal Gear Solid V Final Fantasy  etc. The real story is Japanese developers finally picking up the PC as a platform to put their games on. ,neogaming,dfdh82b,2,t5_34466
