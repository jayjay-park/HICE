7015054,0,t1_d1bhjsu,How am I screwing them over by putting money into a system that probably wouldnt exist if only legitimate customers used it? Every dispensary is for profit and the more customers they serve regardless of legitimacy their ability to serve improves. Plus who knows how long it would take for a state with a pretty corruptundemocratic legislature to pass recreational. I have no moral qualms about gaming a system that shouldnt exist in the first place. ,ZonaEnts,d1bi6ba,6,t5_2tgcl

8320810,0,t3_4ta9b6, variables you missed.  You can take your doctors recommendation and most caregivers will accept that.  Sadly most people including the police and judges think you need a card. They dont know the law.  A doctors recommendation is the  prices you see in the back of magazines. nd variable  you can upload your doctors recommendation paperwork yourself.  Just go the state mmj website and take  minutes.  It will save you  pesos from your doctor visit. But I have to ask  why are you so focused on new patient specials?  It really boggles my mind how these schwag peddlers are rated by how much rolled up trim they give away..,ZonaEnts,d5hnoa5,2,t5_2tgcl
8741186,0,t3_4zrdhw,Theyre a few spots.. I am uncertain if Planet Zong is still up and running... I know Nanas off of unions hills and st Ave is decent just dont do anything stupid in the parking lot.. Bad experiences xD My favorite smoke shop is High Maintenence by far.. Their prices are a bit up marked but on some items its well worth it. If youre looking for decent prices on pieces I would recommend Arizonas Best off of Dobson and Main... another high traffic area to heed caution. ,ZonaEnts,d6yasz3,1,t5_2tgcl

11066304,0,t3_5x0a7v,If you shop at a dispensary  there is no weed smell to worry about  so its a non issue.   The burnt smell lets you know its plant matter but hardly identifiable as weed so keep some wood chips or similar incense on hand.  Lots of cheaper more effective legal plants you should be burning anyways. Tenants complain about all smells  and they assume every one of them is weed or methab so.. ,ZonaEnts,demcsl3,1,t5_2tgcl
