Remember Rob Bell whos book Love Wins where he seems to claim that there is no hell. Although Rob Bells heresy was even worse than this this is still pretty bad and will undoubtedly cause heads to explode in the conservative camp. Also Hes from Bethel which is already pretty controversial but this latest interview by him will probably get shot down by christian pastors like Mark Driscoll who preach a message of hate and partisanship within the christian community. Not that I agree with him because I dont because an accepted view of faith is that there is reason to deny Gods existence  doubt. This guy claims to give that voice of reason a hearing but then comes from a slanted perspective to rebut the reasons.

1601448,0,t1_cjgy3d7,gtWeb . has been harmful for the quality of discussion in this culture. Im not sure if its been harmful in absolute terms but I suspect it hasnt lived up to its potential for the reasons you outline. Remember that before these technologies were available people were segregated and isolated in different ways and direct exchange of information and views between people from different cultural backgrounds was if anything even harder. Exchange of information was mostly topdown through centrallycontrolled i.e. by states or large corporations media outlets and unless you knew someone in person you could hardly have a discussion with them at all productive or otherwise.Thanks to the web previouslyscattered communities such as exMuslims and indeed Humanists! are able to organise and grow and information from unofficial sources which might not be friendly to the worldview of the powers that be can make its way into cultures which have hitherto been quite insular and oppressive most Muslim countries China the exSoviet countries Africa etc.Social media is of course much better for exchanging soundbites than for meaningful and productive discussion between intelligent people ampndash Twitter discussions can often frankly be something of a race to the bottom. But its still a useful tool even if it needs a good amount of honing. I would say that on balance Web . has given the cultural critique of religion the largest push into the mainstream that its had in recent years. As a certain Youtuber likes to say the web is where religions go to die.gtWe cant wait for schools to do itThis is another good point. Even if we grant that the school curriculum impresses itself sufficiently deeply into the minds of pupils to make substantial longterm differences to how they think changes made to it now would benefit only the next generation so their effects wouldnt be seen for many years. We need to think about how people debate and discuss things now and above all try to model the changes we want to see in our own habits. The most important ambassadors for any kind of cultural change are those who are good exemplars of it and the stain of hypocrisy is extremely hard to remove.gtEveryone is capable of jumping to conclusions and being overly emotional in discussions beyond all reason. We can change that.Yes but thats going to take a huge amount of time and effort. A culture of robust intelligent discussion is not built overnight you could say that the entire project of the Enlightenment over the past gt years or so and in no small measure the Humanist project has been to build exactly such a culture. To paraphrase Jefferson we need to enlighten peoples discretion so they choose to discuss things in a more mature way. Twitter and its infamous  characters have some role to play but hopefully not a dominant one.The first thing we need to combat is the tendency to selfsegregate this is exacerbated by some social media actively filtering the content that their users see by default even Google I believe has a bias towards showing its users things they are more likely to find interesting. The problem with letting this continue unchallenged is that it leads to communities becoming even more entrenched in their established positions with productive discussion becoming ever more unlikely and the arts of compromise and learning to live together becoming more and more deprecated in effect I have recently read that the US political culture is currently in the most polarised state it has been in throughout living memory which is alarming but a large part of the problem seems to be that the Republican party has increasingly gone off the deep end in recent decades. Above all discussions should never be personalised because that poisons everything.One of my friends had an interesting suggestion the algorithms used by social media to decide what content to show users should have an occasional bias towards unfamiliar or disagreeable content to make sure that people are more wellrounded in their view of the world or are at least familiar with other opinions whether those opinions are reasonable or not ampndash of course Im not going to start claiming that every opinion deserves equal respect regardless of how poorly substantiated it is but its important that everyone has an appreciation of how other people think.,humanism,cjh158o,1,t5_2qjpn

They are not really directly comparable and one can hold both positions either one separately as well as the opposite of the other or neither at all.EDIT Also its true that Humanists are most often atheists but that probably has more to do with religions tending to have their own philosophies and stances that exclude others including Humanism rather then any particular affinity between atheism and Humanism.

3154885,0,t1_coo4sj6,My response to that and a good way to concisely express what I mean about misanthropy and humanism being difficult to maintain simultaneously is that Humanism should ABSOLUTELY be innate and for many it is. If it requires additional mindfulness to behave in a humanistic way I guess thats okay too but really seeing as were all bound by what is it to experience the human condition living in a way that puts the highest value on human interests and human dignity should have little to no intellectual component or mindfulness. Point being...you say humanism is not innate I say it really should be and if we as a species continue to evolve for long enough without blowing the shit out of the world first it will be innate for most everyone.Also thank you for the knowledge bomb you dropped by informing me that humanity and human nature are both innately human.
