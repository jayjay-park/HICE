Lower is faster compared to the default rate of .  Dungeon has a higher maxSpawns amount though .x increase versus .x increase.

After  invasions I get bored. I build myself a little arena where I can stand completely still and let my traps take out the enemies. However they seem to rush in like  wave and then wait til I seek out the next not much seeking they just pile up outside my screen. I am EXCACTLY in the center of my map and I am questioning why they do not move when i stand still ? I have no background walls or anything.  .

109638,0,t3_1vckgw, Good obsidian generator design has holding tanks with pumps from the bottom to the top for duplicating and pipes leading from fairly high on the tank walls but not above the outlet pumps down to the point where the liquids meet. I usually put the water a lava tanks next to each other the obsidian pipe between them then put honey on top and lead pipes down both sides for honey and crispy honey blocks. Clearing the corruptioncrimsonhallow entirely is not really necessary and can actually be a pain if it turns out that you eventually need some resources from them. Its normally fine to just make sure the corruptioncrimson cant eat the jungle and otherwise let them spread to their hearts content. All doors can be broken open. If you want to protect the doors use active stone or actuators to create switchable walls in front of them. Monster spawns are for the most part determined by the backwall  lack of a wall or a wall that was placed by the world generator permit them and playerplaced walls including worldgen walls that have been picked up and replaced block them. The dungeon enters hardmode independently from the rest of the world the gateway boss being Plantera which is summoned by breaking a glowing bulb in the jungle. Once in hardmode dungeon monster spawns are determined by the three different backwall styles. One style will spawn Blue Armored Bones Skeleton Commandos Necromancers and Paladins. Another style spawns Hell Armored Bones Diabolists and Tactical Skeletons and also Blazing Wheels prehardmode. The last style spawns Rusty Armored Bones Ragged Casters and Skeleton Snipers and Spike Balls prehardmode. Giant Cursed Skulls and all other prehardmode monsters spawn everywhere. In addition monsters have a chance to spawn a Dungeon Spirit on death which itself drops Ectoplasm when killed. Besides that almost all of the hardmode dungeon monsters have rare drops that are considered immensely useful like the Magnet Sphere and Sniper Rifle. Theres only really two farm designs you need to worry about the Meteor Head grinder and the Ocean grinder. Meteor Head grinders are a block of  meteorite in another biome plus some mechanism for automatically killing Meteor Heads Chlorophyte Armors set bonus is popular for this. Its hard to explain how to build an Ocean grinder but if you search this sub you should find some helpful pictures. Teleporters are bought from the Steampunker who shows up after youve beaten one of the mechanical bosses for gs. You set them up by connecting them with wires there is a limit of  wires for this and connecting a switch.

Put torches throughout the whole platform for light this is a personal preference though. For weapons I had two the Nights Edge and the Sharanga just make regular arrows because the bow turns them into spectral arrows. I took four potions with me healing potions thorn potions iron skin potions and an archery potion. During the fight I just kept firing arrow after arrow at the eye. The Nights Edge is for the leeches and those little biter things that become extremely annoying when they detach from the wallI recommend having hellstone armor and rocket boots to avoid the lasers at the end.

He couldnt just add a craftable wallmount item for each weapon because then wed have to be able to craft the weapon back from the wallmount and the prefix would be lost or changed. This was my first thought however.  The prefixes are the biggest problem for this potential addition.To maintain the prefixes I think the best method would be this  Add some sort of weaponholderrack item that can be placed on back walls.  This item will function like a chest except that it will only hold one item and it will only accept weapon items.  Besides serving as a chest and storing the weapon with its prefix even when all players exit the world the holderrack will change its sprite to display they weapon it contains.,Terraria,cgu94zt,1,t5_2sg5b

The world isnt irretrievably corrupt.  The current version of TEdit is writing the version value in the world for ... and Terraria gets confused when trying to load the world.Ive given summary instructions how to repair the world here  Ive decided on a limited time offer until an updated verison of TEdit comes out or it becomes an issue.  For anyone who isnt sure how to update the version flag Ill be willing to fix files but some rules will apply.  Please make requests by PM only.  Theres no point in cluttering discussion threads..  In your message include a link to the zipped world file with your Reddit username as the name of the file for example I would upload critcodedtuna.zip.  You can use Dropbox if you have it or you can check Google for free file upload to find a site..  Ill retrieve the map fix it verify that it loads in .. then send back a link to get the fixed version..  Please only send one file per day.

Im not sure but I think this was fixed in ....  Either way it cant hurt to have a small stack of them on hand a half dozen or so going into it.Second theres a nonobvious quirk with ocean fishing I noticed.  I had built a small pond about  blocks of water at the end of an elevated asphalt platform near sky level to make it easier to summon and start the fight.  Everything about it behaved like an ocean biome except fishing.  The fix is to increase the pond size to over  blocks of water and it should work.  Use regular bait and see what you catch.  If youre getting lots of bass and no expected ocean catches tuna red snapper shrimp etc. you might have a similar issue.,Terraria,ci298nr,1,t5_2sg5b

With a server you CAN force the time to change but not everyone is willing to set up a local server or knows how to do so just so they can get a Terra Blade faster.And TShock is modding the game something that fewer people are willing to do than run a local server. This is me speaking personally but if youre willing to mod the game to take out some of the random nature of the game then I dont think you can rightfully comment on how hard or easy something is. If youve actually obtained a Terra Blade without mods at least once which I want to say you have  being hopeful and everything then Id be more willing to listen to what you have to say. However your admitting to using mods as a way around something thats meant to be rare has made me lose what respect I might have had for you.Id like to say as well that Im fine with game mods. They can add to a games experience and increase playtime if it adds stuff like the Rebirth mods.

1389224,0,t3_2a0gyy, Last week my pc bluescreened and I lost my world and main character Char name was red and looked like the default sprite and my world had no spaces in its name. I tried to find a way to get my world back in google but all I found was to use the backup feature of windows which my pc doesnt have... I tried using the .bak of my world but it seems like it got corrupted too somehow. TEdit just gives me an error and the program crashes. TSGE says it cant open my character. It was the first time I was playing without cheating and got to beat the three mech bosses which previously would be impossible for me to do without hacking so its quite a bummer for me...I made a new world and tried to rebuild my village with screenshots I had made along with my memory. The worlds got a nice terrain and my houses are looking even better than the original ones. But its just not the same. I dont feel connected to my new village nor my world. I spent an inmense ammount of hours exploring my world to the point where I knew all the paths and the location of every single structure in my world. And now its just gone. I have to start exploring from scratch. Sorry because I dont have a way to get your world back. I just wanted you guys to know that I feel your pain. I stopped playing for a few days after I lost my world. Its hard for me to keep playing now considering how far into the game I was.

1743186,0,t3_2eds8m,The biggest issue in Hardmode is getting good weapons and accessories  these will make a world of difference in the later postmetal HM bosses. I personally suggest getting a decent HM starter weapon and farming the underground ice biome for a while. Things will be tough for a while but youll be set for a long time if you can get a hold of a frost scythe or frost staff. Hell. My first Golem kill was with turtle armor amp a frost scythe.... Some things to consider  Make a bridge in hell and do some more farming of the WoF. Youll want to make at least one Avengers Emblem the accessory you get for combining all  emblems. Plus if you make a hollowed hell bridge it makes farming crystal shards super easy. This may be complicated if the bigger HM imps show up though. Those things are a pain in the ass. If you havent built a garden already for herbs start thinking about it. I personally prefer using clay pots. Youre going to want to get one going for moonglow daybloom and deathweed for battle potions. keep key molds in mind when youre farming. You will undoubtedly want a hallowed frost and crimson key mold at some point. It could be argued that these three weapons break the game.  If it starts raining run to the jungle. Pop a battle potion. Put a water candle down somewhere. And kill every angry nimbus that spawns. A nimbus rod basically makes the HM bosses a joke.  Need money? Once you have the Golem down farm the temple for power cells and kill the Golem over and over. Use the picksaw to move the altar to a long flat surface. Or do the Pumpkin Moon event. Either one will net you more platinum than you will ever need.,Terraria,cjyw2mr,1,t5_2sg5b

1749838,0,t3_2egtpb,Alright. As soon as Hardmode starts blah blah blah bless your world with ore.BUT BEFORE YOU DO THIS Make sure you have a few Spelunker Potions.Go. Mine. Do whatever you want. Get your CobaltPalladium right away. Make the Drill or Pickaxe I prefer Pickaxe it has knockback. because the Molten Pickaxe is a real pain in the speed. Now you have the option to...A Gather more CobaltPalladium and create armorweapons out of itB Immediately begin mining MythrilOricalcum For the sake of spelling I will call that Oric. for short. and create the MythrilOric. anvil.If you choose A you will eventually get to B but slower. Lets assume you chose B.Get the PickaxeDrill. ASAP. Go deeper into your world for AdamantiteTitanium Lets call this T ores.Start mining these. As soon as you have enough convert your Hellforge into your T oreforgefurnace whatever its called. Now you can start making T Bars.Note AdamantiteTitanium is a pain in the neck to search for. Arm yourself with Spelunker potions. Try going to the Underworld and searching the ceiling as there could very well be lots of ores there. Now make the whole set of Adamantite Your choice of helmetheadgearmask or whatever. You should be pretty buffed out in armor at least for a while.Afterwards you will want to make your way to the Jungle. Yes the Jungle. Try not to die. If you have a Dark Lance this is the absolute most perfect time to use it. Stab all those Angry Trappers sorry if this spoils anything. You will want to sweep the Jungle for Life Fruit an item that will permanently increase your health by  to a maximum of . Again poke everything you see.Finally at least for this portion of my useful guides go to your closest Floating Island or make a huge platform. it really does not matter as long as youre up into the antigravity zone. Use stabby things. Kill Wyverns multihit things work too. Acquire spoiler. Acquire any kind of feather or do certain things to craft spoiler or you can spoiler it. The rest of my thoughts is just one big spoiler. If you want these spoilers revealed just say so.,Terraria,cjzq55t,2,t5_2sg5b

2003478,0,t3_2ho4h2,I think the idea of a pure summoner class is a bit too limiting. Summoners likely exceed the DPS of any other class while maintaining good survivability if they devote  slots to minion boosting accessories and otherwise use regular armor instead of spookytiki. With a Necromantic Scroll Papyrus Scarab and Pygmy Necklace you can have  Sharknados that do ! damage each and still have  accessory slots and any armor you want. Think of it this way  each of those three accessory slots adds  to your damage capability far more than any other offensive accessory can offer.Id thus go as far as to say that the summoner class easily outshines every other class because of higher damage capability and similar survivability. The issue is that most believe that the way to play a summoner is to wear tikispooky armor and  minionboosting accessories to max out the number of minions and their damage.,Terraria,ckum8x6,1,t5_2sg5b
2003714,0,t1_ckumyop,Minions might follow you but that doesnt mean that its logical that they continuously need to check something youre wearing for their stats such as what damage they inflict or what knockback they have. Such things are usually inherent in the mob itself and are established at the time of summoning.It does however make sense that some gear binds the minions to the summoner and if removed the minions leave. Thats why for instance a Pygmy Necklace needs to be left on to retain a minion while a Hercules Beetle which only boosts damageknockback at the time of summoning can be safely removed after summoning. In any event you need to demonstrate that gear swapping is unintended. Its hardly an established fact and furthermore it arguably makes more sense for it to work the way it currently does. On top of that given that removing some armoraccessories DOES impact minions and removing other accessories doesnt this strongly suggests that everything is working as intended.,Terraria,ckun9pg,-1,t5_2sg5b

One thing I find is that it doesnt work if you dont change the server port from  to something else. If you are running it on the computer you are using click join and type localhost then enter the server port when prompted. For others to connect over LAN use your ipv address found after entering ipconfig into command prompt. If they are connecting from outside of your internet look up your IP on Google and use that. Either IP is entered on the join screen then the custom server port.Hope this helped sorry its a little long.

It has nothing to do with the casual part of the game at all aside from Adventure mode and character specific Break The Targets.Characters fell a lot quicker and were generally faster. Melee also has a somewhat unofficial technique called Wavedashing. The airdodging in Melee is directional and you retain momentum when doing it towards the ground.

3445206,0,t1_cpkyk8w,gt Are you arguing against that or not grasping that it is what Im talking about?Nice attitude.I dont think we need pure summoner weapons. In order to make up for the extra damage you get from your minions a summoner weapon should be less powerful than a fully kitted rangedmeleemagic weapon right? But we already have plenty of less powerful weapons for summoners to use! Their only problem is that they arent labeled as summoner weapons.gt But no one who posts a playthrough branded as a melee playthrough is using range classed weapons... Rangers use ranger weapons because those are the most effective for them due to the armor bonuses. Same for melee and magic. But for summoners the weapon class is not a concern since summoner weapons wouldnt and shouldnt be better than unbonused weapons from other classes anyway or the class would become way too powerful.My bottom line is if you choose to restrict yourself arbitrarily by labels as opposed to using whats most effective then why arent you willing to deal with the consequences of your OWN choice?

If you want to keep your spawn area pure set up barricades of noncorruptible blocks about  thick.

3767586,0,t1_cql8nmv,I worked out a way to keep wraiths at bay but its time consuming to wire up and rig together not to mention it takes forever to mine enough worlds of their spiky ball traps. I just make little x spiky ball trap cells that surround the entire foundation of my base and go up into the walls where I keep my npcs. As far as construction of the cells the top row in each holds the traps themselves leaving x empty spaces in which the balls bounce around. Separate each cell by one layer of whatever material you want I build it into the foundation and so used the same material and make sure theyre enclosedyou dont want any spiky balls getting out. And as mentioned previously wire it all up to a switch of some sort thats easy to access. Finally use whatever timerengine you want to have it activate repeatedly. I just used the  second block myself.Next time a blood moon hits just throw that switch and you have built in protection from wraiths. Its not perfect as occasionally one tenacious bugger will still get through.

3938044,0,t1_cr4vudw,Yes those are crystal balls that is a dog pet. As for increasing the liquid it is sort of a glitch that has been around since the Devs created the pumps and they never bothered to fix it because of the convenience i guess. As long as the liquid is above the inlet pump the outlet pump actually puts out a lil more then the inlet takes in. Try it yourself make a small tank  wide by  high and put the inlet at the bottom and the outlet at the top but lower then the top of the tank like i have then put enough water into it to go above the inlet put a  sec timer on it and turn it on. Come back in  min and you will have more water then when you started. If you put just barley enough to cover the inlet it can take a lil while to start increasing because it starts slower. I recommend putting enough water to be  block over the top of the inlet. Hero on YouTube has tons of videos about Terraria and that is where i learned about it. I recommend subscribing to him.

4054151,0,t1_crieaxb,I never said you were calling Terraria a subpar game it just seems odd to be jumping to conclusions so early. Nobody knows what the game is going to be like until there is a bit more info given on it.And yeah its a similar game  but the art style is very different as you pointed out and we havent been given specifics on objectives  playability  so any comment on gameplay is pure speculation at the moment. But what we can agree on is that Terraria is anything but a subpar game its brilliant  and its Reds franchise. So why would he stray too far away? Its not being a one trick pony  its establishing a brand and expanding at the same time as rereleasing content for Terraria. Thats amazing and its a fucking blessing compared to other developers who squeeze so much out of unfinished content and have the nerve to release it early. So whats with all the goddamn complaints?

4117633,0,t3_37t058,gt Are background walls if sprayed with Crimson or Hallow Corruption? Solution invalid for purposes of housing?Considering they would convert Stone Walls to Crimstone  Ebonstone Walls that are identical in both look and function to their natural counterparts I would assume the answer to this is yes since NPCs wont move in if theres Corruption or Crimson nearby. Also you can build in Hallow biomes as far as Im aware.gt How do I make lavafall blocks? Buckets of lava dont work next to the crystal ball.Empty your bucket into a  crevice in the wall make sure its sealed or wont destroy anything valuable nearby and place the Crystal Ball close to the liquid. Alternatively just place a Crystal Ball beside an open pool of lava underground. If done right you can use Glass to create Lavafall Blocks. The same process works with water heres an examplegt Will a Pirate Map ruin spawning if I use it during a Solar Eclipse?Theres no indication on whether or not two events can stack but I would assume the answer to your question is no seeing as both events spawn their own eventexclusive monsters respectively and one is naturally occurring while the other can be summoned. The likelihood of getting both events to happen naturally is close to impossible Id imagine.gt Do Life Fruits spawn in a Hallowed Jungle?Theres no such thing as a Hallowed Jungle so no. As far as I know the Jungle can only be overwritten by Hallow upon the defeat of the Wall of Flesh and then only by Corruption or Crimson biome creep naturally afterwards. There are no plans made evident to players about the inclusion of Hallowed  Corrupt Jungles in the immediate or distant future.,Terraria,crpmwt8,2,t5_2sg5b

Build biggerbettermore creative housing for you andor your NPCs. Prepare your map for Hardmode dig a wide tunnel around your town so corruptionhollow dont take over the biome.

4438168,0,t3_3bw9h1,It looks like youre just using Dart Traps which is probably the slowest of traps really. Id use single or double layered Spear Traps facing down. You can double layer the spears using actuators to put the bottom spears into the background. Id use a bird machine to run the spears instead of a timer.Id also place my water trough in the middle. The Jungle grass needs to spread so the arapaimas will spawn fastest water mobs in the game  quicker farming. You should also get rid of the Ice as with it there you might end up withe a Frost Key Mold instead of a Crimson Key Mold. Also move the crimson where the Ice is.Im not sure if the lava trick works in . so I wont advise using that. Basically you put a row of chests down on the platforms below put  item in each chest and then pour a bucket of lava. In . the lava didnt destroy anything and you got a narrow strip of lava which would increase your farm effectiveness greatly.,Terraria,csq46ox,1,t5_2sg5b

4443145,0,t3_3bxn57,The main problem with Terraria I feel is the early game.  It mostly just consists of mining for minerals to get better tools to get better minerals.  Though as already mentioned it is pretty awesome to find this new item in a chest or come across an enemy for the first time.  Once you begin fighting bosses and get past skeletron most likely the rd boss youll fight however the game gets much better.You then can explore the dungeon full of dangerous monsters and awesome loot you probably have the gear to visit the underworld which you can imagine what would be down there.  You begin to fight these powerful monsters and it feels so satisfying to get a new weapon and suddenly those monsters that gave you hell are just minor annoyances!A great example of this is fighting the first boss for the first time and then fighting it with endgame armor and toptier weapons.  That boss that once took  minutes to take out can be obliterated in under two seconds!  The game is full of TONS of content and was enough to keep me playing for  hours on a single world!One thing that I feel is just amazing is how when you feel like you can take on ANYTHING only to have a certain thing happen that I wont spoil and suddenly that armor made of hellstone might as well be tinfoil.  You feel so weak again only to gain new equipment and find new loot and become a god again!  You look back on how powerful you thought you were before the thing happened and laugh because of how strong you are now.Tldr Early game kinda sucks but if you can push through youre in for one amazing game,Terraria,csqqspc,2,t5_2sg5b

The entrance is a big flamethrowing dragon head. I move around in a UFO by the air and a complex underground rails system me and my friend dug and created. We have built an ocean on the middle surface area of the map in which we constructed a submarine base which purpose is to contain the spread of corruption in that particular area. Does it seem enough building freedom? I didnt even start really.Jumping from these two playing modes is what kept me glued to this game the whole time. I literally CANNOT get bored of the whole game as the two main parts of it are totally different game experiences between themselves and you can switch between them at will while playing.starts building mega towergets boredproceeds to summon  mechanical bosses togethercompletes mega towergets back to pillaging the dungeonEDIT spelling etc.,Terraria,csqvz0c,1,t5_2sg5b

4486632,0,t1_csw5a6g,So you think it would be totally reasonable to respond to someone struggling with the Eye of Cthulhu with go get the last prism and the fight is easy?Hell why not just recommend they go into a multiplayer world and have someone give them a terrarian and full endgame gear? Its a sandbox game thats a totally reasonable strategy to recommend to someone asking how to survive their first night! Theyll survive it for sure with that stuff!Of course not. Going through the game with endgame gear would be incredibly boring and while the game doesnt stop you from doing it thats clearly not the intention and its unlikely that many people would find it very fulfilling.The fact that its a sandbox means there are many possible ways to do it and you can escape the intended order though its worth pointing out that there are a number of gating mechanics that you cant bypass but that doesnt mean there isnt an intended way to come at things or even a range of intended ways that provide the degree of difficulty most players are looking for. They didnt design the game by just throwing everything in a blender  there is a very clear intended progression that will provide a degree of challenge appropriate to most players. Expert mode in particular exists exclusively to make things more difficult  it would be pretty strange for someone to both want to play on expert and to be open to circumventing the gear progression to make it easier wouldnt it?So yes it can be played in any style. But I think he was pretty obviously asking how to beat it without going into another world beating it in nonexpert and coming back with the better gear. And if he was interested in doing that dont you think he would probably have just done it rather than asking for help? Going and getting endgame gear to make a boss easier is not a particularly obscure strategy.gt OP also already has a Nebula Blaze so why the heck not make a Nebula Armor setNebula blaze doesnt require beating the moon lord to craft.,Terraria,csw7bf1,2,t5_2sg5b

4505417,0,t3_3c1tso,Im the kind of guy who only plays Minecraft for the redstone mechanism.  I have been really excited about Terraria having his unique wire system.  All of the outputs are great however Id like to have a better input trigger...  Suggestion   add a x block wire target. It generates an input when being hit. and it can only pulse every secondAs some of you have already noticed all the inputs are pulses. And storing logical circuits like a RS Latch we have to rely on physical mobs from statues and sometimes interactions with actuated blocks. However statues have spawning limits so we cant push this kind of circuitry very far.  In short  The actuated blocks are the stored data and mobs are here to test if theyre are actuated or not which can be slow.  Some people have found a solution using a slope glitch named HOIK to make the best of Terraria Circuitry.  In short Hoiking lets one single mob checking the states of blocks very quickly making calculations way faster than nonHoiking circuits.I have nothing against Hoiking but it feels a little weird to acknowledge that the finest Terrarian circuits are mainly based on a glitch. Its just not comparable with others systems Minecraft has BUDs which isnt as game breakingSuggestion   It would be very convenient to make new wirerelated blocks which can act similarly to diodes.  Normal diode  x furniture that receives a signal in one end and produce a signal in the other end  or  frame later.  Togglable diode  x furniture that acts like a diode but can be switched On or Off by wire or by hand. When Off it cannot produce any wire pulse. This could replace Hoiking in a cleaner way.,Terraria,csyk424,2,t5_2sg5b

4508906,0,t1_csyr3cw,uSethBorder already covered some good points about preference and making the code readable.Especially in a team I imagine theyre aiming to make it easier to read and maintain the code. Performance is critically important as well but for such a large project theyd want to optimize by profiling. At the same time we cant really evaluate the performance here because were looking at the intermediate language output CILMSILIL from the managed assembly represented again as C.When the assembly is executed the IL metadata and references are loaded by the common language runtime CLR and are justintime JIT compiled as needed into the native assembly language for the target machine. As such it is possible to provide environmentspecific optimization at runtime. Checking the ... assembly I see that the JIT optimizer has not been disabled. That said we could instead examine the resulting machine code say on an x machine to see what instructions are generated and go from there. Overall however time will be a major factor.,Terraria,csyzw23,2,t5_2sg5b

4530469,0,t3_3d48jh,first thing is to ensure that the map generator did not fuck up majorly. every day you see posts on this sub showing screenshots where for instance rooms of the jungle temple are misplaced oceans are weird or even missing something is wrong with the dungeon etc... so check if everything looks normal on the big scale.then you probably want to have some special spawns to add more diversity to your world. a good number of sky isles and lakes a couple of big living trees and maybe a pyramid or an enchanted sword shine...and now for the bioms.. after generating you can check if your bioms are all placed nicely side by side with each haveing a decent size. you want to look for forest the default biom which is important too tundra desert jungle and your corruptioncrimson of course. now at this point you can already project what the world might look like after you enable hard mode. have a look at this screenshotnotice the big V in the middle with one side corruption and the other hollow. this is how underground corruptioncrimson and hollow will be spawned after enabling hardmode. so you can already try to choose a map where it is less likely that this V shape will completely overwrite existing biomes.as for containing the two... have a read especially take note of the part where it is explained that destroying altars has a chance to randomly spawn corruptioncrimson tiles in your world which you then have to hunt and remove if you want to keep your world clean.,Terraria,ct1p961,2,t5_2sg5b
4532146,0,t1_ct1njlp,Good idea. I think when you place one monolith and activate it near the pillar it should bring down the shield immediately destroying the monolith in the process and have the pillar leave only half the fragments or slightly less than half? it would have dropped which is just about enough to craft the monolith. Sometimes you might fall short and so have a reason to do the fights again. The monoliths breaking the shields of the pillars is also a pretty nice mechanic that doesnt seem contrived.Or the pillars and their mobs could drop some cool stuff.

4592651,0,t3_3dx788,Yes! Its very possible. Because youre doing a mage playthrough youll have less survivability so make sure you always have a good arena and plenty of potions.As for gear AdamantiteTitanium is the best armor you can get before you kill any of the mechanical bosses. A mana flower is borderline necessary and get a meteor staff ASAP! The staff should be useful through to plantariagolem.If you need it you can make chlorophyte armor before Plantaria. The Specter armor from the dungeon which you can make after you defeat Golem is basically what you use until you can make the lunar stuff.Im not sure what is needed to have the martian probe spawn but the event does happen several good magic weapons can drop from the boss.After killing the lunatic the nebula pillar is what you need to make the new magic weapons and amorSo I guess before you fight the final boss your best weapons will be the Nebula ones and the Martian onesIf anybody else has better information than I do feel free to correct me.

Build autospeed adjustment walk only as fast as you build Timers sized  so a delay can be builtin Summoner weapons with large knockback andor passive effects. Maybe a minion weapon that functions similarly to the Flying Knife Crowdsourced enemy AI for expert mode Minions to build or dig for you. Option to auto repeat Nonauto attack weapons but with notperfectsmall randomizations timing. Wireless transmittersreceivers. Cycling Teleporters Upgrading armor and weapons. Boss drops items to increase the damage for specific item types to the appropriate level for that point in the game. Town Portal. Teleport back to your spawn but be able to return right where you were  time. Better bucket management. Chest transferswap Expertveteran pickaxe items that allow you to replay the game and be limited to mining the appropriate ores at each point in the game but the pickaxe will be fast like an endgame pickaxe.

4621749,0,t1_ctcx600,I felt like defense was the best stat in expert mode at least for myself so I stacked Warding on all of my accessories. CrossStar necklace you craft from Mimics is REALLY useful since it doubles your invincibility time and when combined allows you to also deal more damage that way. You could also try to get Flesh Knuckles from the same enemy that drops Fetid Baghnakhs as it gives a whopping  armor   from warding! Then after those you could use things like a Fire Gauntlet to increase your damage. You could also use the Warrior Emblem if you have room. To get more defense you could wear a Worm Scarf Really good item Shield of Cthulhu and you could even try to farm the Frozen Turtle Shell which is a rare drop but a good item.Potions such as Endurance Thorns Ironskin Regeneration and Lifeforce. For more damage you could also use Wrath and Rage potions and a Flask to increase melee damage. Well fed buff is good to get as well.Once you have all this and Warding on all of them   Turtle Armor it should be fairly easy to just tank Plantera while swinging the weapon.

It can ONLY be found in the Cavern layer which is deeper than Underground the stupid thing about this is that its the only item to do so from a Golden Chest which means you only find it on the parts where the background is slightly different from the Underground one. Even then it only has a . in  chance of being in the chest which is ridiculous.If youre going for Lava Waders dont even bother. The Water Walking Boots have a  in  chance of being in underwater chests which are even more rare than golden ones and the accessory itself is only that useful for mining Hellstone and fighting the Wall of Flesh it isnt worth it to waste hours finding them just to save a couple of minutes.

Theyre pretty easy to spot during the day and generally only appear in the forest biome so you can skip over desert corruption crimson and tundra.  If youre going for pure farming create large worlds since there will usually be more shrines generated.Getting the Arkhalis comes down to luck.

For singleplayer in normal mode not Expert it is a  second wait. If you check the X on the minimap it tells you how many seconds since you died.Try turning frameskip on and off that normally fixes it.

4726208,0,t3_3fnk6m,This list is something I cannot find myself agreeing with. It does not take crowdcontrol into account at all which is most needed as a melee.As much as I love the Possessed Hatchet it sucks as crowd control only being able to hit several enemies if you throw it properly read when you miss your target. This makes it incredibly unreliable against the larger waves of enemies youll be facing in the endgame.The Terra Blade is actually really good against waves being able to pierce large waves of enemies. This makes it fantastic against Solar Eclipses The Martian Madness event and even against the Solar Pillar. The Flairon is fantastic and works incredibly well against most of the pillars. Get a UFO mount and make AFK infinity signs in the air with little to no aiming required. Amusingly also works really well against Fishron himself.The Scourge is rather unreliable. This is probably a personal thing but it rarely makes an impression on me I much prefer the Flairon.The Paladins Hammer is fun but completely useless after you get the Solar Eruption. It gets surpassed in damage and utility light and being able to go through walls.Speaking of which the Solar Eruption is really good. Too good I might say. The damage is insane and its ability to go through walls is really good and allows for easy Moon Lord fights.Also Mark Wahlberg is fantastic. Loved him in Sniper.,Terraria,ctqa1kx,19,t5_2sg5b

4855251,0,t1_cu6i4nk,I liked the Moon Lord fight. At first. There was a build up of tension a feeling of importance with every pillar you defeated pondering what may happen after this. The cryptic messages every time you defeated them. And then you defeat the last one and.... nothing. Nothing happens after this leaving you slightly disappointed. You go back to your house and begin sorting what spoils you earned. And suddenly and flash of light and BOOOOM!!!!!!! A gigantic monster with slimy skin tendrils and more eyes than you can bother to count. Yes! This is what its been leading up to! Hes a tough destructive boss giving you no mercy. Once you somehow finally defeat him he pauses in his weakened state and begins to shake and tremble. He begins to spurt metallic ooze from every limb and stumble. Another flash of light leaves you dazed and the beast has disappeared. It seems he has rewarded you for your skills in battle. Youve done it! Its all over! This is the feeling of fighting the Moon Lord at first. Then you look on the wiki or whatever source to see what youre now missing. And you see things like the Terrarian and Meowmere. You have to fight him again. And again and again farming him as he loses his charm so you can actually complete the game and it leaves you bitter and unsatisfied. The boss itself is a masterpiece a great and epic way to finish the game. And then you realize that this is Terraria where nothing ever ends. He becomes just another thing in the game. I dunno I feel like as great as the Moon Lord is hes foreign to the game feeling out of place. EDIT Also he does feel like an end of game boss in my opinion. The way hes presented and what happens after hes slain. It just feels out of place to me and it doesnt work for Terraria.,Terraria,cu6jh9m,0,t5_2sg5b

5032432,0,t3_3jv8d4,Prehardmode is mostly the same except that the ice and desert biomes are different with different loot and monsters and there is an alternate biome to corruption you can get called crimson. There is a new prehardmode jungle boss called the Queen Bee as well. Whether you get corruption or crimson is determined in the world gen.Before the WoF if you want you can elevate you house or make it more secure etc.  I remember when I first went into hardmode I mined out the area underneath my house because I was worried Clowns would blow it up.After the WoF a biome called Hallow will spawn and another corruptioncrimson will spawn on the opposite side of the world as the Hallow.  Corruptioncrimson also spreads much faster and through sunflowers.  Use the Pwnhammer you get to break the Demon Altars which will spawn new ores. You can make armor and tools that are very helpful for the next step which is the mechanical bosses.  The wiki probably has more information on them.After they are defeated you should head to the underground jungle which now has much harder enemies a new ore called Chlorophyte ore spawns and there is a new boss Plantera.  You summon Plantera by breaking a pink flower called Planteras bulb.  After Plantera is defeated  things are unlocked.  You can now access the Jungle Temple where you can fight the next boss Golem and the normal dungeon now has new monsters which drop new weapons and accessories that are quite useful.In the final room of the jungle temple you can use the Lihzard Power Cells you found in chests on the Altar on the floor which will spawn the boss.  Defeat it to unlock the Ancient Cultists which spawn in front of the dungeon.  Attacking them start the boss fight with the Lunatic Cultist.  After that fight four towers will spawn in your world and you have to go to each one kill the enemies around it and destroy the tower.  Each tower drops a certain type of fragment which is used to craft endgame gear.  Shortly after the Moon Lord spawns which drops Luminite ore which is used to make various things a portal gun and and endgame weapon.,Terraria,cusll29,2,t5_2sg5b

You can magic mirror through it too but the timing is really tight.If you have some time to burn I just posted a working rod of discord afk farm.  I got  out of it so far.Hope this helps just burn all your lunar fragments on moon lord summons and learn the fight.E  Also my first kill I went all out and made endurance potions wrath potions stole ebonstone from another world and built an artificial corrupt fishing spot rage potions lifeforce potions heartreach potions regeneration ironskin food buff and went full tryhard.

When new merchandise came in if the person who generated the labels didnt know what the item was youd get some pretty inaccurate descriptions. We had one older lady otherwise good natured and competent but of the oh I dont understand computers lol persuasion. Other coworkers showed her how to use the label maker often enough that it actually stuck.

Due to the color and the very spread nature of the particles it is also a bit harder to see. There are some places where Starfury cant illuminate such as a ceiling directly above you or a wall to your side.Mounts are a bit easier to control as in easier to direct the light. The several particles travel very close to each other making it a bit easier to see. Although the blueish is not as clear as white it is a bit easier to see than purple.

Expert mode is really only for people that dont think Normal is challenging enough.If you havent actually beaten the game before then dont lock yourself into a playstyle. Keep a summoning stick with you if you have one but use whichever weapons and armor are best that you have available. Theres a reason its considered a Challenge run to do Summons Only its very challenging.Ultimately you need to do whats fun for you. Nothing you do in the game will get you judged by other players because nobody will see what youre doing. The only reason to lock yourself into a strategy or follow a particular playstyle is if you think you will derive enjoyment from it.,Terraria,cwiv9xj,2,t5_2sg5b

The Bees Knees couldnt quite do it for me with the wall of flesh.  Hellwing with explosive arrows finally did the trick.  I must of fought it  or  times before I was finally successful.  I am on softcore but losing all my gold each time I die is rather annoying.I havent beaten any of the mechanical bosses yet but doing much better overall in hardmode.  Bows finally get autofire and the repeaters are pretty cool.

5711124,0,t3_3tb2rd,This will be a great addition to Terraria and will add more ways to build farms.To those that are comparing the conveyor belts to hoiks they are really not comparable. Hoiks are utilized for their signaling speed and the ability to create junction points which in turn allows for the signal paths to be altered based on the inputs. Conveyor Belts dont have those capabilities but will find use elsewhere such as item collection in mob farms  something thats not easily achieved with hoiks particularly when it comes to small items such as coins or hearts.Its the logic gates that will reduce the need for hoik systems and thats a good thing since there is currently a limit on the hoik signaling agents max  dummies and  NPCs.

You think youre a genius by spending your time on the calculator. Stop being a smartass and realise that RNG is totally random. It isnt a .  zeros later chance. It doesnt count up the kills and give you a higher chance of getting one after youve killed a certain amount of mobs. Its totally random for each and every kill. Get your facts straight before commenting and learn how RNG works. I didnt come here to argue with you cause your mind cannot comprehend anything without a theory behind it therefore you pull up retarded numbers and instantly claim its impossible. Your chances are NOT fucking correct. It is always  and I dont care what the chances of that happening are cause it happened. Dont think calculations are everything cause there are no calculations when it comes to the RNG. It picks out a random number. If it matches you get ur item. If it doesnt too bad. RNG can be limited to a certain amount of numbers it can choose from and thats how drop chances are customized. World generation for basically infinite world games like MC are based off of RNG and the amount of numbers it can choose from is limitless.

6318706,0,t3_422xnp,Ive been pretty big into it the last few weeks. I played a little Terraria on PC a few years ago so it was still mostly new to me. Heres what I think.The biggest thing you might feel is youre only given small worlds. That means you tend to get a desert OR snow biome but rarely both due to space constraints. My first worlds Crimson is so small normal Underground monsters spawn in the main chamber. Also keep in mind you only get  characters and  worlds per character. That can feel a little cramped.The next biggest problem is save times. It can sometimes take  minutes or longer to save. This isnt as big a deal sometimes because it seems to autosave if you close the lid but its annoying when Im in the middle of a big build. The controls are sort of all over the place. Some things in the menus have shortcut buttons others require you to use touch. The decisions about which buttons to use seem to have been decided by throwing darts at a dartboard. You use the same button for unequip move from chest to inventory and throw away depending on which screen youre on. And theres no button for move to chest from inventory for whatever reason. Since activating items like chests use the same buttons as grappling you can get in some bad situations when trying to flee monsters. You get used to some of this over time but I think in a welldesigned game you dont get used to the controls.But a lot of these problems dont matter so much if this game scratches your itch. This is a good enough experience for playing minute chunks of Terraria on my lunch breaks. I spend more time with my DS than I do at my PC so its worth the tradeoffs.,Terraria,cz7v7mo,2,t5_2sg5b

6416934,0,t1_czj00kf,Well based on what the original image shows... doorstopper incoming!The buildings feature lots of wideslatted wood and roughlooking shingles so to match that I would use Boreal Wood for the exterior walls and Mudstone Brick for the roofs. Pearlwood Fences seem to be the best match for the source fences.The insides are hard to see but they appear to be somewhat unrefined with an exposedstructural feel to them. I would make the interior walls resemble a framework of wood and ebonwood walls with something roughlooking like stucco or raw marble walls filling the gaps. Small amounts of boreal wood and mudstone walls to match the outside is a possibility. Maybe experiment with planked walls and green slab walls to give the structure more weight and consider using wood or ebonwood fences for windows instead of glass.Paint is your friend! The color scheme of the original is warm with greenish undertones which means playing with brown and nondeep orangetogreen paints until you get something that looks natural. Do this on a small scale first to get an idea of what colors play nicely together.You dont have to follow my reasoning to the letter here. If you think of a block or wall that would work alongside these try it! You can even substitute one element for another entirely in one small part of the build  this keeps the whole thing from looking homogeneous and makes the remote unimportant areas more interesting.Also try building the structures more than one block thick on the outside. This makes the textures of the exterior blocks more noticeable gives you room to sneak different blocks in to connect with the interior patterns and allows you to vary the thickness of structures to create a sort of hierarchy between the buildings or even different areas of the same building.,Terraria,czj1gvn,2,t5_2sg5b

I meanwhile have to fall back on the shotgun or a melee weapon I have no bonuses for and am more fragile. As such he outdamages me at close range nearly matches me at long range and is tougher. I got to use a Scourge of the Corrupter and it felt like a infiniteammo uzi that fires a hybrid of Chlorphyte and Crystal bullets while also benefiting from Flasks.

6527226,0,t3_450agc,Im actually trying out a summoner run right now so I hope this advice helps. As I saw from one of your comments below youre using the Crimson Rod Yrimirstyle which is the same I tried. I beat Skeletron using all the hornets I could get along with a twolayer platform arena with a campfire on it. Since minion AI...Isnt really the best the fight is mostly about running and bouncing around like crazy until the hands are down then standing still so the cloud can work. Your baby slime rule might actually make it easier than it was for me though since it tends to hit pretty often...If youre still having problems a heart lantern wouldnt hurt. For Wall of Flesh hes actually not that hard it just takes a LONG bridge through the Underworld. Like  blocks as opposed to . For Summons I used a slime two hornets and two imps until all of the Hungry were down then I switched out the imps for more hornets. Maybe Im horribly mistaken but I feel like they just have a higher DPS...If Im wrong someone please tell me I hate spreading misinformation. Again I hope this helps!

6586493,0,t1_czzvu96,HEY!  After being inspired by the bunny counter I saw here I built this... I just found your hoiktronics guide and I built a copy of it.  This has also inspired me to try to think up a way of building a binary calculator addition only to start in ..  I cant quite think of a way to do this though.  I know that with the next update well have a very wide array of compact tools to work with in the form of logic gates that will allow us to build more complex things like multifunctional ALUs Arithmetic Logic Units.  I was trying to either prove to myself that it is possible to build something like this in . but I have not proven in possible or impossible yet.  Any ideas on how this might be possible?  The fundamental hurdle is that there is nothign that can conditionally inhibit a signal being sent.  Or nothing to read the state of a bit.,Terraria,d00li72,1,t5_2sg5b

Make sure you bring speed potions and any accessory that increases speed because the WOF is much quicker in expert mode.

6974225,0,t3_4b5osy, Renaming a world I understand though it is possible in external applications. Granted it should be possible in some way through the application. Changing the difficulty? Ehhh. If you take an existing world with existing buildings full of loot whats the point of going to expert? The point of expert is to give Terraria Veterans a challenge and it is pretty challenging. If youre not hardcore awesome or extremely patient even with lategame gear youre gonna get facerolled by the unlikeliest of enemies if you arent prepared. Thats why Expert requires an entirely new world it isnt just some a little more damage its a lot more. Slimes are still a threat well past hardmode for example. Expert is an experience that you need to start fresh in so you can learn and adapt to face greater dangers.Basically if you dont get gud youre gonna have a bad time in Expert mode and if you did that with your favorite world it would probably frustrate you to no end.Purification however is a mite different. See purification of the world is a core mechanic of the game. No you didnt know and though you prolly would have inferred what you needed to know from the Guide and learned to quarantine and clean it the game could be a little less opaque about some mechanics. However the fact still remains that a method of purifying the whole world at once will likely never happen since one of your goals is to purify the whole of your world. Whats that? You screwed up? Better make a new world and try again or bust out that pick and clentaminator and get to work saving your world. I mean its your job right?Edit WordingAnd finally grass not growing where a fence is placed would honestly look really gross in my opinion.

7246448,0,t3_4eoapn,Yeah Ive had similar experiences...I think most of it has to do with memory management.

7266176,0,t1_d240uat,The thing with the Cultist is that hes interesting as a fight because hes the same size as your character. Hes not this towering beast hulking construct or abomination of nature hes a guy who got a hold of some crazy magic and has plans of summoning something bigger.In terms of the actual difficulty of the fight its rather tame. But considering whats still to come ie the Lunar Events if he were any tougher the entire final sequence would be frustrating especially with Moon Lords easykill attacks. Its why I can understand people wanting to farm the Moon Lord  as challenging as the fight may be getting to the fight is tedious eats into resources and can easily be cut short because of one missed attack. Learning the patterns requires a lot of time and preparation so for people who just want the Moon Lords drops its significantly easier if more tedious to build the AntiDeath Box and cheese until everything stinks.,Terraria,d2443fl,2,t5_2sg5b

7402006,0,t3_4gp2l9,Early game summoners struggle greatly. Getting a slime staff is almost certainly not going to happen unless you grind at a statue for hours. This means that as a pure summoner your first weapon will likely be the imp staff which is made from hellstone bars. This can be done fairly early with the reaver shark but you will have to do a lot of defenseless mining.If thats not your thing Id suggest starting your pure playthrough here. Wall of flesh will go down with just imps and after that the class will become immensely more powerful as you progress.

7469547,0,t3_4hmj3m,This was a while ago so excuse me if I forget some of these item names since I havent played in about half a year and Im still waiting for patch . to hit consoles. Personally I beat him with full Spectre set Spectre Staff Scourge of the Corrupter Ice Wings Magic Handcuffs Warrior Emblem Sorcerer Emblem and Frostspark Shoes four of them Warding one Menacing. Scourge of the Corrupter whenever I had over  HP or was out of mana Spectre Staff  whenever I had less than  HP and leftover mana. For the Scourge of the Corrupter it doesnt really matter where you aim but for the Spectre Staff you have to aim at Dukes face because its homing projectiles are slower and you dont want to lose your chance at healing. I can also confirm that Vampires Knives Turtle Armor similar equips swap the sorcerer one for Ninja Tabisgear and Possessed Hatchet work fine as well since my friend managed to solo Duke like that. I dont think Duke becomes enraged when away from the Ocean on console yet because my strategy just consisted of dragging Duke from left ocean to  of the a map then back to ocean and rinse and repeat until he was dead. I got to say that its harder than Im making it out to be but with enough practice you will get the hang of it I got a feel for it after  deaths. Just make sure there are no obstacles in the way like a living tree and the real practice comes down to using the Ninja gear to dash when youre going to turn back or if youre a mage with no Ninja gear just praying he doesnt hit you like a truck because thatd the best chance Duke has of getting on you and hitting you twice in a row for over  of your HP. The teleporting staff can help you escape some tough situations like being in between sharknadoes but I rarely used it because on console its slower to drag the cursor to the location you wish to blink to. If you beat Duke once and youre lucky enough to score the mage tome then you can solo him even without Scourge by getting hit proccing magic cuffs hitting him with the new mage spell for tons of damage and heals and it homes faster than any other spell rinse and repeat. If you beat Duke and dont score the mage tome but still score the flail its pretty much the same situation. Either one of those two items will make quick work of Duke for your next attempts. ,Terraria,d2r8pyt,2,t5_2sg5b

7471561,0,t1_d2rfysu,gt whats up with the  vs.  trapsTheres a very specific number of traps needed to complete a firing loop for each different activation agents movement speed. Of course because it takes more or less time to get between each plate so the darts are space further apart or closer together.The awkward unintuitive part at least for me is that the direction the activation wave travels relative to the direction of firing makes a small difference to the dart spacing too  opening up a little bit of a gap in the pattern that needs a number of extra traps when firing with the activation wave.I tried to explain it in my original old rapid fire dart trap video  Video designs defunct since ...Also yes any separate rapid engine could be substituted in for the player hoik if turned on quickly after the last plate of the run.,Terraria,d2rgzrh,3,t5_2sg5b

Since you dont have an infinite flight mount one you can get in the Martian Invasion good ol Gravitation Potions are ideal for this since you can cover a lot of range.Even if you dont find one you can make one.  Go to the Wizard and buy an Ice Rod.  You can use it to shoot a temporary block to stand on.  With a little practice you can even use it to climb up in the sky.  Once youre high enough you can build off of the ice block before it melts and make a platform.If you want to stay on the ground hanging around the far end of the jungle if its far enough will have a chance to attract a probe in thanks to the jungles elevated spawn rate.,Terraria,d30or16,4,t5_2sg5b

Something that you might well be very proud of will maybe get a thousand views depending on your subscribers. But a minutelong piece of nonsense that you recorded rendered and uploaded in an hour? Fucking gangbuster of a video easily gets a million views in a week nets you a load of subscribers and possibly also locates your missing parents or family pet delete as necessaryBuild pictures are fantastic and always worth a look but people are going to share and upvote the silly post what points out the tedium of fishing because its funny.

8236363,0,t3_4s78ab,What weapons are you using? Regardless of armor type Id suggest using a Phoenix Blaster or Clockwork Assault Rifle at the very least until you can upgrade to weapons of your choice. They do fair damage at a long range with decent knockback which is perfect for starting out hardmode. A Spider Staff buddy is useful as well. You can also try farming for an Amarok in the snow biome. Its a pretty decent yoyo. The Ice Sickle is a great option too but its much rarer.If you dont manage to get an Ice Sickle Id also suggest having a titanium sword or phasesaber as a backup weapon for things that get too close such as bats.Another option for an upgrade to phoenixassault is the Uzi from the jungle. It can be very scary and Id take a strong polearm along with your original gun and spider minion but the Uzi is good enough to carry you through the mech bosses with crystal bullets.Spells are also good options although I dont play using them as much so I cant give you specifics.If you made a wall of flesh path out of stone high enough up in the underworld you can also sometimes get the biome specific mimics to spawn. It may take a while to kill or find them if they spawn at all but their drops are also very powerful for hardmode.,Terraria,d573n1r,2,t5_2sg5b

8344864,0,t3_4tuqxh,Im assuming you mean hardmode and not the difficulty level. Yes it is a very good idea to stockpile crates prehardmode as it saves both time and corruptioncrimson doesnt spread as much since destroying an altar necessary to spawn ores underground spawns a block of corruptioncrimson randomly. Ive found that around  golden crates  iron and  wooden crates gives you a comfortable start into hardmode and should allow you to craft a full set of titaniumadamantite armor and some tools. Make sure you have a good fishing rod angler equipment the quests give very good rewards and crate potions. This will make sure that you get as many crates as possible. Also make sure that your fishing spot has over  tiles of water as any less will give you a penalty on your fishing power. Good luck!,Terraria,d5knu5c,5,t5_2sg5b

8373891,0,t3_4ub3j1,Ill try not to spoil anything as I personally think that ruins the exploration aspect which is what I found most enjoyable on my first playthrough though Ill drop stuff in spoilers if you want to knowThe first thing to do is get  HP. Once you have  HP things will start happening theyll happen randomly at certain points of the daynight cycle youll see what I mean. Spoilers Specifically the Eye of Cthulhu boss will have a  chance of spawning each night. Defeating this gives you access to a new NPC and better weaponry. Youll also be invaded by Goblins as well which will allow you to find the Goblin underground who is very important for upgrading and combining accessories.After that its time to clear the Crimson. Youve probably noticed the huge cavernous entrance in the Crimson that leads underground to a large room that protudes outwards This is where you need to go and face the boss of the Crimson by doing a couple of things down there. Highlight for precise instructionss After you defeat the boss that occurs at  HP the NPC Dyrad will spawn and sell Purification Powder. You can use this to turn Crimstone Blocks into Stone Blocks which will allow you to mine to the Crimson Hearts in the Crimson you can use explosives from the Demolitionist too. Destroying  of these with a hammer or explosives will spawn the Brain of Cthulhu boss which is an important progression milestone as defeating it gives you access to a new pickaxe which allows you to mine more things and new armour which lets you fight tougher enemies.After doing this youll be further along the equipment and tool progression line meaning youll be able to go to more places that were difficult to go to before.,Terraria,d5oabcl,3,t5_2sg5b

I would rather have no idea when a game is coming out for most of its development in order for it to be complete when it does finally release than a half baked game because fans pushed for an earlier release.

8676341,0,t1_d6q52t9,Heres the layout for a random logic that fires one signal on true and another on false The blue logic gate is a faulty logic gate which is how the random firing is done. Read up on Faulty Logic Gate Lamps to better understand that The rest of the system allows a signal to be sent even when the faulty logic gate doesnt send a signal. Currently the faulty logic gate is setup to have a  chance of firing. The XOR on the left makes sure that when the faulty logic gate doesnt send a signal another signal will be sent. The AND gate in the middle increments the logic gate step What I like to call it so that if the faulty logic gate does fire and change the bulb on the bottom the bulb on the top will change on the same step and not cause the XOR gate to fire.Sorry if thats a little confusing. It took me awhile to figure out how to do this and for some time I thought it wasnt even possible.,Terraria,d6q5zec,4,t5_2sg5b

8692979,0,t1_d6s8m2l,Yeah man i know what . added. I followed every update explanation from Whitney and poured over every patch notes to see what is added. As i said the only MAJOR difference is at end game where the PC version has the moon lord stuff. The extra things your talking about werent hugely game changing unless your a crazy Terraria nerd who makes insane castles with collections of eveything in the game they were more QoL adjustments like NPCs helping defend variants of weapons furniture blocks inteactions etcThe fact that you say it added a LOT more then quantify it with a fair number of x y and z items shows that it was mostly variants and filler. The fundamental experience isnt vastly different if hes already played it thought on console. The only MAJOR difference is the moon lord stuff.

9227479,0,t3_56qzaa,I dont think theres really a standardized tier list for weapons but Id like to give my opinion on weapons for the Mage class for end game.Razorblade Typhoon Lunar Flare and Last Prism are the best end game Magic weapons in my opinion. Razorblade Typhoon is the best crowd control Magic spell IMO. It shoots out massive  high velocity projectiles for  mana pierces enemies bounces off walls homes in on enemies so you dont really have to aim and it homes really quickly. Its basically massive AoE that doesnt take much skill to use at all. Good in close quarters good in open space. Nebula Arcanum kinda comes as a close nd but the projectile travels really slowly and doesnt really work that well against monsters that move quickly especially mobs that spawn in Lunar Events. It also has an insanely high mana cost of  mana per projectile.Lunar Flare is also really good at taking care of mobs due to the explosion upon contact piercing enemies the issue is that it drains your mana more quickly than Razorblade Typhoon. The reason why you keep this item around is because it goes through wallsblocks and its point and click. Its literally a much better version of Blizzard Staff. It also has really high DPS so its good vs bosses. Also has the utility factor of scouting dark underground areas since it provides light.Last Prism is the best single target DPS for Mages. Also pierces and is solid for mobbing. Drains your mana extremely quickly however.,Terraria,d8lnfmk,5,t5_2sg5b

9547695,0,t3_5bmaoa,if you are trained and skilled in both building an arena and in dodging  prehardmode becomes pretty much trivial even on expert. On my current hardcore expert playthrough I never encountered any problem with bosses once I got a full set of meteor armor  space gun since the armor gives the gun infinite ammo and the shield of Cthulhu for dodging. With a platform grappling hook arena Skeletron the Queen Bee and the Eye of Cthulhu are all quite easy. I only ever had trouble with Skeletron and that was when my keys were partially stuck. So from my experience I can say that what matters most in both preWoF and hardmodes boss fights is how good your arena is and if you can dodge. Equipment is less of a concern since getting a meteor set will carry you through prehardmode and the hardmode armor and weapons tend to last a while too.,Terraria,d9py81p,1,t5_2sg5b

You could of course always farm for more heart statues and use a  second timer to reduce the delay between hearts by s CD is s now.  I used the Solar Eruption to attack through the walls which  protected me from the deathlasers which are the most damaging attacks. Used full tankbeetlearmor Celestial Stone Celestial Shell Obsidian Shield Power glove and Warrior emblem to become very tanky and still put out damage. In the first stage there is barely and danger since you have a wall against the only really threatened Attack. Get all  eyes to very low HP then pop out the HeadEye first since it usually has a longer closedphase. The second stage was purely me moving slightly left and right between the  statues to evade some attacks but mostly tanking everything and relying on dealing more damage than I take.

Believe there is some timing involved in how soon you can pickup the liquid from the right... have to wait for it all to fully split.

Not entirely sure how it works since i always play multiplayer and my friends are more familiar with the mechanics. You need full molten armor if you arent REALLY good at dodging. This can be mined by breaking obsidian and making an obsidian skull to mine hellstone. In expert worlds the WoF speeds up to insane speed so if you dont have an arena you are actually fucked. Instead of bee armor your friend should get meteorite since bee really isnt that great after the grenades were nerfed?. Overall congrats on making it that far and if your friend really wants to go summons you will need to go into the sand biome and kill the sand golems. I probably couldve just linked the wiki but whatever. Also you should not go anywhere near the waffle so use a minishark with meteor bullets.TLDR Get molten armor and meteor build long platform in hell get molten pickaxes too. space gun and minishark with meteor bullets are also good. Also could i get a list of what items you have equipped?Edit Sand golem only spawns hardmode during sandstorm.

10233269,0,t3_5mig13,Some stuff to add...maybeIf you didnt use potions at all in prehardmode begin using them cause youll need them. The classics like Regeneration Ironskin Speed etc. can really make a difference towards the end of a boss fight especially in expert mode. You can also catch Prismite in Hallow fishing ponds for the really good Lifeforce potions. And a Crystal Serpent for Mage Users. Underground Hallow probably has some Crystal Shards waiting to be collected for a Phasesaber.Keep an eye out for the Wizard especially if youre in the mage class. Make an above ground Mushroom biome for your Truffle. If youre in desperate need of money look for the Tortured Soul in Hell and use Purification Powder on him to turn him into the Tax Collector. Hes not that important though you can go the entire game without him.Consider making a farm for Life Fruits which spawn in the jungle and only add  to your maximum health which can be a very tedious and long process without a farm. Also consider making an Ocean Farm for Pirate Maps and other general goodies. Good for money making later too. If you do get a Pirate Map it might be easiest to begin with Pirate Invasions not only to get the Pirate NPC but also some decent weapons and accessories and furniture if that matters to you.I would suggest battling either the Twins or the Destroyer I personally had a lot of trouble with the Destroyer first once youre ready to fight a Mechanical Boss. Definitely not Skeletron Prime first.,Terraria,dc3zyeh,28,t5_2sg5b
10234507,0,t3_5mijdb,This looks amazing! Especially for PreSkeletron this is great!If I had to critique I would say that the walls being uniform with no variation looks kinda boring after a while. Maybe slab or whatever its called walls and glass? Or maybe even dungeon walls after you fight Skeletron. Cant think of any good blocks right now.Edit I mean in addition to the wall variation you have right now.,Terraria,dc44zua,2,t5_2sg5b

Weak last phase no defense options after arms are gone Bomb and Laser are too slow to harm.With that said Destroyer is still the weakest as you can kite him by building an air platform.,Terraria,dc8sqou,2,t5_2sg5b

It should even cut itself off once the pit at the end of the flow fills to a certain point.  It will dump the excess into the underworld and even refill the chamber under the volcano perpetually.BTW the fire and explosion effects in the city are activated as lava reaches their portion of the city.

10837595,0,t1_ddxsvoh,Im sorry for the tooltip but if youre really willing to uninstall it based around  item than you dont deserve it to be fixed. The reason it was so smug as all of you put it is because I had just watched a popular youtuber shred the boss that i spent weeks on with it and because I was predicting some kind of people like this.

11530945,0,t3_64hdwf,Id say go for expert mode.  In my opinion the ranger class is tied for the easiest class next to melee.  Prehardmode should be pretty simple.  Use a bow with flaming arrows for the EoC then a bow with jesters for the EoW.  Queen Bee shouldnt be too hard then you can use the Bees Knees for Skeletron and make the necro armor.  The Wall of Flesh shouldnt be too difficult either just make sure you have plenty of movement speed and use the Phoenix Blaster or Molten Fury.  The Clockwork AR is a really good weapon to start hardmode with if youre a ranger.  I would probably farm the WoF until you get a ranger emblem as well.  Once you get to hardmode you can craft Frost Armor then use the Daedalus Stormbow with Holy Arrows to easily kill the Destroyer.  With the Souls of Might you can make the Megashark then use that to beat the Twins and SP.  Ill let you figure the rest out from there because there are lots of different weapon options as you get further into hardmode.,Terraria,dg319ec,1,t5_2sg5b

Simply place them down forget about them and hit him with your Terra Blade. Your turtle armor and warding will most likely keep you alive but you should try and keep your mind on dodging his attacks as they can do a lot of damage. Over time however he gets more and more mobile the more damage he takes. And he starts attacking more frequently the more damage he takes.

Lowest tier cheap but is only able to get bad  alright reforges for accessories level  enchants.  Normal tier can get any for normal items for accessories level  enchants.

But as reforging is Ive watched Bands of regen take out  gold to try and go for the reforge I need for my set to work in expert.  If the games money drops need to be rebalanced around a new reforge Id be more than happy to get less money with a more consistent value.Angler works like Dungeon Defenders guy and has tokens to buy rewards Stolen from SilverBird on discordPotions being charges up to  instead of stacks so glass can be used for my fancy furniture instead of me eating it,Terraria,dgtnsai,243,t5_2sg5b
