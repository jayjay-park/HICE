6586254,0,t1_czx3q9l,gtWhen did she one shot Hrist? gtIt comes across as the organization not really knowing shit because Neko already took out their previous strongest Valkyrie and Onodera seems just as capable as both of them. Maybe they dont count either of them? Or its just going by fantasy logic and the power levels of your characters can be tweaked at any time even if it doesnt make a lot of sense.It was stated and shown that Mako was upgraded. Unlike Neko she cannot be hung by touching her harness and she has far better endurance. She doesnt lose her memories when she overexerts and can use  forms of magic. The organisation experiment extensively on the magic users to guage their power levels. Logically Mako should be superior to Neko since the former is essentially a prototype. And then you have Hrist who the scientist confirmed to be stronger Mako after assessing ther readings when she awoke. It is just weird that Neko can do that Onodera another Valkeyrie who casually man handled Hrist.,GokukokuNoBrynhildr,d00km6p,1,t5_31rfc
