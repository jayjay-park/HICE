33660,0,t1_cei8she,well thats actually a common misconception. Yes they know how the match will end who will win and some of the major stunts or spots within a match. But other than that its improvisation and its up to the two guys in the ring to decide which move to pull off based on the crowds reaction pacing storytelling etc. Even just the average bump hurts a lot its a mat yes but its still just some thin wood covered in canvas. Just go to your floor and just fall flat on your back. Then do it about  or  times in a row. yah not so easy.and thats not including falling from a great height or onto something not meant to be thereWrestlers such as Owen Hart died because of accidents He fell from the rafters after a botched entrance using a zipline but some get paralyzed Droz in the documentary Beyond the Mat linked in the comments and also there has to be taken into account head trauma. Back in the day when youd see a guy hit the head with a chair that was legit so nowadays thats not allowed due to what we know about concussions. Its assumed massive head trauma was a part in Wreslter Chris Benoits murder suicided as hed been hit in the head so many times and so one day he snapped. Also of note is that the blood is real. Wreslters have razor hidden and when they want to bleed they or the other guy blades across their forehead when the camera isnt looking and everyone is distracted.  Check this video out In it you can see Eddie Guererro who is now dead largely because of heart problems due to taking steroids get hit then he hides his face to  blade himself then the camera cuts away and the next you see him hes bleeding. no fake blood there all real. ,MorbidReality,cei9i2x,19,t5_2tz1e

Which is why I suggested some resources for improving our communication. Saying essentially the same thing after Ive noted much of it is out of context and irrelevant to what I had initially wrote isnt really engaging in conversation its being a broken record. I wont continue the initial conversation if I think Im merely going to be discussing with a broken record  its not a good use of my time. I had hoped wed be able to move past that but Im coming to realize that wont be possible.If youre looking to troll me Im not really invested enough emotionally for it to work  though I suspect thats not really your agenda. It looked like it at first given how completely divorced from reality your response was but trolls usually would have given up by now. From the sounds of it though this is a conversation youve had a variety of places saying much the same thing  so you have an axe to grind. So instead of actually seeing what Ive written youre replying to preconceived ideas about what I might think and what you assume Im saying without actually reading and internalizing my points.

149786,1,t1_cev882v,You have a very narrowminded approach to seeing the world. The world is a complex and at times evil place. There are situations that arise that leave communities severely handicapped. Such places like Somalia. There are these small coastal towns run by warlords and gang leaders. You grow up in this town with no job no money no hope of leaving. The only possible way to earn money is through helping the gangs. You do it because its normal. Id be willing to bet that you yourself would be a pirate had you been born in these areas. Remember morals are a societal fabrication. They are not constant nor concrete. They vary from place to place. A place may not have the same morals that you do. Therefore we cannot so quickly blame criminals around the world like you have. Sure they have done wrong. Sure they can be punished. But you also need to look to the context of their situation to realize why they did what they did.

215300,0,t1_cf0dfn5,Still waiting.gtPraising wounded soldiers who fight in the countrys wars is an old pastime stretching back to tribal warfare and the ancient Greeks. It is mostly an attempt to gin up support for state violence.gtSo when Obama paid tribute to our warriors who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free he was not being genuine. Does having  U.S. troops in Germany really have anything to do with keeping us free? Or is it what policymakers in their less public moments have said NATO is all about namely ensuring the U.S. maintains dominance over the European continent? Are the approximately  U.S. troops in Japan really there to keep Americans free? Or are they there as in Europe to maintain Washingtons dominance and more lately contain a rising China? Did troops really invade Iraq in  to secure the freedom of Americans? Isnt it true that the presence of U.S. troops in the Middle East motivated alQaeda to attack us on  and thus made us less secure and less free?gtAnd if the troops in Afghanistan are there to protect freedom all the way back here in America why does it look like well be pulling out with none of our major objectives accomplished and the Taliban as strong as ever? Might Americans have been just as free if we pulled out in  when Obama took office and when Corey was nearly killed? Wouldnt Afghanistan be in approximately the same position it is now with a weak government that survives on foreign aid and systemic corruption and a Taliban insurgency that despite the vaunted surge looks like it can break up the country?gtBy  Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had privately admitted the war in Vietnam was unwinnable but necessary in order to maintain American credibility and prestige. The war in Afghanistan is very much the same. Soldiers sent to fight and die in Afghanistan are sent for the international reputations of politicians in Washington to save face to prove to the world that America will use force even in lost wars.gtThe greatest threat to Americans freedom doesnt come from Germany or Japan or Iraq or Afghanistan. It comes from Washington. Thats why people in the Founding generation like James Madison said A standing military force with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty. He also warned posterity that No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare. Thomas Jefferson described standing armies as a menace to the liberties of the people.Source,MorbidReality,cf2yttq,1,t5_2tz1e

Before you know it you cant function in mainstream society you can move upwardforward and you certainly arent able to access drug treatments that work.  So you self medicate.  And when you lose your home and your job its easier to panhandle to buy a  and a hit of your drug of choice than it is to wait for some day labor job that might net you  dollars after  hours of time put into it.  And no ones going to give you a job and now your health is going and you might as well just numb yourself.  Thats the cycle of drug addiction. Drugs are bad.  Most people understand that there is little positive value to society when drugs are sold on the street grown and distributed by gangs and kingpins. And I think few of us could say weve never sought out a drink alcohol is a drug remember or a cigarette or a friends leftover vicodin or even something more sinister in times we wanted to numb pain or feel loose or get through the next day... But its assholes who fail to see that some people arent able to bounce back from a bad decision  that its not just always one individuals choice but a slew of factors.,MorbidReality,cfbl3oi,16,t5_2tz1e

My sister is in a far less extreme situation. Perhaps its because I have no soul and there has been no physical fighting but I have been able to let her choose her own destiny. Have you heard of codependence? Perhaps it describes some of the victims. Maybe you and I cant really understand it because were different from the victims. I am emotionally detached and sometimes feel like I have no metaphorical soul so I can never understand a lot of things people do for love or whatever else. And thats okay with me since I still have some empathy for physical feelings like pain and some of the more basic feelings like guilt and so am not a psychopath.

It was not his child. They were divorced when the child was born. Dont you think the childs fathers family had some interest in and feelings about this? Bob had no real claim to that child at all. I understand why he took custody of his with Paula because of her drug use and other issues but taking a child that was not his was a bastard acthe had been extremely jealous of Hutchence and Paula had even felt he only wanted to punish him and her.

We are a primitive nearly tribal society that still holds to the same mechanics that primitive cultures used to maintain social stability. We feel shame and fear for our actions as a way of making sure that we will do what the groups accepts because it used to mean survival. Alone you would die in the cold and harsh world. But that world has since been mastered yet our culture cant keep up with our economy and technology. There is no need for fear shame there is no need for social judgement and thus there is no need for privacy in a world free of these archaisms.And yes I am quite sane and thanks to my sanity I can see that such concept is impossible to implement and hard to even propose at this time  because our society is primitive and quite frankly completely mad.,MorbidReality,cgv2tlt,0,t5_2tz1e

The descriptions of the desperate scramble for the stairs that led to the portside decks of the ship as she listed heavily starboard and of the chaotic terrifying moments as people missed their splitsecond window and were trapped in the suddenly submerged starboard cabins staircases and bars are some of the most distressing passages Ive ever read.    gtThe scenes of loss and bedlam defied coherent description by the survivors who witnessed them. On Deck  two women who had reached the staircase lost their grip and fell fatally against a wall. Others had already been badly injured and some were lying apparently dead. Emotions among those unable to climb varied widely with some people screaming incoherently others seemingly listless and confused and still others rational selfcontained and brave. One of the survivors a young man who had been trying to guide his parents and his girlfriend to safety got separated from them in the chaos while gaining the stairs. When he looked back to find them it was obvious that they would be incapable of negotiating the open space across which increasing numbers of people were fatally sliding. His parents shouted at him to save himself as did his girlfriend. It was practical advice. There was no time to linger over the decision. He turned and continued on alone.,MorbidReality,chj6h6a,5,t5_2tz1e

And itll be part of your medical records forever. Should a woman diagnosed with PPDPPP ever try to get divorced who do you think is going to end with custody? The father? Or the mentally ill mother? But the biggest danger is really just not having any form of support system to notice the little things that change in your behavior like serious lability crying  everything freaking out and yelling at your small kids and endless sadness. And too many people just dont want to get involved but will be happy to judge your actions later!It just really makes me sad whenever I see a case like the one here in the news because it means that that poor woman didnt really have anyone looking out for her and didnt think that she needed helpor didnt know that she could get help for how she was feelingand her kids died due to societal neglect. Not enough funding for mental health services not enough time with your doctor so that they can ask basic questions like Are you okay? Are you sleeping? Are you eating? Getting any exercise? Sad a lot? So that they can let women who are feeling that way know that they arent alone and can get some chemical and therapeutic help.  ,MorbidReality,chorvnq,7,t5_2tz1e

To say that If you do X you just shouldnt have kids... seems a bit overreaching.To be clear Im not excusing what happened here. A child is dead. No one will ever look at that man the same nor will he ever see himself the same way. There is no excuse. He killed his child.What Id like for people to consider is that by making this man out to be an other who was naturally defective as a father you give credence to the notion that This couldnt happen to me.

If a human is put in a bad situation authorities get called in right away in most cases. If a person is found chained up against their will somewhere and someone calls it in someone steps in. An animal can spend its entire life chained to a tree in the backyard and if it has sufficient shelter food and water no one is brought to justice and the animal is not saved.An animal being killed or abused is given little to no justice in our current system especially compared to if a human is abused or killed.Animals are also put down when they are completely healthy just because no one will take charge of them. Euthanasia in cases of illness is a blessing for them euthanasia for being born is far from being treated better than humans.Also the US is known for being one of the only civilized countries who still perform declawings on cats which is seen as unnecessary mutilation and is illegal in nearly every other civilized place as well as some that are considered barbaric in other terms.The US is a bad example of animals being treated well.

It means that they wont be condemned by a jury publicly. Individuals shouldnt have the power to take away a persons life if anyone should have that power it is a court. And the court should not exercise that power either if it is avoidable. For all we know the shooter was never forced to do anything at gunpoint and he made it all up. Im not saying thats what I think happened but the fact that we cant know means that we shouldnt punish the rapist with anything as final as death. If years down the road evidence is found that a person sentenced to death was innocent theres no way to free them from the grave.

For some of us me included losing our phone in a fire would be a mild annoyance that would be resolved as soon as I could get down to the store and pick up a new one.  For others especially those without insurance it could mean a massive financial burden that may not be possible losing precious photos of family that arent saved elsewhere and an overall stressful situation.

And it makes it seem like something like this could have been planned for quite some time now using the terrorist excuse to bomb without much real repercussion in order to control a region deemed valuable. Its funny cause the US was in that same position. When the US was doing it I was appalled but not as much as I should have been because the US is my home country which is ridiculous. Seeing Israel do it its easier to think that no matter who is doing the bombing for no matter what reason its wrong even if it is to fight terrorists. Yeah terrorists sucks and fighting them is hard but fuck these civilians live is rough enough as it is. When youre killing more civilians than actual bad guys your end game becomes very questionable. Find a better way to fight terrorists or it just looks like youre not really fighting to fight the terrorists but rather for control over a region and its people. I realize the easiest way to control a region is to bomb it to hell but the amount of disregard for civilian life is so horrific and scary. With all the advances humankind has achieved the one thing that seems to be falling in the opposite direction or at least is just stagnant is human beings disregard for other human life.

When the researchers placed a mother monkey doll in the cage with a new set of babies the babies clung to the doll and survived but they were psychologically damaged and never learned to integrate with normal monkeys even after reaching adulthood.You think you have control over yourself because you have grown up in certain conditions and you live more or less in harmony with your cultural environment.  But if you had been abused and neglected had your heart repeatedly broken and your dreams and aspirations repeatedly crushed since you were a baby and if you saw no way out of that predicament and you had decades of anger and heartache and resentment built up in layers inside of you you would be a fucking mess.  And so would I.  And no matter how hard we tried to control ourselves we would find this psychological damage breaking through and spilling over into our actions and our lives...Even the thought that you have control over yourself is what youve been taught to think.  Its a Western idea.  If you had been raised in a village in India or some tribe in the Amazon you would have a different philosophy right now.So if you have a good life then count your lucky stars.

1704021,0,t1_cjtpoep,Obviously not OP. But also disabled.Can we not talk about magic curing? Its not useful and I guarantee you weve all answered it five millions time before and quite often were tired of it. It can make people feel like their bodies are not good enough for the normal population. Quite often we work very hard able bodied and not to be okay and to be at peace with our bodies. And so much of body imagine disabled person or not is tied to culture and the social aspects of being in this world. If we could remove those negative aspects from a disabled persons life that particularly pertains to their disability then it would be a much better world.I also dislike the idea of positive outlook like it implies that the situation is shitty and we must be better and inspirational to be okay with it or happy about it or whatever it is. I get it a lot of aspects of disability CAN be negative. But what makes it so much harder to deal with sometimes is how people act about it and how we are treated and what we end up being barred from doing even though were perfectly capable given some allowances to do things a bit differently.You know what being disabled has given me that? Im a great problem solver if I can do it independantly I do. But I also know when to ask for help if Im truly stuck. I know my body really well so if something is up I know pretty quickly be it related or not to my disability. I have a fantastic deaf dog because I saw a dog that needed a home and some allowances not a dog to be pitied because of it  and I knew I was the person to do it for him. Hes my rock.There are negatives yes. But I love the positives its given me and its made me who I am.So no more magic cure talk please. Were tired of talking about it. For those who dont want it because we dont want it. And for those that do because it reminds them again that they arent happy with their body.Lets talk about more constructive things.,MorbidReality,cjtycil,9,t5_2tz1e
1705947,0,t3_2dusbc,I honestly think the problem is the victims Im including the family friends of victims also aka whos on the prosecuting side get too greedy for lack of a better word.  What I mean is his friend who was with him should not have tried to say he was completely innocentrunning awayshot in the back etc and his family should not have said that he was a gentle giant or something similar. Both should only say as little as possible and the family should not be saying stuff that is untrue unless they didnt know about his criminal and thuggish ways though I doubt that.  I understand that emotions are running high and theyre not going to be  logical with their thoughts but they need to consult a decent lawyer before doingsaying anything.Same with the Jameis Winston case the accuser MAY have been raped by him but her testimony such as her too drunk to remember but was barely drunk when tested only hurt her credibility.  Im not trying to shame her but my best guess if she was actually raped was she started embellishing thinking that itll help get him convicted or make it worse since if we assume she was raped by him shed obviously feel some ill will towards him but instead it backfired on her.Hell I know a friend who was in a very minor accident that was considered both parties fault but the other person was the only one with damage to their car.  They must have felt that this meant they couldnt be at fault so they told their insurance that but the police report said differently.  So this person had to pay an additional fine or would have went to jail for lying on their own official accident report they had to turn in.  Like I said accept the facts and dont get greedy.,MorbidReality,cju73dz,1,t5_2tz1e

2037859,0,t1_ckyu0ip,gtIve been out of therapy for a few years now but Im likely gonna be on medication forever. Which is annoying but thats kind of what chronic illnesses doare. I have some chronic physical illnesses too and will likely be on meds for those forever so its pretty much the same deal. Usually managed I have to take care of myself occasionally one the other or all of them will flare up due to stressthe weatherno fucking reason and it will suck but they will pass. Which I found was a helpful way to think of them for me.. Hey at least you can get the medication you need! It sucks that you need it but it could be worse I suppose. Thats how I usually try to think of it. It helps a little. gtI hope your back recovers well and that you keep the job. It sounds like you really do put everyone else first and care so much for them. The drugs are pretty understandable if youre hurting so much finding ways to not hurt is a good thing. Even if theyre not the best coping mechanisms you need them at least for now. I hope when youre ready you can find some that are healthier but work as well but getting yourself stable is the main thing. I hope my back recovers too. Ive had knee pain my entire life. Its due to extremely tight hamstrings. My back has been getting worse and worse every year. Im  now and there are days when it hurts just to sit up or move around. Unfortunately I havent had insurance in years and so Ive just dealt with the pain and bought pain pills when needed. I work construction and its all I can do to go to work each day and I come home and usually go to bed to sore and tired to do anything. The crash has made my back even worse. I was supposed to go to work today. When I woke up I was bent over kind of hunched and couldnt straighten up. Hopefully they figure something out. I hate going to the doctor though. They always do nothing. Take a few x rays and tell me some bull shit about how its part of life. I dont believe constant pain is apart of life. I realize having random pains is but this isnt that. Ive pretty much just given up which makes wanting to stay alive even harder. I feel like if I could just get a handle on my pain and my add I could live a normal or at least semi normal life. gtI got access to my therapy through my province because apparently I was fucked up enough that they decided to need treatment more than they needed cash. Canada doesnt actually pay for all healthcare just most of it. I hope you can see someone a good therapist can really change everything. I think Im going to get insurance soon. Hopefully I can find a good therapist. I realize doctors and therapists are completely different but Ive just had it with doctors so much I tend to think of it as all the same. I just want to be pain free and feel normal. Why is that so difficult? ,MorbidReality,ckyuv8o,3,t5_2tz1e

2050539,0,t1_cl0e9hr,As Ive said depression skews perspective. Thats the entire point of the disease and diagnosis. My friends and I understand this on our good days and on our bad days we try to remember it. The difference between lifelong depression and more temporary depression is how long the diagnosis lasts. It doesnt change the fact that your perspective is skewed and it doesnt make life less worth living. Again Im not talking as someone who wants everyone to live for the sake of everyone living after all overpopulation is a real problem Im talking as someone whos lived with depression for about a decade and learned that there was more to life than being depressed after one or two of those years.And again as Ive already said inoperable cancer is not what I meant to refer to. I believe I also expanded that to include other deadly physical ailments to which we have no treatment. But in case it was not clear I will say that I see a large difference between choosing to die because death is nearly inevitable in the current situation e.g. inoperable cancer holocaust victims victims of accidents put into nearvegetable states etc. and choosing to die because depression gender dysphoria etc. make life seem not worth living.,MorbidReality,cl0gw0f,4,t5_2tz1e

2377978,0,t1_cm4w4gu,Sure. the phrase an eye for an eye originated on Babylonian law to define the extent that a person could seek vengeful retribution against one who had wronged him. Ghandi is usually credited with the adage an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind. Hes essentially condemning the idea of seeking equal vengeance. Similarly it emphasizes his teachings of forgiveness and pacifism. The phrase becomes a commentary on the human condition that we tend to act in our own self interest when you consider that all people will at some point in life take an eye from someone else. If we get caught up in seeking retribution from all those who wrong us we lose sight of the good things in life thereby leaving the whole world blind.,MorbidReality,cm5mkl5,4,t5_2tz1e

I thought to myself lady if the doctors think she has a severe mental illness they might know better than you. Its such a shame that her family has essentially turned their backs on her and let her fend for herself on the streets. And its disgusting that these entertainment media shows are using her antics for ratings instead of actually having some sort of common decency for a very mentally ill young woman.

2513914,0,t1_cmmp7o3,Like I said the problem is that he committed one crime a pretty fucking big one the biggest of them all to get to the lesser crime. He planned the first one to get to the second so to me that should most certainly count as an aggravating factor in the commission of the first as it would in almost any other circumstance.If you drink and drive thats a misdemeanor in most situations. If you dont drink and run over somebody that may or may not be a crime. But if you drink and drive and run over somebody it automatically becomes a crime regardless of the circumstances of the actual accident because you were already in commission of a crime drinking and driving and the sentencing is dramatically increased versus just being negligent because of the willful commission of a crime that lead to the accident. Its a misdemeanor contributing dramatically to the sentencing of a felony.In the same way I would certainly say that killing people with the intention of raping them after the fact is a worse crime than killing or raping somebody. Yes theres less suffering to the victim because they didnt endure both crimes but the fact remains that the perpetrator committed one major crime solely for the purpose of getting to another crime. And its not as if we dont have a long and varied history of punishing people for crimes based on societal standards rather than solely based on the suffering of the victims.,MorbidReality,cmmpgp1,10,t5_2tz1e

2604556,0,t1_cmyjhxu,gthow do you think this massive muslim immigration affects your country? Its quite a complicated question. I think Sweden is doing good if you take into account how big the immigration is although some people would disagree. It gets problematic when immigrants make their own societies and dont even bother learning the language. A few years ago on TV one immigrant who lived in an area like this was quoted saying I love it here it feels like at home or anywhere else in the Middle East. While I think it is great for her that she feels at home I dont think it is a very positive thing in the long run if people come here and never integrate.I didnt really get thisgtIs it possible that swedish culture is deviating from the aspects that got they where they are possibly fulminating in community cohesion problems or do you see more positive reflections of this in societyYou wrote it well and I know what the words mean but I guess my English isnt as good as I want it to be.gthe was very negative about muslim immigration in scandinavian countries. He said there are muslim neighborhoods in Sweden where gays and jews are not allowed resulting in intolerance and violence and also mentioned a wave of rapes in the country. How do you feel about that as a swede?It is terrible. There are definitely areas with a lot of antisemitism and Homophobia. There have been attacks on synagogues and Jews arent really safe in the bad areas. Reported rape is the highest in the world too. It is horrible and something needs to be done yet every political party dont want to bring it up. The ones that do are called racists.I definitely think that irresponsible immigration goes against everything that made Sweden what it is. The ghettos just get bigger and exclusive to anyone who is not a foreigner. Swedes are just scared of being racist so they dont want to talk of the issues when there clearly are some but it isnt as bad as the rest of the world makes it out to be.,MorbidReality,cmyjwpx,6,t5_2tz1e

The long response time coupled with the poor communication between WMATA and the fire brigade could have been devastating had the fire and smoke been uncontrolled or if something worse had happened in the system. WMATA as it is already runs on a deficit and while a number of safety features are in place in the stations there are always mechanical issues on the lines and many of the employees are improperly trained on what to do in an emergency.

His narcissism was the single and most obvious problem and as far as I can tell from his manifesto he was born with it.But I think that we dont know if he was really born that way as children are wont to do or if his home life reinforced such narcissism until it became a fixture of his character. Its probably possible to implicate his father at least to a degree for failing to teach his son properly growing up. See my other comments in this thread if you are curious about how grotesque a person Elliot Rodger grew up to be.Edit lets read the article cynically. His father pleads ignorance and how all this came as a shock to everyone and how Elliot couldnt hurt a flea and also implies that Elliot was mentally ill. Its a fairly safe play if you want to try to avoid culpability. I know from reading his manifesto that he spoke about his crazy desires near the end of his life to his family. They watched his youtube videos even probably called the police on him. But even before that the family put him into therapy because of his obvious problems.

According to the wikipedia entry the vintage WWII Canadair Sabre failed to achieve lift off as it taxied down the runway directly opposite the ice cream parlour. It crashed through a chain link fence barrelled across Freeport Blvd. and plowed directly into Farrells which was packed with families who had come to watch the airshow at the Sacramento Executive Airport celebrate birthdays little league games etc. Twentytwo people lost their lives and  more were injured. One child who survived lost  family members. The pilot Richard Bingham who had logged only four hours of total flying time in the Sabre survived. It was the worst US airplane related accident involving people on the ground for almost  years. Because of this accident the FAA altered rules about flying exmilitary jets in heavily populated areas. Edit An article about the survivors  years later and the dedication of a memorial plaque and rose garden on the site.Edit  ucypressgreen provided this link to another site with more firsthand witness accounts From the checksix.com site an arial view of the path of the Sabre into the ice cream parlour showing the distance the plane traveled before impact as well as the memorial as it stands today ,MorbidReality,cpy6ecr,10,t5_2tz1e

After years of agony due to the sexual trauma he suffered the boy in their most famous pedophiliaencouraging book ended up murdering the nanny who sexually abused him and then killed himself.I read something that River said that stuck with me that he started having sex at three years old I believe that was the age.

Your entire premise makes no sense. In one breath you talk about comparing pedophilia to homosexuality which cannot be changed via therapy then in the next breath you profess concern for pedophiles seeking therapy to reconcile their urges.

3856762,0,t3_34jtvh,I can sort of see why they would dilute the breast milk. It happens a lot more than you think more so with formula though. Low income parents will add a little extra water to each bottle to make the formula or in this case breast milk last longer. Idk whose breast milk the baby was getting because if it wasnt the mothers they could have been getting donations and just didnt have enough. If it was the mothers she was probably pumping and her milk  supply wasnt adequate enough so they watered it down to make it last longer. Theres a lot of pressure on new moms to exclusively breastfeed and are led to believe mothers that use formula are lazy so that might have been a factor was to why they didnt get government assistance to get formula. They usually dont realize how dangerous diluting either breastmilkformula can be but if they dont have money for formula they feel like they dont have any choice. I worked at a grocery store a few years ago and they had all the baby formula locked up because people would steal it so often.

It humbles me so that I no longer rage against myself for not having achieved all that I think I should have achieved by now. Since in the face of senseless chaos I see the noble ideals we adhere to and espouse at every turn are just a cheap veneer hiding barbarism lust greed hate systemic violence which can only be brought about by deepseated fear and the sort of massscale human suffering that is brought about by apathy and the belief that everyone who contributes to it is just doing my job.I come here to see the bottom of the barrel the lowest point a human being is capable of going.

Furthermore the article doesnt speak of any no man zone between Gaza amp Israel it says crossing into a security zone and according to witnesses at least  yards from the base. The logical assumption would be that the IDF considers a certain area around their military bases a security zone. gt The girl dropped her backpack at the gate which seemed like a terrorist bombing attempt.AFTER THEY SHOT HER SEVERAL TIMES OH WOW THAT SURE IS SUSPICIOUS GODDAMN  YEAR OLD TERRORISTS ALWAYS DROPPING THEIR SCHOOLBAGS WHEN YOU SHOOT THEM A LITTLEgt When the IDF stormed outside to catch the girl they were under fire from Palestinian snipers.They didnt leave the base to catch her they went out to make sure shes dead. Regarding the snipers until you provide a source for this Ill go with you just made that up.gt She was used most probabely by Hammas lets be real here there is not a single reason the poor girl wouldve ended up in an Israeli post unless forced to.Wow just wow. This would be hilarious if it wasnt so sad. It would be all over Israeli news if there had been even the slightest evidence she had anything to do with Hamas. She wasnt in the base she was at least hundred yards away. What you call facts is mostly madeup BS. Youre doing a terrible job trying to make a case for the IDF here. But hey I sure am glad they sent out a squad to make sure she was dead. Weve got another evil terrorist high five! Congratulations. You truly disgust me.,MorbidReality,crgy2y6,4,t5_2tz1e

4143511,0,t1_crsj7qv,I wondered about this too and I read another article that had more information Ill see if I can find it again. Basically they had a small amount of DNA from the rape but it was too small to test with the technology they had  years ago. The rapist kidnapped raped and slit the throat of a second girl in the late s and that time he was caught and convicted. He only served  years but they had his DNA in whatever database exists. So a few years ago they ran the DNA from the original rape again with the better technology we have now that can get matches from tiny amounts of DNA and they were able to match that DNA with his DNA in the database from his arrest.ETA Here it is. Speaking of morbid I find it kind of fucked up that they downgraded his charges from attempted murder to rape and kidnapping  no charge for cutting her throat?  and then the jury was apparently like okay he kidnapped her but were not convinced he raped her. Like what maybe he kidnapped her and then they had consensual sex before he cut her throat?,MorbidReality,crskt1r,11,t5_2tz1e

4302063,0,t3_3a9jss,Here is an example of an officer is a similar scenario that from the officers perspective is much more dangerous which is handled properly where in both dispatch was correct in their choice to dispatch and officer and the officers response was at all times appropriate to the scenario.  I post this now because I think its important to have some kind of a relative understanding of how the situation could have been handled.  From the article you can read the dispatchers conversation with the caller.  gtTHE CALLER Hi I just got out of church and I was driving down Michigan Streetand I dont know if its illegal but it looks like maybe hes not but looks like theguy has got a a gun strapped to his right leg on the outside of his pants.gtTHE DISPATCHER Okay hes got it in a holster?gtTHE CALLER Yeah.THE DISPATCHER Okay its not illegal to open carry.gtTHE CALLER Oh god kind of alarming.gtTHE DISPATCHER Well youll probably be seeing more and more of it since all the school shootings and stuff people are exercising their open carry laws. gtTHE CALLER All right. Its just kind of scary because hes wearing camouflage and and do you have to have a license or?gtTHE DISPATCHER Well gtTHE CALLER Just asking.gtTHE DISPATCHER To have a handgun you have to have a a weapons permit yeah.gtTHE CALLER Right. Because it is it has to be a handgun because its gtTHE DISPATCHER Right.gtTHE CALLER But you can even carry a rifle down the street?gtTHE DISPATCHER Well brandishing a rifle and open carrying a handgun in a holster is two different things.gtTHE CALLER Okay.gtTHE DISPATCHER Okay.gtTHE CALLER It just seemed alarming to me.gtTHE DISPATCHER Okay. Where was this on Michigan Street?gtTHE CALLER  block of Michigan.THE DISPATCHER Uhhuh and the person was in all camouflage?gtTHE CALLER The shirt it looked like a Columbia jacket but its green.gtTHE DISPATCHER Okay.gtTHE CALLER But the pants were camouflage and the holster is clearly on the outside of his pants on his right leg.gtTHE DISPATCHER Okay. Which way was he walking?gtTHE CALLER He was walking up towards higher numbers.gtTHE DISPATCHER Okay but he wasnt threatening anybody? gtTHE CALLER No he was by himself.What it seems like is the dispatcher got a call from someone who was concerned and dispatched an officer to let the guy know that he was alarming people which honestly is fine there is nothing really wrong at all with that.  The whole idea that the fact he was wearing all camo changed the situation from a legal one to an illegal one is a ludicrous interpretation from the logs it seems more likely the dispatcher was asking so that they could give the officer some means of identifying them.  The officers response is where things start to get dumb  In part because he didnt fully understand what he was meant to be doing there.  Dispatchs instructions weregt  and  check the  block of Michigan Northeast for a suspicious person. Caller saw an unknown male wearing a jacket and camouflage pants appears to have a a handgun in a leg holster. He was last seen walking eastbound on Michigan Thats not very clear as far as instructions go.  That combined with some serious short comings in the officers training seem to have given rise to this situation.  He seems to have felt as if first the words suspicious where synonymous with probable cause and as a result treated the individual as an armed perpetrator rather than a legally armed individual.  Regardless of how you feel about gun laws the law does say that what he was doing was legal.   gtPLAINTIFF Lawful possession of a handgun is not a reason to cite me or arrest me or detain me Officer.gtOFFICER MOE Yes it is until I figure out what is going on.It seems pretty clear the officer doesnt understand why dispatch has sent him here and as a result his handling of the situation was a mess.  He violated someones civil rights by detaining them without cause and when another officer arrived on the scene he uncuffed the individual and afterward wrote to Officer Moes commander suggesting he receive addition training on open carry issues.  In this case it is the officer at fault and everyone including his fellow officers seem to have seen that fact.  Im not really sure where the case is legally but dismissing it after the officer clearly mishandled the situation to the extent of performing a false arrest which is pretty clearly defined as police misconduct doesnt seem right.   ,MorbidReality,csakezp,1,t5_2tz1e

4432188,0,t1_cspca4w,Im not so sure post partum depression is a good enough explanation for why a woman would plan to murder her two sons. This was not a freak incident or a suicide attempt she went out two days before she killed her  year old and bought a large hunting knife and duct tape. On the day of the murder she told her husband she was taking her two boys to see their grandmother in the nursing home. She then stopped her car on the side of the road slit her  year old sons throat and killed him then did the same to her  year old and left him for dead. She slit her own throat in a barn but not before writing a note from an attacker claiming to have robbed her car and murdered her two kids. She maintained this lie after being caught by the police. If she genuinely was psychotic she would have believed her delusions and therefore would not have felt the need to lie to the police and forge a document that served to free her of any responsibility. This level of premeditation is not normally what one would see in postpartum depression cases. I know its horrible to think that a mother could do this knowingly to her children but thats exactly what this woman did and you do a disservice to people who actually suffer with mental illness by tying her in with them. The level of premeditation also means this wasnt psychosis either as psychotic people arent generally capable of plotting events well in advance. ,MorbidReality,cspd6j0,7,t5_2tz1e

4459157,0,t1_cssqngg,Im happy they found such a good treatment for you. Wish you well!With this girl Im not so sure whether curing some chemical imbalance will be enough though.All her memories are probably those of abuse first by her parents then when she was different because of that by her peers and teachers and then by probably mostly well meaning but in the end helpless doctors.Such abuse will obviously lead to some measurable differences in how the brain works  neurons to produce or cut off some chemicals can be disturbed by more than oxygen levels.However curing such behaviors by changing this balance towards normal will still not remove her memories her lack of normal social experiences and according knowhow and so on.I even believe that some of those behaviors are actually perfectly normal  kind of like instincts which will make you stay away from trouble isolate you in case an infection is the reason for you being different make you try to do something more worthwhile make you defend yourself against oppressors and so on.Trying to cure the symptoms like that will accordingly not always lead to healing though in lucky cases it can break a vicious cycle just to dependence on medicine. And it can remove perfectly natural defenses which might make abuse even easier against her or others in similar situations.And I really hate how anything concerning the head is stigmatised as incurable and a threat  which is one more reason why I like your success story.I think a lot more would be treatable if mental illness wasnt stigmatised as far worse than physical ailments with the affected being not only treated differently during such times but also when they act perfectly normal which makes healing very difficult.,MorbidReality,cssra73,1,t5_2tz1e

In college a lot of people try it but most dont develop a problem. I see it as a novelty drug not that special.

5080852,0,t1_cuyf9p9,gtI wish you the best of luck in murdering every man and woman wanted for murder dude. SeriouslyNah. Not my problem not my fight.Gang wars are bad for business which is why they eventually fizzle and burn out.  Id like to think that at least in many parts of the US we have a culture that respects the rule of law. For the most part when someone is murdered here vigilante justice doesnt run rampant in the streets.  In other countries this is not the case and I think theres good justification for vigilantes to handle the situation effectively. Having indiscriminate predators roam the streets unrestricted is bad for society. If the government is unable or unwilling to maintain order and serve justice for the good of society then the people must. I applaud them for their efforts.,MorbidReality,cuyfokw,1,t5_2tz1e

5089367,0,t1_cuv2yzt,Thats really interesting to think about. Even for people without mental illness I wonder how often plastic surgery truly does what its supposed to do for the individual  which is boost confidence and help them lead a happier life.I do not have any known mental illness aside from bouts of diagnosed depression but Ive certainly had a poor body image for as long as I remember and I have had some plastic surgery. I was  am not happy with the results even still about two years postop. I even went back for additional lipo in one arm. I still want to have a revision of my entire procedure and I have a mental list of all the work Id love to have done if I ever had the money. No matter what I always find something about my body Im unhappy with. I can see how someone with true body dismorphia or a mental illness of some kind could be driven insane after several operations and in their opinion no good results  whether its due to a poorly skilled surgeon or completely psychological for the patient.My surgery was a bit different. I had an upper arm lift after massive weight loss. I had this idea that if I put all this hard work into my body and lost over  lbs I would look fantastic! Slim healthy. I was  when I lost it so I never imagined Id have parts of my body that had sagging skin as if I were  years old. I drank so much water cut almost all sugar moisturized exfoliated and dry brushed my entire body exercised and lifted heavy lost at a fairly slow pace took almost  years. I felt like I did everything right but in the end genetics as far as skin elasticity goes just werent on my side. I was obese for too long and people in my family tend to have very thin and not very firm skin.So when I looked into the arm lift I got false hope again. I could show off the slim toned arms I had worked so hard on without all the hanging extra skin. I could stop wearing jackets and long sleeves in the summer. After the surgery and the swelling went down my arms looked nothing like I imagined they would. I was at a pretty healthy weight s at  yet my arms still looked so... mishapen. Blobs of fat hung around the backs of my elbows. And when I lifted my arms I still had plenty of bat wings left. The disclaimers of course said I may not be happy with the results and additional procedures may be necessary to achieve satisfaction. I dont know if my surgeon purposely left this loose broken down fat so I would return for more in the future or if he truly felt like he removed enough for me to look contoured and proportionate.Anyway I never thought about killing my surgeon. I have a poor body image and I know that. Im nearly  and it may take  more years for me to stop constantly finding things about my body to hate. Its a shame there was no way this surgeon or the practice could have the foresight that the patient was mentally unstable and therefore not a good candidtate for the surgeries.,MorbidReality,cuzglzy,1,t5_2tz1e

5323492,0,t3_3noob5,OP as sorry as I feel about your loss this was a morbidly beautiful read. Your friend penned down her feelings clearly and cogently...I know those moments where suicide isnt seen as a frantic thought of despair but a completely rational path to take. You just......calmly measure all your worth in life and arrive at the conclusion that dying is the best option right now one with the least sorrow. Ive faced this during my teenage years because I have never seen death as something negative its just a part of life for me and I believe so even today.This post is an amazing example of how suicidal people arent always clearly mentally unstable or depressed or anything they are often normal people who just have suicide as a very real possibility at the back of their minds which surfaces sometimes and they manage to deal with it mostly except for that one time when they can not. I can totally feel your friends logical conclusion to suicide while being happy and involved with people outwardly. Being around the thought of death for so long makes you immune to the shock value of a possible death and you see it as just another solution...if it gives you any closure OP I reckon that your friend was well sure and happy about what she was about to do before she did it. I do not encourage suicide but I find it difficult to not respect a persons calm and wellthought decision to end hisher life after trying many possible solutions.,MorbidReality,cvs4z9q,2,t5_2tz1e

5654878,1,t1_cwy0r6x,Well that was rude and unexpected. I was asking a question first of all. Under certain circumstances the communal ties are much stronger such as among parents of children attending the same school. What I was referring to was the fact that these women were on a boat with the poor woman who died assumed strangers prior to the trip and they took over and cared for the children. Should that happen now would people come together like that and just take over or would they pass off the children to authorities? I say I dont feel that sense of community because I dont and you tell me to stfu. I didnt do anything wrong to anyone and yet you hate people like me. Simply because I dont feel that this would happen. In my neighborhood there would be precisely one person who would take my kids into their home if something were to happen in my home and that is because that person is a police officer and by taking them in he is doing what he is supposed to do as a cop. Would he take them in for a few days or a week until arrangements can be made for my kids? No. Ive been living next to this guy for  years and he still wouldnt do that. I really do hope to all things that I am wrong but I cant change how I feel without a reason to change how I feel. And if you have that sense of community thats awesome and I hope to have that one day. ,MorbidReality,cwy1jwt,1,t5_2tz1e

I dont think the drinking age should be brought down from  which means the alternative would be to raise the age for joining the military. Some people need those three years in the military though for financial purposes or otherwise so that also seems like it would screw over more people than it helps... Which means the further alternative is that what? We let only those who are under  and veterans drink? Thats idiotic deciding to risk your life is YOUR decision and it doesnt make you more mature than someone who pursues another legitimate career in or out of college.

6397145,0,t1_czgnfk5,I usually get downvoted into oblivion when I say this but in a modern capitalistic society you cant do that.For one its unenforceable.  You are never going to be able to get people to actually comply.  Secondly who gets to choose who can breed the dogs?  Are we going to say only commercial breeders commonly called puppy mills are able to do it?  A lot of people would be really pissed at that.  We could go the opposite and ban commercial breeding but you will never meet the market demand for dogs with home breeders.Even with in home breeders there is a tendency to classify some people as back yard breeders.  The legitimate breeders are the sometimes a bit crazy people who prance their dogs in front of judges.  They are supposed to weed out the undesirable traits in the breed but if anything the net effect has been to create overly inbred dogs riddled with recessive genetic problems.    Im honestly not sure what is worse the back yard breeder or the breeders who created things like the pug or american bulldog.The problem is we live in a rich country where people can buy things on demand.  Its great in a lot of ways but its also creates issues like this.  People are free to go out and buy a dog because its a free country.  However a lot of people are morons who dont follow through on their responsibilities.  That creates problems. There simply is no easy fix here.,MorbidReality,czgsfot,77,t5_2tz1e

A ton of these crimes arent murder but fit a guideline to where the person has to go to a prison with murderers. Maybe the murderers are in a lower level prison maybe the money amount was high enough to get them max. My uncle was put away in a max for selling drugs for the third time during his life. Shitty thing to do but he never committed a violent crime. It wasnt something terribly dangerous like meth or heroin. It was weed but third strike is the third strike. Doesnt matter that the first strike happened when he was  and the third when he was . And relationship aside I dont feel he should have been forced into this just like I dont feel that people with mental illness who murder others should be.One of the people murdered in a cell didnt listen to an officer while the other one got solitary for attacking someone. The fuck? Literally not listening to an officer can mean sleeping when you arent allowed in some prisons or keeping food you dont want to eat right now. And thats not even counting the fact that around  out of every  of these people are likely innocent. People dont deserve to be in a room so small only one person can stand at a time. Your personal feelings may argue against that but if you believe  of them deserve better than that then you need to understand that personal feelings of anger and resentment dont have a stance. Theres righteous anger yes but this practice is making it worse.

Out of all of the articles Ive read since I viewed this post this one was the worst. I just couldnt get past the part where theyre describing how much of a bright light that little girl was. Im desensitized to so many things courtesy of the internet and cynicism but when it comes to child abuse I simply cannot fathom how anyone could hurt a child much less strangle and dismember them. I dont understand how someone could be so sociopathic that they could bring grave harm to a defenseless child. Its times like these that I am ashamed to be human and share in the same species as people like him.The sad part about this is that there are Austin Siggs out there everywhere. There have been so many unsolved child murders in the worlds history that Im sure theres a decent percentage of these cases have been perpetuated by wastes of good carbon and oxygen like him. This wasnt the first nor the last and unfortunately for us all it probably happens on a daily basis.

8646462,0,t1_d6lrfou,Woah  woah  woah. You cant just say poverty  drug use because it doesnt. I guarantee you that drug usage between white people generally richer and black people generally poorer are about equal. This is after  all the statistic your side uses when talking about how the higher incriminating rates of black people in drug crimes are not justified. Besides I dont think you understood what I was trying to say. Im saying there is not a clear line between people affected by the war on drugs and crimes like the above rape murder assault etc which fall under violent crime. Im saying that the massively increased rates of black people committing these crimes cant just be explained away by the war on drugs. Look Im not saying that poverty and single  parent households are not the causes for the increased crime. If we were debating a solution to the problem we would probably talk about that more. But Im talking about how you dont even want to admit that black people commit higher rates of crime or understand why people get tired of reading headlines including the words murder or rape and almost being able to guarantee that the suspect will be black. What kind of effect do you think it has when everytime people read articles like this its always some young black dudes attacking some white person? Do you think they will honestly care what the root causes of the issue are? Do you think the victims or the victimsfamilies will care? Its like trying to tell a WW vet that the German people are really very nice and there were a lot of factors leading to the events of  through .

Its a social network of families friends and acquaintances.

9522368,0,t1_d9jost2,Your examples are of other people who should have received the death penalty as well and it doesnt hold up as reasoning for why those with less efficient counsel shouldnt receive it either. That appears to be your first point. Regarding your second point an inmate being removed from death row is not considered a wrongful conviction unless freed entirely it is closer to a wrongful sentence buy then again were dealing with a political issue which means many of them may have had their sentences commuted to life or similar solely based on the political beliefs of the presiding authority.In short you really have made a terrible case for elimination of the death penalty. You want to know a good reason for keeping the death penalty beyond the very good justifications of deterrence and justice and even vengeance which the law prescribes as due to the victims when considering sentencing but using different wording? When a murderer is presented his charge the possible plea bargain available depends on two primary factors strength of the evidence and the charge the prosecutor has decided to go to trial with. If a prosecutor is able to start with a death sentence charge he is able to offer life as an alternative if he has any doubt about gaining conviction or of the family wants it. If he has to start with a life sentence charge any plea bargain will drop that and possibly allow a remorseless murderer to get out and live his life again. That is a tragedy in itself and in another state without Patrick Sykes confession it may well have happened and another child or more may have been brutally attacked. Where is the value in the lives of potential victims are we only concerned about how valuable the life of a predator is? Last thing antideath penalty proponents love to cite the logical fallacy of the wrongfully convicted man who becomes an innocent victim of the death penalty. Oh if only but one innocent life is taken it isnt worth it! Bullshit. That reasoning can be used to do away with all penalties entirely. The remedy isnt to abolish the penalty the remedy is to strengthen the requirements necessary to apply the death penalty. The argument that the death penalty simply must be abolished for this reason is silly and I find it hard to believe that even those who use this argument truly believe in it and are just trying to say something with pathos to sway the listener and forward the ridiculous idea that all life simply must be preserved at any cost even if it means loss of life as a result make that statement somehow not twist your brain into knots if you can. ,MorbidReality,d9mu10l,5,t5_2tz1e

9832074,0,t1_daoy78m,Youll find many foreigners have less of an issue with the idea of people owning guns but in fact completely disagree with the way the process is managed as incidents like this dont cause people to have their guns taken away when there are clearly signs of irresponsibility. Youre completely right the guy who owns the gun is irresponsible.The fact of the matter is that the owner of the gun in question has all the following evidence against him as a not good owner of a gun Left his gun out by mistake resulting in the death of a young girl dropped a gun on the floor which resulting in it going off and also hitting someone previously. One incident I think most people could rack up to an accident but given the timescales listed in the article and that these are the  incidents we know about there may be other unreported ones that most reasonable people would consider that irresponsible when I have friends or family visit I generally do a check around my home to make sure its clean and presentable if not even owning a gun means I can take the  minutes out of my day to just do that when theres no danger its reasonable that if I did own a gun that knowing how dangerous it could be that if I know a child is coming to my home that I would ensure everythings safe for them. To further add to this one habit I have developed for many years is asking myselfphone Keys walletEvery time I leave home I check for all of those things. I cant remember the last time I forgot any of them because I developed a good habit. It appears this irresponsible gun owner doesnt have good habits because he doesnt think about possible consequences of leaving his gun out when he has kids grandkids etc.Accidents have two results in people eg. having a crash in your car you learn from the mistake and are more cautious in the future you dont learn from the mistake and continue to act irresponsibly. This guy should not own guns so Im in complete agreement there. However many of us foreigners have little in the way of issue with responsible people enjoying a hobby responsibly just that the way its all managed and administered needs a lot more policies and processes in place. ,MorbidReality,dap52uv,27,t5_2tz1e

A parent can tell a kid a million times thoroughly explain every danger and that still wont prevent them from doing that same thing. Not  anyway. Ive explained the dangers of a multitude of situations to my children but every now and then one kid will inevitably do something dangerous.

For the most part they went one of two ways  the caller was desperate to get rid of the account or the caller was desperate to keep it forever. I once spoke with a heartbroken mother whose son had passed away. Apparently Dad called that very morning and canceled the sons line. The notation for that interaction described the man as distraught and becoming increasingly angry so the agent waived the termination fee and cancelled the line. Mom always called her son on her way home from work and after he passed she continued to do so to hear his voice on the voicemail greeting and have a conversation with him. On this day she was met with a number changedisconnect message. I cried with her for the next  minutes and for weeks after. It was devastating.
