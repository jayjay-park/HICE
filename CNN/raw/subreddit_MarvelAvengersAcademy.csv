6743169,0,t1_d0gstc0,If Loki is in Lady Loki form it would have to flip a switch that allowed him to date the male characters if it was removed it would go back to default to the females.

6849804,0,t3_49kzdc,Speaking of Wiki related things.  Do you need the link to my Imgur account?  I had provided it to Qwald to get images up for all the characters.    That seems to have fallen a bit behind now.  Id like to get some of the recently added characters up with their images .  ,MarvelAvengersAcademy,d0sqdv8,1,t5_3cbi3
6853982,0,t1_d0sskj3,Thats a really great idea. Were going to run out of stickies. XDThough I feel theres still a benefit to vetting people to edit in that it spreads the work around of putting the info actually into the wiki. Such a dedicated thread would give an easier venue to see what new people want to add though.,MarvelAvengersAcademy,d0t7gqx,1,t5_3cbi3

6906530,0,t3_4a8bhl,Reminder for myselfQ How do I get more textbooks?A The trick to getting more textbooks is knowing that they always show up in at least one mission any time you need some. So save up a bunch of completed missions including one with textbooks. Finish the textbook mission see what pops up. If its a short one then do it. If not trash it then finish another mission and see what pops up. Etc.This technique works pretty well for other nonParticle item drops as well.,MarvelAvengersAcademy,d0z6amp,1,t5_3cbi3

6995802,0,t1_d1972wf,The problem is that the downvoting and moving on still leaves the sub clogged with multiple duplicate threads which makes it harder to notice unique topics. And if people are terrible at creating good titles you often do have to read the multiple threads to notice theyre duplicates.Plus its just plain old unnecessary. Theres literally no reason to do it except laziness. And so theres no reason to put up with it versus expecting people to not be lazy. I dont appreciate being expected to work harder because other people want to work less.People complaining about all the duplicate threads to the mods is precisely why we adopted these policies in the first place. So yes something was wrong. People reported it. Were doing something about it namely this.As opposed to looking at old outdated and irrelevant information in multiple threads or the same new information in multiple threads? Again its illogical to claim youre upset about something yet then turn around and be OK with larger amounts of that something.Ive had zero problems following the new posts in the megathreads. Sorting by new means most new comments are at the top and installing an extension like RES makes keeping track of new comments even easier. In contrast having to open and look at multiple threads AND then keep track of all the new comments in those threads is a massive headache. So again youre claiming to hate something yet then encouraging a practice that makes that something much worse.I really dont know where youre getting that only one giant thread is happening when theres actually multiple unique threads on the events topics. We certainly have been so far preventing the massive spamming of multiple threads on those unique topics that happened in past events which is a very good thing as far as Im concerned.,MarvelAvengersAcademy,d19bfki,1,t5_3cbi3
