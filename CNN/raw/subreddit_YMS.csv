1609057,0,t3_2cnp89,Out of all the von Trier films Ive seen this is definitely my least favorite.  In fact I would consider Lars von Trier a very overrated director although I did enjoy Antichrist and Melancholia.  But to be honest I thought it was a very bad film despite it having an interesting aesthetic.  I have a problem calling von Trier a provocateur because I believe provocation is to make aware the ideology within which the viewer believes.  Von Triers provocation is plagued by cruelty and misguided and insincere thoughts.  The films antiAmericanism is very pseudointellectual basically saying Americans are cruel and unwelcoming.  Im not saying all Americans are nice and welcoming but what American is von Trier attacking?  Does he not realize that a typical American in the north is usually different than an American in the south?  In my opinion I dont think America has a universal cultural identity but I dont believe it is the only one ex. England.  Von Trier has denied the antiAmericanism and has stated the film is actually about and Im paraphrasing loosely how evil can arise from anywhere.  The film does deal with that particular theme but in a distasteful way.  The films cruelty is subjective but at least to me I felt the presence of Von Trier with his camera and crew as if he was taking a distance like a deity and keeping his moral hands clean.  I can understand why someone would like the film but I found it repulsive and dumb.,YMS,cjhzm45,0,t5_2yap0

Use the best quality audio setting you can.  even if you have to record in  second chunks removing the audio from you phone each time. It will greatly inprove watchability.. Place your phone in a thickish sock.  This will dampen the harsh tones you can hear every time you pronounce your s c p etc. Fill you room with clothcarpet.

3717125,0,t3_32z0vv,Spoilers bruh!I wouldnt say Synecdoche is about death its certainly about a man whos plagued with the fear of death but it strikes me more as a cautionary tale about life. The thing to take away from Synecdoche is that while Cadens experience with despair is unfulfilling and tragic it doesnt have to be yours the film is trying to reject solipsism and tell the audience to live more for others rather than living like others are just objects used for selfanalysis. So many people are focused on analyzing their own psyches and become so obsessed that they forget to help others and live altruistically. Ive watched you forever Caden but youve never really looked at anyone other than yourself.Millicent says You have struggled into existence and now you are slipping silently out of it. This is everyones experience every single one. The specifics hardly matter. Everyone is everyone. The end result of life is universal. In a similar vein Eriksons last crisis is egointegrity vs. despair trying to find some definitive truth or winning the approval of some particular person arent methods to finding peace when faced with death. Living for others and with others without being so focused on creating some sort of immortality for yourself can be extremely fulfilling.Theres definitely anxiety associated with Synecdoche it shines a light on our own egos and fears of unfulfilled lives. Its normal to feel anxious as a result of the film but know that while Kaufman seeks to deliver harsh truth it doesnt have to define the way you live. At least thats how I reconciled with the dull empty feeling the film left me with for weeks after I watched it for the first time.,YMS,cqfz8tt,8,t5_2yap0

In my experience its a way to put someone elses tastes or preferences down because theyre different from yours. In the other direction people who dont like more popular or more generic movies or music or anything generalize people that do as being generic and boring.Really its a stupid thing to say about anything if you dont like it why not give it more explanation than its too hipster that just says that its not your thing.TLDR I dont like it when people generalize each other.

I watched this fully expecting it to be IN THE NAME OF THE KING or ERAGON levels of awful and it just wasnt.  Vin Diesel a massive fan of the genre worked as the witch hunter character and I barely thought of Fast and Furious while watching him.  The setting of ancient magic and mythology drawn into the st century was very well executed. A modest except for one scene blend of magic and technology which meant they didnt have to overuse the CGI team.  The movie just kind of worked for me. Whether thats due to the ultralow expectations I had or that the movie is actual okay I cannot tell you but I think its worth watching if youre looking for something in the fantasy genre.

I asked one of the devs thats been helpful in the past if the YouTube team was aware of the situation and got just a short Yes. For an otherwise wordy person I took this as annoyance with users for this issue.  YouTube seems to be more focused on YouTube Red as another market strategy which would cater to HollyWood its basically like a Netflix mode from what I gather.

It would be a stretch to say that the producers had the intention of ripping these movies off but I can see where youre coming from.  Character designs were distracting because of its contrast with the realistic background and the cartoony dinosaur plot was predictable and I felt as if I could see the writers of the film trying to pull my heartstrings in a forceful way. I heard the film was pushed back for more than a year due to its problems with the script and its pretty apparent especially in the last  minutes of the film.

There are just so many other great movies you can spend your money on.If you want to know about the story read the book its based on or an article on the story. The movie is just a very average crowdpleasing . Its not very well shot written or directed Its just bland. I guess the best thing I can say about the movie is that it told the story of these women to a mass audience.

The wellmade film not the youtube videoI disagree with Adam the racism element was front and center the entire movie. If the races were swapped it would fit right in to the anti race mixing propaganda of a previous age. It wasnt a bad movie and Im not the type to rant about being offended but I did leave the theater with a creeping feeling under my skin about what the film implied.     Edit To the downvoters Im not calling this movie racist and Im not offended. Go out and watch the movie but do it with my words in your head. See if you dont get that same creeping feeling. I cant say more about it without getting into spoilers but the revelation ths into this movie and the resuting ending are pretty messed up if you think about the implications. Its a horror movie.
