3602124,0,t1_cq2jt7k,gt Indeed I was ranting  but back atcha pal. You seem to think that JavaScripts implementation of OOP is much more flexible without describing why you think so.Quite simple  theres no distinction between classes and objects meaning that you can inherit in practically any manner and to any level  you can even define inherited properties on runtime if thats what you need. Having a distinction between classes and objects doesnt allow for that kind of thing.Javascripts inheritance model also means that you can extend and inherit from core types if need be. Strings arrays and so on aside from an implementation caveat with arrays. And there are many more flexibilities like that that youll run across in Javascript  you can effectively implement any paradigm you want yourself.gt And yes if its not something similar to what Im used to and requires me to learn WHOLE NEW AMAZING PARADIGMS to do just the simplest things compared to how Id do it in PHP and many other languages isnt that enough reason to dislike it or at least distrust it?In a personal sense? Perhaps. But what you are used to in no way reflects on the quality of the language  its literally just that your own perspective on it.

4253238,0,t1_cs51pvt,the mess with mysql. That is THE only function part of PHP core that has real appended to it. Great example there.  function in the entire language.Its not too late.  In fact the opportunity is there more than ever to create a proper namespaced core lib. The fact that there isnt a halfbaked namespaced core library there means that theres room for a fully baked core library. The fact that it wasnt done  years ago when the PHP contributing team was making a lot of poor decisions is a saving grace.  The current contributing team are making good additions to the language which means any proposal that does introduce a namespaced core lib that fixes some of the complaints people have with PHP.As for goto I hope you dont use the Linux kernel. That uses goto. I hope you dont use OS X as that certainly has goto used in it as well.  Id say Windows likely does as well but nobody knows except Windows kernel developers.If goto is good enough for kernels why is it not good enough for a proper language to also implement it?

4717552,0,t1_ctp4cbx,Not all is immutable  integers for example are not. And just like there is nothing to modify about the number  a pointintime is also conceptually immutable its not like you can say from now on the month in the date of April nd  shall be May and make sense to anyone. It does make sense to take a variable that contains a date and assign it a different date just like it makes sense to put the number  into a variable that previously contained the number  but the numbers themselves are immutable and dates should ideally behave the same way because that makes sense.Its not like someone sat down and said mutable objects are a darn good idea they make for very good and maintainable software lets make everything mutable objects  things are mutable in PHP because whoever designed them didnt think any further than the next few hours and being able to change the month part of a date value inplace seemed like a useful thing and it works great except that objects including datetime objects are reference types in PHP and so many variables in largely unrelated parts of your codebase can end up containing the same object and changing its month component in one of them changes it in all of them and then all hell bursts loose and you rip your hair out and then when you realize what happened you decide that you need to be more defensive about your dates and you start making copies of them all over the place which makes your code buttugly despite the fact that mutable datetime objects were supposed to make your life easier.    function foobarDateTime targetDate         beginDate  targetDategtclone        beginDategtaddMonths        endDate  beginDategtclone        endDategtaddMonths        return someOtherFunctionbeginDate endDate         when really your life could be as simple as    function foobarDateTime targetDate         return someOtherFunctiontargetDategtaddMonths targetDategtaddMonths         or if PHP were actually completely sensible about     itself    function foobarDateTime targetDate         return someOtherFunctiontargetDate  months targetDate  months    ,lolphp,ctp6pa9,4,t5_2rt7j
4761135,0,t1_ctuo62c,I understand but my point of view on this is if you need specific tools to enforce coding standards people will find a way to fuck up things anyway.

4879946,0,t1_cu9ev90,I laugh at PHP having different data types for numbers. Really its hilarious.A language that at one side tries to do away with the concept of data types by promoting automatic conversion between strings and numbers etc to try to make it easier and more intuitive to the newbie programmer will at the other side introduce the completely nonintuitive distinction between floats and ints. Why is that necessary? What does it accomplish? besides becoming more of a laughing stock?Either you treat all numbers like numbers and forget there are different types like other well thought out languages such as Perl where a numerical comparison between  and . will yield what you expect or you have a full typed language.But of course that isnt good enough for PHP.
