9492131,0,t3_56q3v3,If you want to make a future type beat I would make the bass a bit deeper. Another thing is that could be changed is the beginning it took a while for it to dropbut i guess if you had someone singing in that part it would be fine another thing is that some of the bells you used had a lot of high frequencies so id eq that out. I really like what you did with that piano id raise the volume on that a bit. In general i liked it and thought it was pretty chill. ,beatmakers,d9j3wln,1,t5_2se2h
