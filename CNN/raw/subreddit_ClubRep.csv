10987129,0,t3_5wteba,Size US   Personally I would love to see more helping each other in the community by giving good valid information and not being pushed to the side or made fun of for not knowing something. A variety of reviews of all reps would be nice not just Yeezys. Detailed guides on how to purchase who to purchase from and just a more clean and organized way to share and spread information with each other  like beginners guides and stickied posts along those lines. Thus cutting out the need for people consistently asking who do I buy from? and such. Im excited to watch this community grow!,ClubRep,dedcu69,1,t5_3jb6d
