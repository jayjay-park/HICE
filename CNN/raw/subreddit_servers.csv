4240731,0,t3_39h4od,HiThis isnt really the best place for this sort of request. I would really go look at getting a cheap VPS for like yr on LowEndBox and just setting one up yourself. Its really not that expensive.,servers,cs3mw6p,2,t5_2qzvh
4240807,0,t1_cs3mu0p,Thats why I was thinking it would be interesting to have an e hosted at home. You could have the flexibility to really mess around with it without having to worry too much about the consequences. As far as reliability goes it would be  unreliable I feel. And my goodness thats a lot. I guess it is likely because you only would really need that chip if you were going to be sorting lots of traffic so to speak.,servers,cs3n7dq,2,t5_2qzvh

5424618,0,t3_3p9m5l,If you are going to be using it in a test lab scenario and not production you could use user grade hardware and build a cheap computer. Server is more of how the hardware used.One thing you should check though is if the hardware supports virtualization because not all of it does. Look for Intel  VTx AMD  AMDVYou can make a very affordable quite build that should suite your testing needs.,servers,cw51uqv,2,t5_2qzvh
5716442,0,t1_cx5f4vo,As far as airflow is concerned you wont beat a server case they are designed to have the absolute best airflow of any system case on the market but yes they can be quite loud. Dell precision Ts and Ts may be another option. They are built just as well and are quite a bit quieter.As far as looks are concerned yes a custom case will blow anything proprietary out of the way. Just keep in mind the points i made earlier about fitment.Edit Please note that Im not trying to sway you one way or the other either way you will end up with a good machine. Im just throwing out some alternative ideas and providing some information i have from past experience.,servers,cx5oifi,1,t5_2qzvh

7771138,0,t1_d3oeg76,Well damn. I knew the power consumption would be bad but I thought you could mine effectively with modern highend consumer GPUs  ie not specialized  so it might be worth it anyways. The Nvidia cards are labelled P and GB. Searching for the former brings up this page but they dont look like that  heat sinks instead of fans and no output jacks just two sixpin connectors and one eightpin. Hey even if this doesnt go anywhere thanks for the help. ,servers,d3pil0c,1,t5_2qzvh
7789090,0,t1_d3rf4zq,ZFS is available on almost all distros ubuntu is now shipping it in their main repository. Grub supports booting from it as well so a ZFS root on the latest ubuntu version is quite easy.New versions of AIX  UX are really hard to come by AIX doesnt run on x IIRC could be wrong about that. Regardless older versions pop up on ebay cheap every now and then.SCO Unix is out there somewhere but i would really reccomed against it. IRIX is fun to play with but its old and not x compatible.If you want to play with something really funky give Plan  a spin.,servers,d3rjtlo,1,t5_2qzvh

8300213,0,t1_d5f1nmo,OpenVPN seems like a thing Id definitely like to try. Would love to set up a mail server but I really dont fancy paying for another VPS as I barely use it.DNS Server probably is too complicated for me at this point.The storing my personal files on someone elses servers thing even with me in i assume full control of the operating system can they still access it? Damn I should probably stop storing my nudes there I guess lolThanks for the suggestions by the wayEdit Bit of a dumb question but why does a VPS need to be dedicated to mail server?,servers,d5f31xe,1,t5_2qzvh

11165990,0,t1_desuf9o,Any old laptop will work the serial console looks just like if you were sitting at a text console at the host when you power it on. Youll see a sun banner and memoryprocessor info and get a chance to choose your boot device if one is not set. You would use a device like an AS if you needed to connect to multiple hosts and didnt want to be in the data center to swap a cable around. There is a lot of info online about hooking up to the serial port of a sun machine. Once you get the appropriate serial cable connected rj to DB if I recall correctly for that host and a terminal app running on your laptop you should be good to go.One word of caution some usb to serial adapters do not support sending a serial break command over the line which is a problem for breaking out of the boot sequence into the prom monitor for selecting an alternate boot device like cd or net for example. Ive found the best is to use an older laptop with a real onboard serial port like an old Dell laditude D or similar. ,servers,dexniww,1,t5_2qzvh
