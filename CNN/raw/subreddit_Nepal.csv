2219994,0,t3_2kjwhz,aa personally I am not fine with the having the International Airport at Pokhara. Pokhara itself has fragile geology last incident is having sinkhole also heard that there is lots of limestone in beneath the soil in those area and having the international Airport in such a area will degrade the geology and environment of the area. I think it would be better to have one International Airport at any of the terai lands of Nepal,Nepal,clm0izs,3,t5_2qs6h
2227951,0,t1_cln0pdu,Haha I am not an expert but in term of aerial distance  km is not a thing. I think you should look at the whole geology of that area. Armala is just a symbolic incident there could be many of such issue in years to come. Personally speaking I am not against having airport at Pokhara but if we are investing on something why not invest in the better place than this. I know it wont stop its all huge demand of the huge business man hahah. If everything goes on well then there could be flights but after many years after it is established there could be many natural hazards in the area that will be triggered by the infrastructures we develop there.

3322066,0,t1_cp6j56n,The conversation is going round now. gt It doesnt reject Veda. How doesnt it reject Veda? A verse in RigVeda says Shudras are created from the feet of God. So how can I believe in Veda and not believe in God?For believing in Veda you have to pick and choose which part to believe and which not to according to your own logic which is saying your authority is bigger than the authority of the Vedas and you are deciding for yourself which verse is right and which is wrong.This is turning out like a debate with a Christian who says Bible is the truth but they pick which part they want to believe and which part not to. If you want to say parts of Veda is wrong its absolutely fine. But then you dont accept the full authority of Veda which makes you a Nastik. If you are an Astika you say Veda is right you have to accept the authority of Veda on the creation verse too and then if you accept the creation verse how will you then not believe in God?,Nepal,cp6xznh,1,t5_2qs6h

Of course its not required to take  take it as a source of knowledge but it must require  to take it as a supreme authority.gt I dont see a problem here.I too dont see a problem unless you say you can be a religious Hindu atheist believe in authority of Veda but not God. I am never debating whether you can be a cultural Hindu and an atheist you certainly can like many culturally Jewish atheists.Those people who claim ancient Hindu people who wrote the Veda were geniuses who knew everything about evolution to genetics are just blatantly lying and its frustrating to see educated people supporting such claims as Gotra system is scientific based on Genetics Veda supports evolution etc.,Nepal,cp76adu,1,t5_2qs6h

3687888,0,t3_32mcxu,First question  . Regular normal eye contact.  . Less than normal as you have to show certain level of respect which is conveyed by lowering your eye level.  . Interviews are not so common in jobs as you get jobs more by recommendation. However I would say this varies from low eye contact for respect to normal eye contact for show of confidence.  . Presentations are the same everywhere. You meed to make sure audience is gripped so yes a lot of eye contact.  . Normal eye contact as waiter are seen as inferior. So basically you are in control.  . Depends on the relation. Some have casual with normal eye contact while others have relation  based on respect so less.  Second  . Nepal especially the cities has heavy western American influence.so thumbs up basically means good or best of luck like in US.  . Yup it is also the same. You could show that sign to signal some thing was good or ok. Like conveying food was delicious.  . This is tricky. It depends also on the tone or situation on what it means. But it mainly means No or you dont agree.  . Again subjective. As level of respect for elders are held high and is very important which talking with the you should generally let their thoughts sink in before puting forward yours even though they might say something stupid. And among friends or juniors you are free to talk when you like or interrupt.  . Being angry.  . Kids normally do that if they made you fool lied to you or they dont want to obey you in playful manner. But for adults it is not used to convey anything.   Third  . Among good friends it is completely acceptable to stick together or put arms around and chat. Also one thing is you can sleep  take nap with your friends in same bed without going all homophobic about it.  . A respectable distance.  . I would say again respectable distance.  . Well it depends on presentation right? You want to sell something you have to be as close too your audience as you can else it is just the normal distance.  . Again subjective to relation. Chatting while sitting together on same sofa to sitting across the room.  Fourth  . Yup! As I said before you could put your arms around your friends when talking.  . Not so appropriate.  As it is in most part of the world .  . Sometimes you might give a little pat to a waiter as you are considered superior in this exchange.  . Well you are family so it is of course acceptable. But again depends on type of relation you have.  as most part of the world,Nepal,cqcn6t8,1,t5_2qs6h

3959880,0,t3_35tk5v,Nepali here from Kathmandu.   People here are scared.   The state of the building both households and businesses is not good.   And I think lots of them require renovation of some sort.  The volume of people going out is huge and lots of supports and reliefs are coming in. So I am pretty sure the roads are busy as well. Even if you manage to come through air you ll have a pretty bad time due to all the confusion and rush.Aside from that there are events of landslides and more is bound to follow.   So I d have to advice you to not come at this present time.   Regarding the capital.   After the earthquake of . a day ago people are even more scared and confused and they dont know what to expect next.Around  of the population in the capital are living outside in the tents so I m pretty sure the majority of business is closed.   If you do want to come anyhow finding a room to stay depends on your selection of places to stay.High end hotels are operational as they are strongly built but I dont know about their occupancies so I d recommend you to contact them and find out prior.    Majority of buildings destroyed in Gongabu and Balaju area were guesthouses. So you should avoid them at all cost.   Tourism and other sectors need help thats certain but now is not the time. Now is the time to gather help and carry out relief activities and head towards stabilization.   After all this is over you are welcome to visit us as a tourist.

The Indian Express story based on that anonymous source caused quite a firestorm in the Nepali media today. I think that Indias diplomacy has been too latetoo publictoo loud.

6196145,0,t1_cytwwjy,Dude you should chill if you want to continue the discussion...From the link you sent it actually situates the deal within the larger politics of India as a market not a one off exchange surrounding the jet deal. I am not saying the issue wasnt necessarily connected but you are saying that India said no when the news seems to suggest that there were other factors driving aid elsewhere... Again I dont see your point in insulting me here. I am happy to recognize it as a factor but would like to read where it is written that India told the UK to go elsewhere and that the conditions of the Aid were you also have to take our jets  it seems to me that there were other factors including market politics... Re Christian Aid   DFID funding was  of their Institutional grants and contracts which they say are  of their overall income.  from private donations this is from their  financial report. So yeah DFID is  of ... Sorry unless you are accusing the annual report of being wrong. Re DFID funding Christian Aid in Nepal  yeah they may have gotten gov funding but not DFID funding. You seem to ignore my language. They get private donations... And yeah you may argue that some of the overheads from preexisting projects went towards EQ relief but its not like DFID gave them a contract for a project or direct costs. If you think this is the case it would be in the DFID press releases where they announce partners. I know this because I know who DFID relief partners currently are.Lastly  I didnt say I was objective  I dont think such a think exists. The tone I think that is directed against NGOs is unfair... here are some quotes that made me think this. I hardly would consider that I constructed a straw man when people wrote stuff like thisQuotes from this threadDo people in rural areas who get free skill training or healthcare or infrastructure be it a school or a simple bridge or a library care what kind of lifestyle the INGOwalas are living or that they are spending  of the donations on ineffective items?   NumberThey dont give a fuck about Nepal they have  other charities that are just as good.  by you referring to people donated to Nepal relief.In light of all this the Indians said hey this aid is hurting us more than its helping please stop. by you where it is documented that this was said I dont know.Hell stay at the Hyatt but hell visit a slum and pose for some photos of the earthquake ruins. Then hell return to the US where his church will devote a special corner of their bulletin board to pictures of Brother Whatshisnames Nepal trip. by you speculating on what someone is doing without any evidence. So whats really happening is that US or British or European taxpayers pay for foreign aid budgets which then go to these INGOs which spend large portions of the money on sending dozens of pastors from petty little churches for photoops so they can spread the word. by you  do you have proof donors are funding missionary work?... Again I have pointed out that Christian Aid and LWF arent being funded by DFID at least.Again look I agree there is a lot of waste and a lot of ways to improve but I dont think conflating missionaries with INGO sector or making inflammatory statements is really all that useful of a discussion. It also doesnt really pinpoint where the changes need to be made. But yeah I will call it here from my side. Sorry it couldnt have been a more productive chat.,Nepal,cytxp3v,1,t5_2qs6h

6645944,0,t3_46mp7l,For chhyang the trick is to cook the rice halfway or maybe  and not fully. Then you cool to room temperature and put the rice which will be sticky due to retained water into an airtight container in which light will not get through along with Marcha local brewers yeast. The Marcha has to be thoroughly mixed with rice using your hand for equally distributed fermentation. Give it  days and your chhyang will be ready. Filtering the chhyang is tricky. You take a strainer which has holes big enough to allow small bits of rice through but not large enough to let whole grain or even half a grain. Chhyang is good if it is a little sweet and has bits of rice suspended in it. Your chhyang loses sweetness and starts smelling bad as it gets older. So try not to keep it longer than  days after brewing. Enjoy.,Nepal,d06qyes,2,t5_2qs6h

6815093,0,t3_492lv9,What I am going to write is based mostly on my own observation and experiences. I hope I am wrong.One of the common characteristic about most of us Nepali people is that we are too complacent with our lives. This complacency has distinctly manifested in our common vocabulary and linguistic expression. When something goes wrong with our lives we commonly attribute it with phrases like karma yestai ho this is my karma bhagya futeko broken fate nidar ma yestai lekhera janmeko ho it was all written in my fate arko junima next life dukkha suffering... Someone from this subreddit had recommended a book called Development and fatalism by Dor Bahadur Bista. I picked it couple of weeks ago and read it. He points that fatalism is the core characteristic of our Nepali society. I thought how did fatalism become so ingrained in our society perhaps it is through the traditional religious customs and lifestyle or perhaps it was developed during the times of Rana Shasan whereby docility and passivity was actively and often violently enforced in our countrymen by depriving them of education restricting movements imposing caste system at national level pushing forth certain moral while depriving others. Or maybe it is little bit of everything.I run a hotel and I meet people of different kinds from various parts of the world. When talking to my guests mostly tourists I noticed that many of them were fascinated by what they termed as laidback attitude of the Nepali people. In other words the fatalistic attitude of the Nepali people we are selfsatisfied with our meagre existence. There was a guy from London who had lived in Kathmandu for few months and he said to me if the kind of the people that lived in London lived in Kathmandu there would be riot all over the place. Its amazing how Nepali people are able to live so calmly in a city with such severe shortages. Of course he meant it as a complement. But for me it came back to this idea of how powerless people are to determine their destiny. Lets take one obvious example its now an open secret that some of these top politicians have been pocketing the money from the treasury that had be filled with foreign aid meant for the earth quake victims. But nobody seriously bats an eye to challenge them. We might hear it in a complaint format from some hardly read newspaper or from enraged taxi drivers or we might the criticize politicians in some casual conversation. People are aware but they have accepted it as norm. . billion was aided to Nepal after the earthquake. As to the international report none of this has actually been spent. Blankets and tents were donated by foreign aid meant for the victims of the earthquake. Instead of giving these donated essentials to the needy people as it was meant to be the policemen who were suppose to be the distributors started selling the blankets and tents. By in large majority of the poor victims were left out. People are very well aware of it and many are outraged. But this outrage has only been limited to frustrated taxi drivers local teahouse and bhatti and online discussions that includes me.There is no longer a fight in us to fight for a better society anymore. Weve been exhausted with ten years of civil war another eight years of political instability natural disaster exclusionary constitution and constant shortages. The spark for the fight has been put out with fatigue. As this article represents we are just waiting. Others that cannot afford to wait move away to foreign lands to exchange their labour for money with hope that they can still preserve their dreams. Some make it others toil under the heat of the sun in the desert only to come back in a wooden box.I had visited a village in west Nepal couple of months ago. Majority of the young ablebodied men had left the village to work in foreign land. The village consisted mostly of women children and old aged people. The ablebodied women did most of the work that men traditionally did essentially functioning the village. It wasnt necessarily the case that there was no honest work left in the village in fact there were plenty. As one of the grandfather from the village told me Jaat jancha bhanera yaha kam gardaina while the young men do leave the village for money abroad they leave more so because they are ashamed to work in the village in fear of losing their status ego. It is one of the supreme irony of our society we do not care whether we have to work the lowest of the lowest job in a foreign land where nobody recognises us but we care with extreme ego of what our folks think of us when we do an average work in our own country our own village. I am beginning to think that most of us Nepalis have an obsessively harmful fetish with foreign land.In the same village I met a man who had gotten back from the Gulf. He had worked in a strenuous heat all day under the kafala system just to get paid once in three month earning Rs  per month for which he paid lakhs via loan to the manpower agency to send him aboard. After three and a half years he came back to his village in Nepal for good invested all his labour and money into honeybee farming. Now he earns double the amount of money he made in the gulf simply by selling honey in his town. The realisation that cleared the speck of his eyes about the opportunity available in his own homeland came only after he struggled in foreign land. Maybe because our country was too close and too isolated from the outside world for centuries that it is in the instinct of Nepalis to go abroad to see whats it like even if they have to suffer. Then when they come back they come back wiser. At least not everything is in vain.Despite it all Ill have to go along with the authors repeated word wait. We will have to wait and see. Wait and see that maybe in a decade or two that many Nepalis that have gone abroad will bring back the knowledge to the country folks that if they invest their money in their own village town or city rather than in manpower maybe if they put the same effort in Nepal as they would in foreign lands even if the pay might be smaller maybe the egoistic mentality that seeps into our soul and vocabulary as ejjat will no longer hold power maybe we wont blame every misfortune in our lives and society to our bhagya or karma and we will actually take the initiative for actions to better ourselves and our society.,Nepal,d0osdvm,10,t5_2qs6h

7861768,0,t1_d3ze26v,I think you are missing the point here. Let me explain again. My original post above is not about his article writing or how he writes it. He writes article about Nepal once in  or  months?? I dont read his articles anymore as I think he does not have that much knowledge like some prominent journalist have regarding Nepal. But yes I do read his tweets as he usually post interesting news from outside buzzfeed. My rant above was more about how he should be conducting himself in public.Like you said he holds a position at one of the most respectable news agencies in the same way he should know how to conduct himself well in public. Its not about sarcasmhumor tweets that I dont understand or being jealous its about them being in poor taste. He should be conducting himself in high standards with the position he holds. Twitter is not a private place but more of a public sphere and a medium of communication.  I dont care what he says privately in  facebook but recently for past few months I have seen the way he tweets completely change like generalizing people being sarcastic form of humor trying put humor with a threat about sex with animals in poor taste. This isnt what he is supposed to be doing especially by breaking the very fundamental of journalist values. If he is having a discussion its ok but blocking them calling people trolls Thugs and threatening someone with his position at Buzzfeed even if it is humor is not right. Its not like he has no way to go around this he has an option to ignore them. With his strong one sided tweetsopinion also people not being able to criticize sarcasm and poor taste humor his credibility in his job goes down with it too. I dont think he understands this nor do some people here in rnepal. There is like literally thousands of news report about people getting fired for their opinionnotsowittyjokes on twitter and there is a reason for it. Here are some examples ,Nepal,d3zqfal,2,t5_2qs6h

8646690,0,t1_d6lzogy,I dont know what your buddy told you but the bit about phoning home to get orders from the home country has been published numerous times in media across the world. Its no secret. The UN itself has internal investigations ongoing and the issue has been raised in UN Security Council sessions.Your buddy is  wrong about the hardly authorize any rescue bit. You only have to check the UN Missions own web pages to verify that. The peacekeeping missions main job is to save civilian lives so rescuing civilians is exactly what they are there for. There is absolutely no other objective more important than that.gthow upset they would be if conflicts were to stop how would UN get to spend billions in aid and rescue Its everybodys vested interest not just the UN. The UN peacekeeping budget is the largest portion of the UN budget so theyre interested in maintaining it. The countries sending peacekeepers make a lot of money. Currently the UN pays  per soldier per month plus all the food maintenance and organizational expenses. With  UN personnel from Nepal the Nepalese government is currently getting  million a year in hard currency from the Sudan mission alone. If you count all countries Nepal currently has  personnel among UN peacekeeping forces so its getting around  million a year from the UN as payment. Nepals entire defense budget is only  million so you can see how this is a significant contribution. The UN payments dont go to the soldiers they go to the Nepal government which gives much lower salaries to the soldiers. Obviously poor countries also have a vested interest in continuing peacekeeping missions. Rich countries have a vested interest in peacekeeping operations because many of these conflicts directly benefit them in the matter of controlling resources around the world. So long as it only costs them some pocket change and not actual human lives they dont much care. They keep their own soldiers out of danger let someone else be cannon fodder.I dont blame the UN for any of that. I dont think the UN deliberately keeps conflicts ongoing to make money. As I said in my previous post I think the problem is just that many conflicts have outgrown the UNs ability to handle them. The UN has no role in civil wars involving militaries they require army action like NATO or the USs Coalition of the Willing in Iraq or Afghanistan. You cant counter militaries with peacekeepers they arent equipped for that. If youre sending a soldier to die for someone elses country sending him to a fight thats not his own at the very least give him the tools and freedom to have a fighting chance.

9357570,0,t1_d91yot6,Yes. There is some form of syncretism between Hinduism and Buddhism in Nepal. Buddha is given equal respect as any other Hindu Gods by the Hindus some even worship him as an avatar of Lord Vishnu and Buddhists also celebrate major Hindu festival like DashainDusherra and Holi. In a famous Buddhist site in Kathmandu called Swayambhunath there is a statue of a lady God which is worshipped as Manjushree by Buddhist and Saraswati by the Hindus. Some caste and groups among Newarsan ethnic community in Kathmandu valley follow a mix of Hindu and Buddhist traditions.I personally take pride in our countries progressive attitude towards LGBT people. We have a gay person as a member of our parliament. I love the expression on the face of my western friends who love to beat their chest over how liberal and progressive their society is when I break this news to them. I think this progressive thinking towards LGBT people come from our HinduBuddhist roots. Sanatam Dharmis have always been an accepting and tolerant bunch. We live by the philosophy of live and let live. Even in India I never witnessed any hatred towards LGBT people. In Delhi across my friends house there was a building where Hijra people lived. Nobody hated them and everyone was nice towards them and treated them with respect as fellow human beings. I think its the leaders in India that needs to change their attitude towards LGBT people. Most Nepali I know really dont care about these controversies surrounding Buddhas birth place. I think its his teachings towards which we should be channeling our energy and focus. People who make fuss over these issues over the Internet are usually teenagers and idiots driven by fake sense of nationalism. They are just looking for a reason to get in an argument Buddha and his teachings are last thing on their mind. Rest of us are sick of these people hijacking every Buddha related thread and videos and filling it with hateful comments. Isnt it ironic and funny people fighting over a person who gave up his life as a prince to preach peace tolerance and loose the sense of ego.,Nepal,d92516e,3,t5_2qs6h

10986274,0,t3_5wv575,Most Nepalis are really really lovely people  try and make some friends! Maybe even start with a company for a day tour around the city and take it from there? Id take the time to learn some basic phrases  youll likely get around just fine in KTM with English but its helpful not to mention polite to at least try with the language. I havent been there in years but a couple of things pop into mind as far as what to donot to do. And I really take issue with the commenter below who says do whatever you want  its that attitude that makes for a disrespectful tourist  your experience shouldnt come before being respectful. Heres what I can think ofDont pass things especially food with the left hand. Its considered unclean Nepalis wipe with the left. Nepalis eat with their right hand.Especially for women dress modestly when visiting templesholy places also rural areas. Though Kathmandu is pretty touristy and it isnt uncommon for some to dress in the Western style Nepalis are generally kind of conservative so dressing in revealing clothing can make everyone uncomfortable.Pretty much everyone appreciates a nice greeting  shopkeepers taxi drivers etc  a simple Namaste will do the trick.If you see a pile of shoes by the door to somewhere take yours off.Totally my  cents here I was born and raised there but havent been back for a visit in about  years. Someone who has been there more recently will be more helpful with the money questions. Its typically very affordable when you get there though.If you decide to go have a great trip!! Its a really stunning country like breathtakingly beautiful and like I said before Nepalis are generally very friendly kind lovely people. Do some research before you go and also talk to your doctor to make sure youve got all the necessary shots.,Nepal,ded9cft,1,t5_2qs6h

Used to spend hours behind the computer sucking faces and playing with her boobs. Like your ex mine also didnt let me have sex. She said she want to but only after marriage. So only option I had left was dry hump her. So this one time I had my dick pulled out and humping her pretty hard and sucking on her boobs. In the middle of the action with her eyes closed and horny facial expression in a soft sexually aroused and fumbling voice she goes aja ta pregnant nai hunchu ki kya ho. Still gives me chuckles when I think about. ,Nepal,dewys96,16,t5_2qs6h

Doesnt have to be the one where she had a bad experience. There is nothing wrong with a male doctor doing checkups. . doctors act very professionally especially when dealing with opposite sex. Maybe tell another female friend or family to accompany her. I think she is just feeling shy or watching too many hindi serials or doctor porn.One time during my regular check up I had a young pretty female doctor hold my balls while I coughed.

11289980,0,t3_613gp5,Dont bike on the highway from Kathmandu to Pokhara! That might be suicidal. But I believe there is a little known trekking route between the cities.Ive heard of people hiking from Kathmandu to Pokhara so if you can find the route you can probably bike it. Id expect the trekking route to consist of trails and jeep tracks and possible stairs or suspension bridges you would need to walk the bike over.I dont think it would be suicidal but its always better to go with a companion. If you prefer you can find a Nepali guide who will smooth over issues with route finding and language. Probably no tigers around there. Being polite flexible and having good humor about language issues always help. Finding places to stay in small villages might be hard without knowing the language. I did a little wandering around Nepal off major trekking routes. I recommend finding a good map with towns and villages marked. Then you can ask locals the way to the next town marked on your route.,Nepal,dfbpbe3,1,t5_2qs6h
