5053081,0,t3_3k47hl,You like hardly ever attacked and double jumped every chance you got and air dodged the whole way.You also ran into smash attacks you never applied any pressure went for grabs or restricted falcons movment. Whenever you were approached you jumped where he couldnt reach you only to be punished upon landing.Im sorry man I dont mean to sound rude but it was bad. You seem to have a lot to learn about the game in general.,FalcoMains,cuv36b8,5,t5_39anz
5681917,0,t3_3rjjn2,I learned by doing really fast and low dairs that the higher the percent the easier it is for me to recover being so low. I dont know if it has something to with the hit stun frames being longer for spikes I would test it out if I were you. Great play wish you both were at  stock though. Doesnt come often to have opportunity for double spike.,FalcoMains,cx1ebrr,1,t5_39anz
6598101,0,t3_45x3a6,Ok. So it looks like you have some answers for the DAIR but not the RAR BAIR. All you have to do is dash the initial animation at the start of your run in one direction dash the opposite direction then short hop. At this point its preference as to whether or not you want to use the cstick or the A button. Just perform a normal back air after the short hop. It takes a lot of work to get this down. Hope this helps,FalcoMains,d01spyn,1,t5_39anz
