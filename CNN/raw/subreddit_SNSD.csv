Im pretty sure most of them were still in high school definitely the  line  Seohun and at least some of the  line.  Even when Gee was released Seohyun Sooyoung and Yoona were all still in high school.  The  line graduated about a month after that and Seohyun didnt graduate until .,SNSD,cegbxaj,-2,t5_2s1g4
19011,0,t3_1ubfh3,Hey OP Im one of rSNSDs resident metal heads. I was born and raised on anything related to heavy music. I started listening to Kpop around late early ...a much different genre. I knew of SNSD before though I listened to other groups like Brown Eyed Girls and whatnot. But once Genie came out I was hooked.One thing I could tell you be open about what you listen to and give no fucks. Im not saying go out there and proclaim it like the gospel but dont deny it. People always ask me You listen to Kpop? Is that like your guilty pleasure?I have none of that. What Im supposed to feel guilty for listening to what I actually want? But you dont even know what theyre saying!SO.FUCKING.WHAT.It sounds good and I like it. But I do see where youre coming from this is a good place to be with others who enjoy the same music and youre always welcome here. Just dont be afraid about what you like.

1320672,0,t1_cihy7rj,you wanna argue? she can date and fuck whoever the fuck she wants. it has nothing to do with me. I was straight forward with where im coming from. Theres no need to be an insensitive basher. Your an active member of this fanbase reddit thing. Theres no need to posture yourself as some neutral objective eunuch that doesnt lust for these girls and is somehow above all the other deluded fans. I really did explain what you needed to know in my last post to you. Your last post was a bunch of stuff i never said. even if you are a eunuch who doesnt lust for them. if you cant understand how someone can understand taeyeon is her own person and make her own choices. While at the same time be able to question her choices cause opinions are allowed. Then i cant help you with your problems in understanding things.Have you ever had a friend where she always ends up with goons who mistreat her because she just continues to make the same mistakes in choices. if you relate that EXACT example to taeyeon and her boy you really need to do a lot more thinking on your own.The point is thats my opinion of the guy shes with and as far as they are concerned that would be my problem. Cause they have nothing to do with me. Think on it yourself. Please dont bother me anymore.,SNSD,cii6y24,-1,t5_2s1g4

2022020,0,t1_ckwu2v1,why notand why would anyone in the sonedom or anywhere else take sides with the company on this.Look. This is their statement from SM.Hello. This is SM Entertainment.We are offering our position on the words posted on Jessicas Weibo today.This coming spring due to her personal situation she notified us she will halt her team promotions with the release of one more album.Despite Jessicas sudden notice the agency and the Girls Generation members tried our best and tried to figure out a way that Girls Generations activities can continue in the best possible direction.However in the midst of insufficient negotiations regarding conflicts of differences in priorities and interest Jessica started her fashion business. Due to this despite ongoing talks it has come to a point where the team could not be maintained.Thus the agency had no choice but to pull up Girls Generations activities as  members earlier than planned and in the midst of while working out when to announce this Jessica had posted her words early this morning.From here on our agency will continue to support and manage the member Girls Generation and Jessicas individual activities.First line says they are directly responding to jessicas weibo post. that means this statement is a response crafted to deal with jessicas post. This coming spring she has a personal situation. She will stop team promotions after one more album. So she was gonna leave. Then they mention the fashion business as an conflict of interest. They say that was the direct reason to boot her cause it sounds more lawful. Even though the spring event is actually her marriage and not a blanc debut. Or the spring event is her departure from the group.So now were thinking. She was gonna leave. but they jumped the gun on her. They werent going to announce anything but cut her activites. And jessica went public with it. They actually gave her credit for blowing the horn on the plan to have members. What do i conclude from this? SM is once again a shady company that is dodgy and scetchy and pulls all kinds of stupid shit with their people. Jessica had a proffesional plan to work through with SM. And SM is working out how to fuck her over. That is where we are at now with close examination of their statement.,SNSD,ckwulzw,0,t5_2s1g4

2074873,0,t1_cl3ghks,She could have left out that part of the statement about the members though dont you think?Ofc she could have damaged the group more directly but this isnt helping situation either. I def think that selfish is the right word to describe some of Jessicas actions.She was in USA for the whole month of September and while some of the girls who are busy with their dramas radio shows album promotions all bothered to practice and prepare for their upcoming Chinese fanmeeting she only showed up day before the schedule.Also she didnt bother to hide her relationship with Tyler Kwon for some time now and you know the issues with dating in Korean ent industry.She also supposedly wanted to leave the group.Btw dont you think that she could have delay her BLANC business for only a couple of monthsif she wanted out or for the rest of her contract?There is also that Hong Kong club incident where some peopleeven some of the Ksones talk about that in that back alley actually was Jessica and Tyler Kwons cousin or something like thatit was reported that it was Yoona and Taeyeon.That party was the night before the actual HK GG concert.I am not taking this as a fact but if this is true that is obvious lack of caring by Sicas part.My personal opinion is that Jessica selfishlyunintentionally tried to do both SNSD and Blanc and I am not even counting those rumours of design schools in USA and companys latest actionrenaming the blanc and putting the HQ in NY talks for itself.SNSD and Blanc together is impossible.Dont get me wrong I am not saying Jessica is entirely at fault here and trust me I am disappointed in the members decision of kicking her out even with all of this said and ofc in SMs managing of the issue but I think it all started from Jessica.With that said I will do my best to support both rest of the SNSD and Jessica I can never turn my back on either of the members.I just tried to view this from all the possible angles and I had to come to a conclusion and KSones view helped me a lot in cementing my opinion on the issue.At the end of the day think about thisWould you really think that the  members would force or kick out Jessica without reason?And also I dont think this was quick decision as you said.One more question do u think that SM would kick Jess out for no reason?Hopefully one day we will find out the whole truth given the info we know we can only assume.,SNSD,cl3k8b9,2,t5_2s1g4

For someone claiming I have Asperger Syndrome you obviously have social problems of your own. The majority of your comments involve you calling people stupid virgins etc.  Im sure that makes you feel better about yourself and serves as a distraction from whatever is bothering you in life.  Tip try switching up the word pedantry.  Its overused in a fair amount of your comments you should seek a new word from your thesaurus.,SNSD,cz4y20s,-1,t5_2s1g4

8634457,0,t1_d6kc1df,Unfortunately there is a big reason to take it seriously even tho it was plainly unintentional.  The problem for her is the appearance of being someone who does not care enough to be aware of the most basic history and sensitivities of the country thats been hosting her massive success for ten years.   I agree shes not stupid  but shes made it look like she is.No PR experience here at all but my gut tells me the only PR counterfire thats going to work is an apology that goes way beyond the formletter shes provided so far.  She has to prove she understands the full magnitude of her error is heartbroken about her own ignorance and the appearance of ingratitude and is taking concrete steps to educate herself so no such errors happen in the future.  Shes so likable I think people are dying for a chance to forgive her  but SMEnt is acting like they no longer trust her enough to give her another chance.  Ill hazard a guess they have already decided to cut her loose and are just waiting for the storm to blow over a bit before they announce her retirement from SNSD.Your remark about PR partners is the crux of things.  How many advertizers called in to put a stop to their SNSDbased promotions  probably  percent.  Unless SMEnt can separate the rest of the girls from this somehow  and seems to me Tiff has to be either rehabilitated or terminated to accomplish that  theyve got no reason for further existence as a group  and Id even have to wonder about solos.  SMEnts decisionmaking is probably now focused on salvaging whatever they can.  And so far it doesnt look to me like Tiffany is part of their plans anymore.  If so its a mistake imo because I dont think SNSD can survive another termination without losing the remainder of the charm and sincerity that defined them and made them what they are  or were.  Might as well shut the whole thing down if they cant trust Tiffany with a sincere and meaningful apology.,SNSD,d6kwxe3,1,t5_2s1g4
8642856,0,t3_4y8xl5,absolutely positively agree with all the OP amp the  previous comments.  I can tell you though I stepped into this fracas early on with the same things you all have said amp have been repeatedly told.I paraphrase.Its a Korean thing you ifans cannot understand.you ifans cannot understand the depth the offense.amp in response to my points about the possibility that she did not know that that particular stylized geofilter was based on the Rising Sun. Oh she knewShe should have known she in been in Korea for  years.She posted that FLAG intentionallyYou said it a witch hunt pure amp simple.  A bunch of  year old kids who of course never lived through the Japanese occupation  taking the opportunity to try amp take down Tiffany amp SNSD.

8969655,0,t3_533s0p,Honestly. This album was an audio lookbook which is appropriate because the highfashion styling for all their stages was sooooo on point. I have so many favorites. I think TTS has so much Western appeal idk why SM never tried it...but I digress. Though I was in the minority who LOVED Holler I agree that Adrenaline just blew it out of the water and turned out to be my fave on the album. But there wasnt any grab bag songs on this album for me. I loved every one. So their styling is always my favorite. They need to let Tiffany style a full GG tour.My favorite looks  Versace Versus Gucci Crystals on nude SMA Battle Costumes Red GDA Battle Costumes Black Whisper Lace Adrenaline s Throwback Only U Burberry SMA Red Carpet,SNSD,d7q0lu8,9,t5_2s1g4
