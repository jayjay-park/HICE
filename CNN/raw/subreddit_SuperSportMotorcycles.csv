11259507,0,t3_60pcxr,Very few bikes are design for tall people so ride what you like as long as you fit so cramps or knee pain doesnt effect your endurance.Your weight will tame the performance but the suspension will have to be set for you as stock its for a  lbs person. Lots of aftermarket options for heavier springs so you could take a passenger and have the bike handle properly.,SuperSportMotorcycles,df88y8g,1,t5_2xcad
