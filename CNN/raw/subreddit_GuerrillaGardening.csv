Crimson clover would be excellent if you could sprinkle it on bare ground. Coreopsis if you can get the seeds for cheap.You might just look for bags of bird seed that are filled with black oil sunflowers. Thats one of the cheapest bulk seeds routes I know of. If you have any stores that sells dried beans in bulk think hippie stores that sell them for sprouting or whatever you might be able to cheaply add some legumes in that way. Legumes will help soil fertility and the sunflowers. Another option is to head to your nearest feed n seed or Tractor Supply and see what they carry.Eden brothers sells bulk wildflower seeds Everything Ive gotten from them has done really well. They have a mailing list that is pretty obnoxious but they do have some good deals in there.Please note that Im not sure how well these will work in seeds bombs Ive always planted in or sprinkled stuff directly on the ground depending on whether the seeds need light or darkness to germinate.These people are near you and while I dont think you want their pricing they may have some species recommendations  Hope that helps. Be sure to take pictures and keep us updated! It sounds like a brilliant and challenging project.,GuerrillaGardening,d1wff87,7,t5_2s8v5
