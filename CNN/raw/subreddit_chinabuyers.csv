1650943,0,t1_cjn4idp,Agreed and thank you. My main concern is whether reverse engineering it and selling it will lead to legal issues even though the brand name design is changed?I personally find it hard to feel the moral aspect. Anyone who deals with a china factory is dealing a blow to the manufactuters of their own individual countries after all.It doesnt matter what you buy from them the fact that anyone supports and utilises a mass production outlet for business rather than sticking to contributing to the homegrown economy model is proof that morals are quickly forgotten in business.,chinabuyers,cjn9jpw,1,t5_32y99

Anything with a battery motor bluetooth or wifi.  Would also stay away from any clothing that needs to be a correct size.,chinabuyers,cjpn0jm,3,t5_32y99

5630935,0,t3_3n97wk,IT IS NO SO PRACTICAL TO SHIP BACK BAD GOODS TO CHINA IN TERMS OF TIME AND COST. IT IS MORE PRACTICAL TO HAVE FACTORY PRODUCE EXTRA OF GOODS TO MAKE UP THE DEFCTS IN NEXT SHIPMENT OR COMPENSATE THE AMOUNT.  iIT IS STRONGLY SUGGESTED TO CONDUCT A Preshipment Inspection   BEFORE GOODS LEAVE CHINA SO CLIENT CAN MAKE DECISION TO SHIP GOODS OR NOT AFTER REVIEWING THE THE  Preshipment Inspection.,chinabuyers,cwv2k46,1,t5_32y99

By using that code you can track your product and when customer receive their order then they got a mail that order is received by the customer. Even you have also got a message in which delivery boy no. is also mention and sometimes delivery boy call you for assurance that you are present at your mentioned place.,chinabuyers,d20v6wy,1,t5_32y99
