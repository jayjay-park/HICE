5146719,0,t3_3k38gp,Loved your review. I had a question before I throw money at the screen This thread is really confusing. Some people say its so bad and has no bass while others say its awesome sauce.Was hoping you could read though a couple of pages and confirm my suspicions that most of them are monkeys would couldnt tell their ass from their head. I dont want to have to spend over a  canadian dollars only to have instant regret. But I will say that your reviews havent led me wrong yet the HM is still one of the best closed back headphones I have hear in terms of neutrality. So I trust your impressions that these are fucking amazeballs. ,ZeosReviews,cv6dfk8,1,t5_2xuur
