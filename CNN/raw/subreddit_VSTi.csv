10010019,0,t3_5izxdp,ReFX Nexus is popular in dance music and hip hop as it has a lot of those sounds.Kontakt is popular for acousticlive instrumentation.However Id suggest as a synth player you learn your instrument as most synthesizers have the same functions. Start learning subtractive synthesis and then you notice all the knobs are the same. Then learn additive synthesis and youll be able to use more complex programmable functions. The value of a synth player is having a guy who knows how to use those knobs. Otherwise the singer could just stick a keyboard in front of himself and they could fire you.,VSTi,dbcc1t1,1,t5_2sql2
