There is a noticable ticking sound when you watch the videos later.

2258002,0,t3_2l1hqm, Missoula is a liberal hippy town. Lots of craft beer drinkers. Everyone smokes pot. It is a pretty hard partying college town. There is a great downtown bar scene. There is good fishing kayaking mountain biking hiking decent skiingsnowboarding. The pollution can get kinda gross as the weather in winter can trap it between the hellgate mountains and it just sits over the town for a week or two. Missoula is also dubbed Rape Capital USA so theres that. Bozeman is more of a frat boy style yuppie skibum town. Still fairly liberal but not nearly as much as Missoula. There are also a few craft beer breweries in the area. Bozeman has a decent nightlife scene but aside from the Beermuda Triangle most of the bars are spread out. Bozeman has world class fishing world class skiingsnowboarding you can float the rivers on tubes in the summer great hiking. Montana jokes that Winter is long as hell and can be brutal. Although with climate change it seems to be milder every year. First snowfall can start about Halloween or early November. Snow usually sticks on the ground by Thanksgiving. There are usually a couple weeks of subzero temperatures in January. Winter usually lets up in March or April depending. Bozeman does a good job of clearing the roads at least emergency ones. They usually get a LOT more snow than Missoula. Missoula is west of the continental divide so they get some but the clouds usually keep it and them dump it after going east over the divide.  Missoula does a decent job of keeping the roads clear. Both cities are craft beer friendly. Lots of great local breweries. I am partial to Zootown as I went to college there Go Griz! You can do lots of outdoor stuff in both towns. The skiingsnowboarding is way better in Bozeman. You have Big Sky Bridger Moonlight Basin all within an hour or so. Missoula only has Snowbowl and it gets crowded. Both teams are huge college football towns. We have an epic crossstate rivalry Cat vs Griz. So choose wisely. Umm Missoula is very dog friendly. I dont know about Bozeman sorry.  Missoula is very friendly. It kind of reminds you of a small Portland OR if that helps. Beards hipsters punks hippies mountain men everyone is a closet stoner. It is very gay friendly.Bozeman as I said is more frat boy style. Lots of rich ski bums who come for world class skiing. MSUBozeman is a technologyagrarian university where UM  Missoula is a liberal artsforestry school. I would say that Bozeman is more religious than Missoula is. If you want to go to church both towns have it. Is Montana super religious? No not at all. It just isnt what defines Montanans to be religious. Spirituality manifests itself in many people but its not a culture dictated by religion. If you want to drive in the mountains get something with WD. Trucks are fine. SUVs are fine. It just depends on what you want. If you just want to get up to the ski hill a jeep or SUV is perfect. If you want to get balls deep in the mountains and kill a deer or an elk you will need a truck. Every vehicle in MT comes standard with a block heater. If you dont have one already in your vehicle every auto shop can install them for fairly cheap. If you wont have a garage I would absolutely get one. Subzero temperatures can really mess with your vehicle. There are days when basically the whole town shuts down because no one can make it to work. Last winter in Missoula they had a really nasty cold snap that turned into an ice storm. Basically no one went anywhere for a few days.I hope this helps!,Montana,clqt6dv,11,t5_2quij

If GttS is closed getting to the east side of the park will be a very long drive and you might want to spend a night in Babb or Many Glacier or Two Medicine to see more of that side of the park.

Condon is a great place if youre going to be splitting some time up hiking the Bob and the Missions but trails in each area are way below what you will find in Glacier in terms of width and softness  and some of the trails in the Missions are very tough indeed the hike up to the spectacular Turquoise Lake in the Missions is gorgeous  but its tough and then you have to remember its one of the easiest hikes in the Missions.  So if you really are all the way down in Condon I would recommend heading farther south to Seeley Lake and checking in at the Rangers station to see what trails are open and if there are any bear concerns the Missions are a grizzly haven.  ,Montana,cs02vr5,2,t5_2quij

Imagine I ask you to build a new standards body to create common rules for multiple parties to follow.

10213316,0,t3_5m87bl,What a joke this article is. A person overheard someone say gays and lesbians everywhere while admitting to not knowing the context of the conversation and had to be rude and interject herself?As far as we know the conversation could have been this Missoula is awesome maybe our daughter who is gay would have a better time there finding a partner because there are gays and lesbians everywhere.or maybe it wassan fransisco would be a better place for our son who is gay to move too hell have a much better time finding a partner since there are gays and lesbians everywhere. It could have beenLook how far Montana has come from its days of bigotry gays and lesbians everywhere.But nope. This person had to get up and interject themselves into a private conversation of which they admitted to themselves that they had no clue what the context was other than just someone muttered the words gay and lesbianThis reads like a long version of This has it all. Gay couples everywhere. Just married gay couples. Just engaged gay couples. Minority wait staff. Wait staff pouring out of the kitchen to deliver champagne at her smiting down the male cis oppressor. Instead of literally shaking her spine was tingling.This is more material for rthathappened than anywhere else. Hey Molly why arent you publishing this in the area afraid someone is going to call you out? This happened at Wasabi didnt it? The only sushi restaurant in whitefish.

11042843,0,t1_dejh44y,No worries! Part of my question which to be fair was just a mind vomit of all the concerns of have is if  trees is way too much for one person even with a strong will lots of free time right now and good strong sledsnowshoes. I might have help from a neighbor for a few days looking to get that sweet sweet pancake coating. The maples are a trek from my house or truck from the road probably  minutes just to get from car to touch each tree if it was a race. That could end up being a pain in my ass  is what I mean since I think you have to collect every day. Add in  birch trees that are closer but still spread out and this might turn into a full time all day job. Do you know about how much time I can expect to spend per tree in its sap run?,Montana,dejoqls,0,t5_2quij

Based on who they choose and the primary reason the Dems choice could be good or bad.If they choose Gianforte from New Jersey who ran for governor recently it could be good. If they choose one of the Republicans with governmental experience it could be a sign they are going to use that against Quist.If you are looking at governmental experience qualifications Curtiss was much stronger.
