2372403,0,t3_2miefm,My quick search couldnt find anything. But my guess would be that its just bug fixes. The game for me at least has been pretty buggy. Such as characters not being in story levels or when I come back to the moon from a lanturn planet it will have both areas loaded at the same time.,legogaming,cm4xqex,1,t5_2yxox
4467685,0,t3_3arukv,I dont know if this has already been answered for you but I was having the same issue and it turned out that I had not purchased all the characters. Once you rescue the workers in peril you have to purchase them for use in free play. I was missing one bought him got my Plat. ,legogaming,csttsua,1,t5_2yxox

I cant help you with the issue sorry.,legogaming,d2cyzsb,1,t5_2yxox
8106428,0,t3_4oe9ve,No matter how much you want a real game it wouldnt have changed anything for TT Games.  They wouldnt have made it.  Theres no point in looking at Lego games as if they somehow prevented other games from being made.  If you dont like them thats perfectly fine.  Theres nothing wrong with that.  People have different tastes.  But you should understand that TT Games creating a new Lego game in your favorite IP doesnt actually prevent anyone else from doing a different game with that IP.  If there are no other games being made thats a different problem completely unrelated to the Lego games.,legogaming,d4r8h87,1,t5_2yxox
