You eventually give zero fucks.  I try to prevent real body damage.  Rock rails help.,FJCruiser,clsmvle,1,t5_2si0x

6235281,0,t3_40zmnr,Took a turn too sharp and rolled over. People say I went airborne during the roll since I hit a little median which makes sense since the roof rack is undamaged. Regardless my insurance company is totaling it before even the appraiser had a look at it so I wont be getting my FJ back. I feel like I really let her down. But on the upside no cuts or bruises on my end  curtain airbags deployed.The worst part is I cant even get another FJ because I own a landscaping company and I was using the FJ as a tow vehicle since I already owned it. Now I dont know what Im going to get. I hate the appearance of pickups but for towing they make more sense. ,FJCruiser,cyydtm3,3,t5_2si0x

9090616,0,t1_d84g3xo,Maybe its just me but since I put a lift on mine I havent had that problem. I just figured it was the front pointing down. I remember hitting flooded pot holes when she was stock and not being able to see spit for a minute driving down the highway.,FJCruiser,d84jn4n,2,t5_2si0x

10143472,0,t3_5l76xs,You need to know your zone number though. Im in central North America. My zone is  or  I think. Been a while since I set it. Stubby antenna from Amazon. I never really use the radio and AM reception is pretty spotty but I usually just have Pandora on anyway. If you replace the spark plugs use Denso. Use Denso on everything if possible. I put iridium plugs in my  and it runs great. Definitely have the alternator tested. They can do it at Autozone if you dont have a volt meter. If the TRD didnt come with the FJ rubber floor mats get them. At any cost. They are effing amazing. Make sure the dealer has done the recall on both the seat belt apparatus on the suicide door and the TRD brake rotorscalipers. Theres some pretty neat center console solutions from third parties. Check those out. Also cargo solutions for the rear compartment. ,FJCruiser,dbtp5n2,3,t5_2si0x
