3790773,0,t1_cqo0t19,Well you seem to be...well unconstitutional in a few of the planks. Why restrict what our leaders can say? That makes it ok for them to restrict us. Why not allow them to have incentive to leave a position by getting paid for their service? Or allowing them to have a good career set up after a term? But then turn around and tell them they cant have more than a certain amount of time in office?True Officials stay way to long in office. I even agree with your proposal to limit them. But not the proposal that punishes them for leaving even if it is bribery.But my biggest concern is that you have no stance on education. Which is probably one of our biggest issues and even the root of many other issues. You complain about the miltary budget. If  you want them to shrink it that money  in my opinion needs to go somewhere that we know will positively impact society. Like our education systems. Theres tons of other stuff i could say. But i dont have the time. But I do like what youre doing here. But you are not looking at how your proposals will interact if they are all passed. And the people who pass or deny them will. You have weakened yourself in a few places by allowing your ideas to clash. ,MakeAmericaBetter,cqodn0r,1,t5_32kik
