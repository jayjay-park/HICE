6935642,0,t3_49xq7p,Im a bit late to this thread but Ive had a few listens to the full album. Its really fucking good and keeps getting better each time I hear it. If you like their previous releases you wont be disappointed. They try out a enough new soundstechniques to keep things fresh but overall its Vektor through and through.I am slightly concerned about how some of it will translate to live shows though especially ChargingRecharging. Theyve had to drop a rd guitar part here and there from some songs like Forests of Legend or Destroying the Cosmos and sometimes transitions arent as tidy without a producer there to smooth things out like on Tetrastructural Minds or Outer Isolation. But for the backing vocals theyll probably have to play to a click track which they havent so far to my knowledge. Could end up making them even tighter though.,thrashmetal,d12hcw5,1,t5_2s66e
