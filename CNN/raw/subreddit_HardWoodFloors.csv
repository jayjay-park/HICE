But these were  planks and the guideline for boards over  wide require to be either glued or nailed down to prevent cupping and the customer chose nails. I didnt like it at first but it grew on me as the job continued.,HardWoodFloors,dcoze2v,2,t5_36btj
10624915,0,t1_dd9rkc0,Im not saying that other methods and tools dont help. Im saying that while yes in certain situations other tools are useable the sharp scraper is the most effective tool. A sharp scraper removes old finish in about half the time it would take to use a multi tool and sand paper. ,HardWoodFloors,ddbvngt,2,t5_36btj
