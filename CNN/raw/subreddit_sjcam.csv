10875573,0,t1_de1pnzl,Oh yes SJ specs are very weak compared to current specs.  But three years ago when I bought mine they were almost matched with GoPro.  I was just mentioning my model for point of comparison.  Its older but still good.  Newer models should blow it out of the water.  If I bought again Id buy an SJ for the most current specs.  I dont mind the M but I do not like the M vertical design.  ,sjcam,de1qkqn,1,t5_32u69
