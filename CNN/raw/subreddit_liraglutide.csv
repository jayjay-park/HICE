8179284,0,t1_d4z78bx,Hi  Youre totally right I reintroduced a low carblow calorie diet as well the Victoza. Im waiting to see what my Thursday oneweek weigh in is as I expect there will be some fluctuation between now and then.  Even though this initial loss cant be representative of my trajectory for the course of treatment it does motivate me to keep going through the side effects  dizziness fatigue nausea to name a few. Hopefully it even out and be the traction I need to finally get to a healthy weight. I have PCOS and have always had trouble loosing. So glad to read youre doing well a month in. It sounds like youve really been hitting it hard  building a shed is no easy task. Well done  go lady go! Good luck on this and everything related ,liraglutide,d4zyk4v,1,t5_39rtw
