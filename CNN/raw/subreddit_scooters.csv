Get a filter and oil per the specs in your owners manual.Some tips   be ready to clean up a mess if its your first time.  Do not over torque your oil drain plug.  If something gets stripped its probably not going to be the plug.  This will make you cry so dont do it. Have a container and funnel ready to receive oil from your dishpan or whatever you use. Wear gloves.  Used oil is bad for you. Dont lose your oil plug or crush washer if you have one in the pan of used oil.  This sucks too.,scooters,cevg3np,1,t5_2qnhc

1252971,0,t1_ciajawv,At the end of his first reply to me he wrotegt There was no way I wasnt going down at that speed with that distance to stop. That means he thought that there was nothing he did wrong or could have done better or differently to avoid going down in that situation.  Yet he said that he locked his brakes up in his very first post.  Hes blaming fate and the other driver without acknowledging that locking up his brakes could be a critical error that directly led to him losing control and thus resulting in the actual collision that happened  him hitting the ground.gt But thanks for making it my fault.Then he falsely insinuated that I was blaming him for everything when I limited my statements only to the part of the accident that was indeed his fault  the losing control after locking up the brakes part.To clarify this at the end of my next response I wrotegt And no Im not blaming you for the actions of the driver that led to the chain of events that exposed your lack of riding skill.He might not like that answer but I meant it and I still do.  Locking up brakes in an estop is a lack of riding skill which he was denying and continued to deny for post after post.  He was obviously refusing to admit that his own actions played a key role in the accident.I never blamed him for the whole accident.  I was always referring only to his reaction at the time and his belief that there was nothing that he could have done differently or better  the attitude that it was merely fate for him to low side.  That kind of fatalism denial ignorance and lack of selfcorrection is very dangerous.  Locking up the brakes is one of the most common causes of fatal and major injury accidents.   Loss of control by a solo rider accounts for a huge percentage of fatal accidents even when it was preceded by the actions of others.,scooters,ciakowm,1,t5_2qnhc
1262147,0,t3_28jso0,Probably not. But without knowing the brandmodel its impossible to say for sure.When you run without an airfilter its basically like running your scooter with a much smaller carburetor jet. It gets too much air for the amount of fuel going into the engine. This condition is called running lean.Engines running lean run hotter. On air cooled engines running too hot can cause the piston to expand more than the cylinder. This can lead to damage or at least accelerated wear to the cylinder wall or the piston. If the piston expands too much it will seize in the cylinder.Running lean can also lead to predetonation sometimes called pinging due to the noise it makes where the fuelair mixture gets so hot it explodes before the valves are closed. This can damage the cylinder head.Water cooled engines are less susceptible to this issue but its still not a great idea.Fuel injected engines may be even less susceptible to this issue but they might not be. I dont really have that much experience with injected scooter engines.You definitely dont want to keep doing it if you have an air cooled scooter with a carburetor.A lot of scooters will hardly even start without the air filter on. If yours is like that then you especially definitely dont want to keep riding it without an air filter. If theyre hard to start it means theyre do lean they will barely run and if theyre that lean you are asking for seize.Ill also note that engines that are running lean have noticeably more power than an engine thats running stoic ideal airfuel.So you might ride it with no air filter and thing Dang this thing is running better than it has ever run until it seizes.Also sometimes with air cooled enginges they seize while youre moving along at a good speed and by the time you pull off to the side of the road to restart the piston has cooled enough that the engine will instantly start right back up.This is called a soft seize.You may experience a soft seize and not even really realize the engine seized. You may think you dodged a bullet. But in reality each time you seize it does a little more damage to the cylinder and the piston. And each new seize may be your last  either because it finally seizes up good or because it finally does enough damage that the engine wont run despite not seizing permanently.Running a lot too rich is much safer than running a little lean.If your old air filter is just dirtyclogged then it will impede airflow and have the opposite effect of running without a filter. Its like you upjetted. It is MUCH safer to run like that than to run without.And if you want to run without the air filter long term of if you are replacing a stock airbox with a cone or pod filter then YOU MUST rejet.It would be much safer to run without an airfilter if you ordered a larger jet and installed it. And even a different air filter should be accompanied with a rejet.,scooters,ciblve0,6,t5_2qnhc

Youve either got a break in the wire unlikely or the resistor has gone bad quite likely given the low quality electrical parts used in these scooters. However for  you can have a whole new unit shipped to your door... Edit If you want to try to change that resistor yourself youll need to find it. As I said in the earlier post its probably in the cap. If you find it post a detailed close up photo of the resistor no potato all of those color bands mean things and we can help you identify the correct replacement. Youll also need to be able to solder. If you cant just buy the unit I linked above. ,scooters,cq57peu,1,t5_2qnhc

4798152,0,t3_3gbueq,If I were you Id flush the engine out every  miles with fresh oil and do this maybe  or  times. This might cost you a bit since your scooter uses an oil filter but I think its worth it since the oil that you described coming out was basically whats called sludge and this stuff is stuck all over the inside of your crankcase and cylinder head.  In addition to flushing out the oil I would add some Seafoam to the oil right before an oil change.  The Seafoam supposedly helps clean the inside of the crankcase when added to the oil but only add Seafoam to the oil right before an oil change.  Add the Seafoam to the oil and ride around for  miles and then change the oil.  And then I might take it a step further and do the Seafoam treatment to the engine.  Seafoam now makes a spray that allows you to just spray the Seafoam directly into the engine intake tube instead of the old way of finding a vacuum line to feed the Seafoam into.  Although done on a car this video  shows you what Im talking about.  After all of this I suggest switching over to a high quality Synthetic oil like Mobil .  A high quality Synthetic has much better protection for an air cooled engine than what a Conventional oil can provide.  Btw Pennzoil Platinum and Castrol Syntec arent high quality Synthetics.Also I would check the oil level frequently and try and keep it topped off at all times.  That sludgy oil might have worn the piston rings a little and your scooter might burn more oil than usual.  My Kymco Super  was broken in properly but it still burns a tiny bit of oil and I have to add some oil like every  miles.,scooters,ctzch0p,2,t5_2qnhc

7375507,0,t3_4gaisc,Im planning to get a scooter in the upcoming months and there are a few things Im wondering about.You seem to have plenty of space on that scooter so do you simply keep all your safety gear in there when parking? If yes then do you still have enough space to do things like grocery shopping?You said you rode in winter and were still chilly when wearing layers. Could you give more details? How low were the temperatures? What kind of clothing were you using to try to stave off the cold? When you say chilly do you mean a little shivering...or almost constant shivering?Also speaking of riding in winter did you drive during snow andor icy conditions? If yes can you describe what it was like?Moving aside how long have you been riding this scooter? Did you have any mechanical issues at all with it during that time?One last question that might be more minor. I looked up the specs and it has a fuel capacity of . gallons so even with MPG Id imagine you still have to refuel pretty often. Do you find this inconvenient?,scooters,d2gjl46,1,t5_2qnhc

A few phone calls later Ive bought a bike and Ive got my CBT booked.Although I wasnt confident my instructor was patient and we got there in the end I was deemed safe and capable enough and that was that. Suddenly I was able to ride back to our family home and see my daughter every day and I was mobile. At last at the age of  for the first time in my life I could truly go wherever I wanted to without needing the help or assistance of anyone.
