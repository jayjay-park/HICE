4359490,0,t1_cs74pbj,Ultimaker suggest to heat the nozzle to C for cold pulls and specifically to use PLA.  You run some straight through the head shut the thermo off and keep pushing the filament through until it is too solid to push through the nozzle.  You let go and make sure to cold pull wicked hard by C minimum.Check out the Ultimaker forum.  It is very helpful.,ultimaker,csh1qgf,1,t5_2txcg
11462101,0,t3_63jkxk,Whats the current set to for your extruder?Have you tried switching to the second extruder port on the motherboard? Swap the cable?Does it extrude if you just let the Bowden hang outside your print head?    Can you make it skip with no Bowden cable just by holding the plastic directly out the top of your feeder?  Can you see through your block and tfm coupler clearly if you remove the nozzle?   Can you push plastic through the hotend manually?Replaced your filament?Will you be dropping it off the golden gate bridge?  If so can you tell me what time exactly so I can...Uh... Help you?All these things youve replaced blindly and I dont get a sense that youve actually isolated and replicated the issue independently.  Skipping is a feature designed into feeders to prevent grinding when it takes too much pressure to push it.  Either your set screw is too loose or something is in the way.  Each possibility can be independently tested and the system isnt really that complex.The other possibility is.... Your coupler and spring are not tight enough.  This lets hot plastic seep up and cause a clog.  The Bowden tube needs to be firmly planted into the tfm coupler then you tighten the steel coupler the last couple of turns to get it nice and tight.,ultimaker,dfv802g,1,t5_2txcg
