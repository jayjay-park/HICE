5464183,0,t3_3puhb9,I dont want to gloat or be a weirdo so I post within a FB group where everyone talks about fitness stuff. Its a good way to filter out those who dont give a shit about your gym selfies. On big milestones I do post to FB. Instagram I like to post my meals and sweaty face or proof of mileage. Also some fun pictures from the k and a photo of me and my daughter fitting into my old NYE dress. Dude that was really funny. I ended up getting a lot of supportive and WOW comments. I wasnt fishing I thought it was neat.,teamcandycane,cwa3n2n,2,t5_3afwn
5541820,0,t3_3qwd9r,I travel a ton for work too and its really hard! Now I always make sure that my hotel room has a fridge bonus points for microwave too and I bring a hot water pot too. Before I even leave I made a written plan for the time Ill be away so I know which meals I have with colleaguesclients and which ones I can handle myself and I make a shopping list. Then the first thing I do when I get to wherever I am is hit up the Whole Foods. I  do the min workout in my room or just walk as much as I can if I cant  dont want to do any other exercise. ,teamcandycane,cwk0iqk,2,t5_3afwn

As for calories stay low with salt and calories by sharing your food or splitting a plate. You end up eating way less. You dont have to sabotage yourself by going out.,teamcandycane,cx5snjn,1,t5_3afwn
