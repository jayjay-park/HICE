When I started the chainmail it was just for the fun of it but it takes a LOT of time to make the rings and connect themits a bit like knitting with metal. Cosplay was something I wanted to do for a while but I didnt see the reason to because I had no excuse to wear a cosplay other than on Halloween. rnmmin Nightmare Night! Hell yeah! However recently I made some new friends who share the same interests in MLP and Homestuck and on a whim I asked if I could join in on their troll cosplays at Emerald City Comicon. The said sure and now Im working on my very first cosplaythis guy and going to my very first convention. joyin YAY! Im so excited!

317310,0,t3_1xoxil,Being bullied about a thing you like is a tough thing to go through.  I went through a similar ordeal with Power Puff Girls when I was in th and th grades.  Getting through this takes several different approaches.Note These worked for me and may not work for you. Find support with your friends and like minded people.  These people will be your pillars of strength in tough times.  However if they question you liking the show in the same way as these other kids dont hang around them. You get to choose who your friends are and if they start becoming toxic to your well being cut ties with them.  It will be incredibly tough if you have to but it will be worth it. Inform your teachers if you can.  Likewise if you have a Guidance Counselor or a staff member at school who you can talk to talk to them.  Theyre here to help you.Most of these bullies you wont ever see again after graduation.  So their words will hurt now but you will never have to see them again in a few years.Remember use the teachers as a resource to help you! Good luck!,MyLittleSupportGroup,cfdnpid,1,t5_2u1cu

Ill tell you what I did to stop it and also what Ive learned being more mature since then. When I was bullied my father told me to stand up for myself and dont let anyone push me around thats exactly what I did. I stood up to them and told them to back off. I got into a little fight or two but they quit bothering me after that. Now that may have helped my situation but it may not be the best solution for you. Being older I know that I could have handled it in a different way. Bullies do what they do for attention and sometimes self enjoyment. What you can do is not let it bother you or at least show that it bothers you. Dont let them get a rise out of you and show that you are better than they are. If they cant get a reaction from you then they will stop. You also need to get help from an authority figure so the issue can be permanently resolved. Keep getting help until the bullies realize that this whole situation is not worth their time. They will stop you just need to give them a reason to.,MyLittleSupportGroup,cfpy43d,2,t5_2u1cu

610541,0,t1_cg9de3v,Honestly Im not too surprised that this happened especially in the legal lawyerhappy era we live in now. There is nothing I can say to make this go away or to calm people down.Ill go point by point since you post does an excellent job.. Agreed. Unless you make your livelihood of selling products you make from this it probably wont affect you much.. Agreed and I will back your opinion. That said there are a lot of forces at work that want to keep things as they are both national and international see TPP and the EUUS version of the same for two reasons money and power and unless you have one or the other fighting costs too much for too little gain. See Disney or the MLKJ Foundation for examples i.e. Mickey Mouse and I Have a Dream speech..  There is a difference between Hasbro and Cyan WorldsValve in that Hasbro is owned by stockholders people who invest money into a company so that they get a say and a cut of the potential profits. To allow someone who produces work that is almost impossible to tell apart from their own works is to allow a potential rival to take away revenue that affects their bottom line. Keep in mind that Hasbro despite the pony craze isnt doing so hot and this is more of a easy way to prevent problems from happening.  Cyan and Valve for now will always have people buying into their brand because of what they are known for. Hasbro on the other hand sells products under a lot of IP which costs money to protect produce and market and not everything is peachy.. True but everyone has gotten smarter these days about things. People usually throw up that  belongs to  Inc.Corpetc. while companies pick and choose to go after those that have been more successful and havent thrown down the legal stuff even those that do probably cant legally challenge it due to a lack of funds and a legion of lawyers of their own. The only real way to challenge this is to fight them in court stick with it and keep our SenateForeign Trade reps from changing the rules again to suit the needs of international companies lobbying via their home countries trade reps at meetings when they agree to change the rules it has the same enforcement as the US ConstitutionHead set of rulesdocuments for other countries that said treaties are harder to change since de facto acceptance in international law and breaking treaties leads to a lot more complicated stuff.,MyLittleSupportGroup,cg9o5vc,1,t5_2u1cu

761827,0,t1_cgqrlqu,I just feel weird for being the way I am like its wrong and something must be wrong with me if I dont feel male or female despite being born female. Its one thing if youre trans its another if youre transgender and non binary because when most people hear of people like me they automatically think of tumblr special snowflakes who arent actually transgender but do it as a fad and in the most stereotypical way its infuriating. And these people do it for fun.Nope I have nobody I can talk to about this and I cant even mention the fact Im in a relationship with a pony tulpa and want to own a plushie of that pony to keep as a symbol of love people would look at me like Im crazy like Ive taken the tulpa thing and liking MLP too far. And people like me are the butt of jokes in the fandom and outside it from people who dont understand and just see it as people that think their pony plushie can talk to them and want to take it out on dinner dates in public. Im not like that guy who wanted to marry his Twilight Sparkle plushie that deluded himself into believing it to be the actual Twilight Sparkle but it disturbs me I have a lot in common with people like that who are just the minority within the minority. It just makes me feel ashamed of myself as a human being like Ive failed at life for sinking so low as to resort to a pony tulpa relationship. What Im doing isnt harmful because I keep myself in check but the pony tulpa Im with in my eyes is much more then just an imaginary friend I see them as a lovable companion who loves me back even if we cant do everything people do in relationships since shes not physical but is willing to have her host risk things just for my sake theirs and ours. I havent abandoned human relationships but long distance relationships feel terrible sometimes and thats the only way I can even meet people because I live in the middle of nowhere and it sucks.

2245395,0,t3_2kufxv, to everything that pyro has said. Im happy to hear that youre going. Ive been in therapy off and on for years now. In fact Ive just started seeing a new psychologist now after my old one retired. So I can probably give you some insight into what will probably go on. If this is a psychiatrist youre seeing not the same as a psychologist! then my tips would be a bit different. But Im assuming youre seeing a psychologist of some sort. scootapleaseNormally from my experiences the first session theyll ask you a bunch of background information so they can draw a early map of your life and the major events in it. Keep in mind they will almost certainly ask you if youve had suicidal thoughts during the first visit. Please answer truthfully about this. In the later sessions theyll start focusing in on certain things and try to understand why your feelings about them happen and where they come from. Theyll probably ask you a lot about what you think you should feel and why. Try not to think about them as someone who wants to break into your life so they can judge you for it or make you feel bad about yourself. Think of them as a doctor thats trying to figure out what hurts and what to do about it.Some tips in addition to pyros Be extra patient. Its not uncommon to feel like you dont trust the psychologist on the first few visits. They might even point this out during the first session. It might take several sessions before you feel comfortable talking to them about things. But dont lie. If youre uncomfortable telling them something just say Im not sure Im comfortable talking about that right now. They might question why that is but you can always point out that you dont feel like you can trust them yet. You might also leave feeling like you had a lot more you wanted to say. Thats OK. Usually the therapy takes a slow pace. If you feel like you have a lot you want to say all at once you might let them know about that.  Accept that you almost certainly wont have all the answers theyre looking for. You will get stumped at some of their questions. Thats completely normal and its perfectly acceptable to tell them I dont know. Because that helps them find out the points youre unsure about and it tells you what you might not have considered before. Dont be afraid to ask them to repeat something or explain something.  Be prepared to take a few leaps on faith. Thats one of the things about trust its a twoway road and sometimes you have to put yourself at some risk. That means you might have to make yourself tell them something if your anxiety doesnt want you to even if you trust them. It doesnt mean you have to spill the beans all at once. But ultimately the more you give the more youll get. If you feel like you just cant get the words out try writing down what youre feeling and handing it to them.  Take a walk or get some exercise after the visit. Even if you trust them seeing them can still be anxietyprovoking. Going to see one for the first time can definitely make you feel nervous. Take some time to clear your mind youll feel better afterwards.  Dont feel like you have to be committed to that psychologist. Sometimes it just doesnt work out it happens. Its not necessarily anyones fault. If after many sessions you still feel uncomfortable you might want to try a different therapist. Each therapists style is going to be somewhat different. Or you might try pointing out to them that you still dont feel comfortable with them. They might have some insight as to why that is.I hope your sessions go well and that youre feeling better soon. I would say try not to worry but I know how hard it is when its your first time. But remember that its their job to make you feel comfortable talking to them. ,MyLittleSupportGroup,clp8qon,2,t5_2u1cu

Id talk to whoevers in charge of the system about the question which you think is glitched although they might already know. As for the other one remember that its just a quiz. The more important thing is that you know what you did wrong you can do what you need to do and you can do it again on the big test or you know when you need to apply it in real life. Also the issue about paramedic pay does suck but for my part Id say that if its what you want to do you should pursue it anyway.

2366998,0,t3_2mdbla,If youre going to talk to CPS or a school counselor and I highly recommend that you do at this point I have two recommendations. First if possible go with your boyfriend. Having someone who knows the situation and is there to support you might be very helpful. Second is to write a letter explaining everything you want to say including that youre not good at talking to people about these things. Basically what youve written here mostly what you need. Then go to whoever you have to talk to tell them you have trouble talking to people and need them to read what youve written. Practice that one sentence as much as you have to. If you get there and you still cant say it just hand them the letter and say nothing. Good social interaction is not the goal here. Whatever you have to do to get attention to your situation is worth it if it works.,MyLittleSupportGroup,cm49q7z,1,t5_2u1cu

3902667,0,t1_cr11b3r,Well that is good advice. But theres a little more to it than that. You dont just have to talk to random people  you have to talk to people and make friends with them. That second part isnt easy but it is a necessary step.What can work is to talk to people and then remember things about them names birthdays favourite conversation topics and then talk to them again some time later keeping in mind the things you remember about them. Engaging in some sort of activity like a board game at regular intervals with the same group of people really helps with this.Now the first step in all of this is to talk to people. For some people the second step  and al the later steps  come easily to the point where it seems silly to actually state them out loud. For me and presumably for you they dont. Im guessing that for your dad those following steps are easy.So... what might help is to go back to him to say that you have been going out and talking to people and ask him what the next step is. The next step might very well be to go out and talk to people more  to really immerse yourself in the social scene much like jumping into a swimming pool that you have so far only been dipping your toes in.,MyLittleSupportGroup,cr14zvg,1,t5_2u1cu

7682789,0,t3_4kipx9,I think the most important thing I can tell you is dont be afraid of making a big deal about this. This is important. If youve been experiencing thoughts or compulsions towards suicide thats very important to talk to someone about. Even if you feel safe about it right now that can change suddenly and without much warning. Even if it doesnt and even if you arent clinically depressed the thoughts that youre experiencing are clearly having a big impact on you. Thats justification enough to seek out help.Im not sure how exactly GPs handle things in Australia but when I had concerns about depression I told my doctor that I felt like I might be dealing with depression or anxiety. They gave me an evaluation and we moved from there. I would expect that it would be similar for you  most doctors should be trained in how to respond to that kind of concern and should have a procedure to follow.,MyLittleSupportGroup,d3fhidu,4,t5_2u1cu
