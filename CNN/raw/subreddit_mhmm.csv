Trollope understood that redefinitions of the norm can cut both ways bold tax reductions seen as reckless in Eisenhowers day were made by Ronald Reagan into expected electoral loot for the wealthy. The sexism of  is now hard to imagine but so are its top marginal tax rates. In Phineas Redux Mr.Felix is forced to live by his wits on the Continent. Nevertheless a certain class of dishonesty dishonesty magnificent in its proportions and climbing into high places has become at the same time so rampant and so splendid that there seems to be reason for fearing that men and women will be taught to feel that dishonesty if it can become splendid will cease to be abominable. Marie s feelings for Felix soon change from love to hatred. When Longestaffe and his son demand the purchase money for the estate Melmotte had bought from them Melmotte forges his daughter s name to a document that will allow him to get at her money money that Melmotte had put in her name precisely to protect it from creditors and which Marie refused to give back to him.Her close friend Mr Broune a newspaper publisher reviews her books favourably because of his regard for her and clearly wants their relationship to be closer. At his gambling club Felix hears his friends say that Melmotte s daughter Marie will have a huge dowry. Returning home he impulsively tells his mother that he will try to retrieve the family s fortunes by marrying Marie. When the Carburys are invited to a grand ball given at Melmotte s Grosvenor Square mansion Felix an experienced ladies man meets Marie a trusting and inexperienced girl and sweeps her off her feet.His dialogue and sense of drama makes his characters breathe if he lacks the grand bowwow strain and language of Dickens his ear for the way real people speak is impeccable. Violet Effingham whom Phineas pursues out of a mixture of lust and social ambition rejects him reluctantly in favor of a man more reliably of her own class and tastes. Trollope could portray almost as wide a social range as Dickens and his sympathy for women is unexpected and delicate his bluff manner conceals something more subtle. Amanda Craig s new novel Hearts and Minds  is published by Little Brown. The Duke s Children AnneMarie Duff Georgiana Longestaffe Oliver Ford Davies Mr Longestaffe Joanna David Lady Pomona Longestaffe Maxine Peake Ruby Ruggles Trevor Peacock Mr RugglesMelmotte then also forges Croll s signature but makes the mistake of leaving the documents with Mr Brehgert a banker. When Brehgert returns the documents to Croll rather than to Melmotte Croll discovers the forgery and leaves Melmotte s service. With his creditors now knocking at his door the railway shares nearly worthless charges of forgery looming in his future and his political reputation in tatters after a drunken appearance in the House of Commons Melmotte poisons himself. The remainder of the novel ties up the loose ends. While Felix is out with Ruby one evening John Crumb comes upon them and believing that Felix is forcing his attentions on her thoroughly beats Felix..   ,mhmm,cxecm3l,1,t5_2vcwd
