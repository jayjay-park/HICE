1670108,0,t3_2dhpx2,Does each building have a unique subnet? If so it would make more sense to enter the IP and have logic to figure out everything else. If you are using complex subnets maybe even specify the CIDR. ie entering ... assigns all specifics to building .,usefulscripts,cjpogek,1,t5_2vk96

2737322,0,t3_2reqml,Hi Ive written something similar but in regards to stopping the system shut down to make sure the users have signed there time card on Fridays. From what I understand the system responds to a wm query endsession message by calling wmendsession on all processes. So you could have a message box pop up and ask if the user is active. If not then send wmquery end session. I would like to b say more but Im at the dmv and will be called soon. Heres further reading ,usefulscripts,cnf7zo6,2,t5_2vk96

5887054,0,t3_3vvxmo,Not bad but I would replace the file with this variable    file  envUSERPROFILEDocumentswhosloggedinGetDate.ToStringyyyyMMdd.csvAnd use that throughout the script.    WriteOutput line | OutFile file Append Encoding ASCIIIf Im logged into a server at a client and want to run this I dont want to create folders off the root of C thats bad practice. Better to put it in your documents or a network share. Better yet parameterize it with a default.Heres a slightly different way of doing it same results but it makes use of ExportCsv and PSObject which is more flexible if you want to manipulate the results later. Also I like to time my scripts. And suppress error messages. And launch the output file when finished. And make sure the required modules are loaded.
