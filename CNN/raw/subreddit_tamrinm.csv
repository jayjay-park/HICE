4364395,0,t1_cshink7,He definitely wont be involved in season  but unfortunately for me because as much as I love Stiles the Sheriff and some of the other characters S was a huge letdown for me and I expect S to be the same I can see him staying for SB. I suspect FOX pushing back the premiere date for The Death Cure indicates that they worked out a way with MTV for Dylan to do it since unless anything else is announced he only has one more project to film once hes done with promotion for The Scorch Trials in September. He could film B then and then go straight to TDC filming and Wes amp Co. would still have time to shape the film they work pretty quickly.This is a podcast blog for the show run by longtime fans. In this series of posts theyre speculating on some parts but everything said here sounds pretty logical and it actually ends up being informative.

4365031,0,t1_cshm34k,Yeah but I dont think its clear yet if they did it because of Dylans schedule or because they need extra time for postproduction.

We are starting to get a lot of information overload with TST press junket so be careful about repeating a link someone else has already shared. Just take a look at some of the other posts before you post yours and see if its already been mentioned. I know sometimes it happens because people are posting at the same time but it shouldnt happen if it was posted an hour apart. When you post a link always give a description with it. Its always good to know what the context is first sometimes its not obvious. Use a critical eye when posting a funny picturememe of Dylan OBrien. If its about him or his projects its ok. But if its about someone else then it becomes about that person or event and the post goes off topic.,tamrinm,culv0qz,2,t5_38srp

5398279,0,t3_3avpop, actors who should play a young John McClane in Die Hard  from the ludicrous to the even more ludicrous | Digital SpyIts written tongue in cheek but he and Taron Egerton are pointed out as the more serious suggestions. Well they say Taron Egerton is. Im choosing to believe the like Egerton makes Dylan one too. P. Excerptsgt Whether you like it or not Die Hard  is happening. Whats worse its going to be a prequel and a sequel at the same time which means we need a freshfaced actor to play a young John McClane.gt With the original Die Hard set in  and Die Hard  set in part in   get ready for McClane as a rookie New York cop  were looking for someone in their early s. Or are we?gt Prepare yourself for some of the silliest casting suggestions ever made as we point out how Bruce Williss John McClane really is a oneofakind motherfker.gt Taron Egerton Because hes already got two franchises on the go  Kingsman and now Robin Hood Origins  so hes used to the Hollywood sequel machine. Also hes got the right stature and a good jaw. We may have accidentally made a decent suggestion here. Hmm. gt Dylan OBrien Because like Egerton hes so hot right now with The Maze Runner trilogy under his belt and the Teen Wolf TV series on the go.

If I remember right or understand right Kant said the person did a moral thing because he knew its right then he was more moral than the person did it in instinct but not thought about it. And I totally agree with him. In my opinion emotions are very changeable but the moral code is more steady. That why I always think Stiles wouldnt go to the dark way because it did against his moral code. Stiles will not hurt innocent people at his will under any circumstances.And if you call his less enthusiast for strangers dark side then most people have this dark side. He knows he should help the others and he did helped them even if he felt opposite then he is a good person.But I somehow afraid the TW writers though. I think they want to push Stiles to a dark way since B and they still didnt give up this idea. I dont think they know what is precious about Stiles so they may ruin him more.

I was a little worried because I read they had reshoots in September not with Dylan but if theyre giving it the IMAX treatment theyre at least betting on it.Also I allowed myself a little smugness at reading this Divergent is the most successful franchise launched since The Hunger Games with the first two Divergent films grossing nearly  million at the global box office. First because thats a lie sugarbuns. And second directly related to that because the actual most successful franchise after THG i.e. The Maze Runner is almost at the M mark currently .

I dont see how that cemented how much you dont like the movie. The real issues with Man of Steel were the pacing lack of interesting characters and a glaring tone that didnt seem to fit Superman. On top of that since most of the movie was boring they felt the to over compensate in the third act and bombard us with an action sequence that was  minutes long. It felt like Michael Bay directed the last act of the movie.But with Batman V Superman Ben Afflecks creative team wrote the movie. Ben Affleck is starring as Batman.

I repeat though that I dont have a problem with it.So DM me if you want or just share with the class lol Were all adults here.gt As for marijuana for anxiety. I dont know anything about either thing. But I would think if he did have anxiety that had to have a prescription that it would have to be pretty strong. It seems that would make it difficult to do what he does especially the press stuff.Haha I really didnt explain myself. I mean that in case he has to get it with a prescription then the excuse so to speak would probably be that right? Like if a doctor prescribes it then they can exaggerate but not make stuff up. But like I said I have no idea. Its not legal here so I only have a vague idea of how it would work.gt It seems that would make it difficult to do what he does especially the press stuff.I dont think at all he even CAN get high on a daily basis. It would be impossible for him to do his job both on and off set. Well unless its a brand that doesnt have hallucinogenic effects?

7113805,0,t1_d1lsx6w,I finally got to watch them all! Fun look back to the first yearsFirst of all the MTV Comic Con branding throughout the videos were super annoying. But anyways....gtLOL at this entire segment. Jeff nobody likes you. And of course he perks up by a kid putting together a video. I love that he still had a passion for his youtube life. He was really honored that someone remembered him from that and not Teen Wolf. I hope he had a chance to talk to that person.gtThis one is kind of a mess and that man was kind of patronizing but eh whatever its still fun and I love how one of the women is like WITH THAT FACE? And cute appearance by a wild Liz York!Oh man that guy was giving off what have I sunk to? vibes. But I absolutely loved this because the more he was a jerk to Dylan the more sarcastic Dylan was back to him. Like when he forced the werewolfsexuality issue. I died at Dylans long drawn out answer to him that was basically a repeat of ok. The reporter really deserved that lol.,tamrinm,d1mquv1,1,t5_38srp
7174089,0,t1_d1tm51p,. Heart Monitor. That was a story told by director Toby Wilkins whose first thing to say about Dylan was that it was one of the best experiences working with him and he was amazing. Then he went on to say they have the same type of humor Dylan has perfect comedic timing and then what you recall. He naturally felt the end of the scenes could feel the moment hanging and added a little improv to tie it up but Wilkins had to tell him to stop because he wanted to leave the moment hanging and cut there haha,tamrinm,d1tmkp2,1,t5_38srp

7367434,0,t1_d2f8hyw,gt Im glad you included those first two quotes because Ive seen countless times people saying for whatever reasons ahem you know how it usually goes that Dylan gets his way because hes the favorite. And no weve seen so many quotes proving that he actually gets his way WHEN he gets it because hes just fucking good. Hes got great instincts and sometimes those instincts are better than what the writers and directors had in mind. agree I get so tired of people saying that Dylan gets to do whatever he wants because hes Jeffs favorite when we hear time and time again about how he does a TON of improv and changing things up and we only get to see a small portion of it. Its just a numbers game honestly you know the idea of take a hundred shots youll hit something. And it sounds like Dylan is just brave enough to put it all out there when a lot of other actors dont. Which is fine its not a criticism of the others but I just hate seeing it used against Dylan when its really a huge point in his favor.,tamrinm,d2fmk1a,1,t5_38srp
7550889,0,t1_d30gci3,Well even if we dont like it there are certain factions in the Middle East that are at definite odds with the U.S. and a lot of other countries too including the ones theyre in. Who else is a spy thriller going to use as the socalled enemy?  Back in the s it was always Russia and people really didnt have a problem with that.  You cant have a spy thriller without an international enemy.  Just because there are bad guys doesnt mean that the whole region is seen as bad.  Especially considering the current situation over in the Middle East  there are many many good people stuck in a horrible situation thats why theyre fleeing.  I mean if the bad guys are like ISILtype people they certainly dont represent the whole region and they certainly dont represent Islam.,tamrinm,d30i087,3,t5_38srp

7711599,0,t1_d3hx0cr,I havent done any research but the part that stands out to me in the discussion of Dylans casting is that Rapp is supposed to blend in seamlessly in the Middle East. A character who disappears into his surroundings and assumes different identities is interesting to me.But they will have to invest him with some core personality as well. At least we know Dylan is good at fleshing out underwritten characters from what he did with Thomas who I gather people liked less in the books.,tamrinm,d3ir9bp,2,t5_38srp
7738019,0,t1_d3lqs7g,Mhmm I think they face an uphill battle in terms of making the movie if that is indeed their plan. With Rosa landing a new role Dylan landing a new role and older actors like Giancarlo and Patricia who tend to be in high demand I think itll be hard for them to find a time where everyone is free enough to film TDC.But who knows what will happen.,tamrinm,d3lr8rj,1,t5_38srp
7751454,0,t1_d3n9dg5,Yeah I think they will be there. They kind of have to to keep interest in the show. But Dylan wont be there. And like Tyler Hoechlin at Paleyfest last year they will have to address what his involvement in s is. The audience isnt stupid dont look at me like that they really arent they know his injury alone has kept him from filming and they will have to address that. At least if they were smart they would.I actually picture this happening.Moderator I understand you have a big announcement to make.Audience sits forward in their seats looking for an announcement of s like every other year at comic con.Jeff Davis I do.....I spoke to MTV just now.

7769341,0,t1_d3p9sme,Well Ill bet that the legal stuff isnt finished actually. It can take years. However even the legal stuff shouldnt prevent them from making a statement saying somethin like  Dylan is recoveringrecovered and is looking forward to his current and upcoming projects  or something. I suppose they cant announce AmAs until CBS Films does but they could make it clear that hes not going to be inactive for a year. or  maybe he is and were all wrong.

7918230,0,t1_d45upvg,I was hoping he was in training for AmAs too but now Ill join the worriers.  Its very upsetting that so many fans are hounding his family and friends.  When hes ready hell go back to work.  He may or may not make a statement.  They cant force him to do something before hes ready.  I hate the silence too but I respect his right to privacy.

8657166,0,t3_4omdpk,Owkay so I wanted to throw this little hot potato in the group because in the next weeks Im pretty sure that some TW fans will become pissed off at Dylan for working on AmAs. Im leaving out the TMR fans for now because most of them know that Kaya is pregnant and the movie will start up again next year. I can hear the questions arising What about TW B? What about Stiles?Well I think its safe to say that Stiles will get his farewell in season A and will not be talked about again in B. Unless Dylan can clone himself I dont see this happening. Even the socalled two weeks in October might be a big problem. And then were not even talking about promotion for DWH. And since theyre shooting AmAs for three months and TDC will start up again in January and the kid needs some rest now and then I dont see this happening.And who knows when theyll announce another movie deal .So how will the fans react?,tamrinm,d6nreli,4,t5_38srp
