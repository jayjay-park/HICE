2345611,0,t3_2m7isi,This is not good at all. We have always been strapped for commitments to begin with. Now guys are reacting negatively to the product or lack thereof on the field. I was very excited to get these . Back to square one now. Rhoads MUST figure out a way to get some solid recruits or find a way to coach up the ones we do get. Or his next season could be cut short. Losing tough big  games is one thing but a lack of recruiting is a much larger problem.,cyclONEnation,cm1mni8,2,t5_30z80
2352209,0,t1_cm2fk71,Gotcha! Someone posted a link over on rcollegebasketball for this site in particular. When Ive scoured for streaming links just googling live sports streaming free will give you some results. Be wary of where you go. Lots of that stuff is virus filled. But if you have spent any amount of time on those sites usually you can tell whats going to be shady. Adthe is another good site. ,cyclONEnation,cm2fzt3,1,t5_30z80
2378419,0,t1_cm5ohcm,He had a couple moments in the first half where he was greedy but really changed it up in the second.  Had a good game and played solid defense.  Once we put him on their star player the game broke wide open.,cyclONEnation,cm5oj7m,5,t5_30z80

3237032,0,t3_2x74sx,Felt like we would win the game the entire time until about  minutes left. We just could not hit shots late. Damn.Hoiberg said it well didnt play with urgency.,cyclONEnation,coxix2p,3,t5_30z80
3253845,0,t3_2xdqpx,What do the Celtics have to lose they have almost no one good on their team... Give him another shot! I dont have any State players to track in the NBA anymore,cyclONEnation,coz9s1p,2,t5_30z80
3255643,0,t3_2xdlqn,gtThe biggest cheers come at Hilton. His mother can hear them when she watches games back home.  My mother is real excited about that Tsalmpouris said. She says like The people love you you have to stay there. Listen to your mother Georgios,cyclONEnation,cozgi64,2,t5_30z80

5175186,0,t1_cv9mpxt,Yeah because hes really trying hard. His play calling has been complete shit. Like I said before we have incredible athletes for receivers. Sam could close his eyes and throw it backwards and one of our receivers would probably come down with it. But instead hes been calling the same shitty WR screen to zero effect. Our offense had like  yards in the second half of the Iowa game. Some offensive genius alright. ,cyclONEnation,cv9st9k,-1,t5_30z80
5741533,0,t3_3tqi8f,Welcome to Cyclone football. You guys must be new here.  years and counting. Its definitely time to start from scratch. We got the quarterback. We got the wide receiver. We got the running back. We got the fans. Its time to give thanks and bid good luck and farewell to Coach.,cyclONEnation,cx8sjwk,3,t5_30z80
