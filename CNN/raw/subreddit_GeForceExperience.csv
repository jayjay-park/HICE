9101526,0,t3_54rlwz,Im not sure if this helps you at all but I have a g and use push to talk with overwatch and shadowplay.  I used the logitech software for the mouse to change one of the mouse buttons to the  key and then have that mapped in overwatch for push to talk.  In terms of only having that in shadowplay and not in game sorry idk.,GeForceExperience,d85uvru,1,t5_3f9u7

Other than that the quality depends on the bitrate you set it to so they are virtually the same in that regard.OBS has always been better than shadowplay it just requires more setup.,GeForceExperience,df1vbq0,2,t5_3f9u7
