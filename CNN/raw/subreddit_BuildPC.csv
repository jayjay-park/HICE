4589618,0,t3_3duiko,Common mistake is you have the locked CPU and an unlocked motherboard. Unlocked CPUs end in K. Unlocked mobos start with Z. Locked mobos start with H. Anyways. Do you plan on overclocking?If so youll need to go with the k. If not. You can get a H and save a little money. Based on the liquid cooler Im thinking youre gonna overclock so better get the k. ,BuildPC,ct948v0,2,t5_2xgps
