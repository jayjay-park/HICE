2919323,0,t3_2teazd,I thought it was the best episode of the week. Larrys finally hitting his stride and the panel discussion was good  and apparently they kept going even after the TV segment ended. Ive definitely enjoyed what Ive seen of the show and I look forward to it getting even better as they work out the kinks.,nightlyshow,cnzxp2v,1,t5_34p2d

3262803,0,t1_cozzpd4,I agree with a lot of what you said like how Larry still needs to work things over but at least hes good at starting conversations how Thursdays episode is getting more flak than it deserves that was actually a good conversation and I agree with a lot of what was said and quite a bit on your black comedy is dead bit. However there is plenty I disagree with.gt I think some of the topics he covers dont have a right or wrong answer to it and he tries to help viewers form their own opinions.I disagree completely. There is HUGE bias in a lot of his discussions even if he tries to let other sides have talking points. In the Vaccine debate there was OBVIOUSLY a wrong side to this. Its like the Global Warming debate where choosing to do nothing is worse than doing what is best for the community. In the Money in Politics discussion there were some issues discussed that had obvious wrong answers. These are just some examples but worse is Larrys monologues where he obviously takes a side in an issue before allowing his panel to discuss it which can introduce some bias.So I disagree with you saying Larry covers topics without the bias of right of wrong. People can still form their own opinions though. That will never change.gt Is Larry being racist? No more racist than every other TV show out there.Thats not necessarily a good thing. Larry isnt being racist for the sake of irony or to demonstrate anything more than just trying to get a laugh. Most of his racism seems to come from ignorance rather than comedy. gt The difference is that instead of black people white people are the ones being talked about it in a negative light.Hes being racist against black people way more than any other people. Just because youre black talking about black people doesnt mean youre not racist. Id be perfectly fine with Larrys racism if he was equally racist to other skin colors or cultures. Racism is something that has always and will always exist in this world. Its how we deal with it that matters. gt Black comedy only is deemed funny if black people can be laughed at. If we talk about the fears and negatives of white people its suddenly not funny. While it is pretty true what was said about black comedy I disagree with your additional point about how if we make fun of while people suddenly its not funny. This returns to my previous point. The issue here isnt that Larry is being racist towards white people its that hes being racist towards black people a lot more so than white or any other.gt I think Larry used sexist points to start conversation so the black women can debunk them. Like the myth that black women are bossy he said that and then they went into conversation. Okay youre pretty much spot on here. However Larry still seems rather ignorant at times even if he does it to get a conversation going. Theres a balance to these things.gt This show is going to have a different brand of humor and a different view point. Race will always be a topic.A different brand of humor and finding race problems in everything isnt necessarily a good thing. We didnt have to talk about racism on Mars but we did. We didnt have to talk about racism on Fat Acceptance but we did. We didnt have to talk about racism on Gay Marriage but we did. There is a time and place to talk about everything and racism absolutely needs plenty of time and places to be discussed. But not all the time. Not every place.,nightlyshow,cp0790v,2,t5_34p2d
3462473,0,t1_cpi7nxt,I agree with most of your points and I agree with the former senators points and that the comedians were killing discussion with their pointless comments but being fair his comments were off topic. I know they were related and that it is a good point but the show is too short to try and tackle both topic even if they are related. Overall I think Id prefer less comedians unless they are also informed on the topic and limit their jokes. Maybe Im asking for too much. ,nightlyshow,cpmy3ku,1,t5_34p2d

5271496,0,t3_3mtfwh,Jeb  Modern victim movements have steadily...  Larry Well back in s...  You dont get to jump back about  years to make your point when Jeb is talking about modern groups steadily using victimization tactics to gain power. Jeb is right too. Its very obvious today with claims like how Mike Brown is still a victim or how women make  or less cents for every dollar. Claims that have been debunked but persist.  And I really dont want to go on a rant about Larrys comment at the end of the first segment. But wow. He has to work twice as hard for half as much. It sounds like hes claiming to be four times the comedian and host when compared to other white ones that we know and love. ,nightlyshow,cvlhr7b,2,t5_34p2d

7255662,0,t1_d22mby3,gt Have you considered that people voted for Arnold not because they actually liked his policies but because they were upset with Davis for things out of his control and they simply thought that Arnold was cool? Also are you saying that there was even more voter fraud in the following election where Arnold won again? arnold could not have won because the people would not have voted for him....   it was a problem in the voting process... the machines the counts the disappearance of ballots..  Democratic california would never have voted for arnie because he was cool partly because arnie is NOT cool and everyone knows it lol... at least most people in california know it... hes a hunk of meat who can memorize simple scripts... and also californians would not have voted for anyone just because they were cool...   many folks seem to think californians are spacey surfers stoned on pot or whatever...  but that mellowness is just a Style... we californians can be very bright!so! briefly californians do not vote for people because they are cool and arnie is not coolbtw what is cool? lol oh and the second election where arnie won again?  like gw bush did? lol cmon... if they can steal an election when they are not in the seat of power... how much easier is it to do the second time?,nightlyshow,d22x0ti,0,t5_34p2d
