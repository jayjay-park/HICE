9825450,0,t3_5fu56b,at el Volcan Leon needs to score at least  and can receive  more goals. They just need  in the first half and another one in second half I think its doable for Boselli and them if they really want it. I love how Burdisso died in the game he just keeps going he was bleeding but he took it like a champ. ,LaFiera,dao9zfo,2,t5_37ilr
10761571,0,t3_5tsvmm,He looked promising but I think he didnt adapt well. Then again Leon hasnt had a consistent coach for awhile now. Pizza who is now the head coach of Chile brought him to the team. If he would have stayed longer maybe Maxi could have kept a starting spot but thats all speculation. I do like his technical ability with the ball. He can make some hard turns and cut players pretty good.,LaFiera,ddpz5zk,2,t5_37ilr
