It is like a crash course to diving you do not get certified but you dive in the pool for training and a one tank trip to shallow reef in the ocean.  Just note for SCUBA diving you cannot fly for  hours after diving...since you are only doing one dive and it will be shallow you would probably be fine with  hours.Snorkel Trip . per personDiscover Scuba . per person,fortlauderdale,ch8d1jx,2,t5_2s494

2602892,0,t1_cmy4t79,First thing you need to learn when renting in South Florida is that TWO real estate agents make a commission whenever contracts are signed here the owners real estate agent and the renters real estate agent This means that lots of real estate agents will want to show you properties and for many of them their main concern will be getting you to choose quickly so that they can get a check.  Then youll have lots of guys on craigslist and other sites posting fake ads so they can take you around to real properties which they have absolutely nothing to do with.  Theyll even take you to corporate apartment communities the ones with onsite rental staff.  You could just call those places on your own.  Beware...and reverse image search everything on you see online before calling anybody.  I see a few of the vultures have already hit you up in this thread alone.  Good luck with your potential move.  ,fortlauderdale,cmyc3hc,2,t5_2s494

9157672,0,t3_55qhtl,I understand better safe than sorry but as someone who has lived in Florida for a combined  years  you are putting the cart before the horse.  First off  theres no reason to evacuate yet.  While we are in the cone  most models keep the storm off shore to our east.  Thats important  because the worst part of a hurricane is the west side of the eye.  You need to wait at least until the pm Tuesday model to see if the storm jogs or shifts. If it follows the models right now youd be evacuating for mph gusts and rain  thats like a bad thunderstorm.  Second  lets play out your fear  that this is a direct hit of a hurricane with mph winds anything less really doesnt matter Where are you going? South?  North?  West?  You dont know where the hurricane is going so you need to wait to see where to go.  Obviously the best bet is west to Naples or North to Orlando but  again  you need to wait to see which is the better choice.  Chances are it will do nothing and head out to sea.  Yeah  this is years of  misses talking but Ive been thorough  really bad storms.  All you can do is hope for the best and  prepare for the worst ,fortlauderdale,d8csvpi,33,t5_2s494
