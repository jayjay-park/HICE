1566316,0,t1_cjbz914,gtit allowed an older audience to relate to the show as well.This is even more necessary now with vast numbers of older fans of BMW tuning in to GMW for the sake of nostalgia. I cant believe they didnt tailor the show to account for this. It really should have been the number one priority for them in order to maximize viewers and therefore profits. It really bothers me that people say Well GMW is a show for kids. What did you expect? when I complain about the plots of the show. Just because its a kids show doesnt mean it has to be boring for adults! There were a number of family shows in the s and s that were enjoyable for younger and older viewers alike. ,GirlMeetsWorld,cjcm0g6,3,t5_2vnks
1633123,0,t3_2c3nmy,I like the show a lot but if it were me I wouldtone down Farkle. Hes too over the top. Lucas so far is a blank slate with no personality. Theres zero chemistry with him and Riley so I hope they either phase him out or make him interesting fast. Cory needs to either have more control over his class or make his lack of control a bigger issue.Possibly by having another person help him see how much of a problem it is.  Right now they have students practically interrupting him and he doesnt even acknowledge it.  The sets are too colorful. In the original series I had no idea they werent in actual locations most of the time. I have a harder time suspending disbelief with the current sets.The clothes dont bother me as much as I thought it would but I would try to give maya a bit more normal clothes. Especially since she seems to come from a lower income family. She shouldnt have access to designer stuff.  Some more adults for Cory and Topanga to interact with would be nice. And this might be nitpicky but Mayas scatting is a bit cringe inducing. That and that ewwewewewew thing she does. ,GirlMeetsWorld,cjl0qga,4,t5_2vnks

2854629,0,t1_cns74t7,gt And I feel bad for the actor playing Lucas given hes a child actor whos main character is being the pretty face on the show and being constantly reminded of that. Its really fucking creepy how much the adults fawn over him.  Hes what?  ?  Pretty all of the adults are constantly practically hitting on him.,GirlMeetsWorld,cnsklnw,2,t5_2vnks

5357659,0,t1_cvwhecw,I fully  agree.Topanga has had a jarring and awkward amount as in little of screen time but she DID have an actual adult problem with her law firm trying to close the bakery and her eventually getting in touch with her true self and taking over.  It wasnt super well done but it was early on in the show.  Totally insignificant character otherwise though.Corey has been much more prominently featured but never as his own person.  I understand that having kids changes your priorities but Corey doesnt seem to have any semblance of a life or problems outside of the classroom and grading Mayas homework.  Both could use something anything on their own to make them interesting.  Shawn and Erics stories have been interesting Erics is goofy but so is Eric and also I think its SO funny that hes a Senator now so the writers are capable.  Im sure the priority has been giving the nonstarring OG characters interesting arcs since Corey and Topanga are in every episode regardless.However the writers have been super bad at managing time and pacing. Theyve gotten so much better as of late but its still a problem.  Because of the recent trend upwards I have faith theyll eventually fix it.  Like I said I understand that your life and priorities change after having kids but come on!!,GirlMeetsWorld,cvwi2i9,5,t5_2vnks

5432727,0,t1_cw62j9a,On a serious note I think Maya has already shown some signs of depression throughout the show. She pretty much grew up believing that she somehow doesnt deserve a stable family or to do well in school or for her talents especially her art to be appreciated.So imagine what will happen when she gets the idea that the only reason she has a chance with Lucas is because Riley gifted her an opportunity she doesnt deserve.Thats why the next episode GM Forgiveness is so important in my mind. Its more about Maya forgiving herself and letting herself believe that the bad things in her life arent her fault.,GirlMeetsWorld,cw633ey,-1,t5_2vnks
5497566,0,t3_3pz14a,In my opinion its kind of annoying that Maya has been getting everything she wants. She wants Shawn as a dad so everyone has to force that to happen. She wants Corys little bro as a boyfriend so she follows him around and makes everyone try to make that happen for her. Now she is trying to get Lucas and she is abusing her best friend relationship in order to get what she wants. She knows that Riley does whatever to make her friends happy and shes taking advantage of that in order to get with Lucas. Riley didnt even see Lucas as a brother until Maya pretended to be Riley it was Maya who first said that she sees Lucas as a brother. All her master plan. So I can see why she is sad Riley trying to do what she think is right but deep inside it hurts her. ,GirlMeetsWorld,cwed6su,1,t5_2vnks

5895849,0,t3_3vcizh,I love how Farkle has grown. I originally thought hed be Miknus part  but hes become such an insightful and important character. I was silently applauding when he answered Harpers question with sense and sensibility. Shows how wellrounded of a genius he really is. He doesnt just come up with these insane equations and experiments but also can dole out advice on life. While I personally wouldnt have said to Riley the whole blowing the horn at midnight thing I can understand why he feels he needs to.

7777230,0,t1_d3pzepy,Actually Riley does know what a bull is. She described it as a boy cow. She knew what it was because she had seen farms on tv. A boy cow is called a bull a girl cow is called a cow a baby cow is called a calf.But Riley and Maya and Farkle are city kids. They havent seen anything larger than a racoon that was a wild animal and likely nothing bigger than a large dog in real life.They simply cant comprehend the hugeness of a bull because they have no experience with it.Consider all those tourists who risk their necks trying to get pictures of bison or bears at Yellowstone. ,GirlMeetsWorld,d3q7h23,4,t5_2vnks
