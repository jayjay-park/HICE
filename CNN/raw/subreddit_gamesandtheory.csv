2040097,0,t1_ckz45k7,As far as exploiting a misunderstanding where by people think you are someone you are not where at no point you will be lying. It is best to articulate a situation where you are unlikely to be directly asked to confirm your identity.Thus you wont lie and confirm the misunderstanding or be honest and undo your work.This can be done either by exploiting legal or ethical responsibility where someone should not know who you are this is especially possible in Asian culture where maintaining face and politeness is key.while I was in Japan my personal translator was under the impression I dont know why P that I was European nobility that wanted to maintain a low profile. In an effort to present Japan as positively as possible she told people with out my say so or my permission that I was European nobility. I enjoyed the full benefits of celebrity status I enjoyed free meals comfortable seating and accommodation favourable attention all round. my personal translator in this instance acted as my proxy to great benefit the cost of a personal translator was less then the cost of the gains I had received from the misunderstanding. ,gamesandtheory,ckz53uh,2,t5_33krz
