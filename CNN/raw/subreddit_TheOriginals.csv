In Casket Girls it was nice to see Rebekah take the lead but for the rest of her stint she didnt seem to have the agency that the character is capable of which is the fault of the writers. Hayley was a fun character on The Vampire Diaries but her leadership of the werewolf pack is coming off a bit forced to me and her manipulation of Elijah seems to be more of a result of Elijah being weak than Hayley being strong.,TheOriginals,cgb6sew,1,t5_2w11q

2186879,0,t3_2k2ph4,Yeah for sure. In season one I felt bad for her because she was this sixteen year old girl who was scared out of her mind trapped with this power she couldnt control and stuck in between a clash of her people and her friendsprotectors. It was interesting and emotional and tragic. Then the Harvest Ritual was completed and they didnt handle that as well as they could have. Now shes just this normal frankly not super bright witch whose primary connection to the plot is that Marcel has grown attached to her and wants to keep her safe. She isnt a super powerful secret weapon anymore no one is out to get her etc.. So my guess is that the writers will just use her the way they do everyone who they run out of plot lines for but they dont want to kill off have her routinely kidnapped and used to threaten her allies into cooperating with stuff. Meh.Its a problem that I was really hoping didnt carry over from TVD. They get this ensemble cast together and instead of whittling it down to the most interesting so that they can make room for other interesting guest character arcs they just try so hard to have everyone doing something and make excuses for them to never really die even if theyre boring or useless. Which means that you can have a kickass guest star on but theyll be defeated in two episodes because otherwise they wouldnt have time to introduce Boring Girl s new plot that no one cares about.Not that they cant figure their shit out but their track record isnt great. On TVD once a character got boring they pretty much just stayed boring. Caroline is the exception.,TheOriginals,clht00g,5,t5_2w11q

They HAVE to be to become what they are.  Theyve managed to make just about every NAMED werewolf a poor accidental killer cursed only by an unfortunate happenstance but honestly given their anger management issues we have to accept that the vast majority have have actually committed murder.This is one of those cases I think where the writers REALLY wish they could go back and change the lore.  The whole murder activates the curse thing worked when werewolves were rare nearly hunted into extinction and hiding in small little groups that had to find each other.Now that the Originals has expanded them into huge extended families with bloodlines and lineages it paints a REALLY unpleasant picture.  ,TheOriginals,d20epbe,5,t5_2w11q

9631248,0,t3_5clwog,Marcel was a great character yes. In controle and playing on his wits. His rage against the mackelsons was justified even klaus knew it. I just watched the last few episodes again today and my biggest problem is the hoard of vampires marcel invites to destroy the city and paint the streets red. Those vampires didnt add any value at all. They just yelled and destroyed. Marcel did the talking. Marcel decided klaus his fate. The hoard only added destruction to the town marcel said to love so much. Vincent his final speech nailed it. Everything that made marcel a great character was destroyed in that last episode just to make room for another monster. Concequences be damned,TheOriginals,da08zdg,3,t5_2w11q

11185141,0,t3_5zo3o7,She chose him over Marcel every time. So. Marcel chose himself and power over her many times. At least Kol was willing to die for Davina. Marcel handed her over to Klaus like a trophy in season  and sabotaged her multiple times for his own self preservation.And its not an obsession. She loved him he loved her. They are the only ones who treated each other like equals and didnt use one another all the time.,TheOriginals,deztmot,21,t5_2w11q

11310941,1,t1_dfe0u93,First of all I hated Davina and Kolvina was so cringy to me so Im more than cool with Davina being dead.Yeah the Mikaelsons are not heroes or victims and I root for them especially for Klaus and the part I enjoy the most is when he goes into this evil ruthless mode. I loved when he killed Tim and almost Davina I loved  every part when he fought his family on s finale and a lot of moments like that. People a lot of times get fucked up when protagonists  heros Marcel is not a hero either but whatever.Its also funny how Marcel talks like the Mikaelsons never showed Mercy to him lmao how many times  has he stood against them and went out alive?And btw i really wanted to see Klaus transformed into wolf vs Marcel it would be one hell of a fight such a shame,TheOriginals,dfe2t5c,0,t5_2w11q

11333541,0,t1_dffhqw4,I dont know about quitting a show because your favorite dies. Ive always found that theres always an unexpected favorite waiting to be discovered once someone gets killed or written off the show. Take TVD for example. Everyone thought the show would be shit because she wasnt there but I actually liked it because it gave new focus to characters who have been there all along but have been overshadowed by Elena. And it took the show in a new direction because every plot line didnt necessarily involve saving Elena loving Elena all things Elena as Rose once said . ,TheOriginals,dfgmy9v,1,t5_2w11q

11380238,0,t1_dffhlqe,How is being pissed about your family betraying you behaving like a wounded child? And honestly he saw his father defending the man that murdered him in cold blood. I dont care who your are that type of resentment is gonna stick with you for a long time. A lot longer than it did with Marcel because as we can see he pretty much told them all to fluff off.You guys try so hard to play down how this could have turned out as if it was simply going to be him killing Elijah and Freya. He kills them and leaves the rest unharmed. Then what? And dont speak to me about moral compasses because I never said torturing anybody was okay. Keep your words in your own mouth please and thank you.,TheOriginals,dflxipe,2,t5_2w11q

11607378,0,t3_65mze1,The thing about any vampire fighting an original is that any vampire can be killed with little more than a heart extraction which is pretty easy for an original. The fact that originals can not be killed means that all vampires have very little chance if the originals are truly trying to kill them.In the first episode of the originals we know that Rebekah killed an entire pile of Marcels guys with no effort.,TheOriginals,dgbpfky,6,t5_2w11q
