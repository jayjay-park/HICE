5176191,0,t1_cv9wrsm,In answer to your questions EoC was a change to the game mechanic of runescape where you no longer had a style of combat of afk attacking. Eoc brought the idea of an interactive combat system meant to make the combat experience more challenging. Overrides are bought through microtransactions where you can hide what you are actually wearing by having these. In RS this isnt too much of a problem as it doesnt matter if you can see what other gear people are using. However in Darkscape the environment of PvP all the time would be greatly affected if overrides were permitted and people could cover their gear with cosmetics. Teleporting was changed greatly with the release of Lodestones. These provided people the ability to teleport to major locationscitys for no cost the idea of paying for teletabs and runes to teleport was no longer a thought. Runescape has always been fp but only in Darkscape is the entire game fp. The only difference between fp and pp in Darkscape is the amount of bonus xp given and bank space provided.,RSDarkscape,cv9x69o,3,t5_39we1
5177493,0,t1_cva2m5f,If people can kill you with one item then they win. One iteming should  be absolutely fine. I agree with fixing the one item suiciding at banks but outside of that if somebody with one item beats you? Tough luck the game is risky. EDITAlsogtIntroduce a system where if players get multiple kills in a short amount of time say five in five minutes they get a special sort of skull. If they get killed while they have this skull theyre given the same jail treatment as you would getting killed by a guard. This would get rid of people killing other people over and over again near a respawn area for combat EXP.  Pretty sure this doesnt target people that dont risk. This targets anyone that kills people.Again the first one does this. If you die to a guard when skulled you get put in jail this targets everyone skulled not just one itemers.   Neither of these methods are a good fix.,RSDarkscape,cva2t4x,-8,t5_39we1

5183041,0,t3_3lzqv4,You enter a dungeon this dungeon has  floors. As you gain levels you unlock new floors.You have to make your way through these floors each a labyrinth packed with monsters puzzles and keys with of course corresponding doors. Within these floors theres a lot of different things fishing spots rocks farming patches all kinds of crazy stuff. Theres a ton of opportunity to use your skills to help progress through the floor more quickly or more safely.There comes a point where youll find the floors boss you defeat this boss and move on to the next floor.Its a real complicated skill not like woodcutting where its mostly just Well you can chop stuff and make canoes or whatever. Its really cool.So as for why its not in DS? Well dungeoneering is sort of instanced and all this junk that makes the PVP aspect of Darkscape kind of wonky with it. Its hard to make PVP work in that and if they dont make PVP work well in DG and be a major threat then its a huge grounds for training all sorts of skills completed detached from the risk of Darkscape.That said its not out of the question for it to return in the future its just a big design challenge is all.,RSDarkscape,cvaqvk2,2,t5_39we1

I guess by doing this the guards wouldnt come straight for him because by the time he reaches one side and two hits someone the guard is clear on the other side.

5216274,0,t3_3mf78m,So firstly let me say that I have played Eve online for almost a decade and have been part of some of the larger factions of Eve online and some of the smallest. In Eve you can have all of your items separated because traveling is easy. The risk involved in taking an empty clone and a shuttlerookie shippod is essentially nothing. No one is going to suicide gank you.That brings us to the next point what he is referring to with CONCORD is that if a person decides to illegally engage a target Meaning that they are not at war with the target or the targets sec status isnt low enoughisnt suspect it is an illegal crime that causes NPCs to spawn and kill you.This takes away from the charm of DarkScape I think because it stops players from dominating resources in the lowmed risk areas. Sure a player can lure a guard over there but to me THAT is more in the spirit of DarkScape than just having them spawn there...Resources in Eve are vast and unfathomable. For those of you who DONT play Eve let me put this into perspective. There is in general only one server that you play on Meaning you cant hop if the area is crowded however the amount of resources in the game would require MILLIONS of players to clear every day. The universe is fucking enormous. Eve also has combat anomalies DED sites DataRelic sites gas sites ore sites Wormholes rated mission classes ratting and incursions. DarkScape doesnt really have even a fraction of the options that Eve does.Dont get me wrong. I LOVE Eve it is a great game. But implementing what youre talking about would require a very large change to how resources are distributed and how big the world needs to be. Bearing in mind that we dont have warp drives jump clones jump bridges Titans Black OPs and the like in DarkScape. Also what is your ingame name? ,RSDarkscape,cver4xm,3,t5_39we1

Maybe thats the reason Darkscape is like this the godwars have went full swing into action again? After all Guthix is the only reason all of that was stopped and now hes gone. Im not too sure if factions would be a good thing here though. There are a fuck load of gods and territories arent divided in the game for something like that to go too well.

5431389,0,t3_3pfnrf,Mm. I heard about something similar regarding prayers yesterday cant find the post though.Anyway herblore. Im really disappointed and hope that in the future Ill get more than a lt edge over other players for such a massive investment of time and money. prayer mostly gives soulsplit now which I admit is still awesome and  herblore mostly gives the fact that you can use higher level spells and use saradomin brews more effectivelyget more effective potions as overloads consistently refresh . . . Its really disappointing. I guess it falls in line with them wanting things to have very diminishing returns after  but . . . Bleh.They probably just want to make sure s dont completely shitstomp people purely because they have OVLssturmoil sure but it feels so shitty. And I mean turmoils a oneoff investment that doesnt add risk. Overloads largely because youll stock up the overloads then probably never need to ever again a one time investment that adds minimal risk . . . I dont know though. It feels lame especially because it affects PVM.It does let people get into the PVP scene more quickly though thats purely what theyre going for and I can understand why things are the way they are. I just dislike it because Im the one getting the shaft I guess. Then again its not exactly a virtue to make a skill near useless.TLDR of how I feel  ARGG SOMETHING IS HAVING A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MY INVESTMENT BUT IT MAKES TOO MUCH SENSE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT AS MUCH AS I MIGHT WANT TO AND I CANT THINK OF A SIMPLE AND GOOD SOLUTION THAT ADEQUATELY FIXES THE PROBLEM WITHOUT CREATING NEW ISSUES.Also I think your post may have made someone panic sell torstol seeds. They had been buying slowly through the day then bam my K offer finished up got about  torstol seeds instantly. I think okay wow someones dumping so I buy another one to check the price theyre actually at the GE defaulted to my offer price as my offer was the standing offer but now theyll default to their standing offer theyre . Works for me. I buy up more and more seeds all at .

5432595,0,t1_cw5szy5,As a pker for hobby and having often watched Darkscape twitch streams I found several aspects hampering proper PvP Great differences in how much you risk vs. opponents make the experience frustrating. Possible solution? You must carry about the same or more risked wealth vs. your unskulled target notification when trying to initiate a fight. Take protect item into account. This would solve most of the ragginggriefing but may seem clunky? Piling on skulled players is not fun it should be a wilderness specific danger. Tagging is ok. This has been suggested by other redditors in the past. Smuggling is a potentially exciting feature but needs rework. Perhaps also limit teleportation by runes to a certain distance so you could mix in midhigh zones in specific spots inside or near low threat area.

5553668,0,t1_cwl4tkn,gt Where are you getting the idea that PVM weaknesses will even be removed?The combat triangle weaknesses will be removed. The TLDRs have specifically stated this multiple times.gt And if they will be if all will be set as equal why is there any necessity to make the EXPhour standardized? If things all do truly become equal there should be no worry at all about giving some classes higher or lower? EXPhour because it should all balance out no?No. Each combat style  burst cc whatever  will be stronger or faster against different enemies. It has nothing to do with weaknesses it has to do with speed of defeat.gt Of course they want players to attack other players as one tries to kill a monster.I agree. I think thats a great mechanic.But I think that the dead player should atleast walk away with SOMETHING. In the current system they get nothing at all because their minute fight only gives them exp per kill instead of per damaging hit.What part of this is so hard to understand?gt You said that you are balancing out the EXPhour of all monsters for all combat styles thats the gist of the idea no?The gist of the idea is to allow every player to gain exp at a similar pace in similar situations so that they can use the playstyle they want. The new combat system takes away the Legacystyle combat triangle and gives each weaponskillset its own pacing in combat which is different per each enemy.gt Weve already went over the fact that theres no evidence towards PVM weaknesses being removedIf the combat triangle is removed so will PvM weaknesses. And the combat triangle is  guaranteed to be removed.gt so the EXPhour update is your suggestion then not a natural progression of the combat update.The combat potential thing is already implemented in the game. It will remain implemented in the game in the new combat system. The game already registers it in order to dictate how much damage you do how much damage is done against you etc.What you dont seem to understand is that the combat potential algorithm already exists. My idea would just create a new algorithm on top of that one which would assign exp based on that algorithm  damage done in respect to that algorithm.The basic mechanics for the idea already exist. It wouldnt take long at all.gt Why do we need to somehow come up with a convoluted formula that allows players to receive . . . More? Less? Based on how weak they are relative to their enemy?If the system already dictates that you are going to deal less damage to your opponent than others with a different style youre already going to be dealing...well less damage. Lets say that this damage is .Another player with a different style would deal . The enemy has  hp.If we used the old exp per damage system like in RS the exp per any damage would be the same for everyone. So dealing  total damage would give exactly the same exp regardless of the speed of the kill. This means that the second player would get more exphour as theyd kill faster.In my system you get exp from the damage youve dealt in respect to your combat potential something the game already has. If  is your normal hit then youd get the same exp on that hit as the player whose normal hit is . The second player kills faster but the average rate is the same.When you have critical hits or hits below or above your normal hit the exp per that hit changes because the damage changes. So players that use a style that is more likely to have high damage AND deal critical hits against a certain enemy will still get more exphour on that enemy than other players but the BASE AVERAGE exphour will be the same for every style.This doesnt reward those that use the wrong styles or punish the ones that use the right styles like you think. Instead it brings up all styles closer to the max exphour gain in the new combat system with the new combat roles it would take literally  fucking forevers to gain any exp because the exp per kill per enemy is the same for everyone and you need to kill the enemy to get ANY exp.gt You should be getting the best EXPhour while using your absolute best gear.And you would be. Youd approach the max exphour for that enemy with the best equips. Its the average exphour that would be brought up for all styles. This new exp system does NOT invalidate what you think it does.The Power mechanic and other parts of the new combat system go against tierscape without punishing players for using better gear. My idea is the same way. Blalamander users would no longer gain more exp due to using broken weapons etc etc.,RSDarkscape,cwlhegw,1,t5_39we1

In addition combat in all Runescape games Rs osrs Darkscape is broken and not properly engaging.CombatI dont think Pvp will ever be successful within in Darkscape. Primarily due to lack of abilities since Eoc is in Darkscape and Eoc is not abilities. Even with Pis changes all this will do will change what choices you have but it wont add to the gameplay.If Darkscape is a game that will ever permanently pull me in it will have to do one of three things. Make combat engaging and worthwhileenjoyable.

I have had the quest cape i run around with warpriestgwd with the t weapon of my choice i can get better but honestly the main game has turned into grind skill for levels Grind boss for money buy spins for bxp wash rinse repeat.Darkscape brings us back to  Item Death which should have never been replaced with gravestones Death is a better item sink than any other feature so far.Darkscape gives everyone an even playing field we all started over and while I love EOC the resulting divide in the community made playing with others quite toxic as Legacy and EOC players often argue about which is better or what is unfair now we all use the same system for better or worse.Darkscape allows me to kill bots.Darkscape has made many creatures agressive speeding up training and giving the game a more tense atmospherethough the gnome guards...?Darkscape Has less worlds forcing competition and interaction between players no longer is this a solo experience.The new FP crowd getting to see members content and enjoy it has led to some fun experiences guiding them.Not having Buy more Keys pop up every  minutes.I can tell what equipment people are using by looking no longer does everyone have wings.starting over means the weapons I want wont cost tens of millions of coins and as such there is again a feeling of progression.nobody is showing off their seismicsnox.The Devs are amazing you guys talk to us take input yet stick to your guns when its necessary for a healty game. A good Dev is one who isnt afraid to piss off the vocal minority in order to make a better game but is also willing to admit when their idea isnt panning out. tax staying to combat inflation vs smuggling which was good on paper but didnt pan outOverall great job guys my only request at this point is some sort of statement as to what happens to our characters if Darkscape is deemed a failure?

Only guards that exist between them are Yanyille. The big desert under alkharid no guards at all. gt Cows and Goblins are the only thing you can train on while being protected by guardsremoving the guards does nothing for them the only place they may perhaps be helpful is letting you bank without being attacked.Thats all the new players need. A place to bank and get used to the game with the occasional wandering guard to give them some breathing room from PKers.gt That pure is just as likely to have his day ruined.It doesnt matter if the pure whos been playing for three months day is ruined by another pure they wont quit over that. What matters is the players who are being bullied by them who just joined. They need a chance to learn the game.gt Id argue that very few would get away with pking in banks with an initial surge of bank pking after guard removal people would quickly realize how pointless it is when the initial pkers are unable to bank either to get more food.Youre asking  people to be nice to eachother in a place where people frequently carry money for several seconds while everyone has an attack option on eachother.

Even v is incredibly hard to deal with. Assuming they arent braindead theyll use two different styles so youre taking  damage from one of them and you have to constantly be watching both of them to ensure you dont eat a gigantic spec too. If you play absolutely perfectly and manage to pray switch to avoid more than just one of their damage you still probably will die if theyre decent.Its just too easy to bully down solo PKers as a group.

6601588,0,t1_d01sl1u,Very few people seem to realize what stands behind greatly outnumbering. Its not like you get  on a dice and voila you are greatly outnumbering your enemies. Its a lot of hard work You need to recruit people. You need to spend a lot of time and effort talking to them and convincing them to trust you and join. You need to manage efficient communication and interaction in mass pvp and outside of it. You need to set some rules about armor and gear during the battles and actually enforce them. If people know they can come just with dds and get away with it soon they will stop giving a shit and you will start losing fights. You need to know when and where you should pick a fight. Sometimes your people are offline sometimes they are just not ready for a fight.This all turns into the art of winning the battle before it even started because you somehow greatly outnumber your enemies whos leaders and members didnt care to actually do all those steps.The term honorable is relative but you sure need to be good and smart to accomplish this and keep it going for some time.,RSDarkscape,d025pvi,1,t5_39we1

6693482,0,t3_477xfn,Right judging from my experience with some of these s let me fill this out a bit more.AgilityInstead Ape Atoll gives k per hour starting at level  While good its probably better to do the advanced gnome agility course once you reach level  or if you prefer to be unable to fail move to advanced gnome at level  and advanced barbarian at level .HunterAt level  onwords it is suggested to hunt Greenwalls using Crystallise. This is doubly problematic because the Hunter area is in an Elven cityTo this Id like to say that while the other methods do still work grenwalls are actually readily available in at least  places in the elven lands possibly more. Even discounting the fact that you forgot this or didnt know you can still complete the tiranwyn tasks needed to hunt grenwalls without papayas in Darkscape.ThievingThieving At level  the guide says to start pickpocketing dwarf traders using crystal mask and light form. Because of the high rate of failure without these spellsI wouldnt say that what you have is wrong pyramid plunder is most likely faster than dwarven traders. If you want to turn a profit however it is still fairly easy to do so simply lure the guards into the offices surrounding the trading floor and close the doors behind you. If you feel your pickpocket rate is too low skill up to do ardougne tasks  or perhaps pick up some gloves of silence.Woodcutting Crystal trees assuming the active tree is not in Prifddinas.  Now I corrected this on the wiki a couple months ago but I can understand if you didnt see it. Theres actually only  possible active crystal trees in Darkscape.

6747275,0,t3_484i2b,I feel that drama posts should possibly be removed if it gets serious. I have an example I posted something a few days ago about spawn killing. When requiem camps spawns I had a screenshot with accurate information it was a joke not a salt post or anything. Someone in the comments flamed and requiem and started a huge shit show. Then one of moderators commented that they would be removing MY post although my post didnt even provoke that salt war. The mods here should be more lenient when deleting posts but they should remove the serious dramafight provoking posts. Last night someone was accused of kicking a member of their clan because he was black although the person had proof there was also a lot of speculation surrounding the incident that was an example of a post that should be removed because the comments section turned to a pretty racist flame war,RSDarkscape,d0h83pm,5,t5_39we1

6749111,0,t3_4832e5,Both this thread and the other one have been approved. I dont personally have a problem with these types of posts as long as they have content rather than just being a flaming text post. If you have any issues with the current moderation either post a civil criticism ie just dont break rule   you can be as critical as you want just actually state your perspective and what needs to be improved or send a mod mail by clicking message the moderators. Were appreciative of everyones opinions and well reply. We want this subreddit to be open and fair for everyone. Were currently strict on flamingtrolling but thats something thats in discussion see the stickied thread and wed love to hear input from everyone.    As it stands banter and heated discussions are fine. If it crosses the line into flaming generally defined as pejorative use and insults with no substance then its grounds to be removed. If you feel a post of yours was wrongly removed then you can appeal it through mod mail. We have five moderators and take appeals seriously.,RSDarkscape,d0hexvp,3,t5_39we1
