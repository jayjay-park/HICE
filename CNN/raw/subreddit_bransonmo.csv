7678061,0,t3_4kgsdq,Best BBQ is Dannas You get whats called a Memphis roll with your meal  its a deep fried roll with a butter pat friggin amazing I always get . Place is lowrent but the BBQ is excellent. Get a meal and drive  miles over to the spillway by the damn and eat by the lake  Awesome deli sandwiches and sides at VaskensBest breakfasts are at Billy Gails Kooky little place literally filled with old people. My daughter says this kinda new place is good...I like La IguanaThis is a new one but has excellent reviews Hungry Hunter The food is very th century middle America!Local favorite for  years for pizza if you dont mind a short drive.  None of these places are expensive. For a watering hole I would recommend the Cheeky Monkey Heads up though  Its just outside city limits and as such they  are permitted to smoke in the building. Theres a lot of porch though. Food is decent. Best nonsmoking bar w also decent food is the Outback Pub Fish and chips rueben etc...Be forewarned Branson is famous for mediocre food.AVOID Fall Creek Steakhouse. Docs Roadhouse Charlies Steak and Ribs and the execrable Hong Kong Buffet. ,bransonmo,d3ey7ny,4,t5_2vl66
