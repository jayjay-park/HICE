Hes been visiting my mom for six years and now we live here with her.  Her dogs dont really like him looming over them but he doesnt even notice them.  They even nip at him sometimes and he doesnt flinch.  Hes amazing with children and all sized dogs.  Extremely gentle.  I think its a breed thing.  But the little dogs are never too thrilled about him.  As for cats my opinion is that theyre in their own.,greatdanes,ci3zay4,1,t5_2ssqy

2184233,0,t3_2k28af,I havent heard of the calcium supplements but that sounds like a good idea. Avoid puppy food at all cost.If you have tile or hardwood floors put a rug on it so the dog wont slide around.Do several walks a day for only  minutes. For the six months at least.Avoid stairs as they can loose footing easily when they run down stairs walking is fine and hurt themselves. Socialize very well you cant have a dog that big be aggressive. If you do this for the first year you should be fine ,greatdanes,clhgwa7,2,t5_2ssqy
2248237,0,t3_2ku8nl,shower them in toys. spending  in toys is cheaper than replacing or repairing things. really. it is. bell train them. you buy a cheap bell from a craft store. hang it on string at nose level. bop their nose into it every time you take them out which is about every  minutes in the beginning. you may end up with some sort of ptsd from all the ringing but its a carpet saver.teach manners above all else. no one likes an ill behaved dog and its magnified by a billion when the dog is huge. its not fun to have a bad behaved dog either. some smaller dogs can get intimidated by the sheer size of a dane and lash out. yours has to be rock solid and not react because even if your dog gets bit first guess whos going to get painted as the bad one?,greatdanes,clplqt0,1,t5_2ssqy

3161413,0,t3_2wcmaq,Hi congrats on getting a Dane!  Were  months into the puppy process ourselves with our first Great Dane so I can tell you what Ive learned so far from both research and trial and error.  Hope you find some of it useful!DietWe give Stark kibble called Taste of the Wild  After trying many different brands this one has led him to be the most regular when digesting.  If you do introduce new food you need to make it gradual.  It should take  days to get them going on a new food.  Days   new  old days   days   then day  is  new food.  As far as treats go we mostly use milk bone since Stark has a rather sensitive stomach.ExerciseIn the winter we dont take him walking very often but we have a laser pointer in the house which he loves to chase.  When he was smaller a quick  minute walk would do it and hed pass out when we got home.  Then as he got older it was  minutes   and so on.  My longest walks dont last more than an hour and a half.BloatUp until  months Stark was getting fed x per day.  AM  PM  PM.  After eating he would go in his crate for an hour.  Very important that they do not exercise for at least an hour after eating.   months  he eats at AM and PM.  We dont crate him after anymore since hes gotten into the habit of resting after eating.AccessoriesWhen hes small a leash works well with a plain collar.  If they start pulling you can get a harness.  The only reason I dont recommend one right away is just to save you money since theyll outgrow it so fast.  We have a harness for Stark now hes over  lbs and is super friendly so he always pulls when people are nearby.  working on that  But the harness is a great tool since it spins him back towards us when he starts to pull.  There is a metal ring that holds multiple ends of the harness and that is positioned on the chest.  There is where you clip the leash so if he pulls it will turn their chest to face you.  A handy trick we learned when we were teaching him not to jump on people was lowering the leash so I could step on it then only give him enough slack to stand comfortably.  When people walk up to him to say hi it keeps him firmly on the ground.  Eventually he gave up jumping on others.Only other thing I can think of are to get a very durable leash in the beginning.  That doesnt mean skimp later but puppies will chew and destroy almost any mesh leash.  We switched to a steel cable leash during his chewing phase and that held up wonderfully.  Now we use a leather leash and its very comfortable to walk him with.Actually one last thing.  Some may or may not agree with it but I find it useful with my dog.  Ive developed a look that I give him when he does something wrong.  I only do it within a second or two after hes done something bad and he instantly knows Im not happy.  My eyes become wide and very focused on his eyes with slightly bent eyebrows.  When I do that his tail goes between his legs and he becomes very submissive doing anything he can to make me happy again.  Dogs respond very well to body language so if your body and appearance shows your mad your dog will get the idea.  Theres so much literature out there now about positive training which is great but sometimes a dog needs to know that they must respect their owner and I find the look is how Ive accomplished that.  He doesnt fear me he respects me.  If he feared me he wouldnt sleep in my arms on our recliner like he does. I wish you all the luck in your new Great Dane experience!!,greatdanes,copog4d,1,t5_2ssqy

4085576,0,t1_crlwdsr,I didnt get much out of my spiked collar but we got much better results with real training. He was also a year old thenI did get results with using a water spray bottle when he mouths. ,greatdanes,crlzbt1,1,t5_2ssqy
4085989,0,t3_37dpnv,When we first got our boy Zephyr he was very much a puller ova leash as well since as you know they get big fast we wanted to correct the behavior ASAP. At first we did the pinch collar and that helped for a while but eventually we needed up getting a shockvibrating collar and that changed his behavior  degrees. As for the Dane Rage thats what we started calling it when they just start running and going crazy we started taking him in long hikeswalks or took him to the local dog park to play with other dogs. The other thing that really helped with our pup was walking him more often like once in the morning and once at night for a decent amount of time for him to get energy out. However it never stopped the Dane Rage completely. Honestly our guy is  years old now and still gets the Rage ever once in a while. The biting we would always grab a toy and put that in his mouth so he would know toys are for chewing and not our hands. When Zephyr was little he chewed on our hands all the time especially when he would play so thats what we did. It solved the problem. A spray bottle is a good idea too. Honestly my boyfriend dominates our guy like once or twice a week to the point when the dog starts shaking and that way our dog knows he is the boss. All I can recommend is definitely getting everything fixed sooner rather than later because once he is big its only going to be more of an issue. Last resort you could look into puppy classes or something. Good luck! Hope this helps ,greatdanes,crm10r9,1,t5_2ssqy

4784372,0,t1_ctxishu,Potentially  but Im pretty sure its just down to genetics! I dont know very much about the specifics of how danes inherit their coat and eye colors but I imagine its a more recessive gene because of how infrequently its seen. Since its not the breed standard I imagine that its not actively bred for or is something that either shouldnt be actively bred for or is frowned upon kind of like trying to breed for white boxers or breeding two merles together.Again I dont know a ton about the specifics of it I just know that its a rather uncommon eye color for danes outside of harlquins who have them more often than others and that rare blue eyes are commonly used as a scam to charge more for dane puppies ,greatdanes,ctxlz66,1,t5_2ssqy

6265579,0,t3_418z3b,Like the average height of a female great dane when shes matured or something? this place says that the full grown height is  inches. Im not sure where they measure to. But maybe just subtract  inches for the anatomy and the way the head bows? Im not positive about any of this and am making it up as I go if that makes a difference. My girl is  months now and is outgrowing her bowl set on a home depot  gal bucket Im not sure what Ill do as she gets taller but I figured she wont die if its a little too low Think my next step is an old chair. with a hole in it for the food bowl. ,greatdanes,cz1trlc,1,t5_2ssqy

11016457,0,t3_5xb782,I lost my female great dane Dec.  to cancer in the exact location. At the time she was given  weeks. She lived another  months. Although the knot started substantially getting larger she was able to have a normal life for a majority of that period. I would definitely not give her tramadol. It had the same effect on my dane. Rimadyl was the way to go. Every once in a while my dane would have a rough day and I would break a tramadol in half. Just to err on the side of caution I do believe towards the end her bone actually fractured in that leg due to the growth of the cancer. I wish your dane the best.

If Im honest our breeder sold us on the breed more than anything. We fell in love with him online and paid for him up front right away without even meeting him. Hes the best decision we have ever made. Advice Train them when theyre little because theyre harder to control when they outweigh you.  Our year old and year old take him for walks and hes got pretty good leash manners because we worked on that when he was little. Careful of happy tails too! Ours hasnt broken his yet but Ive heard horror stories of a very excited Great Dane wagging their tail into a wall and breaking it blood flying everywhere because theyre still pretty happy to see you! I dont know if this is the norm but ours suffers from separation anxiety and needs his people. We end up taking him with or having to put him in his crate if we are going to be gone long because he loves to shred paper to soothe his anxious big head.,greatdanes,df93wsp,2,t5_2ssqy
