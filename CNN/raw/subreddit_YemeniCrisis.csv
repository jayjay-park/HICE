5164158,0,t3_3lqn0b,Genocide in YemenBy Stephen Lendman | Sept   Information Clearing House   Yemen is Obamas war  coldblooded genocidal slaughter and mass destruction planned long before conflict began in late March using Saudi Arabia UAE other Gulf states and Egypt to do his dirty work.Terror bombing residential neighborhoods hospitals schools and other nonmilitary related targets continues. USSaudi enforced blockade prevents enough food medical supplies fuel clean water and other essentials from reaching desperate people in need. Human Rights Watch said whats ongoing may amount to starvation of civilians as a weapon of warfare  genocide by deprivation.According to Save the Childrens Mark Kaye at the moment we only have enough fuel in the north and center of the country for the next six weeks. Hospitals still operating lack fuel to run to run generators for their work.UN UnderSecretaryGeneral for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Stephen OBrien calls the scale of human suffering in Yemen almost incomprehensible.Over  million Yemenis may perish from hunger thirst andor lack of medical treatment for serious injuries and diseases.Western media are dismissive  largely ignoring an increasing UScreated holocaust. Near silence substitutes for what demands daily headlines and condemnation of Obamas latest imperial project  to destroy Yemeni sovereignty and return UScontrolled puppet leadership to power no matter the cost in lives lost vast destruction and unspeakable human misery.Official casualty numbers way understate the human toll. True figures are multiples higher than reported. Victims suffer out of sight and mind  mostly noncombatant civilian men women and children in harms way.Death and injury tolls rise daily. People are dying from lack of enough food to eat thirst and medical treatment for serious health issues  likely many thousands already maybe millions before conflict ends.On September  UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng and Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect Jennifer Welsh expressed concern at the ever increasing impact on civilians of the ongoing conflict in Yemen and the virtual silence of the international community about the threat to populations.Unless there is a serious commitment of the parties to find a political solution to the conflict that will end the violence and ensure humanitarian access to all populations without discrimination the situation is likely to degenerate further they explained. Major crimes of war and against humanity are being committed daily. Civilians are indiscriminately being slaughtered.The UN Special Advisers reminded national authorities of their primary responsibility to protect the Yemeni population. The international community has a responsibility to protect populations from genocide war crimes ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.Ongoing mass slaughter and human suffering are largely ignored. The appalling toll on Yemeni civilians increases daily  exacerbated by Riyadhs use of banned chemical weapons and cluster bombs.UNICEF reports eight children killed or maimed daily. The true figure is likely multiples more as well acute malnutrition taking a devastating toll on millions Yemenis of all ages.Britain is complicit with Obamas war  selling Saudi Arabia deadly weapons like Washington. Days earlier Oxfam CEO Mark Goldring said Yemen descended into a humanitarian disaster putting its people at risk of famine and the UK is materially involved through its export of arms and military support to the bombing campaign.It is time the government stopped supporting this war and put every possible effort into bringing an end to the carnage its fueling  causing unbearable human suffering.The UK successfully lobbied hard over many years for a UN Arms Trade Treaty to regulate the arms trade which came into being last year. This government has incorporated the treaty into national law yet at the first test of the new law it has turned a blind eye to mounting evidence of potential misuse of its weapons and support.Jeremy Corbyn chairs Britains Stop the War Coalition. It issued a strongly worded statement last spring shortly after US orchestrated Saudiled terror bombing began sayingThe Stop the War Coalition condemns the British governments support for the Saudiled attack on Yemen. This war is a further destabilising act of aggression in the Middle East which risks embroiling the region and its peoples in a still wider war.Saudi Arabia is now playing a leading part in almost every antidemocratic development in the Middle East including joining in the current AngloAmerican bombardment in Iraq We repeat our longstanding demand that Britain end its alliance with the dictatorial and oppressive Saudi regime and cease supplying it with arms.This present conflict in Yemen reflects the determination of both Saudi Arabia and the western powers to destroy the democratic potential of the Arab Spring in one country after another. Only the people of Yemen can resolve the crisis in that country and decide their own future and their independence and territorial integrity must be fully respected.Bernie Sanders has not as yet called out Washingtons war machine  by failing to condemn the growing holocaust in Yemen. Instead he urges greater Saudi involvement in regional conflict theaters  which will lead to more slaughter destruction and human misery.All Republican and Democrat presidential aspirants support US hegemonic ambitions  color revolutions and genocidal wars the main ways to achieve it. ,YemeniCrisis,cv8h0om,1,t5_371eb

6953927,0,t3_4aynej,As this press release poorly explains alShabaab took over the port city of Garacad also spelled Garaad  Garad in Puntland earlier this week. Interestingly they invaded it through sea with fishing boats containing dozens of militants. Their boats apparently went through undetected by maritime security which gets foreign naval support to curb piracy. The mayor of Garacad said that the town was seized without resistance. Residents have fleed the town in droves. Somalia has also gone on alert for other potential attacks on ports.Puntland State of Somalia is an autonomous selfdeclared state in northern Somalia that has a small army of its own however it is not secessionist like the Republic of Somaliland. In spite of the Federal Government of Somalias wishes the President of Puntland has refused to depend on AMISOM forces calling them worthless so they are going after alShabaab on their own. Journalists have been denied access to regions where the fighting is ongoing so the narrative from Somali news sites is almost exclusively informed by Puntland security sources and officials. According to them alShabaab pulled out of the port but expanded into neighbouring villages in the Nugal province and put up fierce resistance to the Puntland militarys subsequent offensive. They also claimed to kill dozens of alShabaab militants. Despite reports from residents of relative calm being restored to Suuj village on Thursday heavy fighting near GodobJiran was said to continue today.AlShabaab also controls the port town of Haradhere where they are suspected to have invaded Garacad from by boat. According to Reuters alShabaab had imposed a curfew on Haradhere last Sunday. Residents reported an unusually active movement at the port during that nights curfew spurring rumours about alShabaab importing weapons or bringing in foreign fighters.As a group that has pledged baya to both Bin Laden and Zawahiri and as part of the alQaeda network alShabaab is linked with the Yemenbased alQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. AlShabaab and AQAP have exchanged fighters in the past and AQAP figures have expressed fantasies of the two groups mutually gaining control of the Bab elMandeb strait to prevent shipping to Israel. AlShabaabs bombing operations have also become more sophisticated as seen by some recent bombing attempts such as the bombing of a plane at Mogadishu Airport with a laptop bomb aimed at killing intelligence officals that went undetected by Xray devices in addition to a few foiled bombs planted in other electronics. This has lead analysts to speculate that alShabaab is recieving instruction from AQAPs master bombmaker Ibrahim alAsiri or one of his students. Yemens security effects Somalias and viceversa.,YemeniCrisis,d14k6bv,4,t5_371eb
7016929,0,t3_4bre0x,Of course one always knows better with hindsight. Nevertheless its actually rather surprising to read that people from WINEP  one of most influential thinktanks in the DC and then also one to which Riyadh listens too  needed one year to come to certain of conclusions listed in that article. ...not to talk about the fact that the Saudis didnt know better on their own after all they are there on the Arabian Peninsula and on the border of Yemen. They should have known Yemenis they should have known Hadi Houthis Saleh their military forces etc  and thus they should have known better  but they didnt. ,YemeniCrisis,d1bptmi,4,t5_371eb
7045850,0,t1_d1ewfid,Theres no doubt that for much of the last year the Saudiled coalition ignored the AQAP. Thanks to what Hadi was promising to them they expected to quickly roll back the Houthis and then defacto return to business as usual from earlier times. That didnt work because AQAP exploited the opportunity and quickly spread. Around SeptemberOctober when they realized what the Op Golden Arrow caused in this regards namely that this defacto created a power vacuum behind their and allied troops there were even some indirect negotiations that is some of local representatives travelled to KSA to ask what shall they do with the AQAP. But since February Saudis are activelly involved against the AQAP  and Mukhalla was the first bigger operation against Jihadists. It seems that Emiratis began running such ops already at earlier time but finding out about what are their helicoptersupported SFs doing around in southeastern Yemen is nearly impossible.EDIT regarding links... trying to follow this war with help of internet it hopeless. Saudis have bought most of the relevant media but remain dilletantic in regards of what they do report. Here one example Namely attack on Mukhalla was no liberation of the place but a raid on several depots inside the port and one ammo depot outside the town. Ever since much bigger antiAQAP ops have been launched in Aden area resulting in neardestruction of Jihadists there. Finding related links is very easy if for no other reason then because that UAEAF Mirage  crashed during a related air strike. ,YemeniCrisis,d1f070r,1,t5_371eb

Most densely populated areas however are under HouthiSaleh control.Who is winning? I dont think either of them are. HouthiSaleh has lost territory is on the defensive and stands no chance of governing all of Yemen so that extent they could be said to be losing. But the Saudiled coalition has failed at achieving their objectives. They made some grand goals at the beginning of the war expecting Hadi to walk in to Sanaa  security being restored and Houthis neutralized which no one sees happening now. I doubt any side has more than a plurality of support. like most civil wars. When I started following this war before the Saudi intervention there was very little support for the Houthis but it grew with the bombings. Most of the south supported the intervention and some in the contested areas of the north to a lesser extant others simply see it as aggression on Yemen. In Saudi Arabia there hasnt been any significant opposition to the war.Ceasefires Each ceasefire had fighting and airstrikes continue during it. It can be hard to tell who violated it first without ground sources in some cases local factions made no attempt to adhere to it.
