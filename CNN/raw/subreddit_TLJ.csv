6146335,0,t3_3iwjpu,I would say dreamfall chapters is good about explaining things that happened in dreamfall the longest journey but it does pick up after the events of dfthe longest journey so you might feel lost. However I originally played dreamfall longest journey without knowing the longest journey existed and I did okay. Its more for story purposes. ,TLJ,cyo9v4p,1,t5_2u3ik
