11172736,0,t1_deyew99,Thank you for your sympathy.No I have never been moved before which is adding to my apprehension!It is a little difficult to access but not super difficult. There are two sets of stairs up to my front door but they are relatively wide and shallow. My bedroom is on the second floor. Anyone moving me will have to negotiate a short flight of stairs onto a landing then turn  degrees and down another longer sets of stairs which I imagine will be the most difficult bit. I weigh about  stone so things could be worse on that front. My guess would be that the paramedics ? who move me will have had to deal with much larger people in more awkward situations. ,nhs,deyf18g,2,t5_2romi
