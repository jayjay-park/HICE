6853520,0,t3_49n37u,Dance breakdownNot my words. Wikis... In many dance records the breakdown often consists of a stripping away of the pitched elements most instruments  and often the percussion  while adding an unpitched noise sound effect. This is often treated with a lot of reverb and rises in tone to create an exciting climax. This noise then cuts to a beat of silence before returning to the musical part of the record.,connectasong,d0t5kys,1,t5_39xl7
