9292854,0,t3_57gzmd,It is rare for me to have a day without chocolate or peanut butter often as a sweet. So unless my chocolate or peanut butter comes in protein bar form I definitely eat the sweets daily. Halloween has nothing to do with my chocolate obsession most Halloween candy is crap so I actually avoid that. edit  The tracker is working I am discouraged from the candy eating. Bought some chocolate and cookie protein bars today. Have eaten acorn squash with cinnamon butter edit  the track stopped working. Oh well. Nom nom nom chocolates  ,TeamNebula,d8txp2k,4,t5_3gvdw

9513635,0,t3_5b2z4i,Thought I missed it. Saw that it needed to be submitted by Thursday... but its next Thursday.  As a bonus I am down another  pounds this week.  Also I may be gaining a little weight. I started creatine so I may have some water weight built up. I weigh myself early in the morning postworkout prebreakfast so I shouldnt see much of the gain since I will probably pee a lot before I weigh in.,TeamNebula,d9lrb5e,3,t5_3gvdw
