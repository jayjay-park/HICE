578090,0,t1_cg5yuzq,gt Either way that sign does not carry the force of law. I think someone should point that out to the owner so that they may post a sign which complies with the law.This is an interesting point.  If Im understanding you correctly theres a type of signage  like the kind banks display  that actually makes it illegal to be in an establishment with a gun.  However wouldnt the business owner still be within his rights regardless of the sign out front to refuse a customer service who was carrying a gun?

The same problem would happen if it was still called Tigernet. The problem is with the DHCP server that has run without issue for years. However now everyone and their mother has a desktop laptop tablet smartphone and gaming console that all want IP addresses. The influx of devices has overwhelmed the DHCP server so randomly people arent able to obtain an IP address which means no connectivity whether they are on wireless or wired connections. ,Clemson,cgpeqv4,7,t5_2qlts

There were great enthusiastic professors like Malloy Hallstrom Goasguen Dean and Hodges but they get brought down by professors like Lowe Pargas Luo and Sterling. If it were possible it would be interesting to take a group of students and have them only take classes from the toptier professors and leave the other group to the bottomtier professors  and see where they stand after  years.Overall Im not convinced that a degree in CS from CU is the best investment you can make.

The student government had less money back in those days due to the university being significantly smaller and still were able to get those awesome concerts.
