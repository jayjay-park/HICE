5700499,0,t1_cx3o15r,Well look at shows like MASH one of the alltime great shows. not ww but relevant Absolutely hilarious comedy but it certainly doesnt turn a blind eye to the realities of war.  Hogans Heroes an obvious example of how to do humor in a grim WW theater.  These shows managed to humanize the enemies without turning a blind eye to their vicious crimes.  These shows were created with thought and compassion.,WorldWarToons,cx3pagd,1,t5_37twc
