590373,0,t3_1zzd97,Yeah  and its not just us.  I run with about  different people on any given day and they all experience it.  Some days are worse than others.  For example  before the patch I never had more than  deaths.  Now Im getting upwards of  in domination.  It also feels like lag switching and I have literally reported people for it everyone but this one kid left the super laggy game  the game stayed laggy until he left.  I have literally fallen off the map because of lag prison break  I was on the hill overlooking the prison.  Its been so bad that I have gone from upstairs on a map to downstairs and into a different room.  For the record  everyone on my ally list has over a . kdr  and they have all been going negative more deaths than kills when it gets really bad  usually around even  when its not.  ,CODNintendo,cg7dnxl,2,t5_307bd
