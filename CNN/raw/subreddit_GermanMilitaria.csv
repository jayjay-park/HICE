I also suggest checking out my favorite Third Reich militaria resource www.warrelics.euExcellent website with a lot of information to be had. They can also help you identify any fakes among the collection theyve helped me avoid several fake items in the past that were very good replicas. Also beware of appraisers who may try to swindle you out of items. I prefer the forum giving me their thoughts on my items as they stand nothing to gain from telling something is legit or isnt. ,GermanMilitaria,cewjm8o,2,t5_2wjfr

763729,0,t3_22vbe1,I have never seen anything like this before but taking a guess it looks to me like it is a kind of recognition guide for the German reich. As we all know just about everyone in civil service had a type of uniform at that time. That being said I can only imagine how difficult it could be for a. Civilian to recognize who belonged to what organization. The allies made similar books to use to help recognize friends and and enemies as well.,GermanMilitaria,cgr3beu,3,t5_2wjfr
10690457,0,t3_5ntic5,When I was younger I used to go to a lot of Estate sales and occasionally there would be some Militaria. Once I got really lucky and found a knife very similar to that one but it had a chain and a bit more detailing. I think I paid less then  dollars for it but I had no idea what it was worth so I ended up selling it for a bit less. Now that I know a bit more about this kind of stuff I have realized what a mistake that was...,GermanMilitaria,ddin44s,2,t5_2wjfr
