Frat Tanas Suspect Kenan Muhammet Uzuneras Doctor Cemal Use the thumbs up and thumbs down icons to agree or disagree that the title is similar to Once Upon a Time in Anatolia. None of their stories are particularly resolved but they don t need to be.In tone its Ceylans most epic and talky film yet. But dont be fooled  its also his most mysterious and meditative.We meet a group of a dozen policemen soldiers and others as they drive about on the steppes one night in search of a body with the two men suspected of burying it. Its an ensemble piece and for much of its minute running time the film itself feels like a painful fruitless inquiry as it seeks themes subjects and characters to latch on to. Its a police procedural yes but you imagine thats just an excuse to bring together a varied group of men in the face of a terrible event. Its very far indeed from a traditional whodunnit.The prosecutor is familiar with the drug as his fatherinlaw took it for his heart problems. There was one thunderclap early in the film that was so intense and believable that it made me jolt in my seat. Kenan one of the suspects leads them from one water fountain to another at the time of the crime he was drunk and he cannot recall where he and his mentally challenged brother buried the body. Look out for The Turin Horse which is coming out on Bluray next month.Written by commanderblue.
