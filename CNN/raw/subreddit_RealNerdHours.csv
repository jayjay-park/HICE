11105158,0,t1_deqr8ij,Its even worse when it used to be free. You took something I used to be able to do for free and put a price tag on it just because the obscene amount of money Im paying for their cheaplymade toy and the games for it and  to get a controller that isnt a piece of shit because normal controller is now an extra and the DLC they inevitably crap out and now I gotta pay just to get the full features of that game too?
