You could go for the fissure base if youd rather save your sand dollars for SoS but tidal has a slight edge over fissure in power and attraction and is more generally useful than saving up for an eventual hydro upgrade so I would recommend getting tidal.,mousehunt,cv79l9i,1,t5_2rcti

If you collect rockforth cheese you can go after the Rockstar and Moussile as uayushah says. And some people like to get the three stars on the map meaning they caught every mouse in that area.The mice themselves usually drop more loot but its not that exciting.

9332259,0,t1_d8yx8fi,In the case of sniping you make a match over in such a group. Either you offer to snipe or someone with a map is looking for a sniper. A price is agreed on and friend requests are made. A map invite is sent the map is joined the mouse is caught the sniper leaves the map and then the sniper is paid. Once in a while snipes fail for one reason or another in which case the sniper usually isnt paid.The chest rewards are definitely worth the effort  dont look at it as something you have to do alone. If you get  people hunting a map it goes much faster. If they communicate so you arent all going after the same boss mouse it goes even faster.,mousehunt,d8yxk5r,1,t5_2rcti
