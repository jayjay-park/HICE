8851545,0,t1_d7bnese,There were a couple of things wrong with your file.The javax.vecmath.Vectorf module wasnt imported.There were indentation issues causing things not to work as they should.You were also tracking the camera with the first Sacky. The Track components constructor requires first the object then the target in that order Track track  new Trackthis scene.camera The component then should be added to the components of the camera scene.camera.components.addtrackTo avoid any confusion maybe it would be better to add the component inside a class for the camera. Remember that theres a Camera class already in bdx so the class should have a different name for example Cam.java. You can either change the name of the camera to Cam or use a custom class for the camera Cam.java you can find it in the Object panel.Ive also seen you doing this this.components.addtrack. Theres no reason to reference components through the class if the class with all of its fields and modules is already imported. You can just do this components.addtrack.As for your goal you can just use the allinone Follow.java in the tutorial.temporary linkHowever to create a simple AI you probably need to create a variant of the Follow component where the AI wouldnt float and would only bank and not tilt nor pitch so only rotate on the Z axis. That will be step two. Ill post an example of that later.,bdx,d7btwit,1,t5_357s3
