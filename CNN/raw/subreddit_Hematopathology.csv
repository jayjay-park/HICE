7781890,0,t1_d3qpr27,Thanks for your input! Ideally I would like to stay in Canada so fingers crossed I can find something here. Of course it will be another  years or so before I start applying for residencies so anything could happen between now and then but its nice to know that Im not setting myself up for failure from the get go. Unfortunately Im on the very opposite side of the country New Brunswick from Vancouver but I do love the west coast and Vancouver is a beautiful city. Ill look into that. Thanks for the tip!,Hematopathology,d3qqii2,1,t5_2wh6r
