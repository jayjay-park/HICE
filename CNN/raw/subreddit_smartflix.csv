6357360,0,t1_czbumu3,Time will tell I suppose. For people like me only  of all Netflix content is available in my country. The bottom line is that Im only willing to pay for a Netflix account if Im able to access all the other content whether through Netflix itself or through something like Smartflix.If Netflix wants to restrict my access or ban my account for me not being happy with only being able to access  of their old mediocre programmes then thats perfectly fine with me... that  is just not worth it anyway.usmartflix  Consider this comment as fanmail woo! ,smartflix,czc9fok,1,t5_3ahh7
6586063,0,t1_d00jvxc,gt I doubt people would be up in arms if you guys had come out and explained what happened instead of just changing the website.We have no way to be up front about it though. The number of subscribers on this subreddit isnt even a fraction of the people who use the application! ,smartflix,d00jwnj,1,t5_3ahh7

6645038,0,t1_d06n31x,Im trying to sell the idea of Smartflix to a friend by showing them the content of one specific country only.Do you know if Smartflix supports all the countries out there that do have Netflix and if not is there a list of the countries that are on Smartflix?,smartflix,d06nkrp,1,t5_3ahh7

6658973,0,t3_46v0qo,Same thing happened to me.. AVG flagged updater.exe as being infected with IDP.ARES.Generic..Cant reinstall as AVG is blocking it.. Have already sent a mail to smartflix for a feedback about this.EDIT You should check this link The issue seems to be coming from the new version of Squirrel updater..,smartflix,d083fno,2,t5_3ahh7
6679836,0,t1_d0a4y2w,Well what Im saying is that theres no way to choose the audio language for something available in multiple regions even when we know its available. Between bilingual people and language learnerstheres ample reason to be able to swap your preferred language. I feel like your answer is in regards to a different issue of people assuming all movies are available in English or something  Im just talking about accessing content that is already confirmed available. ,smartflix,d0a95dc,0,t5_3ahh7

6768712,0,t1_d0a9cjm,Yeah please do not make it dependent on PC language. I speak Spanish my first language but my laptop has everything in English. I watch everything in English too so no problem there. But when I want to watch something with my parents or my little brother I want to select Spanish subtitles without changing the whole language to my laptop.,smartflix,d0jiih1,1,t5_3ahh7

7356689,0,t3_4g2sow,Its a limitation on Netflixs end. p is only available in IE. Smartflix is based on Chromium which can only do p.When Netflix allows nonIE browsers p viewing Im sure youll see it in Smartflix as well.,smartflix,d2eelju,8,t5_3ahh7
7724387,0,t3_4l3twz,gtAll lists should load a little bit faster now MY LISTS search results genres etc.Thank God for that. The slowness of watch later lists has been bothering me for months now. So much so that I have pictures of my watch later list so that I can go through them faster. Thanks for this. Good job.,smartflix,d3k7jkj,4,t5_3ahh7
7806735,0,t1_d3tf7b1,giving updates in a situation like this is counterintuitive as I would bet donuts to dollars there are netflix agents that check this sub to see if theyre squirming at SF.,smartflix,d3tjfa6,10,t5_3ahh7
7851002,0,t1_d3ydae8,Thats because it was in a sense. The only thing it did was violate Netflixs Terms of Use which most countries do not have a law saying this is illegal  this is what caused Netflix to clampdown. If it was illegal any VPN provider wouldve received a cease and desist and sued the shit out of ages ago. ,smartflix,d3yitnp,6,t5_3ahh7

7872090,0,t1_d40vwxg,gt  This is the only topic you post about.Its Smartflix that made me discover Reddit.gt Do you work for netflix or something ?I dont work for Netflix or anyone else. Redditors are supposed to be slightly more educated than the average. Im baffled to see how many people in this subreddit fail to understand the obvious. Theyre surprised that Smartflix got shut down. Theyre convinced that because they paid a Netflix subscription they didnt steal anything. I took the time to write a clear explanation and I hope that itll help them to understand.gt You say youre not judging anyone for pirating and since smartflix is pirating why even make this post ?Im not fighting piracy. Im fighting this stupid misunderstanding.  The concept of Smartflix has put too much confusion into the heads of many. It drives me mad probably Im OCD. Ill be more than happy to resume my normal life when this subject is settled.,smartflix,d40w8lx,-6,t5_3ahh7
7875236,0,t1_d411kdk,Postal services work all around Europe. You can buy train tickets plane tickets make hotel reservations from all over Europe. There are a lot of services that indeed work across countries. Actually it is one of the most basic directives that goods and services must be freely deliverable  and accessible across Europe.Actually it is the publishers who bribe EU officials not to enforce these laws more strictly. The EU economic union is more like in the US. Denying service in Poland while enabling in Germany is like making a service unavailable in Florida that is available in California. This is ridiculous and YOU know that is it is ridiculous.So you can stop protecting the nonsense from multi million dollar companies and criminalizing normal people.,smartflix,d418z6l,1,t5_3ahh7
7888859,0,t3_4nbufc,Youre not the only one I just cancelled my Netflix subscription just in time new period starts tomorrow and also started to use Kodi.Please dont stop working on Smartflix when it works again ill continue my Netflix membership Ill even donate you guys if itll help the progress.Netflix just isnt the same without Smartflix. Ofcourse i want to watch the Movies and Television shows in a legit way but with this region blocking it is just not possible. Almost nothing of the shows i watch are on the Dutch Netflix maybe  percent but not more..Please dont stop working on Smartflix Ill happily subscribe to this service again!,smartflix,d42s47u,8,t5_3ahh7
