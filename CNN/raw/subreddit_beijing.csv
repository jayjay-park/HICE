I dont think the reputation or quality of the school really matters here as most schools that are eligible for hosting international exchange programs are okay schools and I dont think theres a significant difference unless you went to   or  and even so the difference is negligible. Its more about going out and see a different world and experiencing ppl and culture that is totally different so you wont taking wtf picture of unrefrigerated eggs or butcher shops later in your life. ,beijing,ci554iu,2,t5_2s0m4

1614715,0,t1_cjip0jh,this is another thing you should understand about china never get involved in someone elses fight. There are plenty of stories of foreigners trying to break up fights and both groups end up turning on the foreigner and beating the shit out of him. There was even a story posted here on reddit a few years ago of a guy visiting shenzhen who saw a guy slapping what appeared to be his gf. The foreigner got involved and was rewarded with a beer bottle to the head and a trip to the hospital. If you see shit happening just call the cops and dont put yourself in the middle of any dangerous situation because no chinese person is going to help you out. Chinese guys dont go out drinking in groups smaller than  or  no chinese guy goes to the bar alone even when going out with the gf they bring all their friends along and if you start a fight with one you started a fight with all of them,beijing,cjip9n3,2,t5_2s0m4

2544633,0,t3_2ouvv6,Hi! I just graduated from college in the states and now I go to Tsinghua right now for Chinese Language hoping to do their Masters for Public Policy in the fall. The school is legitimate. When I say that I mean their president attended Tsinghua their former president did as well. When you say you go to Tsinghua people think youre a genius. Its more competitive for people in China applying but its also pretty difficult for foreigners but the English programs are slightly easier I would think. I would equate Tsinghua to being the MIT of China and Peking University to Harvard. Their education is very cheap here compared to the states. The school is also massive and has a very large international presence. I think its ranked  internationally always top  or  in China next to Peking hope that kinda helps!  ,beijing,cmqpxtb,6,t5_2s0m4
