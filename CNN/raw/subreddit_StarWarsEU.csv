He loved the Republic Commando game so when I told him there were book based on them he had to check them out. From there I had him go through the Wraith parts of XWing the Mara Jade parter Allegiance and Choices of One all of Legacy and Fate.

The Jedi Knight quest especially has me throwing all my free time at it.Still not a fan of how they handled the transition between KotOR and SWTOR I feel like no one at BioWare even bothered to play KotOR .

I stole its destinybecause I helped it.    Jacen That wasnt helping. Thats not what help means either.    Vergere No? I saw a creature in agony crying out in terror and I undertook to ease its pain and assuage its fear. But tell me this Jacen Solo what should I have done that you would call help?    Jacen I suppose the best help you could offer would be to keep the cocoon safeand leave it alone to fight its own battle.    Vergere And perhaps also to protect it from other wellintentioned folkwho might wish in their ignorance to help it with their own utility cutters.

1346577,0,t1_cil3dsx,Oh man I thought the Jedi Knight story was pretty fun!  I view video game stories a bit different than novels as I would not have called the Knight story great if I had been reading it from a book.  I have got fairly far into the Smuggler story which has been pretty fun the others Im barely into.  I have heard good things about the Operative story line and am excited to delve into that one a little.I am not saying the game is amazing by any means if it wasnt a Star Wars game I would  not have ever played it to begin with.  The tedious tasks thing can be applied to pretty much every game out there though.  Its just how cleverly the developers can disguise the tasks or change them up with scenery or characters involved.  I havent really played it consistently because I feel that youre not wrong about the tedious tasks.  I dont think they have done a bad job disguising them relative to some other games out there though.  The big thing for me just exploring the Star Wars universe and getting the stories in.  I also enjoy doing flashpoints and working with a team to beat those.  I just wish people werent so anxious to cruise through them so I could see the cutscenes.  I feel like too much of a douche to not spacebar through them when everyone else is.The PVP isnt really my scene which I feel is probably something you would need to be into to really make SWTOR a great game.  My PC also struggles keeping up in PVP which really makes it a lot less fun for me.My one big wish for the game would be to have it a bit more open world similar to the way that SWG was.,StarWarsEU,cil3tj3,2,t5_2tg71

Sheev is suspiciously close to the name of the Indian god Shiva.  gt Shiva is responsible for change both in the form of death and destruction and in the positive sense of destroying the ego the false identification with the form.

Truce at Bakura blends the two together very tightly with entechment unlike most other Star Wars materials especially the movies... other than midichlorians.BUT... the Ssiruuk are a generally unique enemy in the realm of Star Wars and the EU.

4943008,0,t3_3im5bl,No one knows officially but Im in this rare part of the Fandom that actually enjoys the no relationship rule of the Jedi Order from a story and fictional character standpoint. I love the idea if a Jedi pushing away worldly desires because they have a higher duty because they have an obligation to defend all the people in the galaxy and know deep down if they have someone they value over other people they may not be able to put the galaxy ahead of that person. The idea that the galaxy needs the Jedi to not have attachments is also a cool idea. The idea that people may not trust the Jedi to save their skins if Jedi have families is interesting. Would they truly believe the Jedi would save them? What if the Jedi had to chose between the average citizen and his family? When they see a Jedi who lives by the code people will believe that Jedi will do all he can to save all the people not just those hes closest too. Of course I love this from a fictional stand point. I doubt the is would really work in our world. However these are magical space wizard who have powers that can be amplified by emotions. I could never put myself in their shoes and say its easy or hard to live that life but damn if I dont love the Paladin type of Jedi that puts the Order and the galaxy first. ,StarWarsEU,cuhlt8i,9,t5_2tg71

Whats the difference between one galaxy spanning republic and another that just happen to have been interrupted by a Sith interregnum?Actually it does jive its just that you assumed that the before was immediately before. If I say Halloween is before Christmas thats still correct even if someone were to incorrectly assume Halloween is RIGHT BEFORE Christmas. If I say all months have  days thats still correct even if someone were to incorrectly assume that ALL months have ONLY  days. Just because one makes a false assumption about a true statement that doesnt make the true statement false.And dont forget the line in Episode II about there not being a war since the formation of the Republic. Now lets use simple logic here. FACT The last time there was a war was before the Republic... Sio Bibble in Episode II FACT The Republic has only stood for  years Palpatine in Episode II FACT The Sith were thought extinct for  years KiAdi Mundi in Episode I...That means that the destruction of the Sith happened the same time the Republic was formed. So the question is... What existed before? Unless were to believe that before the formation of the Republic  years prior the galaxy was a lawless place with no government which is a ludicrous idea or that the Sith Empire had been the original rulers of the galaxy before the Republic even more ludicrous pure commonsense says there had to have been a galactic government that the Jedi protected against the Sith. Do you have any reason why this ancient government shouldnt be the Old Republic?gt You know the answer I always preferred? Its an uncharacteristic onceinalifetime slip of the tongue from Palpatine.

Is it just because it was a relatively short novel or because is was something of a coming of age story?  Honestly the YA tag almost caused me to pass this one up but Id already read pretty much everything else in the new Canon while waiting for TFA to drop.  I worry that a lot of fans will miss this great story because of the YA tag.One of my favorite bits was how they inserted the characters into small but pivotal roles in the major events of the Original Trilogy such as minor spoilerss Ciena being the one to disable the Hyperdrive on the Falcon in Cloud City or how her smart friend forget her name Jude is the one to successfully analyze the attack on the st Death Star and identify the threat it posed.  I also thought that the character progression we see in the friend from Alderaan forget his name too someone help be out here Nash was fascinating.Edit Added stuffEdit  Terrible with remembering names thanks utreefiddylq,StarWarsEU,cyorwdv,15,t5_2tg71

6200185,0,t3_40gdex,Im an EU fan not a big one but I still hold some of the books especially the Thrawn Trilogy in high regard. My main quarrel with TFA wasnt killing off the EU since this was inevitable if Star Wars was to continue. My main quarrel is we get to hear about stuff but we dont get to see it and we dont hear much either. The whole movie felt rushed and detached from anything else that dons the Star Wars trademark. Anakin sacrificed himself in ROTJso what? In this movie the Empire lives on even more brutal than before with a cheap Emperor knockoff leading it and still destroying worlds. Its as if the Original Trilogy was disregarded for some cheap Marvel lookalike I didnt want to see.Dont get me wrong I do love some of the stuff in the film especially Kylo Ren but by god! This movie is even worse than the prequels when it comes to some of the sins. Why do we have to hear about Like training Kylo why cant we see it? Why do we have to only hear about Kylo destroying Lukes academy why dont we get to see Han and Leia growing apart following what happened with their son?Thus movie has a serious lack of emotional punch. Instead of Luke looking at the binary sunset we get a homage to Apocalypse Now instead of Luke confronting the truth about Vader on Dagobah we get Rey falling into an absurd vision taken straight out of an Irvin Welsh movie adaptation instead of Han shooting his way out of a bad situation we get that thing from the Korean movie The Host instead of Boba Fett we get a bureaucrat in shiny armor instead of Jabbas thugs we get a blatantly racial and probably racist NeoTokyoGlasgow Neds street gangs... You get my point.This movie felt like a rushed job trying to play it safe not introducing anything new to the franchise. Except an overthetop Hitler caricature as the officer of overthetop Nazi organisation carricarure that is still more racially diverse than New York City.God that is a long rant but I felt extremely disappointed with this one. When Mad Max gets a much much better sequel than Star Wars you know something is wrong.Still Kylo Ren is a bad ass and the next installment is directed by the same person who did Ozymandias. I still keep my hopes highIve just lowered my expectations.,StarWarsEU,cyue7ur,6,t5_2tg71

6559560,0,t1_czx866k,Where is it stated that those were there chosen forms seriously I dont remember it ever being stated those were the forms they all followed and even if he did use those forms it does not mean he mastered them Both Obiwan and Anakin were proficient with JarKai and neither had been stated as masters of it Obi was also proficient with Ataru and and shiicho but is only stated as having mastered soresu. edit I can believe Talon favors Ataru as she is always throwing her body in the air. But Cade does this as well and he is by no means a master lightsaber duelistNo Morne didnt back stab Draco if you go back to that fight Draco is clearly charging Morne from behind at which point she engages and overpowers him. So Draco is the equivalent of Sora in that fight and still lost.There is also the point where Cade who is no where near krayts level as a swordsman or force user over powered Draco by himself when he found him and kreig had followed the mynock. and kreig himself thinks somebody like Vao might be better than both him and Draco.As for Caedus vs. kyle there is absolutely nothing in that scene to suggest Katarn ever held an advantage over Caedus. When he attacked Caedus and Caedus deflected it he executed a lightning fast spin and Caedus casually stepped back and watched it buzz past harmlessly. Additionally When Katarn tried to kick him in the Face he would have had his leg amputated had it not been for Kolir intercepting his blade. So there you have evidence that had Katarn done that move without the other Jedi to coordinate with he would have been crippled then likely killed. Without the speeder. He also negligently swatted away Katarns lightsaber after he threw it at him. Then while fighting the Jedi he diverted his attention to track the trajectory of the speeder if you are hard pressed in the middle of a fight or desperate you do not have the luxury of diverting your attention elsewhere. But once again no where in that fight did it ever make it out to be that Caedus was having any trouble against katarn. In fact the only point they got a hit on him was after Katarn had been taken out of the fight while he was Disinterestedly blocking Mithrics attacks and it was due to him not being able to maintain focus because his injuries from Luke were adding up and so he didnt realize Valin had deflected the blaster bolt at him and even then He was skilled enough to parry a blow from Mithric and deflect a blaster bolt into his chest with a single move forcing himself to focus on two threats at once while on his knees.,StarWarsEU,czxt9v3,1,t5_2tg71

6704548,0,t1_d0co0uz,I dont buy it. There was plenty of time the Emperor was in Vaders hands that he could have done anything to get free such as Force push Vader etc. There is almost no consistency to his power and the problem with Dark Empire is that they turned him into a Gokutype character in terms of what he could do which was too much for me to believe considering everything else we had seen in the EU up until then. Only Vitiate comes close and I hate that character as well.  Credits arent necessary when the labor force is all indoctrinated slaves.  Resources is true but the EU regarding Starkiller states the crystalline deposits were already in the planet so like I said it probably took less resources than the Death Stars which would require miningmanufacturing the building materials hauling it into space then constructing it rather than just doing it all on the moon itself I consider Starkiller a bigger moondwarf planet due to its size.  Manpower true as well but as we know they had the manpower. It makes sense theyd use most their resources on a superweapon. The EU makes it pretty clear that the New Republic was the dominant military force in the galaxy and the First Order would have stood no chance in an open conflict. Starkiller though destroyed completely evened the playing field. If it had survived there is no doubt the FO would have secured dominance instantly. ,StarWarsEU,d0ct3x3,1,t5_2tg71

Those products were officially labelled Expanded Universe and Lucasfilm regarded it as the Expanded Universe. One can say Legends discussion amp Canon discussion or Expanded Universe amp Canon interchangeably but saying new EU and old EU is just simply incorrect both factually and in regards to what Lucasfilm thinks. While this sub according to your statement and previous statements  is for discussion both of Expanded Universe and Canon or Legends and Canon materials that is fine. But please dont call the new material New EU when it has never been called that its just inaccurate and confuses people and simply isnt true.

6811745,0,t3_48x477,EU simply means Expanded Universe encompassing everything that isnt the core films. It just so happens that all the older EU content has been rebranded as Legends due to it not fitting the new canon and being an uncoordinated mess in places. Just because newer EU stuff is all part of the same canon doesnt mean the meaning of EU has changed. Its still expanding on the universe we see in the films which are the core of the franchise. Hence why this sub welcomes discussion of newer nonLegends material as well as the Legends we all love.Personally Im a fan of both and I find people who are a fan of one and not the other very confusing. Both Legends and the new canon have a mixed bag of quality and ultimately theyre all stories about Star Wars. Ive never seen anyone saying dont read the old stuff check out the new stuff instead but I have seen plenty of helpful posts on here recommending books from both canons depending on theme. To say you dont like the new canon based on a couple of stories seems narrowminded to me. If someone said they didnt like Legends and it turned out theyd only read Children of the Jedi and The Crystal Star then that would hardly be surprising. So far the new canon books have been okay at best with only a couple being genuinely good books IMO so far but the new EU is still young. Rather that blowing  on new hardbacks Ive been waiting reading reviews and spending  on paperbacks for the ones that interest me.EDIT After rereading your post and some of your other comments OP it seems I missed your point. Apologies. You just want people who like the newer stuff to stop barging in on threads about the old stuff and shitting on it. I think thats a fair request so long as the same can be asked the other way. If people are discussing the new EU stuff Legends fans shouldnt come in and shit on the new stuff. I mean sure at this point if youre going to go one or the other Legends has a pretty big head start and much more material so of course there are more books that are good but there are also more that arent. As I said above Im personally in the why not both camp and the whole one vs. the other seems quite silly but hey ho.,StarWarsEU,d0oepo7,3,t5_2tg71

JJ Abrams is a safe pair of hands as a director. At the same time as he doesnt make bad films he doesnt make excellent ground breaking movies. His niche is good pictures which are visually engaging movies that have mass appeal. Hes a solid  director. Arguably after the prequels that is what the franchise needed for its big public relaunch. No one is going to seriously argue that TFA didnt resemble ANH but in a way it is what the franchise needed. This is why Ive got a different deeper anticipation for Episode  and . Rian Johnson is a very good director who has made well written and tightly scripted films that have been thematically and technically excellent strong  Im thinking specifically of Brick and Looper. Hes directing Episode  and hes writing Episode  and that has me very excited. The series been given a solid safe platform from which to build and now hopefully Johnson takes it in interesting new directions.

I mean while I like the Disney is being more inclusive it does feel a little bit like pandering to me at times. ,StarWarsEU,d6d472l,1,t5_2tg71

8817812,0,t3_50uzvs,I still have mixed feelings.One the one hand its awesome that the character is canon and more importantly is getting a book written by Zahn.  Also Lars Mikkelsen while a surprising choice seems perfect for the role.On the other hand its not going to be my Thrawn.  Its going to be a version of him that will share some similarities but ultimately wont be the character I love.  So much of what I love about the character comes from what he does who he interacts with characters that will clearly no longer exist.  A future that no longer exists and a backstory that may or may not.Im looking forward to Zahns take but Id prefer another EU story.Also I dont entirely trust anyone other than Zahn to write the character appropriately. ,StarWarsEU,d77s4mv,18,t5_2tg71

I feel youre right on the new canon I think were gonna most grow  in the areas within and around the OT and wont get much PostRotjPreTFA stuff still Episode . But I figured the OT era EU would have grown a lot more by now especially with Rogue One coming out.Ive watched Rebels up to the beginning of season  and its not quite as enjoyable as Clone Wars for me personally but I see that theres more Maul Vader and Ahsoka. Ill have to give it a chance but the dark tone of later Clone Wars is what won me over. I reaaaly hope Rebels gets back to that.

10254517,0,t3_5mqige,In legends yes. Both Death Stars had significant civilian populations mostly contract workers wookiees slaves who built the Death Stars and regular civilian staff. Technically the rebels should be considered terrorists they just happen to be our POV characters is most Star Wars works and are presented as the good guys. Also most of the military personnel were regular grunts and werent evil. One of the things I liked about the EU was that it showed the moral grey areas within the Star Wars universe. The novel Death Star is from the  perspective of Imperial gruntscivilians on the Death Star leading up to and during the battle of Yavin. Its a really good book imo which adds to ANH. ,StarWarsEU,dc6em22,5,t5_2tg71
10274443,0,t1_dc8m0g5,I respect your feeling and I admit I havent read much new SW stuff but Ive done a  the other way.   In the decade before disney on the internet I really got sick of arrogant EU fans and their resentful spite every time any discussion on the SW universe there would be a bunch of bitter comments fake fans who cant be bothered to read about the real SW  those of us who really care about SW have to hear this crap from lazy people who cant be bothered to pick a book up..and I was wickedly happy to imagine all those arrogant petty people having their claim to ego instantaneously whisked out from under them.However since seeing TFA and skimming some new books Im starting to miss that sense of grand majesty the EU novels had that sense of being IN the SW universe they used to give me in the s and I think they are underrated in being one of the only sci fifantasy series that deals with a what happens after the happy ending type theme.   Maybe Brandon Sanderson has done stuff like that now but it was unique then.The futures for the characters and government just seem more magical in the EU now and it feels more right to me.I do still think it was stupid how some EU fans constantly boasted about being the keepers of the real story when Lucas made it clear he would overwrite in a second if he felt like it.  It should have been valued for its quality not its canon status.,StarWarsEU,dc8nwop,18,t5_2tg71

11672636,0,t1_dginzqg,Mhm I dont think that Yoda is that flashy yes hes more flashy than some one like Vader simply due to the fact that Ataru is flashy style. Flashy was maybe the wrong term. What I ment is unorthodox and Im sorry if I expressed my self poorly in that regard.Like I said and I stand by that Yoda and Exar Kuns fighting styles are superficially simillar but thats it and I think that that has more to do with the fact that Niman takes Elements from Ataru and Exar Kun seems to focus more on the offensive elements of Niman. The diffrence lies in their mindset and application of their respective forms. Yoda only uses only the basics of his style and elevates them to the nthdegree because that is all he ever needsneeded and furthermore he does not enjoy combat so he wont go out of his way to explore anyything fancy  sticking with the tried and true. Kun on the other hand revals in the unorthodox and almost seems to despise the basic of his chosen style. Which for Niman is Moderation and Balance  the complete opposite of Exar Kun. Exar Kun loved the unorthodox parts of his Style. To give a metaforic representation of their styles imo of course. Both are spheres with the same mass but Exar Kuns is bigger. But there is a twist to it. Exar Kuns sphere has no core there is no basis un which is build upon. Both hit hard but The chance of collapse is higher wwith the big hollow sphere than the the small and condensed one. Dooku on the other hand is not a sphere he is a cone. When the solid sphere hits him hes more likely to bend than not. But when the hollow sphere comes he will penetrate through the hull and collapsing the sphere. As for Kuns victories over Vodo and Sylvar he hand some logistical advantages he would not have against dooku. He was Vodos student and spared more than once with Sylvar. He has an familliarty with Vodos and Sylvars style. Speaking of Sylvars style Im not sure if shes a makashi specialist I always so her has a ShiiChoAtaru hybrid. In my opinion she gets way to emotional in fights. But even if she was one I dont think that this would give him a huge advantage over Dooku. For serveral reasons I find it hard to belief that the style has not evolved over the course of roughly  years. Also I dont think that a famillarity with a style gives you that much of an Advantage. Espeacially in this case assuming that Sylvar uses Makashi she applies it very diffrently. She is a storm of emotion while Dooku is calm and collected. Also I dont believe that two applications of the same form are the same. I mean look at real fencer for example I study the treatise by Joachim Meyer same does everybody in the club. And I can fight pretty well against one guy because he lives near me and we sparr every other day. But as soon as we do sparring in the club and I sparr against some one else my chances of winning decline massively. Espeacially if some one comes in who has trained under a diffrent instructor. Even if they should have the same technique on paper how they apply it in combat is so diffrent from my style or my freinds style that my famillarity with the theoratical side of the style has almost no real use.  And with Silvar and Dooku there is even one more factor the diffrence in Skill I believe that while no pushover Sylvar is on the levels of an JediKnight. A compotent one at that I would say somewhere between Aayla Secura and AtoC Kenobi. While Dooku is certainly one of the Top  duelists of his time. But if Kun did not use Trakata against Sylvar which I totally forgot even though Sylvar is one of my all time favourite underrated characters than I doubt that he would employ them for an extend amount of time against Dooku. But I think that he will try to use it against Dooku based on my Argument earlier that he is not to familliar with dookus style. So while I still think Dooku takes this one in more cases than not I see it more around a  chance for Dooku.I have not read that one yet and Im afraid that I can not comment much on that because I do not know much abou them. My knowledge of post RotJ lore is quite lacking. Its been at least decade since I read anything from that period.,StarWarsEU,dgj3ya0,1,t5_2tg71
