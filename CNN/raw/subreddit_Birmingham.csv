I wouldnt call it strong though as people drive like maniacs in here.. they act like the mph sign doesnt exist.. average speed is about  mph I kid you not. I have met a few people here.. I would consider this a lower income apartment complex for this area  I only know one person with a job that supports his whole family and he wants to move ASAP.  Nothing wrong with this place if you are young but I wouldnt want to raise a kid here. Drugs are very prevalent  I can see  known usersdealers to support their habbit doors from my door and no one really notices the traffic because there are over  units in this complex.   Recently about  months ago i reckon Police blocked off both entrances to catch a dealer they knew lived here.. He ended up driving his car into the lake from the round circle for guest parking in front of the complex.  Its not the worst place ive lived.. Its not the best either.  Personally Im leaving as soon as my lease is up in Aug.  My AC was out for about  days last summer.. it would work one week and not the next until they replaced the furnace and unit outside.. it was fall by then though.

2221299,0,t3_2kj3sm,I lived in Alabama until I was  then Missouri from  then back to Alabama here in Birmingham for the past  years.  I dont believe my mother brought any culinary influence back from Missouri.  Both of my grandmothers would cook the stereotypical Southern dishes  fried chicken mashed potatoes greens butterbeans cornbread sweet tea...etc. and this was a big event at Thanksgiving and Christmas as well as on any other visits.  I would visit one set of grandparents for some time each summer and the food was the same  so they ate like that all of the time and eating together was a must.  This was passed on to my mother a better cook than both of my grandmothers who applied butterfat...etc. extremely liberally.  My mother is the nd best cook I have ever known next to an older black lady who was the nannyhousekeepercook for my former boss  and even though they were  years apart in age had very similar traditional Southern cooking styles although both were carefully restrained in the use of butterfat in cooking.My parents brothers family and I try to regularly eat together every weekend as a family and mom often cooks.  We do not have family recipes since my mother can usually just throw something together in less than an hour that could feed an army.  Through the course of time she has become more health conscious and there have been more baked and less fried foods and fried in more healthy ways.Traditional Southern food is evolving with health concerns and alternative ways of cooking it are evolving as well to maintain the heart of the flavor without extreme amounts of butterfat.  Food is an important part of being Southern since the table means fellowship and communion among friends family and guests.  Its as much about eating together as what you eat.  There is also a misperception about some Southern foods  that fried chicken or catfish collard greens watermelon...etc. are stereotypically food eaten by black folks.  This is simply not true.  More accurately these are foods eaten by many poor people because they are readily available and cheap.  I know because we were poor for many years and these were our go to luxuries when we could afford them.    ,Birmingham,clm6i6f,2,t5_2r3nd

Co. for arguments sake. Youd go to District Court and the judge will say can you afford a lawyer or do we need to appoint you one. You can be sentenced to up to  days so they have to appoint you one if you qualify as indigent. Are you going to jail? DoubtfulOnce you have a lawyer the prosecutor will give you exculpatory material or colloquially discovery. Thats what the police were talking about. They have to give you anything beneficial to you related to guilt or punishment. Basically youll get the police report and if theres a video then that. You dont subpoena it they just give it to you once requested.If its in Jeff. Co. they will offer you likely community service and dismiss it assuming its your first and you dont have a crazy criminal history and didnt fight the cops. Since youre only charged with PI from your post I dont think you have an issue.Just my two cents. Take it for what its worth.Like uderpderpdonkeypunch said if your concern is keeping your criminal record immaculate then bite the bullet and get a lawyer.

All of them are places that you go in order to have on your resume and get experience so that you can later go elsewhere and earn more money.  The exception in there would be Frank Stitts places Highlands Fonfon and Bottega.  When youve been working there long enough its my understanding that you wind up accruing ownership interest and I think that they may be more generous with handing out raises for people that have been there for a long time than Hot amp Hot or Ocean.    While its not fine dining but upper end casual Primeaux at the Summit has been putting out great food recently.  Those are the folks that also own Dixie Fish and if you were looking to potentially move up Dixie would be the place to go.  I think theyre having trouble finding people of the caliber that they want and are also willing to pay a little more.    In terms of you coming off as too expensive when applying for jobs it doesnt matter how much you put down on your application as wanting to make per hour.  If a place wants you theyll make an offer.

Well hire you at your requested hourly rate then one of two things has happened  What you are asking for was within what they were willing to pay anyway so no biggie or  You dont want to be working there anyway because not bargaining down an hourly rate may very well show bad business sense and an inability to control costs so the place will be going down at some point in the nearish future anyway.,Birmingham,ctp1tzv,2,t5_2r3nd

Long story short a guy pulled a baseball bat on myself and girlfriend. I drew my weapon on him when he was about ft away and gave him verbal commands several times to turn around and get back in his vehicle but he kept coming came from across the street to begin with and he still continued coming another ft after my gun was drawn which really surprised me before he stopped because I would have expected someone with a gun pointing at them to stop in their tracks. He still continued to curse me and tell me how bad hes going to beat my ass when he sees me again even though he had no idea who I was why my gun stayed pointing at him. He was very clearly drunk or messed up on something.I was so glad he stopped as I really did not want to shoot him and go through all that legal mess but had he came another few feet I was ready to start shooting.,Birmingham,cyr6mht,9,t5_2r3nd

The park had gotten really terrible by that point and you could see trash and panties floating in the lazy river regularly. To revamp the park Larry Langford decided to spend two million dollars on animatronic dinosaurs to create a live action dino park. There were no sensors or security around the dinosaurs at all there were also no cameras. I saw the dino park two weeks after it had opened and it had  been torn to pieces by vandals. Halfway through the trail there was an allosaurus with the anarchy sign spray painted on its chest. Its head had been cut off and it was holding it in its hands. It still looked around and roared animatronically though. To this day I have never seen a better symbol for the implosion of government.

If someone was parking an  wheeler in front of my house Id be pissed too.  Having the legal right to do something doesnt mean that its always okay to do that thing.  Youre smart enough to not equate legality with whether or not something is right or wrong and in pretending to do so and phrasing it in the way you do youre being a dick.

8832540,0,t1_d79eca2,gt  There is no amnesty for forced or underaged prostitution so yo legal immigrant cant report her own trafficking without getting prosecuted.FYI this isnt true.It is unclear what you think they would be prosecuted for.  You wrote legal immigrant but I will assume you mean prosecuted for being illegal. Certainly you dont mean prosecuted for being a victim of human trafficking.  Either way you are incorrect.  There are actually special visas that only people who have been victims of crimes can get UVisa YVisa so that they are allowed to legally stay in the country while their case is pending and then segway that into legal status.  After all if the person that was trafficking them is being prosecuted the victim would be needed to proceed and would have to stay in the country for that to happen.  There is also a multijurisdictional human trafficking task force that has the resources to intervene in cases where there is suspected human trafficking.  The task force includes both local branches of federal agencies and state agencies.  While all the knowledge may not trickle all the way down to every boots on the ground BPD officer there are certainly resources and protocols in place.  ,Birmingham,d79jpwh,2,t5_2r3nd

10265566,0,t3_5mzvtv,Welcome! Birmingham is a really cool city with a lot to offer.  Youre likely to get the most valuable answers by sharing a bit of additional information regarding what youre looking for specifically.  An example of some details to include would be price range if you have children andor are looking for good school zones looking rural or urban would prefer less than a XX minute drive to job in the YY area prefer fooddrink options within walking distance and the sort.A random suggestion based on my personal experiences of nice areas to live would be to check out the Rocky Ridge  Old Rocky Ridge area of Hoover.  My wife and I lived in that area for  years and miss it very much.  We were zoned for Spain Park  and while we dont have children that worked in our favor when selling.  This location is conveniently located to most areas that people get out to in the area  namely it was very close to the shopping of Hoover a quick shot to the Inverness section of  and had convenient paths to both the east and west sides of the downtown area.  Also in their community there are some nice amenity offerings including one of our nicer groceries Rocky Ridge Western The Ridge Eat and Drink pubAmerican food a Moes BBQ A Twisted Root Burger  tasty Mexican restaurants a couple of gas stations and more.  Also on the commute front  is usually one of the smoother flowing major trafficways here so it usually made getting to and from work a shorter trek than is the case for many  additionally there are MANY old windy backroads to get you to the same places if youre looking to avoid major highways and interstates.Anywhos!

10870335,0,t1_de0vdk2,Ultimately the goal of the IRS when it comes to an income tax return is to make the amount as close to  either way with no large refund or large payment. The problem is that people like the idea of a refund so many people change their withholding to allow for a refund. That combined with refundable credits allows the majority of people to receive a refund and the average is a few thousand dollars. As one person hinted at if you are married with no children and make even ok money it is pretty hard to ever get a significant refund on federal taxes. There just arent very many credits you can claim and with the low mortgage interest rates relatively low home prices in AL low property taxes it is hard to get into itemization territory which would typically lead to a refund. Even with that said the mortgage interest deduction is probably the biggest myth in personal income tax filing. It just doesnt do much for many people. You should however get a pretty decent refund from Alabama because you can deduct FICA and federal income taxes in AL one of only a handful of states that allow such. Theoretically your wifes withholding should have made some sort of difference but it does depend on the specific numbers involved. The number of exemptions that were specified will also affect things.,Birmingham,de174h0,2,t5_2r3nd

Have a good idea of your need before talking to a gun store employee about the subject it helps them out as much as it helps you.Given that you need one for home protection I recommend looking into fullsized handguns since concealibility is not an issue. If you can swing it I would recommend a semi auto rifle as they are easier to learn how to fire well and are more effective.
