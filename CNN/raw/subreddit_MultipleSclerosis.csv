You probably arent meeting with your new team today or hosting a cook out or if you are you will be sitting and delegating the work to others. There is a very good chance you will get your legs back. I read all the time about people who lost one function or another but regained it. Of course you are scared. Im scared too. Just the other day my husband told me he didnt think I was telling him how I really feel about having MS. I was just diagnosed in October. I explained that Im terrified. Every day is something different. I feel different all the time. New sensations pains feeling detached from my leg losing control of one finger and bladder issues. The thing is I dont want to live in that terrified place all the time. Thats not going to help me so I just face each day as a new challenge. I talk about my MS enough and I dont want my family and friends to get sick of hearing about it especially my husband. I know this is easy for me to say today since I have use of my legs but tomorrow I may not. Like you I could wake up tomorrow without them.  I hope you have a good support system. I am lucky to have a great husband and I hope yours is as amazing as mine. I hope the feeling comes back to your legs quickly. I hope you get to relax today and enjoy the cookout while others do the work. I wish I could give you a hug and lend you my shoulder to cry on. I wish there was something I could say to make it better but I know there isnt. All I can do is hope so I do. I have hope for you and for the rest of us. ,MultipleSclerosis,cg90xmq,9,t5_2s23e

1237371,0,t1_ci8afhq,Yes the MS clinic in my area has set up an appointment for me to meet with the nurse for a medication education session this Friday in fact. Theyre going to start me on Copaxone. I dont want to go on antidepressants. Ive tried quite a few over the years Ive been chronically depressed since I was a small child without any relief from medication or therapy or anything else and generally I found they made the suicidal feelings worse because then I just was numb to everything good or bad. Not sure if that makes sense but its a scary feeling and I dont want that again. Especially not now when Im already feeling like walking into traffic isnt such a bad plan. I havent heard of occupational rehabilitation. What is that? Sounds interesting. I shouldve gotten a degree when I was younger but my health was crappy then too so I put it off while I worked and kept it on the back burner that I would do it when I felt better. I finally felt pretty good when I was about  and made plans to go back to school and get a better jobincome which was something I finally was able to start doing since I moved here. I found a program I really like and was accepted and doing well. The problem is that my education will cost so much same as anyone else but Im not optimistic about how long I will be physically able to work which makes it not worth getting the degree. On paper Id be better off sticking to a lowerpaying job for the next  years than I would getting the degree working to pay it all back and only breaking even around the  year mark. After that assuming I could still work Id make significantly more of course but Im really not sure that its worth the gamble. Its super disappointing after all these years sorting out what I wanted to do for a career getting into university finally and then realizing its maybe too late.He is my best friend and theres a lot of security with staying in the relationship. I wouldnt have to worry about being looked after should I become totally disabled and thats no small thing! People always say to marry your best friend... but what if your best friend isnt also someone youre attracted to!? Thats kinda where Im stuck. I cant have children especially not in this relationship as its just not an option but it bothers me that Ill be alone when Im older. My bf is significantly older than I am  yrs apart and I may very well outlive him too. I dont have any outside family for support and now that Ive moved I dont have any friends here. I keep trying to make some but its not been easy and Im very isolated. The culture here is very cliqueish... like if youre from away youre automatically not accepted. Its weird and something I didnt think Id be faced with as I generally get along quite well and have a lot of friends back home. Thanks for your kindness and understanding.

While MS never truly goes away I have met people that havent had episodes in over a decade.  A true flare up can last months and sometimes symptoms are permanent.  That being said never lose hope that the symptoms will fade with time.Regardless of anything else D IS proven to in general help with bone health and your immune system.

If you think youre in the wrong body check out rasktransgender rtransgender rTransSupport and maybe rtranseducate. I cant imagine what youre dealing with but the people there can lend a supportive shoulder. Youre not an abomination. Homosexuality and bisexuality arent disturbing or wrong  they just are.

2834538,0,t3_2sgkp0,Hey brother  Im completely with you. My wife was diagnosed with MS at   months after we met shes now almost . Her initial diagnosis of RRMS has progressed to secondary progressive although the doc is careful not to document this because insurance stops covering meds  theyve only been testedapproved for RRMS not SPMS so of COURSE insurance uses that as a way to back out.In that time shes progressed from minor inconveniences  fatigue  to the point where shes mostly bedridden now. She has a lot of mental issues now  confusion slurred words HUUUUGE angeremotional issues. Of course being the one thats closest to her Ive taken the brunt of the anger. Granted  I have my own anger issues and I can give just as well as I get unfortunately. I have a temper that she can tap into completely unintentionally and that certainly doesnt help the situation.Counseling is a help  for both of you together or on your own. It helps having a neutral third party that you can just unload on. Even if youre not looking for advice just the act of being able to vent is a huuuuuge help.One of the things thats helped me is breaking down what I need to do into specific jobs  cleaning her changing the sheets getting her bathed getting her dressed feeding her etc  and then focusing on that job in front of me. Its hard because Ill be in the middle of one thing and shell be talking about something five steps ahead or criticizing what Im doing. But I try to take a deep breath and focus before replying to her and before letting myself get angry!. It doesnt always work but it does help.Another thing that drives me nuts is having to repeat the same thing or answer the same question  times in a row. Well ok thats an exaggeration but it feels that way. And when I get mad about that and snap at her she doesnt understand because to her she just asked a simple question and suddenly Im biting her head off.Anyway yeah I absolutely sympathize with you.

4073783,0,t3_378oy5,I took rebif for about a year and I hatred it. Not because of the needles. Here is what I learned about injections. The auto injectors hurt dont work well and the hurt. Also they hurt. Stop using the auto injector.Now the idea of giving yourself a shot is scary I get that. But I have a couple tricks that really help. They will also help with auto injector but trust me that thing never sucks less.  take an advil about an hour before your shot. This isnt for the pain of the needle its to reduce inflammation after. pick your shot location and put a warm compress on it for at least five minutes before your shot. This relaxes the tissue and increases blood flow. Also helps with inflammation. pinch an inch of skin and pull it away from your body. This is the part you cant do with the auto injector. You want to angle the needle a little bit. Remember you are trying to get the injection under the skin but not in the muscle. My skin is thin and I have no body fat so the injector always hit muscle or tendon.  rotate your injection sites. Back of the upper arm lower outer side of stomach just above your waist band top of the thigh near the joint top of the butt near you back. Keep a log of wear you last injected and move in order alternating sides of your body. It should be a couple weeks between reusing any given location. Some locations are easier than others. this is the hardest one but makes the biggest difference after throwing out the auto injector. Push the needle in then push the plunger SLOWLY. The tissue is all connected. Its really not very much fluid but it still has to go someplace. The auto injector pumps it in super fast. It makes a blister kind of. But going slowly the fluid spreads out more. Trust me I know this seems like the worst idea cause you just want the whole thing done. But between the hot compress and going slowly you will have much less physical pain. And once it doesnt hurt it isnt as scary.Let me know if anything isnt clear or you have any questions.,MultipleSclerosis,crkmz1q,7,t5_2s23e

One thing that would work for a friend would do nothing for me. Eventually I had great success with reflexology. I was so hesitant a first but tried it at the recommendation of a friend who also had MS. I found it gave me more energy throughout the day.

5338938,0,t1_cvu1a9a,Interesting. I didnt think there was enough testing done to allow DMTs to be continued up until pregnancy. I found this article  about MS Family Planning.gt Stopping DMTs to get pregnantIndeed the advice is for patients to stop taking all currently available DMTs for  or more months before becoming pregnant. Even though patients such as Bonnie know that none of the DMTs are  effective or curative the drugs do reduce the risk of relapse and some other measures of disease progression. While patients and clinicians want to avoid causing damage to the fetus this leaves patients trying to have a baby at risk for new relapses at least until the poorly understood protective effects of pregnancy go into effect.I suggest asking your doctor what sources they have to continue the drug up until the positive pregnancy or why theyre suggesting it when other sources say the opposite? Most likely your doctor would have way more knowledge specifically to your own MS about the situation and you should trust them but itd be a good idea to understand their reasoning. ,MultipleSclerosis,cvu3wrt,1,t5_2s23e

Theyll tell you everything will work out because they dont want you to hurt anymore than you already are. I feel stupid bringing up my fears to my friends because they just dont get it. Luckily my best friend and roommate also has some health issues and shes experiencing similar things that Im going through. If you dont have someone you feel fully comfortable with I strongly recommend counselling. Ive been going for a couple months now and its really changed the way Ive been dealing with everything.The biggest thing that hit me was babies. Im  so Im in my prime age to be popping them little suckers out. But because none of the MS approved medication has been tested during pregnancy none of the drugs can be used while getting or becoming pregnant. My life changed in the sense that I decided Im not going to have biological kids. I decided I didnt want to be constantly thinking about my child having MS and be overly watchful parent thinking that every cold is a symptom. I also didnt want to be the person that caused this shit storm for someone else even if the possibility of passing it off is low. I also didnt want to have the possibility of a relapse after giving birth where it would prevent me from properly providing for my child. I wouldnt want to have to rely on a support system to look after my kid I also have very limited people to rely on so that was a huge factor for me. But those are just my thoughts and how I am choosing to handle my life. My family is also sure my Grandpa had MS he and my Grandma originally stated he had it after seeing a specialist and then a couple months later told everyone it was nothing  we think he was embarrassed so it probably runs in my family.That said there are tons of women who have had children before and after their diagnosis with no issues.There is nothing I can say to make you feel better about pregnancy. Every person is different. You have to weigh your pros and cons and then go for whatever you feel is best. There is no wrong answer in what you choose to do! Plus it seems that majority of women have a easy time during the pregnancy. MS seems to be staved off during those pregnancy months. As for making some positive changes in your life YES! I had the same mind frame before I was diagnosed. I knew i should be eating properly but I would eat crappy food like every other human. I knew I should exercise more but I didnt. Now I look at it like I dont really have a fucking choice. Its either I take care of myself now or I continue to waste my life and let my MS win.For myself I chose the Swank diet but I feel like just eating more veggies and less processed foods is a good start. I cut out caffeine and alcohol personal choice but limiting would probably be okay too. I take  IUs of vitamin D and a tbsp of fish oil every day. My neurologist had a seminar a couple weeks ago and really pushed daily exercise  of both physical and mental. He recommended doing puzzles like Sudoku and Lumosity. He said the effects of one hour of both were so incredible that if it came in a pill everyone would take it.Your life is not over its just different. It might make you a bit bitter to realize other people arent going to work as hard for their lives as youre going to but theres nothing you can do about it. Its either you take control over the things you can control or you dont and live a bit more difficultly. The choice is yours.Im sorry youre having such a hard time. Its not easy but I promise you will start to feel more like yourself eventually. There will always be days where youre going to be sad and want to give up but thats not uncommon. Let yourself grieve and realize its okay for you to experience anger sadness depression etc. Let yourself experience these emotions but dont dwell on them too much. Just take it one day at a time and try to relax as much as possible.If you ever want to PM me. I love talking clearly and MS is one of my new passions haha.,MultipleSclerosis,cxdy2bw,4,t5_2s23e

Some people are really into knowing everything about MS and the treatments and the latest research and some are totally fine just doing what their doctors tell them. It sounds like your GF is one of the latter which is fine. You dont HAVE to be an expert on MS to be an expert about your MS. After this many years shes the only one who is going to be able to offer any additional advice about her MS to you. My only advice is just to listen and watch learn the little signs that shes tired or hurting or used her spoons so you can be proactive. But listen to her if she wants to push ahead anyhow.

Your balance is based on input from your eyes looking at horizons your ear canal which tells you if your head is vertical and your pressure sensors in your skin especially feet. These are all processed and combined to keep you coordinated and upright. Any delays or disruption to those signals can cause nausea. And MS causes delay and disruption to those signals.  You will learn to compensate over time but in the short term have you tried closing your eyes before moving? Its one less input for you to consolidate.

I was under the impression that it meant the lesions are in the T and T areas of the spinal cord I have T and T lesions as well as some appearing in my brain. In reference to MRIs...From Quoragt . Tweighted imaging is used to differentiate anatomical structures mainly on the basis of T values i.e. the scanning parameters are set short TRshort TE to minimize T relaxation effects. Tissues with high fat content e.g. white matter appear bright and compartments filled with water e.g. CSF appears dark. This is good for demonstrating anatomy.gt . Tweighted imaging is used to differentiate anatomical structures mainly on the basis of T values i.e. the scanning parameters are set long TRlong TE to minimize T relaxation effects. Compartments filled with water e.g. CSF compartments appear bright and tissues with high fat content e.g. white matter appear dark. This is good for demonstrating pathology since most not all lesions are associated with an increase in water content.This just says they are measured differently depending on what you want to see.Medscapegt On T images of the CNS the cerebrospinal fluid CSF appears dark gray or black the white matter light gray and the gray matter a darker gray. Some MS lesions may appear as dark gray or black on T. These indicate increased water content and axonal disruption. On T with contrast the blood vessels appear bright and any areas of blood brain barrier disruption will appear bright. Gd is normally prohibited from entry into the CNS tissue by an intact blood brain barrier.gt In an active MS lesion the blood brain barrier is disrupted allowing immune system cells into the brain. At this time the contrast medium may also enter the brain causing the active lesion to appear bright. Acute lesions can remain enhanced for approximately  weeks.gt T images can show MS lesions of any age new inflammatory lesions or old more chronic lesions. On T the white matter appears dark gray and the gray matter light gray. The CSF is bright white as are the MS lesions. FLAIR is used to suppress the signal from the CSF so the MS lesions are more easily seen. This is useful for seeing supratentorial lesions particularly in the periventricular white matter.I dont think one is worse than the other.,MultipleSclerosis,d5yxa10,1,t5_2s23e

8932883,0,t3_52m8vp,I just moved to a city where the health industry is basically monopolized by  companies each requiring you to see a PCP before being referred to a specialist. Ive flat out been told that I cant go straight to a specialist because they dont believe that people need really need to see a specialist or know what theyre talking about.  I was even told that I couldnt even schedule time with a neurologist without my MS being confirmed by one of their doctors and sending my entire medical record to them.  Oh and you need a specialist? Expect at least a  week wait. So fucking different from what Im used to. Also they choose the specialist you go to and they schedule for you. You basically have no control over your own health care. It took  yrs to diagnose my MS because multiple PCPs told me I was stressed and fat without doing anything more than a blood test. New symptoms started up. And now I need to find a doctor that will not see being fat as a catchall and will take my claims seriously even if tests come back normal.  I cant tell you how often tests come back normal so apparently that means nothing is wrong!

8983816,0,t1_d7rmo1x,I have had absolutely no side effects. I feel that it has been effective in regards to relapses and progression. I have had MS for  years and Gilenya was the first medication that I was able to be on longer than a few months so there had already been some progression before I began. I also take Ampyra and I feel that they work very well together. I have to say that the most frustrating thing with both Gilenya and Ampyra is insurance companiesdoctors. The agency that I work for recently changed insurance companies. Both of those medications are preauthorizations. The company is giving my doctor TWO months to get in documentation for the preauth and the doctor is taking her sweet time. I have been out of Gilenya for about a month and I definitely notice a difference so I would say that speaks highly of how it works.

The first few years of diagnosis I really struggled with this feeling. I just wanted to not have this damn disease and I would think maybe if I stop giving it any attention and maybe if I just kind of pretend it isnt there Id be better off. Denial is a part of the Five Stages of Grief that many of us go through when we get diagnosed. I was told by a wonderful therapist who also had MS that grieving an MS diagnosis can take up to  years. Perhaps more or less for some people. Once I learned about the grieving process it really helped me to understand what was going on with me that it was normal and to have compassion for myself. You also get to control who when and how you tell people about your diagnosis and symptoms so take control there. Although please tell your doctors everything!

10666528,0,t3_5sheup,Im glad you posted this Im very worried that I am not being the right kind of support for my recently diagnosed boyfriend. I have worked in medicine for about ish years the last  being with cancer patients. Terminal illness is kind of my thing so I tend not to get doom and gloom over many illnesses that are not glioblastoma. I am going to nursing school to be an oncology nurse. So when my boyfriend told me on our third date he had a bout of acute transverse myelitis the seed was planted in my mind very early that it was a big possibility he would end up with MS. Then I noticed he was having symptoms of periodic limb movement disorder but he assured me it was just because he didnt stretch before bed. Once he stayed the night on a friday night and I had clinicals at am the next morning. His leg movements shook the whole bed every  seconds and kept me up all night until I finally silently moved to the couch. I think him waking up to me on the couch and worsening headaches was what made him actually see a doctor. The problem is he internalizes everything. He doesnt talk about his feelings much gets really mean when his anxiety is high and smokes a fair bit of weed to self medicate that anxiety. I am the opposite I cant shut up and constantly laugh. I love medicine and knowing the ins and outs of everything I possibly can. I also am very grounded in what a diagnosis could mean for the future of a patient. I am almost immediately entering into that healthcare worker role where I want to make sure he is ok and that he knows I am a pretty damn good resource in this. He hasnt wanted to talk about it at all. He doesnt want to go out and do things but thats not any different from before which works currently because I cant really go out and do anything either unless I have some sort of nursing study materials by my side. I am so worried about him entering an anxiety and depression spiral but I dont know how to confront it without pissing him off. I love him Im in this I am not going anywhere unless he literally pushes me out the door. In the same aspect I have special insight that he doesnt on what steps to take to possibly make his quality of life better and I really want to be able to help him work towards that I dont want him to face this alone. I am scared shitless for what this means for our future but I am more scared  about how he is imploding. I dont know how to approach it.,MultipleSclerosis,ddg66gy,2,t5_2s23e

I have a good memory for music so I play my favorite musicals in my head with my eyes closed.  Its not prefect but it helps. My old therapist used to say that if you dont practice the mindfulness stuff when you dont need to it wont work when you do. Im sure you were doing it just at home too but trying it with a goal in mind never really worked for me. It was when I gave up having a goal and just stayed in the moment and didnt expect anything of my brain or body that it finally started helping.Again it doesnt work all the time and it sure as heck isnt does everyone. Nine times out Id ten I think its bull but on occasion or has been there for me.I really hope you find something that helps. Its really the only thing that can genuinely help your doctor treat you. If I could do it for you I would. I know how scary it can be. ,MultipleSclerosis,dfu6n56,1,t5_2s23e
11454576,0,t1_dfuc5bz,There was never a big jump. Thats what surprised her doctors. She was so low on her titers that nobody was concerned. It was a routine MRI that showed the suspicious looking lesions.He never urged her to switch he always left the ball in our court. He gave his opinion that this is a very effective drug but it carries a risk. As any good doctor should do I guess he didnt try to sway us one way or the other. He gave us the information necessary to make a decision and we made it.Nope no other immunosuppressive drugs up to that point.,MultipleSclerosis,dfud92y,4,t5_2s23e

11466567,0,t3_63o8yi,Hey! Welcome to the club! UnfortunatelyHeat sucks! I live down south in Texas so humidity and  which is murderous. You got it worse no doubt.So I was explained it like this by my neurologist Electrical conductivity in the human body is similar to any conductors. Resistivity of conduction increases as temperature increases. As a result the body has a harder time sending impulses over your already damaged myelin. Slower transmission of signals can exacerbate problems already prevalent through your body. Seems more engineering than medical. But it makes physiological sense.So no hot saunas hot springs hot showers hot deserts or hot anything! Maybe moderation is fineBut really look into avoiding situations that you can and using something like a cooling vest or cold neck towels. It will help a tremendous amount.,MultipleSclerosis,dfvq8w1,2,t5_2s23e

11542430,0,t1_dg4a30t,YAY you are exactly who I was hoping for thanks! I will be seeing Dr Cabot in Concord I think they do infusions there but not sure frankly. Sounds like the Norris Cotton center would work out for me fairly well I currently drive  minutes to my infusion center so intown would be awesome. Does the Norris center do infusions on weekends? Im moving from Southern California to Manchester so learning where everything is is going to be huge.. and learning to drive in the snow haha cry,MultipleSclerosis,dg4c429,1,t5_2s23e
11578880,0,t3_659bbb,Ive been on tysabri for about a year and a half and theres been one time where I had to postpone it I believe  weeks due to a course of antibiotics a few months ago. I didnt have any noticeable effects just the normal sluggishness I get in the days leading up to my next dose so just that experienced a bit longer than usual. ,MultipleSclerosis,dg8h0pn,6,t5_2s23e

11600093,0,t1_dga5vxe,Congrats on your new baby! I just had  in February and am now facing the prospect of starting a DMD for the first time we delayed starting post diagnosis to have another baby. Its freaking me out but it will feel good to be actively doing something about this disease. Im delaying as long as possible to breastfeed I was hoping for  months but I feel like Im getting a little flare so that might not happen. I hope your shots go well and you can enjoy your baby relapse free ,MultipleSclerosis,dgavnxx,1,t5_2s23e
11605172,0,t1_dgbd3b1,I started using an ice pack wrapped in a wet kitchen towel for twenty minutes before injecting when I became usually fearful of that damned autoinjector... Totally worked.  After twenty minutes your muscle is basically frozen as much as your mouth is when they use lidocaine.  Dont use three lidocaine patches or gel though only the actual once packs work and if you dont wrap it in a towel its going to burn and if the towels not damp then it wont freeze.,MultipleSclerosis,dgbgf71,3,t5_2s23e

11739069,0,t3_67i0un,I may be wrong but from what I understand it wouldnt show up on your MRI as its your Optic Nerve thats swollen. Instead an Ophthalmologist should determine if ON is actually the cause. ,MultipleSclerosis,dgqnj9b,2,t5_2s23e
