104641,0,t1_cephyml,I think the best thing is that they didnt ignore it like some untouchable elephant in the room but at the same time its not a central focus.American TV tends to go to either extreme with cringeworthy results.Between the emanicpated slave line and how Jefferson was handled its just really refreshing.,SleepyHollowTV,ceqcf8b,5,t5_2y16q

2745261,0,t3_2rgupl,Please tell me Abby and Crane kept those demon knives.  Hollys bag of tricks is nice but they should have a reliable weapon of some kind.  Guns as it turns out are fairly ineffective against the forces of evil.Im interested in the role Irving will play this season.  I mean hes still a murderer who escaped from a sanitarium.  Pretty sure that means hell get arrested and sent to normal prison but that seems unlikely since the writers couldve just left him dead instead of putting him on a bus.,SleepyHollowTV,cng4hja,3,t5_2y16q

3089352,0,t1_coi2o31,The audience that would have been there for that episode got bored and left before it. So yeah it was Katrinas terrible acting the inexplicable focus on her throughout the season despite not giving her anything meaty to do and sidelining of interesting characters that did it.  Jenny being one of them.A shorter season with a tighter focus on actually fighting the Apocalypse vs. a tugawar over a very boring character would benefit this show if it survives Hurricane Katrina.I do agree this episode was sloppy and full of logic and plothole problems but at least it had the elements that original audience came for.I didnt start watching this show for a love triangle between Ichabod Katrina and Abraham. I came for the Witnesses fighting the Apocalypse.ciranaway is one of a few very tenacious Ichatrina stans who only watch the show for that relationship.,SleepyHollowTV,coi7k6e,2,t5_2y16q

5465070,0,t1_cw9st85,Love the idea of the ring like monster and the toothfairyibizu explanation but something in its execution felt lacking. I wasnt really scared by it at all. I remember just briefly seeing the tree monster in Sanctuary gave me chills. But compared to the rest of this seasons its the best monster so far hopefully they get better.,SleepyHollowTV,cwa7qbs,2,t5_2y16q
7258258,0,t3_4egtlq,I do actually.  I always felt she got an unjust amount of hate simply because she ruined peoples AbbieCrane romance fantasies.  Kinda like the early love interests on Supernatural got hated to death by the femaleslash fanbase.  People put WAYYYYY too much time into fictional romance.Season  took a little bit to get going but as a whole I thought it was an excellent season.  Finale is a bit shocking and practically acts as a series finale if you ignore the last  minutes.  ,SleepyHollowTV,d237no9,1,t5_2y16q
