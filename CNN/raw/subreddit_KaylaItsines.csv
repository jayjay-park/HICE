4743429,0,t1_ctsg4uv,Seriously! Dont bother with it. Go by how your clothes fit and progress pictures! Progress pics are key. I got really bloated when I first started working out again I dont know the science behind it but maybe theres a reason and youre experiencing it too. DDefinitely push through and youll see results. Good luck! ,KaylaItsines,ctsgcp2,4,t5_37pxe
4744454,0,t3_3fvwj3,Hello fellow Amazon! There are a few reasons you can gain weight when you first start a new workout routine.When you first start working out with a new intense routine it causes some inflammation in your muscles which in very few words acts like water retention. There was a great post on rxxfitness I Think a couple months ago which explained it beautifully I just cant seem to find it.  Basically your weight might go up a little or stay the same for the first  weeks then all of a sudden you will pee all the pee like all day long for a few days in a row and you will lose weight. Whats really happened is your body has finally healed from the initial inflammation and is OK with proceeding with the workouts without inflaming everything quite so much so it purges the fluids.Secondly muscle is more dense than fat. With this workout you will gain muscle as you lose fat the more muscle you have btw the more calories you burn just by existing so you need more energy input.Also you are already pretty lean at that heightweight so BF will reduce more slowly.  I would also verify that you are getting enough calories because science tells us that us tall ladies need more calories than the average bear taller means more bone skin muscle etc. mass to move around therefore more energy required. Im  and I can cut with  calories as long as they are the right calories. Two weeks isnt really enough to see anything. I advise following the progress pics thing this seriously helped me and sticking with it. It takes time and hard work to build a hard body!,KaylaItsines,ctsl0ay,3,t5_37pxe

6160757,0,t3_3zwb3j,Hey there. I also finished BBG in November and decided that I wanted to change direction to weight lifting so I started the Starting Strength program. VERY different from Kayla however I find it just as challenging and even though it isnt cardio it still brings my heart rate up,KaylaItsines,cypwxpq,1,t5_37pxe
7442767,0,t3_4h4bbf,Just rest until you feel better. Maybe go for a walkstretchyoga  if youre up to it and then just gradually ease back  into it. You cant make significant gains in a few days nor can you completely ruin your progress in a few days. Feel better !,KaylaItsines,d2o71i6,1,t5_37pxe

9389256,0,t1_d8c1oxh,dont be intimated! when you are doing kayla YOU belong there too! i had a trainer for months who i loved and when he left to go back to school i started kayla and guess what? her workouts were similar to the ones he was giving me they are very professional. so when you are doing them you totally fit in at the gym!,KaylaItsines,d965khv,1,t5_37pxe

9497290,0,t3_5atxee,I would use an calculator to calculate what your TDEE is and go from there.  might be a good range for you it might not. It depends on your goals,KaylaItsines,d9jqrhj,2,t5_37pxe
10303616,0,t1_dcbxxtl,Thanks for the feedback! I wasnt sure what the differences would be ,KaylaItsines,dcbyxri,1,t5_37pxe
10326890,0,t1_dcelfmk,I saw another comment in another thread say to go ahead and repeat and do what is best for you. I know itll get harder so I think I will do week  again but push myself to the limit. Thank you ,KaylaItsines,dcelzm8,5,t5_37pxe

10857221,0,t3_5v4tic,Week  Legs amp Cardio is done!! I really liked that my butt was sore after week  legs on Friday. Is that weird? But I felt like it had been a long time since I felt soreness after leg workouts but week  really kicked it up a notch. ,KaylaItsines,ddzugh3,3,t5_37pxe
10988618,0,t1_dedi436,I do that too! Or Ill do exercises that are in the circuit but not necessarily the first one in the list. Not gonna do  jump ropes again if I can focus on doing another set of push ups! ,KaylaItsines,dediwuq,3,t5_37pxe
