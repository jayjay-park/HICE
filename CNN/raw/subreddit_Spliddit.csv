3213280,0,t3_2wuvyn,Its my second season on a DIY split with the Voile kit and its working well. Id recommend doing the conversion.Follow the instructions that come with the kit maybe watch this guys videos  pt  and  pt   hes pretty thorough about it.Take care when drilling the holes  esp. the ones for the Tnuts you have to drill twice for each one and the throughhole has to align well with the countersink hole  best practice on a piece of scrap wood if you havent done that kind of thing before.,Spliddit,cov22v2,2,t5_2tb1e
3540138,0,t1_cpi3wyp,The one on the left was an expirimental design with sidecut on both sides to allow you to turn more easily while touring.  If you have any questions about getting started feel free to ask.  If you are in the denver area we do a free avy awareness class in the fall that covers a lot of backcountry safety information. ,Spliddit,cpvsqx0,1,t5_2tb1e
3812403,0,t1_cqqg8ge,Yeah not really in the realm of possibilities for me but I have to spend a few weeks riding there before I get too old.,Spliddit,cqquf35,1,t5_2tb1e
5721079,0,t3_3t5hpa,Havent owned a splitboard before but ive done a fair bit og hikingsnowshoeing to get to lines. Also been ski touring. I will be riding in Norway and i am mainly going to do big mountain riding. Steep terrain chutes and so on ,Spliddit,cx698l3,2,t5_2tb1e
6182475,0,t1_cysdjpw,Thanks man I ride a Jones Solution  wide with Karakorum Primes.  Very true about the beacon I was wearing my outer layer earlier but youre absolutely right I should have put my beacon under my midlayer.  ,Spliddit,cysdsue,1,t5_2tb1e

10141550,0,t1_dbta6km,Interesting! You know in both events the board did rack slightly  the right half toe edge sliding backwards which would have twisted the pucks. Since I was initiating onto the toe edge both times perhaps there is an issue with the clips?Seriously though those guys went over the whole thing when it was on their bench and didnt catch anything out of the ordinary. Its not a complicated device I feel like a problem like that would be visible.Thanks for the idea though Im going over the hardware tonight!,Spliddit,dbtg5gx,2,t5_2tb1e

10374140,0,t1_dcjyp1f,Yeah thats a fair point. Id hope I would just kind of treat it like any other piece of emergency gear I carry. Its not an open invitation to do something stupid but if something did happen its nice to have it. Any positive survival percentage increase is worth it.,Spliddit,dcjyz9f,1,t5_2tb1e

10898726,0,t3_5vohcu,Wont be up there at that time I actually just left. There is some very accessible terrain from the Heather Meadows lot. We went up through Swift Creek and rode some mellow lines before heading up to Artist Point and dropped below Table Mountain. Doesnt take more than  mins to an hour to tour up there. I didnt have partner and went to the trailhead on a tuesday and found someone else to tour with in minutes. Have fun and be safe! ,Spliddit,de44k0i,1,t5_2tb1e
10935814,0,t1_de6c51q,gt I think Wil or the Klosters are much more likely to push Splitboarding forwardI didnt even want to keep reading after this  spot on..Maybe Wally Voile Will and the Klosters will figure it out sooner than later.  We are still a decade behind the skiers or so it seems.  And I do love My Sparks!!!  The Karakorams are rad too just a lot of moving pieces,Spliddit,de7yaob,1,t5_2tb1e
