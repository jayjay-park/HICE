8028305,0,t1_d4hh8or,The Redbrands dont show up before you begin your performance but more people are beginning to trickle in as youre walking onto the small platform on the right side of the room. As you begin your first song everyone turns their attention to you. Even the man sitting along opposite from Nosmo. People begin to order drinks and take seats anticipating your performance. Your first set gets everyone excited and they begin to put coins in a small basket at the front of the stage. The next song begins and at this point the room is a little more full and the patrons have to begin to feel the effects from the ale more money is placed in the basket. Your last song begins and you skip a cord. By this point the room is completely filled but most of the locals seem more intent on one another and relaxing after a long day than in your music. You can tell there is a good bit of coin that you made tonight even though the performance ended on a flat note.,Nezton,d4igg8o,1,t5_3emyn
