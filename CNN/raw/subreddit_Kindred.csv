5392544,0,t1_cw0xmrn,IMO Kindred has a similar case to Draven. Theyre both highrisk highreward ADCs and are only guaranteed to make good use of their passives if they win lane. Id say its a good tradeoff if you can play Kindred well.Plus you said its difficult for ADC Kindred to get stacks since your jungler needs the camps but I think you forgot that Wolf only marks the enemy junglers camps. P,Kindred,cw0yhht,1,t5_39yag
5394703,0,t1_cw0ft3c,Hmm I think that wolfs frenzy doesnt have to target anyone just an area and once placed its stationary. That sounds like her ult more. I havent tried targeting an enemy champ with that though so idk. Honestly Ive only ever been able to really play her a little mostly in customs because if she isnt taken shes banned.  I even went to play her in a blind pick game and she was taken for adc my team and top enemy team. Shed actually seem good for adc if my adc didnt keep trying to v after getting fed. Spoiler I dont know how this would spoil anything since you arent going to watch the game but... we lost. Real bummer too cause we should have won. The kindred top wasnt so bad either tbh but had a much harder time against my ganks without a support. rant,Kindred,cw18f0l,1,t5_39yag
5913279,0,t1_cxudzj1,Warrior gives you more damage early on. Meaning you finish your first item and BAM you are a gank machine right there and then. Devourer will give you better stats later. Like  minutes later depending on how teamfights go.Kindred is really really strong early and mid game and Warrior is like punching big steroid needle into lambs ass for a very very cheap price. Usually Kindred  warriors means much much much better gankcapabilties.And you know well ganked lanes are happy lanes and snowbally lanes. If you can keep all your lanes fed  gank for them with kills they gonna outfarm outgrow and later on just stomp their lane opponents. Thats a won game basically.So Devourer  Warrior is not really about the raw stats but the powerspike the items provide. Warrior gives you a big instant powerspike. Devourer will give you better overall performance but much later. If all you lanes are doing well they seem to be having the upper hand you can go devourer if you want and you can spend more time farming and less ganking.But if any of your lanes are behind you might wanna get the Warrior and start ganking like crazy.,Kindred,cxurhos,1,t5_39yag

6539854,0,t3_451z01,idt the new item is viable on her tbh unless you get overfed and snowball hard. due to how the item was made I believe itd be best for AD caster types of assassins rather than her. once they go in and do their spells and autos theyve committed to a situation and they have the burst to support it kin is more of a DPS type rather than burst so the passive would probably go to waste most of the times. of the top of my head duskblade should be great on the likes of rengar khazix zed talon quinn pantheon and if youre feeling particularly adventurous Hecarim,Kindred,czvrvoa,1,t5_39yag

6621754,0,t1_d04699a,You so quickly dismiss the fact that Devourer build does more damage then say Kindred isnt getting as much out of the item as Yi or Xin. What gives? Regardless of how much better the item is on others or how much use they get out of it it does more damage.You seem to describe Kindred as Riven or Renekton a frontline champ relying on jumping around with Q for damage. Q has horrible AD scaling and Kindred is too squishy to be anywhere near the front its simply inviting a Malph ult or the like after youve wasted Q for damage trying to poke. Just stand back by your carry wait for the engage then use the combined DPS of two carries to obliterate everyone who gets too close. AAs W and passive all scale with AS. You can melt face. Your ult can save the other people who can melt face. What I gather is you dont want to melt face and thats cool.This is how I play Kindred at least. I think thats how one would normally play Kindred. Hopefully this illustrates why stating your opinions as fact is silly.,Kindred,d048vva,1,t5_39yag

7799677,0,t3_4m421e,Wits end was sick back when devourer was around. Gave you  magic damage on hit not including passive stacks and hurricane on hit and you could stack wits end up super fast.That said I dont think its quite as good anymore. Still probably ok if and only if you can ensure big v team fights lots of aoe magic damage and preferably some area control for your ult. This allows you to set up a situation where you are able to freely attack the enemy team not get bursted down due to your ultimate and have an aoe Mage like azir come clean up. I mention azir specifically because he does sick damage and shuffles them off of your ult.Thats quite a bit to ask for though. The only other situation in which I get it is to double up on MR along with maw against a magic heavy team or if I want MR  damage and Ive already taken steraks although its possible that maw is still better here even with the shared passive.I think I heard it may be getting buffed soon so Ill see how that goes.

11161556,0,t3_5zd3sg,With lethality getting nerfed and both kindred passive and BOTRK getting buffed causes kindred to be a power pick again in my opinion. Kindred has high hp damage right now compared to most assassins and BOTRK now gives higher burst and higher sustain for kindred. Kindred therefore has higher damage and higher sustain while other similar picks such as Graves. Challenging Bloodrazer hurricane Botrk as a base  items will allow you to get through the early to mid game easily then build situationally like frozen mallet MAW BC and GA. Id  take beserks in most situations but ninja tabis and mercs are definitely options due to such early attack speed so if you need the extra damage block or tenacity dont be shy you wont dramatically need the extra  AS. Overall I think kindred can win most if not all meta jungle match ups and will last long enough damagesustain wise into the game without falling off. Also the addition of the new warlords keystone is mentionable. Ive had a lot of fun testing it out. New initial burst and gaining movement speed to finish the fleeing  hp champs that used to tilt me haha     ,Kindred,dex5ffg,4,t5_39yag

11297701,0,t1_dfccp0e,because is low elo you can carry even with the shittiest champ. I have a  winrate of  games and my friend came from silver  to plat  this season with kindred. You just suck and cant carry gold players. ,Kindred,dfcksrc,5,t5_39yag
11328936,0,t3_61mwtg,As neUp said you generally want to avoid them. However if you run into them a good thing to keep in mind is to stay close to walls you can jump over. When they dash to you jump to safety. If you think you can call them drop W and start attacking over the wall then jump back over to finish them off.,Kindred,dfg46s7,1,t5_39yag

11556483,0,t1_dg5xerd,Also Tarics has a huge delay as well as very telegraphed setup. Kindreds just pops up instantly. Also Taric has no mobility.,Kindred,dg5xjb9,2,t5_39yag
11653561,0,t3_66aqpq,This may be because of my playstyle but I prefer getting bork then bc then rapidfire cannon. By the time its completed teams are well into late game and grouping up. RFC lets me proc an auto every so often from a safe distance and chunk out key targets. I also run Stormraiders and the burst helps proc the MS and lets me catch more people out. Im very open to someone smarter than me about itemization letting me know how that makes me an idiot though. ,Kindred,dggy1wd,1,t5_39yag
11684993,0,t1_dgki69e,Honestly which ever one feels better i guess. If you want to be able to have the mana for abilities go talisman. But if u like lifesteal and having good health then go machete.,Kindred,dgkif2a,1,t5_39yag
