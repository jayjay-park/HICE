885392,0,t1_ch48q81,No music out to share yet. I have mutual connects with Kojoe but have never met him. He isnt super popular within the hiphop scene over here at the moment. Definitely more underground in general. The scene itself is underground and closeknit but I dont think hes really squeezed into the circles that are buzzing at the moment. He also hasnt really been able to have a crazy popular crossover appeal. I think thats what makes what artists like him and I are trying to do difficult. But I think my advantage and what makes me special is that Im a black American artist and Im focusing on U.S. listeners first considering theyre the top hiphop tastemakers and consumers. And so if I get buzz in the U.S. it will naturally carry on over into Japan. And if this happens it is my hope that I will be able to give more creative direction to artists here and help the industry itself in Japan grow. A lot of writing haha I apologize.The industry people I have worked with or spoken to both in the U.S. and Japan are really looking forward to seeing how this goes. They see the crazybeautiful potential here. As you may know there has only been one black American that has tried what Im doing and he wasnt very dope or successful haha. No offense but thats how it is.Thanks for the follow!,hiphopjapan,ch4x7l3,1,t5_2zi7w

1290797,0,t3_28u8qm,Is the community open to nonJapanese? For example Anyone who knows HipHop history knows that Latinos and Hispanics were there from day  however in the Southern Region of the US a Latino DJ or a Latino Bboy is not very welcome in most circles with the majority being Black. It is an exclusion based on a misconception but an exclusion nonetheless. However not all exclusions are meant to be negative. Sometimes people are excluded to preserve a certain form of the art form. So again is the smallknit community open to nonjapanese or is it exclusionary for whatever reason? ,hiphopjapan,cietxk3,1,t5_2zi7w
