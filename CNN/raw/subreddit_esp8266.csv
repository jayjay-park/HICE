One of those would do what you ask but its made to fit in a small container and have connectors whereas you likely want to know what chip they use or adapt the board from one to use in your own circuit. Heres an example but there are many sizes and types out there.Note how the internal shot shows the chip inductor and usb in conn. Instead of using the usb out conn. on pcb bottom youd want to power a circuit. Unfortunately its typical on these devices for them to grind off the ic part code so you cant tell what chip does that.I also have one of these USB charger modules which Ive not yet had a chance to use but I think will work for powering a circuit.

Obviously this makes it an ideal target for malware.The manufacturers are the people responsible for the DDoS going on now. They havent provided the necessary level of support for their gear.On my Raspberry Pi I can update Raspbian with a few keystrokes. These manufacturers need to simplify their firmware system. A single button on an admin page should be all thats necessary to check for an update then run the update.And this is on top of what they should be doing anyway which is ensuring there are security mechanisms in place to prevent abuse.

9492409,0,t3_5ah46a,Not saying its not possible but I think this might be difficult. The reason is because during boot the ESP does some crazy stuff on GPIO. Ive looked with an oscilloscope and during boot GPIO goes haywire for about ms and does not stabilize until after boot. If this is OKwont mess up the MCP then a pullup on GPIO should solve the issue. Try .K on the lines. And CHPD should have a pullup. But the haywire GPIO on boot could cause issues for your component. ,esp8266,d9j550x,1,t5_33oft

Its complex for x desktop CPUs its just less of an issue because The CPUs are faster You often have more than one core to run an interrupt on still one per core Smart programmers use interrupt shims where it handles the interrupt does the minimum possible saving the data to be processed later by a noninterrupt thread.Most of my projects that do much of anything inside the interrupt besides incrementing a counter I disable interrupts as the first thing I do inside the interrupt to make sure I can finish my processing.

10485522,0,t3_5q0a41,People have suggested a lot of great options so far but if you have ever been interested in really understanding how TCPIP works I have another one write a simple TCPIP socket serverclient protocol. Configure one of the ESPs IPs as the master and as each of the others come online have them connect to this host. The master host can then send messages onoff and receive sensor readings. Use plain text to keep things easy. The master would know at all times which clients are connected what their lag is might be important for syncing the LEDs and could collect aggregate statistics from all the sensor readings. The master could still present an HTML interface for the user of course.If this interests you look into the WifiServerWifiClient class in the ESPs Arduino library.,esp8266,dcwn5ok,2,t5_33oft
10493323,0,t1_dcxdumq,I havent written up anything yet  its been on my list but its pretty simple. The schematicImgurThe software at least for basic sending and receiving is pretty simple  just look at the IRremoteESP library. I had to make changes to the library and the code I run is a good bit more complicated because the IR codes are longer than the library can handle I needed a generic fingerprinting of IR codes for my home automation and I needed both instant notification of received IR codes and ways to both send raw and internallygenerated IR codes so theres both a raw socket and JSON interface. Note that circuit design also has a DHT wired in  you dont need that. You just need the IR leds and the IR receiver a resistor and a transistor. Its like  in parts including the ESP.
