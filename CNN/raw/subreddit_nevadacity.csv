9997779,0,t3_4zkco3,Cascade shores is a great location for riding. Just keep following Quaker Hill road up until it turns into dirt jeep going for a while and there is a road on the right. That road goes down to green horn which is a great place to ride. Alternatively instead of turning right you may continue up that road. It turns into power house road which you can follow all the way up to highway ... There are tons of single track trails near the top of power house road.,nevadacity,dbaqmfd,2,t5_2uyao
