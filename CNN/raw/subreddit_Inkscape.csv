970266,0,t3_2562ly,Ive been designing a menu for a formal event and have been looking through svgs of flourishes to put between courses and at the end of the menu. It took me a while but I pinned down something that was nagging at me. Just like your main pic many of the designs are very reminiscent of the female reproductive system! This has limited my choices by about  because I am terrified a diner might say Hey these squiggles look like ladyparts!,Inkscape,chekukd,2,t5_2tgxm
1776464,0,t3_2eknq0,Im able to find a discussion on some extensions here which links to an extension page hereThe coloradjustHLSHSV from there seems at least useable.

2935628,0,t3_2tdy10,Maybe Blender or Gimp would more suitable for the task. With Gimp you can brushes with concrete textures just like photoshop.  You can import the image to inkspace and use trace to vectorize the image.,Inkscape,co1skl2,1,t5_2tgxm

5281138,0,t1_cvmn7hm,I dont know if this works but youre reinforcing my idea that everyone will have to be a computer programmer in  years. I dont think its a bad thing.Q Are the ellipses part of it? Id think Set would have a length attribute.,Inkscape,cvmq6fv,1,t5_2tgxm

11499673,0,t1_dfxhn0i,It has something to do with your fill colors...gradients. And there is a filter effect... if you remove that it shows correctly in firefox but still doesnt save correctly as pdf. All your fill colors are actually gradients for some reason if you change that to solid colors it works.... I have to think about this some more...,Inkscape,dfzhkih,2,t5_2tgxm
