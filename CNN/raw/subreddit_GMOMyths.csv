16404,0,t3_1ub9b0,Comment by paf on BUSINESS General Mills Starts Making Some Cheerios Without GMOs. No law required. in rLibertarianA friend of mine was able to eat jalapeos but is allergic to bell peppers. Some restaurants unknowingly use a genetically modified larger jalapeo that is part bell pepper and she is allergic to that and is now not able to eat jalapeos while eating out as she had allergic reactions. This is definitely a rare edge case but these things are not with out consequences. Personally Im not against GMOs but I think they should require labelling. ,GMOMyths,cegav38,1,t5_2wlze

958754,0,t1_chd8xab,gtWow. Brilliant argumentMy argument is that we should place more trust in those who have spent decades researching and publishing in peer reviewed journals with a clear record of expertise over a man that has none of those things.I see nothing wrong with that argument. gtIve had my fair share of internet arguments and I dont feel like another marathon with someone whos gonna waste my timeI didnt ask for a marathon.

Its the pesticides being used that is the main problem.

The green on the left side seeds is simply a fungicide to prevent the seeds from rotting over winter when theyre put into storage it has nothing to do whatsoever with whether theyre genetically modified or not.

2266469,0,t1_clrszoc,gt Did you know Wakefield is possibly the top GI surgeon in the world? What actually happened is he saw as dangerous MMR vaccines that were recalled and banned in Britain continue to be sold in other parts of the World despite the fact that they caused dangerously high numbers of encephalitic fevers in children. He attempted to market a much safer single dose measles vaccine and was absolutely smeared by the pharmaceutical industry.No he was paid by a group of solicitors to produce a study that would allow said group of solicitors to sue vaccine makers if he could link MMR to autism.Not a single one of his results have been replicated by numerous studies.And Ill read your Malcolm X quote as the newspapers being whatever stupid woowoo website you got your nonsense from.
