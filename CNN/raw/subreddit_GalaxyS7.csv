6721243,0,t3_47l9oq,I used to work phone sales at Sams Club a few years ago. You are literally on a physical list at the store that will be fulfilled as devices arrive. There is no guarantee that you will have one on launch day. For example if  arrive then they call the first  people on the list. There is not a specific device somewhere with your name on it. Also this is literally in the hands of the employee working the counter. So if they want they could realistically let their friend cut in front of you if they wanted to. Not saying that will happen but it is possible.Edit This of course was my experience from the specific store I worked for. That does not guarantee that the same thing is happening at your store. ,GalaxyS7,d0ej93o,3,t5_2wi0z

6769904,0,t3_48hr8l,Usually there are summer sales through carriers. If the S doesnt do well which I doubt will be the case because its so far been dubbed superior over the last  iterations then they would slash prices to increase sales.

6775283,0,t1_d0c2aq4,Yea unfortunately no longer  They previously included one of the dry install plastic protectors and they worked pretty well. I noticed there was no longer any mention of the screen protectors on the website so I emailed them.I sent the email on Sunday and they responded Tuesday afternoon...Thank you for contacting us. Unfortunately since the release of the Note  we no longer include screen protectors with our devices. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding...EDIT I should also mention IMO theyre still a fantastic value for the quality of the cases let alone the awesome design. Ill still get one for every device so long as they dont change their qualitydesign too much. I should also mention one thing that kind of bothers me is they dont yet make any solidcolored cases for the S Edge although they do make a couple for the regular S. Oh well the Ash case looks fantastic with the Silver Titanium S so its not the end of the world. That said I can definitely see the glossy see through cases scratching very easily. Ive always bought the boring solid black case and the things never age. I might just order a new one if they start making new colors.,GalaxyS7,d0k9fke,1,t5_2wi0z

7150932,0,t3_4dhdwx,I thought it had something to do with when sending from one iMessage user to another iMessage user the images and other multimedia are sent through data much like Google Hangouts otherwise the image is sent through MMS which can have a size restriction based on your carrier. If the image hits that size restriction youll get that downloading when you cant actually download it. This is also why most text messaging apps significantly downgrade images you send.Everything I said above might be completely wrong though so take it with a grain of salt.,GalaxyS7,d1qzm60,1,t5_2wi0z

7415734,0,t1_d2l3w8s,Yes I use a Spigen Rugged Armor case and an iqshield HD clear screen protector. You can get both together for less than  from Amazon. The case even though it says rugged is quite slim and gives you basic protection however it feels amazing in hand with its smooth matte finish and carbon fiber accents. As for protectors Ive always purchased tempered glass protectors however with the edges curved glass all the options currently seemed substandard so I was forced to go with film. I first got the armorsuit militaryshield but it was too rubbery and impeded swipes and touches. I just applied the iqshield HD clear screen protector and wow what a difference! It feels very close to glassbare screen and Im very happy with it. And I have the edge version. I had the international f version on tmobile but for some reason I didnt get the reception I have come to expect from it. So I ended up selling it and just got a tmobile branded s edge and its working amazingly. The battery life on the edge is totally worth getting the slightly bigger phone.

Before that there were many reddit applications available for you to use if you didnt want to use the mobile reddit site.When the official Reddit app launched it gave you  free months of gold so lots of people downloaded it just for that but the app is lacking some features and functions that other thirdparty apps provide so at least judging by comments on rAndroid a lot of people dont currently use it. It has received a few updates since launch and even at launch I personally found it rather smooth and simple to use but it did lack a few features. I havent tried it out much since then.There are a lot of reddit apps available in the Play store Reddit is Fun is just one of them though I personally use it on my phone and tablet and wouldnt want anything else.

Maybe i would just need to get used to it. I wasnt used to  before i had the s and I got used to it.

Android Pay alone certainly wasnt going to do it and ISIS probably didnt do any favors.Id love to use Samsung Pay for terminals that dont have taptopay so that I can show the vendor that people use that method. If they see it enough they might update their terminal. Most businesses Im at are just now making the switch over to chipandsigpin terminals so theyve also gained a taptopay option. Nothing against Samsung in fact a few years ago I definitely said Id never get a Touchwiz device. Samsung is truly making the best Android phones on the market these days.Id imagine Im still going to carry around cards in my wallet for justincase situations. I just dont like to carry cash.

9083347,0,t3_54ndzc,Try searching this subreddit for other threads about battery.  There is an easy solution to your problem but Im not going to tell you.Search around for it as its not hard to find my dude.Although the best solution isnt that far spread for whatever reason so I will tell you this.  The easiest way to fix this issue is to download EZ Disabler.  Its the only package disabler that will show you running processes on your phone.For whatever reasons the battery draining processes dont show up under developer options on the S.And just because it says Android OSSystem doesnt mean its a system app... its an app you installed.Lots of apps can drain your battery.  For me it was google chrome running in the background on its own.  Now you can guess and just kill background processes for certain apps but that is a pain.With EZ disabler you simply open it and select the RUNNING PROCESSES option and then scroll to the bottom.  At the top its running system apps and preinstalled apps and you dont need to worry about those right now.So scroll to the bottom and you will see usually  apps that you have installed that are currently running andor running in the background.One of my examples was Chrome.  It showed me that Chrome was running....and I was like wtf its not showing up under Dev Options.  So what you do is you disable Chrome...then wait a few seconds and reenable it.  Battery drain solved.Sometimes whether it was from an update or god knows what I will open EZ Disabler and  games will be just running in the background.  So I disable all of them and then reenable.EZ Disabler is a life saver when it comes to battery issues.Also turn off Google Location Wifi signal search and bluetooth...you can use EZ Disabler first and if that doesnt work then disable the above  features if you want.For me though the battery drain is apps running in the background and I imagine for almost everyone that is the cause.Rarely the offending app will start right back up after you reenable it....in this case you can just leave it disabled.  Most people hate their phone losing battery life when its in standby or they are sleeping....so you can just disable the offending app s while you sleep.That being said its pretty rare that an app starts back up after you disable it but it does happen.  Still an easy fix though.I also love how a comment said DERRRRRRRRR THIS IS WHY I STICK WITH IOS.Ya you keep doing that where you have no freedom to tinker with anything....sounds like fun.  Their shit always works because its their way or the highway and I like things my way.,GalaxyS7,d83o5fc,0,t5_2wi0z

Then take a screen shot of your battery stats and brag about it. Youll get up votes if you claim its because you have an exynos and down votes if you claim you have a snapdragon.

9638992,0,t3_5d1ty1,While the phone on the outside is water resistant on the inside it is not. Therefore while I am sure you can take it for a dive in a pool or not be afraid if it gets dropped into a puddle or a lake I am really afraid to take it in the shower. You know the phone has stickers on the inside that react to water and therefore they can indicate if your phone has been damaged by water on the inside or not. You can see one if you take out the sim tray. If it is not white it means it came in contact with water and your warranty will void. While water can not get that easy on the inside STEAM can because it is vaporized water and therefore it can break through the sealing of the speaker grill and through the Sim tray. To conclude steam can damage your phone even if the phone is keeps working because the water condenses. I would therefore not take a steamy shower or keep it away from it because that water wont be able to come out afterwards. ,GalaxyS7,da17d4z,0,t5_2wi0z

9921181,0,t3_5hfgtk,Get an app called GPS status. Itll automatically download agps data daily and is just a really good app to have. Besides that I do remember back in the days when I did use a package disabler I had a similar problem I first noticed whenever I played pokemon go. It would for some reason place me back home and just not respond to where I was going at all. Another glitch it caused was that the GPS status app I mentioned above  would refuse to load. Or it would suddenly load like  minutes later. Try loading that app and see if it works at all. You might be having the same problem.      If its the same glitch unfortunately its too late and uninstalling the package disabler wont work because the glitch has already become system deep. I can help ya fix it painlessly though. P. S.  While youre already doing stuff with the package disabler before you reenable it you should try tapping on each of the items you had disabled to see if any are actually using more than .  ram. You should only disable things that are actually doing something. Disabling stuff that isnt impacting your system at all wont give you any gains but will more likely lead to more glitches and crashes. The S should literally never crash.  If it does then something is wrong.    ,GalaxyS7,db0r6m6,2,t5_2wi0z

10099236,0,t1_dbne52q,They didnt really butcher the stock audio stream code for no reason. They actually made it a lot better. The audio engine on the S is a lot more powerful than on stock Android. Thats why you could have a volume normalization feature in the stock Samsung app and why there are so many higher quality audio production apps in the galaxy app store versus the toyish ones you get from the play store. Just so you know it wasnt for no good reason. They out thumbjam from the galaxy apps store. Stock Android isnt capable of anything near that level of live audio processing.

10215150,0,t1_dc1nyoi,The way it works is that things that you use infrequently go into power saving mode where they will be automaticslly set to Greenify. Whereas apps you use all the time wont be. If an app is set to save power itll still be available to use but itll more likely be shut down if left in the background. It works a bit too well at times and has convinced a lot of people that the phone has memory management problems. I posted about this a week ago when I connected the dots. If you are always seeing a certain app close by itself you should go through both power saving features and disable both for the app. Thatll prevent it from shutting down in the future when left in the background.

Of course thats if you have no notifications no message app running in the background to get messages while you sleep etc etc.  There should be a built in option that makes sure the phone doesnt do anything while it sleeps.  Maybe Ill bug Neo about setting up force doze or something.I used to get only  percent drain consistently but now for some reason Android System and Android OS do something and Im losing a few extra percent battery.Its not a huge deal but its fucking annoying.Its just so crazy that there isnt an easier way to track down battery drain issues.  ,GalaxyS7,ddx1rtq,1,t5_2wi0z

10935387,1,t3_5w5rku,The only reason youd complain about the update speed is because you have no idea how much more youre getting and take it for granted. TouchWizgrace UX android is years ahead of stock. Of course itll take time. The S is the most feature packed phone on the planet and the version of nougat we get is years ahead of the version other devices get. Look at how long weve had split screen? Look at the app optimizer that the S introduced that works so well Google copied it and added it to the pixel and didnt even do a good job. Compare your noise cancelation you have versus stock android. Your phone can handle an do pages and pages more  than stock can. And its just as fast and smooth now with even better battery life than the pixel. How would this not take a bit more time? Im surprised it doesnt take even longer. ,GalaxyS7,de7wpjm,-3,t5_2wi0z

I immediately got a case for it but realizing how the shock protection worked I opted for the thinnest case I can fine as long as it prevented the glass from smacking directly into the ground. No matter how durable the device is glass is glass but having learned that it uses its thick metal chassis as a shock dampener Im completely confident in a case as thick as construction paper. Thats a picture of it. Ive dropped it more times than I can count and I even had it catapulted across the room before it smacked against the wall and landed on the tile floor and it was completely fine.

11320719,0,t3_61jvhd,have you done any basic trouble shooting?Check whats running in developer optionsrunning services and then uninstalldisable it all at once or one by one to see if it helps.You said you did a factory reset which didnt help...its important to note if the drain started without installing any rd party apps?Or did you factory reset then install all your apps then the drain was back?Usually the drain can be figured out by factory resetting and then seeing if it comes back...if it doesnt come back then you know its a third party app and can install apps in threesfives until the drain comes back.If you still have drain after a factory reset then you can use a package disabler to disable stock apps to see which one is draining your battery.  You can disable lots of stuff with a package disabler...theres only a few apps you need running for your phone to actually run...so you can disable quite a bit to try and figure out where the drain is coming from.Before using a package disabler though go through the application manager and uninstall all bloat and disable what you can.Remember this is temporary till you find the culprit then you can reinstall everything like normal.You can put your phone into airplane mode to see if that stops the drain..if it does you know its an app with access to the internet.Make sure to turn off wifi scanningnearby device scanning no one needs this on.  Id turn off bluetooth until you need it...no reason to always keep it toggled.So what I would do if I were you is factory reset.  Wait to see if the drain comes back DO NOT install any apps. If the drain isnt there you know its a rd party app right?  Then only install apps in bunches and then wait.  Install only the apps you really need to start with.IF the drain is still there go to application manager and disableuninstall what you can and see if that stops the drain.  Then go to developer optionsrunning services and see whats running on your phone.   times out of  something you see in running services is the app draining your battery.If this doesnt work you need to use a package disabler to disable what you cant disableuninstall.  You can uninstall the package disabler if you think its evil after you find the drain.Anywho for right now you can go to developer optionsrunning services and look at whats there....most likely one of those services and its associated app are draining your battery.  Also check cached processes in the top right same thing applies.Apps to note are google app facebook messenger google play music google play movies hangouts whatsapp maps drive gmail google back up instagram snapchat these are common apps that drain battery while you use them AND running in the background when you arent using them.Background running apps will drain your battery when you are using your phone and when you are not.If you have any further questions let me know...but this is a sure fire way to figure out what is draining your battery.If you still cant figure it out you are going to have to do a wake lock detector test with GSAM battery monitor.  It requires you plugging your phone into the computer via USB and running ADB commands.  Ive never had to do it myself but there are tons of guides on how to do it.There are some other little tips here and there but this should be enough to get you started....Make sure in Nougat to power save everything you can in the battery settings.  EVERYTHINGGGGGGGGGGGGGG.  Also in the battery settings if you see high android system usage thats almost always a background running app.  If you see high Android OS drain thats usually an app using the internet or an app using a sensorpart of the operating system.Also check what apps are using the most data in the settings as that could be the drain.  But just because you see high android systemos drain doesnt mean its the system it could just be an app USING a part of android system.,GalaxyS7,dff6nh5,4,t5_2wi0z

11524200,0,t1_dg297po,Thats how it works. And you know now you know its true? Because we tested it to provided data to back it up and we all have devices that work flawlessly and have amazing battery life. You wont even provide a snapshot of your battery life and claim that battery measurements arent even reliable. So what are you relying on? A crystal ball? All the people who upvoted there alone are those who have confirmed it to be true by their own repeated experimental observations using the best data we have available STATS which you dont even believe in. And also Ill remind you that all this flies in the face of xda itself which are seen as authorities on roms yet we proved them wrong on this subject by appealing to actual evidence and data. Why do you think so many people go around warning others AGAINST package disablers and Greenify when even though it runs against prevailing misconceptions? You asked me before if a cached process was any app thats running in the background. No its not. This is what it is hereIm gonna cut and paste an explanation of how why package disablers dont work hereGutting is only in reference to system processes. You can disable all the apps you want. No one sees an issue with that I dont think. Its just that if you look at a package disabler they flag mostly system processes and literally anything they can get away with that wouldnt immediately brick your device. This is a marketing method since then they can report a high number of bloat items and if you were to see that number youd be so freaked out youd think youre an idiot for not buying their product. I fell for the same thing originally and went through the exact same thought process everyone did. I disabled a bunch of crappy touchwiz bloat and the system still slowed down and got all glitchy and my battery life is shit stock android is the only Android that should exist! But then we all began to realize that the less we disabled the better things got on their own until we just tried doing without Greenify and package disablers completely. With further investigation we found out why things were backfiring. Modern touchwiz isnt like old touchwiz. Its completely modular and uses a usage tracker to automatically shut down whatever you dont need. The web work of processes that is touchwiz is designed to be self managing where every process is a node that signals to other processes if there is work to be done. If there isnt then they all shut down. When you remove a node other nodes start receiving busy signals which causes nodes that would otherwise just pass the data along to get stuck which leads to a chain reaction. This doesnt happen right away but happens over time and so the connection to package disablers wasnt as clearly obvious. If you dont actually use any of the processes they never even use any resources at all. But disabling them will cause everything else to use more resources and glitch out trying to find them. Thats why you get that really long lag where its so bad that things wont even load until minutes later. People encounter that and think its touchwiz but its not at all. I never get anything close to a lag. As far as Greenify theres also a usage tracker that automatically puts processes that are resource intensive or infrequently used into standby. Greenify throws all the numbers off so your system will have no choice but to behave completely randomly. It wont know what apps to prioritise and which to put into standby. Without Greenify apps you frequently use open instantly where as apps you infrequently use are kept in standby so they dont use up any background resources and so can take a bit longer to load. With Greenify everything is randomly laggy.  End of quote. And fuck off with talking to coders. Were not talking about disabling apps. Were talking about system processes. We all know how system processes work and they are obviously interdependent. How do you think the quick toggle knows whether or not to be on or off? You think it just refers to itself? You dont think it relies on other processes? Stop lying to people dude. Youve been accused of mouthing off when you didnt know what the hell you were talking about and I came to your defense because you do try to help people and thats valuable in itself but I have to draw the line if youre actually spreading disinformation              P. S. I like how youre like we both dont know anything meanwhile Im working highly rated guides on the very subject that again are subject to scrutiny and are never inaccurate.   Where is your demonstration of your knowledge on the subject matter?   Quit being a prick. Just because you dont know how something works doesnt mean its a mystery of the ages.  Apply some common sense Hulivar obviously system processes are not used directly. So how are they used if not by being polled by another processapp?   ,GalaxyS7,dg29qbq,1,t5_2wi0z

11569242,0,t3_653mrf,No need to erase the cache. Cache is good. It reduces your network data use and speeds up apps web browsing. If you erase the cache the phone will need to download the static images for your favorite website over and over. Cache is maintained automatically if the phone runs out of space it will automatically erase some of the cache. The erase function is only useful if a rarely used app builds up a big cache but eventually it will also be overwritten automatically. Empty memory is wasted memory. You should stay away from RAM cleaners and task killers. Both are more harmful than not using them at all.,GalaxyS7,dg7dnrr,6,t5_2wi0z

11583401,0,t1_dg8xhjp,Im sure I read somewhere about not using Kies as its an old platform and not really suited to the newer firmware file structure. although you do need the usb drivers from kies.  Kies is official Samsung software whereas Jodin is rd party and although they essentially do the same job there may be a conflict there.  Another thing to remember is that Kies will only install firmware based on your location ie Samsung will have to release the firmware for your specific country and carrier first. This means that you will not be able to install an update that was released in the UK if it wasnt released in the US yet if that makes sense!  Im not sure if Kies reads the serial number of the phone but if youve managed to write the new csc file to the device it may be detecting a wrong csc therefore not playing ball.Some things you could try if you havet already done so...Try a different USB cable or port.  Dont use a USB hub.Are you disconnecting the phone before putting it back into download mode then reconnecting?  Some people report having to factory reset the phone at least once others several times before Odin detects the phone again in download mode. ,GalaxyS7,dg8zhh2,1,t5_2wi0z
