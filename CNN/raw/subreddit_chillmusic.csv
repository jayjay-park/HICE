336115,0,t1_cfflblk,Strange the youtube tells me that it is not blocked in any country. I might know what is the problem you are encountering because Youtube could not encode webM vp video for now at least properly. So If you do not have flash installed on your pc  You might have No Sound in your video.Have you tried changing the video quality to P or P because that will force youtube to use AVC instead of Vp If you can not view this video you might give downloading a shot However youtube tells me that it is not blocked  When I was Making This Video I got lazy and got my self AVS Audio Converter because I had a small problem with my opensource alternative it was easy to fix but It would require time So I encoded the audio with AVS I was not satisfied but I still uploaded it on youtube Then I noticed that audio was strangely encoded and It took youtube two days to process this video Then I decided to uploaded a version that would be created with opensource tools but It still being encoded by youtube . I hope that version will work on youtube better then this ,chillmusic,cfflwz5,1,t5_2rnvn

7320222,0,t1_d29wy18,Portuguese lyrics are herebut its rather difficult to translate... Firstly because of the somewhat poetic style in which it is written which would be lost and secondly because to avoid literal translation one would have to force ones own interpretation.In any case the gist of it is an introspection on dealing with pain and disillusion within the duality between feelings of love and passion of wanting to stay and being to leave.This is however a rough superficial and subjective take on the lyrics P,chillmusic,d2a9bt5,2,t5_2rnvn
