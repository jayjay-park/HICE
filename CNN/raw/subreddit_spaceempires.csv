4710668,0,t1_ctmbmb6,Yes balance mod.Easily a minute for the computer to process turns maybe more. Ship and colony lists etc. take several seconds to open. Ship movement and combat are reasonably fast though.,spaceempires,ctobgpn,1,t5_2semc

8983748,0,t1_d7qp1dz,I didnt do much modding in SEIV. I bought it when it came out and havent played it but once or twice since SEV came out. Most of what I did was download custom ship and race assets and modify some tech levels and requirements. I was unaware of the reference. I now understand the post. Changing my downvote to an upvote unfortunately didnt bring you above  for the post.,spaceempires,d7rpir4,2,t5_2semc
