936809,0,t1_charj3o,That is the nature of Clan that has donationweek rules there will always be some kicking at the end of the week.Its just a matter of bestfit really there are Clans out there Reddit or not with much more lenient donationweek e.g.  per season or no donation req at all and on the other end of the spectrum there are Clans with much higher donation req e.g.  or  per week its just a matter of where do you feel is best for you according to your online time playing activity etc.I hope you dont take it personally its a rule that we DO NOT try to hide and you did not meet it as simple as that I would do the same even if the Elders are not meeting the donation requirement.,RedditOzone,charqss,1,t5_31ba1

2363916,0,t1_cm31zwe,The reality is that a move to a different system will cause some people to leave the clan. Staying with the current system may be fine but I feel that it may limit our performance going forward. ,RedditOzone,cm3w1pw,1,t5_31ba1
