One tactic you might consider is to look for the User Manual and review the section that discusses how to upgrade RAM or replace the Hard Disk.  If the Wireless Adapter is exposed when you remove the panel to get at RAM or HDD then you should be able to replace the Wireless Radio component with whatever you want.

5810785,0,t1_cxh9kzb,Shaping RF to push or restrict highly attenuated RF to inside of a building is already doable with low cost today we do it every day. If LifI works well in reflective conditions then it will be easy to pick up through a window. UV films and IR films on windows are alternatives yes but those films are pretty costly and just raise the price of LiFi to work in high security offices. If you trust the encryption though then I think we agree it doesnt matter LifI and WiFi should be able to support GCM or WPA TLS or PEAP just fine since they are using the same modulation. Repeaters for LifI will have the same limitations of WiFi halfduplex multihop costs and as most papers and proposals read will require x or more light TxRx units than WiFi which means unless each node is wired in that multigigabit throughput drops REALLY fast and more importantly the latency doubles each hop. LiFi units have a range of up to m for up to MAXIMUM Gbps per client which means you need to be sitting under a light and using very wide channels practical use cases show more like Mbps. In most houses that means EVERY light has to be a data node. Maximum range of m with much lower capacities thereafter.  To the point of the OPs post I think its a huge stretch to say alternative to WiFi which is what I am speaking to. If we want to say it can supplement WiFi in specific use cases and applications fantastic device to device industrial medical uses etc. But I think the challenges from a consumer level to make it a affordable b flexible c ubiquitous and d hard to interfere with and make it easy to use are insurmountable and make it a dead technology when the pitch is We can replace WiFi and were faster too! Will LiFi work with my phone in my pocket? Laptop in bed and maintain connection as I walk from bedroom to bathroom to kitchen to living room? Not in most cases. So at least we agree it will not replace WiFi or serve as a viable alternative nor will it even come close. Now setup some super wide channelmultichannel spectrum bridges for PtP across open space in environmentally controlled areas for data link I think you got a sweet technology.
