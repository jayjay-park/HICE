4134401,0,t3_380wyk,When you say Tomboy what exactly do you mean? Like I understand what a Tomboy is but there are differences between the spectrum.  For instanceMako from Da Capo could be described as a Tomboy in that she has short hair is generally loud and somewhat violent and fronts a tough exterior as opposed a dainty one.  Same goes for Amakase in Da Capo .In MajiKoi Wanko would probably be the most Tomboyish character Maybe also Asa from Shuffle? Ageha from KonoSora might be classified as one as shes not as dainty as the other girls in the vn.But honestly it looks like youve read a vast majority of these VNs so yeah...  Looks like Amakase from DaCapo would be the only one from a VM you havent read?  But shes more.. tough than she is Tomboy. ,vnsuggest,crrjk8k,1,t5_38fka

4653625,0,t1_cth577f,The first had the best mechanics but I started with the second. The writing felt like it got better with later entries so I judge the first a little harshly.,vnsuggest,cth5dti,1,t5_38fka
4941917,0,t3_3hw0g2,Higurashi and Umineko both have some pretty twisted moments. Higurashi is much more focused on the horror than Umineko but they are both really fantastic VNs that I cannot recommend enough.Higanbana is another work by the same author that is really dark and messed up but its not a mystery. Its pretty short not much longer than Saya no Uta. All three of these VNs come in two parts. Umineko has a fantastic graphicsvoice patch called the Umitweak patch. Higurashi has a graphics patch and the steam version has both a graphics patch and a voice patch but it only has the first episode out of  available right now. ,vnsuggest,cuhguuo,1,t5_38fka
5149633,0,t1_cv6pupn,Ill look into these. A quick question though is it recommended that I download from the external links on vndb or is there somewhere else you recommend i check out?,vnsuggest,cv6q3eu,1,t5_38fka
6132376,0,t3_3z36lv,Im going to just consolidate what you wrote in the OP because its kind of long and hard to grasp all at once.  You want an Englishtranslated VN not moege Hscenes optional with voice acting. Medium length or longer but pacing is important.  The VN should have a strong story with Romance and at least  different heroines with routes. No animations or minigames. The VN should be very realistic no fantasy or scifi but Key magic is probably okay.Softer preferences   Modernpolished graphics Preferably at least one route is very dark not necessarily in a bad end way. Protagonist should be strong proactive reserved with people but not an asshole and have a lot of inner monologue. At least one heroine with nonblack hair Tsundere heroine For the most part single pointofview is preferred. Definitely no making choices for characters other than the protagonist.  Ill refer to the list later to try and make actual suggestions... but hopefully this will make it easier for the others to think of something.  Maybe you can consider Princess Evangile though.,vnsuggest,cymoqq5,1,t5_38fka
6186493,0,t3_409i1j,So your friend has only played Cinders?For an otome VN Id recommend Amnesia If she has access to a Vita then Code Realize as well though I personally found the former to be better. Amnesia is more based on the characters and their development while Code Realize focuses more on the plot. These two are both relatively long and are both around  hours in total. They were both made by the same developers. Theres also Norn but I havent played that. Supposedly its a little weak though. Amnesia is the most wellknown out of these.Hakuoki is a pretty popular game and was released on various systems. Its also around  hours long I think and mostly plotbased. Its okay.If shed like to play something shorter I can recommend The Second Reproduction Its not as good as the other too but still a fun and enjoyable game. Around  hours long.Hatoful Boyfriend is a really fun parody of otome games and its become pretty popular. Less than  hours long.For BL the only good one Ive played to completion is No Thank You Its not very long  hours but its kind of strangely paced and feels a lot longer than it actually is. Pretty good though. Theres also Hadaka Shitsuji Which is pretty wellknown in the BL community to say the least. Lots of extreme content and very dark humor. If thats your thing great. If not then maybe still check it out for a bit for the sake of the panel.Since shes planning to hold a panel I recommend she check out some of the following otomeBL games too. These are all relatively big and popular names in the translated otomeBL VN community. I didnt name them above because I think theyre bad but if she wants to do a panel itd be good to be know about them and check them out for a bit. DRAMAtical Murder and the other translated games by the same company NitroChiral. Dramatical Murder is the most wellknown and very popular also the only one Ive played. Starry Sky is simply boring as hell,vnsuggest,cysu8ir,4,t5_38fka

9140124,0,t1_d82c565,Many thanks for such a thorough reply! Played everything youve listed and liked every VN mentioned except PsychoPass and . I pretty much liked st season of PsychoPass but didnt know there was a VN. Ill be sure to take a look at it.And I was hearing very good things about  and the entire series. Too bad I dont have either iPad or Nintendo. Maybe there could be some tricks e.g. via emulator?,vnsuggest,d8akrwz,1,t5_38fka
9294319,0,t1_d8tnk52,thx!deardrops was already on my whishlist.is kindred spirits on the roof really is about a sweet love story? i mean from what it sounds like on the VNDB description it sounds kinda dark.thx anyway though!p.s. i was thinking about getting kira kira. is it any good?,vnsuggest,d8u4dny,1,t5_38fka
10222399,0,t1_dbx9pue,Just finished it.  would recommend! When you finally get the true ending which is pretty hard to get as you have to make some specific choices and everything finally falls together youll be sure to have an unforgettable experience. But this is the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo!PS. You can get it on Steam,vnsuggest,dc2rl0g,1,t5_38fka
11335170,0,t1_dffg1ch,Cant speak for OP but Uchikoshi is good at creating tangled cats cradles of plots that get mostly resolved all at the end.  The questions pile up and up and up and then it all magically comes together for the most part.  The flip side of this is that this affects the pacing of the rest of the story and his stories dont always have the best pacing.I havent played the rerelease yet but if you have a DS Id recommend the DS version of .  It has bar none the most brilliant use of the dual screen system I have ever seen.I rather enjoyed the game but I can see how it wouldnt be someones cup of tea.,vnsuggest,dfgtlca,1,t5_38fka
