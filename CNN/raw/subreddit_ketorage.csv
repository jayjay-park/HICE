2251722,0,t3_2ky81m,After a year of keto Ive noticed that for me a few meals like that dont really matter. If I eat too much of it bloating farting and so on. But in the long run these cheat days are irrelevant.I even tried a Full Diet Break but apart from minor changes and a bit of extra water weight nothing special. Nothing. And I dont think Im special. A lot of people could get away with a few days of a more loose diet like now and on holidays there is no need to put extra stress on yourself. It works for me and the holidays with the family are very nice. I can enjoy anything I want because I am in controll.,ketorage,clq19aw,1,t5_2sk7n
