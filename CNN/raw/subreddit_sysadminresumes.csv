2494104,0,t3_2o3erq,I would edit out your personal information unless you are fine with it being publicly posted.In your first paragraph you used leaning instead of learning. I am conflicted with the Career Highlights section personally. Ive actually never seen that on a resume and it seems... redundant? I am not so sure. The resume is already a bit long so it might be something that you can strip. I personally would omit your education unless you actually graduated. I know for a lot of people an incomplete degree can seem worse than no degree at all. I dont think many people will see it as a plus even if it is technically some education. This may just be a personal quirk though. With all your experience I dont it would reflect badly upon you to omit it.Other than that my only real issue is the length. I am a huge fan of onepage formats. I think the Technical Skills could be formatted in a different way such as removing old technologies Windows   etc. Hope this helps. EDIT Oh and stop using Yahoo as your email service!  ,sysadminresumes,cmk48l2,1,t5_2u6u4
3786465,0,t1_cqlnfnb,No offense but your resume is a little weak Id honestly pinpoint that as the reason youre not getting more bites.  Dont be afraid of expanding to another page. Under your current section you gave me a basic idea of what youre working with but its really basic from that summary you look like an entry level sysadmin. I really want to know what youre doing with that technology tell me the projects give me some details. Anyone can put design and deploy Exchange but give me a little more on what that involved how many users servers etc. This shows me you know what youre talking about.   You mentioned that youve been using a little powershell but I dont see that listed in your current position. You really need to beef that section up and let it reflect what youre doing.,sysadminresumes,cqnvxrp,1,t5_2u6u4
5889224,0,t3_3vxub5,Overall effect  Looks like your skills and experience are pushing you more towards IT management than sysadmin.  When you do your DICE Monster Careerbuilder Stackoverflow profiles which you should be doing now consider creating  resumes.  One for straight sysadmin which should have examples of which skills you used in each position and generally be a bit more techoriented.  The other would be for applying to an IT Manager role.  For this one add a little more focus to your management experience number of people performance management budgeting maintenance contracts vendor relations.Your current resume is well constructed but is part IT manager and part sysadmin so will suffer in comparison to resumes that are sysadminonly or it manager only.  Finally start engaging with the headhunters.  Id recommend sticking to larger more established shops as there are a lot of random agents out there with nothing more than an email client and a lot of hope. ,sysadminresumes,cxrm0nv,3,t5_2u6u4
7153691,0,t1_d1qxuh9,Wow thanks a lot! I genuinely appreciate this very much and will rewrite it with your thoughts in mind.I would love to point to projects that Ive collaborated on but really dont have much to show. Ive just been reading documentation and working through Red Hat objectives on virtual machines. But like the website I built I could be writing stuff like Create cron jobs to automate maintenance tasks such as encrypted backups to my homelab via ssh. That sounds way better than built via command line Ill definitely axe the Other Skills and Summary but I may include that stuff in a cover letter. My associate degrees are from community college are they worth leaving towards the top? Should I separate them from my certifications and move them to the bottom? ,sysadminresumes,d1raxws,1,t5_2u6u4
9713495,0,t1_daa2unh,I appreciate the help. Im going to move forward with your advice.Last question though with the resume itself did you notice anything that should be changed for someone looking for a Desktop Technician title?,sysadminresumes,daaecpc,1,t5_2u6u4
