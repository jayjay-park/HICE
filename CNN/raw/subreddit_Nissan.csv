282761,0,t1_cf90nop,Generally the enthusiast community itself hates the CVT with passion more so than regular automatics. Because of its design there is no linear feel of power coming from the engine going to what normally would be into a geared transmission. Instead that power fluctuates on a CVT hence Continuously Variable in CVT depending on how hard you mash your right foot into the accelerator pedal.The design and idea of the CVT comes down to comfort automatically managing torque and power from the engine under certain situations and fuel economy. There are definitely pros of the CVT itself but of course there are the cons. As mentioned by Skitzo theyre not as sharp and responsive they drone the engines making the whole experience noisy and just downright boring.However because of how Nissan have been very anal by sticking with the CVT since they introduced it into their cars in the s it seems that theyre been very successful in doing so. However that doesnt come with the amount of problems that the CVT inherently has in terms of its own design.The CVT can be a diva to maintain in comparison to its geared counterparts. Since it can be a diva it can also fail because of its design or how it was built in the factory. Ive read cases for the  Altima . S had transmissions replaced. So far I havent had any issues but Im seriously knocking on wood.Even the  model year Altima had issues with the CVT itself where it would fail months after buying from the dealership.I admire Nissans intentions to go green with fuel efficient cars and the like. But sticking a CVT to about  of their lineup with most of those without a manual transmission option as well as sticking them to performance oriented vehicles  Maxima  Altima . SR sedan is just a farce.,Nissan,cfa2lsh,3,t5_2qwwh
282811,0,t1_cf7vvts,gtThat CVT probably took tens of millions to develop and the manufacturing would likely make it unfeasible for anything short of a million dollar supercar.So did developing it for the consumer market.However because it was quickly banned in F that threw the whole RampD back in time by  years because transmission manufacturers like Jatco would have loved to see how it all played out in the racing world.Just now Nissan is starting to get it right in terms of the engineering itself while other manufacturers like Honda and Toyota are learning from Nissans mistakes and simply making them better although their relative inexperience has shown as well. Placing it on the type of vehicles is another whole story altogether.,Nissan,cfa2sj0,1,t5_2qwwh

If water got to the filter it got to your throttle body and thus into your engine. If his engine quit while in the water it definitely seized.The clicking is the starter solenoid engaging. You dont hear the starter because it cant turn over the engine since its seized.

5546179,0,t3_3r3h9a,The Z gets a lot of shit so yeah youre probably best asking someone whos driven one. The  Series have always got a good reputation for handling design and a lovely I so maybe the Z would be worse in comparison. Endless complaints about the interior sound setup and things like the same as the Z but a decade later. I always wondered how much is true. Long debates in my head about that...One other thing I guess is that I bet youll be forking out for a Nismo version I wonder how the Nismo zs price aligns with the M Sport  series and the M itself in your region but its going to be a fair bit.,Nissan,cwkjz7f,1,t5_2qwwh
5549604,0,t3_3r3h9a,IMO the  z is a vehicle designed to be tuned and customised to the fullest extent. You will not enjoy the sequential gearbox if youre coming from the BMW equivalent. My dad has an   Cabroilet auto and I would drive it any day over the  s I used to sell. With the brand new packages coming out this year Gs CAD for a manual base Z you have tons of options to make it an insane ride investing the equivalent or more of the base price in tuning and styling. As opposed to the  which comes out the box an insane ride at a higher price. But modding the bimmer is much more costly and intensivedifficult. Really as usual it comes down to preference. Base auto vs auto I would go BMW convertible vs convertible I would go BMW The drop top on th Z is a bit finicky but customisation vs customisation I would go Z. ,Nissan,cwkza7x,1,t5_2qwwh

A recall was issues for this but I would just go for a later one. Reliability is pretty high. I beat mine to hell I had a  Nismo and I loved that truck. It did whatever I asked of it including towing a car hauler pretty much up to the trucks limit. You will need brakes on the trailer and a controller if you do this.Gas mileage sucked. It got about  in the city and would just barely kiss  if you had a strong tailwind on the highway. It can develop issues with the timing chain guides which are pretty common across all the VQs. Has lots of torque for its size but nothing at the top of the rev range. Its a stroked . more or less so all its power is being produced by about  RPM.For the most part I just chaned the fluids and put gas in it for seven years and had no major problems.
