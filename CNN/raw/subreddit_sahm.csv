8463556,0,t3_4npw9z,  To get baby to sleep at night she needs to stop holding him for naps.  Crib training is hard.  Its the hardest thing Ive ever done in my life.  It might take her to the deepest of depressionsppd... so she needs unconditional help amp support in doing this.  I hired online help  personally.  Maybe ask a family member to come help or hire a nanny for a couple weeks.  Please stop working so much right now.  Its agony to wait for dad to get off work because of the loneliness.  Your marriage is going to hell so stop working so much and fix this now.  Help her get a routine help her open up her world by finding outings she and baby can go on spent time with baby so she can get out for her own walk... She is in a very dark sad lonely place and youre her ally.  Do the chores.  Give her small tasks when she looks to you because shes bored.  Shes overwhelmed and drowning right now.  Let go of the resentment and help her as if she were sick.  After you make a plan for crib training amp a plan to work less for awhile and after you two divide and conquer the chores and get into a routine... then help peel her away from the tv.  Its terrible for her and baby to have the tv on.  It causes depression and makes her unavailable for baby. Your family is in a deep dark hole right now  YOU need to save your family.  Recognize her inability to do it amp save her.,sahm,d5zhbon,2,t5_2truv
