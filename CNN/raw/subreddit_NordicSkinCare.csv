6517968,0,t1_cztgv25,Thank you! I have read that article but it all just sounds foreign to me and I havent heard of any of the products. Ill sit down and really take a look at it.I try not to touch my face but Im pretty sure thats the culprit. When I get tired or when I concentrate I tend to lean my face on my hand and its usually my left side. I try to be conscious about it but its so easy to slip up and not even notice. Ill also say that the problem isnt just my face but my whole body. I scar so easily and they leave really dark marks. A few weeks ago I scratched my leg a little too hard by accident and now I have a huge redbrown scar that looks like an open wound. From scratching myself! I cant remember being like this when I was younger.,NordicSkinCare,cztibkf,1,t5_32tiy
8575996,0,t3_4ud7tf,I would try a pH balancing product because they lock in moisture and keep your skin minerals balanced. I spent some winters living on the east coast of the US and it would get really cold. Sebameds products worked for me,NordicSkinCare,d6dkzct,1,t5_32tiy
