762505,0,t3_22w01o,The reason same this sentence wrong sounds.The ELI answer is that a style of music is a lot like a language or dialect in that there are a bunch of rules that people often subconsciously follow in order to be correct. Theres no universal formula for whether a note is right any more than there is a universal formula to tell if a sentence is grammatical.,ELI5Music,cgqyb8g,9,t5_2ya5b
2917050,0,t1_cnzl8em,Thank you for the answer. This makes me a lot more appreciative of technology in regards to music. It seems like every major invention has  a dramatic effect on the entire industry.Personally Id much rather hear a walking bass line instead of a sousaphone try to handle the low ends.  It seems moreappropriate. Then again Ive never heard a sousaphone in a jazz setting.Has anyone tried to find a solution to the issue that marching bands face?  To my ears it sounds like the brass section is always overpowering the woodwinds. I know I could barely even hear myself sometimesPlayed clarinet in middle school and high schoolMaybe one day well have mobile amps that can project a woodwinds sound without destroying the toneor being too big to march with.,ELI5Music,cnzod93,1,t5_2ya5b
