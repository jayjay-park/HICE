10443688,0,t3_5pj8u9,I think Jordan was trying really hard to get his view point of what truth is without mentioning God. I think that was the mistake. Jordans concept of God here is that God is truth. Now a statement like that is immediately going to be rejected by Harris. But here is the outworking. God is truth God is the highest moral value God is what enables us to see God is also beyond our comprehension. Harris then questions what we see and says surely this alone can be true without God it can be true! But Peterson says no! If it is True then it must also be moral and enable us to see!It might be accurate it might be a really good description but it is not truth. Because only God is truth. But we can never fully key part FULLY understand God. So what are we left with? Our collective iterations of partial truths that enable us to get a fuller and fuller picture of God. To put it another way that might be easier. The notion that only God is good is one that is around in christianity a lot. Now what this means in not that no person can do good things. but that only God can do ONLY good things things that are good now and for all time. We do not have the scope of all time to know if what we do now will be good in  or  years time. How can we say we are doing something good if it was only good now. I think if you sub in true you might get a bit more of what jordan was getting at. Truth for him is so much more than what really isOr i could be completely wrong.

10882522,0,t1_de2agws,This seems to be my conclusion too. Lets say you have two options take the red pill or take the blue pill. The red pill for me allows you to have more effective conversations every time you have them with everyone not just females. If you take the blue pill your approach to conversations is naive and powerless. You claim that The Red Pill distorts and violates your character by generally associating yourself with misogyny and that is the reason why you refuse to make your conversations scripted use recommended sexual strategies. But you dont really hate The Red Pill. JP talks once about how a good person is being powerful and not simply being naive. Most confuse naive with good. Its not the case. Naive is grace you just simply dont do things that might change you and as a result your character remains unchanged. Being powerful means actually entering territory that terrorizes and possibly corrupts your character. Without using will to preserve your character you become tempted to evil. So we know that those who will themselves good are superior in character than those who are by grace good.I hated going on pick up advice websites because I feared that my personality will change as a result. I was avoiding it like someone whos fearfully clinging on to his tradition when it appears to be no longer useful. Well turns out that the consequences of going on those websites leading to me being able to communicate better were desirable. I didnt actually hate those websites. What youre saying is very correct to me. So manipulation if it can even be called that leads to both parties being happy.. then its the right thing to do. ,JordanPeterson,de2gdsl,1,t5_32jqy

He is not the only one but not many are as engaging as lecturing as him. However I like his pre  class lectures somewhat better.

Maybe it takes a clinical psychologist to be this engaging as he should be more experienced in talking to ordinary people outside of intellectual milieu.I am really not a Sam Harris fan though. This kind of super rational materialist scientific thinking doesnt really go anywhere for me and he has a kind of arrogant attitude to me anyways. But obviously theres a place for him in the current heated debate about religion and education in the US. For better or worse I kinda like Zizek sometimes he does ramble incoherently and on some subjects he is totally off.

10930879,0,t3_5w30ya,Ive read the work of Eric Berne Transactional Analysis and he says that some people are unable to be intimatevulnerable. I find that to be true. So that eliminates a portion of people who arent vulnerable.Second perhaps some people just arent particularly deep or what they define as vulnerable perhaps doesnt match what you identify as such. Theres a great episode in the Big Bang Theory when Penny and Sheldon are sharing secrets  Penny assumes because of what Sheldon has shared that he isnt being vulnerable but he is... it just isnt particularly mutually well defined. This eliminates another small portion.Third Ive found one of two things as of late either everything is vulnerable for some people and thus every social transaction is surface level for fear of removing their mask or nothing is these are the people who share that theyve been sexually assaulted as quickly as theyll share what they ate that day for lunch. Ive also found that people have become highly defensive of their thoughts and are constantly on attack mode so if you disagree with them  even respectfully! and share your own thoughts on the matter you are immediately shut down and ejected from conversation. I think people are encouraged to sit down and shut up when it comes to any dissenting thought. I think this is an offshoot of the SJW movement everyone deserves to be respected and loved and any disagreement which even suggests the contrary is heresy. As a result people dont share their true thoughts unless they are PC  always having a mask on  no true vulnerability. I think this constitutes the majority of cases.

11016905,0,t1_degooob,This is another thing that Peterson is fond of pointing out  Men tend to mate across and down dominance hierarchies whereas women mate across and up dominance hierarchies.  So if youre a man insofar as your position in the hierarchy is gated by things outside your control e.g. IQ attractiveness and other genetically determined desirable traits your pool of potential mates trends toward woman at or below your position in the hierarchy and there isnt a clear way to equal those factors out in any sort of egalitarian Utopian way the pattern of significance is conversely true for woman.  So thats where things get complicated  you can tie yourself in knots trying to flatten out the social determinants of the hierarchy but its not apparent how one might go about flattening out the biological determinants of the hierarchy.  And its not clear thats something we should be striving toward anyway.  For example I would argue the smartest most competent and hardest working individuals have a right to their position at the top of the hierarchy.  Id rather have the positions of power which demand the most competence occupied by the most qualified people. Of course its not perfect but generally speaking if youre not qualified for a position of power the company or organization youre affiliated will suffer economically or otherwise and eventually youll be firedremoved from power... The best system is already in place  equal opportunity.  Any social efforts to improve things should be geared toward making that the case for anyone not trying to remove the hierarchy.  However the extent to which anyone climbs the hierarchy should be determined by their ability. Equality of outcome should never be the end goal.  ,JordanPeterson,degqhio,2,t5_32jqy

11104788,0,t1_deqmz2r,The thing is Dr. Peterson was influenced by Hannah Arendt. Now if you havent read The Origins of Totalitarianism on Dr. Petersons reading list you check it out. Its an absolute crushing read I havent read the whole thing admittedly I read about  pages of it in first year and was the first real articulated attempt at understanding totalitarianism. Most of the book focuses on Nazi Germany Arendt was a Jew and the book was released in  but also looks at Stalinist Russia. The takeaway point about totalitarianism is as follows please somebody correct me if I am wrong about this I am only in my second year of university totalitarian states place a law or process at the top of their hierarchy of belief. They exist to serve that law or process. In order to serve it they need to take away anything that interferes with it. For the Nazis it was the law of race and for the Stalinists the law of history. Since these laws obviously involve humans and some may argue describe the fundamental reality of human existence at least for the totalitarian state the only way to ensure the law or process is allowed to work without interference is to reduce human plurality to a calculable thing. Please keep in mind this is a simplified version of the argument.Now imagine reading The Origins of Totalitarianism and then The Gulag Archipelago while maturing during one of the peaks of the cold war. I believe Peterson took Arendts claim about Stalinist Russia and applied it to all of Marxism. He studied Maos China and studied communism and I think he was deeply terriffied about the threat of the law of history. For him its too simple of an explanation. Which is what Peterson identifies as the totalitarian mindset he may get this from Solzhenitsyn which follows from Arendts explanation about the totalitarian state micro vs. macro scale.As a Professor in the United States and in Canada he has had to watch university campuses shift farther and farther left both in student body and faculty my large Canadian university has at least  different communist clubs and zero related to free speech issues. He has said himself he doesnt understand how anybody can support communism after the th century.Peterson isnt your typical conservative who goes off about the mysterious left. Communism is accepted in universities many groups have Marxist leanings and then you have things like Bill C. The reason why Peterson doesnt go after conservatives as much he does though he charges the farright with having the same totalitarian ways of thinking warns against society shifting too far to right and urges conservatives to talk to leftists in the understanding that they can be wrong is because the left has gained a lot of traction in the last couple years. He is genuinely scared of Marxists because they are in his opinion fundamentally totalitarianEdit and that is just one side of Petersons arguments. He takes it from an existential perspective as well. He also probably takes issue with the materialist aspects of Marxism not that he doesnt believe in the material...but he does seem very concerned with the metaphysical as an important part of human existence ,JordanPeterson,deqpv9g,13,t5_32jqy

11327604,0,t1_dffxp3s,gtI didnt see you providing any definition of the ought either so how come we are suddenly arguing about a definition of the term?I actually did try to spell out various possible meanings of ought though obviously not every possible one.The point is that you are making a positive claim to which the notion of ought is central. There are of course many possible meanings the word could have so not defining it is assuming there is an obvious meaning. This I find quite ironic especially since you seem to like accusing people of simplistic thinking. gtYou said  but that is not what matters when asking about whether values are minddependent or mindindependent.gtAnd i replied to that part of the sentence withEither  OR eh?gtto which you repliedWell no. It actually comes down to those two.No. this is what I saidWell no. It actually comes down to those two. It is just a matter of defining what is meant by minddependence and mindindependence. In doing this various things are taken into consideration and you will end up with many options.You see that last sentence? I could extract at least  positions.For example questions in metaethics come to a large extent down to questions in epistemology metaphysics philosophy of language logic. In metaphysics and philosophy of language there is the debate between realism and antirealism. Realism states that true propositions are true in virtue of the state of affairs they correspond to antirealism says true propositions are true in virtue of coherence with other beliefs. For a realist having knowledge of mindindependent entities is having knowledge of entities that exist independently of us. To be realist about morality in this case would be to commit to the existence of moral entities. An antirealist however would say that the notion of mindindependence doesnt make sense. For an antirealist there could be minddependent moral knowledge while this knowledge would be objective in the sense that it is coherent with our beliefs. An antirealist would say that is all there is anyways.Another discussion that revolves around mind independence is the one about constructivism. A constructivist locates the core of morality in agents. A kantian constructivist might say that a human being has a certain nature and that we could derive moral principles according to that nature. Although the principles are derivative the nature is absolute. In this case we can speak of objectivity in that the principles are derived from an agent and is the same for every agent but it is only true given rhe nature of an agent. For the humean constructivist to the contrary...Depending on many assumptions that are not directly ethical one could take minddependenceindependence as a main question and shape dozens of positions by trying to provide an answer to it. I could go on much longer.gtgtI wouldnt be surprised if the number of metaethical positions I know is higher than the number of years you have been alive.gtThats a nonsensical and irrelevant shift of goal posts and quite a ridiculous statement too.It is not a nonsensical statement. Its truth value can fairly easily be empirically determined. Obviously it wasnt an argument though but rather a provocative statement  one that I suspect is true.,JordanPeterson,dffyr4c,1,t5_32jqy

Contrary topredictions from evolutionary theory the magnitude of gender differences varied across cultures.Contrary to predictions from the social role model gender differences were most pronounced inEuropean and American cultures in which traditional sex roles are minimized.

11555393,0,t1_dg5pgxi,I think I probably have to deal with numbing in and outside relationships for the rest of my life. In the past numbing would make me isolate myself but I realize now that half of the time we have to say no to our emotions even though our culture is telling us to embrace them and to do what feels right. I think thats how I can make it work by showing my feelings who is the man in the house. So lets say that Im cautiously optimistic about dating. I know its not a walk in the park but then again its not supposed to be.Another thing is to be open and honest thats the best way of putting your thoughts into proper perspective. Sometimes you think you are revealing something horrible or strange about yourself when in fact you arent. This has been hugely important for me. It also makes life much more interesting its amazing how much people will share with you after youve taken the first step and revealed something intimate about yourself.I actually ended a third relationship not too long ago. I wish that I couldve stayed but theres no point being with somebody who wants to keep all doors open indefinitely. Its a shame and its hard but it had to be done. Funny how she reminded me of the old me so I guess Im doing pretty well.There are two things in particular I do worry about in relation to dating. Firstly Im not a very social person my opportunities are few and far between. I can try to fix that but I dont really see it as a defect so I dont see why I should. Trying to change that almost feels like violence towards myself but maybe I can make small adjustments. Secondly my outlook on relationships and life in general is not compatible with modern dating culture. I have much more in common with older women than women of my age Im in my early thirties who tend to be too promiscuous for my taste or live under the spell of romantic illusions. Old fashioned values like responsibility honesty and decency are not in vogue.Sadly I dont have a thing for cougars.,JordanPeterson,dg5t34v,2,t5_32jqy

Does this make sense?The results of having more focused questions in this manner is that someone can come out with a conclusion that they are  more introverted than the average and also  more extroverted. This doesnt make sense if we view those characteristics as mutually exclusive but the world is coming around to the idea that this is no longer the case. ,JordanPeterson,dg60nob,1,t5_32jqy

11639950,0,t3_662p25,It is good that you phrased your problem with your sister in terms of your own internal state and not hers because after all you ARE influenced to act by YOUR internal state and NOT by hers. This is a way to speak honestly about how youre trying to formulate the truth without the arrogance of claiming that HER SOUL is your problem or that she owes you some commitment to the truth.Like uzyks says the only person you can sort out is yourself which is why its important to make ideological troubles mostly about yourself. In the worst case scenario your sister does not sort herself out but you at least sort yourself and your relationship with your sister out but at least that is something for you. The only way to really have a meaningful and strong positive influence on your sister at this point is to develop your personal relationship with her but theres a trap here. If youre only developing your relationship with your sister so that you can control her opinions youre not really going to experience an authentic relationship and youll fundamentally feel dishonest and at her mercy since shes ultimately gaining a power over you. This kind of weakness will make you resentful when your efforts are frustrated. So theres the rub you need to identify reasons to have a relationship with your sister such as your familial connection and history say otherwise your relationship will be inauthentic.I also wouldnt recommend spending what capital you have with your father by trying to control his opinion either  his vote barely matters and both candidates are terrible every election anyway.,JordanPeterson,dgfegzr,7,t5_32jqy

11681170,0,t3_66kqk6,I think before you learn to talk you have to learn to be quiet.  Let me explain...When I was younger I was pretty socially awkward.  I think it was in a different way than what youre describing but I often found myself falling a bit flat in conversation because I wasnt reading and responding to people correctly.  I was so concerned with my own participation in the conversation that I wasnt listening.  I had to learn to do THAT first.  I now feel much more capable and confident when I talk to others...not so much because I am such a great orator but because Ive learned to understand others and their motivations.Think about it this way most people are more interested in themselves than in you.  Instead of trying to force their friendship and interest through witty banter just be the listener for now.  If you feel insecure about how you should respond try a question instead.  In the case of the guy mentioning his ex instead of trying to laugh or frown or guess how he felt just try Man what was that like?  Let the other person tell you how to feel.  If you are mostly listening and asking questions people will start to respond to you much more warmly as well.  I think most of us feel pretty alone and isolated at times.  When we find ourselves in conversation it often feels like a competition of who can get the most of their own thoughtsideasstories in.  If you learn to be the person that lets other people vent their lives to you I think you will be surprised at how much they will appreciate you.Now this isnt to say that you should only ever be just a listener.  For now though while youre still feeling insecure about how to respond to people try it out.  After a while I think youll find that you are better able to understand and respond to the emotions that seem so confusing now.  Once you understand others your ability to respond to them will probably start to happen naturally.  Simply put you need to crawl learn to listen before you can walk learn to talk.  I know thats how it worked for me.  I used to steamroll others with my own ideas but now I enter a conversation mentioning myself very little and just asking a few questions to allow the other person to tell me about themselves.  Once I understand who they are and where their mind is at right at that moment then I can start to carry on a conversation that will be beneficial to both of us.   I think Ive heard Peterson mention something about listening on in one of his lectures but unfortunately my mind is drawing a blank on which one right now.  I believe it was one of the earlier ones on the audio podcast.  If some other user wanders across this post and remembers which it is please chime in!

11745973,0,t3_67liwy,The biggest part for me was paying very close attention to media coverage during a good  months of the presidential election. And I mean very close. I was probably was watching  hours of MSM daily while spending time readingwatching political news on RedditYoutube and listening to political podcasts during my commute to and from class.I would watch every rally Id read all the statements campaigns put out Id watch the interviews the debates anything and everything  I was fascinated with the whole thing. But then I began to notice more and more how the bottomthird or headlines the discussions the opening stories on CNN MSNBC and almost all print media were seemingly designed in a way to be technically true but to distort or misrepresent real events. I watched this happen over and over I saw it repeated in online media and on Reddit. I just realized that headlines could never be trusted and I was going to have to do the research myself if I ever wanted the truth.Its hard to pack it all into one comment partly because I honestly dont have the energy right now and partly because its a really complex process Im discovering is more difficult to translate into words than previously thought. That being said  the best thing to compare it to that Im sure some other Redditors can relate to is the process I underwent when traveling down the road of discovery that lead to my becoming an atheist which is now even more complicated since discovering Peterson. Just the way your whole worldview starts to crumble around you looking back and realizing everything you kind of just accepted as true growing up is actually bullshit.I began listening to conservative speakers who I wouldnt dare listen to in the past because now I needed to find out if everything I passively believed about them was true and I realized more and more that they were all pretty reasonable people with sound logic similar to Hitchens Dawkins Harris in the atheism analogy. After listening to people like Dave Rubin Ben Shapiro Steven Crowder Sargon of Akkad Jordan Peterson Stefan Molyneux Milo Yiannopoulous Gavin McInnes holy shit that guy is funny etc I just realized more and more that all the things I just believed about the right theyre racist homophobic Islamophobic hate the poor are greedy and so on and so on was because I was more or less following a trend that was a complete fabrication. I watched more Fox News and also realized that while they certainly have a conservative bias it wasnt nearly as extreme as Id been previously lead to believe. Same with conservative talk radio.It makes a lot of sense that protesters want to shut down all of these people theyre quite effect at redpilling through logic alone. The left doesnt have many voices like these on their side. They seem to function best when people are uninformed. I cringe so hard at the thought I ever took anything for The Young Turks seriously.I still consider myself IndependentLibertarian  but theres no doubt that I now lean right and I cant see myself every voting for a Democrat in the future.Thats not everything that I want to say but its better than nothing for now.edit Wrote this in a lazy hurry earlier.

11749334,0,t1_dgrq1jy,The girl you mentioned is the reason why frames in terms of Jordans terminology are so cool because the world is so complex and there are so many options once you decide on a frame you can filter everything through that and the people that do I admit are also mind blowing to me!Without that context of a frame the is why we struggle I think at least that is why I struggle because I am very much a person that sees all the different options and struggles to decide and I realise that deciding is better than not deciding but what do I choose? Heck all the things that have worked out badly in my life have come from not choosing but what do we need to choose? A frame. Because its the point of reference without any goal ideal or framework any option is as good as another.In terms of the book mentioning risk here I dig up my book notes interesting reading through my notes this time also seems like this is very similar to frames the author uses the idea of story instead.Writers like to have written. Rather than to write as writing can be painful. It is the same with your live you love the idea of the story but less so living it because  humans love comfort and order so even if there is comfort and that comfort means a life that is not nice or great its familiar we like comfort and do not like change because change could be worse. We do not risk and we do not want to change. The best stories come to those that fight fear. Its an emotion that will trick us to live a life that is neither meaningful or worth remembering.So basically taking risks leads to better stories better stories lead to better lives in general according to the book at least obviously thats within reason. You mentioned that a great movie is risk taking followed by great reward but there are still great stories without the great reward or even the ultimate happy ending perhaps the journey is the reward anyway so the risk is important to give you that journey.The essence of a story is a character is who wants something who overcomes conflict to get it.  The point of a story is the transformation of a character if life is like a story then the is the point of life. thats another quote I have written down. So the point would be how the risk shapes you rather than the final outcome. On the context of frames though... I found this passage interesting..We all want somebody to tell us what to say or to do. With religion we want God to tell us what to do with self help books we want somebody to tell us what to do we always want someone else to tell us what to do because we dont know what to do. They dont make self help books for dogs they dont dogs just are they dont pounder how to be a better dog.  Its harder being human than being a dog because we dont know what to do with the scenes we are given by the world. Without the principles of story life is just a serious of random experiences.In a true story ever scene goes somewhereDoesnt that seem true? Without the context of a frame or story in this case everything is just random experiences its this frame that links everything together and gives it a purpose. The frame could be an overall mission purpose goal outlook whatever again thats the beauty of life its so open ended you even get to decide what the frame means and how it works rather than just what it is. But it is needed to bring everything together.In terms of my own goals I am working on this still a lot for example I want to get fit and improve my body image so a milestone for me is posting a topless picture on instragram. Might sound douchey but for me to do this I would have to be in shape to a level that I am comfortable sharing if i do this I have gotten myself into shape and I am comfortable with my body image. I want to learn guitar so the milestone is that I can play  of my favourite songs from memory etc. I understand it can be difficult translating a what kind of person I want to be into a milestone but perhaps it helps to think of what that kind of person would do and then set milestones from that. For me I have the idea that i want to look and feel like a rockstar so then it translates downwards to the goal of getting into shape and then into that milestone as well as others and then playing my favourite songs on guitar etc is another part of that if that makes any sense.I understand what you are saying though I struggle a lot to try and figure out higher end stuff which is odd because I know where I want to go on the lower end but I feel like I cant go after that because i dont understand the higher end stuff to link it together.Your frame is yours you have it even if you dont directly decide it which is why its best that you do perhaps it is enough for you or perhaps it isint thats up to you.Of course it is okay for your frame to be who you want to be instead of what you want to do if you so wish what you do of course will change but who you want to be will likely be more set. What frame would you like to view the world as? How would you like to be? Is your frame that you need to be rooted in actual things so its all about stuff that you do or do you believe that its all about who you are that decision and frame is as much apart of the frame itself as anything else.,JordanPeterson,dgrteex,1,t5_32jqy
11757509,1,t1_dgsqf05,Postmodern thought as explained by Jordan and others has a huge hold on a large majority of selfprofessed Progressives SJWs farleft party gender fluidity activists etc... Anyway to call Jordan a Progressive is pretty misinformed and would point a lot of people towards ideologies he has consistently spoken out against.  And he has called himself a Classical Liberal many times which I as a Classical Liberal as well identify pretty heavily with. ,JordanPeterson,dgsqryr,0,t5_32jqy

11762152,0,t1_dgstdcs,Theres an important difference between progressivism and communism though.  The former holds the state is responsible for mediating equality.  Communism believes the state should be overthrown through an organic uprising of the proletariat.  Progressivism also isnt tantamount to socialism although socialism in the sense of community cost at community benefit a part of every single contemporary economy given theyre all called mixed economies is part of progressivism socialism as a full economic doctrine goes a step further and calls for the overthrow of private enterprise for statemediated economic activity.  Stateowned enterprises can and do totally exist within otherwise capitalist systems as with Singapore where  of GDP is the result of stateowned enterprises.  ,JordanPeterson,dgt9pj2,2,t5_32jqy
11765038,0,t1_dgtl5cv,Of course not but we also shouldnt attempt to tame every fire. Its much more nuanced and situation specific than Petersons generalities. That was his point.  Even Peterson thinks taming the fire of nuclear bombs was possibly not worth taming.    ,JordanPeterson,dgtli1u,1,t5_32jqy
11768737,0,t1_dgtrtl9,This is the video that introduced me to Peterson. I wasnt used to seeing people having a discussion like this and suddenly here are two learned people having an actual debate where they tried to communicate clearly and made an effort to understand each other. I was amazed. ,JordanPeterson,dgu0mmv,6,t5_32jqy
11775508,0,t1_dgus7wp,Postmodernism is conflicted in the sense that it cant make truth claims while also saying that Marxism is completely true roughly speaking and it should motivate postmodernists actions.,JordanPeterson,dgusfk9,1,t5_32jqy
11775656,0,t1_dgusfk9,When you say postmodernism says that Marxism is completely true paraphrasing you must be referring to a specific postmodernist philosopher because a theory cant say anything obviously... so which postmodernist philosopher claimed that Marxism is completely true?I would be surprised if anyone made this claim because Marxism is not something in itself that falls within a truefalse dichotomy. Its a style of analysis that is used to further certain goals... Im just not sure how one could say Marxism is true in an absolute sense... maybe more useful but not true.,JordanPeterson,dgut1im,1,t5_32jqy
