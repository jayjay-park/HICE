832528,0,t3_23mnb2,I had a  which had an EDMrifled barrel. I had no issues with excessive leading and all I ever shot through it was lead hollowbase wadcutter HBWC and lead semiwadcutter LSWC . Special loads I hadnt fired a single round of . Magnum through it by the time I sold it last year.One thing I did notice was that the EDMrifled barrel definitely preferred certain bullets over others. The new swaged lead bullets from Speer with the hard lube coating performed very poorly with that gun and were just fine in older guns with more traditional rifling  no accuracyconsistency to speak of terrible groups at even  yards. Remingtons swaged lead HBWC and LSWC bullets performed very well. Missouri Bullet Co.s cast bullets were meh again poor groups at  yards but I kinda expect that from highvolume castlead bullets.Cleaning wasnt any different than with other barrels as long as the load was appropriate there was no problem with excessive leading.,SmithAndWesson,cgywsq8,2,t5_2ueuf

3059855,0,t1_coekpsu,This would be my guess that or something in the optic setup.  Scope got bumped and some of the adjustments are looseinaccurate or the mount isnt fit to the receiver perfectly.  Lots of possibilities on an AR unfortunately.   ,SmithAndWesson,cof5g9q,3,t5_2ueuf
3840238,0,t3_34exmz,If you are chasing a  pound glock trigger the Apex trigger to get is the flat faced forward set trigger.  It is pretty expensive but you will end up with a very very nice trigger.  A . inch barrel on a . inch pistol would look pretty funky IMO.  I have this barrel and like it    ,SmithAndWesson,cqu0rd3,1,t5_2ueuf

11576997,0,t3_6587kt,The Shield is awesome indeed but I would suggest you have him consider an upgrade for the light. The gunlightknife combo is pretty much the holy trinity of preparedness but a simple small slim tail switch pocket light will serve him a lot better than some bulky holstered light.,SmithAndWesson,dg89br4,1,t5_2ueuf
