7767250,0,t1_d3p1u6j,Youre not alone I agree. This was a pretty boring review to me it felt like mostly car facts with the odd MEAT VOICE here and there. The kind of thing the very first review the Echo felt the need to overlay with BLAH BLAH BLAH and psychedelic color shifts.Then again Im hardly a typical RCR viewer I dont think. I live in Stockholm Sweden I dont own a car and go everywhere by public transport in fact I dont even have a drivers license. I know very little about cars and have basically zero interest in car facts. I dont read or watch anything else about cars at all. RCR is still top notch entertainment to me because it offers a often hilariously funny yet literate and philosophical insight into a nerd culture and a society that Im not part of. I yawn at engine designations but loved things like the FJ Cruiser reviews references to Baudrillard the Corolla reviews snap shot of lower class America and of course the yelling about Moab track days touring car champions and so on and so forth.I probably sound like a pretentious douche when saying this but I think RCR is a very insightful accessible and funny form of cultural criticism and study of contemporary society all through the lens of car culture. Thats an amazing accomplishment. A lot of YouTube commenters complain that you dont talk about the car enough but Id be very sad if it was reduced to just another talking about cars show for car nerds because Im not interested in that.

10919057,0,t1_de64k5t,Depends on budget. NA  are cheap but I wouldnt put any money into those motors. Theyre good cars though. Early ones had an issue with the nose of the crank more information here  The LSD that was available with the NA is a viscous unit and undesirable. Some failed under stock power while some managed to live for a long time. NA  are good. Bigger motor  more torque and power.  got OBDII which can be an upside or downside depending on what you want to do. The optional LSD was no longer a viscous unit but a Torsen. Learn about the Torsen here NB  picked up a little chassis stiffness and some torque best flowing non VVT head VICS intake manifold but my larger friends tell me they fit better in the NA. Interior got nicer with the NB too. Some early NBs had an issue with the thrust washers so be wary of especially low mileage s. You can google this issue.  speed became an option with the NB. Lots of people prefer the feel and gearing of the sp but the sp is generally regarded as a stronger transmission and is sought after by those looking to push whp. NB seats are known as surfboards and while comfortable dont offer the support of either the NA seats or the NB seats. NB  gained a little more weight picked up VVT have a better exhaust manifold than the NB but a worse intake manifold. Low end torque is the biggest benefactor of the VVT system. Mazda changed LSD manufacturers with the NB as well but I havent heard anything bad about the NB LSD. The front end got visually more aggressive than the NB and projector headlights were adopted. If you ever get into the motor youll find larger thrust washers on the NB than were used on the NA and NB. This is beneficial if you ever install a heavy pressure plate. Sport brakes became an option here with slightly larger rotors. Mazda also used a different head gasket than in the NB in an attempt to remedy the coolant flow issue that NAs and NBs have. It helped but is not as good as a true reroute. There are numerous vendors offering coolant reroutes to truly fix this problem and a coolant reroute should always be accompanied by the earlier head gasket.MSM  brought forced induction to the Miata family. The car gained weight particularly rotating mass with some oversized  wheels. Gearing is notoriously short on the MSM with a . rear end a sp shorter ratios than the sp and a lower redline. On the plus side the MSM got a variant of the sp with shot peened gears. Axles use a stronger CV design as well. Moderate power increases are fairly simple as with most turbo vehicles but if you ever want to go big youll replace nearly everything under the hood that makes an MSM an MSM. It should be noted here that the MSM did not retain the VVT of other NBs Mazda chose to use the BPW from the NB instead. IMO the drivetrain is the most desirable thing about the MSM but only if you change the differential gearing to a lower ratio. Im not terribly familiar with NCs but theyre heavier more comfy and make more power and torque. Retractable hardtop was an option too. Theyre good cars but are the biggest step away from the original idea of a Miata. Looks can be polarizing I dislike the NC but think the NC looks kinda cool. ND is a step back towards the NA and NB in size which is impressive with all the safety regulations that car manufacturers now have to abide by. Theyre cool cars and feel like proper Miatas. For myself I chose an NB. I suffered the pain of a thrust washer issue so now I have an NB block mated with the NB head. I also have the sp from a MSM and a . rear end. I abandoned the surfboard seats in favor of some fixed back Sparcos. I pretty much picked and choosed from NB and NB parts to get what I wanted. If I were to do it again I would probably look for an NB and go from there but the NB was a much better deal when I was shopping and I still prefer some elements of the NB. It seems like the NB is the best bargain on the market now NAs are starting to sneak up in price now that theyre  years old and the NB hasnt reached the bottom of its depreciation curve. ,regularcarreviews,de682fy,4,t5_2zzm9

11146835,0,t1_dev9zjq,gt DodgeChrysler arent reliable enough to compete with the Japanese. They arent cheap enough to compete with the Koreans. They dont have the quality to compete with the Europeans. And Jeeps are bought by inner city posers while serious offroaders go for Toyota Landcruisers or X HiLuxes.But I think the point youre missing here is that not only do they not hit those points they are one of the least reliable brands they dont make cheap vehicles and most people that actually want a off road vehicle will buy older trucks for cheap that they dont mind  banging up. I used to own a Jeep Cherokee from  and one thing that I found absurdly stupid was that the threads that attached the power steering pump to the engine block would strip themselves. I went to replace the factory steering pump and discovered that the threads were already stripped. I couldnt believe that a part of the ENGINE was softer than the bolts used to attach shit to it. My Grandfathers modified D was great. But it looks more like rust than truck. It has the Cummins which is really nice but the trucks are known for rusting around the engine. They dont compete with Chevy or Ford on price they are around the same or perhaps more. They dont really compete on power. They dont compete on reliability. They pretty much just compete on the Dodge name and the Ram brand that they created. In America at least SUVs are jokes. They are the next minivan. You dont buy a Highlander or Wrangler or god forbid a Grand Cherokee to offroad. They are for soccer moms who feel they are now too cool to drive around minivans. The only people who buy Minivans anymore or people who are either very utilitarian seeing nothing wrong with driving a minivan when it serves their purposes better considering they will never use the x function of an SUV or they have more kids than common sense and need the fact that they can shove  people into a van.Beyond that the Dodge lineup itself is odd.
