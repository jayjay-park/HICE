2274870,0,t3_2kw4o5,I agree with Mabepossibly... take it to a cobbler shoe guy and have them take a look.  They have bigger sewing machines specifically for leather.  Should be able to sort you out.,kilt,clsw5lw,3,t5_2qy9j

9302005,0,t1_d8uijuu,. That is great advice. I wore a vest with my kilt for my wedding super easy a style Im into and something that I had oddly been ignoring. A million thank youses. . That is without a doubt the gayest kilt site Ive ever seen. Whenever I go drinking in the Castro and end up a bit flopsy someone invariably says Oh great now Im the one hanging out with the drunk bear in a kilt or some version thereof. Now I know where the drunk bears get their kilts. At least I hope they get them from you. I super hope to one day travel to Cleveland and run into you or your partner and have some Kiltbro moment. On a different note though you clearly took some time taking a fair amount of pictures I cant see all the details of any particular kilt that Im interested in. I like to see things up close like the waist band snapsbuckles pockets how the pleats run in the back and the front flap. Most websites let me hover over the picture for a zoomed in view and have  or more shots of each kilt. Those  shots usually cover the details Im looking for.Anyhow great advice nice shop Im like the look of the shoes too but they look affordable enough that I doubt theyll be as comfortable as my old ass is used to. Many thanks!,kilt,d8v3hhs,3,t5_2qy9j

10978989,0,t3_5ptgzv,Sportkilt is good itll do. Get a casual sporran to make it look right. Its pricier than Sportkilt but for casual wear I prefer my premade wool kilt from Stillwater Kilts.,kilt,decfmlj,1,t5_2qy9j
