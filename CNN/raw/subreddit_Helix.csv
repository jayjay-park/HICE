91474,0,t1_ceooi33,SPOILER  DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVENT SEEN EPISODE  Oops... in episode  she spits up black gunk... so shes infected sorry if I spoiled anything for you. So looks like it was just sloppy production on this one. Although having said that I think there are different forms of infection. Because the other research chick with the shaky hand has a scar thing forming on her back. I think that shaky hand chic purposely botched the test to identify those who are infected the virus is in her mind now perhaps?.So ultimately who knows what is actually going but it does look like both the research ladies are infected. ,Helix,ceoudh2,2,t5_2s99b
173390,0,t3_1w1ggr,My guess as of right now? I think hes already immunized himself. Remember he tells alan that they were able to cure every disease known to man or any virus anyway. In essence theyve made it so humans cant get sick by anything. I think he probably experimented on himself and the eyes are a side effect. Its also why I think he brought Julia up. I think the whole outbreak was done on purpose to get julia up there as I think she is his daughter. The reason for him wanting  her there isnt too complex he wants to give her the immunization who knows what his plans are after that perhaps even destroy it so only he and the people he injects benefit from being immunized. ,Helix,cey6k49,2,t5_2s99b

3099939,0,t3_2vm017,There isnt a whole lot of information about him yet but its safe to assume that he was an Ilaria plant s just like Peter. The latest episode of Season  supports that conclusion as well. Whether he iswas actually a Army officer remains to be seen although youll notice he often wears his uniform a little more casually than one would expect a trained officer to rolledup sleeves for example.,Helix,cojb2nw,2,t5_2s99b
