5140711,0,t1_cv5my3l,gt so end result is kinda the same. That would happen with the last few animals yes but Im sure that if we were at the point where  of people where vegan and the last few animals were being killed there would be public outcry in making sure that these animals are taken safely to animal sanctuaries. I dont believe meat consumption will drop so rapidly to the point where farmers are actively culling their cattle to cut losses. It doesnt seem very realistic even if my incredibly unrealistic scenario were to take place.gtFrankly if I could life a live without working being well fed and cared for playing games frolicking in the fields for cows or something similar what would I care if I was eaten at the end?I think the reason veganism is rising in popularity is because the real world isnt so idyllic. I would be much more content if all animals lived satisfying happy lives but I think there are a number of problems with that kind of situation. First of all there are some products which simply cant be taken without harm and separation. In order to obtain milk from a cow we have to pregnate them. The calf drinking its mothers milk would lead to monetary losses. After all its consumers who are paying for the milk not the calf. Because of this calves are separated from their mothers sometimes only days after birth.This is as humane as it gets. If the calf is a girl she will have to go through the same kind of life as her mother. And lets not forget that even if we were to raise her as kindly as possible because we have abused these animals genetically in such a way to make them produce incredible amounts of milk she will likely have lifelong udder pain and back problems. If the calf is a boy because industries dont profit from male livestock that calf will likely be killed for veal only a few months after it is born sometimes even weeks.Animals also arent killed at the end of their natural lifespan nor do I think there would ever be a market for it. Meat from younger animals is supple and has a different flavor to very old animals. Some animals like the calves mentioned are killed very early in their life. Lamb is another example. Oh and eggs. Industries dont profit from male chicks so they are killed as soon as theyre born often in rather horrific ways such as being thrown in a grinder. gtI myself would sign up for that in a heartbeat. Would you also feel that a parent has the right to kill his  her child if the child has a happy life and a relatively painless death? If you had the choice between living in the wild and dying or being raised in a safe enclosure before being slaughtered even if you would sign up for the latter option surely you do agree that even though it is better that doesnt necessarily mean it is the kindest thing to do to you. gtAlso labgrown meat. Its exciting! I hope it comes out sooner rather than later.gthole world being vegan would kill way more animals than labmeat and maybe even more than eating cows seeing as how many animals die when harvesting fields. Because we cant feed all animals grass most domesticated animals eat grains. Instead of killing rodents with grain collecting machines fattening up the cow and then killing the cow why not simply eat the grains? Fruits and vegetables also kill fewer animals than grains.gtI mean.. you can even declaw cats! Seriously your animal laws are barbaricHahahaha Im actually an aussie! P ,likeus,cv5nc0a,1,t5_2xyw0

Arguing for shearing being a good thing is ignoring that humans are the root of the issue in the first place. We literally took an animal bred a genetic defect into it and then want credit for helping the animal live with said defect?!Also please look up mulesing and docking procedures that are often done to lambs without anaesthetics.

10249605,0,t1_dc5tcdm,The male gorilla was instantly aggressive and never figured it out because his instinct was to posture and not look the other gorilla in the eyes.  That over rode his sense of curiosity.  In your case your cat may naturally be passive aggressive towards other cats so while he is refusing to acknowledge the other cat he is not getting enough time to learn that it is him.  Im told some cats get it really easy while others never do even in the same household.,likeus,dc5ukxl,44,t5_2xyw0
10296052,0,t1_dcagiqj,edit okPeople get angry and frustrated sometimes when people dont agree with them that meat is murder. That is one reason I really dont want to plenty others too perhaps to discuss this issue. People take it personally.The first question imo is whether we should rationalise the how they feel or are based on our emotions? How do we know that they understand that they are bred for their meat or that they even feel imprisoned? I usually get responses like duh of course they have feelings and it is then when I leave a discussion. ,likeus,dcb43dc,-10,t5_2xyw0

11717109,0,t1_dgns6pf,The one that died was the asshole which I guess is the happy ending for this story? Of course they both died in the end as mortals are wont to doWe had the gentle giant first he was just a big stupid lovemuffin not much going on upstairs but very amicable and always happy to please just generally a great companion dog. After quite a few years everyone was growing up and generally had less time for the dog and we had a fairly big backyard so we thought it might be nice to get him a companion. I had done a lot of research on the kind of traits to look for when picking out a dog so naturally my brothers decided to just go ahead and buy one without consulting me while out shopping one day. They proudly shared with me the criteria they used for finding the absolute best one which as it happened went against all recommendations in the books I had read. I think they could tell it was a mistake within a few days though we were all sort of hoping he would grow out of his behavioral issues given that he was quite young when we got him.The new one caused enough problems that he pretty much ended up reducing the amount of walks that both of them got I hear weve had issues with that one actually attacking other peoples dogs I wasnt involved with that either as I refused to walk the asshole they had occasional fights over food and just random stuff on account of not really liking each other too much but they mostly got along with each other probably because the nice one generally stayed out of the bad ones way. Im sure the lovemuffin was able to sense that his quality of life generally went down when the new one showed up so when that one died maybe  years later the old one was noticeably more chipper for the rest of his life. He wasnt exactly trying to express joy or gratitude to us for the fact that the new one was gone but we could generally tell that he was much happier with his new circumstances.So much for getting the other one as a companion for the first one,likeus,dgo5w9b,4,t5_2xyw0
