2215206,0,t3_2kh77q,Its not very spacey but its kind of surreal... Y The Last Man is an awesome comic book series. I read this before i got into superhero comics and found it was a nice way to bridge the gap between non comic reader and comic reader. Its about a man and his monkey and they are the last males alive on the planet. Its pretty awesome. Rated R big time.  issues. Its funny actiony the characters are awesome and can be a real tear jerker. ,comicbooksuggest,cllemdi,3,t5_33dwa
