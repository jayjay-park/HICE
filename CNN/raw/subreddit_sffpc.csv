Not that you yourself was skimping on what could be done. I got the cheap feel when it had grease and dirt all over the panels.I was definitely disappointed when I first opened the box and noticed some alignment issues the way the pins on the panel were mounted but mostly just dirt all over it that I thought were scratches. Ive since gotten my build finished minus me forgetting to purchase a slim mm fan for the side to exhaust cpu heat out and the Sata power cables with the SF being T shaped so I cant mount my SSDs.All and all I am happy with the case.

Storage  definitely get SSD for at least your c drive preferably more...  bootload times are super fast much faster than a rpm hd   GPU Blower style cards are LOUD and only need to be used in certain builds so they can be avoided. You also dont need an itx card to build an itx machine since most of the nice cases fit full size cards.    Dont compromise on your gpu for a monitor buy the one you want and hold off on monitor till you recover from the build.     You can save money on a very nice monitor by buying a Korean IPS that may or may not have a stuck pixel... fraction the cost compared to the DellApple monitors these displays were rejected from...

8627122,0,t3_4xwqfz,you are overkilling the CPU cooling for k you dont need water cooling like this regular tower cooling is fine even when you OC plus it is quieter that water pump makes the unnecessary noise when the system is idling.Since you are getting a OEM OS go to kinguin.com  for a win Pro key.Go for silverstone W SFXL PSU as other people pointed out it is much quieter and W is enough for your  k. I use it for my i k evga  SC half potential OC no problemI still prefer a G SSd plus t . HDD instead of G ssd. First the price is the almost the same then for gaming SSD really wont help that much. PLUS BT downloading is a huge SSD killer my samsung SSD  g dead in  years after let it run BT sharing. Since then I alway only put OS and software in SSDor C everything else is in D that is it. Having small SSD is easier for system backup. I mirror copy my C every week basically I made a G sector by sector copy of the SSD to my backup drive a tt storage. I have never and will never trust backup and recover settings from windows. You dont want to see some kind of weird error stop you from recovering when that is the only hope to get your data back which never happen to mirror backuprecovery lesson learnt.Last check out jet.com their price is good NO TAX if you dont live in eastnorth coast. Not to mention that have  off for up to  order. split your parts to multiple  orders you get the idea.

8879482,0,t3_51sc4i,Your motherboard will be fine with your needs but people tend to get h boards for gaming builds with non k Intel CPUs.  You probably wont use the features that the H offers over the B like Intel Smart Sound Technology RAID Support Intel Smart Response Technology etc. but I dont see a reason to go with a B mobo unless you need some of its businessfocus features like Intel Stable Image Platform Program or you are getting a good deal on it.  Id recommend this Asus ITX mobo since I personally stick with this brand due to never having a problem with them but this AsRock ITX mobo is good enough for your needs and cheaper.Also both the mobo you chose and the mobos I recommended only support up to DDR RAM you have .  This G.Skill DDR RAM is the proper speed cheaper and has a lower CAS latency.This Sandisk SSD is cheaper but the performance between your choice and this SSD is probably negligible.  Both are TLC drives.  MLC drives are what people tend to recommend but you will need to pay another  to get into that tier of SSD.The i .GHz .GHz Turbo W you have is only  cheaper than the i .GHz .GHz Turbo W.  Might as well get the best non k i Skylake CPU with that small of a price difference.I cant comment on the quality of the W PSU that comes with the Node .  If you end up going with your own PSU I recommend the Corsair W SFX PSU  These come with unbraided cables which are easier to work with in small case enclosures.,sffpc,d7f6t3x,1,t5_39h7t

As for the cooling style a blower or dual fan would work fine IF you have  x mm intake fans. The way i have mine set up the GPU never sees anything over  C. So if you see a solid deal on a  thats dual fan style dont let that scare you away. CPU It wouldnt hurt to go with a k you get a higher clockspeed and you could always UNDERVOLT your CPU like i did. You can get stock  turbo speeds but at a lower temperature. If i can run a k under  C a k would be fine as it tends to run much cooler.My PC is very quiet even on full load. If you take a look at my buildpictures youll notice a Riing mm fan where the CPU cooler is. What i ended up doing was putting the Cryorig C HEATSINK ONLY on the CPU and a mm fan right ontop of it.

10957538,0,t1_dea5e25,The only real issue would be if mitx was abandoned which I dont see happening. If it were to happen it would be time for a new case by then anyway. If you currently have a quality PSU Id keep it in storage for later if  you ever go back to a full size build. But in terms of upgrading the case would not limit your ability to do so unless GPUs get bigger which I also dont see happening. Im sure there are extreme cards now that wont fit these small cases but Id consider a  high end at the moment and the EVGA variant I have fits just fine. In terms of Ryzen the main factors I see right now in considering a small PC are that the mini itx boards are not available yet from my understanding. In addition the launch this week is for the high end processors. If you are looking for an i alternative youll have to wait. Im also a little leery of the heat generation. Thats more important to consider in cases of this size. Granted if I were you Id still wait and see some reviews and whatnot but a couple months may not be long enough to wait for a mini itx ryzen build. Hope some of this is helpful. ,sffpc,dea6xav,1,t5_39h7t
