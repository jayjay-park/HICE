66846,0,t1_celgy6v,Short answer it gives an average error of .. Its not bad for  or  wickets down but it horribly off   or  wickets down. This might not be such a big deal as zerodown after  doesnt happen often and at  or  down the risk of getting all out is very major so wed need to consider that to be fair.Duckworth Lewis and VJD seem to both struggle because they only account for ratios with no consideration for absolute number of runs. Its surprising that nobodys picked it up yet a team zero down at  cant be expected to more than double their score as both DL and VJD predict since theyre already going fantastic. Conversely its not too hard for a team  down to double their score since theyve had a horrible start. There need to be some limits on the ratios.Ive contacted Cricinfo for more data hopefully this will sort things out. ,Cricket,cem1glv,2,t5_2qhe0

84072,0,t3_1v1aw2,For one they wouldnt be as good as Bangladesh. Glamorgan are not a very good team in county cricket. The only international prospect for Wales at the moment is James Harris Middlesex. Gareth Rees was promising but has no progressed as he looked like he could. Most of the rest of the Glammy team are not even Welsh I expect a Welsh national side would contain a few Englishmen which would not endear them to the Welsh public.Secondly there was a vote called for in the welsh assembly last year to make a Welsh ODI team but remain part of the England team in tests so as to keep their best players although I expect GilesEngland would not be happy about that and try to change it let alone the ICC.Thirdly there is a large and passionate cricket following in Wales I lived in Cardiff for many years and playedwatched cricket with lots of great guys who were big Glammy fans who ardently support England and Wales. It is unfair that it is not commonly called England and Wales but considering the small number of Welsh players generally called up it is not surprising. It is unfair when the Welsh public get negative press for hosting cricket as there are many many knowledgeable and passionate fans there.Obviously football is the biggest sport in Wales like the rest of the UK you can say it is rugby until your face turns blue but that is bullshit Cardiff and Swansea FC attendances are miles higher than the ScarletsBluesOspreys combined the public only turn out for internationals. Rugby is the second biggest sport and cricket could fight for third but only really in regions near CardiffSwanseaColwyn bay. Although cricket is very popular in south west Wales maybe moreso than football.I think the public would get behind a Welsh cricket team especially if playing England but competitive? I think Ireland would beat Wales to be honest. Rees Wallace Harris are very fine players but the majority of Welshborn players or even English born players for Glammy like Ben Wright hero would struggle to play at that level.The last time Wales played England they actually won!! But Wales had McCullum and Kallis among others and England was made up of old county players.Saying that I would love to see them get an ODI team and stay part of the test side and I would wish them well and support them against everyone but England.duw bendithia cymru,Cricket,ceo00tx,6,t5_2qhe0

156320,0,t3_1vvoa3,Lots of different reasons     Tests are longer and require your team to bat for longer periods to make the game safe or win so the natural style is to play more conservatively. Theres an adage about test cricket thats often brought out when a team plays silly shots and gets out for a low score in an innings quickly You cant win a test match in one session but you sure can lose it.   Red ball behaves differently to the white. In some countries it swings for longer and some people believe it reverseswings more prodigiously. Also the bowling side can get a new ball to bowl with after  overs which can prove a challenging time for the batting side. You generally want proper batsmen at the crease at this point as tail enders often get out quickly to a fast bowler bowling with a hard new ball.  ODIs have lots of fielding restrictions tests have few.   One of the most important no bowling restrictions. In ODIs each bowler can bowl a max of  overs. Often ODI fielding captains have to cobble together some overs from parttime bowlers who arent very good as the team selected has plenty of batsman in it and not always  proper quality bowlers. In tests your best bowlers can bowl as many overs as they want as long as they have the stamina for it. Theres a big difference between surviving  overs of Dale Steyn in a day with an attacking field setting and trying to score runs in a test than it is chancing your arm against Virat Kohli bowling mph dibblydobblies during the power play of an ODI.   Greater expectation on top order batsmen. They are expected to construct big innings and can take their time getting set. In an ODI it doesnt matter if you play more recklessly as you can expect tail enders to chance their arm and biff a few boundaries as there are only  overs max. In tests top order batsmen are more patient a they are the ones who need to put runs on the board.   Batting time. Fielding in the sun all day is hard work. As a batting side you want to keep your opponents out there as long as possible to tire them out and test their endurance to give yourself and advantage. This means batting time as well as scoring runs.     Plenty of other reasons too. Worth remembering that test cricket has been played for much longer than ODI cricket has and while ODI styles have definitely influenced tests tests have preserved a much older rhythm to the game. ,Cricket,cew8is6,44,t5_2qhe0

190625,0,t1_cf00y55,With respect to the game itself it has very little of the features that made me love cricket. Bowlers often bowl one or two over spells and the most important thing for both spinners and fast bowlers seems to be to mix it up as much as possible ie lots of variations. For me the best thing about watching bowling is the discipline the best bowlers have and the subtle changes that get the wickets. Eg this With regards to batting international players will tell you that you have to be tactical about your hitting but to be honest I still see at as a bit of a slog fest. Theres definitely an emphasis on big hits and shows of strength. I like seeing this but theres not enough grace elegance etc in T batting for me. With regard to fielding I think that T fielding is great and I think its had a positive impact on the fielding in the other  formats.As for a close T match I personally think the whole thing about it being exciting is far too manufactured for me. When you have last overlast ball finishes people say things like what a match!. But they only say that because of the fact that it went down to the last over. Its not in any way reflective of the actual quality of the cricket being played.If you look back at the match threads for the first Test for SA v India at Joburg after day  I was saying how excellent the  quality of cricket had been. I said the same thing at the end of the day  and by day  it turned out to be one of the best Tests of the modern era. Basically for me the quality of the cricket is more important than whether its a last ball finish or not. Though admittedly the Test I just used in my example went down to the last over too. ,Cricket,cf05haq,1,t5_2qhe0

Broad Anderson Onions plus a spinner would be a good selection with Stokes also available as a fourth seamer. Ive been impressed with Jordan during the oneday series. He might not have gotten the most wickets but I think his bowling has generally been tight. Id be tempted to bring him into the squad as backup to those three and Bresnan keeps his place as backup despite a disappointing series in Aus.

Different nations and teams perceive the risk of a Pakistan tour differently and I guess the Aus team was just a little bit more paranoid than others. They famously refused to play in Sri Lanka during the  World Cup as well. I honestly think the ICC should not get in the business of compelling teams to tour some country.gtAs the governing body with responsibility for the welfare of all members let alone a full member they could easily have helped with a roadmapNot really. Nobody in the world has a handle on how and when Pakistan will be a stable nation again. And when people around the world will deem it safe. PCB have been provided the opportunity to host home games in away venues and importantly not penalized for endangering the lives of Sri Lankan players. That really is the best the ICC could do.gt Its smallminded in the extreme to believe that politics should overrule sport particularly when it has the potential to do so much to help.The PCB is run by the Pakistani government.

Yet they refused we no one gives a fuck either. The suicide bombings and mass issues we see today are post .    This is the one point that commentators not FROM Pakistan love to conveniently forget. It helps them to get out of the sticky problem or having to connect the dots for the reasons why this is.    Similarly like the other shortsighted commentary here they love the cop out of ICC cant compel tours. NOWHERE is anyone asking for this. Literally nowhere. They are asking for the ICC to be more proactively involved in helping the scheduling of regular tours away or neutral as the ICC should do for its full members instead of enabling teams to ignore other members of they feel like it.

However if they get to  I think well bring him back in given the short turn around for the next test but maybe theyll be tempted to keep the same XI given the success they had with that policy during the ashes.As for who should be left out if they do bring him in? Well youd think itd be Doolan but it seems his place was more certain than Marshs going into this test. I think the initial plan was to have Doolan Clarke Smith and Watson at    and  respectively. It just doesnt make sense to drop Doolan after he made  runs on debut when Watson can open and Rogers only made .Ive got nothing against Rogers but as a matter of principle Id rather drop a player that didnt perform over one that did.

Everyone has complained about DRS but its only been overused because the umpiring has been so poor. Lyon not being given in the first innings Dharmasenas overturned decisions Steyn losing a review even when the ball would have hit the stumps Philander having to twice get his LBW appeals correctly overturned and so on and so forth. DRS is meant to overturn bad decisions through technology not be a fucking lotto game both captains must play. I can bet you that both captains umpire rating cards will be scathing.

Of course if you go way back all the players are either English or Australian. With the younger test nations its harder to unearth the type of alltime greats who are usually left off of alltime lists. On the other end of the specturm just looking at a list of alltime records for batting makes you realize how truly special Sangakkaras record is.This team might be a bowler short but two of the bowlers are from the days when guys could bowl  over spells without complaining. The team doesnt bat as deep as some of the more modern teams chosen but that doesnt matter when you have a handful of bowlers who average  and below.

Morkel caused some problem in that first innings with his accuracy and height  and Warners assault clearly disrupted his rhythm.Maybe Warners preseries comments about Philander played some part as well.

Naman is in good form with the bat and I would think he will keep wicket if picked and Dhoni play as a pure batsman. Dhonis glovework has been pretty shoddy so on both accounts Naman should benefit. Ashwin could IMO be a key factor in the next two games because of the number of left handers England has and their general lack of ability to pick a mystery spinner. Ashwin will have to bown at his best though to make a difference  if he serves up the same crap as past few international tours then we wont be in any better position.

Its not a crisis point but the stadiums arent selling out. The pull is the fact that test cricket is the highest level all the best players play and it is the true highest standard of cricket. The course of a match can change within an over and of course sitting with a few mates drinking beer all day in the sun watching international cricket can be quite a draw for those who enjoy that too.

2018444,0,t3_2hvdo7,I was upset about this also. However the Asian Games allows new countries like China and South Korea to put an effort and build a cricket team. Considering how seriously they prepare for the Olympics and the Asian Games strong countries like India and Pakistan wont give them a chance to compete and definitely wont allow them to get to the Quarter Finals. So this may be a very good outcome for the growth of cricket in my opinion. I would have paid good money to watch the Korean baseball players compete.

If he can preserve his accuracy with an action that looks different he could maintain his potency.

If I fail feel free to dispute it more vehemently than Younis did the PCB.I should make clear that I think the users on here who post gifs of every delivery of any guy whose arm they suspect isnt remotely straight are being excessively paranoid. I also believe  of offspinners who wear sleeves do so because theyre cold and throughout crickets history as you hint at it hasnt made a blind bit of difference to whether someones been reported. I guess that my point is that in the current situation where Ashwin is one of the few major offspinners who hasnt been banned it does help diffuse the tension a bit and stop people getting in a flap about whether hell be next. So I dont think its some admirably heroic act hes been doing it for most of his career anyway but I do feel it does help if only in the sense that it demonstrates to the uninformed that not all major offspinners are chuckers which you and I know to be complete rubbish anyway.On another note I dont see why people get so angry at people with only slightly dodgy actions anyway. Theyre not doing it on purpose and there are many worse things people do in cricket  Im not saying people should bowl whatever they want but I get surprised at the emotion this debate always ignites.,Cricket,clv4mdu,3,t5_2qhe0

I am all for ICC trying to get rid of chuckers and people who cheat . Now how about you also fix the other side of the problem and making the game more even between the bat and ball. Otherwise people will figure out other ways and things to exploit. And please dont say ohhhhh look at Dale Steyn... yes look at the best fucking bowler in the world. If everyone could be Dale Steyn no one would have an issue at all but unfortunately pace bowling  spin bowling is a dying art form in this day and age. Compared to past decades you can only count on  hand genuine pace bowlers and proper spinners in the game today. Before there were tons all playing in the same era and kept popping up one after the other.Something needs to be done about this the lack of genuine pace bowlers in todays world is disgustingly bad. It is a dying art form and cricket has more money today than ever before.,Cricket,clz67wc,3,t5_2qhe0

2618353,0,t3_2pv7bf,Watson needs to either be sacked for poor performance or moved to no higher than number  and relegated to a position fit for the all rounder that he is. Move Smith to number  and Johnson to number  or . Watsons performance so far this season has been nothing short of abysmal for a number  batsman and he is only a mediocre bowler to boot. He either needs to shape up quickly or be replaced in my opinion.On a happier note congratulations to Smith for a fantastic performance as captain at such a young age. I can see him being given the VC spot for the Ashes tour if he continues to perform. I have a feeling that Clarke may be hanging on for  more Ashes before he retires so theres the opportunity for a hand over to a really good young captain sometime next year. Same for Hadelman?. It must feel good to go out in your first international series and score a bowlers ton and nab  runs at number .,Cricket,cn0cv2h,3,t5_2qhe0

My point is that nobody cares whats moral or immoral so long as its legal. My other point which is designed to simplify things for your understanding is that if your meat and drink depended on winning games of cricket you will do whatever it takes to achieve that goal. Since the topic of conversation is sledging its entirely redundant to pretend that theres a line to be drawn or a point at which to intervene to stop the sledging. We have the laws of the game and sledging fits within them. Ricky Ponting is one of the most disliked Australian captains outside of Australia and for me that means he did his job right. Your opponents are not your friends and he was a master at amplifying every advantage he got hold of ethics be damned and that is why only the most ruthless teams last at the top of the test ladder. ,Cricket,cnnjn7g,1,t5_2qhe0

2827462,0,t3_2sgjnl,Pretty disheartening collapse from the Kiwis there. I dont really care about the runouts  thats probably just a mirage. However it makes you appreciate how much the line up depends on  batters one of whom was  not playing today. All the other batsmen can contribute on their day but not consistently. I am glad this is a long series because it really seems like Guptil and Taylor need every chance to get back into form. I remain confident that they can. I am a bit surprised at how bad taylor looked today. This time last year he was absolutely killing it and as far as I can tell not much has changed. He is class though and he will come right.Latham Guptil Elliot and Ronchi really need runs over the next  games.

2901855,0,t3_2tcn11,Most of the answers are simply afterfact rationalization. What it comes down to is what everything else in cricket comes down to  tradition. Traditionally captains have been mostly batsman and unless there are circumstances where the bastmen are all inexperienced or the bowlers are onceinageneration types Akram Waqar theyre chosen for captaincy. And specially in the recent times when the games have become more and more batfriendly the batsmen are almost solely thought of when talking captaincy. So while the likes of Johnson Steyn Ajmal would have been at least considered in previous generations today a random trait of theirs is used to justify their nonappointment. Johnson is too dumb. Steyn is too smart. Ajmal is well besides being banned too laidback. Anderson is apparently a lose cannon. Mohammad Irfan is too tall to be a captain. Ishant is too ugly etc etc ....,Cricket,cnxy3fp,10,t5_2qhe0

Chris Gayle Dale Steyn et al. cannot commit to play x amount of Fridays throughout the course of a season. Without big stars a change to a franchise system is essentially meaningless.

3086554,0,t1_cohvepb,gtCricket is not so desperately in need of newcomers and passersby that we have to water down the game for them.Were not talking about the game at large though just this subreddit. How long has rcricket had the Its a gentlemans game slogan? Even Test cricket shelved the idea of Timeless Tests after a while. gtIf we think of cricket more like classical music and less like laundry detergentI like the imagery but I also dont like limiting cricket to one form. Not all of us listen to classical music not all of us are the gentlemen that the slogan suggests hence my dislike for the slogan. If cricket becomes so starved of diversity of style and simple fun in the joyless pursuit of perfection and purity then this game will go the way of the dinosaurs in a generation. gtCricket is not so desperately in need of newcomers and passersby that we have to water down the game for them.Cricket is desperately in need of a shot in the arm though. Notwithstanding two or three Associate teams knocking on the door the organisational structure of the game seems to shrink every few years and the Big Three consolidation last year didnt reassure me that the future of the game is going to be healthy which is one reason I dont enjoy cricket or even rcricket as much as I used to.  Changing the slogan isnt going to make all of crickets problems go away  but if the mods intention is to put on a new coat of paint in anticipation of curious onlookers Its a gentlemans game is like the old relative who makes the odd antiquated comment at family gatherings a charming if peculiar and occasionally embarrassing reminder of a bygone era. ,Cricket,cohx4eg,2,t5_2qhe0

3128382,0,t1_com8hqr,gtThe pitch conditions is that the entire field or the zone where the bowler does puts the ball and where the batter is?The outfield doesnt matter as much.When I talk about the pitch Im referring to this Cricket has the most significant home field advantage of any sport I know mostly because of the pitch. Pitches in AustraliaSA are hard and bouncy generally pitches in new zealand have a bit of grass and offer swing movement for the bowlers pitches in indiasrilanka spin alot. This variation in cricket makes wins away from home that much more special.gtAlso I noticed the... I guess he is called a back catcher the dude with the gloves. I noticed he would be very close to the wickets hands on the ground right behind them. Other times he pushed back pretty far. Was that because the style of the bowler? Some had super long run ups with ridiculous speeds and others very short but had tons of movement with the ball. Hes the wicket keeper. Hes the only one whos allowed to have gloves.He stands back generally to the fast bowlers ones with run ups these bowlers bowl generally between  mph.He stands upto spinners for two reasons. One because they are slow so its easier. Secondly its because in cricket batsmen are allowed to move around in their crease and even step down the wicket. Batsmen do that to spinners alot because they are slower and they can negate the turn and dominate them. Heres an example However when the batsman misses if the keeper is close to the stumps he can get him out Heres an example of one getting a batsman out stumped when he missesgtCan the fielders tag the batter outside of what I would call the box?I dont understand what this means.,Cricket,com96kr,5,t5_2qhe0

3170003,0,t3_2wfitz,To start with BCCI is the only national level cricket organization from India that is recognized by ICC. If not in words but definitely in spirit  their team represents India. gtHow does one square the nearvirulent antipathy towards the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI with supporteven adulation or idolatryfor the team that wears its logo?We support them for their onfield play and most of us dont give a fuck about the logo that is on their shirt or the company that is sponsoring their bats. gtThe BCCI today in India and in the eyes of the cricketing world is a discredited organization whose various administrative decisions over the past fiveodd years are the subject of judicial and governmental scrutiny. It is rotten at the top so rotten in fact that the top exists at the mercy of the Supreme Court.Fair enough.gtAm I am supposed to place my unflinching unquestioning loyalty in the team and system it controls so tightly?My cousin worked at Satyam computers. When it was found out that their governing body was extremely corrupt we threw him out of our family.. sgtI dont support any cricket team in particular I enjoy watching the game as a contest. It has freed me to an extent because I can watch any team play for the sheer pleasure of it.Good for you!gtMost of my friends couldnt bear to watch Indias tour of Australia last year but I could enjoy Mitchell Johnsons bowling and Steven Smiths battingSure they played well! But the very fact that he didnt mention even one among Kohli Rahane and Vijay makes me doubt his neutrality. There is nothing wrong in being antiIndia. Just dont call yourself neutral thats all.gtThis team represents a private trust worth several thousand crores of rupees.He doesnt explain why it is wrong to be worth several thousand crores of rupees.gtParaphrasing I hate the fact that nationalism  jingoism  Games becoming war minus shooting built up into a heavilyfinanced activity capable of attracting vast crowds and rousing savage passions.Cricket already is struggling to expand. So let us strive to make the game more mundane and dull. s The jingoism and nationalism is what adds romance to the game imo and it is never ever ever a bad thing if such jingoism can bring people from Mumbai Bangalore San Franciscoetc. to Adelaide to watch an hour game. Your elitism can die.gtIndian cricket needed ringfencing from its own frailties and the sponsors needed an assurance of an Indian team in the final stages of global tournaments. Within months was born a highprofile bigmoney tournament at which an Indian team was assured of victory. Enter the Indian Premier League.Either he thinks that the IPL is a global tournament or that is a really poor choice of successive statements. Either way lol.gtThe loyalty is to the game as it should be. If youre looking for war join the army.Is there any other team sport where fans are questioned for being fiercely loyal to a team? If he thinks bringing intensity and passion to a game is like going to a war he is insulting everyone who actually fight for their countries.gtJayaditya Gupta is the executive editor of Espncricinfo.Aahhh ,Cricket,coqki92,3,t5_2qhe0

Its so easy to fall in to the trap that the Taliban was a bad organization but of course as I have learned time and time again nothing is that simple and its such a complex varied situation and group that you cant judge anything that decisively. The Taliban did quite a lot of wonderful things during their time but their power also facilitated the crumbling of Afghanistan and some more conservative within the group took too much control.

3330370,0,t1_cp7vqvx,Well shoaib has been outstanding in the big bash series scoring   and . He has tons of experience and can handle things well under pressure. He was very fit to go. Razzaq is just a legend. He has won countless games for us. He is an excellent all rounder with bating capabilities like Afridi and Umar Akmal combined. Excellent player. Also I wouldnt mind if you would tell me what amazing things Rahat Ali Ehsan Adil Sohail Khan Yasir Shah and Haris Sohail had done before the world cup started. Not much. But they were still selected.This is the mega event. We need all our experienced and most reliable players out in the field players we can be a lot more comfortable with. I was pretty scared with the match against SA because of our experienced bowling line up going against the likes of Hashim Amla and De Villiers. They managed to pull it off but all Im trying to get at is the more experienced and world class players we have we as fans will be more comfortable.,Cricket,cp7w0g1,2,t5_2qhe0

3348324,0,t3_2yfjyo,I saw this dismissal. When the bat was passing the crease it was grounded and the batsman was sliding it along the ground and also the bails were in tact. After that as the shoulder of the bat reached the ground with the dive the bat bounced up and at that moment the bails were dislodged. Out or not?The argument here is that the batsman has grounded the bat way before the bails were dislodged. But still its OUT because the ball is not dead yet. If this is not out it will also be not out when the bails are dislodged when a batsman is turning around and lifting the bat for another run after reaching the crease once.,Cricket,cp9xnh7,2,t5_2qhe0

Finally what we need are deeper structural changes. Weve been including associates since  as far as I can remember. None of them are any better now than they were before. So clearly this line of thinking is not working. Now I dont know what the solutions are.

3485273,0,t1_cppee7m,This doesnt exactly answer OPs post or relate to what you said but is more about how stringent and maybe even backward the ICC are.The  Final was played in rain and without proper lighting for the last  over or so and it got dangerous to the point where Australia had to only use their spinner. At one point the broadcast removed their filters to show what it actually looked like on the field and you honestly couldnt see anyone apart from the batsmen and the keeper.  In the end it didnt end up making a difference because of how far behind SL were in the run chase but it just goes to show that the ICC really hates making use of that reserve day. ,Cricket,cppjo4x,1,t5_2qhe0

3490101,0,t1_cpq2wtm,Personally I think the rivalry with India is bigger than the Kiwis.Recently there is just a lack of games with NZ so there is no real recent history.SA is a good rivalry but its really all about the cricket for the last decade its really been considered the top two nations going at it.But India vs Aus is spiteful aggressive and desperate. It is such a huge achievement for either team to win away from home. I think Australians with only FTA miss out on it a bit because when India tour it might seem like a walk over and when we tour they dont see it. As the article describes recent history between the sides has had many boiling points cricket and personality wise.Only part of the article Id disagree with is when he says IPL lets guys get to know each other and then like or despise them. I think aside from the Symonds vs Harbhajan feud these days the anger is left on the pitch and off the pitch the guys get along.Thats one thing Im really starting the like about the rivalry similarly to what we have with the Poms the Indians are coming around to the idea that we will be absolute cunts to them on the field. But once you walk off the field or join up in IPL we can be good mates and share a beer.Hell in the interview with Fox Kohli even mentioned he likes having a talk to Warner off the field.,Cricket,cpq3hcg,15,t5_2qhe0

Any sources or is this just conjecture to fit your narrative?Dropped catches are a part of the game and with the same token you can only imagine how many dropped catches Wasim Waqar Saqlain suffered?Also Srinath never consistently reached or bowled kph at any point in his career. He was a good bowler but this revisionist history is making him seem like he is to be remembered alongside Wasim and McGrath.Further denouncing stats in his average and then using stats strike rate to make your case doesnt really make sense. ,Cricket,cpq4mn2,0,t5_2qhe0

During the drinks break the players are only allowed to drink tea. The umpire must stand behind the stumps so he can hide behind them when the ball is hit in his direction. A fast bowler must give a batsman a helpful piece of advice after they have played a poor shot. When a player gets hit on the kneecap the bowler can appeal to the umpire for dismissal by Knobbly Knee if the umpire points at the sky the batsman has to walk off and the third umpire will spank his knee with the Knobbly Board. When a batsman hits the ball they must run from one end to the other until a fieldsman manages to hit them on the head with the ball.  ,Cricket,cpu0h9k,6,t5_2qhe0

3735663,0,t1_cqi2yw0,I read an article that stated how batters cant see the pitches in baseball when they come a bit too near. From there the batter just have to predict where it will come. i think its almost the same in cricket but the  yard distance is enough for them to predict where the ball will land and play the shot accordingly. This is extremely tough in the beginning since the batsmen are unsure of external factors such as variation swing bounce and the speed of the wicket.,Cricket,cqi39eq,3,t5_2qhe0
3735845,0,t1_cqi2yw0,It is based on prediction rather than seeing the ball and playing and it all happens extremely quickly to the point where the calculations are subconscious.It starts with the bowler the angle on the crease release point action etc all of this information helps the batsmen determine the flight path and speed of the ball. At the release the batsmen starts to gather information on the flight path. Instead of tracking the movement of the ball exactly the batsmen uses prediction to jump ahead to where the ball should be. So the batsmen jumps ahead to their next point of focus and captures another set of data recalculates and jumps ahead again.The next major point of focus is the bounce. This works as a sort of update on the first lot of information so you can do recalculations. The batsman can work out the path of the ball from where it bounces and predicts where it is going.The final point of focus is the point of impact on the bat. This is important for the future. Watching the impact lets you know how your predictions are going. Calculations can be adjusted based on the results of previous balls.One interesting aspect of how a batsmen tracks the ball is how the length of delivery changes how a batsmen perceives the pace of a delivery. One thing you hear quite often is that bouncers are perceived to be faster than full deliveries. We know that it is impossible due to physics so why do batsmen perceive shorter balls as faster?The answer is with the first and most important set of calculations. A batsmen first predicts the path of the ball based on information they receive at the point of release and a fraction of the path after. They use prediction to jump ahead and track the ball in fragments using prediction. The less flight data the batsmen can gather before a ball bounces the faster they perceive the ball to be. In other words the brain is good at predicting the path of the ball out of the bowlers hand. The brain perceives the ball to be slower if it has time to collect more data and recalculate the flight path. The brain is not so good at doing this from the bounce of the ball since it is less predictable. Since it takes the brain longer to do calculations after the bounce it can only collect limited data. A majority of the data the brain uses comes before the bounce. Hence a full ball is perceived as slower since the brain has more data on the path it is taking. ,Cricket,cqi409r,5,t5_2qhe0

3745451,0,t1_cqj72ey,Let me put this in a real simple way. Batsman are averaging higher in s as compared to s or s. What that means is they are scoring more runs for every time they get out. Now they cant score more runs in a vacuum. Someone has to concede those runs. So bowlers are conceding more runs as compared to s or s. Bowling averages are therefore higher than that era. Dale Steyn has stats comparable to best bowlers of s when everyone else is getting taken to the cleaners. This is as objective as it gets. No subjective stuff like oh maybe they are more aggressive they are making more mistakes etc. If batsman being aggressive was a luxury more bowlers would have a low average. As plain and simple as that. Wasim was not even undisputed best bowler of s. In my eyes he was. But a case could be made for Waqar or Ambrose or Mcgrath. Steyn is head and shoulders above everyone else out there right now. Anyways no point in arguing. They are both all time greats at the end of the day and any argument is just nitpicking. ,Cricket,cqj7fym,1,t5_2qhe0

He did decent in the second innings of the last test but didnt do much in the last innings where the pitch was more abrasive. Unfortunately he is injured.Adil Rashid is in the squad because of his performance for Yorkshire but was apparently bowling awfully in the nets and the warm ups you cant get selected for a Test doing that.  Moeen is between a parttime and fulltime spinner and has some weight because of his performance last summer.

3901260,1,t3_354gso,Its a subcontinent thing. Notice the use of gold and silver colours on the uniforms. In India financial superiority often transcends moral and ethical grounds as well. So being rich often also means superior in almost every other way just as being poor is the ultimate curse. For example there is no worse way to insult someone than reminding them of their lower financial class. Barring a brief period around s the the Indian media is saturated with depictions of the wealthy as being just wise and morally elevated. The average Bollywood movie for example has this hero who lives in a mansion and has Mercedes at his disposal. Now  all rich are not the same. Old money is preffered over recently accumulated wealth even if the latter far exceeds the former. In fact its not uncommon to see someone brag about his inherited wealth in the similar vein that one would about personal achievements. So there is this class ladder at the top of which sits the royalty coz that means the wealth has been accumulated over generations and generations.Having said that this mentality is not uberdominant and there are tons of exceptions. This is the most simplified version of a much more complicated phenomenon. Edit not surprised at the downvotes,Cricket,cr0z7wg,4,t5_2qhe0

I havent caught much of the IPL so did I miss something?I wont touch on England much but even if Im wrong and theres some restriction on them playing they have the Natwest T to get top level practice in with solid competition on more demanding and balanced pitches than the IPL.As for how its affected Pakistan who I know doesnt have any players in the IPL barring Azhar Mahmood it limits the players from a tournament with a good level of competition but I dont feel it hampers the countrys side much.At the end of the day it is T cricket and the weakest format to develop talent forward into world class versatile players in my opinion.T is the only format where you can be a hack and still cut it  you cant in ODIs and Tests.For Pakistan we did have a domestic T tournament with top level players from all over the country playing and while we did find a few new faces to put into the watchlist I think viewing consistent performances in List A and First Class matches is a far better way to judge talent than from a T tournament.The T stars we do have that would have probably started for IPL teams are already proven players we wouldnt have youngsters over there to emerge as fresh talents and further the squad.Furthermore going to the IPL with the mega contracts always holds the possibility of a player getting involved in dirty matters including fixing and even laziness for the national squad if you are aware that youll still hold a bunch of cash in your arms in the IPL at the end of the day.

Yes the upper limit might be lower because of differences in female vs. male body typegenetics but the biggest strongest females are definitely as strong if not stronger than the smallest guys playing. Half of the associate teams cant react to a kmh bouncer but they arent told they shouldnt play because theyll get destroyed. Even if they never play test match cricket for a national team Im  sure there are a handful of players that could play county or state cricket.

Increase the number of seam threads make it seam and spin more too. Make it naturally tough for the batsmen to score.  With the belligerent attitude of batsmen world over start making tough pitches and push the boundaries out. This will help batters adapt to conditions and combine their attitude with skill to create a balance.  No field restrictions for the last ten overs. Give freedom to captains to exercise their acumen.

He was selfish in doing this just to get his paychecks and the team suffered as a result. Does anyone remember the coach of Australia calling him the cancer of the side? He has had no respect or chemistry with many of the players as this was lost long ago. How many games have our bowlers not been able to go off for  mins for treatment after a spell because Watto has been on the massage table? Does the game when Siddle The Lionheart was close to collapse ring a bell? Opposition players would often mock him by pretending to injure themselves when fielding a ball hit by Watto.

4576805,0,t1_ct7hb4x,Yes but its the highest form of the game so its a good way to learn imo. I mean you have two innings to bat each player bats twice  wickets or outs. Over the course of  days you as a batsman can only bat twice  that means you have to make the most of it. So far in the ashes the Aussies came out and batted to . Steve Smith made over  runs and Chris Rogers made something. Going into Day  England have lost  wickets for runs so they have to try to make up  runs with  players yet to bat. Thats just the first innings. Both Australia and England will get to bat again. How soon? How long? No one can say... Edit some pearls to keep in mind these arent rules in any sense but guidelinesYou just about always want to bat first. Its a psychological thing. You have to take  wickets to win a test match. It doesnt matter how many runs you score if you cant get the other team out  it would be a draw uhh dont worry too much about thisYou nick it you walk fly rule in baseball  hit it in the air and its caught youre out.Notice that a batsman can score in just about a  degree circle this is one of the most interesting points of the game if youre coming from baseball. ,Cricket,ct7ihnp,1,t5_2qhe0

It has been a genuine pleasure and a joy to watch that man with both bat and gloves and I hope he is hearing that more than ever right now.  He was the reason that I became a WK myself and the reason I loved it despite the dozens of bruises across my chest keeping is NOT like being a catcher in baseball and adapting was tougher than I expected and the memorable bail to the face.  Ive lost favourite players before in other sports and it always stung but they were all my favourites after having been engaged with the sport for some time.  He was my introduction to cricket and now that hes leaving... I dont really have words for it.  I dont love the sport any less but its never going to be quite the same for me.

In my opinion putting Root up to  would be the ideal solution it would give Cook someone to partner early on assuming Lyth does the inevitable and nicks outside off stump after  overs and relieve the pressure off Bell so he isnt coming in at . I suppose England are so reliant on Roots batting at the moment that they cant afford to risk his current form so it makes sense in that context.,Cricket,ctbwcio,1,t5_2qhe0

4965818,0,t3_3iv9yr,This seems like an impulsive rant after Pujaras ton but it has little nuggets of truth hidden in it I feel.It is true that Kohli needs to mature a little bit as captain. However he is still young and you can still perceive the rushes of blood to his head. His aggressive demeanour and approach are good for our game but the implementation has been faulty at times. This socalled aggression also seeps into his batting sometimes like yesterday when he got out fishing on a fourthstump line vying to dominate when he needed to grind.I understand his pursuit of  wickets and fully support it. The Binny decision is odd but I think the team overestimates Binny in both departments. We need a better allrounder to be groomed. About the batting order I think the criticism leveled at him for the Rohit Sharma selection is justified. He brought in Sharma at  then moved a prolific and settled  arguably the best bat in the team to  to protect Sharma. This is simply not done. We have a set  we have a  waiting in the wings and so the fight should be for one spot. It seems he is adamant beyond reason to play Sharma no matter what based on his perception of Sharma being aggressive. I would like to contend that aggression is not always a . I think classier more efficacious aggression is the sort of thing Pujara did yesterday. Grit and gumption are essential commodities in Test cricket and in a batting order full of belligerence they might be lost somewhere. We need an anchor. An anchor who hinges the batting about him who blunts the new ball and most essentially has the temperament to shield the batting at . I think we all know Pujara has shown that longterm class mindset and hunger. I believe a batting order needs to be settled especially at the top because  are highly specialized roles. For this reason we need to have a designated and able  which I think clearly is Pujara. Rohit might be a good batsman but his proper place seems at  or  where we do not have a spot. His fans keep bandying about numbers that he has got only  Tests and so on but the problem here is not the number of runs he scores or the innings he gets it is rather the manner in which he gets out every time and how outofhisdepth he looks on the crease mostly. He does not look like he belongs at the  spot from any angle. And we cannot sacrifice that spot or the player that Pujara is for accommodating one player who looks unsuited to Test cricket till now. People also say Pujara has had a bad run of form. People go through patches. He was quietly effective in using up the new ball in England he was great in South Africa and he just had low scores in Australia and NZ. He got a  and a  at Lords and Nottingham. He also played  balls in Nottingham over  innings and played  in Lords. He had a lean run over  innings in New Zealand but then got a  in Adelaide a  at Brisbane consuming  balls over the  innings. The next match he played was at the SSC and we all know what happened there. In my view this is not poor form this is just a lean patch in terms of getting humongous scores. As we can see though not getting s he mostly blunted the new ball a very important job. Do not forget that post his drop he also has a  and a  for Yorkshire. This is like how Vijays ball s were ignored in SA. It was only when he started scoring big was he noticed and decorated as Indias most consistent batter. His vigils in SA were as classy and important and indicative of class and form as his big tons. Peoples grouse with Rohit Sharma is that he keeps a good batsman out of the team. He might deserve to be in the team but he surely does not deserve a place in this team. Rohit might have a Gilchristesque role of late blaster in an order with  proper batsmen but in this  combine I do not think he should have a place. Pujara is better with everything temperament technique grit class application and I would even wager to say with confidence aggression. Aggression is not going out shouting to the line to shoot three enemy troops in dramatic fashion and getting shot yourself in some Bollywood drama. It is staying there grinding it out so that when the time comes you can kill many more. You win wars by staying alive. Simple. I hope Kohli learns from the .

5075527,0,t1_cuxs4xz,gt Are you seriously saying that the act of preparing a pitch in itself is doctoring? That is perhaps the most ridiculous argument over pitch doctoring I have ever heard seriously.Actually if you read your own comment youll see thats what youre saying. I cant believe people seem to have a blind spot when it comes to the fair Australian way of preparing pitches and the dirtycheating way that everyone else does it. You know what ACTUAL pitch doctoring looks like? It looks like when games were played on coir matting and players were worried that people would sneak onto the ground at night and adjust the tension. You can look up what Richie Benaud had to say about this and how hed make sure that the matting wasnt loosened and renailed when his side had to bat in Pakistan and India.       gt Australian pitches are not fast and bouncy because they are doctored they are fast and bouncy because it is hot and sunny here.   So youre saying if I found a random chunk of grass anywhere in Australia it would play like the WACA? No it wouldnt and its nonsense to pretend that the performance of the pitch isnt a direct result of how its been prepared by the curator. Otherwise every pitch in Australia would play the same way and looking at the last home season vs India obviously isnt the case.    gt A pitch should be prepared to provide a decent contest between bat and ball in accordance to local conditions by the curator.      Tell me more about how this wasnt the case this summer.      gt When teams are directing curators to prepare pitches to create an advantage you have a problem     You can read what Anderson said on this yourself  he said that every team prepares pitches to play to their home sides strengths. As far as I can tell its only Australia that seem to pretend that they dont do this and that its an act of god whenever the wicket ends up favouring the home side.    gt Why dont we all hold hands dance in a circle and bring on world peace? The entire point behind pitch doctoring is that no team will ever perform equally on all pitches and you can take advantage of that.        What. The. Fuck. This is a pissweak excuse for flopping on conditions that are unfamiliar from home. Thats the whole goddam point of touring and playing away. And none of this explains why an away team cant exploit the same advantages. BECAUSE ITS THE SAME GODDAM PITCH. When England prepared a greentop last year wouldnt you know it Ishant Sharma prospered. England got spinning pitches throughout  and MontySwann took bagfuls of wickets. Pakistan came to England in  and spells of sharp fast bowling on helpful pitches just like England did. Their batting flopped hard and they got bashed in the matches and I dont recall a single complaint of pitch doctoring just because our batsmen couldnt handle the swing.    Absolutely nothing about this addresses the fact that both sides play on the same surface. Its entirely about the ability and experience of the cricketers.  ,Cricket,cuxsjez,3,t5_2qhe0

Iyer Pandya Negi Chahal Hooda Suryakumar... theres a bunch of talent that we can give a few chances over the next year or so.Were sort of stagnating as a team and trying out new players will give them exposure to some international cricket. Even if they fail thats not a problem... they can go back to domestic cricket and work with their coaches to get better at those aspects of their game. Itll serve us well in the long run to become a more flexible team.At the moment were still OK as a team. When Dhoni goes though theres nobody in domestic cricket who will come and assume his role with ease. There are either serious hitters with no composure or technicians with no power. Raina too is very hit or miss.So start by introducing Gurkeerat next match in place of Binny and play Axar in place of Ashwin unless obviously Ashwin comes back.

This illustrates how much pressure Dhoni put on the other batsmen through lack of acceleration. The wickets that fell on the other end were partly due to this pressure. Of course its not entirely his fault  others couldnt get it done either and SAFfers bowled and played very beautifully.....but there were only two accomplished batsmen left other than Dhoni. with not much expected from Binny Ashwin hurt and the tail enders never great.

Takes individual player stats and finally takes the recent win streak and high player average of each team  year difference.Finally at the end it wraps up together and gives a ratio out of .  Team Loss  Draw  WinBut sadly I never finished this program. If you run it now it does only  of stuff I mentioned above and the probability of receiving a team wining score is around ..

Now I understand why I need comments because I dont even remember how my own algorithm works.

5385692,0,t1_cvzrohl,Honestly I think the direct payouts to Associate boards are a bit of a red herring. Whilst they obviously compare extremely unfavourably with those of lowerranked less powerful full members let alone the Big Three the fact is most Associate and Affiliate boards even those that arent lamentably corrupt or comically incompetent generally lack the institutional capacity or wherewithal to make the best use of the money.The issue I have with the funding structure isnt that the ICC doesnt pay out enough its that it pays out far too much. The ICC is almost unique amongst sports federations in that it effectively has no control over the revenues generated by its own events. Rather than increasing direct disbursements to its members be they full members or associates Id like to see the ICC retain control of its own money spending a substantial portion of it on development regional and tiertwo tournaments grassroots initiatives the restoration of regional development bodies such as the ACC and ICC Europe and more broadly global promotion of the game and indeed the continuation and expansion of the Test Cricket Fund  even though in the current context it just constitutes another disguised topline disbursement to full members.This is effectively how FIFA functions and even though theyre hopelessly corrupt and a substantial portion of FIFA development money is effectively just voteshopping in the cheapest countries the effect is still evident.,Cricket,cw02zhh,2,t5_2qhe0

Go back to Cricinfo is my favourite retort doled out to desi fans. However this thread is a great example of how insidious that mentality can get. The user whos been so upset about this sub started out by calling Pakistanis cheaters despite the last five years having seen his team do all the alleged cheating. He then spends the entire time claiming that hes sick of Pakistani fans and works hard at trying to prove that all of them were trying to use the race card.As someone pointed out accusations of racism were downvoted faster than he could bitch about them. The rest made proper points which he didnt agree with so he started to whine.I hope the sub does pay attention to this thread and realises that kneejerk reactions to desi fans being like an Indian FB page are bullshit. And to the mods if Rule no.  is violated when someone uses the term wanker then I would request you police this sub more judiciously since youll find it violated more often. ,Cricket,cwd5ais,3,t5_2qhe0

5556460,0,t3_3r8gqh,I dont think that bowlers today are worse than those from the past. I believe its down to mainly technology  better technology has meant that batsmen can analysis fast bowlers or spinners on video replay which means bowlers cant hide different deliveries prime example is dernbach and his slower deliveries. Bowling machines have improved where some bowl act exactly like how professionals do so batsmen can get used to these bowlers in the net without facing them and hence in games these bowlers have little impact. Batsmen can analysis their own technique and hence improve it. Hence it could be said these modern bowlers have a tougher job at getting batsmen out with improvements in technology.,Cricket,cwltw1y,9,t5_2qhe0

5798088,0,t1_cxfsxj0,Im really suspicious that they showed them RTS and hawkeye for the wrong ball because the RTS didnt seem to match up with what was happening it would have shown it hitting his shoulder and Im pretty much certain that they showed an entirely different ball on ball tracking. To be completely honest if theyd given him what they want and had themselves organised that should have taken  seconds of them going yep hotspot spike on RTS but instead they gave the third umpire a complete mess. Im not surprised looking at that with the result. From the ground we had no idea what was going on there it was just taking forever and it felt like they were just pulling different views out of a hat. ,Cricket,cxft3gc,18,t5_2qhe0
5799692,0,t3_3ukfbw,Lets make the margin required for umpires call the same as the actual uncertainty of the system in question less than  what the ICCDRS claim it is. You dont lose a review for umpires call. Umpires Nigel Llong are banned from the game or have to complete remedial officiating courses Nigel Llong for obviously blown calls Nigel Llong like the ones that are so obvious Nigel Llong to the point where a nonparanoid person begins to think the umpire Nigel Llong was paid off Im talking about Nigel Llong. Not to call out a specific umpire or anything. Edit Oh! And if the umpire on the field has clearly shanked one Was it Ravi with the McCullum decision? but there arent any reviews left especially if both reviews were lost to umpires call like the Why didnt Broad walk? music video the third umpire needs to be able to call down to the field and say Back the fuck up thats totally wrong. Off you goreturn to the crease mate. Like I realize its sacrilege to praise gridiron football on this sub but holy fuck at least they make sure they get the damn calls right. Something looks questionable it gets reviewed. Automatically for something that clearly affects the game scoring plays and turnovers are the big two. Some of them still get missed by the TMO but those are the very marginal ones where theres only like one semiclear angle not the ones where the TMO has seen clear evidence and has just decided fuck it. ,Cricket,cxg09de,1,t5_2qhe0

Obviously.Or do you mean that he was instructed to ignore the hotspot? And that snicko didnt show the ball bouncing and the ball hitting Lyons shoulder? And the deviation? And being shown the wrong delivery for LBW? Was he instructed to deny the obvious conclusion if ANY piece of evidence could be called inconclusive?gt On review when I got a good chance to see it I thought it should be out too but it was lacking the key piece of evidence.

But if snicko shows you nothing then and this is the part that went wrong assuming theres nothing going wrong with the technology generally it means there was no contact.I have no idea what you are arguing here. Hotspot less reliable based on what? Neither system is  reliable. If they were there would be no need for the second method to be employed. There is no justification to rely solely on snicko.

As in an actual formal rule that Hotspot will always override RTS?

5822562,0,t3_3uxown,This is pretty much what I wrote about a day ago about the conditioning and culture towards fast bowlers...gt IMO I feel theres this slight bias in cricketing culture against spin bowlers. If a paceman takes a  wicket haul on a seaming pitch nothing out of the ordinary. But if a spinner does the same in a dustbowl somehow people feel robbed and hard done by and therefore more likely to talk about the pitch. There is this unspoken opinion in the cricketing world that pacemen are more superior and venerated than the right arm orthodox bowling his offies.But then again if we think about it this wayIf pitches are prepared to be pace friendly for  days then deteriorate to be spin friendly for  days it would be good because fast bowlers get something out of it early and spin bowlers get something out of it late.But if the pitch is spin friendly from day  you pretty much dont give pure fast bowlers a chance for the whole test match.,Cricket,cxiv2q7,6,t5_2qhe0

5919202,0,t3_3wd8k8,The neighborhood kid had a talk with THE kid last week about playing a set of games in the park where the chicks walk around. THE kid said yeah sure why the hell not!  THE kid now a day before the game says he does not want to play in that park because there is a chance that the chicks are hookers and he could get aids by looking at them so they instead quite coolly says lets play in my bedroom.     The neighborhood kid is pissed and refuses. THE kid says OK lets play in that park down south.  At this point the Parents of THE Kid come in and say why the fuck are you guys playing in Summer when there are kids fainting every hour due to the heat. Shut the hell up and sit inside.   THE Kids still want to play but are acting like the heat is too bad to play now in front of their stupid parents while sending secret Morse codes to each other about playing some quick hankypanky cricket in the night.   At this point no one knows if the Neighborhood Kid is even OK with playing in the South Park as he has flaunted to all his friends about playing in the chick park and will lose face.  ,Cricket,cxvjesg,-1,t5_2qhe0

5941104,0,t3_3wqq4l,Two factors that havent been mentioned so far that may have had an influence was the development of World Series cricket as well as the expansion of other sports into national competitions. World Series cricket started in  falling into around the time where a lot of the great cricketers from the s and s were growing up. World cricket perhaps lead to a brief spike in cricket participation and this would have increased the number of quality players coming through the system.The late s and s were a period of expansion in other codes. Growing AFL into a national game with an increased number of team would have certainly led to a decline in the number of standout junior players pursuing cricket as a theres a greater chance of competing at the highest level in the afl b in all likelihood better money and crowds and c a lot of footballers growing up are also talented cricketers recently Mitch Marsh Alex Keath and Stephen Cognilio are players who have had to make a choice between the two sports.

The seam should run across your fingertips and along your thumb.As youre delivering while youre turning your wrist rip the two gripping fingers backwards as though youre bowling a seamer.The ball will slow and sit up off the pitch but still turn.

6209268,1,t3_40lx41,gtIm guessing greater than  of Indian fans want DRS. If this isnt true we can discuss DRS in a separate thread.There is no evidence to claim this. DRS in its present form is controversial and a gimmick. Why dont other countries agree on a solid version of DRS and remove the controversial part. In my view DRS should consist of the following. No Ball tracking after pitching. Only look for the trajectory till pitching to see where it pitched. So for LBW decisions only whether it pitched in line or outside leg stump. Rest on field umpires decision. Prediction after pitching has a lot of errors and is far from accurate for using as decision making. Use hot spot for detecting edges for caught or LBW. Slow motion camera and snikco in sync.Now comes the most important part of it the cost. You must be knowing that in series between poor boards SLBD etc a very watered down version of DRS is used which is wrong. If it is going to be used then same DRS standard should be there in all international matches. Most boards will be unwilling to support the cost while BCCI will have least problems with it.Petitioners or Cricinfo are not going to bear the cost of DRS. And it is not as simple  as BCCI has money why dont they use it for DRS. Its not a one time investment. TV broadcasting contracts have to be renegotiated as why would the BCCI pay from its own pocket.Also its a well known fact the TV contracts involving India bring real money that is why every board is after a series with Indian team. England and AUS boards are rich but not other boards.In a nutshell BCCI are evil in other areas but here they have a point. Dont be naive in dismissing it simply.,Cricket,cyvfdi2,4,t5_2qhe0

Red is synonymous with TampT. Most of our flag is red and the first class team and t team before franchise cricket came along was given the nickname the Red Force. Calling it Red Steel retained some sense of nationality after so many of our local players were distributed to other franchises which itself left a  lot of fans feeling disconnected from the team.

7210329,0,t3_4duho7, If you think you are hitting too much on the leg side of the field then I guess something is wrong with your bottom hand grip. A tight bottom hand grip is possibly the reason why you are hitting most of the balls on the legside. I would recommend to loosen your bottom hand grip and tighten the upperhand grip to be able to play on both the sides of wicket.   To stay at the crease longer you must first learn to build an innings. By that I mean you must not try to whack every ball instead you must learn watch the ball closely and try to middle the ball in the bat. Once you start middiling the ball in the bat try to hit the ball in the gaps to take ones and twos. And in doing all these you might get a few easy balls to hitevery bowler bowls a loose ball at some point try to make the most of it.  I missed the most important advice of batting try to come in the line of ball and then hit it. It is because the closer you are to the ball more likely you are to make a good contact.  One last point try to move you feet as much as you can while batting. By that I mean try to go either on backfoot or frontfoot depending on the length the bowler bowls to you. A shorter ball is to be played from the backfoot and a fuller ball is to player from the frontfoot. This would help you maximize the yield of your shots.EDIT Added two extra points after the first two points.,Cricket,d1xrauh,1,t5_2qhe0

And then there was neil mckenzie who tied his bat on the ceiling after he did it once and scored a hundred. And putting toilet seats down and telling others where to sit too apparently  .

8647984,0,t3_4yc46t,OK can someone please explain to me the logic of Kohlis captaincy?He claims that he pursues an aggressive brand of cricket hence the need to prefer players who can change the course of a test match in a session. Thats given as the stated reason to prefer Rohit Sharma over Pujara and the long rope given to Dhawan which was horribly harsh and unjust on Vijay in my opinion as he has been our best test batsmen over the last couple of years. To fit Rohit in the team Kohli had to juggle the batting order and push himself up to . However given his susceptibility to the new red ball which was wonderfully highlighted by James Anderson he failed in the last test match which probably indicated that he does not have the technique for that position at least in test cricket. Now in this test match he has dropped Jadeja to accommodate an extra batsman. This way he ensures that Rohit Sharma plays and plays at the relatively safe position of .  He Kohli does not have to bat at .  We get Pujara at  and looks like this will be the last chance for him I dont think thats fair but at least his destiny is in his own hands for now. However what happened to aggressive cricket? What about the need to play five bowlers to ensure that we can get  wickets? Is it really that fucking important to play Rohit Sharma? That too in a match threatened by rain where we need to wrap up the opposition quicker to ensure that we win the test and retain the  ranking? ,Cricket,d6mlyon,10,t5_2qhe0

If we are gonna half ass the keeping at least half ass it with a decent batsman.Nayan Mongia was one of those half decent ones who was at least good when keeping for spinners could hold a bat if theres a proper batsman read Sachin at the other end and could swing his bat before eventually giving a lollipop to the fielders or run himself out.

Bangladesh no doubt lost confidence in the bowling department from the absence of Mustafizur whos individual contribution often drives the other bowlers to perform. The outcome however is a result of a lack of international games for Bangladesh. Winning still isnt routine business for them as it seems and things are blown out of proportion by the players in certain match situations and the fans.

9294952,0,t1_d8u6tec,Walking is great and  miles is a fair ton. I do occasional runs I really hate running frankly and I find that using a tracking app Runkeeper and Strava are  really good ones keep me motivated and engaged. Strava will map your walks and tell you who else is walking the same routes. Im not sure how big it is in Australia its pretty big here in the states Seeing a nice big map of where you went and what path you took goes a long way in keeping you going.Combining the walks with some gentle lunges can get you burning a lot of calories but go slow on that if youve never done lungessquats before leg soreness is no joke.I went down the route of skipping carbs altogether. That is a kind of a keto diet. I remember Id skip the rice and rotis indian bread completely and just eat the vegetables curries etc. Even if I got a chicken sandwich Id mostly skip on the bread part and eat the meat  veggies Id chuck the bread to birds. While this will work and you will lose weight I found myself being perpetually hungry and unhappy.I switched to not skipping carbs at breakfast eating a moderate amount of carbs on lunch and none at dinner. I found that I stayed fairly lean and it helped me gain muscle. Even if gaining muscle is not your goal you need some amount of carbs in your diet.Another time for carbs is after your long walk within  mins of it. The body is spent at that point and it needs its energy and carbs. Do not skip on carbs then. This is even more important for people who lift weights. Skipping on carbs after a workout will mean that your body will seek that energy from places it should not such as muscle. You will lose weight from the wrong areas and will become bony and skinny in the wrong sense. It has happened to me. I have seen my hard worked biceps decrease in width around the elbow region day by day and been able to do nothing about it.Breakfast can be your cheat meal because that is the meal that is supposed to be your heaviest which many dont realize. That is where you can go for your big bowl of oatmeal with almond butter mixed in and a generous sprinkling of sunflower seeds chia seeds and blueberries. Blueberries are one of the best things to eat they reduce inflammation and a shit ton of other benefits and theyre great to munch on.A heavy breakfast doesnt mean sugary waffles and syrupy pancakes though. Unnecessary sugar will accumulate. No bagels either thats too much bread. Go for toast with feta cheese butter etc.Want a sugar fix for breakfast? What I do is eat pancakes made of bananas honey and oatmeal. The natural sugar of fruit and honey combines to make it a delicious healthy breakfast. I can dig out the recipe if you want. For dinner its gotta be light and  or more hours before you go to sleep. I have lentil soups a staple indian meal called daal or curries and veggies. E.g. theres this excellent tofucauliflower spicy mix I make. Grilled chickensalmon works great and so easy to make. Just sautee on a pan with spices. Many options.

Even in the tour to England Moeen had decent therefore much better than expected record outing against India. I think the spin coach would not be without a few plans against Indians. Finally India batting lineup like that of any other current test playing teams can be prised open by spin bowling given thorough planning and precise application. I remember how Swann and Panesar could bring the same effect as Murali and Mendis a pair that I would rate higher in tests in the last victorious tour to India.

9756157,0,t3_5evvgy,Nevill had a good long run at the position and didnt do anything worth being kept.  Test average of  over  matches   innings.  He was good with the gloves but not enough to make up for his poor batting.  If Wades glovework is up to a better standard now then I reckon give him a year or so this Australian summer plus winter tours to see if hes a better longterm option and if that doesnt work then maybe it will be time for someone like Sam Whiteman.   Theres not really anyone else knocking down the door at WK as far as I know.Otherwise Im happy with Handscomb and Renshaw slightly confused about Maddinson but lets not forget that the selectors saw Smith as the batsman of the future while we were all still circlejerking his legspin.As for bowlers its a steep drop off after Starc and Hazlewood for that rd pace position.

MI leads in scouting as rayudu Saurabh Tiwari bumrah pandya Axar manish rahane dhawal Dhawan chahal were all uncapped when Mumbai Indians picked them but later went on to represent the national team or are knocking on the door bumrah and pandya are the result of indepth scouting.Even currently they have players like krunal and Nitish Rana who may make it to the national team with one good season.Then comes CSK. Vijay Dhoni Raina Ashwin Jadeja even Nehra for a year. Thats the base of the Indian team right there. Saying that these players playing together didnt help the national team would be idiocy.Next parameter is giving chances to the youngsters. Rajasthan wins here hands down.

10379440,0,t3_5olfcm,Captaincy is one of those catchall Im angry at something and I dont know what things in commentary. Sometimes things just arent going right and people will question just about any move a captain does. We all saw it with Misbah over the summer yet the bigger problems werent their plans and decision making but rather Yasir being ineffective and the fielders being unable to hold onto catches. The fact that theres been so much criticism of Smith over the summer when theyve won  out of  matches against two of the best sides in Test cricket at the moment is telling in and of itself. Having a crack at the captain even calling for a change in captain though is a very English move. I think part of the problem is that in commentary there is sometimes a lot of talk of what they would do. When this isnt done and things dont go ideally this quickly becomes what they should have done. Whether or not such differences in tactics would have helped however are never clear. ,Cricket,dckknrl,5,t5_2qhe0

So the rest of the top  runscoring batsmen in the world over that time were collectively averaging  while Jones was averaging .So Jones was the undisputed number one batsman in the world over a sixyear period.In that time he was without doubt one of the best three ODI cricketers in the world.Was there a continuous sixyear period where Yuvraj was one of the best  ODI players in the world?As for World Cups Jones was sensational in Australias  World Cup win averaging  with the bat and backed that up by averaging just under  in his other World Cup appearance in .,Cricket,dcp2edb,1,t5_2qhe0

10928621,0,t1_de76i09,gtBut of course okeefe gets more wickets when they play together. He doesnt do as much with the ball therefore batsmen are more inclined to try to play shots off his bowling. If youll note aswell most of his wickets this test were off balls where the batsmen played for spin that wasnt there. Most probably because the over before Nathan Lyon was turning it ft. My point they are a great partnership no matter who gets the spoils. Whilst this is a lovely hypothesis where it falls down is the following. Steve OKeefes numbers are just as impressive when theyre not bowling together Below are their numbers in games that they arent playing together|Match|Inns|Bat Ave.|Overs|Wickets|Bowl Ave|SR|Econ||||||||SNJ OKeefe|||.|.||.|.|.NM Lyon|||.|.||.|.|.Your hypothesis that OKeefes success comes from their partnership doesnt seem to hold water. Them together does seem them slightly more impressive than their overall FC records however this could come from a number of things including them . being more experience . just different conditions . sample size etc. The difference isnt enough to be writing home about. Interestingly Lyons actually performed worse with OKeefe in the team as compared to normal in Tests though. Lyons average . in his  Tests along OKeefe and . otherwise. This again could just be down to sample size the conditions or other such effects. The clear point in this though is that OKeefe is a very effective bowler but that gets us onto point . Control is vastly underrated by Australian audiencesWe heard exactly the same thing about Australians missing the straight ones in the first innings and in Sri Lanka yet when it was happening to the Indian batting lineup rather than praising the work youve gone back to that idea. I dont get why we as a country have lost that element about spin bowling its not something we care for. Nothing quite speaks to this more than how much we underestimate Herath at times though despite him being one of the few foreign spinners to find some success in Australia. I get that getting wicked sick rip on the ball is fun and all but proper spin bowling requires more subtly and control. Theres no doubt that Lyon can get revs on the ball but thats not always whats needed. Dont get me wrong bowling in partnerships is important and Im sure the amount of turn Lyon was getting had an impact on Indian mindsets but he still wasnt getting his line or length quite right in the second innings. The revs he was getting on the ball was getting something out of the pitch but the lack of control still took away from that. He did create good chance though. It just about sums Lyon up though he can bowl some great balls but he doesnt quite have that top level control. gtPlease stop making this a contest between the two. You cant honestly as a cricket fan say that Nathan Lyon isnt one of the best off spinners in the world and the best Aus have produced. He should always be the first spinner picked for Aus. Hes Australias best ever offspinner by wickets taken. However the numbers have been making a compelling case for a while and OKeefe is finally getting the chances to prove it in the Test arena he is a more effective spinner and given his impressive batting in FC cricket there is more than a strong argument for him to be first choice here on. This match wasnt a one off it just highlighted something most around the domestic scene had already known OKeefe is astonishingly effective. gtAgain nothing against okeefe he bowled incredibly and deserves his selection this test and I dare say the next  tests. He also deserves this stellar performance because he seems like a good honest cricketer and good bloke. Again its more than just one stellar performance. Above you can see in the OP  performances worth of data showing OKeefe constantly outperforming Lyon  of which werent this game and a data set of  showing the same difference in performance without this one included. Equally you can see another dataset where they arent together demonstrating that its not just their great teamwork. Hes been performing well for years and doing so in Australian conditions and when given the chance elsewhere for example the Australia A tour a few years back. gtBut this wild goose chase against Warne and now people turning it into some sort of Lyon v okeefe thing is just stupid. One game is one game fellas. Lets all just calm down after a great game shall we.Its not a wild goose chase against Warne if anything its been bizarre and quite frankly childish attacks against OKeefe for Warne all summer through to now and for absolutely no reason. The thing is this performance has laid that bare for all to see and now Warne is having to backtrack. Even then he spent half his time in the box trying to put the performance down to the pitch rather than just saying maybe his insane FC numbers were actually indicative of some ability great work selectors. Its worth noting that I quite like Lyon I just dont think his selection is justified anymore. If OKeefe wasnt on the scene his position should be safe as houses but he is and hes proving to be a much better player in most respects. As much as I love Lyon its pretty clear that if we go back to  spinner in the summer and its almost certain we will hell be the one to make one. ,Cricket,de77l9f,7,t5_2qhe0

And then Punter his arrogance and his overall attitude on the field where he believed that Oz cricket team was bigger than the game or other teams. Then the  series and Pup and Punter incidents on that tour compounded with Steve Bucknors blatantly biased umpiring turned all emotions for the Oz Cricket Team that I had into pure hatred. Pup being the next captain didnt help matters either.Being an Indian I obviously didnt enjoy India losing the home series in  to the Australians but a tiny part of me was and is still happy that Gilly was the captain who won the Final Frontier. The best bloke in that team in the last  years or so.Australian players from the last  years I still like Binga Martyn Haydos Gillyof course Langer and Tubbs.

11073500,0,t1_den4qmp,So a knowing violation of a rule by Smith does not meet the standard for you re  bringing the game into disrepute even though he was caught while doing it and there is no ambiguity.   But VK answering a question at a press conference given that there is one proven instance DRS violation Smith  VK expressing his personal narrative that he saw other instances and reported his concerns to the umpires  as is proper  this somehow merits a suspension even though there are no explicit rules regarding press conferences or allegations.    Going strictly by how you approach the question of Smiths punishment there is simply no basis for any action on VK  regardless whether his claims have merit or not.  I hate that this turns into an Indians vs Australians thing.  We are all cricket fans first  and what Smith did is extremely unfortunate and bad for the game.  You cant have teams and captains trying to knowingly cheat and then resort to legal defenses regarding whether the rules permit further punishment or not.  And thats without even considering the possibility of a greater systematic effort at cheating.  On top of that Smith didnt even man up  he throws his junior teammate under the bus.   And doesnt stop there  throws Marsh under the bus too for his nonreview.  Just an overall bad day for Steve Smith.  And liable to get much worse if the voracious Indian media manage to find further video evidence of dressing room signaling.  ,Cricket,den667l,12,t5_2qhe0

On the other hand when OKeefe loops it up in the    kmph range the ball is taking decent turn and beating the bat. The amount of lateral deviation depends on the revolutions you give and a slower delivery means more energy is dedicated to imparting revolutions on the ball more of which are needed on a less spinning pitch. ,Cricket,df4iwvx,6,t5_2qhe0

Kohli needed to put them off their game do something to ensure that their concentration was broken..otherwise they could havewould have steamrolled us. It is also instructive that whenever someone has taken his bait Smith in the last match Maxwell today theyve lost their wickets quickly.

It was clarke moving the game along that kept you guys in the match. I would never look at a game where Australia took  wickets for the match as a game we should have won. Clarke gave you that declaration because it is hard to bat on a day  wicket for  overs in a test match at  runs an over without losing wickets and he was proven correct. If you look at the match seriously australia was by far the better team. India gave themselves half a chance with an excellent partnership between kohli and vijay but besides that i dont think there was a single partnership over  in the indian th innings Also when saha got out i think you guys needed to score at over  runs an over which is easier said than done in a test match.Edit Some of my numbers are wrong.

11552053,0,t1_dg5d3ht,gt while he took us to the fucking sewer in ODIsWe had no proper batsman and bowler when he was captain. We were basically winning games if Ajmal took wickets. Thats not his fault. And we fell to  during Azhars captaincy. Hus captaincy in the World Cup  was pretty good its just our team was really bad with lots of injured players. The South Africa game we shouldve lost but we got all  wickets. Sure you can give credit to the fast bowlers for bowling really well but dont discount Misbahs captaincy and field placements. Same with the Australia quarter final the Clarke wicket was because of field placement.gt I remember that T game where we needed like a run a ball odd with  wickets in hand and Misbah was at the crease. Ended up as  from the last ball and I believe he got bowled. Summed his LOI prowess nicely.That was the last T match of the series with England in Dubai. Yea okay I agree he didnt play well there. But why are you expecting him to play really good every single game. No player can do that. No point in selecting very specific innings to prove your point. And just to mention that was his last TI game he didnt ask or beg to be picked again in the format. He understood and left the format to focus on Tests and ODIs. Thats not something you can say to other Pakistani players.gt Prolong the suffering at that pointReally??? Playing to save a game is prolonging suffering? Im not a stats guy and cant dig out specific games where his batting saved a match. And you can to UNDERSTAND there are  other batsmen on the team. If Misbah comes up the order to bat at  lets supposed he gets out playing non tuk tuk cricket a batting collapse following then the headlines come the following day Misbah is incompetent at cricket and was being selfish promoting himself up the order. The players who are suppose to open or play at  down are supposed to do their jobs. Its a Team game. And also realize that lots of Pakistani players are VERY picky about their spots in the team. They literally cry to get their spots case in point U Akmal. Also recently Hafeez coming to bat at  in the nd ODI when being the senior player he shouldve realized that Babar should be playing at . But no Im Mohammad Hafeez and Im not batting if its not opening or  down. Misbah being the person he is basically agrees to whatever spot everyone wants. Add to this that the team management the coach the batting coach also have a say in the batting order. Lets suppose Misbah didnt want to come up the order shouldnt they have stepped in and said go up the order. There are multiple factors cant just put the blame on  man.gt game he failed to close outThere was no game to close out. He created the game out of no where. Its a sport there are good day and bad days one team wins and the other loses. He doesnt have to win every single game. Like I said Misbah isnt a Dhoni or a Kohli or a Afridi superstar. His achievements are underrated. Sure he couldnt get a century but he did get the most s in a calendar year. Doesnt that count for consistency. Something all the other batsmen fail to accomplish.gt Same for the victories  may I add that I can remember more games that Hafeez Shehzad and Akmal have won with leading contributions than Misbah has?Todays game is an example. Hafeez scored a crucial odd runs that no one is really going to remember. Why? Because Malik scored a century scored the winning runs won the game with a six won the man of the match and the man of the series. IMO we won the game because of Hafeezs innings. Same can be said for Misbah you dont remember any game he won us because he didnt score a century. There a multiple games where he  score saved a batting collapse that a Afridi cameo won the game. People only remember the Afridi cameo. Like I said Im not a stats guy that can dig up games for references.gt I maintain he should have absolutely retired after the nd test in AustraliaGood on him to finish out the series. People wouldve FOR SURE called him a coward for retiring after the nd test. Sure we lost the test man up and go try to win the next game. Misbah has its own way of captaining the game. No one really agrees with it. People like Jarrod Kimber have also said that his field position and captaincy doesnt make sense but its Misbah team and he does whatever works for him not an actual quote but thats basically what he said. I also dont entirely agree with him going to WI as captain. I wouldve liked to see him go as a batsmen and give the captaincy to Sarfraz and basically help transition the team. But whatever the guy has done so much for Pakistan cricket let him have his  series. Let him try to end on a high note. Forget his LOI cricket just for his contributions to Test cricket let him leave on his own term. He deserves it after take a literally broken team Afridi quitting midseries then the spot fixing stuff to reach the top.He isnt asking for much. He doesnt deserve a press release retirement. ,Cricket,dg5ffv9,7,t5_2qhe0
