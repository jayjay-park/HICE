549349,0,t1_cg2ks0t,Is Narrative Design the specific position where world building takes place or would there be a position I should take more interest in as opposed to Narative Design that would veer more into the department of building mythos?Ive read that some teams hire writers from outside of the company to fill gaps in plotting or help the team I assume the same principle is used when attempting to construct universes?I apologize if Im coming off the wrong way and asking too many questions. There are few things I find myself passionate about and I kind of revere your position as a dream job and would love to have as much knowledge possible on the ins and outs of the job. Do you guys do ride alongs? Joking,narrativedesign,cg2pty3,1,t5_2y7z7
