3465336,0,t3_2zxsic,gtWhy does the EUparlement consider TTIP a good thing if it lets companies take money from countries through a biased foreign judge What biased foreign judge? If you mean ISDS the whole point is that you dont use national judges precisely because theyre likely to be biased  instead you use neutral arbitrators approved by people like the UN or the WTO. Each side picks one arbitrator and a third is chosen by mutual consent.gtif said countries have laws that dont allow the companies to sell their products because theyre considered to be harmful or unethical. If a product is considered to be harmful or unethical and cannot be sold in a country on that basis TTIP does not provide for companies to sue on such a basis.gtWhy are laws in nd world countries like America being considered viable even though our countries have much higher standards.Be serious. The US is clearly a first world country and its standards are often at least as good as ours. For many years their environmental standards were much higher than ours.,europeanparliament,cpn9ugo,27,t5_34528

Every citizen of these countries can be compared to Kosovo citizens if you want to consider overstay of  day visa. Its the same situation or maybe worse e.g. if you compare it to Bosnia.,europeanparliament,crokzjm,1,t5_34528

4427961,0,t3_3bh68p,gt I havent seen much press about this. And what I miss most wich parties are against or in favor. I want to know who to annoy on twitter. Sometimes they do respond.You may find this relevant then  the supposed EU rule is just a suggestion to an EP committeegtIn case youre wondering Jonathan Arnotts scaremongering claim was lets say inspired by a discussion that recently took place in the European Parliaments legal affairs committee. It does not relate to holiday snaps. Its about copyright over commercial images. And needless to say its not an EU law nor even a proposal for one. Parliament hasnt even voted. Its just one idea submitted as part of a general nonlegislative discussion about copyright which is a million miles from becoming law even if MEPs wanted it to.,europeanparliament,csou2q0,1,t5_34528

8175110,0,t1_d4z7b0h,I think according to the Treaty it just has to be twelve times a year and since theres no session in one of the summer months August? they double down in one of the autumn months. I think it should also be Brussels because the amount of people that have to go to Strasbourg is just way too high. But good luck getting France to agree to making Brussels the main seat... ,europeanparliament,d4zfsms,1,t5_34528
