4389929,0,t1_cskebhi,I agree with you on the fact that the engine is pretty old yet there is some sort of upside  Many computers can run this game and the users can still get a lot of fun. I played MTA for  years now... I met nice people which also have hardware capable of running  games but come back to GTA SA for the old feel.,mtasa,cskhbxe,1,t5_2w6va
