So if you are using WLAN or some WWAN connection that is a bit flakey it will show up in this kind of a way.The reason is that if and when Windows sends a network disconnected signal when the connection is renegotiated chrome assumes that it has gone offline and does the sensible thing and pauses all streamed playback.,google,cioo5n0,1,t5_2qh45

1751289,0,t1_cjzm01t,Getting offtopic I suppose but the cloud is still physical storage its just storage thats not in your control.  Thats good in a way because it means Googles responsible for keeping up with failing hard drives and other maintenance but unfortunately they dont guarantee that theyll do a good job.  Usually they do of course but if something bad happens youre on your own.What Im trying to say is that your photos will probably be in Googles cloud forever or at least as long as Google Photos exists but youd be a fool to rely on that.  If youve got any photos there you really care about you should have your own backup or two.Oh and to answer your question I keep my originals backed up at home with my own edits.  Those that I upload to Google always get the auto enhance treatment because its just one mouse click to revert and it usually makes them look really nice for sharing.  Then again I dont shoot anything with my cell phone so Im not dealing with auto backup.  My stuff gets edited by me before it gets uploaded.,google,cjzwpe0,1,t5_2qh45

It also works this way by scanning your email for flight receipts for the airport drives movie amp reservation receipts for the same etc. It also offers a lot of other convenient stuff. I have precise location always turned on on my phone and Google Now tells me when to leave for the places I hang out and go out to at the times I usually go there weekends for example and how long a bus ride to work would take and when the bus will be there every day. If I search for a location on Google Maps without asking a route for it Google Now will have a card that tells me how long itll take me to get there  and if I click it Ill start navigation there.

1899177,0,t1_ckhvqwl,Yeah Im not sure why the focus here is on gmail.  Google has everything tied up together and losing access to gmail while very bad has much bigger ramifications. Id much rather lose those tensofthousands of sales emails that are in my archive than I would access to Google Auth or Drive or Wallet or even my picasawebg photos.  Luckily you can take big steps to protect all that with twofactor auth as the author very briefly suggested.  As long as Google doesnt shit the bed theres no reason anyone whos so inclined cant protect their account.That said I think the authors real intention here was to point out that most of us do nothing to back up our gmail.  I have backups of my photos not nearly as well organized but I have them.  I have backups of my Drive filesdocuments.  I could rebuild my Wallet profile with some effort assuming its not hackedcompromised.  But if I woke up tomorrow with no access to my Google account I have no backups of my email archive.

People wont care how their phone knows they have woken up  just that if they say remind me when I wake up to take my pills that it will remind them.Plenty of people dont sleep with their phone by the bed. They plug it in to charge in the study or kitchen and grab it on the way out the door. Thats too late to give them a when I wake up reminder. Those reminders would typically have to be acted upon before leaving otherwise it would be a when I get to work or similar reminder.I would be ashamed to write software that failed for  of my users.

The more people that use it the better it is so unseating it from the top is nearly impossible. EDIT Obviously I didnt make my point very well...Google is improved by the people who use it. Its algorithm improves as more people search and click. So its massice popularity only makes it even better. This makes it hard to dethrone. I used Facebook as an example because most people use it to connect with people and the service with the most people is going to be best at that. Im not implying facebook is flawless.

A week after the report by McAfee Microsoft issued a fix for the issue and admitted that they had known about the security hole used since September.In Googles investigation of the hack they disclosed that they had identified  other companies that had been hacked too and that it appeared to be that the Chinese government had been trying to hack into the gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents.As a result of Microsofts lax handing of the security issue peoples lives were put in danger and a number of large US companies were hacked by the Chinese government.Googles current stance on security disclosure is well known.

3330727,0,t1_cp7wmd4,I agree with you on most of what you wrote. With Valve.  And I think Gabe wouldnt sell it unless he was running stuff and only reported to Larry Page. With Android it works great on low end hardware and will continue to get better as hardware gets better too.  But since Chrome OS came out in  with the main mass sellers of the Chromebooks eventually the netbooks as we know them today will be a lot better.With Dart it is on the roadmap  and with the large number of releases  I dont see why Google would continue it unless they were going to integrate it.  But we will learn soon enough particularly once Oilpan is integrated.  But anyone who writes code in Dart will have it automatically run on the other browsers for it is designed that way.  For Dart will automatically convert it to Javascript and often faster than most people natively writing Javascript code.On the Pixel  it makes zero sense to me on why Google would come out with a Chromebook that cost over a thousand dollars.  My guess is that they were going to do this awhile ago until Sundar took over.  Then he had them change to work on Wear TV and Auto.  However now that they did that I think they are going to come out with an Androidbook.,google,cp7xgz0,1,t5_2qh45

3384290,0,t3_2yxyx1,This only affected a very small segment of customers. When signing up for Google Apps you can purchase a domain if you dont already have one. This is not very common as most people that come to Google Apps already have any existing domain. Nonetheless during the domain creation procedure the users were given the opportunity to make their domain registration public or private. It appears the publicprivate option was ignored and all domains had public registrations.Its definitely an oversight and Im not making excused for Google but the worst thing that comes from this is spam. Since Google is one of the best in the business at filtering out spam especially since their acquisition of Postini its really a nonissue.

Camera is actually a little ahead of the Google camera Launcher still gets regular commits all the damn time Calendar got the new look and feel before Google calendar did. Dialer is nearly identical to the Google version but without the autolookup of phone numbers.I can keep going but i think the point is made.

The more you read the more you realize the importance of extreme vigilance when it comes to whats happening at whatever place you send your kids to for majority of their day. Quite often parents are simply left completely in the dark about some very important matters.One such example relates to Googles penetration of the U.S. public school system and how the company employs a loophole in order to collect data on children. Google achieves this by referring to itself as a school official under the law. I truly wish I was making this up.From the Washington PostGoogle is a major player in U.S. education. In fact in many public schools around the country its technically a school official. And that designation means parents may not get a chance to opt out of having information about their children shared with the online advertising giant.The combined allure of Googles free suite of productivity tools and cheap laptops that use the companys Webbased ChromeOS operating system have made Googles products a popular choice at schools around the country. And the companys growing dominance is raising concern from some privacy advocates who allege it is using some student data for its own benefit.Googles standard agreement for providing its education suite defines the company as a school official for the purpose of that student privacy law. In Googles case the company is providing software that districts might otherwise have to develop or support themselves such as email services or tools that help students digitally collaborate on assignments.But schools are supposed to have direct control of how a company or individual uses and maintains education records to deem them a school official according to the departments regulation. Khaliah Barnes an associate director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center or EPIC argues that isnt happening with many ed tech providers including Google.The schools dont have access to Googles servers or a lot of the way that it uses the information because it is proprietary she said. In  EPIC brought a lawsuit against the Education Department in an attempt to stop the government from interpreting the law in ways it argued could allow schools to share more data about students with less explicit consent but the case was later dismissed on standing grounds.Why am I not surprised in the least.Today Google and many other tech companies are increasingly part of students daily classroom lives under the school official designation. And that leaves parents in the dark about who has access to an increasingly large cache of information about their children and may compromise their privacy down the line experts say. But as previously reported Google said it has always been firmly committed to keeping student information private and secure.Private and secure ok but they are still collecting this data arent they? They are still essentially tracking the activity of little children without their consent or parental consent are they not?Even  years ago parents really didnt expect schools to track more than basic information about their childrens school performance  things like attendance and test scores. But the latest generation of educational tech products are cataloging a nearly limitless amount of data on what students do everyday  from emails and chats to metadata such as location history that educators may not even realize is being collected Barnes said.The companies themselves arent transparent and often times schools even arent aware of the extent of data collection Barnes said.School districts are just generally not providing notice to parents said Reidenberg.Youve been warned.,google,cyhmrpq,1,t5_2qh45

7088545,0,t1_d1jtk8g, Its mostly for businesses not for friends and family. I dont want to give my cell phone number to every person or business that needs to contact me especially if its a temporary relationship. Friends and family usually call my or my wifes cell phone.Ill give an example. My kids elementary school uses an automated call system to call and inform us of school events or snow days stuff like that. We get a call every couple days. We dont even pick up. We just let their system leave a message. The school uses our home phone number for that. We dont need them calling our cell phones for something like that. Weve had our landline number for  years so some places and people only have that number. I have one cell phone and sometimes its not even on the same floor as I am. I have a cordless landline VoIP on every floor of my house. Sometimes my cell phone is low on battery. The house phones are always charged and more reliable. I have  young kids that dont have cell phones. Id rather people not be calling my cell phone to talk to them. My wife runs her cell phones battery dead all the time. She also tends to destroy her phone. She needs people to be able to get ahold of her in those cases.Most young adults started their adult lives with a cell phone and have never needed anything else. My wife and I started our adult lives with only a landline cell phones were just starting to become popular and dont want to give it up.Contrary to how it sounds I am not some old dude who has a crappy flip phone. Ive just gotten used to having a house phone. If I was forced to give it up Id adjust quickly Im sure but its free so I stick with it.In summary I like having a number that rings our homefamily rather than me or my wife specifically.

7660942,0,t3_4k78c7,I had this applied to me yesterday to my surprise. While I can see some liking this I certainly didnt. Thankfully there is a couple work arounds. The first one being if you dont like this look just delete all your google cookies from your browser and youll see its back to normal.However I do expect this to become a permanent change as slow selective applying of new layouts before forcing it on everyone seems to be Googles favorite approach for this stuff. So therefore I have created a Stylish CSS that pretty much makes it appear like it used to. The only thing thats missing from this custom CSS are the borders. This is because Google has additional html elements they use to create the borders which are not present in this new layout. You cannot create html elements with CSS either so unless someone knows greasemonkey to get around that one its the closest I can make it.If anyones interested in this Stylish layout let me know and I will consider posting it for anyone who wants it. Im mainly waiting to see if this is going to become a permanent addition first.,google,d3d07qb,6,t5_2qh45

If youre concerned about your accounts security one failsafe solution is to change your password just make sure to change it to something youll remember.This might still be an issue for the new owner if you had Factory Reset Protection enabled on your device but there are ways around it I usually make sure that the android setup wizard is still accessible after factory resetting the phone.,google,ddl23ko,1,t5_2qh45
