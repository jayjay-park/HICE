240358,0,t3_1wulko,I took Germ  German Cinema in Context last semester and loved it. It takes care of core . and is a fun and easy  credit hours. If you have interest in film especially foreign film then I  recommend. The professor is great and so is the content of the course. Not once did I regret having to trek to Wescoe on a Thursday evening.,UniversityofKansas,cf5nxwc,2,t5_2rtc2

1716092,0,t3_2e0oip,Personally although the rec has a decent selection of stuffweightsetc I found that it was way too busy when I wanted to go generally fairly dirtysmelly to the point that I didnt want to really touch any of the machines and sometimes had issues with some of the patrons laughingogling and telling me things like how I shouldnt be taking up the weights during the busy times because the men needed them more.So I did some looking. A LOT of the gyms in town offer a substantial membership discount for students. I ended up at an all womens gym due to the price less than  cleanliness and availability of people that had experience working with injury recovery like mine. But it wasnt the only one with the discount.,UniversityofKansas,cjvh4xp,3,t5_2rtc2

2179272,0,t3_2jywxx,Ive taken about  classes at Barton bartonline.org that worked out well transferred straight to KU. I dont know how many transfer credits you have left you can check on your DPR but I would definitely look into it. Barton has made a lot of straight KU transfer classes on purpose that are super affordable and can be taken in full semester half semester summer and winter break sessions.  per credit hour I think. Most popular ones are Western Civ  Bio  Gen Chem  labs included! Physics  labs included! I did this! Math  Spanish ... it goes on. Im a Bio major so hit me up if you want advice on CLAS transfers. Edit only problem is you cant get JrSr hours for community college transfers but if youre like me trying to get some of the bothersome gen eds OR electives out of the way that are still in the  level doing them online was super nice.,UniversityofKansas,clgu6wu,2,t5_2rtc2

6700834,0,t1_cxzz5az,Interesting  and this is a bit old  to read Calebs written account of how all of this happened. Its full of the usual nonsense and is difficult to read. However what I found interesting was comparing the students language about their perceptions of their own safety and how they felt unsafe and how Caleb totally invalidates any safety concerns the dean may have had during this confrontation. Apparently perceptions only matter if you are on the correct side and not problematic.,UniversityofKansas,d0cfa9q,1,t5_2rtc2
6791892,0,t1_d0m0nlp,Yes and no. Yes this guy resigned and yes that is a shortterm gain for them. In the long run though do you really think the next person in line will make them any happier? Probably not. Even if the next person somehow complies with their list of demands theyll somehow screw up on the next problematic issue or perhaps not get things done quickly enough. Who knows? The key to being a professionally upset person is to constantly be upset. Eventually someone is going to get tired of their nonsense and act. In the meantime I know for a fact that people are changing how they endow money to KU because of this mess. Who knows how it will change enrollment but similar protests havent helped at MU.I do find it a bit amusing that the nonstudent who screamed at the former dean is now  banned from the building. He should be of course but these same people are turning it into racism with rhetorical questions like would a white person be banned from the school? Well yeah. Ive never actually seen another situation similar to the video of the former student menacing a dean but Im pretty certain if a white nonstudent tried to bully a dean at the school theyd be banned too. But you know.... racism.,UniversityofKansas,d0m5egy,3,t5_2rtc2

8830114,0,t3_514ga1,Its all about whos paying for your school and where they pay taxes. My dad paid out of state tuition for me my first  semesters at KU Im from KCMO. It wasnt until my dad himself moved to KS and claimed his residency that I was allowed in state tuition. Theres a whole process to proving your residency too they will need W forms drivers licenses and some third proof of address if I remember correctly. The only way to get in state tuition at KU is if youre in the architecture program as there arent any specific programs for that in the state of MO if Im remembering correctly. Good luck and Rock Chalk! ,UniversityofKansas,d7998il,8,t5_2rtc2

11266194,0,t1_df8zkqm,Hmm. Its my understanding that with the scholarship halls you have several hours per week required to help out with cookingcleaning. And I thought that the meal plan was different too.Edit Im gonna take a second look at scholarship halls. KUs website doesnt have much information on how things work though so any info would be helpful. Im particularly curious on how the food plan works and the how the weekly chores are handled.,UniversityofKansas,df9092h,3,t5_2rtc2
