2043780,0,t3_2i6zhz,So you have to walk all your pieces across an entire x chessboard to reach an opponent even if youre opponent has made the same walk? Also he says he needs  colors but the pattern should mesh with only . Since every cell must have exactly  edge neighbors and  corner neighbors for chess moves to be valid each space and its  neighbors must be isomorphic with a x square grid and any square grid in Euclidean space can be filled with  colors without any adjacent squares matching. In fact in established player chess models the two color system is vital because it illustrates corner adjacency at the center of the board. You cant play without it. Even if you worked with a triangular grid and a special rule set anything but  colors breaks the readability of the game. Bipartite graphs motherfucker.It gets even worse when you see the big version at the end of the video where hes just drawn in a rightangled grid for the central triangle meaning it only meets up with the bottom square. The other two borders intersect an extra  or  squares so I guess you just decide which one youll hop onto when you get to the edge?Of course it ends with I dont really know where Im going with this but if you give me money Ill figure it out. Why would your backers want a clear vision and due dilligence research anyway? Why would anyone do a cursory wikipedia search for the thing they just invented?This is somehow more upsetting to me than the perpetual energy devices that actually get funded for thousands of dollars.

Last time I checked the Croissant Baguette Macaron and more have a French origin.  Heck walk into a common bakery such as Bread Talk in China or a Chinese McDonalds McCafe and youll see French style baked goods.  However how many Chinese style baked goods do you see elsewhere?Based on analysis of our comments alone if there is anyone more inclined to be ignorant or racist its you.  You saw the name FangYing Chang then said Im pretty sure she is not a native speaker  so someone with the name FangYing Chang cant be born and raised in the US and assumed to be a native speaker right? Im guessing you dont know that there are Canadians and US natives with Chinese names from families that have been in North America for generations who dont speak Chinese.  You do know that Chinese people came from China to North America to help build the Canadian railroad and contributed to US infrastructure way back in the s right?hahaha...really...cognitive dissonance in full effect right here my friend. ,shittykickstarters,csowe1g,1,t5_2vpan

You just cannot compete in that market without using modern materials and doing some serious research.People who buy your backpacks will do so for fashion or lifestyle reasons. Thats your selling point. I wouldnt want to use any of them for a hiking trip because they appear to be heavy and really not made for carrying weight for longer periods of time.I wouldnt use them in the city either because Im not a hipster but I know a ton of people who would. ,shittykickstarters,cx17gyb,3,t5_2vpan

5731763,0,t1_cx5znh4,Seems there is no provision for a Plan B incase its original plan didnt go as planned. Everything else aside the fact that they used only one supplier for the blender component  with said suppliers workers now on strike  smacks of poor planning. That doesnt bode well at all for Coolest considering oneman shops like this guy had their Plan Bs laid out in advancegt The greatest strength of my project is also one of its greatest challenges. The main component of the bags rely on using recycled materials. As I have said I have  local bike shops saving tubes for me and weekly I collect them then clean and process them so that they are ready to be sewn.gt The supply of used inner tubes is seasonal lots of them in the spring and summer and not many at all in the winter. I have been stockpiling them for months and have more than enough on hand to complete all the bags I need for the project goal in the time stated. There is always the real possibility if it gets funded a lot past my goal though that I will run out of tubes and not have enough used ones on hand and no reliable way to get more locally until spring.gt If this does happen I have other options to obtain raw materials. I have found a supply of old stock new tubes that I could purchase at a reasonable price and also am in the process of setting up a supply line to receive used tubes from other bike shops in an area with a more year round riding climate. I am confident that I will be able to obtain all the tubes I need to fulfill the project even if it greatly exceeds the goal.gt I plan on doing all the cleaning cutting and sewing myself but if the project goal is exceeded by a large amount I will bring in extra help to process materials and free myself up for extra sewing as necessary.,shittykickstarters,cx7kxwv,3,t5_2vpan

This is my first kickstarter and my second game I made on my own... Right now I have no job but I wanted to see if I can make game development a full time thing. The kickstarter money is basically money for this months rent as I work on the game. Also  hopefully a tool for marketing and getting the game out there  since like uccricers pointed out  The mobile game scene is pretty brutal to break into.

8103829,0,t1_d4oea6g,So Im studying Biochem and that campaign and the patent are complete BS. The patent basically claims that by cutting meat in tiny pieces you somehow increase the shelf life of the product. Not only that but the meat is to be cut without ice allowing it to reach high temperatures. The claims behind that mechanism are completely ridiculous. . He claims the meat should be cut to pieces of the size  nm  . mm. That is completely impossible. An average single protein molecule has a size of  nm so in order to achieve  nm youd have to have a knife that is able to somehow destroy molecules consistently hint that doesnt exist.. He claims that the temperature increase you observe when cutting the meat is due to bonds in the proteins being broken or some magical mechanism that releases energy upon protein being exposed. Thats bullshit. Heat is simply a result of frictional resistance when breaking the muscle fibersgliding the blade through the already cut meat.. He claims that this process somehow increases shelve life. Thats bullshit. The reason why meat manufacturers use ice in the cutting process is to reduce the frictional heat and to keep it at temperatures that inhibit the growth of pathogens. With his method you dramatically increase the risk of spoiling the meat. As for the cancer part I hope everyone realizes that is completely baseless pseudoscience. Your test measurements and literature search are nice but there is no indication of electricity being of any importance in cancer development at all. Since you took the time researching and testing it I assume you took it somewhat seriously. So let me stress Whenever you read about bad energies vibrations or bioelectricity you should be fairly certain its utter bullshit because those are not concepts of molecular biology. With the exception of neuroscience bioelectricity matters virtually nowhere else macroscopically i.e. in no subject except neuroscience you will find effects measurable with something akin to a multimeter.,shittykickstarters,d4qxyxr,3,t5_2vpan

The complicated thing when you learn the language is learning all the metadata to your words like gender plus the rules you need to apply to adjust them to be put together.

9275786,0,t1_d8rn6yu,gtDesign is often the determining factor between two similar products i work in graphic design. Both the overall product design and the graphic design elements.Yes if youre an established company hiring or contracting qualified designers etc. This is an individual trying to sell their design to the masses. Its like if Bob came out with Bobs Cola and charged more than CocaCola or Pepsi. Yes Im sure researching and manufacturing cola is difficult but Bob is not an established Cola maker. And Bobs customers are actually investors that are assuming the risk that they might get no Cola. Which raises the question why would they pay more for the chance of getting Bobs cola than an actual can of CocaCola? Whats more she sells the PDF for  which means you can put an exact price on it and the rest of it is implied to be the manufacturing cost of the notebook.gtAlright find me at least  examples of this in australia. One that also has a document sleeve comes in a storage box and can be laid nearly completely flat. AND cheaper. And about cm thick overall. Kgo.Im not Australian I didnt consider the fact that the creator was Australian before posting and to be honest Im not sure its relevant because Kickstarter is an international platform and many of the backers probably are too. But the vast majority of planners you can get in shops online etc. cost less than  AU in other currencies.

Theyre actually relaunching a fixed version now though one wonders if it isnt just a way to avoid having to call it a failure. I like to root for the underdog but the Karma  didnt exactly sell like hotcakes when it was brand new and now that the Mavic is out and with a recall in its history to boot I dont really see it going places unless its really cheap or much better  and to be honest I doubt the latter is a real possibility Im not likely to buy a Mavic because Im not a fan of prepackaged nosharpcorners solutions but I cant deny that its a massively impressive piece of gear.,shittykickstarters,dc2lcgw,1,t5_2vpan

A  yearold owning an K house without any realworld experience or substantial work history unless you are a trust fund baby is a big red flag.Also being interested in this product I emailed the owner of Bakeys Narayana Peesapaty to find out whats happening.

11351013,0,t1_dfilajd,I basically agree with you but Ive come to feel that problem is that they actually arent hard to make. The mechanicals are easy to understand and cartesian motion is something many people learn in school.  Thats why so many of these crop of. People build one in their basement and they think they can take it to market. So while its not that difficult to make one  they are hard to make reliably at scale. People go in to these KS ventures with false confidence from having build a couple and then they almost always fail to account for the pitfalls of manufacturing anything at scale and the more complicated the more parts the more vendors the more likely they are to get in over their heads. ,shittykickstarters,dfim793,20,t5_2vpan
