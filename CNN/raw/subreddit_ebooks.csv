476568,0,t1_cfueptc,Theres an option in the Calibre conversion dialog under Page Settings that lets you select the output profile. For the input profile stick with generic at first but you could try kobo touch as an alternative option.Unfortunately theres no output profile for the Aura yet the Sony Reader T profile is the closest match to your resolution x alternatively the Tablet profile may also be worth trying out since it does not assume a fixed resolution. im not an expert on calibre conversionSigil is an ebook authoringediting tool.

1276343,0,t3_28om59,Unfortunately the same reason that ereaders have trouble with pdfs is the reason why converting them to other formats is troublesome too. The PDF format is all about page layout precisely placing a pile of letters in a particular pattern on the page. Whereas more robust formats like epub tag the text with information about what lines group together into a paragraph or what text is a header and then let the displaying program figure out how best to arrange it on the screen on a casebycase basis.You could try turing on heuristic processing when using calibre to convert pdfs to other formats that might help. It tells calibre to attempt to guess at the meaning of the text to take a stab at inserting paragraph breaks and whatnot. You can fiddle with the parameters a bit to help it make better guesses. Even if its not perfect itll probably do a better job than the ebook reader itself will manage. And you can touch it up by hand afterward.,ebooks,cid7fdl,1,t5_2qqfh

3128639,0,t3_2vz9tf,The Pocketbook Touch Lux  is generally reviewed very favourably and easily available here in Germany I tried it out at the local Saturn and really liked it. Good build quality though not quite as sturdy as the metalframed Kindle Touch I have. Cant afford it right now and am satisfied enough with my KT.. It fullfills all but two of your criteria see end of my post.It works with both EPUB including Adobe DRM and MOBI files too.Here is a deep link to the part of a German review talking about the rebindable! hardware buttons.Downsides It has a touch screen and whether there is an official mode or unofficial jailbreakmod for operating it with the physical buttons only I have no idea. It has a back light front light Though I cant fathom why you dont want one. The missing backlight is my number one grip with the KT as I in bed actually prefer to read on my smartphone because while its backlight shines in my face the room is still darker then when i use the bedside table lamp to read on my kindle which interferes with failing asleep.,ebooks,coma51u,3,t5_2qqfh

The light level is adjustable less harsh and it turns off when the nook goes to sleep so if you fall asleep reading the light isnt on all night.
