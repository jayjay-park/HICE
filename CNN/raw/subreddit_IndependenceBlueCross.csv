My sister who is  was driving the  Ford focus. It was not her fault. we were at a four way intersection and had a green light to go. Everyone was stopped besides our light going south ampthe other going north. An elderly woman on the right hand side who was going to turn crashed into my side. The passenger front as well as the back door. It is all crashed inward. We then hit a palm tree on the side of the road and landed on top of it. Some yellowgreen fluid leaked out. Us  passengers in the Ford taurus all went to get checked at the hospital. We are all fine. But now we have no idea what to do with this wrecked car that has now been towed. The Ford Taurus we were in only has liability insurance. how will the car be fixed or can it even get fixed? This car accident all took place in Avon park FL. The car we were in has Insurance from Michigan. Since that is where my father and his girlfriend purchased the car last year. The insurance ampeverything is under his girlfriends name. So Shes the one who said it only has liability insurance.,IndependenceBlueCross,d0yccx1,1,t5_30f12
