5777109,0,t3_3nm6k0,Great write up. Ill be giving this a watch. I agree with the writer that Hellbound and Bloodlines are the two best sequels. I understand Bloodlines theatrical cut is very flawed. It really goes all over the place and it is hard to focus and care about the various stories with it jumping around. The ideas for the story are great and the visuals alone made it a fun watch for me. I am an anthology fan and it is neat to see somewhat of an anthology Hellraiser film. Very comic book like as well.,hellraiser,cxd7du7,2,t5_2swwv

9274525,0,t1_d8riquq,That was purely a test for the cube am building a whole room currently working on the bloody mattress with chains.Have already made a room with other props now transposing it to hell and messing things up.  Starting with the mattress... This is the room in its current state  . THe window needs to be bigger or higher for a start. Will be smashing the lava lamp and generally ruining everything will have beams through the shutters. Current state of mattress build  Close up of cube  It has some depth if i put too much on it loses the wood colour in the shadows but ill keep working on it.,hellraiser,d8rm1na,3,t5_2swwv
