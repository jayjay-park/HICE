782885,0,t3_233adl,What books did you read and what videos did you watch? I do agree that a lot of the content is more easily absorbed if you have personal experience within each domain. Im not trying to toot my own horn or anything but I only studied  weeks and passed on the first try. My coworker studied for  months and failed twice before passing. He also has double the experience than I do. Some people are just better at taking tests than others. I would highly recommend using the Total Tester program that comes with the AllinOne Shon Harris book. Do those over and over again until you get  each time and then youll be readyIMO. I think those questions were the most realistic out of all of the practice tests I took. You can also tailor the test to your weak pointscertain domains like Networking. I also recommend Eric Conrads CISSP Study Guide.. his explanation of each domain was very easy to follow and remember. Good luck,cissp,cgt9nku,2,t5_2seif

2119322,0,t3_2hjaqf,The best advice I have got about the CISSP exam is to forget about the technical aspects of IT and shift gears to security management and polices etc. I know some very smart people much smarter than I who did not pass the test on the first try.

6200966,0,t3_40im2q,According to ISC you must meet the  year minimum experience in  of the  domains. You can have ONE year of experience waived if based on education or additional ISC certification.I think you will find it hard to get sponsored without the minimum experience requirement. The application actually requires that you document all of your experience to prove you have met the time and domain experience requirements.,cissp,cyuheyu,2,t5_2seif

6847366,0,t3_49gbwz,So say you have a site and youve established relationships with other sites so that you can work together to provide team solution. As an example Southwest airlines Alamo rent a car an Hilton hotels wanted to create a streamlined process for using their services.  Those three organizations create a federated identity between them. SPML would be the back end language that takes the account from one service and uses that to log into the other two. Another example you run a newspaper you want to have a real name policy for your commenters to limit shitposting. You could use Facebooks comment tools but you have a solution that you think works better for you. You could use a federated login with Facebook and have account data passed back to your forum applet via SPML.  ,cissp,d0sgf21,2,t5_2seif

8099480,0,t3_4q0963,Anyone who would laugh at you can F right off for asking these questions.  Everyone starts somewhere and progresses onward.As others have alluded to the tests you mentioned are apples to oranges comparisons of one another.  Network and CCNA are not the same category of test by any means despite their names.  And the SSCP and CISSP have no prerequisites other than the  year relevant experience statute.The answer to your questions depends on many things.  It sounds to me like youre doing a little bit of introspective cert shoppinginventory and thats okay.  I think everyone does.  The CISSP is one of the preeminent security certifications one can attain and is valid for DoD purposes for the highest categorization of cyberIA work as per the  google that its above scope here.  But that cert baseline in the  might be something youd be interested in giving a look at to see how the tiers of certification typically stratify.  ,cissp,d4qgdb3,1,t5_2seif
8315920,0,t1_d5gwwb6,I have about  years of actual hands on IT Work. I was formally trained but uncertified. I took a break for a few years to pursue what I thought where dreams elsewhere. Turns out I like IT better. A lot better. I have been passionate about computers since the s and want to make it my forever career specifically in security. Why am I rambling on? To answer your question I got my first real cert in Feb this year sec but have had my head in computers for couple of decades. When I study anything I go all in. Full immersion. So for the past year I have been watching Network Security and CISSP videos in that order in addition to a lot of reading and note card making. Probably a few thousand quizlet cards at this point. I am glad you find my aid helpful. More than anything I hope people learn the method to my madness and make it their own if it helps. I have done well academically for a long time since I learned to apply funny memory aids to all that I do. Heres another for order of PDUs on the OSI. Starting at the Transport layer down is SPFB.

Never tried transcender or Skillset but you will get those double negative Which of these is not a part of  questions in the test. This test for me was all about gut feeling.
