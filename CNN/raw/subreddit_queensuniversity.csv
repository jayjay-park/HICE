563283,0,t1_cg49ddh,OKAY! I DO THIS STUFF I CAN ANSWER!QMUN the one run through the AMS is kinda lame. It is for the beginners and only Queens students. The people organizing it dont have too much experience doing things and a lot of the people in QIAA either think it is a joke get asked to organize it or go there and just win everything.QIAA is sorta the Model UN group. There are weekly MUN meetings about variuous topics ranging from Ukrainian crisis to Mount Olympus in ancient times. The conferences that the go to are all over America and some in Europe with the MUN team frequently placing st in most of the conferences that they go to.I know the guys that ran it this near and the ones that are going to be running it nextr year and I must say that the club is in fantastic hands. Is it competitive to get in to? No. Is it competitive at the events? Incredibly. If you arent entirely sure what youre doing then they will guide you and they are very helpful it is ridiculous. Generally if you want to go to a conference and pay for it you will go. Very rarely are people this excited to do it and as a result they dont sign up too often. McMun and QMUN teams are very competitive with each other and I believe that Queens normally places better when McGill doesnt change their delegation size to avoid us. If you have any questions please ask me!,queensuniversity,cg4augw,4,t5_2s4y9

3468816,1,t3_2zylao,Not too many people do internships because the coop program at Queens is lackluster and expensive. Combined with the fact that nearly every engineering course is offered only during one semester a year with nearly none available during the summer. This makes it very difficult to do a  month Jan  April internship for example. Also after first year youre most likely going to be signing a  month May to May lease meaning if you get an internship thats during that time youre still paying rent in Kingston. Ive done a  month internship that I got on my own and it works out fine with school it just sucks having most of your friends graduating a year before you. If youre seriously thinking about doing an internship its probably best you look at Waterloo they have an amazing coop program McGill is also miles ahead of Queens when it comes to internships.,queensuniversity,cpno4tw,-1,t5_2s4y9

4046870,0,t3_36w3t2,Posted this yesterday to a similar question.Just finished Software Design with Professional Internship at Queens and I can say that the overall experience is good. Unlike Waterloo you usually do the entire  month internship at once usually at IBM in Markham after rd year. I found this to be better than doing  month coops because I ended up doing more advanced tasks than what I could have done in just  months. This also allows you to keep your summers or get other short term  month computing jobs. Also I found that basically no one cares about where you do your undergrad as long as you get some professional experience.Edit Would also like to add that since the faculty is quite small it is possible to really get to know the professors and get help with assignments. I never had a prof that treated me like just a number and they often knew me by first name.Additionally I would like to add that a number of us in my year have continued on to have jobs at IBM and a number of Alumni have jobs at other big companies like Microsoft. I did my internship at IBM since they offer the  month option but others have done shorter internships at Google and Microsoft. Just remember that these companies dont really care where you come from education wise. They care about what you can do and as long as you work hard work on personal projects create a portfolio etc and are enthusiastic you can get a job where ever you want.About the internship program QUIP I liked it specifically because it was  months long allowing me to do more advanced things at IBM. However IBM is the only place that I know of that offers  month internships. Personally I did my internship after rd year when I had both data structures and algorithms courses under my belt as they are arguably the most important Comp sci courses to take no matter what university you go to. Looking back however I wish I looked into internship opportunities for after my first and second year as well because the experience and money would have been invaluable. Luckily for you there are often such opportunities if you should choose to look for them.,queensuniversity,crhkoi9,3,t5_2s4y9

7426129,0,t1_d2kfudv,Consulting is all about solving problems being collaborative and being a confident leader.  Aside from the good grades youll need to get in the door spend your time in University focusing on developing these skills.  For problem solving look for things like case competitions interesting courses that will demand you think creatively and seek to lead people  whether its sports teams class projects student associations fraternities etc.  There are thousands of books about economics. Many people dont study it in high school so that not a hindrance.  Its also relatively timeless in that the underlying theories and principles really havent changed that much in a long time. Another unique aspect is its duality as a social science where its highly theoretical but also very scientific.  Theoretical in the sense that there are many conflicting theories that rely on imperfect assumptions  rational actors finite resources etc.  all of which amount to many circumstances in which you need to think critically about how realistic your assumptions are in a real world and how might reality differ from theory.  On the flip side almost all of those theories are grounded in math very often economic theories have right and wrong answers based on complex calculus or deep statistics.  This removes a lot of the subjectivity that is part of other social sciences and provides real and practical analysis and computational skills you need in business ,queensuniversity,d2max0z,1,t5_2s4y9
