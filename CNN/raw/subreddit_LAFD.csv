2973690,0,t1_co63ive,Dude I was explaining to the other guy why the LAPD gets a lot of criticism. If you think thats bitching then I think you need to cool your jets and relax a little. I dont get why youre so wound up about people talking about the LAPD that you have to come in and complain about it.,LAFD,co64h5e,5,t5_2tua3

2980643,0,t1_co6kd5j,Its a free country. Youre entitled to your opinion.Zadroga buddy. EPA screwed over all the first responders and told them the pile was fine to hang around. Most of them that didnt die or retire on PTSD have severe health problems and retired on that. I know a lot of dead guys that were on the pile including my old man.  people I know died on  about another  dozen after from complications. A real real lot of the FDNY passed away sadly. And it was  years ago. Even if they didnt retire injured they just retired by now and are collecting their pension.Because of all the lawsuits and FDNYs inability to figure a way to hire properly they threw out a real lot of exams because they FDNY couldnt figure a way to hire any black people a lot of post FDNY classes have been pretty awful since theyre hiring off the bottom of  year old lists or alternate lists.,LAFD,co6wxrr,0,t5_2tua3
3934479,0,t1_cr28ngf,uPunkAintDeadThanks for the question. TLDR We love Imgur but it is a violation of Imgur Terms of Service to post any copyright image. Explanation The vast majority of LAFD related photos we share  and some are amazing are the copyright of private not Department employee photographers who allow us to display them online as long we take reasonable effort at declaring and protecting their copyright.Many are surprised to learn we started sharing LAFD photos on Flickr four years prior to the creation of Imgur where they have amassed more than  million views. While the key benefit of Flickr has been the ability to clearly declare and reasonably protect copyright there are other features such as geocoding that Imgur has yet to offer. We apologize for the inconvenience it causes people to leave reddit and view our images on Flickr and look forward to the pending enhancements at Imgur that could make our transition there possible.Respectfully Yours in Safety and Service Brian HumphreyFirefighterSpecialistPublic Service OfficerLos Angeles Fire Department,LAFD,cr4rksd,2,t5_2tua3
