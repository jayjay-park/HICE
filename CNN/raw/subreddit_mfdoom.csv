45882,0,t3_1ukeoz,I think my favorite song on the album is Fancy Clown. I love the way he announces at the beginning Its Viktor! and then proceeds to use and awesome vocal sample to tell a sad story. All in all this is an amazing album and thank you for this analysis,mfdoom,cejnkl7,2,t5_2spn1

3371097,0,t3_2yrvfz, ? feat. Kurious Operation DoomsdayThis is MF Dooms seminal track. It presents his persona and is essentially the point where he give dues to his prior MC days and moves on from KMD and his brother Sub Rocs death which put him in a serious funk for years. Deep Fried Frenz MM... FoodI really like the callback to the Whodini Track freidsn that is sampled here. It builds on this oldschool track and shares many of the same themes about friends only being close when they can profit from you. MF Doom has some friendship issues with MF Gimm and this track embodies it. Plus the beat is just crazy dope. Rhymes Like Dimes Operation  DoomsdayThis is one of DOOMs stronger lyrical tracks. Its dense fast and only one guy could rap on a beat like that. I give it extra points for being such a unique effort. Gazzillion Ear Born Like ThisIn my opinion this is probably DOOMs best track. Its a lot of DOOM over a banging beat. Potholderz feat. Count Bass D MM FoodI tried not to include songs that had a subtantial non DOOM effort but this song has a little something that just makes it special. Its real laid back and has an interesting take on the Message from a Black Man sample that Nas put to good use a little earlier in his career. All around I find it a playful track with some varied and interesting elements to it.Notable mentionsDepuis que jtais enfant  crazy beat probably produced by DOOM and feat. by the man with a french rapperMicrowave Mayo  slappy beat and strong delivery by DOOM makes this one great Thats that  Hell all of Born Like This could be on the list.Oldschool Like That feat. Talib Kweli Good energy fun beatThe Mask  Because a DOOMGhostface track cant not get loveAccordion Short bu sweet very powerful songALL CAPS  Another defining song from DOOM.The whole Take Me To Your Leader album and specifically  Krazy World I love this album which is weird because Im not even big on Godzilla but did not include it in the list because DOOM does not take central stage in this effort. ,mfdoom,cpcj2sy,2,t5_2spn1

4902393,0,t1_cuaeiwa,This song is an extremely obvious reference to Hip hop and how DOOM first became a bopper. The song uses the idea of this girl to represent hip hop which was roughly about  years old when DOOM began spittin. The song is entitled The Mic and was one of DOOMs early works.
