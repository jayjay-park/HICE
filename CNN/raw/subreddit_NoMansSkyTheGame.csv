1260510,0,t1_cibe02k,Its actually not a confusing concept. What is confusing is the different ways that theyve been discussing multiplayer. What would you make of the quote I referenced elsewhere in this thread?gtNo Mans Sky isnt a multiplayer game in as much as youll never see another player. But the galaxy is the same between everyone and actions of significance will be shared. If you kill a single bird that wont be shared. If you make an entire species of bird extinct then those creatures will blink out of existence for everyone.gtThese are the ways in which the game is like Spore or to a lesser extent Dark Souls. Its a singleplayer experience but one enriched by a community playing with shared purpose.Either they were lying incorrect or things have changed since then. But without an explanation it is unclear whether this game actually has multiplayer in the traditional sense where you can directly interact with another player or not.,NoMansSkyTheGame,cibf8hl,2,t5_325lr

With more complex stuff like planets with complete ecosystems being procedurally generated who knows. It may be possible.Changing the subject slightly I have great expectations for this game. When Spore was released I spent  of the time terraforming sanctuaries and flying by them just for the sake of it.

That would be cool.  But then if a similar structure were to be generated elsewhere your data that you wrote Race class time of civilization existing on the first found planet etc would need to be readable at other sites so its a continuous arc of life throughout the universe.Unless you were thinking of something different P  I kinda took your words and expanded on them.,NoMansSkyTheGame,cihxtlv,3,t5_325lr

1596980,0,t3_2ch0l8,So the thing is this game is so exciting to so many of us because Hello Games are avoiding such potential pitfalls as the early access model. Without such a thing they are able to wholeheartedly put all of the time and effort that they possibly can into making the game as it should be made. The way games used to be made. And there are many fans who think this is an awesome thing and that it will help the game immensely. Right or wrong simply dont play a factor here its just better.Youre not wrong for wanting to play this game as soon as possible. We would all play it right now if we could no matter the state that its in. The reason I am typing this out is because I dont think youre going to benefit from being shown another meme that implies your perceived idiocy. Youre not an idiot you just probably dont quite grasp it yet.If Hello Games were to give us early access to the game in the form of a beta or whatever then they would have to give us a specific version as you have suggested above. The problem with this lies fundamentally in the nature of No Mans Sky as a whole. We know that this game is very sensitive when it comes to its code and engine. The way the game operates is unpredictable to even the devs at this stage and has done since inception. We know this because they have told us. Stuff happens all the time during development that they just didnt think would be possible because a small amount of tinkering here can cause catastrophe elsewhere. This is all due to the way that the game operates or more specifically how it functions at a code level.So giving us a specific version could be a huge issue that would simply detract from the development of the game as a whole. Suddenly you have thousands of people playing a version of the game that doesnt even represent the core concept of the game and theyre all flooding the devs with emails about bugs theyve found and reporting all kinds of stuff thats wrong with the game because thats how the early access model works. Consumers get an early version of the product that is slowly updated to the final product.They would have to set aside a small portion of their already small team to bugfix which again detracts from the development of the game.You see where the issues are here? Its just better that they dont give us access at all until launch. The games vision remains intact our notions regarding the concept of the game remain pure and none of that release day wonder is soiled. The game releases whole and unsullied by our passing a whole product ready for us to dive into. And more importantly it will get to us sooner with the developers that much saner for it.I hope this was more beneficial to you than a picture that is posted to make you feel bad about being excited for something that were all equally as excited for. And for what its worth I think its awesome that youre so excited about the game that youre imagining an ideal situation for yourself to play the game early in. Were all doing the same.Feel free to reply with a degrading meme now. Youve probably earned it. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,cjggvka,2,t5_325lr
1600511,0,t1_cjgj23z,Seriously though dude give it a rest. We get it Youre a sheep who cant make his own decisions who is absolutely convinced you need to know every detail about every game by watching  hour livestreams of gameplay before you purchase them. But seriously spamming threads with your scarcastic opinion quips doesnt make you right it doesnt make you funny it wont change our opinions and it makes you look childish.Knowing too much about Watch Dogs is what ruined it for everyone. Theres no point in playing a game at all if youre just going to spoil the gosh dang thing for yourself on Youtube. The point of No Mans Sky is discovery.  minutes demos and  minute tutorial walkthroughs defeats the purpose theres no point left. We already know plenty about the game unless one has some sort of aversion to reading articles to learn details about the game.The whole If you dont wanna know dont watch strawman argument isnt valid here either because as it stands No Mans Sky is one of the most anticipated games Ive ever known. Any detail would be spread across the internet in minutes and even if we didnt watch the video comments and forums would be blowing up with details and unneccesary hype. It would be impossible to avoid.Spoiling the whole game for yourself and everyone will not validate your purchase anymore than it did for Watch Dogs or any other AAA title. I can watch as much gameplay for WoW as I want but I already know I hate generic MMOs with autoattck hotkey spam gameplay. No amount of WoW videos will change that.No Mans Sky is an open world scifi survial exploration game. You can seamlessly fly between planets and solar systems there are dinosaurs you mine resources fight space pirates or join them. Theres a narrative lore but no missions players just make their own stories. You have a multitool with scan mine and attack modes. You have a suit you can upgrade a jetpack and a ship. Gameplay involves exploring fighting pirates and wildlife space sflight and combat. Its not an MMO. No crafting no players fleets no PVP battles base defense etc.If you seriously need any more information than that to know for sure if you want to buy a PS just for the game then its just not for you. Deal with it and move on. Its also confirmed for PC so just get it for PC or wait until it hopefully gets announced for XB like I intend to.I know more than enough to know though that this game is personally worth buying a PS for.,NoMansSkyTheGame,cjgww9a,3,t5_325lr

1684941,0,t3_2dnx7z,My guess given the procedural generation techniques involved that there wont be any sharing of destruction or much persistence of destruction either. A bigger question given the generation of landscape as you fly over it is how much such changes will persist even for the player. I.e. It might be a situation similar to GTA where once youve left a certain area planet local geographic region etc any changes youve made are erased  with the exception of major changes like faction disputes space station destruction. This could be really limiting depending on how many changes the engine can track  how big the cone of time and space around the player is  assuming these kind of changes are stored in local memory. Its reminiscent of how Skyrim on consoles would get slower as the game had to keep track of more and more objects and character states over the course of a save game.I suspect much of the handwaving going on re multiplayer is because it wont be possible to share any kind of meaningful perception of the world with another player. E.g. if a herd of animals or asteroid field is generated pseudorandomly from a seed value then my herd and your herd will have different specific positions and behaviours of individual members etc although the overall species and its location would be the same once its generated and the seed value shared. Its difficult to conceive of a way to get around this kind of limitation which is surely inherent to generative systems. If we both enter the system at once will the back end servers be smart enough to spin up a shard to let us play together? If thats the case then how much data needs to be shared between us? How many folks can be in the same area at once exponentially increasing the required sharing of changes  like the lag in a Day Z server.This is why I think theyre already referencing a separate conventional multiplayer DLC since this would take place in prerendered environments so to speak more conventional levels shared between players. If this intuition is correct you really wont ever be able to find your friends or if you do you will only marginally be sharing the same experience and you wont see any changes other players make on the environment in real time. Would love to hear some feedback on this from a mathematician or computer scientist. Seemly likely its the trade off for real time infinite environment generation.,NoMansSkyTheGame,cjrjttj,2,t5_325lr

That being said I dont think people will often be wandering km away or whatever on foot. Thats just tedious. But it doesnt take that kind of distance to get turned around.

2552936,0,t3_2oz0rf,Its something called procedural generation which means that the developer can just specify a general rule for creating planets and have them just be automatically generated by the computer rather than just having to handdesign them all.Heres a simple example.Say you want to draw a mathematical graph which looks like a wave. You can do it by hand and specify the list of coordinates. So you start by writing . Then you want the next point to be along a bit and up a bit so you write ... And you just carry on like this writing coordinates all day until youve covered your desk in papers. This is making the graph by hand.Alternately you can just specify a mathematical equation that will make the wave for you. Something like ysinx. And ta da!  youve made a wave in one step and you didnt have to write it all out by hand. And it only took  characters! Much more efficient. Making a procedural game works in kind of the same way. Rather than having to design  squillion planets by hand and save them all to disk the developers just make a big equation which spits out all the values for making planets size colour how many animals etc etc etc. And no planets have to be actually saved on the disc  just the equation. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,cmrt0dg,2,t5_325lr
2554517,0,t3_2oy0uk,I think that the Atlases are seeds scattered forth from some greater malevolent entity. Biding their time before they explode out across their respective planets.

I dont like my blue ship Im gonna magically turn it into red. Lets build a goddamn huge castle! Really? Thats not how youd act. The game shows how the universe is big. How few there are planets with life. Its not only exploring. Its also trying to survive. Building shelters is pointless. There are more planets without flora than with.

If we do if I understand it right the name will appear under the latinized name. Whether of not others will see it is still a source for debate see the post on bad names. Plus I myself prefer the Latin names and likely wouldnt change them unless I find something super awesome to name. I assume that every undiscovered planet will have the ability to change the names but the discovered ones will be locked in so if you say no you dont want to change it the Latin name locks in and you cant change it later,NoMansSkyTheGame,cnsampt,1,t5_325lr

2909398,0,t3_2tfhfu,A day should definitely be more than a Majoras MaskMinecraft type of day. Given that well have planet sized planets I imagine days will last from between a handful of hours for Pluto sized planets ranging all the way up to hundreds of hours for massive planets. I mean youve gotta think about the fact that just setting tilt rotation speed and orbit to vary for each planet is probably a small feat in comparison to actually generating a celestial body.There is one interesting timerelated aspect which I havent seen anybody bring up though. We should be able to fly to the dark side of a planet thereby deciding whether we land on it at day or night.

And then he got into his ship and took off. And my world was shattered. I was dumbfounded. And its been a whirlwind ever since. It means freedom. The freedom to explore. The freedom to discover.

3898469,0,t3_352cku,Rendering the pristine universe requires only three external parameters the master seed the players position and time elapsed. Positions of various nearby visible entities stars planets ships flora fauna is parametric based on those parameters.Your question revolves not around the pristine universe but a universe layered with the actions of players as well. I have wondered this same thing. Sean has stated that significant events will persist and be visible to other players. I infer this to mean things like terrain deformation this would require the server to record only an extremely compact list of events that occurred and where.For example instead of generating the planets geometry in full and recording the new vertices after they have been deformed imagine instead storing only a sort of deformation command in relation to a specific planet id when another player encounters your modification it would simply play back your modifications as if you had just done them and then present the final rendered product much like how  works. Instead of storing actual textures for instance it has a suite of drawing tools and images are stored as a sequence of highlevel commands. Terrain deformation in No Mans Sky has to work like this since it does not actually store planetary geometry.As for continuity things that are too far away from any nearby player can be thought of as still happening but not on a machine. They are happening in the sense that if you were there they would be happening in precisely the same way as they would if you were not.,NoMansSkyTheGame,cr0nqyy,2,t5_325lr

4080074,0,t1_crlcdh1,Thats very interesting however wouldnt you agree its certainly unorthodox for Sony to update their store on a day other than Tuesday or as you pointed out Wednesday? Can I also remind you I said in my original post Im not saying its outside the realm of possibility that the game will be released this summer or even June th if Sony wanted to change their update schedule. So I have you covered regarding the anomalies you mentioned.I remember reading your post but it was others who took it and ran with it. My post was aimed more at them who seem to be taking it as a DaVinci code of truth. Managing expectations is oddly a large part of staying optimistic for long term waiting would you agree?,NoMansSkyTheGame,crlcrax,2,t5_325lr
4087626,0,t1_crlkppf,Most likely true its very much a reach on which Sean himself was highly unambiguous.It makes sense too. If you can upgrade without changing ships there is less incentive to hunt for ships a huge gameplay loop in this game.,NoMansSkyTheGame,crm7qgv,1,t5_325lr
4088649,0,t1_crkvbpx,The two most common methods for calculating reflections in real time engines at the moment are reflection mapping and ray tracing.Reflection Mapping only works on static environments.  Each object is given a reflection map as well as its diffuse normal etc.  The reflection for the object is calculated based on the texture not the actual world around it.  This wouldnt work for No Mans Sky since the environments are procedurally generated. Ray tracing means bouncing the ray from the camera off of the reflective object to check what the reflection should be in real time.  This is a more processes intensive technique but allows dynamic reflections which supports No Mans Skys procedural worlds.  To make this process more efficient the rays calculating the reflection can be spread out so that you use a smaller number of them and get a blurrier reflection. This loss of detail wouldnt be noticed on mountain but it would on a deer.During one of the live demos from the Game Informer article Sean was talking about the games render distance and pop in.  He said that he was determined to push the render distance back much further for release.  All weve seen so far are Alpha builds which are always less efficient than release.  Raytraced reflection will in theory support dynamic real time reflections of plants and animals if the system is efficient enough and the hardware powerful.So dont lose hope because this feature is compatible with what I think the technique the current reflections are using.,NoMansSkyTheGame,crmbx6b,1,t5_325lr
4089932,0,t3_37gjt1,All we know is that you start at a random planet on the edge of the Galaxy universe?. If you work your hardest you can get to the center of the galaxy in  hours.So it all depends on where your friend starts. If he starts up on the opposite side of the galaxy your best bet is to meet at the center.But lets say you want to meet up somewhere else. It could take a lot of resources just to find him. You could compare galactic maps maybe. Maybe there will be a beacon system for that. And lets say you do meet up... Then you would have to stick together the whole time you play. How would he catch up with you if you continue exploring a couple of hours with out him?These are all questions that are not really answered yet. What we do know is that the creators of this game want us to explore this vast universe by ourselves. Its an infinite universe. Feel alone.

4285819,0,t1_cs8pbcp,I dont get it either honestly. I think these articles are mostly directed towards their  year old audiences because I cant see anyone younger or older asking this sort of question yet or anymore. The point of a game is the same as a good fiction to have fun and get lost in whatevers happening. People who are asking why or whats the point are probably busy and asking why and whats the point of their own efforts. Its a good question but its often a question of the tired and jaded looking for a means to filter and narrow the world so they can enjoy what theyve decided they enjoy without feeling like they may be missing out.,NoMansSkyTheGame,cs8qdox,2,t5_325lr

4292313,0,t1_cs8ndoj,Not sure why youre being downvoted.  I was also struck by how similar the random planets grass and redleafed trees were to some of the first screenshots and trailers we saw last year.  Even the ship parked on the planet looked eerily familiar...I also found it a tad too convenient that the first random planet he warped to supported life.  HG has said that lifebearing planets will be relatively rare about  in  I believe.  If so odds were we shouldnt have seen one when he jumped at random.  I suspect for the E demo purposes the engine was tweaked to make the demo jump take him to a planet with life.  The demo going well was surely too important for the team to take the very likely chance that thered be no life where he jumped to  or that the planets colors or geometry would look less than ideal.Thats why I also find it suspect that the planet looked so much like one of the first ones we saw.  It seems to me the demo was rigged to take us someplace HG could be sure would look decent.,NoMansSkyTheGame,cs9gr5p,2,t5_325lr

It was their own doing after E just going with the hype..While Game my add them indeed to the store and these may be totally real it doesnt seem to confirm anything at all. Im also pretty sure these arent from Sony at all after looking at it again. Just check the box..... it says ONLY ON PLAYSTATION and we know thats not the case at all and it has never been the case. Now maybe they think they physical release will be on Playstation only that could be the case but even that hasnt been confirmed. So I seriously doubt this is from Sony.

4524887,1,t1_ct0xtp4,Project Morpheus.  There has been a lot of speculation about it but Im betting Sony is making them hold off to either pair it with Morpheus release or to make sure it is compatible with Morpheus completely.    I know Sony has been having issues getting upcoming games up to par to bundle with the release and Sean has said that theyve been in testing with Sony to having it work on Morpheus and Oculus so now that Sony is heavily backing the game its probably because they want this to be one of the first major players for the Morpheus.    Edit Just Speculation peeps. I would love to have the game come out asap without morpheus but would also love to see it paired with it. The general vagueness of all parties means all these journalists and fans may be right or may be wrong. Im just rehashing what many others have been saying since E and before. Holding it as an absolute either way is just dumb.     And the best part about Sean is hes willing to adapt the game as he goes what hes said in the past isnt written in stone as weve seen numerous times before. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,ct1019a,1,t5_325lr

They will at the very least be cosmetically procedural. Theres also some kind of invisible faction system in the game. If you come across a space battle you can jump in and fight for a side and if Im recalling correctly both sides remember it. You can also attack space stations.

Its cringeinducing to think that there will unfortunately be these kinds of funtages of NMS inevitably and will most likely be a guy walking around a planet blowing stuff up and killing spacegoats and swearing a lot. The novelty of these videos died long ago imo now theyre just a relic of    gaming.Some people like these kinds of things but I dont really see how it would work with NMS considering funtages are usually done in multiplayer modes. In fact multiplayer experience is the only thing keeping funtages alive in . People who have no friends to play with online just end up watching a guy on youtube play with his friends and enjoy it.

4838495,0,t3_3h5gmy,Funny thing Ive been going through a few of the videos too trying to notice things I may not have noticed before or to just pause for a second and think about what Im looking at.  This screenshot for instance is very interesting to me.First of all giant snake creature takes most of our immediate attention but look in the background and in the foreground to the left.  Theres a bunch of flags all with the same design.  The one in the foreground is on a pile of rocks but those other ones look like they might be on top of buildings possibly is small ruined settlement with a distinct theme.In this image we can see though somewhat blurry an underwater cave that goes deeper than we can see and the ocean floor has abundant life in this case.  I find in some games where you can visit planets even ones with life can seem barren simply because theres a lack of small things in the environment to fill out the scene.  Not in this case.  Also on the right of the screen is a ship with air leaking out of it.  Is that our ship?  Did we land it under water?Here we can see at the very top of the image some sort of pillshaped tower.  Probably a ruin but who knows.  Is it the entrance to a dungeon?  Intuition tells me that buildings of this size will be completely explorable.  What kind of things can we expect to find inside?  Theres also a pole with a rather large flag attached to the left of the building blowing in the wind.  Its more obvious in the video but I wonder if these flags signify something.These are things Ive found within the first  minutes of looking through this video a compilation someone made that is nearly  hours long.  I have a feeling this game is replete with tiny details and things that are easy to miss much like the world we live in.  I for one will be trying very hard to not forget this when playing the actual game.

On this basis ive actually not bought ED because i get the impression i would love it the first two times and then get bored as shit after that. I miss the ps days where everything got a demo and i would buy the mag every month and buy games based on the demos i liked. Rarely ever bought a shit game and straight up shitty unpatchable games sank without a traceThis weekend i bought Everyones gone to the rapture which whilst beautifully presented felt like quite a slog and not all that gratifying at the end narratively Journey for example left me wondering what to do with the rest of the day that wouldnt just be disapointing and Dying Light which is straight up a lot of fun.

Im not familiar with the trademark system in the EU but I know that in the US such an accusation wouldnt make it any farther than the USPTO reviewing the claim.My guess is that if the whole Sky Plc thing isnt settled by release they will release regardless as any lawsuit or attempted injunction would turn against Sky Plc.Again though Im not sure how the trademark system in the EU is run.

5081990,0,t1_cuyk8p2,Well Hello Games did announce Joe Danger  a week before it came out. Now I know its not exactly the same No Mans Sky being a vastly more ambitious game but theyre still that same indie studies and theyll do things differently with the game than youd expect a AAA game to be handled although to be quite fair Id class No Mans Sky as AAA in my mind regardless. I think the thing is that Sean doesnt want to create hype because he doesnt like it and it isnt helpful for him or the hypeers so logically announcing the release and releasing the game shouldnt be too far spread apart as to avert a build up of mass hype weeks before the game is released and Sean did say at E he would announce a release date soon although coming from Sean Murray soon could mean anything. And as Sean puts it hype is an unattainable level of excitement which wont be satisfied.

All we ever saw in the leadup to release was the creature builder some glimpses of the cell and creature stage gameplay then a sudden jump to the space stage playing with the terraforming sandbox. The meat of the game existed nowhere but in Wil Wrights presentations. But people still had fun with the bits that were shown it just became more about showing off the content you created than the gameplay.We dont have that with NMS. The only thing that the game has promised so far is what weve seen in the trailers and demos a spacewalkingsim with fantastic looking procedurally generated planets spaceships creatures and stations with a little light resource managementtrade system on top. And you know what? If they released it now Id be happy and probably play the hell out of it. Thats why Im still in this sub because any new features they release are just going to be icing on the cake for me. If youre here waiting for news of features that will make or break the game for you that havent been shown yet then for your own sake just walk away and maybe check back once its released to see if it turns out to be something youd want to play.,NoMansSkyTheGame,cvp905q,2,t5_325lr

5314750,0,t1_cvqyrr8,Sorry you have still got the wrong end of the stick until is a time conditional clause so when it is used it means a state change persists after the time referenced.If i said you are not allowed to drink legally until you are  that does not mean you can only drink when you are  and once you have gone past  you can no longer drink it means when you hit  something changes and a new situation applies. Likewise saying not wanting news until release news does indeed mean your  not wanting to hear anything which i personally dont fancy myself but then nothing in the UNTIL requires himher to then change back states to the prior time. Water is solid Until it reaches  degrees C at standard pressure. human beings live until they die. We cannot play NMS until release date. None of these sentances include that there is a required reversal back to the prior state post time of clause. Whilst the statement doesnt preclude strictly the scenario you said because that is the far more unusual usage he would have clarified if he meant what you wrote or written something else like the only news i now want before release date is the release dateYou got downvoted because rather than admit you are probably wrong about what he said you would rather try and claim that your marginal unlikely usage case without context to imply it is just as valid an understanding when nearly everyone knew what he meant. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,cvr0spz,1,t5_325lr

5586761,0,t1_cwp4hqp,Thats a little like saying the goal of Mario is to walk across the playing field. I mean its technically true but its a bit of a simplification yeah?I agree completely. So please stop telling me that the game is to get to the center of the galaxy without talking about goombas and jumppuzzles bosses and princesses in castles. Youre telling me about stars and powerups. Those are all great but what GOOD are they unless there are goombas to stomp and jump puzzles to get past. I dont play mario as a powerup collection game. Were not going to agree on this. Most of what you describe is mechanics not motivations. Im not motivated to improve my ship because thats just a means to an end. Getting to the center might be an end but only if the center has some reason for me to get to it. I have no idea what that reason is. Unlocks are not interesting in and of themselves increasing levels are not interesting in and of themselves its what you can do with them in terms of defeating challenges and reaching objectives that motivate them in the first place. In multiplayer they might appeal to vanity but thats another topic.  st I would never go to the center of our galaxy. Its a pit of radiation and basically completely hostile to life. There is no good reason to visit a black hole bathed in xrays. In the game it would have to be something amazing to be a compelling objective more amazing than just thats the goal. I might climb a mountain to say I did it because its a challenge but the whole idea to go someplace just because its there leaves me cold. I go places because they are beautiful because Im curious because I want something that can be found there but if we went places just because they were there they could sell tickets to a septic tank. There needs to be some storyline some challenge beyond well this will be boring if we dont do these things we dont have to do. the ingame prompting isnt necessary the game mechanics themselves drive you to seek out harder opponents to avoid repetitive grinding. I have no idea how this can be true. Grinding is a negative fixing a game to remove a negative isnt the players motivation. Players are motivated to defeat challenging opponents. Catching Pokemon are a means to an end of defeating opponents and becoming a Pokemon Master. Whether thats a compelling game loop YMMV. And FWIW I dont replay journey and I dont consider it a game because effectively there is no way to lose and you cant actually get any better at playing it  theres no skill component to it no feeling of achievement beyond I saw it. To say I saw it works once as a player motivation. Ive been through it once found all the secrets scavenger hunt gameplay got the glowywhite robes and thats kind of it for me. It doesnt devalue it as a work of interactive media but I dont consider it to be a game at all. core game loop of exploring to obtain powerups to get access to new areas is very comparableIs that really why people play Metroidvania games? To see the new areas? See I dont believe any of this. It might be true for pureexplorer archetypes I have a high explorer score but its not infinite but not for most people. I play games to be challenged and stimulated to get a feeling of accomplishment over some difficult obstacles not to look at unlocked ship graphics and see the RNGs output some more. Thats a screensaver. I can get procedurally generated artwork any time I want. At which point you tell me that This game is not for YOU. Well... okay... guess Ill keep my moneyAs far as NMS is concerned Im pretty hopeful that there is compelling motivations and challenging obstacles in there but I havent seen any of it in the E demos. Not to commit heresy but it looks like a walking simulator in a nature preserve with security guards that get mad if you taunt the animals. Why do I need to taunt the animals and get into a conflict with sentinels in the first place? Whats in it for me?,NoMansSkyTheGame,cwpl8rt,1,t5_325lr

5660888,0,t3_3sne4m,I get what the OP is going for but comparing a space sandbox game like NMS or Elite to movies tv shows books and other non interactive media is a bit unfair. Non interactive media doesnt happen in real time its filtered to give you only the most interesting bits and leaving anything unnecessary aside. You wont see Darth Vader singing in the shower while on his way to the next system to conquer or Han Solo doing boring cargo runs everyday. These sandbox games on the other hand are in virtual real time where not every second something exciting is happening and you must actively search for the action.About NPCs I agree they should be more dynamic.

All of that will be the same through all the systems.Performance is going to be better on PC. Unless they have focused on building it for the PS and do a poor job porting it to PC the performance will always be better on the PC.Graphics is a big maybe. There might be some minor differences. The overall resolution will be better on the PC but the actual textures might come out the same depending on what they do for the game release. Its possible they may have to reduce shipscreatures that appear at once and how many treesshrubbery appear on the worlds.In the end I dont think PS players will see much of a restriction.

6182013,0,t3_408mpl,I found this GR article interesting GamesRadar  Sept.   TLDR  Section talking about the multitool aka weapongt The gun you carry is more than just a weapon handling scanning and mining duties alongside the potential for catalysing mass extinction events. It can be upgraded by adding alien technologies which youll discover and combine throughout your travels to a grid menu that represents the tools innards and placing similar techs next to each other offers further performance boosts. Your scanner for example starts out as a shortrange directed beam but with the right tech can become a widereaching pulse that emanates out from you. The improved scanner can also detect resources buried beneath the surface or in rocks and you can then use your laser to mine them. In a lot of scifi games all their weapons are basically AKs with some red stripes down the side Murray says. We dont like that we want something that feels advanced and cool.

6823819,0,t3_494fdt,My idea is that the player could purchasebuild their own Space Station allowing other players and NPCs Because players would be a huge minority to use your station to trade and buy ships giving you a small income based on what is traded. Expanding on this the player could put his own materials and elements up for sale allowing them to be sold whilst mining and exploring other planets for more things to sell. When the player creates a second station in another system they could then invest in NPC pilots and ships that can travel between the players station to stock them with resources harder to come by in its native system. You could create a trade empire this way and really flesh out the trader aspect of the game. Then a little more ambitious other player could If they find your station opt to work or you carrying or acquiring stock for a wage. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d0ps1iu,1,t5_325lr
6824918,0,t1_d0pu18a,I dont think using a pirate version is really the right approach. It would be better to just email and tweet HG asking them to move up the release date for everyone.However the GOG version is certainly DRM free so inevitably it will be available immediately no cracks required. The Steam version may also be DRM free Steamworks DRM is not a prerequisite of being available through Steam. Once downloaded it may be possible to launch the game directly from the .exe without the Steam client opening. If that is the case then its just as easy to copy as the GOG edition.But dont pirate it DRM free is consumer friendly so respect dev for trusting the majority. If there is some aspect price staggered release date that you you dont like complain politely and choose something else to play and maybe buy the game later when its on sale.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d0pwjbz,1,t5_325lr

What that does to the listener is interesting because the same musical idea gives you so many different emotional responses. dos does that a lot too but will do more to ratchet up or down the tension at will. But postrock has some extensive vamping to be sure. I find myself getting lost in the intense parts just trying to take everything in.

However a vast open world sandbox like No Mans Sky would be an excellent nursery for competing lifeforms although you would probably need to start with the simplest creatures as in Spore  the difference being that there would be no human intervention not even to select the more successful mutations as everything would have to survive or die on planets isolated from each other by deep space until they had evolved space travel or annihilated themselves.It is by no means a stupid question and No Mans Sky likely success will drive us towards more experimental research in this area some of which will be funded in part by making the technology into a game.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d101so7,2,t5_325lr

6923386,0,t3_4aj2vk,So Ive read through the comments and Im shocked that no one has pointed out that Destroying anything Atlas included isnt really the point of the game. Yes you CAN run and gun if you want  it looks dauntingly hard  but the game seems weighted towards exploration and pacifism. Given that is the overall impression of that being the game Sean set out to create in the first place why would you put a malevolent Death Star atlas at the center? Not to mention that IF the thing at the center IS Atlas and you DO have to destroy it...the first person to DO SO would erase all of the content uploaded by all the players in the universe. I really feel like everyone is caught in the trap of thinking of this game in terms of what theyve experienced before.

I think that most of the people who will be naming planets anything rude or stupid will either soon get over it or stop playing altogether. Of course there are exceptions but their numbers will be much smaller.What this means is that as we get closer to the centre there is a higher chance of meeting people but fewer of those people will be naming things stupidly. The result is that most of the planets that you see are going to have sensible names.If you come across a planet with a rude name laugh until its not funny which may be a short or long period of time depending on name and your taste in humour and carry on.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d15ymy2,40,t5_325lr

Youll be discovering new ships new weapons new Technologies upgrades which will completely change how you play the game for example Technologies that give special abilities to your ship like stealth or explosives for your multitool for miningdestroying things on planets. There might also be features we havent been told about similar to the portals weve seen in a past trailer which allow you to teleport to a random planet and collect resources and explore then pass back through the portal and return to your ship. Features like that will certainly impact your gameplay experience and wont be very common and simply hunting for those discoveries will provide you with hours of entertainment.Well be discovering new compounds or products combinations of elements which can be soldpossibly used in crafting since HG wont give us any guides on what all the combinations are. Im confident when NMS comes out we wont simply be discovering new planets and creatures in some kind of walkingflying simulator.

The cubes that dont rotate around the outer rings of the cube cant be moved to the outter portions... so that right there drastically lowers the amount of combinations even further.

Some sort of conflict that the players can choose sides with. Thatd be awesome and would no way take away from the exploration aspect. The best part is? You dont even have to get involved or even know its going on. But the option to do so to be that space pirate or mercenary or dogfighter in a galactic war now thats immersion. Or you can explore and discover. Or build a monopoly of resource mining and trade. But we cant  ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d1kllia,-6,t5_325lr

Its not like hand crafted worlds where the devs can hide things. HG would have to write the code to procedurally generate the easter eggs and there to be enough of then so that people will discover them. Personally I dont think NMS is the type of game where there will be the best ship  weapon suit upgrade etc  it will be down to personal taste and what you need plus I feel everything will be available to everyone  we just need to find it so nobody can end up being the most powerful. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d1nfgdo,3,t5_325lr

7148976,0,t1_d1q5f1b,Im glad theyre making this game as well  however I obviously wish the existing multiplayer support allowed players to easily play together rather than being determined to keep everyone spread apart.Spreading explorers out is a fine idea.  But I do wish the developers would get onboard with the idea that some players strongly prefer to have a solo experience in a group if that makes sense.  For example I play many of my games with a particular friend who I have known most of my life  when it comes to our gaming were joined at the hip and prefer to keep it that way.  At the same time we find that we generally prefer to stay away from other players because they easily annoy us.  Even when were playing an MMO we make an effort to play that MMO together yet separated from everyone else.  We are alone but we are alone together  and thats just how we prefer it.So thats a big part of the issue I take with the developers vision  this naive idea that you cant have a private personal journey unless you are  isolated from every other human being.  Maybe thats the case for some people and if so I pity that they dont have the kind of bond that I do with some of my friends.  But that doesnt change the annoyance when a design is determined to keep us apart.As for the suggestion of playing CoD GTA V etc.. that would be useful advice if the interest was in playing those games together.  Its not.  The interest is in playing No Mans Sky together so recommending other games especially ones that are so far removed in concept from this one doesnt really help.Before anyone suggests that we cant play No Mans Sky together.. thats false.  We can.  Its just a pain in the rear to do so which is the meat of my complaint  one that just seems to be there simply for the sake of encouraging solo play in a game thats determined to incorporate multiplayer elements into its design.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d1qrkof,0,t5_325lr

7172992,0,t1_d1th08q,Well I suppose you could create a modstructure where it applies a second layer of procedural generation on top of the base game procedure if you really wanted to. But it would only apply to your game. No one else would be able to visit a planet in YOUR universe and see those structures unless they had the same exact secondary procedural generator. And each version of a mod would probably alter the compatibility between modders. And this doesnt even take into consideration the performance issues that would likely arise. Youre creating a second layer of generation atop the original generation  it probably wouldnt be a doubling of the load on the GPU but it would increase it.

7270707,0,t1_d24lpd1,Hmmm ok thats what I thought you were saying which leads to me asking why you got the impression it wasnt done in the macro way? You just explained exactly how the game is supposed to work. Choose a freighter or fighter each having different perks. Then within that given role there are further choices to upgrade those perks further or maybe use free slots for resources. Then buy better versions of your ship to further improve the stats or inventory and at some point I assume there will be a maxed ship suit gun in each playstyle. I think your comparison with charms from Diablo really is what threw me off as there is no comparison between the two games simply because there is a single role in Diablo thus there is only one choice to make killstay alive better. As I said in my first post we just dont know for sure what the upgrade system actually works like. We have concepts but no concrete idea of just how much inventory we get how much space upgrades take do upgrades stack? Or do I need to use multiple spaces for each upgrade in a given stat? Are there upgrades that are only possible with certain ship types or can all ships get any upgrade etc? At the very core of it I still dont agree qol vs effectiveness is a bad game mechanic. Sure maybe in Diablo or wow or something where there is really only one purpose to the game kill things but thats not what this game is about. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d24mozg,2,t5_325lr

If that is the case then the issue becomes not just the time it takes to meet them but actually finding out where they are. As for the classic question why cant I haz multiplayerz? The answer is that the devs just wanted it to be a solo experience.

That must be an impossible to maintain server.Not really as its procedural a planet or system only exists when youre there and the furthest things you can view are there only at the lowest level of detail. The stars you see are real stars and the planets real planets but theyre not taking up much space. If you cant see anything at all its not even generated.Think of it like generating the world in Minecraft as you walk you generate more of the world  and things get pretty taxing after a while because Minecraft is saving a lot of this information.No Mans Sky however throws this information in the trash when its not needed  the planet is simply regenerated from the same seed if you will when you return.How does it handle your information?

So if this holds true it would slow them down.

7390561,1,t1_d2i5ydk,Based on this video and some of the earlier ones Im almost positive at this point that planets dont rotate. Not sure that they revolve around their star either for that matter.The earlier clue was that even in space when flying over a planet the sunrisesunset numbers never changed though presumably you were moving eastwest along the surface which would change the times for both. I assume a global time zone which seems likely.My guess is that sunrise and sunset occur globally at every location on a planet which means no rotation. It also seems likely that every planet has the same daynight cycle length although not necessarily the same sunrise and sunset times. Im not sure if there is a universal time or if each planet has its own local planetary time but given what weve seen of time so far my guess is the former.Also based on the movement of the animal we see near the trees this isnt h of gameplay compressed into m but more like m. So in NMS it seems likely that  game minute   reallife second and I think this is pretty much confirmed by how the time changes in other videos. This isnt really a surprise Terraria and some other games use the same time compression ratio but as someone whos hoping for as much realism as Hello Games can manage to fit it is a little disappointing.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d2i98qa,-4,t5_325lr
7391215,0,t3_4gjvsh,Heres a random thought but a possibility it could be a bug. They use PG to make everything so I noticed in the one video the generation seems more tied to movement then time solely based on gut feeling but all programs have ugly secrets under the covers. Just computationalwise it seems pretty intensive to compute all possible stars that can be seen in such a big expanse so they might only have a certain range defined while sitting still to update in real time,NoMansSkyTheGame,d2ibxcz,4,t5_325lr

7395263,0,t3_4gkcph,Things I noticedStars dont move so it makes me wonder if once you land on a planet the game creates a skybox out of what was around where you landed and just leaves it stationary but merely rotates the light source around.Take this vs in space engine when you speed up time the whole sky will rotate as expected along with the sun.Grass and leaves dont move. Particles blow around everywhere but the vegitation remains oddly still which is quite contrasting and a bit disconcerting.These two things combined leave me wondering if these are technical limitations placed on the game after it became clear that the PS just didnt have what it took to do everything they wanted.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d2isjoe,6,t5_325lr

7454114,0,t3_4hfnfv,I spent a lot of time playing spore. The size fascinated me. I never heard of it prelease so wasnt part of the hype train. I think the key letdown was the details. For me what really let it down is by the end of it you barely see creatures since theyre so tiny they dont make a difference. Planets are small with the same structures and same ships flying around. Whats left? Ship parts had no variation either. For the whole universe there were a very limited tier of weapons drives ships and buildings.The only thing that really varied in spore was tiny creatures you barely noticed and planets which were also tiny.  I hope weapons and drives at least have variation in NMS while we know ships already do.Time will tell whether the variation in NMS is enough. The fact that landscapes are huge already adds a lot more value than spore managed since those planets you could orbit within a few seconds. Then while spore had variation in a lot of creatures you barely noticed since they were tiny figures think sim city. In comparison NMS creatures you can actually walk up to and get a sense for the details. Huge creatres are noticeably huge while there are bipedal creatures much like yourself as well as smaller dogsized creatures. Everything in Spore was essentially the size of us as humans. So it all became a bit repetitive. Great concept but not enough detail to avoid the feeling of obvious repetition. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d2phhhv,7,t5_325lr

Lets not get into loads of detail but you can say that were going to have a way for players to communicate with each other and leave little messages and things like that. gtGI Written messages?SM Thats the plan at the moment. Have you played Terraria? When you die you leave a gravestone. It says a Quakestyle thing like Sean got hit with an ax. Sean fell down a big hole. That kind of thing. Thats what they say. But when they bring that up when you die the cursor is there and you can actually just delete it and write in whatever text you want. It sounds like a small thing but its so amazing. You walk around this world and then youve got all of these like silly stories that people have left. gtThe reality is the messages are always too late because its the gravestone. So its always like I fell down here too. They are really funny. People cant resist. Its like Twitter. You cant resist making that joke. gtGI Is it any message at any time or just on death?SM For us we are going to just have a place where you can leave messages.

That would have been so excitinginterestingfun if I hadnt already seen it in some trailer prerelease demo. I remember seeing like two trailers for Uncharted  and having every big scene in the game ruined. It sucked. Best believe I stayed far as hell away from trailers and screenshots and even reviews of Uncharted  and its made all the difference in my enjoyment.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d385cah,2,t5_325lr

7729614,0,t3_4l6ort,Well honestly unless you know the people at the store most of the time they arent allowed to talk about things like that anyway.  Back when I worked at an EB Games as Halo  came out we had people called for days before hand if we had it.  Of course we did we had it a week before over  copies!   But we werent allow to even say Yeah but its street dated we were only allowed to say No but we will on Tuesday.    ampnbsp    I know there was once or twice in the yrs I worked there where we did have to quickly take down some marketing materials because said game was getting delayed and even cancelled and were overnighted new materials to replace asap.  I dont remember what games and this was at least yrs ago.    ampnbsp    I mean hope there is no delay but just saying if you called  some Gamestop and asked about it they would only tell you what they were scripted to say about it especially over the phone they cover the butts.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d3ksw5o,2,t5_325lr

7756640,0,t1_d3nuelx,I suspect it is not so much completely unforseen circumstance but instead a circumstance they were aware of but didnt realise was going to be as hard to fix as it turned out to be. Then they probably got caught up in a series of fixes that didnt work and finally realised that barring a miracle it couldnt be done in the remaining time. That probably happened a week or two ago and they started getting things ready for an orderly announcement of delay after giving all the companies they have contracts with a bit of forewarning.

7759925,0,t1_d3nuelx,I dont think the delay is ridiculous more than them just not saying anything. I dont think they didnt know until right now. Hell Jason claims they knew for a few weeks. Best case scenario that some one else put out is they worried they might need to but didnt want to say yet and waited until there was no choice as it had to be out to get it to retailers to actually make the decision maybe also with a little push from the rumor being posted. I suppose I can forgive them for indecisiveness and not wanting to make that decision unless they had to.  But if they knew and said nothing I do think thats a little irksome not enough to hassle the guy over though... people doing that are ridiculous and need to get some sense of perspective.

Its OK that there will be no gas giants in game because each planet is supposed to be explored.

Listen to some of his movie soundracks from about  years ago and later and youll notice he somehow went out of ideas along the way at least quite often.And honestly Zimmer isnt alone with this.

You could also add Biomespersystem as a metric but thats really just a rewording of Bodiespersystem.

8003272,0,t1_d4fmsoc,gt Well I dont think the Wii has been forgotten. Look up how much it sold!That was the point. It was ridiculously popular for a few years and the consoles sold but near the end games sales dropped way off as most Wiis had been retired to collecting dust. Nintendos american fans had to plead with the company to even bother localizing some of its best games and without that added publicity it may have never been worth it to do so. And most importantly the motion controls themselves didnt have lasting appeal in later titles like Skyward Sword they were much maligned as clunky and gratuitous where a traditional control scheme wouldve worked better.Kind of sad on that front because I actually think they were on to something with the Wii Remote  Nunchuk combo. More ergonomic because each hand can move independently instead of being locked in place and economic because the control stick is what usually goes first on controllers and a nunchuk is cheaper than a whole new controller. But they knew they needed to hop on the next big thing and we got the tablet controller...,NoMansSkyTheGame,d4fn6fp,1,t5_325lr

No offense intended but just because a game is massive and has multiple players that doesnt make it massively multiplayer. Even if it had a massive number of players occupying the same apace its still not quite a correct translation of massively multiplayer. Generally for a game to be considered massively multiplayer you need to be playing withagainst or usually both other players. To be blunt massively multiplayer refers to how pivotal other players are to the experience of the game not just the scope of players occupying the same server.

The rest of the algorithm remains the same but by changing the variable you are describing or drawing circles of different sizes. When you generate a planet you create a seed. A seed might look something like oxift. The last number in this case  might be the area of the planet. Every time the planet is generated its size will always be . the letter x might be the variable for the atmosphere where x is poison atmosphere. So you have a  type planet with x atmosphere. Finally ift could represent the geography of said planet. Every time the planet loads it plugs these numbers into the geography generating algorithm. Just like the area of a circle with a radius of  will always equal . because we are plugging the same information in to the geography generating algorithm the geography will always come out the same. This  is an overly simplified explanation but i hope it gets the point across.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d4udl3r,2,t5_325lr

Assuming the starting galaxy has similar diameter to Milky Way  merely some k light years give or take  and assuming that warping for  light years in one jump is far from the maximum warp distance possible with upgraded explorer type warp drives it can well be as few as  warp jumps for some k light years each. Give or take of course. And of course you aint getting most powerful warp drives when you start  far from. Even if its  or  warp jumps  jumps themselves are real quick the only issue is fuel of course.Overall i think experienced player would be able to reach the center of starting galaxy in mere hours once he knows what hes doing and what are the most quick ways to get himself large amounts of fuel and one of most fuelefficient warp drives.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d4ve163,2,t5_325lr

There was another desert looking planet with a HUGE star visible in the sky presumably quite close with what looked like plant life.Therell be a reason resource availability to visit those planets that seem either too close or too far to sustain life regardless.  ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d4wtop9,1,t5_325lr

Placement in another players lobby is entirely random and only supports a couple of players max. So you could be standing right next to someone and not see them.. If one of you dies you have to find each other again and it could respawn you far enough enough to be kicked from the lobby.. You cant both take the same resources so blueprints and new tech can only go to one of you..

I think a major source of confusion for skeptics is the difference between This game will be perfect amazing and the best of all time! and Even if the only thing to do in this game is what they showed at E years ago thats enough for me and Im totally on board!.  I think many of us are not as articulate in our praise as we could be and some are purposefully hyperbolic to please the internet gods and Sean.Speaking only for myself I dont care at all about trade pirates crafting etc.  none of it matters to me at all.  You could literally take all of that out of the game and I wouldnt bat an eye. At the same time Im not preaching that this game will be the best game ever and will appeal to everyone because of its inherent greatness.  For me personally NMS appeals to something deep in my soul that I havent the art to fully articulate.  The best I can do is thisFirefly Star Trek Star Wars  all these and more to set me up.  Then one day I see this    and my heart skips a beat the audience audibly sharing my reaction... then Sean says and I can even go a little faster at the  mark and I literally shed a tear.This game might not surpass WoW or CoD in popularity among mainstream gamers and Im not trying to argue that it should.

8229293,0,t1_d567a49,You know i respect this opinion you got. I dont agree but i respect it. If that pisses you off who am i to tell you not to be pissed off! Surely im nobody in this matter. Every one of us has some allergies specific to our own personal constitution so to say. Can respect that. Can i ask you a question though. Lets suppose Sean Murray and the team somehow spent that June time implementing brandnew version of the tech which in fact made planets Earthsized. Or at least Marssized. You know thousands kilometers in diameter. So tell me how exactly those bigger planets will be better for you playing the game? And in particular how much time you think itll take to go around Earth in a ship which can do  kmh tops if you find yourself in the situation where youre willing to visit two points of interest the second of them being the opposite side of the planet from the st? The latter question is obviously quite rhethorical. To me good gameplay takes priority and thus i support choices which Hello Games demonstrably made about size of planets. Im just a bit curious if youd still give NMS a try or would turn away from it because of this and probably some similar things pissing you off. But just a tiny bit.

IIRC there wont be ways to trade any items or anything but you WILL be able to see each other however the lobby cannot connect to many people I think there was talk about  people? at once I will try to look for that video later on when I get time.EDIT Okay I cannot find that video anywhere but Im  sure Ive heard this being said somewhere but dont take it for certain about the whole multiplayer thing but thats how Ive heard its gonna go.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d5702t5,6,t5_325lr

The Swedish word for brain fart is brain release.Anyways funny enough I dreamed once that in my dream HE did the same thing said a new expression. In the dream I really had to take a whiz. Hmm lots of those dreams I guess... anyways I decided to go on the bed because in the dream that was a convenient thing to do piss in the bed so I didnt have to go look for a bathroom. And my friends Robb and Kim stood in the doorway after and asked what I was doing. I said I needed to take a whiz so I used the bed. And Kim said ah youre doing the fish torment.

8237401,0,t1_d56o2pe,Your graphics card wont have that much to do with the draw distance its more about CPU. In most games you see precomputed polygon meshes and your GPU capabilities will determine how many polygons it can render and the draw distance will be set on that basis.NMS on the other hand has to first work out what polygons are where. That means that on the fly your machine has to compute the voxels for the terrain using surface displacement D noise erosion etc polygonise those voxels work out what materials are required for the terrain work out from formulae what plants animals and buildings should be within view generate the forms and colours of those items from other algorithms polygonise those and only then send it to the GPU for rendering. It does those at multiple levels of detail so that you can see continents etc from space then replaces those with finer detail as you get closer. Thats why on the earlier videos you can see the terrain switching from large triangles to finer ones with added elements stones trees etc especially when flying quickly.Innes McKendricks video points out that the LODswitching was annoying to the developers too and theyve vastly improved the performance since then. It will still be noticeable especially if youre zooming around a lot I intend to focus on walking so it wont bother me too much but the faster your CPU the greater the range within which itll be able to calculate the fine detail as you move. GPU will definitely help since they also couldnt prebake lighting occlusion etc like most games do but CPU will have more effect.In short the quasipopin isnt because HG is a small studio who couldnt afford to optimise performance its because theyre doing things in real time that no game has done before.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d578bk1,2,t5_325lr

Then they could add those additional to a the outer part of the galaxy b in the interior of the galaxy increasing the density of solar systems or c have an entirely separate galaxy to explore.Each of the options would present some game design problems such as a split of the goodold planets we used to have and the new shiny ones with the new cool stuff.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d580ie8,1,t5_325lr

8270081,0,t1_d5b97bg,Youre certainly getting higher results than Im expecting I could chalk it up to the fact that youve got some of the more taxing settings turned off. Youve got smoothing off Im assuming thats what theyve called AA youve got render distance turned down and youve got vsync off. A card like the Ti would manage Planetside  at higher settings and get higher framerates than you at p. Thats not surprising though thats well above the recommended settings. Its also possible youre punching above your weight because youve got GBs of RAM and a beefy CPU so theres no bottlenecks in this scenario.If you had Dark Souls  or Witcher  something modern something with a high minimum GPU requirement Id ask you to run that and see what you came back with. The issue with ARK as far as Im aware is that its taxing only because its poorly optimised. I would give No Mans Sky a shot but I would be surprised if it ran acceptably. Youve got a  hour refund policy on Steam so if youve played less than two hours you could always get your money back. You might be able to kill a lot of settings depending on how good the options are and play comfortably  but at that point many people would look into getting a PS instead.Are you running this laptop for school university business etc.? If not you could potentially consider selling it  you did say it was a high end Lenovo model youd get a lot back especially if its new. With the money you could purchase a very highend desktop PC the issue with laptops is youre not getting a lot for your money youre getting portability. I personally have a very cheap laptop that I use for university and a desktop PC at home I use for gaming its the most costeffective aside from having a laptop and a console that is.  ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d5bbhbh,1,t5_325lr

8301760,0,t3_4t5z46,I think that could be a lot of fun for some interesting ecosystems that really capture your attention but I dont think I want to spend too much time pushing at those limits in the game or at least not at first. We know that there are passiveaggressive predatorprey daynight ect. emergent behaviors in the game but I kind of doubt theyll have the depth to survive deep inspection with your sense of wonder intact.  Weve seen these kinds of behavioral patterns in other games before like The Elder Scrolls or Grand Theft Auto.  And while in passing they succeed in giving their digital world a sense of depth and reality deep scrutiny reveals the limitations and repetitiveness of the AI rather quickly.  Once that illusion is shattered its hard to recapture that feeling of amazement once youve looked behind the curtain. If this game really holds the attention of the gaming community for long its inevitable that those sorts of limitations are going to become apparent anyhow.  Were talking about an absolutely enormous game made by an absolutely tiny development team and that AI behavior is more about giving the game flavor instead of the core focus of the games design.  But I for one am in no hurry to shatter the illusions NMS employs to provide us with an immersive experience. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d5fa0fx,2,t5_325lr

A ship is flying in front of him before he goes into the map and is still there about  minutes later just before he warps. Edit  Zooms into map starting a little after  and then exits map to warp at about . Watch the ship that is ahead of him.It mightve been because the showing was a special build but my bet is that there is a pause function or maybe just in the galactic map but not during inventory and crafting management.

8350080,0,t3_4ty2rl,Those are all RPGs some of them like The Witcher have an amazing story and lore and all that behind them. Skyrim has a great story great factions and quests and character customization. That all makes for a great single player experience.The reason NMS gives off a multiplayer vibe is because it lacks all of the things that made those games great AFAIK. Imagine playing LoL or CSGO with only bots. That wouldnt be much fun.Im not saying NMS wont be fun im probably going to get it day one but it does seem to lack features of any other single player game I have ever enjoyed. Lack of customization is the biggest hit for me.If you wanted to draw comparisons on the MultiplayerSinglePlayer aspect Elite Dangerous would be closer. ED is fucking terrible imo. Nothing but a grindfest to get to the better ships. Even combat got boring in it. It was as wide as an ocean but as shallow as a puddle. Better MP would have helped but not save that game.Im hoping NMS is both wide and deep but it does seem sparse in features for a SP game.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d5lbaa1,2,t5_325lr

8358673,0,t1_d5m9uvo,Yeah six sigma is production based it will give a good base but its a bit old school now  about  years since it was created.In terms of large project management you need overarching timelines for each specific task.A good way to create this is using excel and making a gant chart you start with the finished product and date and effectively work backwards which gives you a clear path of every single activity that needs to be done whos doing it and when it will be completed by. This in conjunction with weekly meetings will enable you to pretty accurately deliver your project or at least know when things start concertinaIng in the middle.Someone somewhere always underestimates the real time involved so you need to factor in some slippage.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d5mdwqp,1,t5_325lr

Some guy spent over a grand for a damn game. Thats what happens when the information is available to people who will do anything for that information.But to have him jump to twitter to tell everyone to stop spoiling the game is insane. For a week now weve all been asking for one single tweet to clarify the PC release date. Its obvious that the community is confused about it. If the North American PC version was actually and  truly coming out on the th then what the fuck would stop him from saying that?

They handled the June delay in the worst possible way and then seemingly havent learned from that and are now making the exact same mistake with what appears to be another delay for PC. Im not even playing on PC and I think thats unprofessional as shit. And then to add insult they respond within minutes to a video they dont like with tweets and takedown requests. Some people defend their silence on the delays by saying its a business thing but other developers have announced delays without new release dates being finalized yet and its just common courtesy to respond to hundreds of people asking you about an issue even if all you can say is I cant comment on that.Obviously the more childish fans took it too far as they always do but these are legitimate complaints with HGs PR and it does not make the game look good to hide gameplay videos while trying to brush delays under the rug. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d5x4zzd,0,t5_325lr

8450275,0,t1_d5xq44f,Thats certainly fair and there does seem to be a bit of antihype spreading as a defense from disappointment. But with passion and anticipation for something comes anxiety as well and I think that is just what we are seeing here. In normal scenarios that anxiety is dispelled at least partially through footage interviews explanations of the mechanics etc. Whether procedural like Guild Wars  revealing the professions and mechanics over months or all at once like Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild releasing hours of footage and interviews at E developers have learned that the way to fix consumer anxiety is through communication and transparency to some extent. This is where Niantic is struggling greatly with Pokemon Go and where I think NMS has equally produced a lot of anxiety and backlash in stifling transparency. Lets face it Our society today is filled with options and things to do. When we encounter something we often ask ourselves to some degree if it is worth our time. A person a job a game a movie. We compare with other options and prioritize for one reason or another. We do this by getting information. So people see No Mans Sky and ask themselves if its worth it worth it to spend time learning about it and thinking about it worth the money to purchase it instead of something else worth the time spent playing it instead of doing something else worth it to get excited and emotionally invested at the risk of disappointment etc.?By keeping information away from the consumers for sake of spoilers and surprise the consumers will become anxious about whether or not they made the right choice based on any of those worth it questions or criteria. And here we are encountering people on this subreddit and other forums verbalizing this and wanting to know if its safe to experience passion and investment in something or if the developers are hiding a disappointing and shortlived product. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d5xtkdj,2,t5_325lr

8461464,0,t1_d5z26sx,I avoided all official statements about the game cause Ive had devs hype a game before only to be let down when I bought it. I figured Id wait for the release and see what its like from people playing on Twitch. But I did watch the leak cause it was actual game play...I have to say since I didnt know anything about the game or what to expect that I am now excited for the game. The leak didnt show much more than  min on one planet and the guy was not very good at playing these type of games the ones where you have to farm certain resources and decide where to use those resources to gain the most from them but it seemed like a well made game with plenty of new and exciting details in it. Im sure itll be easy to get lost in it for a while I have to wait to see other planets to see if the gameplay will get stale or if it will continue being exciting though. I could see it as being a fairly shallow game and that would be disappointing. As is though I am now looking forward to its release I will watch it on Twitch and decide if I think I can get  worth of entertainment out of it. I think I can though.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d5z7w5q,0,t5_325lr

8466879,0,t1_d5zraia,Another redditor got a PS copy from ebay last week started playing already. Leaked a bunch of footage supposedly and then opted to not release any more videos.Otherwise my understanding is basically people are falling into optimismpessimismapathy. The optimists are the redditors for this sub up until a few weeks ago and basically anybody who reads about or watches the game videos and says oh cool and gets excited about it. My anecdotal experience  is that while the optimists are hyped they also seem to realize that they get to choose how they feel. There are skeptics but they are generally positive.My impression of the pessimists is that these are people who dont enjoy exploration games games without a welldefined main story and quest structure games without other people and games without leaderboards. They are consistently the ones asking what do you do despite having supposedly watched demo and interview videos about the game think that people getting hyped are stupid and feel the need to criticize not just the game but also other people.Apathy is literally everyone else.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d5zwcd6,2,t5_325lr

The biggest disappointment for me has been the lack of truly major geological features which I had been hoping would be part of the big payoffs of going wholly procedural. I am guessing that there were developmental challenges keeping fully procedural terrain with major deformation from glitching and breaking and as a result the algorithms were tuned too conservatively. Id rather have a glitchier game with a universe full of landscapes even more amazing than earth than one where on  quintillion planets there is nothing to equal the Grand Canyon Everest the Amazon basin.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d61jurp,1,t5_325lr
8480465,0,t1_d614yp2,It could be possible that there really are better ships and things to do and the new galaxy he went to is closer to the center of the universe. Our universe has no center but thats because it is ever expanding from all points. But NMS is a stable and finite universe. Thus it has a center. This is assuming its a universe thats actually connected and you can fly from one galaxy to another.

And other developers will learn from it. It is the middle finger right before the release with no warning before this without a reasons that pisses me off dam the wait in it self is the smallest issue here to be honest. it is the way it has been done without any good reason. though it sounded like if they could have also pushed back ps release with  days they would have done it. but it seems they got forced to hold the th for it while retailers stopped carring about the release date and shipping ps copies and than this move .. man .. no sorry it makes the whole thing just worse ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d668di8,2,t5_325lr

8517440,0,t3_4wdssv,Every one wonders whats out there but no one alive today will ever get to explore other solar systems and very few of us will get to physically step on other worlds. Essentially NMSs appeal is that it both feeds and fosters this yearning the deep impossible desire to know which is at the root of all science fiction. The scale of its universe is amazing but more importantly its critical to stimulating this feeling.

8518408,0,t1_d66cr1t,LOL I suppose.  I will say that finding a lady who accepts your hobby isnt so hard.  You just have to make it nonoptional or as some prefer a deal breaker.  Not that I play constantly of course but when I was dating I set firm guidelines with ladies once things got past a certain point.  Even a single nitpick whatsoever about  topics was immediate grounds for me to walk away.  The first was that my son comes first every single time.  I lost several ladies over that one and good riddance.  The second was that I play video games and I do it almost daily often for quite a while at a stretch due to my limited mobility due to a disability.  I lost one over that.All of these ladies were great otherwise to be sure but these two issues are just absolutely nonnegotiable for me.  My wife I am with now also does her own thing as all adults should from time to time and respects that I do my own thing sometimes.Sorry for the rant but this is a pretty common issue I hear about from folks and it neednt be such a problem.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d66d0yb,1,t5_325lr

8536613,0,t1_d68moky,gt Ever is a very strong word.When the game is good the game gets bought.  A game cant be good until it is released.So ever is the right word  a game goes gold  days before release because the publisher wants to spend  days on nonrefundable TVweb advertising and other marketing efforts to get people to preorder before they know better.  Which is why the NMS team spent the last  days making the game better  because marketing was keeping them to a firm release date because preorder numbers were telling them they had to release it sooner than later.If we just waited until the game was good and then bought the game so much pressure would be off of the developers and publishers wouldnt be caught in a situation where they either had to wait until the game was good or they had to advertise the shit out of a bad game and hope enough people buy on day one.

8542201,0,t1_d68ejin,Looks like standard game development to me. They made a product they advertised the product and now they are going to release that product. Every game these days have day  patches. The only thing the patch being this big means is they went gold with a far earlier build than normal. The sheer amount of content in that patch is such that it literally had to take months to do. This isnt about passion. This is about business. Im sure some passion is in there but lets not get deluded about the standard way things have been working for years and how this fits nicely into that same exact mold.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d69cekm,2,t5_325lr

Any actual changes and such to the planet is stored only locally. In that way finding a planet after someone else is exactly like finding a new planet except it has a different name.Now that said they probably could store every place that has been explored.

8543211,1,t3_4ws8rc,What do you want me to say? Dont worry honey everyone was playing a big joke. The game is super duper fun! No in all honestly you may hate this game. You may love this game. I nor can any other person commenting has the ability to tell what youre going to feel about the game. Personally Im sold on what Ive seen. There is enough to justify the  and it seems the devs are dedicated enough to keep pumping out updates. Now that more or less may change in the coming months but well have to see. EDIT Here is an example I threw at a friend the other day. I see No Mans Sky compared more to like beating the single player story of Grand Theft Auto but continuing to play the games sandbox features purely because that environment shit is fun. The story is done with the climax is gone. Youre just a player in a giant large sandbox free to do whatever the game lets you.No Mans Sky isnt trying to become the next Elite Dangerous. Its not supposed to be a heavy duty space simulator. Its more a chill and relax game you can put on for a few hours and burn some hours away.

There was no sign of any end to that endeavor so I closed the map and returned to the game.

It is quite similar in the space dogfighting but the complexity of navigating with everything thats going on in NMS would make for a more wild VR experience. To be clear though I was trying to write my reply in a disorienting fashion as an entertainment point haha. Its actually very doable and although it would be more challenging in VR I like that. Despite some reports to the contrary I think its very likely this will receive support for PSVR and it should. Itll make the game twice as immersive and fun.

When player B goes to the same planet his PS uses the seed to generate another personal instance of that planet. The instances are not linked other than things people might name and there is no networking code allowing someone to be in someone elses instance.No matter how many times someone dies and reloads the game they are never going to be able to meet up.Its just so unbelievably silly to me that people still think the game has full networkingmultiplayer support but that its hidden behind some sort of FIRST you have to be lucky enough to beat the astronomical odds and end up in the same system.

AAA titles cost  because there are hundreds of people working on them and money has to be split between all of those employees. Imho Hello Games would make much more money with NMS being  in its current state more copies sold bc of a price decrease.

Its even likely that they expected it to be live at release hence all of the talk about it but had some trouble preventing them from doing it. Either delay the game or just hope to get it working before its an issue.

Ive had the exact same moment that you quoted   recognizing that its a good game but its just not the game for me.

8561601,0,t3_4x1xuv,Oh man I did that yesterday on my rd discovered planet so all the game mechanics were new to me. I almost restarted my game but was determined to try to get myself off the planet. Luckily it was a pretty lush planet full of life so I wandered for  hours trying to find a way to get off.Good news is that there is always a way and I loved the feeling of being stranded on a strange planet. Heres what I didI wondered around for hours looking for a crashed ship but came across a beacon. I crafted the key to use it and discovered a small base with a landing strip. I walked for  minutes to the base and waited for people to land to see if I could buy a ship I found some but they were too expensive. Damn. I then see an option to call my ship at the strip. I try but it tells me my ship is still damaged. Damn. I then walk  minutes back to repair it and then head back to the base... Im lost and cant find it since the world is so huge.I seek another beacon and find another base like  minutes away I get there and call my ship with success and can finally fly away. I felt so accomplished beating out a glitch without restarting my game. One thing is clear they always have a way you can leave you just might have to take a detour journey and fight off strange creatures along the way.Thats when I realized I loved this game.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6bs016,2,t5_325lr

Buildings aliens ships space stations and stuff like that were modeled but everything else is just run through the algorithm as needed and is only stored as those variables when not loaded. Having all the models saved would make the game file massive probably impossibly large by todays standards but having just the algorithms raw variables and a few modeled assets would take up just a fraction of the space but probably much more intense on the CPU.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6chwbk,2,t5_325lr

Or they do for a set amount of time and then they stop supporting the game which means any other bugs that are left are left for good. That the game already has this many gamebreaking bugs is kind of an indicator that there might be a lot more people will run into  but then its also a relatively simple game so maybe not.Also to compare No Mans Sky to Pokemon Go is a little ridiculous. Pokemon Go is a free game  you can pay for items and such but the game itself is free to play.

8571246,0,t1_d6czduu,I completely agree. I think its a bit mad to expect  developers to put time and effort into adding real multiplayer systems when the hundreds at DICE cant even get it perfect when they expected the chance of anyone meeting anyone to be so ridiculously small.  The addition of the scan for players feature does make it much more likely that real multiplayer will come though.

Devs make a choice to not make it hardcore so you just rebound off stuff. DEVS ARE STOOPID MAKE THE GAME I WANT.Nope sure as fuck sounds like you were an idiot. Dont preorder games man.

8576820,0,t1_d6dblwc,Naw see heres the thing Theres an unknowable component to this unless you are in the company itself. A developer saying a feature will be in the game knowing it wont be and lying to the public VS saying a feature will be in the game and at the last minute having to ditch on the feature to make launch is impossible for the general public to parse. Unless the developer says exactly what happened which they never do. So given radio silence from the developer between the two possible scenarios some will jump to the conclusion that Sean is a lying sack of shit deceitful untrustworthy developer. But the public cant ever know the truth. All they know a promise wasnt kept. Thats not a lie. Theres a difference. And no Im sorry but their reputation is forever tarnished is not true. Theres only ONE thing that matters in the game industry whether you made an awesome game or not. Thats it. You can be the biggest shitbag but if you put out insanely good games then it doesnt matter. You live and die by how good the game is. Thats all. Nothing else. Unfortunately for sean NMS as a whole isnt an amazing game so his reputation will tarnish. If NMS was so goddamn good anyways the little promise not kept wouldnt matter. Ive heard this from so many people that are butthurt about devs walking away from promises. Its a gamer dream.

8577573,0,t1_d6djulk,I did think of that but ran out of time to try it. Honestly not all that worried. I may try to go back to my ship and do a running jump with jet pack to see if I can reach it. I also was thinking about stacking jet pack upgrades to see if I can get enough fuel to make it to the ship. It would suck to restart as I found a good place I think. Planets with lots of silica plutonium gold aluminum etc... but if I have to oh well. Still worried I wont get the warp drive blue prints as I claimed my ship right away but I was able to accept atlas help so I think I am on track for the tutorial still.

8583964,0,t1_d6ejl2s,Although its not guaranteed that there is MP at this point aside from what Sean Murray has said it think this is fairly solid logic for how such a multiplayer system would be implemented. They could be being silent about this because they want to make sure the feature is absolutely working before making another statement because there might be another shitstorm. Its also entirely likely they shut off their multiplayer because of server issues. They may have been sending something like location updates for every player in the game. Since their servers werent ready to handle the load they turned off the location updates until they get it all working. This would be VERY similar to what happened with Niantic and Pokmon Go. Or they may have not determined the issue yet and are keeping silent until they figure it out. Or they could be living... Which seems so incredibly unlikely after getting all of that press attention about the game. This would kill their trust with consumers and limit future succeses quite a bit. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6ekyg6,4,t5_325lr

Low budget games should have lower prices.If the devs make a good game they will make a shit ton of money selling a large quantity. Just look at Minecraft. Notch is probably the richest game dev out there and he didnt have to sell his game for ...If the devs make a bad game they will make a small amount of money but still enough to pay the wages of all their employees.This is why indie games should never be .If they make a bad game  is reasonable and people may still buy it. If they make a good game  in millions of sales is still a shit ton of profit for a small dev team. Again look at Minecraft.No Mans Sky saw the game was overhyped to all fuck.

FPS locks to fps.It seems like thes framecounting system is wrong.Use borderless mode dont use fullscreen. Im monitoring my GPU usage and it seems the lag spike is from memory usage spikes.Edit Not borderless! Bordered! Borderless fps was running at K see edit. Bordered fpsEdit Set FPS lock to FPS. Im running  GPU load.Edit Bordeless is fine just it uses your monitors DESKTOP RESOLUTION. Change your resolution before using borderless.Edit Changing resolution caused flickering. In Nvidia Control Panel changing Scaling to perform on GPU not Display fixed issue.Edit Changed resolution borderless Vsync On Frame limit set to MAX. Running at a cool fps with  CPU load. VRAM bottleneck lag is still there though.Edit Disabling FXAA might be better but im not entirely sure. Probably placebo. Opening the inventory can drop the fps for a bit. There seems to be loading hitches when scanning and changing areas. I disabled my internet thinking it was internet related and it still happens. Nothing too major though. It never locks up or lags more than a second and when it happens is predictable.Final settings  Borderless x Vsync On AntiAliasing FXAA OnFoot FOV  Flight FOV  Anistropic Filtering x Texture High Shadow Ultra Generation Detail High Reflection Quality High Hud On Max FPS MaxIve played this on the PS already and PC blows it away completely. Better framerate better FOV. Im willing to start all over again because this looks and feels amazing.Edit Ill stream for a bit Edit Thanks for those that tuned in. If you saw some FPS drops with intensive parts that was probably because I was using software encoder for fps. The gameplay was smooth for me. That said I made sure to showcase where it lags scanning entering loadzones finding buildings nearing space stations entering atmosphere and sometimes opening inventory to ship screen. If you have a good machine the FPS drops arent an issue. Id honestly trade a  second hiccup for no load screen and they happen predictably. It wont happen during a dogfight or shooting.Just wanted to add I had no crashes and alttabbed a lot to check GPU load configure OBS and chat on Twitch.Edit Remade this into its own post.

And then I said fuck it if my FPS is unchanged I may as well play on the best graphics. Now I got  FPS... Great. Bare in mind I had to restart the game every time I did this too.

That shit is really childish when the majority of this comes down to people not running compatible hardware. There are still a few issues outside of that and they were being actively addressed within minutes of the game releasing.

8589887,0,t1_d6fajz5,for me wandering around discovering shit IS a huge mechanic. Im a sucker for massive open world games. I mean this was always pitched as an exploration game with other bits really being secondary to that. It also has crafting res collecting trade combat etc.I do not particularly like online multiplayer games so COD for my use has very little gameplay. playing the same few maps a thousand times just doesnt appeal to me.destiny would be a game I feel had less than NMS because the online matchmaking and such doesnt do it for me. You can upgrade your suit and gun sure but end game everyone has basically the same level shit to keep it even and you are basically just replaying the same  or so missions a ton. That to me is not really gameplay depth.Basically just because you like doing the same thing in the same place over and over in one game and do not in this one does not to me equal depth.i get why you feel that way I just respectfully disagree.This was basically the game they pitched to us and it is phenomenal to me.

8589914,0,t1_d6f0zp9,I will repostIm liking the game overall but there are a number of shortcomings that can be huge turn offs for some. On the PS stability is a big issue.Gameplay is repetitive. Most planets have life which makes findingnaming it not very special. They start seeming very similar in scope after the first few and each planet is one biometopography... so if you land in one spot and do a  youve seen the whole thing mostly.Besides wandering critters on planets there are no more lifeforms other than the static lone alien in an outpost ship or space station.... Oh and most planets and all systems seem to have already been discovered by these species and by annoying robots. Theres no civilizations on planets just a smattering of samelooking isolated structures and alien monoliths those are neat.Trade system is very rudimentary more like just vendor junking rather than trading.Some arguably poor design choices like no actual suns theyre sky boxes very pastel colored outer space that blurs planetsstars no gas giants planets are kind of close together gravity is always same etc. Im still liking it so far... but as of now in my opinion the gameplay isnt deep enough to compensate for its flaws in the long term. Im curious to see how they seek to improve it. The biggest letdown is that there seems to be this beautiful foundation and were given so few tools to build our story upon it.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6fbuf1,1,t5_325lr

Didnt bother with Borderless and stayed with FullScreen.So I still stay rock hard at  for lowest FPS. When theres a hitch the frame rate plummets but its only for a second or two. Once I left my starting planet and went to a nearby moon I began to have a few instances where I jumped to  FPS for a few moments.Ive read elsewhere that even having adaptive vsync can hobble your FPS so Ill try that next.

8591588,0,t1_d6fc3q7,No Mans Sky isnt having problems because PC gaming is some kind of mystery its because Hello Games switched focus to the PS version thanks to Sonys money and they didnt properly optimize and test the PC release.And personally Im running the game fine after changing the max fps setting.

8591701,0,t3_4xhm95,First of all it was not made as a PC game. Its a PS game to the bones all the game files are PSAR PlayStation ARchives its pretty much a port I think.Second of all they are a  man studio. Its pretty obvious they focused on PS probably because of their deal with Sony and did not have resources to deal with PCs limitless configuration options. I see people with beastly machines like GTX  or whatever reporting lower framerates than I experience with my old  which is below listed minimum requirements!. And then some others with s reporting butter smooth gameplay. Its weird.All in all I feel for the people who are disappointed. I really do. But I myself couldnt be happier with it. Game runs better than I expected its mind blowingly awesome and I cant wait to play it more. But its  AM and my month old son needs his diaper changed while my wife tries to sleep so its break time for me.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6fjwwj,2,t5_325lr

If this was Molyneux  Hed have been saying how the player will be developing a personal connection with their planet and it will grow and change over time. And how the whole galaxy will respond to the players actions. Hed say you could start a family on an alien homestead doing manual alien labor in the alien forest for credits. Peter would tell you how the game is going to connect people in a new way and make them question the nature of the universe all over again.  Hed say that there would be massive city centers with animate and expressive alien races that each dynamically interact with the player character.  Then itd be released and wed get the current state of the game. If youre comparing the two guys Id say Murray is worlds better than Molyneux was.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6fmrdz,2,t5_325lr

The game had a very positive score for the first hour or so of release on steam until people who couldnt even get into the game got upset. Definitely a good game but definitely had a terrible launch and the amount of bugs and issues such as claiming the preorder ship early fucking you over are frankly appalling that a game in development for  years is so badly tested and optimized.

Remove the flight deck on planets allowing us to skim the surface...even if it costs us dearly. We dont even need a crash animation just give us a black screen of death if we fly stupid.

8597175,0,t3_4xkrjk,I think the reason it would be cool in this game as opposed to other games like assassins creed or whatever is that the game itself is what lead them to realize they were next to each other whereas in other single player games they would have to already be communicating.its a small thing sure and they did have to communicate outside of the game to actually get to the same spot but the original reason one of them realized they were there was because they saw a discovery that had just happened.

8597416,0,t3_4xiift,Gravitino Balls or Albumen Pearls. Find a planet that has sentinels on high alert like labeled aggressive or frenzied. Those planets have rare resources that when you pick them up you are attacked. My strategy is to get attacked and bait the sentinels into calling backup. From what I can tell once you kill the last wave of sentinels that has the big biped walker they will never attack you again unless you leave the planet. Then Im free to farm anything I want in peace. I used the Gravitino Ball stacking trick which you can deconstruct a ship item that has Gravitino Balls and if you dont have enough slots open it will stack the balls. Then you can stack them to .I also like the Albumen Pearls which are found in caves because they are found so close together. Sometimes hundreds in a cave. I think its faster to farm Pearls than Balls. If youre feels exploity you can also do the ship inventory duplication trick where you die in space then reload two save games back and your corpse is still there with the items as well as your original inventory. If you had a stack of Gravitino Balls this could net you tens of millions of units very very quickly. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6g9ov5,1,t5_325lr

Because the lay person isnt actually a trained or experienced tester their bug reports arent usually that useful but the hardware reports and system generated crash dumps are.  It does however take a pretty large backend setup to deal with and lots more prep time for a beta product and automatic reporting that is unlikely to be part of the final product so this kind of set up is out of reach for smaller developers.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6gv8aw,1,t5_325lr

8613949,0,t3_4xtnwu,I started off deciding to be a trader.  I left my first system as soon as I could eager to explore.  I didnt even bother figuring out how to scan things at that point.I drifted from planet to planet occasionally finding cool wildlife or breathtaking views.  I mined a lot of nickel.  Finally I discovered a pair of planets that have me purpose.  Theres Asmodeus  a barren rocky hells ape with smoking tulips and some trees that look like Oblivion Gates.  Aside from those and what looked like petrified onions the surface was barren.  In the caves though were tons of crystals Radnox and the realization that the onions topside seemed to be petrified eggs.  The eggs in the caves were very much alive and filled with Albumen Pearls.  Excited to finally make a big score I loaded up on pearls and headed out to find someone willing to pay for them.Someone eventually did but before that happened I ran into a planet that I blindly named Super Mario World in the blindly named Nintendo Entertainment System.  The first creature on Super Mario was a jumping mushroom.  I named it Goomba and chuckled to myself.  And was then set upon by some sort of elephantsized scooting lettuce creature.  And it just got weirder from there.  Nothing on the planet had legs and everything seemed to either be a fungus a jelly or a mobile plant.  The wildlife was thick too so it was a completely bizarre experience after seeing mostly Space Deer and Space Badgers.

Its also hilariously stupid that freelook only seems to work if you plug in a controller. Luckily you can use both at the same time without having to be dedicated to one so I just sit the controller on my lap until I fly. This game is alright its good in many ways but I will never hold back on criticism for the consoleport feeling this game gives off. A fuckin console port in  give me a break.

It does drop the price but the last time I did this the upgrades the new one had on it were upgrades I didnt have available to make myself yet so it might not be worth it to do this. Also if you find an alien that gives you a new multitool you can reload a save to see if they offer something differently. I bought an upgrade from the station  slot and then the alien gave me one  slot. I tried to reload my save to save the k or whatever I paid for the one upgrade and the new gun was .

8614797,0,t3_4xu3nq,Problem assets world geometry etc. cant be drawn all the time its too expensive. Theres no reason to draw geometry when the player cant see it. Therefore geometry and world assets are rendered when the player gets close enough to see it.There are four ways you can do this Pop in geometry. This is the way it used to work. The problem is that the pop is very noticeable. So they switched it to... Dithering it in. This results in the grainy look youre complaining about but it does cover the pop in basically youre popping in individual pixels instead of the entire object. If you dont like the way that looks then you can... Alpha it in. This means that objects would slowly fade in. Its a lot less visible. The problem here though is that its roughly twice as expensive as the previous two systems basically to keep track of the alpha youre having to draw each item twice. Youd end up with fewer object or lower framerate unless you go with... Fog. Basically have a distance fog and make sure that objects and world geometry pop in before theyre visible. The problem here is that every world has to have distance fog and the further it is away from the player the bigger the distance youll have to pop things in at.So there you go Pop Dither Fewer objects or Fog. Which would you prefer?Source am game developer.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6ig48r,1,t5_325lr

8624596,0,t3_4xkj1w,I think the overall HUD and UI is awful. If you look at earlier trailers the UI is co crisp and clean. When you enter the atmosphere of a planet it used to say the name in the center of your screen and tell you the levels of gases in the air. Just take a look at the HUD here  and now take a look at your in game HUD. The way planets names are shown through the black box isnt pretty either. I understand that this may fall as a completely unimportant part of the game but its the little things that matter. If what youre looking at consistently is somewhat dull or boring it drags the game down with it. Even the way you analyse creatures. You now have to zoom in on them to analyse which is annoying anyway because its resulted in lots of irritating things like not being able to scan birds half the time but once again if you look in the trailer he scans when he sees a creature and he discovers it. The name even pops up next to the creature and it just adds to whole beauty of NMS. Now it comes up in a back line in shitty font just on your screen looking pretty damn unattractive. Like I said I understand that people may not see this as an important feature but its amazing how much this affects your game experience. I really hope Hello Games can redo the entire UI and make it much more appealing. I just wanted to make these suggestions as even though the crashes and stuff need to be fixed first this could still be addressed as well.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6jodir,1,t5_325lr

8629237,0,t1_d6k6xtw,More powerful? Yes the photon cannon wins hands down. Better? probably not....I have both fully upgraded with all upgrades currently available and the autotargeting timetillimpact and range on the mining laser make space combat easy mode. Its literally instant autotargeted damage at insane range.Dont get me wrong they both have their uses and the mining laser is expensive to use as you pointed out. I often use the photon cannon to spray fire over an area as the hostile ships are warping in and then switch to mining laser for easy kills.When responding to a distress call the laser is great for picking up the targets at long range you dont even have to aim. If Im low on resources I will agro the ships with the laser and then finish with the cannon otherwise its just two cycles on the laser and they are dead before they can turn to start firing on me.Honestly I kind of hope they nerf the mining laser because its almost too easy.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6k9cl4,1,t5_325lr

You can imagine something like     var Au        atomicWeight  its actually .      Au or gold doesnt have a mass of  so this is a redesign of the periodic table. Now Im not saying they redesigned gold but this is my interpretation of something that happened based on what they meant to saygt create atmospheric particles that would diffract light at just the right wavelength.This part is somewhat true since the planets are generated using a math equation similiar to a Sine wave.

Whether you like the game regardless of all that its not something gaming community should accept. A few small details changing during the developement is understandable but not on this scale.I agree that at this point doing an open AMA in reddit wouldnt really achieve much except skyrocket pitchfork sales but completely ignoring the critique and practically disappearing from public isnt a good way to handle it either.

Do you have something invested in its enjoyment?cold hazard and heat hazard were present and draining my protection  thats what i was doing on the planet yesterday. Was fun alright.    Okay how was this fun exactly?   You ran into a cave and your suit went haywire?   Maybe interesting but not necessarily fun.Tell me why exactly Korvax in the game have among other words one can learn of their language the slavery word? What this race of electronic beings highly scientific in nature has to do with slavery? Whats the connection and where and when exactly some Korvax speak about slavery? You dont know? Neither do i. But i intend to find out. While you is doing that....Really since there is no back story about the Korvax no one really knows but I would assume they are fighting the Gek race over territory and resources.   I learned over  Gek words and it required a simple carbon exchange with a random alien OVER and OVER and OVER again.   Some of them I found at temples and knowledge stones but you can learn by repetitive actions.   This really isnt that fun to me.   You should have more interaction with aliens besides the same exchange over and over again dont you think?See its not the games problem. Its your problem. This is not the usual AAA which takes your hand and grabs your hair if i might add and leads you through all the interesting content literally forcing you not to miss anything which is supposedly cool. Nope. NMS is not that. You do need to read things you do have to make certain efforts and you do need to observe and make conclusions about whats what.There are many puzzles and sentences you need to read to figure out what you are doing but they repeat themselves which is not very fun or interesting.   The text could have a few more ideas sentences and exchanges to make it a bit more robust.  I understand that it is not a linear game with a set path but it also doesnt have enough content to make it as fun as it could be which seems to be a general consensus from what I am reading from other players.I understand you love the game but dont let the beauty of its landscapes and vistas cloud your sense of what is fun and interesting to most people playing an adventureexploration game.

Get the type of ship I want think Im done here too unless something WOW pops up.  Along those lines the quest for a better ship sees me do the GEK tower trick and reveal about  crashes per solar system.  I say solar system because its my belief that the ship types in a solar system are sort of locked..  Trying to figure out how to get the Atlas Pass V and V.Thats it for now.  Oh and for me the whole Atlas getting to the center isnt even on my radar.  Sure I follow path and talk to the guys but thats about it.

8638166,0,t1_d6lb0wq,OK I see what you mean now with your argument  youre not arguing against the bigger issues in the game but youre picking on the smaller targets. Those I agree with you on. There is snow there are large creatures. Fair enough. Youre right its a problem... that people are constantly arguing that X isnt in the game when it really is. Are you aware of the much bigger issues that are omitted? Or some of the smaller ones? The distinction is between the smaller problems like the things OP mentioned by the way OPs post is weak and the really huge problems which you will agree with. Please see this post  for a full list. Yes some things in there arent perfect but most are.In fact let me ask you a question that exposes how ridiculous your argument is so in previous version of the game ships were shown to have transparent windows yeah? It added a nice little touch and made things feel more immersive and alive. In these kinds of games its the small details that count. However in the version I bought from Hello Games the windows are fully blacked out. So lets take your argument. If I was using your logic then the simple rebuttal is legendaryjordan there are many many ships in the game. I mean loads. Too many to count. You shouldnt rule out transparent windows on ships just because you havent seen it yet. Maybe someone HAS seen it in their game. Maybe you just havent seen it. Do you know how many ships there are? Loads. They are randomly generated too. You havent seen all the ships so please dont rule out transparent windows. Its possible there is someone there without recording equipment even though PS and PC have a screenshot feature and you just havent seen them YET.Yes youd technically be correct but do you see how utterly useless this reasoning is? I havent seen all of the ships available there are loads of ships it is a huge galaxy but all that means nothing.The main issue I see in what you are arguing about is that you think that just because there are  quintillion planets that we have really only explored a very small part of the game. No offence to you you really really dont understand how the game works if you think that. They did not code crashed freighters to happen one in every billion planets nor did they code it for one in every  million planets or  planets or  trillion planets or even  in every  planets. Thats simply not how the game works. So to sum up I agree with you on the smaller points of course I do. Snow is in the game and I guess monoliths could be considered big structures as could portals although its stretching it a little bit. There are water worlds and some rivers have been observed although they are rare. But! there is so much more that youre forgetting hasnt been included  and while hasnt been seen YET doesnt really need to be for the point to stand.p.s. to answer your question about working portals there is code in the game to show a button press and that it can be scanned however there is no code showing that it can be operated. Furthermore your point about why leave the code in  as far as I am aware they do often leave a lot of redundant codes in there like you suggested. The reason for the likely omission of portals is that they became useless due to resources becoming more available in the game for example monoliths buildings transmission towers etc. are everywhere but once upon a time in earlier development they were not thus making portals useful. They dont even come up on the scanner. The game was rushed towards the end. Please read that post I linked to It couldnt be any more obvious that there is so much that isnt in the game. Cant agree with you any more about certain things being in the game that individual people just havent found yet and are blindly moaning.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6ldnnb,1,t5_325lr

8638389,0,t1_d6l3ahm,There is an almost infinite amounts of virtual walkabouts on alien planets while cataloging strange Pokemons if that is what a person want to do its here and its more that can be done in a human lifetime.Im not trying to beat it thats why I spent  hours on my first planet far from trying to  anything I left when the planet was boring to me. The game is shallow  The lore written by famous dude X  repeats fast   Words from huge initially epic monuments are the same as speaking to ppl or checking random lexicon  New technology available for me has been old tech the last  times Ive been told there is something new available. ie. Its simply a waste of time to talk to any standard aliens or checking any house content since there is nothing new there. So Im following atlas path Im landing on all planets in all systems along the path.ie. not trying to beat the game but tech is maxed out good enough while learning words. That is to shallow game. Thus exploration really needs to be emphasized in this game. There is very little game to do but cataloging planet names and florafauna.I dont mind I had read the reviews before buying this Ive gotten my moneys worth hour is cheap entertainment.Maybe this will be enhanced over time as other small indie games sometimes are even though usually the go the early access route. So maybe it will be fun to play through again. But no more money for it no way.

8645196,0,t3_4y9601,Black holes always send you at least around  up to  ly from what I have seen personally. Once you completed the atlas path you should now be able to see the black holes on the galactic map. Hitting a black hole every warp with full warp drives Im currently at  ly from the center and I was at  earlier today probably about  hours.  Fill your inventory with the necessary resources to repair the warp drives.  A tip for those rare metals LegitAsteroids. Aluminum and Emeril seem to be the rarest in space but you can find ALL of those rare metals just floating around. There seems to be only  different types per system so just take a quick look each jump.Sort of feels not legit but works better. Find broken ships on planets . Empty your inventory into your current ship make sure to hop in your ship and SAVE before this in case something goes wrong.. Compare and switch ships WITHOUT transferring anything. DO NOT get into the other ship this will create a new save.. Now dismantle everything on the broken ship and move into your personal inventory.Now switch back to your original ship and you have a bunch of good resources.  This is assuming you have good equipment installed better equipment  better resources crashed ships inventories and  of slots are based on your current ship.Considering warping to a black hole plus the black hole one warp with an average of ly at ly remaining it would take about  warps.  I admit I think that is still a bit much but its doable.  And as for the zoom on ps I have no idea about that either. One time I flew out to the edge and saw no stars anymore  but didnt feel like going farther to see how long it would take to zoom out if thats how you do it.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6m9ebs,1,t5_325lr

What I dont like is items that dont stack that should like the loot from the sentinels chips and the orbs you pick up or fuel cell that you craft. They dont need to be  like the other resources but they should stack at least .Also dont like you you gotta go into the inventory to recharge shields in space in the middle of a dog fight it needs a hotkey.But those are subjective opinions based complaints.

8654601,0,t3_4yablp,I agree and I feel bad for both people who purchased that game. However I still cant believe people complain about any decentlysized game that costs  indie or otherwise especially when you factor in inflation. Historically games have remained around the same value for the last  years even though game development costs have increased dramatically for the same period. Even when accounting for inflation here game development is a more expensive process than it ever has before. I feel that we are lucky that games have remained relatively inexpensive base price when compared to the amount of entertainment we can reap from them. While I dont condone overly priced DLCSeason Passes for ultimately minute details being added to a game there a certainly a few entertainment industries whose costincreases have been far worse.

8655240,0,t1_d6nhzdk,In Minecraft the game evolves because you build  you create unique changes to your environment that persist and add value and depth to your world. In No Mans Sky you dont even have a compass or map or control over waypoints to find the same location or star again.The gameplay could evolve by having a more fleshed out faction rep system with longer progression. The npcs could send you out to gather data from specific worlds or defeat pirates in a nearby system. They would reward you with rare materials warp fuel units blueprints etc. The environmental hazards could be a lot more harsh and the rare resources could actually be rare. As it stands theres nothing stopping you from going to the most extreme planets right away theres no sense of progress of accomplishment in doing so.A fundamental problem is that the gameplay on every planet is almost exactly the same they have the exact same features and interactions. If there was more content then you could find different kinds of activities from planet to planet to break up the monotony. Right now you can see  of the game on your first planet it kind of deflates the prospect of exploring.See? Its really not hard to come up with basic ideas for actual content depth.

So mentioning features that were removed or saying anything that could turn potential customers away he was legally obliged to keep quiet about. This would also explain why he was so vague on the multiplayer as point blank coming out an saying its not possible an not in the game would effectively hurt potential sales so he had to beat around the bush a lot.

The Atlas pass v opens the door opposite the normal door in space stations and gives access to exosuit upgrade slot in each station.The debris contain one of the yellow items used to make warp cells ive gotten all  items out of them used to make the warp cells.

See the Steam sale page or any other storefront playing those old trailers that do not even remotely reflect the real product. That person who personally created the false expectations of certain features still refuses to confirm or deny the existence in the final product of said features.

Please look at the sources for this too on my link. There are multiple occasions of this. Not just one throwaway statement like you are trying to say multiple different occasions of this being advertised through interviews.gtHuh? At what point was this promise made? Besides Im pretty sure a few days ago someone posted a gif of random walking sentinel.Dont try to muddy the waters by using the word promise. It was shown on gameplay videotrailer. I believe that GIF was a mod.gtCurrently a major bug. Not only indoors.Fair enough.gtThis was never advertised. The scene with the bigass rhino that moved trees was due to its size. If you check ingame animals moving through grass  bushes make them move. Two things. One Ive seen big creatures that do not move trees and furthermore you can walk right through animals.gtIndeed this one kinds blows. But its the only legit one so far.You do make me laugh. Please address the loss of physics on a planet in relation to the solar system. I understand the game is not a sim game but Sean Murray talked about planets having an axis however the current understanding is that after some play testers said this was disorientating they omitted it. This could be an excuse.The most embarrassing one though is how he called out other devs on the fact that nearly all games have clear sky boxes and this was a limitation in many games. Well NMS indeed have sky boxes too so Sean Murray is a complete hypocrite for this statement.

8682185,0,t1_d6qv8a5,I am in no way denying that there was some fucked up and unfortunate series of events that led to the released version of the game compared to the expected version like in the E trailer.Comparatively the released version does really look like a different game and it wasnt fair to say it was random planet that they went to for the trailer because it does look too good to be true so it must be scripted which it was. If you had no expetations then the released version is still a good game with some features that were definitely there at one point cut due to whatever reasons. Its not going to be enoyable for everyone but for the people that do enjoy it its a great addition to the game library wether youre on Ps or Pc to be enjoyed along other games.I believe that the devs were under a hell of a lot more pressure than they thought they would have to deal with and it severely affected the final outcome of the game.

Blooming making squares is more effective than linear stacking because you get more touches per item per upgrade.

It sounds a lot like Niantic though and their poor communication with the Pokemon Go community. Fans were riled up about broken things the game had originally offered and Niantic gave zero response for about a month causing their game to suffer a huge amount of hate and refunds. They have since become much more open with the community about what they are doing and the community seems to more or less be willing to give them a second chance.

8707248,0,t1_d6u12kx,Dude.gtYou may have noticed that with max warp drive upgrades you can warp just over  light years but you only ever seem to get  ly closer to the center? Thats because Hello Games presumably because they didnt want people to be able to beat the game in under  hours ninja nerfed the players starting position and galaxy size with a day patch. The players true starting distance is not  light years from center. Its actually  times that or k ly from center. This is why when you make a linear jump of  ly you only ever move  closer to the center factor of . This also means that the optimal way to get to the center is to warp as close to  ly towards center as you can while also hitting a black hole which moves you a real value of  towards the center or the equivalent of  in displayed values.gtThis day patch also had the terrible side effect of destroying the pacing of the game. With the original intended pacing players would likely max out everything with around kk light years left on their journey just in time to enjoy their god mode status on the home stretch of their journey.gtNow players max out with a displayed value of k light years a real value of k light years which is still well over x the actual intended starting distance of the player from the center.

About  minutes later and all Ive come across are about  additional drop pods which were all useless because my next upgrade cost  units. I had a ton of resources to sell so that I could upgrade my exosuit but no way to turn those resources into units to use on all of the drop pods I was coming across.

8715413,0,t1_d6v1pwj,gt Something amazing is based on perspective. What you consider to be something amazing and what your grandma does are two very different things. Perhaps new game plus IS something amazing to hello games.New Game Plus is a fairly common thing in gaming. Common things by definition are not amazing.gt Perhaps as some have theorized no one has ACTUALLY reached the center.Entirely possible but if thats the case the game and developers should still be taken to task for a not making this clear and b not making it clear what steps are necessary to get the ball rolling. I dont have a problem with puzzles but we dont even know if it is a puzzle. Thats bad design.gt  Nada hints at this repetitive simulation. Even calls it illogical citing that it doesnt make sense. When she does Polo laughs. Perhaps he knows something he isnt letting onto. Im aware of this text but again there is no indication from the game that this actually means anything. A person cant solve a puzzle if they dont know that theres a puzzle to solve. If the game wants the true center to be a big puzzle for players to solve then the game needs to actually give some indication that thats the case. gt  Maybe its because he wants you to figure it out for yourself. This is about as shortsighted as me typing arfheauofhajfnasdjklfndjkfhnsdjkfdjksahffk. You might say its gibberish but maybe I just want you to figure it out for yourself.You have absolutely no bearing there. You have no place to start no idea what youre even trying to accomplish. As far as you can tell all I did was type gibberish at you.Now if I said Perhaps theres a message here suddenly you have a goal and an idea where to start. I certainly havent solved the puzzle for you but Ive at least indicated that a a puzzle exists and b there is at least one rule that it is governed by translation. Puzzles dont work if players dont know they exist. If No Mans Sky is a puzzle it has done a very poor job of communicating that to the players especially since good puzzles by their very nature rely on mechanics that can be easily tested. Thats why Rivens puzzles were bad  because you had to flip a switch spend an hour running across the island then find the doodad to see if anything changed. There was no way to easily understand what you were trying to accomplish or how one mechanic affected another. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6v2cfu,1,t5_325lr

Interactions are boring and repetitive.Itd be cool to see this game be mixed with Destiny. The thing I didnt like about Destiny was the lack of planets. Everything is so advanced but you can only play in our solar system. If the games were combined that would be insane.Also as some have mentioned the crashing is bad but did get a bit better after the patches.Also the lack of upgrades theyre shallow doesnt take long to have all of them for the multitool suit and ship.You cant plasma launcher your way to the centre of a planet not sure why.I like games with quests things to do interactions and theyve put together an entire universe and theres minimal interactions. Where are the humanlike species? Only ?Also it would be cool if you could build stuff on the planets or space stations or anything really. All the resources are there why not be able to build a station have your own solar system that you have to defend?Why are there slot limitations? Ships cant get bigger? I saw giant freighters why cant I get or build one of those?Why cant you modify your ship? Your multitool? Your exosuit? Why is it limited to like  different but similar as per category upgrades?Why cant I build a hangar and collect ships? Multitools?You cant sell ships exosuits and multitools only buy them?Have a home solar system to warp out of?So the game is extremely broad but also extremely shallow.

So you can basically say to your friend Hey lets play Deus EX together then open up the game like him and you together play in your singleplayer environment completely alone but call it mulitplayer since you both play the same mission in the same level together. This is basically what nomans sky does with the added effect of players being able to name a handful of game elements which will definitely be sent to some kind of central server so clients can pull those inofrmation out to incorporate it into the singleplayer game.

So when will Intel cards work with No Mans Sky? Probably a few generations of Intel cards into the future.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6wd29d,1,t5_325lr

8727422,0,t1_d6wg0n7,TLDR this lawsuit would probably be regarded as frivolous if you want to pursue Truth in Advertising breach then complain to the FTC and hope they do something the most youll get is your purchase price back and you can probably get it easier and quicker through a refund from the retailer.The basic premise of any civil lawsuit is I am injured financially or otherwise I believe it is your fault and you should pay for it here is the extent of my damages and here is the proof. The court examines your evidence listens to your arguments and the defendants arguments and decides who owes what to whom.Generally you can recover what you paid. Extra money is only awarded if there is good cause for it. For example you experienced pain and suffering or you lost wages or you missed profits and you have to prove that.So you get together a class action lawsuit against Hello Games asking specifically for... what?Essentially you want to say Hello Games deceived me I want my money back right?OK  go get a refund.But Steam wont refund after  hours.Thats not Hello Games problem. You chose to buy through Steam you agreed to their refund policies. If you didnt you could have gone to a different retailer with different return policies e.g. GOG.But Hello Games broke the Truth in Advertising rules.  OK you can make a complaint to FTC and maybe FTC will do something about it investigate it maybe levy a fine against Hello Games maybe force it to issue refunds  but that is done through a complaint not through a lawsuit.In any case the most youll get is your sixty bucks back. You were not sufficiently injured by missing features in the game to warrant extra compensation. And the sixty bucks can be obtained much easier by going through the refund process of your retailer if such process exists.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6wkjz7,1,t5_325lr

8727828,0,t1_d6wkezu,First of all there are just  distinct galaxies not  million.Second of all  if just finding a huge creature has such a low chance of happening that out of the hundreds of thousands of players nobody has been able to bring forward a proof of their existence then they have no business being part of the promotional material. Just like large fleets of freighters crashed freighters low orbit freighters sand snakes animals destroying trees or whatever else that nobody has been able to prove.And no things that people previously thought werent in the game are not being discovered every day. How many things have been found from that long list of missing features? ? And two of those were questionable.Lastly the argument of its a huge game! chances are really low.. etc. doesnt really hold up. Its a procedurally generated game and as such it has strict bounds on what it can create  its not random. Its being directed by algorithms that produce an output based on an input. But for the same input you have to get the same output. After a while it starts to be really obvious what the games limitations are and what patterns it can produce. At this point it is very reasonable to conclude that the vast majority of the missing features on the list are not in fact part of the game.So excuse me if I have a problem.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6wmdyr,0,t5_325lr

Having seen him in multiple interviews and introducing dos at the PSX show I did not read him the same way and disagree with your assessment.Unless you know the guy personally you really cant make an objective blanket assertion like that.  It borders on defamation of character and thats not right.  I dont have a problem with someone slating a corporation.  Dont even start me on Blizzard right now for instance.  Ill slate them myselves for their horrid support.  But attacking an individual like that based on a perception which may be unfounded is not cool.  I happen to think Saint Steve Jobs was a complete moneygrubbing prick but he at least bore that impression out over decades.  I dont think theres enough data on SM to come to any definitive conclusions.  Joe Danger  amp  are pretty much their only other two games and I dont think anyone complained about those or the company or SM before NMS.

I chalked up the lack of features making into the game as something that happened late in development due to things not quite working right and more bugs popping up as they did more QA. It would make sense because a lot features are either still within the game but not working portals or hinted at being there. I figured they were pressured to release in July realized they needed more time but instead of delaying  months and they quickly disabled a bunch of content so they could get it out. This has happened in projects Ive been apart of so I can sympathize. If they gimped giant fauna giant creatures draw distance etc. just have VR... Ill simply not buy another HG game.

8746975,0,t3_4zu3cz,I read a super defensive article in the first days after launch about how crap like base building shouldnt be in the game because your ship is your base. More than that its your home.You explore in your ship you fight in your ship and you accumulate a plethora of memories in your ship. Theres a level of sentiment to it that widened my eyes and eased me off the I wanna build bases on planets! bandwagon......until I realised I was abandoning my ship every three minutes for something better and all that sentimental crap goes out the window.I feel like if instead of completely replacing our ships we could straight up modify them both visually and functionally adding nacelles here engines there a fuselage or two and a sick paint job itd inspire a much more personal relationship between ship and pilot.Of course most ships dont care about relationships and since its only a game its not like youre forced to cherish your ship but think like Han Solo or something. He loves the Falcon and its because its his. He always has it. Hes not looking to replace it for something better first chance he gets. I wanna feel the same way. I dont wanna start anew with a strange ship every so often and have to drop the old one like a bad habit.I want to grow with the ship I start with not outgrow it.That said I wouldnt be eager for an insanely customisable system like Space Engineers has. Im not the most creative person in the world and Id still want my ship to look good without spending countless hours on one measly upgrade trying to make it aesthetically pleasing.There are plenty of ways to keep the system modular without making players do all the work. An example would be interchanging wings engines etc with differentlooking ones with a few positional options for if you dont like where parts such as the wings are or something. You could move them forward or backward along the body of the ship or angle them up or down even.Anyway...its just an idea. It wouldnt be the easiest thing in the world for the devs so Im not expecting anything like this to actually get added to game.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d6z0y9u,1,t5_325lr

This game release was so much bigger than a team of  could have ever handled on their own. Even teams and companies with more experience and better track records and whove hired people beforehand to handle community messaging have messed this up though so while theyve earned some of the scorn theyre receiving it really shouldnt be surprising if it is to anyone then the appropriate next step would be to adjust their internal model of the world they live in.And separately the volume and tenacity with which people are gnashing their teeth is really unproductive and a waste of their time. Equal good could be achieved by banging ones head against the nearest wall. Voicing ones discontent with someone whos in a position to do something to redress it is fine but beyond making ones voice heard pitchforks and mobs are little more than the stroking of ones own ego.

8774225,0,t1_d71kpaw,The problem with ships and multitools is the fact that its not worth to upgrade them before you get max slots. Why bother repairing tautheta techs on found crashed ships if you know that in  minutes you will find another transmission tower by exploring and you will change your ship again? Or the huge disappointment when you find you dream crashed ship but oh I dont have  slots so it will be inferior and I will change it for higher slot ship soon anywaynow its partially fixed with save editor. It would be great if there would be option to buy inventory slots to ship and multitools like it is with exo suit. I finally could enjoy exploring after I got my  setup because I could finally start upgrading things without oh but I will dismantle this in  minutes anyway thoughts. I finally felt more freedom and tech upgrades had more sense. Exo suit upgrades felt great I didnt grind them. But ships and multitools are pain. Theres that horrible feeling that what you have now it just temporary because you will have to change it for another model soon if you like it or not. Theres no oh I love that new shipmultitool I will upgrade its slots rather change it for another model even if it takes much more time than getting new model with more slots.

Space battles with  ships happen and you can join in them if you like to. I personally dont since Id die quite quickly butthere are people with maxed out ships who actually do partake.Insanely large ships here way bigger than your average freighter.Its really not hard to find posts about them aswell since there are quite many. I literally searched space battle in this subreddit and picked random posts. Read this for example. People are talking about how upgrading the engines makes ship movement way more enjoable and better. This takes me to the next pointgt Ship classesThis thread with everything explained had over k upvotes. Theres way more differences than just looks.I know that a lot of things couldve been better in the game but theres no reason to ignore the ones that already there and blatanly claim otherwise.Also I had no idea about resources are like atoms and you can build molecules that you can then use to build other things. The thing is though none of the initial trailers or gameplay videos showed anything like that. Just because someone found a small part of an interview with Sean saying that  years ago doesnt mean that you can literally combine atoms in the game.

At launch it was extremely rudimentary and even  or so MAJOR updates later we still didnt have horses. Yet Im sure if you asked the devs beforehand what they wanted you to be able to do in minecraft CE theyd tell you just about everything you can do on minecraft PC short of mods.Im viewing this as not a finished product and Im more than used to waiting for promised content thanks mojang.

8789720,0,t1_d74d1z1,gt What about jetpack gliding? It seems to me very unlikely that no one noticed it in prerelease play throughs by the devs so it was either an unintentional outcome and left in because it was fun or it was intentionally designed that way and we have just been assuming its a glitch since it was a lot wonkier at release.Id say chances are good that it was an unintentional outcome left in because it was fun. Floodlight  I didnt even know about that. Thats exactly the kind of thing Id say is a small surprising touch and one that adds to the immersion quite nicely.Only reason I wouldnt include radar and proximity bonuses is those were both known before and I would argue are core gameplay mechanics that the player is intended to use. But again different strokes different folks. PI definitely dont think it was a cash grab but I do think this is a case of either reach exceeding grasp or just really terrible communication. Weve got players who insist the game is meant to be a purely contemplative exploration experience despite Sony releasing EXPLORE FIGHT TRADE SURVIVE ads weve got mixed messages about multiplayer weve got a small group of people who are convinced the game is a puzzle box waiting to be opened which is a whole problem in and of itself if your game is a puzzle and only  of the playerbase understands that its a puzzle you have failed at effectively communicating what your game is.

If you are hoping for a grand conclusion to an epic story line you almost certainly wont find it although the lore revealed along the journey is really cool IMO. But if you can get down with enjoying the grind of exploring and upgrading and dogfighting and whatnot it really can be an incredibly addictive game.Oh and check out some hints amp  tips guides.

One of the best things about NMS is how easy it is to get lost. Even just when you spot something in your ship and then land and want to find it  it can be jarring. Having a sort of cartography mechanic in the game would fit really well with the explorationplaystyle maybe you could even leave it behind for another player.

On a note as to the the whole narrative being about the game universe being a simulation I get that from the perspective of a Korvax seeing as they are Robots who swap out consciousness at will thus can inhabit any Korvax body in existence...Also the Gek were once a war like nation conquering the Galaxy and even defeated the Korvax but were losing to the Sentinels before their whole society fragmented as some followed the way of the Atlas and began to revere it like the Korvax do...They Vykeen are the exception here as they just fight everyone and are the oldest race...I think the Travellers are in fact all one person...You...and in fact a time traveller the reason why Atlas wants your catalogued experience is because it does not understand or have control over time and perhaps that is its goal to unlock time travel.

Like you i would be interested to know the true nature of this new HG group.Dont agree with your last comment.  If in fact they are employing a PR firm Lets just assume yes for a second then surely they are doing the legwork research and community testing instead of the core HG team.Putting this in context to real life i work in Mobile Communication Software for a major player and the crap i have to put up with on the delivery side because of things that are over sold or features that weve sold that have never even been discussed at an Engineering level until customers pull out a  page RFI and refer to an FC response  days before signoff. This oversell underdeliver philosophy has existed in every SW company ive worked for and sadly im being forced to conclude thats its the norm rather than the exception.  Not trying to normalize the complaints or even defend HG but its rife and im surprised we dont see or notice more of it.

8838491,0,t1_d7a8gl9,Go to the things with the orange lights poking out. Look for transmission. Sometimes youll get a marker labelled as a Transmission Tower.The orange things will never take you directly to the ships. Only to transmission towers sometimes.Go to the transmission tower its a regular building with a panel that you can interact with inside. When looking at the panel it says transmission tower in the tooltip as well.Interact with it and solve the puzzle. This then shows you the crashed ship. The icon is like a bulls eye symbol.Not sure where you could be getting lost in that. If youve never had to do the pattern puzzles then its likely youve never gone to a transmission tower but are rather expecting the orange beacony things to take you directly to a ship.The orange beacons dont always show transmission towers but transmission towers will only ever show crashed ships. So the only place I think you could get confused is with finding the transmission tower.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d7a9fdi,8,t5_325lr

It would fly in the face of the very clear directives Sony laid out in the leaked and verified documents that started popping up months ago.   This was just an incredibly poorly optimized game from the beginning and seeing how even incredibly highend PC owners are getting the exact same experience as PS owners just with stable framerates and literally zero enhancements outside of some mods it doesnt make any sense that HG was somehow better prepared for the PS Pro.  ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d7dmk12,1,t5_325lr

Life isnt fair no one owes you anything not even truth and allowing yourself to be parted from your money over a product that hasnt emerged to be sold yet is borderline retarded. Commerce has flowed along for thousands of years using those that cant accept these things as a backbone and still most refuse to learn. Those of us you see as apologists or exercising mental gymnastics arent in your boat...were happy with the game we received. Whether we pre ordered it or waited to see what it would actually be a dayweek later we got what we wanted. We didnt swallow  the pitches and promises presented by a forprofit company we didnt see anything more in the marketing videos than a basic concept and most of us took our time to allow reviews instead of previews to filter out to get a grip on the reality of the situation. If youre angry at how this all went down or that you lost your money in this deal let it teach you a lesson you use going forward buying literally anything before you can hold it in your hands or experience it personally isnt a good idea....or you know...just keep repeating the exact same mistakes millions of others have over thousands of years...that seems to be working for some of you.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d7qg9ld,-1,t5_325lr

8999869,0,t1_d7tmnet,Google is an American multinational technology company specializing in Internetrelated services and products that include online advertising technologies search cloud computing and software. Most of its profits are derived from AdWords an online advertising service that places advertising near the list of search results.Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University California. Together they own about  percent of its shares and control  percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September  . An initial public offering IPO took place on August   and Google moved to its new headquarters in Mountain View California nicknamed the Googleplex.In August  Google announced plans to reorganize its interests as a holding company called Alphabet Inc. When this restructuring took place on October   Google became Alphabets leading subsidiary as well as the parent for Googles Internet interests.Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products acquisitions and partnerships beyond Googles core search engine Google Search. It offers online productivity software Google Docs including email Gmail a cloud storage service Google Drive and a social networking service Google. Desktop products include applications for web browsing Google Chrome organizing and editing photos Google Photos and instant messaging and video chat Hangouts. The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system and the browseronly Chrome OS for a class of netbooks known as Chromebooks and desktop PCs known as Chromeboxes. Google has moved increasingly into communications hardware partnering with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its highquality lowcost Nexus devices. In  a fiberoptic infrastructure was installed in Kansas City to facilitate a Google Fiber broadband service.Google has been estimated to run more than one million servers in data centers around the world as of . It processes over one billion search requests and about  petabytes of usergenerated data each day as of . In December  Alexa listed Google.com as the most visited website in the world. Numerous Google sites in other languages figure in the top one hundred as do several other Googleowned sites such as YouTube and Blogger.Googles mission statement from the outset was to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful and its unofficial slogan was Dont be evil. In October  the motto was replaced in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase Do the right thing. Googles commitment to such robust idealism has been increasingly been called into doubt due to a number of actions and behaviours which appear to contradict this.This article is about the company.

9025461,0,t1_d7whhhr,The issue is the lack of communication. To say that the game would release with missing features which by now it seems wont ever see the light of day would have financially been shooting themselves in the leg but it would have at least helped reduce some of the hate.But really at this point the most inexcusable thing is that theyre not saying anything. I may be too optimistic here but I strongly believe that if they came out and said that they overpromied and ran out of money before they could make good on those promises people would be less angry.I like you am happy that they released the game in its current form rather than avoided making it at all. I am very unhappy that they deliberately avoided making it clear that some features that were mentioned repeatedly and sometimes explicitly one might add did not make it to the finished product. And I am even less happy that theyre currently keeping quiet.As many people on this subreddit have already mentioned its fine to reach for the skies and think you could turn your game into the cure for cancer. It is quite another matter however to tell people that that will be the case and not to tell them things went down south before they cancel their chimo appointments. ...That analogy may have been a touch too dark but I think it gets the point across. Without these features I dont think its a  game and its unfair that they didnt make sure people were aware of exactly what theyd be getting. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d7wpvwy,1,t5_325lr

9054527,0,t1_d80711s,Its an excellent example of a good Early Access game with already a lot of content to game with. Its a bit like the developers older games Galaxy on Fire which are sort of arcadey space combat games.ES in particular gives you a ship with the ability to loot and craft preset modules and weapons and engage in randomized levels. The goal kind of like NMS is to get as far as possible jumping between sectors small playing areas filled with good stuff like combat encounters asteroids to fly inside of and mine stuff from explore derelict graveyards raid pirate bases trader ships freighter escorts to ambush etc.It also bills itself as a roguelike  you cant get back to prior levels death resets you to the beginning you have permanent perks to purchase though so your playthrough deaths can accumulate to something gainful longterm and sectors may range anywhere from mundane to extremely almost unfairly hazardous  filled with mines has solar flares has black holes contains a giant ship that can melt your ship into slag in one long shot etc.I bought if for USD and at that price local regional laws yay! its a crazy bargain.

9099332,0,t3_54wi0m,This witch hunt that certain media outlets and many internet commenters are conducting is damaging the game industry. Hello Games and Sean Murry are being held to a standard that has never been imposed on game developers before.Trailers for games and even very early gameplay videos especially  year old ones do not and never will represent the game that is released. Things change during development testing and play testing. No developer holds briefings revealing all their design changes just as no recording artist holds a press conference to tell their fans all the little changes that happened in the production of their new CD.  Now would anyone go after an artist over something like that? No they would simply decide that they didnt like the music and move on.Are we going to hold movie producers to this level of scrutiny?  If so movie makers better get ready for a crap ton of nuisance legal action.Seriously this is ridiculous. I think everyone gets that a lot of people dont like the game they bought and some who were perhaps overly invested in features that they imagined would be there are annoyed. Good grief people let it go. Its nothing more than harassment and a witch hunt now.Whats worse is media outlets like Forbes IBT and Eurogamer who all fed the living hell out of the hype machine for years are now among those leading the charge to castigate HG and Sean Murray. But then I think we all know that the gaming media that feeds the hype also feeds off the hype. Its pretty damn dishonest for media outlets to hype the crap out of something for a long time and then turn around and blast a developer over that same hype. Its a witch hunt nothing more nothing less. People are piling on Sean Murray and Hello Games in a very ugly manner. The problem here is that not only is this disproportionate to the actual events but its also damaging to the game industry. Smaller developers watching this will think twice about trying to innovate and make something new. Its far safer to make more of the same old crap that  it is to take risks and make something new. The risks are about reputation and money. After the No Mans Sky debacle I cant imagine many smaller teams and some larger teams would want to stick their head in this noose. So they wont theyll scale back theyll play it safe and games will be mediocre and boring. Larger developers are watching this too their investors are watching it unfold and their decisions govern what games get made and what ambitions those games have. Those investors are going to play it safe and anything that carries any risk will be shot down in flames for a good long while now.Is NMS missing some features that people anticipated? Yes. Were concrete definitive promises made concerning those features in a lot of cases the answer is no but people extrapolated what they saw on early publicity videos and assumed that certain features would be present.  HG did not recognize that this was a huge problem until it was too late and Sean Murray as enthusiastic as he is could have used a PR person to help him maintain a better control of the narrative about the game.  Something else that Sean Murray could and should have done is to avoid commenting on game elements he was not working on. Sean did the landscapes and environments hes not a net coder or a user interface guy. When asked questions about those things he needed to stick to a very safe line or simply say thats not his area of expertise with the game.What Sean Murray is not is a malicious liar trying to con anyone out of anything thats a very disingenuous view to take of him. My take is that he is a very enthusiastic guy who dreams big and has difficulty separating talking about that vision and actuality  especially when the actuality is still under construction and so the vision is still a possibility.But yeah the witch hunt continues. It needs to end but too many people are emotionally invested in their anger for that to happen.

There are still there in a really simple way but having in it would have added some to it but I dont know if a lot of depth because the way it is it would have had to tie in to the story in a meaningful way to be anything other than a race being hostile and having a number to prove that. Though yeah that would add a lot more.And theres is not really plenty more to add that is not only for cosmetic purpose IMO. All that orbit skybox traveling across galaxies realtime is just as big bs as it not being there after being promised.

And it contradicts your statement that you got downvoted because people are jerks. It may be hard for you to understand but people dont usually downvote a good post simply because theyre jerks. They downvote shitposts because theyre shitposts and feel good about it because theyre jerks. Now that you know maybe you undestand why your I think Sean is dead post got downvoted to hell and beyond.Your admittance for being stupid was for the wrong reason though which you worded carefully to make you appear goodwilled instead of stupid. So quit your bullshit with me I know how this stuff works. The correct wording would be I am stupid because I create pompous titles for stupid posts that noone cares about and think that people wont be jerks to me while Im a jerk to them.Also thank you for your question it would be an honor to reply to such interest about my well being. Indeed reading and replying to your posts had burned most of my brain cells but those pharmaceuticals did wonders to restore me back to normal. I would gladly recommend them to you but they wouldnt work in your case since when god was raining brains you were holding an umbrella. Any other questions youd want me to reply to? That said I am glad that I am no longer suspected of being a troll.And once again what does voting for serious issues have to do with using a pompous title for a shitpost? You said that your mistake was using such a title yourself. What kind of logic is this and why am I surprised to witness this logic by the I think that Sean is dead guy.

Because I did some experiments before I made my first run I know it is less efficient. However all of your star systems will be yellow if you only travel to and through black holes.

I wouldnt necessary trust the rotation claims stuff to be true. I know it seems so specific and so detailed that you ask yourself WHY. Why would he make that up. But that might be the case.Take for example the loading screen for the game. He said even during the livestream the day of launch that discoveries made by other players would show up here. Its bullshit. The game loads the names from a json text file. Static name list. Why claim that? You know the PC crowd is going to tear down every detail.I mean maybe the feature was intended and never happened. Maybe he thought his team implemented it and they didnt get around to it. Maybe it was just exaggeration on things he wished to be true. I dont know one way or another but it helps shed light and question many of the claims that were made in the past about things like no skybox chemical makeup of atmosphere etc. I believe he honestly thought the end product would live up to those standards but they couldnt pull it off.As I said Im a fan of the game and have put more time into it than any other in years. But Ive lost my rose colored glasses for how things went down. I dont have a lot of faith in any claims made about features unless the actually exist today.

Then you claim its shit compared to D. Let me tell you its not. What you most likely associate with D these days is the fact that youve been growing up playing it just like me when the modern Internet was still very fresh and new for everybody.Looking back Diablo wasnt a great game. It wasnt competitive at all  only for the first  weeks after a ladder reset which didnt happen very often. The endgame was an incredibly boring and unchallenging grind that didnt require any skill whatsoever. Youd literally just sit through the  waves and kill Baal with literally zero risks and repeat the whole process every  minutes. The graphics were extremely bad too even back then in . Originally  resolution? cmon. The release of LoD didnt help very much here.I dont intend to just bash Diablo I loved it back in those days and played it a lot. The runes and runewords were great. While the PVP games duel duels duelz etc were extremely fun you can hardly call those competitive it was literally just ffa.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d8a1ecm,2,t5_325lr

Popular opinion doesnt make it right unpopular opinion doesnt make it wrong.  gtYou are everywhere. I am god?gt You seem obsessed with haters. Is everything alright?Well you see I have been in this sub for  years.  It started out a core of solid people having a good time sharing ideas and was positive.  Then about  months before release the rgaming crowd showed up and things changed.Far fetched ideas starting popping up and it was based on nothing.  We had stickiesFAQs telling people this game is not multiplayer yet every other fucking post in this sub started to be asking about multiplayer to the point that the automod started automatically deleting them because it was answered months ago and yet kept coming.Fast forward to release.  I have had more people bitching and moaning and bashing the game and when it boils down to what was promised which is a retarded thing to say since nothing was promised outside of  quintillion planets to explore it seems they haterstrolls we always bring  up multiplayer. Its almost as if they are too stupid to be on the internet or literally trolling.  Either way it passes the time.gtIs everything alright? You put a fair bit of effort into your posts and I am really curious what is actually going on in your life to cause you to go on this one man crusade.You see this sub has lost lots of good people that care about and enjoy NMS just fine.  We used to be a fun group with comics art ideas and having a good time.After the rgaming crowd showed up the game was delayed.  The tone of the sub went negative for the first time.  People that were supposed fans of NMS and Sean threatened to kill him for the delay and the endless barrage of shittalk about Sean and HG began.Lots of us did not many did.  Many of us even suggested to Sean that would play his game no matter what even if he released it unfinished.  We all wanted it bad some of us more than others.As for my crusade I understand what Sean is trying to do.  I understand his vision and goals and more importantly I understand how much this game means to him.We are the fanscustomers.  There are always going to be unsatisfied customers.  While I understand some of the complaints are valid others are not.  But you want to know why I reply? Because I want Sean to continue working on his game.  I want him to come to work and not have to see nothing but the shit postsnegative memes FROM US.We do not need a countdown timer of players playing at am every day.  This is just trying to be mean to either the fans or HGSean.  I think that we have  groups of people in this sub.  First group fans that are having fun second people that want the game to be better but still bash the game and third poeple that just want to cause strifetrollantagonize the other  groups.Most of my comments are to figure out which group the people replying to me are in as groups  and  speak in similar ways.More importantly it is for Sean and HG to know that even in the sea of angry upset trolls haters negative shit there are some of us that are not angry that are not upset and love their work and are hopeful for the future.That is why I do not care about the downvotes.  Some of the most downvoted comments in this sub are kind words of support.  That is what the community should be doing.  If you dont want to give support and do not want the game to be better then bounce.Why are people hanging around talking shit?  You worry about what is going on my life to do this? What about the thousands that quitdont carearent playing that spend days on end shitposting?Do you ask them why they continue?

9191076,0,t1_d8h0yvn,I mean the change between D and D fundamentally changes genres that even have the same featuresets for instance Castlevania moving from D to D fundamentally changed the game to an arguably poorer state due to the nature of platforming navigation etc. in a D environment. I do think trying out something like Empyrion would be a better move honestly realistically people should probably wait for Star Citizen at this point  though it may not provide the kind of colour and simplicity of No Mans Sky itll provide deeper systems with a richer featureset in a similar setup. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d8h1beb,2,t5_325lr

There are no easter eggs there are no lore rewards there are no unlockable mysteries there are no secrets for flying beyond suns or galaxy boundaries.

Charging full price for what you claim is a final product versus charging a partial price for early access to a project in development is a monumental difference.  If NMS wanted to add in promised features after release they should have explained it was EA and incomplete before release I for one would have waited on purchasing it because Im not paying full AAA price to be a beta tester.As for generation ships and space dredgers these were lore ideas that were never fleshed out.  The game was a complete experience without it.  Thats a far cry from NMS being a skeletal version of what the game was explained to be right up until release no multiplayer no eco systems no intelligent AI no dynamic flying or factions systems or unique ships or centre of the universe etc etc etc.So yeah.

9212933,0,t1_d8jsb99,Cool. I get that. I would say that your response though focuses too much on traditional content and not enough on more sublime aspects like topography.I agree that the assets mushrooms stalactites etc. And biomes Tundra Toxic Meadow... Are repetative. I dont see that as a problem because I never expected NMS or any procgen game to provide that type of variety. If anything the scope of procgen forces designers to give it more strict parameters than they would for a hand crafted world.For example if I write a best man speech I can give it a level of detail personality and structure that would be risky to enshrine in a set of instructions for others to write the same speech I feel like I wrote that badly. Does it make sense?.That has no bearing of course on wether NMS is good or worth  except that it can calibrate expectations. I always thought the algorithm would generate variations on a select few artistic tropes and thats what I think it does. I never expected any more variety than a standard sci fi tale barren planet forest planet snow planet etc..Where it does show surprising variety is topography! Its much more varied than people give it credit for. If I get time Ill post about it its a bit in depth for half midnight.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d8jt2zk,-8,t5_325lr

Which was then repackaged as Burnout Paradise Ultimate. I get it he lied hes a liar but fuck me if people arent hopping into that victim role and feeling justified in saying whatever unrehearsed bullshit that has too little in relation to NMS.Its not a glimps into the future at all.

Even up to release no expectations were grounded by the development team. I swear within any other gaming community things would have been straightened out by the development team as launch neared. I have seen other devs do it before. So much potential wasted on an incompetent team unwilling to be honest with their fans. I am not surprised we havent heard a peep from Sean.

Like troll your friends hes probably thinking naming a planet Steve likes nuts but we all think you can throw a friend down a pit and kill him.Again vague answers that are true in a very vague sense but how most people perceived them as a normal and no clarifications or real detail on game mechanics.

9317804,0,t1_d8wzbmn,This is exactly the main problem I have with No Mans Sky and its not even a limitation of procedural generation as a technique. Most of what No Mans Sky has shouldnt even be called procedural generation at best a lot of it is just procedural variation. They handbuilt assets and then we get to see endless subtle variations on the same archetypes but for all intents and purposes they are the same thing.Remember that No Mans Sky was initially pitched to us with the phrase Every atom  leaf  bird  ship  cloud  whatever procedural in the first reveal trailer. Part of the hype for some of us was that we imagined they could be truly generating the assets procedurally which actually isnt impossible. You can generate geometry and textures for complex things like grass trees leaves rocks and various plants on the fly using wellunderstood maths and you can add mutator variables to produce wildly different and unexpected results.When it comes to complex creatures its a lot more difficult because they have to be animated and even just attaching procedural geometry to a skeleton would be a huge technical challenge. The post on this subreddit looking at the creature generator actually just exposed how limited the generator was. There are only a few base creatures each one with a variety of different headsbodies etc and the game literally just switches all but one off. There are some additional things like horns colour differences but it was never going to produce complex or unexpected results because all creatures of the same type share the same animations and behaviour. Its a very clever system but still very limited all the assets are handproduced rather than procedural and they had to know theyd need more archetypes and behaviours to cover that up.The planet terrain was actually pretty good. You can generate way more realistic planets with continents using fractal noise and erosion models but for a small team developing something to run in realtime their approach was good enough to produce reasonable variation. They made planets use noise for terrain height and then added premade terrain features and subtracted premade cave features. But again they had to know that these features would begin to obviously repeat after a while and they should have built more of them to keep things interesting. Once youve seen one green planet with floating islands youve seen them all.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d8x3lri,22,t5_325lr

But also like NMS there were loads of features promised in development that were absolutely abandoned. Before launch there was a online Curiosity Cube that required an unknown number of taps to open and the last person to tap it would become the first God of Godus or something like that and recieve a share of the profits and all sorts of in game significance.Immediately following the announcement of the winner all this was abandoned.It was also primarily marketed as a PC game during development but all PC players got was a crappy port of a mobile game that requires so much clicking that it will give you carpal tunnel syndrome.Total Biscuit followed the development and gives a more entertaining run down of everything that changed between what people were sold and what people received than I can write heree To further drive home the similarities to NMS Godus was supposed to take place on a giant procedurally generated map the size of Jupiter which would be shared by all players.e and the developers went radio silent and stopped updating it.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d90f7ts,5,t5_325lr

However it is still up to the consumer to be a smart consumer. What do I mean by that? Wait for reviews. There really is no earthly reason as to why you cant just wait a week and look at what the critics say.Also its never a good sign if a developer doesnt give copies to reviewers before release date. That almost always spells trouble. This was the case with NMS. No review copies were given prior to release date.

9384129,0,t1_d9292ir,Yep forests are excellent to heal human sapiens mind. They grew us up as a species after all. No beauty  for us humans  was mainly not in the midst of destruction and uncertainty. We are limited beings. We do not inhabit the universe  which at large is indeed violent and chaotic. We inhabit Gaia using the term per James Lovelocks definition of course. Gaia being more than sum of all the parts of Earths biosphere has several distinct features and one of them is exceptional ability to moderate and mitigate destruction and uncertainty within itself. It is badly damaged at present but for vast majority of human time on Earth it wasnt that much. As a result humans evolved in an environment which was pretty much structured as opposed to chaotic and nonviolent.The latter was true for humans who were well adapted to their environments of course  im talking prehistoric huntergatherer humans who existed on Earth for hundreds thousands years. Almost all the time those people were living in the same habitat knowing extremely well how not to become food for any big carnivore species present at their location. We can still see much of that lifestyle today by looking at certain tribes in Amazon basin and to a lesser degree by looking at small and shrinking bonobo and orangutan populations in the wild. Those people and those apes spend their lives in quite nonchaotic way and only very rarely have to deal with actual lifethreatening violence towards themselves  perhaps something like . of their lives are spent taking or expecting to take actual harm. But now times change. Gaias functions get disabled or massively damaged and the face of inanimate universe violent and chaotic as it ever is stares at us more and more. It is for a reason they call nature Mother Nature and nowadays shes dying. Whether humans will be able to go on in any civilized form without her protection  is not a tribial question. Personally i think the answer is no. My only general hope is for some relatively small land regions of the world maintaining fullcycle ecosystems plus oceans phytoplankton surviving through as well otherwise were quite done in terms of oxygen deprivation longterm. In other words i hope Gaias most resilient features can endure every damaging effect from modern global human enterprise and still endure past its collapse without losing much of their function. I dont think any forest would survive though  between knowing how much mankind cuts knowing the story of Easter island realizing foreseeable effects of incoming global thermal maximum in terms of forest fires and emerging superbugs who destroy wood on gargantuan scale in warmer climate i dont think forests will last any much than  more years... Globally any of them. So enjoy while it lasts i guess...,NoMansSkyTheGame,d95i5v9,1,t5_325lr

As in even if it were absolutely true too many people wouldnt believe it at this point.Sean Murrays career is most likely dead at this point. IIRC he quit EA because he wanted to pursue his own vision depending on just how hard of a break that was he may be able to go back to whatever he did there or he may be out of the industry for good after this.Hello Games as Hello Games is tarnished by this release however how many members of the team can you name aside from Sean?

To the average person the compression in audio is completely unnoticeable.  I actually thought the audio sounded better than the original game due to the improved mixing of voice sfx and music.  For those who do notice it Im sure mods will be available soon to replace it.  I happen to be middle aged and the average high frequency hearing range for middle aged people is around khz.  The PC version of Skyrim Special Edition has the audio compressed so over over khz is clipped.

9464253,0,t1_d9fmbih, Make No Mans Sky Great Again The monotony of it is spot on.  I enjoyed it for about  hours and I was sucked in for those  hours.  Games like this had hopes of about  hours.  I am still not even done with Fallout  and I have over  hours and it is still a year later.  I think the progression of the game hurt it too.  You are pretty much setup with everything after about an hour and the really good content was rare.  It is probably the most realistic exploration game ever made.  What I would do is make an evolutionary algorithm that basically generates the first galaxy.  Then takes the  of the planets that are the most interesting or randomly generated space battles etc.  Replace the bottom  with randomized content based on the  that were great but keep the first  best.  ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d9fnspf,-1,t5_325lr

Sometimes having life on planets or planets that could sustain life being rare is the better way to go about it exploration wise. It makes finding life so much more meaningful. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,d9sf078,2,t5_325lr

9615377,0,t1_d9y8cyr,its nothing like Eve but the complexity will grow every year as they focus on a new aspect of gameplay like next I think they are doing multi crewed ships eventually they will do atmospheric landings they also want a first person element and boarding fighting inside ships. how much of that will make it into the game is anyones guess but its things they want to do. elite has a  year plan and is on year  nearly .Eve is the better multi player game by far though even if you wanted to just trade you would get a more realistic and meaningful experience out of it there than in elite.the best way I can sum it up is that everything nms does poorly the combat and the trading the galaxy map those things are a lot better in elite but elite doesnt currently have the same level of exploration its equally flat at the moment.,NoMansSkyTheGame,d9yak4x,3,t5_325lr

9679401,0,t3_5dn7vq,Yes I do. I had depression and anxiety too. Started meditating about  years ago and my gaming habits changed significantly. Games I used to like no longer appeal to me because they caused me anxiety and frustration. I actually gave up gaming until Flower came out. I loved how chill it was and then I played Journey and found a new love for gaming. I look for those kinds of experiences in games and I feel like NMS does appeal to that. Even though I can tap into my chill vibes and relax in NMS I find myself after  hours wanting more. I really do hope theres an update in the works.Edit I recorded some Peaceful Moments that I put together into montages. Sometimes I put one on if I dont have time to actually play and get lost in the audio. At least that has been done quite well so kudos to Paul Weir.

That guy was the one who created this shitstorm. If he would advertise game as it was and told more that these are things they want to add to the game with updates we could really avoid whole this thing.Still they need someone for community. They need to talk to us and tell what is going on.

I view the game as essentially space Minecraft and cant wait to check out this update.My only concern is they need to add something new as a goal for players not playing creative or survival. In Minecraft you have reasons to explore for special resources and locations that can help you towards different goals like reaching the Nether or the End.Right now we have the base stuff but once thats finished theres nothing to do,NoMansSkyTheGame,dajih00,4,t5_325lr

It does seem to honor the Windows sensitivity plus many gaming mice these days also have a sensitivity selector on the mouse itself or in the provided software. So what Ive been doing is setting my mouse to half its normal sensitivity while I play NMS and then switch back when Im done.

Thats your opinion and I truly believe youre in the minority. Most of the subreddit including myself would love having planets and moons orbit the sun and eachother even though they are really close together. Why? Because it makes the game more interesting it adds immersion and even better views than we already have.Just imagine starting survival on a planet that is tidally locked at night it would be hell. It can potentially add gameplay elements as well.If they do end up adding orbits they wont make the planets be farther away from eachother. Theyll keep them close to preserve the NMS aesthetic. Even if they did make the planets orbit realistically far away from eachother just take a look at how Elite Dangerous does that. Its all about speed and being able to stop in an instant. It doesnt get more complicated than that. Our ships do not orbit planets. Our ships are not affected by gravity. Cant you grasp this?

You clearly havent even seen the trailer or read the parent comment and you think its okay to attack and insult others.To be clear the backlash is not because of missing content. The backlash is entirely because of Sean Murrays repeatedly and intentionally misinformative halftruthful roundabout and ambiguous replies. Even after players found each other on stream he ignored the fact that they cant interact with each other yet went on to brag about the games online features and how great their network coders are.,NoMansSkyTheGame,dax538n,1,t5_325lr

How many games do you want sold to you or attempted to be sold to you that are incomplete but priced and sold as a completed game with the developers free to make whatever claims about it that they simply dont have to follow through with?Like I said if I was a shit person I wouldnt be typing this to you right now Id be in a free copy of UE learning how to use it in its most basic form to easily rip you guys off.And frankly I think the only reason HG wont come out apologize and detail exactly how theyre going to fix this is because theyre arent. They wont acknowledge it theyll continue to pretend what they said before release matches the game they delivered. And why wouldnt they?

What Im talking about is finding a ship but before you trade yours in for it fly back to your base leave your ship there and walk to the new ship and claim it.

9966391,0,t1_db624kp,Id love to see them pretty much scrap the existing upgrade system and retool the base to let me research the tech that I want to have in the order that I want to do it.They could break things down into tech trees combat stealth storage space speed and maneuverability etc. If they are worried about balance make each new tech tree you buy into more expensive. So if I want to make a fast ship with lots of storage space I could play as a smuggler and only invest in two trees relatively cheaply. But later if I want to put huge guns on that ship its going to cost me extra to research that tech. For a game that sells itself as exploring the universe however you want to right now you really have no control over what skills you develop first and once you do find new tech it really doesnt lend itself to many different play styles. It also does away with the ridiculous problem I have in my current survival game where I have found every single grenade upgrade multiple times but I still dont have the basic grenade tech so its all useless to me. An upgrade system like this would be totally in line with the spirit of the game reinforce bases as a vital game mechanic and most importantly it give the player a sense of control over the game. So far almost every important event comes down to luck and random chance and this system would in at least one respect actually let the player make an informed decision about what would be fun for them. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,db6napv,2,t5_325lr

Its an extreme Toxic planet while simultaneously being an extreme sentinel planet. The planet is almost constantly in a storm state but it is packed with some serious goodies. I thought I was at the point where I got a handle on the tricks to making it in survival mode and had lots of quality gear. But let me tell you that little moon fucked my shit right up. Its the first time I have ever gotten a wanted level above three. It happened because I got caught in a storm after garbing some gravitino balls. So dug into the ground to get out of the storm but couldnt get deep enough to lose the sentinals intrest ran out of materials to reload Tried to make a break for it when the storm cleared and they slaughtered me the second I poked my head up.

There is a sload of money involved and  bucks is much money for people who have to work for it.The game failed. ok. We payed the money. ok. Everybody was discussing about the game on this sub and no its not just hate its people who are dissapointed on HG for not communicating and delivering a bad shallow game. ok.But what drives me crazy is the fact that the foundation update released and everybody gets in a hail jesus hello games we love you state again completely forgetting about what happend.Dont get me wrong the update is okay but its just crafting like in any other crafting game on the shy early acsess market. The update is missing the philosophy of the game and nobody matters. Now people are srsly write threads and tell people to go on steam and make all reviews positiv again because the game is now and will be perfect.sry but wtf?Not just the game is still overpriced no they lure people who dont know much about the game into throwing  bucks out of the window. Thats not ok.everything negative gets downvotet to hell again and all the pretty screenshots dominate the sub.thats almost cencorship.Developers have to stop with this . And we as the customers we have to fight for quality products. Gaming is my hobby since almost  years i play video games and buy everything original to support the devs where i can. And I wanna play video games for the next  Years too. Its a big part of many of our lives and we should get quality games because we pay soooo much money for it.Release a full game for  bucks a indi game for  or a early acsess for gt.

So what you want is the guaranteed way  you aint gonna like it.Polo. That sucker in the anomalies. The tech he gives off follows a sequence and all three warp drives appear there. But that means playing through the game and warping through many systems and fulfilling all the many many milestone achievements required.A list of polos rewards and the order in which they come is available hereAlternatively you can just wait until you find a ship with those warp drives and buy it but that means passing over loads of cool ships with better looks and higher capacities that dont have it.,NoMansSkyTheGame,dbo8zqx,2,t5_325lr

But of course you get less than one lubricant per plant.   So how many pearl plants do you need to equal the cash rate of mordite? Surely some EXPERT has actually done the math on units per hour per plant to back up their assertion mordite is for amateurs. You get three pearls per hour from a plant so thats  units per hour per plant. Now someone tell us all how much lubricant you can produce per hour from one mordite plant disregarding the crafting time. I have  plants and heaps of time to craft I guess you would need about  plants more more to grow fast enough to continuously harvest to where you arent waiting around for the next crop and crafting time becomes a problem.,NoMansSkyTheGame,dboftm2,2,t5_325lr

10245457,0,t1_dc59vgh,Except it isnt about the journey. The act of traveling is tedious and boring and underdeveloped and unrefined. The direction the most recent update went proves that they dont want people exploring they want them taking screenshots.As for most infinite game ever technically there are far more permutations for a  card deck of playing cards than planets in this game. Literally look it up. On top of that it takes  minecraft worlds to have more square feet of terrain then every planet in NMS. And minecraft has billions of possible worlds.As for its name that is even more stupid. Literally everything is named settled and built to a galactic standard so the name might as well be Many Gek Korvax and Vykeens Sky.As for making a difference it is less of that and more of realizing your insignificance. Nothing you do affects anything on a galactic scale. Nothing affects other peoples worlds other than your names. You cant even see other players.

10264686,0,t3_5mudk2,For me it goes beyond what is on the surface of this awesome piece of software. But I love everything about it. I have been playing it since release day and have not stopped since. Reason for that is after discovering Star Wars back when I was  in  I always wanted to go out into space and just fly around visiting different planets and walk about their surfaces.. just seeing what was there.. Especially after seeing the forest moon Endor in Return of the Jedi...it looked amazing to me at that age still does today..Years later for my PlayStation now age  I got a little game called Colony Wars Vengeance .. and that game changed everything for me... Hell during the very first mission Escort Duty I flew for well over half an hour at the earth below thinking i could get closer... but of course that would never happen as it was just a background texture. But boy that game fed the flames even more....Fast forward to the release of No Mans Sky now age  and after several hours playing finally taking off of my starter planet... and my goodness did I have a moment. I had never played a game like this one even though I know now there are others like it but turning my ship around to see where I just lifted off from then exiting the atmosphere and seeing a distant other planet behind asteroids.. and spinning around to see my planet.. I completely was lost in it. I then went on to play for about  hours and had to stop only because I had to go to work hahah. But for me that is what I love about this game. The visuals the experience at least for me and just the exploration aspect of it all. Yes I know it has some flaws but for me.. I just love it for what it is. Ill get flamed for this for sure. but I just wanted to share a little of why I keep playing it and have kept playing it since it came out.I could go on and on about this game and why it hit the spot for me.. but Ill end it here ,NoMansSkyTheGame,dc7k3m7,2,t5_325lr

10271501,0,t3_5n2y0l,It is necessary to continue. The rewards come in order. Im working toward getting ten planets scanned and I agree. Its my least favorite thing to do. Some worlds are easier so dont be afraid to leave and come back if you need to. Here are my tricks... I like to drop a signal scanner and scan for outposts. They are usually a fifteen min walk or less. Then I walk it. The outposts almost always have a thing for calling my ship so I can keep it close. I just repeat that process so at least Im getting something done other than walking.  check all types of locations during the day and at night check caves check valleys and mountain tops. I have found different animals at different elevations.  check underwater. Actually I like to find planets without much water so I dont have to bother with that.  I also like to find planets with  or fewer creatures. Just makes things easier most of the time. But really just keep going and youll find them. ,NoMansSkyTheGame,dc8bx7z,1,t5_325lr

10382867,0,t1_dckqrls,While I agree mostly with the idea of rotation I kind of disagree with regards to orbits without some significant change in travel methods.  Because while it can take two minutes to get to planets that are very far apart from each other and they are relatively close to each other on the same side of the sun if the orbits differ enough and time passes enough youll end up with travel times approaching    minutes.  Warps are meant for truly interstellar travel so those would be inappropriate ...Portals could be activated that allow for orbital mechanics to not adversely impact travel time ...But all in all I think honestly this stuff was taken out because it does require some resources to do all that math when youre looking at a system that has something like four planets and two moons.  Having to figure out where a spot on a planet is and whats in the sky might actually cause performance issues particularly on older PCs or maybe the PS.So would it be neat?  Of course.

I worked up  million and found a  slot ship for  million. So I used that ship to just find transmission towers and try to find my final  slot ship.

10956395,0,t1_de9tphi,Oh No Mans Sky is certainly not the first  procedural generation has been around for a while.  And Ive got a column installment coming up in about  weeks I think where I point out that the engine for Elite Dangerous is sophisticated enough to successfully predict exoplanets which is amazingly cool.  Right now theres a free program called Space Engine which procedurally generates planets in the Milky Way although its basically a screenshot generator.But No Mans Sky IS staggering in the size and scope of what it pulls off even if the content is more wide than deep.  It is a galaxy in a bottle generated from scratch that is the size of a full galaxy.  And theyve done it in such a way that from walking around the ground to flying in deep space it really feels seamless.So credit where its due.,NoMansSkyTheGame,dea2ohh,3,t5_325lr

No Mans Sky despite how much you or I may enjoy it to some extent is a joke a meme in and of itself.  This means that their next project will be a tough sell to both producers and consumers.  If they can recoup their losses by fixing some of the glaring issues with the game it could reinstill faith in the company and lead to continued success.

11131913,0,t1_detjlpd,I disagree right off the bat once he started talking about the differences in ships....   this is the way I see it.    Before there werent any different classes in ships.  Ships were basically jack of all trades you were able to upgrade to massive storage ships while still upgrading it with the tech to turn it into a bad ass fighter while doubling as a trader.  Now they added the promised class system for ships and so you can keep the massive one you had cause lets face it... taking it away from you would be a dick move.. But from now on if you want a ship with massive storage space you need that specific class of ship...  Want a fighter with strong weapons?  Youll have to buy one of that class but since its a fighter and not a trader youll have sacrifice the cargo space as was intended with the class system.  As for how good each individual ship is at its intended role its the luck of the draw.Also also the patch notes mentioned that you go to buy a ship you can now get a discount based on how much your ship is worth compared to the one youre buying... if I understood that correctly in the case shown in the video your ship is  times the worth of the one youre looking to buy so you get it free...  they should be paying you for your ship.. but for some reason hello games overlooked that..So while i agree about missing features and graphical bugs being a bit of a pain in the ass  read and understand the patch before you make a video complaning about everything.,NoMansSkyTheGame,detsj2o,0,t5_325lr

You dont need to do anything you dont want to make money. There are activities you can do with a group if you have a single creative bone in your body. Trade hunt bounties join a playerrun organization.  For people who like sandbox games the freedom to get in a ship together and do missions is the fun part. There werent any group activities planned for NMS multiplayer the existence of which was a blatant lie to get people to buy. Frontier hasnt had to lie to the players to get them to buy the game.

You will be able to jump further than your old ship after you just upgrade it minimally. Use your  slot around the system to exploregather and when ready to move on land on your freighter change to class s and jump.

11220127,0,t1_df33q79,Yeah I lost almost a million credits in value by buying a beater getting a wreck fixing it up then finding out it was still only worth about half of what the comparison screen had told me when I took over the wreck. The whole feature just needs to be rolled back to how it was. Slot counts too. Let the difference be how much each slot can hold. I played for  hours today and I cannot understand how anyone thinks that less than  slots is feasible.Without  then you essentially could never explore planets and pick up everything that you find. The idea that you could switch ships for combat is ludicrous. You warp into a system thats at war you dont have the chance to switch to your fighter. You have to be ready to roll. Im afraid that this game is better with the differences between ship classes being relatively minor and each one being able to effectively multirole. I think that trying to make this into Elite is really a huge mistake. This is a casual game.But just like with Elite I think you have two segments of gamers who play this. Some want it to be really hard so we have Survival mode. But a lot of the tweaks to make Survival mode grittier are now bleeding over to Normal mode. Thats a mistake.Normal mode should stay the original No Mans Sky experience as close as possible and not be infected with the Survival mode peoples sadomasochistic grind obsession.,NoMansSkyTheGame,df3scur,1,t5_325lr
