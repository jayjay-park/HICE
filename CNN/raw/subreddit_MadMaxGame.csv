5059426,0,t1_cuvtkd9,Awesome! I wouldnt worry about the  gears its just a visual bug think one of mine doesnt even highlight any gears when I hover over it even though it is complete XDIn terms of the last relic are you making sure to head into each stronghold as they wont show up on the map if there is any scrap or relics located there. For the xbox controller youd click in the left stick when youre inside and it would show you if there is any scrap or relics left.If its not in the strongholds under Gastown or in Chums base then the only other place it could be is in the Dunes. I dont think there is any locations only with just a relic but I could be wrong. Below is a map with all locations in the Dunes. I guess you could go to each location and make sure it has appeared on your map if youre really stuck but hopefully youve just missed it in a stronghold.Best of luck finding it!,MadMaxGame,cuvuoe0,3,t5_35fc0

5083822,0,t3_3kn139,gtIn my opinion I was disappointed. I felt the opposite I thought the ending was just about how every Mad Max movie ends. Max gets a degree of revenge and winds up alone as always. gtChumbucket couldve use that explosive harpoon tipMaybe he ran out of them?gtor even repair it within that cutscene time when he was repairing if he had a level  repair upgradeA game mechanic like that never translates well to cutscenes. gtHaving him killed plus the car being destroyed was a little too dramatic and disappointing.Chum was just another person who betrayed Max he had it coming. Dieing along side his angel combustion was the only way that was gonna play out. ,MadMaxGame,cuysldz,6,t5_35fc0

5237128,0,t3_3mqgnn,Ill start with some common negatives that get mentioned and some positives at the bottom. Negatives I think some of the lukewarm reviews have to do with the similarity of hand to hand combat with Arkham Knight  Shadow of Mordor etc. If youve played those games to death you might be overfatigued with it.  Another common complaint is the repetitiveness of missions raid camp kill top dog loot repeat and again its apparent similarity to Shadow of Mordor and Far Cry ?.  Story is another complaint that gets mentioned often. In my case I dont expect too much into storyline really but I heard it gets better Im only halfway through the game. Positives  This is probably the best looking wasteland sandbox you will ever get to play. Its a game character in its own and its very easy to stop and admire the environment. A lot of detail went into this game. A best example of less is more . Avalanche I think is so confident of this that they rolled out a photocamera mode that lets you basically have a Photoshop tool ingame Car combat is awesome . Mad Max has always been about vehicles and this game doesnt fall short. It was very easy to criticize this bit but the only negative things youll hear about it is that there arent more of it or not as grandiose as the ones in Fury Road. Regardless car combat mechanics are top notch Car customization is fun . Theres a good amount of options that balance speed attack defense etc. You get a lot of car body options and colors too.  Theres a ton to do in this game . I guess this goes both ways if youre bogged down by too many todos then it might turn you off and dismiss it as repetitive. On the other hand if you get bored doing one thing you can always jump to another activity. There are death races ramps to show off from minefields to clear small camps to check random loot to be found on unmarked points in the map strongholds to fortify story missions wasteland missions car upgrading Max upgrading car convoy chasetakedown random car chasetakedown ways to kill warboys melee harpoon bear traps ram etc. Ill update this comment when I remember more stuff. Im only close to halfway the game and I already got my moneys worth in terms of fun. Its a game that I can play for about an hour and continue again the next day or you could play for hours on end. I have to admit though if I hadnt come across those negative reviews I probably wont be subconsciously thinking about the things they mentioned and enjoy the game more. As it is Im already tainted and so are you but that didnt diminish the fun for me. I know that its in our nature to get as much info before we commit time and money to a game but this is one of those instances where being blissfully ignorant will pay dividends in your Mad Max experience. ,MadMaxGame,cvh9ihu,10,t5_35fc0
5249346,0,t3_3mv9xo,Absolutely I do. The game works just like the movie sequels do. They take Max and put him through a whole grand ordeal only to leave him back in the same way as he was at the beginning though maybe a bit more psychologically worn ready to wander the wastes again and deal with what comes his way.,MadMaxGame,cviqh05,2,t5_35fc0

5596259,0,t3_3rrtmo,Absolutely.  I came into the game hearing the reviews saying the game was subpar disappointing mediocre whatever.However since Im taking the time to do every side mission I feel like Im able to take in and really digest the rich atmosphere the game has to offer.When the geography of the Great White convincingly portrays an old sea bed then you bust through the jaw and turn around only to realize you just went through a big ship dock and are now on the mainland complete with tarmac and remnants of a highway system.When you bust through a buried train then emerge into an underground subway system.  When you find a roof sticking up in the Dunes then climb down into a family home.  When you realize Gutgashs stronghold is a grounded cargo ship not because the game keeps telling you but because the set pieces are authentic.This game is extremely rewarding.,MadMaxGame,cwqrp4c,12,t5_35fc0

At the time I was desperate for scrap so I was trying to get them off my tail asap. After I had like  cars left I figured it wasnt worth more effort and I pulled near a rock. When I got out a car tboned my car when I was between the car and the rock. I glitched trough and got stuck there. As the weather calmed I was left there helplessly looking at  crates in the minimap.
