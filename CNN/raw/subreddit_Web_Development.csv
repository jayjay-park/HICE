4252244,0,t1_cs4fn7a,I already have access to the amount of views. What Im trying to do is not test the amount of views of each video but trying to quantify the amount of interaction each individual video causes by seeing how many people are clicking through to relevant pages that would be linked in an annotation as in this video  in order to test their effectiveness. Spoke to the lead developer who said they are planning to add this in the future but are busy atm and in the meantime it would be possible to find the link tracking software that allows you to be able to overlay elements over parts of the website in order to track the clicks on those elements.

Some things look simple and are while others appear simple and are infinitely complex. Somethings look hard and will leave you scratching your noggin unable and unwilling to sleepwhile others will delight you in their deceptive appearance of complexity. I love Web Development. I love tinkering and trying to build complex things. I have been caught in the ointment but I wouldnt have it any other way. You will get frustrated hate it and then figure out a tiny thing that makes it all work and be elated on the next level. You will be frustrated and overwhelmed but just like any elephant you can only eat it one bite at a time. ,Web_Development,cv4cavf,7,t5_2qrkm

If the client requires it we agree to put beta versions on their servers. When the web is finished at the beta location we request the final  and then deploy to production. This way if the client refuse to pay fortunately it is uncommon at least we get  we could sue by contract but that would be a waste of time and money in most cases in Spain.If you dont want to put your code in their server before getting paid explain to them that it would cost you more time and to them more money people will usually understand it.,Web_Development,d0dnegp,1,t5_2qrkm

9295428,0,t3_57ny5e,The common trend in frontend these days atleast where I live seems to be Angular. I hate that they are lumping databinding middleware layers into the frontend workflow however it is what it is. Basically what I am saying everything these days is JavaScript centric. So if you want to enter the frontend world you will want to learn Sass for CSS preprocessing familiarize yourself with Grunt or Gulp. I prefer gulp Even though I dont care for it nor do I use it Bootstrap is very popular with corporate infrastructures. To make it easier a good starter FE tech stack should look like this. HTMLCSS Responsive Design. JQuery JavaScript Vanilla. Gulp or Grunt Task Runner. Familiarity with Bootstrap Angular and VCS GitWith those skills alone depending on where you live a  entry level salary should easily be attainable. thats only k,Web_Development,d8u9g2c,1,t5_2qrkm

Id want to have a Holy Grail layout w header and footer kinda similar to Myth but Im not sure if theres anything better.

I would agree that the curriculum wasnt the best as far as teaching you new material but the good part is that its mainly projectbased. You can get through it if youre motivated to find answers from other resources online. Also having a mentor was very helpful...I had only been learning from online resources and entirely on my own up until that point so being able to talk to a seasoned pro kicked ass. You can squeeze a lot out of those mentoring sessions if you prepare for them too I made lists of questions before each one,Web_Development,dan3yau,1,t5_2qrkm

10180961,0,t3_5lrdex,Typically a blog platform uses a CMS of some sort. Wordpress drupal joomla you name it. Sounds utterly masochistic to do a blog platform completely static. Even a static site builder like jekyll is a step up. In fact that might be your best bet as its literally a static htmlcssjs site builder for blogs. The CMS portion is just local.Also look into using a git repo github bitbucket hostyourown for remote to check in your changes then SSH into your server to deploy clone down ln s your new public folder and deploy that way. This is far more efficient and much more secure than FTP and has a builtin rollback procedure ln s back to your old folder,Web_Development,dby2gun,2,t5_2qrkm
