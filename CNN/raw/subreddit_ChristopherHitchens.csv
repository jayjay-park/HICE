5103728,0,t3_3kubgu,Anyone trying to compare the neoconservatives to Kissinger doesnt understand what theyre talking about or how much bad blood there is between them and the so called realists. EDIT For anyone that wants the TLDR version this is the authors thesis and the facts are contorted to fit this rather infantile argument. At the very least we can learn from Kissingers long life that the two defining concepts of American foreign policyrealism and idealismarent opposing values instead they reinforce each other. Idealism gets us into whatever the quagmire of the moment is realism keeps us there while promising to get us out and then idealism returns anew both to justify the realism and to overcome it in the next round. So it goes.,ChristopherHitchens,cv16tuh,2,t5_2r9ah

6458026,0,t1_czn4rg1,I wouldnt really call him a socialist but he certainly avoided association with the right wing. He did make more and more friends there and he did take some positions which most socialists consider reactionary but he always insisted that he was something apart from them. For what its worth he still admired my leftist heroes like Rosa Luxemburg Trotsky Paine and Orwell and this shows in his writing as well as his politics.,ChristopherHitchens,cznaxdo,4,t5_2r9ah

10578973,0,t1_dd7393k,Youre right thank you very much!Now lets not dance around  not all monotheisms are exactly the same at the moment. Theyre all based on the same illusion theyre all plagiarisms of each other but theres one in particular that at the moment is proposing a serious menace to not just freedom of speech but freedom of expression but to quite a lot of other freedoms too. This is the religion that exhibits the horrible trio of selfhatred selfrighteousness and selfpity. Im talking about militant Islam. Globally its a gigantic power. Globally its a gigantic power. It controls an enormous amount of oil wealth several large countries and states with an enormous fortune. Its pumping the ideology of Wahhabism and Salafism around the world poisoning societies everywhere it goes ruining the minds of children stultifying the young in its madrassas training people in violence making a cult of death and suicide and murder. Thats what it does globally its quite strong. In our societies as a cringing minority whose faith he might offend which deserves all protection that the small and vulnerable group might need.Now it makes quite large claims for itself doesnt it? It says its the final revelation. It says that God spoke to one illiterate businessman in the Arabian peninsula three times through an archangel and that the resulting material as you can see when you read it is largely plagiarised from the old and the new testament. Almost all of it actually ineptly from the old and the new testament. It is to be accepted as a divine revelation and as the final and unalterable word and unalterable one and that those who dont accept this revelation are to be treated as cattle infidels slaves Victims Ill tell you what I dont think Muhammad ever heard those voices I dont believe it. The likelihood that Im right as opposed to the likelihood that a shepherd who couldnt read had bits of the old and new testament redictated to him by an archangel I think puts me much more near the position of being objectively correct. But who is the one under threat? The person who promulgates this and says I better listen because if I dont Im in danger or me who thinks this is so silly you can even publish a cartoon about it. And up go the placards and up go the yells and the howls and the screams Behead those! This is in London... this is in Toronto.... this is in New York.... Its right in our midst now Behead those! Behead those who cartoon Islam! Do they get arrested for hate speech? No.. Might I get in trouble for what Ive just said about the prophet Muhammad? Yes I might. Where are your priorities ladies and gentlemen? Youre giving away whats most precious in your own society and youre giving it away without a fight and youre even praising the people who want to deny you the right to resist it. Shame on you while you do this.,ChristopherHitchens,dd750ag,3,t5_2r9ah
