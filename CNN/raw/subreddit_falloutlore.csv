Everyone else that was is dead or a marked man I think he just knew about the package.Also the unknown markings are enclave I think.  Its mentioned that they are like per war Americas but different.And he didnt leave the legion and return he left the legion after the white legs failed to completely destroy new Canaan and all residents.  Also because they had begun to twist their hair into dreadlocks like his.  This saddened him because they didnt even know the significance of it.

The FEV at the Glow makes more sense then the supply at Vault . Even though the research was moved to Mariposa they didnt move all the FEV so it was left at West Tek to be guarded and they didnt move it all in time before the Great War.

Seeing as nuclear technology was used to power cars prewar how would survivors know how to create biofuel and convert wrecked cars to use it? Also how will you deal with the Arsenal ammunition factory within the canon? Surely such a large and incredibly useful plant would be the interest of groups like the Enclave or NCR?

1350077,0,t1_cil83io,One thing youre missing is that the NCR has no way to occupy the Mojave and enforce their presence without boots on the ground. The Rangers while powerful are few in number and represent the special forces of the Republic rather than their regular combat troops. Not deploying them until the conflict gained in intensity is smarter as veteran Rangers in the Mojave would be subject to attrition caused by Legion skirmishers saboteurs and commandos. Imagine if Rangers had a major outpost at Camp Searchlight and how many would die there. Furthermore while a lot can be said about Kimball and his favoritism of the Army he does not consciously want to kill Rangers or put them in harms way. Its Oliver who has issues with Hanlon and even with him Rangers ending up in a bad tactical position is a result of Olivers errors in planning and jealousy not deliberate attempts to kill them. Its also important to note that the Army will always be required. Even during the First Battle of Hoover Dam when the Rangers shone the bulk of the casualties were troopers at a ration of about  troopers dead for every  Ranger lost. This is also important to consider as its the troopers that made the greatest sacrifice but it was the Rangers and Hanlon who were celebrated.,falloutlore,ciliv5s,4,t5_2udux

1384246,0,t3_29nlgj,I might be wrong on this but I dont really see how the Sierra Madre tech is going to end up in the Mojave at all. Id like to stake my position not just to the facts of the lore but to what has always seemed to me to be the obvious thematic thrust of the lore.I thought the major point of Dead Moneyeven reinforced by the ingame realities of being unable to take much of the gold with you and being unable to returnwas that the new world had to let go of the Old World. The hardest part after all is letting go. The Courier isnt going back there to fetch all those machines and neither is anyone else. Letting go of the Old World was arguably the major theme running through the vanilla game and all of the addons.The conflict in the Mojave was fought by factions who looked backwards so much so that they hamstrung themselves with idiotic rules and regulations and ideas. All of them NCR Legion Khans Brotherhood House the Families etc. All of them were just shades husks of Old World ideas almost literally in Houses case. The only folks who seemed to be doing any good out there were the ones cutting ties with their past Enclave Remnants and the ones actively working to create a future Followers.Then in Honest Hearts you have Daniel and Joshua two opposing ideas for how to save the Zion tribals but both so rooted in Old World Mormonism that theyre unworkable. Joshua is the righteous wrath of God and Daniel is the bottomless forgiveness of God but neither one of them is able to actually look beyond his own vision to see whats best for the people they claim to be helping because their visions are those of the Old World. Additionally the tribals themselves have clipped their own wings by treating the Old Worldthe Father in the Caves the taboo placeswith undue reverence.Dead Money of course is Dead Money. It couldnt possibly be any clearer about its message Begin again let go.Old World Blues is a tricky one and it kind of depends on what your karma is and what ending you get but I think it does ultimately come down against Old World science. Pretty much all the endings seem to gently chide the idea of pining for what used to be and some of them are very clear that the technology of the Big Empty poses significant dangers while providing relatively little benefit. What does the Mojave really need after all with a ray gun that dissolves force fields? Does that somehow outweigh the potential scourge of roboscorpions? Even its nickname The Big Empty seems calculated by the writers to communicate the idea that Big MT was a place of great scientific sound and fury that ultimately signified nothing. Answers to the wrong question and all that.Finally Lonesome Road. Here you have Ulysses directly inveighing against House for fetishizing the Old World. And while he himself seems to have some misplaced fondness for prewar America he also doesnt have any illusions that prewar America is what postwar humanity needs. He specifically says that what the Divide could have been was NOT the America of old but something new and better.New Vegas is incredibly rich with ideas about past present and future about change about nostalgia about looking forward and about looking back and one of the most prominent of these ideas is the need for the people of the Wastelands to reject the Old World ideas that brought about the Great War in the first place. One of the lessons of OWB to me is that even if the Great War hadnt destroyed civilization science would have found another way to do it anyway.Thematically it just does not make sense to me that the Sierra Madre tech could ever leave the Sierra Madre.,falloutlore,cipsr0r,9,t5_2udux

And the subway systems and the heroic quest to find your father.I dont really object to any of those elements of FO. Ive often said its a lot of fun to play and the atmosphere is really cool. In an atmospheric sense they really captured the feel I thought. And the INITIAL form of the main questfind your fatheris fine. Then it takes a left turn into completely unbelievable nonsense about purifiers and time and space no longer make sense. Theres plenty about FO that isnt awful but theres so much that IS awful. Basically the game they were going to make the one that took place  years after the war would have been great. Everything they added to that game to shoehorn it into the wrong time period screwed it up.gtThe one thing I wish I could do in fallout games though is clean up the damn cities and towns and shit. I want to start a farm and start raising good crops with clean water and I mean jesus its been  years make a broom already and get to work.I would argue that the West Coast games make much more sense in that regard.

What they did was almost unprecedented in Brotherhood history. Something like that had not happened since the early days of the order. They had no way of knowing how Lyons would react to their leaving and theft of tech.Actually that is the antithesis of unprecedented it happened in a very similar fashion as the original split probably because Bethesda was rehashing many of the FO themes.gtGiven that they want him in front of a firing squad I think they could probably get past any familial feelings. Both sides have been radicalized by the split.I dont remember reading anything to that effect I know they want due process from the west coast chapter but the WC BoS already made a ruling on Lyons and it was just to cut support not cut all ties.Lyons and Rothchild  the two biggest members of lyons group arent radicalized their in game dialogue is quite neutral and regretful that the split occured with Lyons accepting blame.,falloutlore,cmbqorw,1,t5_2udux

Super Mutant Enclave it matters not. Surrender is not an option. Jamesongt Whats been going on? Well lets see. For years weve been draining our resources defending the ungrateful residents of this no mans land. Most of my best friends have either been ripped apart by Super Mutants or left to join the Outcasts.gt Here I sit in the safety of the Citadel while the people of the Wasteland thirst and suffer and die. Here I sit a failed feeble old man. What have I really accomplished? How many have I truly helped? The Super Mutants still roam rampant. The people still die of thirst and radiation. The Western Elders cease to acknowledge my existence. Some of my own people have even gone Outcast. And now... the Enclave. Technologically superior. Infinitely resourceful. The time has come to pass the mantle to more able hands. But is she ready? LyonsMost of Lyons chapter is long gone  either dead or Outcast. What he has are the vestiges of his organization. The Pentagon and Liberty Prime are the only real assets he has remaining before Project Purity gets retaken and then he squanders it. Rivet City is advanced thats the whole point. Its the only settlement in Capital Wasteland that has its own extensive agriculture fusion reactor regimented military science team proper economy on top of an actual government. This is what sets it apart. Its the only real settlement there  and its survival didnt hinge on the Brotherhood.Next asking for fair compensation isnt immoral nor does it affect how the wasteland perceives you. Im not sure where youre pulling that out of but Lyons really cannot afford to run a free delivery service for barrels of water. As stated above his organization is in ruin and he needs all the funds he can get. Hes too stupid to realize that though. Im not sure what you mean by supply and demand or improving quality of life. Water alone doesnt do that. Dropping off barrels of water doesnt do that. What does is teaching people how to survive helping them build and defend settlements rebuilding infrastructure that sort of stuff. None of which is something Lyons does.Thats the reason his chapter will be destroyed. For twenty years he destroyed it by forcing his men to wage a pointless war against the supermutants neglecting the people of the wasteland.

The only reason youd never see feral humans that way is that the amount of radiation necessary to fry out a ghouls brain would kill any human unless their body ghoulified in the process.So based on my knowledge of particle physics vis a vis Fallout lore Id say that its a matter of dosage. Plants draw in energy from the sunlight but can be fried by lasers. Similarly ghouls benefit from as much radiation as their bodies can handle but after you exceed that threshold theres problems.

3614216,0,t3_31rd4k,I always felt that the prewar medicines people still use are designed to deal with pretty much any illness. Medical science before the war was actually really advanced. Like uBobTehBoring said stimpacks can probably cure sickness and autodocs can do pretty much anything. Doctors in game always make their own medicine mixtures in syringes so they probably have tons of raw medicine ingredients we just dont see. I imagine most of it is prewar medicine too or at least based off of it. I bet there were cures for most anything before the war. So I imagine the doctors postwar can cure mostly anything too. The only thing now that seems incurable basically the post war worlds cancer is ghoulification. I remember in Van Buren there was supposed to be a horrible prewar disease called the New Plague that was going to be a big part of the plot. A scientist rediscovered it and was going to release it on the wasteland. I know a lot of lore from Van Buren was partially reused in  and NV.

Albert Speer is probably the best known proponent of this theory Ill mention he was a member of the Nazi Party during WWII his main task was planning the rebuilding of Berlin in the event of an AXIS victory.

3642124,0,t3_31u5te,I assume that the birds present in the Fallout games remain mostly unchanged as is due to general ecology of the birds seen. We can visibly see that vultures and ravens survived both of which opportunistic scavengers that could handle a nuclear winter. Pigeons can be seen in New Vegas loading art and they have a penchant at surviving concealed in buildings.Whats overlooked though is that a variety of other birds can be heard in Fallout. Especially Zion Canyon and Oasis in the CW. You can hear numerous songbirds and a variety of other avian life. It was actually kinda neat in Honest Hearts to go on to a mountain and actually hear a hawk screech and at night hear the occasional hoot of an owl.So birds as of  are actually doing quite well as an order of animals. Numerous songbird species and raptorial birds survive in North America. Theres most likely many more species not mentioned that still go on and I dont believe theres a chance in hell that someone somewhere doesnt own living chickens in  or someone owns fivefoot tall mutant ducks.As for why birds managed to stay alive through a nuclear winter unscathed? They have the predisposition for survival in any casescenario. Most are capable of flight which means they can cover large distances in search of food water or shelter. Birds lungsrespiratory organs are extremely effective at delivering oxygen. Shortages of oxygen at sealevel brought about by a dieoff in vegetation wouldnt immediately effect birds as hard as larger mammals. Of the bird species that survived theyre extremely adaptable organisms that can survive in difficult environments through a variety of conditions.Birds are just far too well adapted to perish in a Nuclear holocaust much the same as rats dogs and humans. Surely there are severe mutants somewhere but Im positive some lucky wasteland dwellers get to enjoy the birds singing or ravens squawking sometimes. TLDRBirds are really adaptable flying animals and because of that many can avoid death in a Nuclear Apocalypse and avoid mutagenic fallout and FEV.,falloutlore,cq7fh1y,1,t5_2udux
3676197,0,t1_cqaj73y,Yesss Vault  is my favourite.If you dont recall its the one where the vault inhabitants have to sacrifice one of their own each year. They were told theyd all be killed if they failed to do so. Actually failing to sacrifice someone wouldve resulted in the experiments success but the residents didnt learn that until the very end.Since the first overseer was the only one to know about the yearly sacrifices the enraged residents chose him as their first sacrifice. Eventually it became routine that the elected overseer would be the human sacrifice a year later which meant nobody wanted to be overseer. Groups formed power struggles ensued one of the biggest groups tried to force one of the female inhabitants to have sex with them or theyd elect her husband as overseer.

Cement and rebar can shift over time. Vault  with radroaches is in Virgina near the Potomac river. The area that composes the Capitol Wasteland is a swamp. Its humid. Metal rusts. If theres frost the soil will freeze putting stress on vaults. Earthquakes can cause cracks in concrete but those are rare and dont compare to the damage caused by the watershed. Roaches hatch from eggs inside of an ootheca like the mantises in NV but the roach oothecas are off camera. The roaches start out as nymphs when they hatch and gradually grow to their larger adult forms. Its plausible that after  years cracks have developed in vaults and hatchling radroaches are able to slip through. OP is right that roaches dont really dig.

Sure a NCR soldier can bring a shield to battle  before promptly getting shot by a legionaire with an hunting rifle and getting nailed to the cross. ,falloutlore,csp3y25,1,t5_2udux

4474674,0,t1_csuk42p,I like it. They would have to at least start allied as that is the only way Lyons BoS would let Arthur go to the commonwealth. If they started out fighting the Lyons BoS would just keep him on lockdown in the Citadel. So they could start allied and Arthur is sent as an intermediary and to learn to be a leader but due to too many differences the Lyons BoS and Midwest BoS end up breaking apart and then fighting over Arthur and we decide who wins. Arthur instead of being a unifying force is what drives them to fight as they each try to control him. Also if this is somehow amazingly the plot I think it would be cool that in the next game we get to see Arthur as an adult and his character is based off what we mold it to be in this game. ,falloutlore,csupcp2,2,t5_2udux

I mean the Courier could give the NCR the gold from under the Sierra Madre but I dont see that benefiting the NCR too much. They could use that to back their currency but theres no way that would be enough to stand as a backing to their entire currency. The thing about the cap is that its strong again primarily because of the inflation of the NCR dollar.The cap has always been a trustworthy currency so people still use it regardless of where they are. The NCR paper dollar could become strong again however if they succeed in the war against the Legion. Contrary to popular belief War isnt beneficial to economic growth primarily because what youre doing is funneling money into things that cant be used again like artillery shells bullets etc.. If the NCR can defeat the Legion theyll gain something more than just the Mojave. Economic stability will also be riding along there.

5005273,0,t3_3ghxkm,Im not sure OP. Obviously this is speculation but as it says Caesar will have his Rome. While it might not break the Legion yes taking it would be a massive strain. But consider this.Losing Vegas would be a tremendous blow to the NCR not totally in terms of resources although it would too be a massive drain on that but to its prestige. They have spent years pumping resources into the area. Kimball or if he dies his successor would have to grapple with the blow. Many of NCRs neighbors would quickly hear about the defeat and see them as weaker. Once an empire is proven to be weaker people will seek to exploit this. What might happen and more probably is the NCR would be hit with a wave of problems. The whole reason the NCR was expanding into the Mojave was for living space for its growing population. The issue has now been exacerbated as the army needs resources to recover whilst still supplying the population. Secondly politically it would cause upheaval in the NCRs military command and politically. Fingers pointing blame etc etc. A counter attack would not be viable in the short term. As for the rangers that would depend. If the NCR doesnt get tied up with a wave of opportunist attacks ie raiders which as several merchants say are a major problem they would need time to rebuild. Even then commiting Black ops isnt that straight forward. They need time planning resources and furthermore the Rangers future is uncertain. They too will ahve lost prestige and may face re organisation in the intermittent period. As for the legion. Perhaps with his new base Caesar may look to improve infrastructure in his Empire to connect it all to Vegas. The old saying all roads lead to Rome. Caesar being as he is would probably like to see this happen. So its likely he would spend time developing the infrastructure. Also as Rome itself found it needs to keep its soldiers busy so they dont revolt. With all the slaves from Vegas you may get huge slave farms or Lautinfundia essentially major plantations similar to those in the US form to fuel his army. Furthermore they have access to old NCR supplies that would be left behind and the Gun RunnersCrimson Caravan. While Caesar may reject modern technology I doubt he would be dumb enough to just ignore this. Will the NCR drive the Legion from Vegas? Maybe it would take a major concerted effort and take a long time to prepare all of which helps the legion. We know the NCR struggled to hold Vegas peacefully so a military offensive would be even more draining. What may happen is that Vegas becomes an ever shifting frontier as lang constantly changes hands. Essentially becoming a war of attrition. To those who say about the Legion thriving off conquest. While it does that doesnt mean it may remain that way. A major influx of wealth can be as changing as a major loss. I doubt the post Vegas Legion would remain like the pre vegas one. Post Caesar who knows. Maybe Lanius or another Legate would rule its unclear if Caesar has already lined up an heir. If they do they may struggle initially but if they could create the same cult of Personality ie son of Caesar thye may survive especially if they sire an heir. Legion could transform into more of a hereditary monarchy. Plus with constant war with the NCR would give people an enemy to unite behind. Ultimately we wont know but I think people are being harsh on the Legion.,falloutlore,cupbnrq,1,t5_2udux
5029850,0,t3_3jtxgs,Its not explicitly spelled out in New Vegas but the conflict was originally conceived for the cancelled Van Buren project. The Van Buren summaries pretty much place the blame at the feet of the Brotherhood specifically High Elder Jeremy Maxson. Before that point the Brotherhood and the NCR maintained fairly cordial relations but Maxson was an oldschool Brotherhood hard liner and he basically picked the fight with the NCR.Interestingly Ive always read the summaries in such a way that it was less about whether the NCR itself should have access to technology but more over how that technology should be used andor guarded by the NCR once they had access to it. Which makes me think the conflict may have specifically been about the NCRs expansionism. As the NCR spread to previous unexplored regions they were also exposing those regions to dangerous in the Brotherhoods eyes technology. I think its an interesting possibility at least that the Brotherhood might have been tentatively ready to accept the NCR as a enlightened and responsible agent in the aftermath of the war with the Enclave but they two groups came to blows over a philosophical difference over what that responsibility entailed.,falloutlore,cusaeoh,41,t5_2udux

5093415,0,t3_3kra2g,In terms of actual ingame lore the only detailed description of the GECK is from Fallout . As you say Fallout  treats it as a McGuffin were told in broad strokes what it was for and what the people of Arroyo believed it could do and that it did ultimately save the settlement but little about the thing itself. So going strictly by the letter of the lore Fallout s GECK is the oneandonly GECK until some future game says otherwise.That said Im firmly of the opinion that going solely by this logic is misleading. Fallout  doesnt give us many details about the GECK but the script is definitely treating it a certain way. The game contrasts the fanciful legendary stories of the Holy GECK handed down in Arroyo with what is clearly a rather more mundane bit of prewar technology. Thats clear in the Renesco quote you highlight hes clearly not that impressed by the thing. Regardless of what a replicator unit is the one in the GECK is basic. Were meant to appreciate the difference between the miracle that Arroyo believes it to be and the mundane for the Fallout world anyway reality.Given that its next to impossible to reconcile the Fallout  GECK with its Fallout  successor. The latter really is a miracle device even in the context of the game. Its almost certainly the most advanced bit of humanmade technology in the series. Even leaving aside the question of reconciling that with the rest of the lore on its face if the GECK can do everything Fallout  tells us it can do why is so much of the country still a wasteland? it doesnt contradict the letter of canon established in Fallout  but it sure as heck violates the spirit of it. If you take it at face value then the conclusion is that the inhabitants of Arroyo didnt exaggerate the GECK at all even though the game itself is fairly obviously signposting otherwise.In other words Bethesda most likely intended the Fallout  GECK to be the same thing as the Fallout  But the fact of the matter is that they superficially misread the story of Fallout  and the two GECKs theory is the easiest way to reconcile the depiction of the GECK in both games.,falloutlore,cuzy4bc,3,t5_2udux

That means that the American soldiers in China and the Brotherhood would have to restore the towers first. Assuming this is recently after the war the Brotherhood wouldnt be interested in doing that. They were and still are interested in collecting prewar tech not fixing it. So that means the Brotherhood wouldnt repair the radio towers and wouldnt try to communicate with them. Not to mention the Brotherhood most likely would not even know about the American soldiers in China. Specifically they wouldnt know if they were alive or not. Given how destructive the war was they most likely assumed the worst about them. There is no evidence suggesting they survived so there would be little reason to try and communicate with them. The American soldiers would most likely assume the same thing and would continue on with their lives. The Brotherhood of Steel also went AWOL before the war.

They wanted dungeons dungeons and more dungeons for players to play with. It worked with Oblivion so this was the Oblivion strategy applied to Fallout.It was the conventional wisdom of Oblivions era that gamers wanted loads of content because it was a new console generation and they HAD to deliver! Busywork! Locations! Quests! Sound familiar to anyone? We are going through the same phase again because developers felt they had to PROVE themselves for the new era of technology.So lots of content lots of graphics etc. Everything had to be amazeballs.More farms meant less content for gamers because that space could have been a dungeon. Fields of corn dont make interesting enemies.Well they can but you have to be Medievil playing Sir Dan Fortesque.Bethesda was ALL about quantity back then. Even if Oblivion had copy paste dungeons. Because they felt they had to really do something big for what were back then godly powerful consoles.Bethesda making a living world with an economy and supply lines is VERY recent.

Theres no motorized machinery of any kind for the field work theres no automation. In the Commonwealth the Sole Survivor encounters an array of crafty traders who have taken over prewar food packing and meat prep factories but ultimately even those people dont really know how to fix their own machinery. In the West food growth is more a result of some good luck good environments and a larger population. Theres an open GECK around a relatively protected vault which helps too.

Radiation in radioactive water actually comes from particles dissolved in the water so when the water evaporates the radioactive particles are left behind and the water precipitates as regular rain. Radioactive water was an issue in the Capital Wasteland because there was essentially no water cycle to naturally produce clean water therefore the need for Project Purity.Edit Notice that whenever it rains in Fallout  the Sole Survivor doesnt receive any rads yet when heshe goes swimming in a pond or lake heshe will gain rads at a consistent rate.

6876445,0,t3_49w8ns,I have the Fo artbook and the justification for T that it gave is basically that they wanted to do a visual reimagining of the T think Star Wars Original Trilogy Stormtroopers vs. New Trilogy Stormtroopers but the visual redesign took a life of its own and became distinct enough that they decided to make it the T.From a lore standpoint I could see it being a regional variant that was only entering production at the start of the Great War. IIRC when the United States was split into the Commonwealths Well use this handy map from the fallout wiki as a reference it was intended to create a regional government that would cover areas similar politically andor demographically that are larger than states but not fully involve the federal government. A potential result of this is that production and training of military equipment and personnel would be more decentralized and regional due to regional production bases having a stronger influence in their commonwealth and a relatively weaker central government.Basically the Commonwealth of New England which encompasses Boston and the Commonwealth in Fallout  had created their own regional variant of power armor possibly as a result of the Commonwealth Institute of Technologys research or just because they do not want to acquire rights to manufacture armor from outside of the Commonwealth out of regional stubborness or corruption. However this use of regional equipment by regional armies would put a massive logistical strain on the U.S. Military especially in foreign campaigns involving divisions from multiple commonwealths. It can be partially explained by U.S. government deploying entire regional armies rather than pulling random divsions from each Commonwealth. Such units would supply their equipment while the U.S. government provides the means to move and pay for their supplies.The BoS would have discovered the T as they entered the area of the Commonwealth of New England. The BoS also did not enter the Commonwealth guns blazing they did significant reconnaissance Brandis recon group was likely not the only one before their spectacular entry at the conclusion of Reunions. The Capital Wasteland is a not insignificant distance from the Commonwealth so it not being found until the years before the BoS entered the Commonwealth isnt unreasonable. These factors would have given ample time for the BoS to find and refit the majority of their troops with T.This idea of regional armies and equipment would also explain why the R Assault Rifle isnt present in Fo. The R would have been a weapon utilized by the Columbia Commonwealth which would explain its prevalence there. As to its appearance in Operation Anchorage either the troops involved in the Anchorage campaign were primarily from the Columbia Commonwealth or the designers of the simulation simply decided to use the regional weapon. The Anchorage simulation IIRC was intended to provide combat training the specific weapons used is likely not as important as the combat experience that troops would gain.,falloutlore,d0vrbj5,1,t5_2udux

In the case of the vertibirds I pilot is just the person who manages the flight systems and can take over if all other systems fail.In FO the vertibirds are much more traditionally designed with large glass cockpits for visual flights but also a center panel with instrument displays.

6937357,0,t3_4amunf,They dont have one thats very much the point that the writers were trying to make. In Fallout  theres never a right faction  each has their own flaws.. The Railroad are fighting for freedom but only care about synths theyve become so consumed by their organisations goals that they no longer care about anything else and would likely disband after they were done freeing synths. Their ending may be the only way to truly bring freedom to the synths but unlike every other ending they dont even pretend to offer a hope for the wasteland at large.. The Minutemen are noble and idealistic but also incompetent they were brought to their knees by foes such as a Mirelurk Queen or a platoon of Gunners something which a squad of Institute Coursers  to say nothing of a group of Brotherhood Paladins  would have no problems dealing with. While the player can make them somewhat competent its repeatedly suggested that when the player character leaves or dies the Minutemen will collapse exactly as they once did as the organisation relies on cult of personality.. The Brotherhood are oppressive neosocialistcollective feudalist bigots who are all the same probably the best hope for the Commonwealth to be brought to peace. They outgun even the Institute in terms of raw firepower and have the manpower and industrial capacity to conquer and secure the Commonwealth rendering it safe as they did the Capital Wasteland. They do after all seem to genuinely care about the lives of the people theyre fighting for and unlike the other factions they have the resources to make a difference. However the price of this is the uncompromising genocide of every ghoul synth and super mutant in the wasteland  and the game makes sure you know this by giving you Hancock Nick Danse and Curie all of whom the Brotherhood would want to exterminate.. The Institute may be on the surface the most evil of the factions  between the random murder slavery kidnapping terrorising of the Commonwealth and the horrific FEV experiments  but they also offer a chance for man to become something greater than himself a chance to ascend into a new higher form of existence to evolve beyond humanity. They summarise not only the dangers of reckless transhumanism but also its benefits.So theres my brief thesis on the factions and how they were intended to be seen by the writers. The point of Fallout  is that the game forces you to make a hard choice theres no Enclave Evil Brotherhood Good split like there is in Fallout  nor can you go about the Ill just become Emperor of the Wasteland approach that you can in New Vegas since its hinted that the Minutemen ending wouldnt change anything in the long term.This forces the player to ask themselves  do I choose freedom safety idealism or ascension? All of these are valid options and all come with very high prices. And these are if you ask me what makes the games writing truly great.,falloutlore,d12oduz,12,t5_2udux

Sure MM might loose their castle but over time those losses add up. And the BoS looses far more on a per body  tech count. Like I said. It becomes a bloody insurgent war. As for propaganda they can prolly get DC and BH and a bunch of farms. But goodneighbor is basically set for cleansing and theyd probably take issue with that. As would some of the residents in other areas who believe in freedom without exterior rule. Plus gunners and raiders are against them on principle. These are not weird and unexpected things. They are consequences of BoS policy that need to be factored in. As divided as the CW is if the BoS goes to war with all of it they risk inadvertedly uniting it against them  temporarily. Even without unity I earnestly do not believe even air superiority can win ground in such a scenario. Real life shows all too clearly how these things go. Long and bloody occupations that dont quite favor anyone. I am uncertain the BoS can keep this level of commitment up indefinitely.

7048563,0,t1_d1f9zef,It would make for a much more interesting game too. In my current playthrough on Survival Ive used Power Armor nonstop since you get the first suit during When Freedom Calls and I have NEVER ONCE run out of fusion cores. Ive never taken Nuclear Physicist or gotten the Repair Bobblehead Im now using X with a Jetpack and a gatling laser but Im still almost never using more power cores than I find. Theres nothing interesting about that. Fusion Cores are basically ammo now not some valuable lifeline that needs to be budgeted. Same with the power armor with it being so common its lost its value. You find it all over the damned place to the point where youre almost tripping over it. I think X was handled somewhat well with the exception of just being able to find it anywhere if youre high level enough due to loot randomization and being able to buy it from Rowdy. There is one spot I know of where X is guaranteed in Federal Surveillance Bunker KB. The catch? Its in the Glowing Sea which is an area that is nice and softlocked away from low level characters by constant radiation and insanely powerful enemies. If that were the only suit of X in the game Id have been happy. Nobody ever tells you its there no quest ever takes you to the bunker. You have to be high level and powerful enough to just be exploring the Glowing Sea for your own amusement and youre rewarded for it with a guaranteed suit of very good power armor.It was the same in the original game youre never required to join the Brotherhood and youre never told that the Save The Initiate quest will reward you with power armor. The only other way to get it is to A Have high enough repair skill to fix the broken set after joining the BoS or B Be powerful and skilled enough to steal the two suits from BoS storage and fight your way out. Both of those avenues are handled well theyre optional and they reward having played the game well and smartly.,falloutlore,d1fb9cc,2,t5_2udux

And in only one instance does the NCR push the followers out of Old Mormon Fort in the other ending where the NCR win the Followers grow and expand their services and are able to help even more people.gt If ghouls are so protected why is the newly ghoulified trooper in New Vegas afraid hell be shot on sight by his comrades? Why are they segregated into their own regiment? And why are mutants forced to live in Jacobstown and threatened by NCR soldiers even though theres an NCR outpost right nearby?Because there is still racism against ghouls from people who dont understand them and those who have experienced feral ghouls.

8209336,0,t3_4roay3,The only explanation for Nuka Cola still being common is that it was so popular Pre War that there are still bottles  years later. A little hard to believe but each machine usually only has one to six bottles of Cola in it. Most soda vending machines nowadays can hold around  bottles so I would guess that the Nuka Cola machines could hold the same amount. With a machine at every corner youre looking at thousands or even millions of bottles in a city like Boston DC or wherever. I suppose it isnt unreasonable that there would still be a few hundred bottles left in the wasteland spread around.As for Sunset Sarsaparilla there is a lore explanation for it still being common. The Star Cap collector who tracks you down mentions the legend of Festus refilling the machines but Festus is just a very simple robot greeter. However there is a terminal entry in the Sunset Sarsaparilla HQ that mentions a new robotic delivery system that can handle all of the Sunset Sarsaparilla deliveries completely by itslef including vending machines. We never see this robot in game but you can chalk that up to game engine limitations since the robot would have to be as large as a truck to move all those bottles. Plus if we saw it the player could destroy it and then the developers would have to make a script that stops SS bottles from spawning which would be more trouble than its worth. For those who want to read the entries here they aregt To Margie Walker Truckers Union RepSubject Bad newsBody Ill apologize up front if there are any mistakes in this message.

9288757,0,t3_56g1j1,Just some ad hoc numbers but in real life CocaCola makes something like  billion cases a year. The Fallout universe presumably never had a pushback against sugar and unhealthy habits in general and NukaCola operates effectively as a monopoly so we can probably at least double that estimate if not more like triple it. Either way somewhere in the range of  billion cases of Nuka being produced a year would mean hundreds of billions of bottles likely to be extant when the bombs dropped. Add to this the fact that the population of the world has been knocked down to maybe a few million where realistically any given region is likely to only have maybe tens of thousands of people at most and suddenly the prevalence of the stuff doesnt seem too outlandish. Of course it will run out eventually but maybe not for another  years. Throw in the advanced robotics and automation weve seen and its even further possible that billions more bottles were produced after the warthat is to say if a factory was fully automated and didnt get knocked out it might continue to output product until it completely ran out of resources to do so or otherwise brokeThe bigger question re NukaLore imo is how it seemingly keeps getting distributed. I think that wouldcould have been a cool opportunity for the series to establish either that there are robot couriers or maybe prewar ghouls that have become devoted to nuka and ensuring it stays distributed. ,falloutlore,d8tf0bc,2,t5_2udux

9451089,0,t1_d9dxtkz,That was fun. And while I cant explain away shitting your pants I can at least come up with a more plausible psuedoscientific explanation of Stimpaks RadAway and RadXFEV.One thing the lore of Fallout has continually done is expand on FEV. What was just in one vat in California is pretty much everywhere nationwide now and it was pretty much everywhere well before the war. FEV is some magical stuff. It can magically spread through the whole body in a mater of seconds rewrite DNA and rearrange body configuration in a matter of moments. It can be and has been modified to do all sorts of other crazy things. Hell if it can do all that maybe it can explain away shitting your pants too. So heres my headcanon on healing meds and more They contain a form of FEV and nutrients for it that targets only wounds and irradiated cells fixes the issue then deactivates... but doesnt necessarily fade away. Meaning that since the healing meds existed and were used before the war a lot of people primarily exmilitary likely had FEV already in their bodies at the start of the war and what with the fact that its a virus perhaps somehow spread a dormant form of FEV to their families pets and livestock possibly even to wild animals and plants. A dormant form that when exposed to enough radiation triggers ghoulification. Or causes extra heads to be grown on cows and deer. Or causes insects and arthropods to overgrow andor mutate. Or causes plants and trees to wither and die rather than thrive as they should have after the war. So there you have it. FEV is the main cause of pretty much every ill in Fallout other than the actual nuclear radiation. Thats the lore I go by. ,falloutlore,d9dzq7u,16,t5_2udux

A migrant community in a given area might suddenly find that theyve gone from being a minority in a city to being the majority in the village thats all that remains of the city. Thus their language and culture would be handed down more or less asis without a dominant national culture to absorb and homogenise it. The Spanish and Germanspeaking tourist groups who became the Sorrows and Dead Horses are an extreme example but its entirely plausible that theres English Irish Japanese or Russian communities out there from which the characters weve met originate. Adding to that we do see characters who are very deliberately preserving preWar cultures and languages  Patrick the Celt the Followers  or even reviving old cultures  Caesar teaching Latin to the Arizonans Mr House and The King reviving the spirit of th century Vegas  and well its clear that wasteland culture is resistant to blandness.,falloutlore,dc0htar,3,t5_2udux

Even with Vulpes efforts Caesar struggles to hold on to his domain as Lanius carves it apart into a neofeudal kingdom of his own making.Ultimately Caesar cannot take the strain of continued war and ruling dying of a stroke one night. A group of cynical Centurions aided by Vulpes use this opportunity to deify him overnight  and purge the camp of any hardliners. The Kalendian Purge became infamous among the ruling castes of the new Caesarea as was the subsequent proclamation of Caesars testament which promised manumission of slaves and establishment of a new order. No such testament was ever written but Vulpes and the Tetrarchy used Caesars newly established divinity to push through reform that could never be established.The fledgling dictatorship builds on the solid foundations created by the Legion and evolves into a fullon tribal empire. The frontier struggle with Lanius kingdom is brutal and bloody but where the Tetrarchy has charisma and the legacy of Caesar behind them as they shaped it Lanius has naught but violence and brutality. His domain collapses with his death  although NeoLanii try to keep it together it eventually disintegrates.Caesarea becomes a vital trading partner of FEZNV and through it the New California Republic. Though brutal by New Californian standards and particularly unforgiving by any other it manages to stabilize the situation and become a rising power  even more so after the Tetrarchs establish familial ties with the Great Khans who migrated northwest to carve out an empire of their own.,falloutlore,dffv6rd,6,t5_2udux
11361623,0,t3_613u4u,NCR has repaired working automobiles and I wouldnt be surprised if motorcycles were a thing too on the west coast. Trains are definitely a thing in the NCR and expanding eastward by New Vegas. Boats in working condition dont seem to be uncommon either as we see them in Fallout  Point Lookout Fallout  and especially Far Harbor. Also Monorails in Las Vegas and Nuka World.Theres also the Boomers B depending on the path you take. ,falloutlore,dfjthi4,3,t5_2udux

11700585,0,t3_66yjx8,Its believed the car  is an older model that had been retrofitted with a nuclear powered engine at some point similar to the pickup trucks also found in New Vegas.,falloutlore,dgma38z,2,t5_2udux
11704325,0,t3_66z330,The Masters mutants are the best. He was the only one interested in using mutation to actually evolve humanity so he made an effort to perfect his creation of mutants and learn what factors led to its success. He also presumably turned them into better soldiers given he formed them into an army.No other group had his inclinations or intelligence. The Enclave just wanted to excavate Mariposa and the mutation of their slaves was accidental. The Vault  mutants are almost entirely morons so they would seem incapable of mastering the mutation method. And the Institute... I forget why they were making mutants but they werent interested in creating a mutant master race either.,falloutlore,dgmpd8h,8,t5_2udux

He had multiple cybernetic enhancements both mental and physical plus almost a century of experience.Its possible that Coursers are better physically it really depends on exactly how much Kelloggs cybernetics enhance him as opposed to just fixing being very old.But as far as experience training tactics and general prowess in combat I think Kellogg will be better than any Courser.,falloutlore,dgr1ert,67,t5_2udux

11789167,0,t1_dgw1t0x,I mean it makes sense but I dont think bicycles were in wide use outside of children and maybe the occasional city slicker. Due to the US of the fallout timeline sticking to an economic system where the Nuclear family and Suburbs stayed as the majority way of living by far bikes were likely not used as much as they are IRL,falloutlore,dgwcba0,2,t5_2udux
