That being said once I listened to it again I absolutely fell in love with the album because my expectations were gone and I just sat and enjoyed.Differently to you during my first listen I HATED his harder hip hop songs.  I never wanted to listen to Mixtape again.  The gospel stuff were the songs I loved.  The more and more I listen to the tape the more and more I love it because of his lyricism and the great beats.  Its different than his other stuff and hes changed but I definitely see why people may not like it as at first I didnt.,ChanceTheRapper,d35rc3o,23,t5_2vaja

9061305,0,t3_54awg7,So here are my overall thoughts incase anyone was wondering. Definitely could have been organized better uzi was like mins late and thugger didnt even show up dont blame chance but i wish that didnt happen. Overall all of the acts were amazing everyone had good sets and interacted with the crowd well .  The crowd wasnt as hype when chance was out kind of seemed like he was disappointed when no one was getting hyped with him but I was screaming the whole time he had an awesome set.  The artist choice could have been a bit better I didnt see why alicia keys or skrillex were there i felt like they didnt fit the theme well but thats just personal opinion.. Also i finally got to see ye live and that was just crazyIf theres another MCD like event Ill definitely attend but Id make sure to get seats in the pit next time as my seats didnt make it feel like a big concert more like a viewing and i wasnt much of a fan of that. Id give my experience a  really solid experience but does have some issues i feel like they should work on.,ChanceTheRapper,d810u92,5,t5_2vaja

10944738,0,t1_de8dy92,I agree with everything except the first sentence. I was never making the argument that HHH is representative of most hip hop. I was saying I thought this particular subreddit would have a better understanding like you clearly do than HHH.Im very aware that Theyre into that fine niche that they think is true rap or whatever. Like their hatred for Yachty. Dude is killing the game and all HHH can say is oh his bars are trash or he only mumbles. Whenever it doesnt fit their narrative they just assume it will fail like CB.,ChanceTheRapper,de8vf2t,1,t5_2vaja

11648295,0,t1_dggcdhk,Yes! Common loved Gil Scott Heron and I think he introduced him to Kanye. They sampled one of his songs on the track My Way Home from Late Registration. I dont know if Kanye knew much about Heron before this  definitely possible but if not I feel this was a major reason he sampled Comment  on MBDTF.Glad to hear youre enjoying the album!
