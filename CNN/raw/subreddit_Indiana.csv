102725,0,t1_ceq3w79,Making children is no longer dependent purely upon sexual reproduction. New may or may not be better but we have to also deal with and consider new.gt No. But when the real parents are unavailableThis comes with the assumption that only heterosexual couples make good parents I assume. Good is a subjective term which I find has a meaning that is debatable. Your good and my good may differ greatly or slightly. gt No it you just want it to be a misstep.You want to claim that only heterosexual couples are the only thing we can call good parents just as much as I challenge that idea. You want it to be that only one man and one woman make good parents. You refuse considering anything but that. You have said so yourself. Is there any other reason to disallow nonhetero marriages to occur?

Id actually be interested to see the paper but thats neither here nor there.Ultimately I dont think its a question of what the minimum wage was meant to be.  I think its a question of what we owe people who work for a living.  Did you see the article about how the poor should wither off and die from a senate candidate?  Search poor wither off die indiana sans quotes and you should find it.  Take your pick of fair to middlin sources.  Its been published enough places in the same format that I can take it as a verbatim quote even with those sources.The article set me off but what really concerns me is that there are actually people out there who think that seven or eight dollars an hour is enough to make a living.  Assume you have a republican twoparent family.  Both making minimum wage.That wont feed two kids unless youre paying Detroit prices for housing in which case you have even bigger problems.I think were on the same page at the end of the day.  There needs to be a floor below which people cannot be exploited.  An honest days work deserves an honest days pay whatever that work happens to be.Im not a resident of Seattle but Im honestly not sure their new minimum wage is enough to successfully raise a kid or two.  I work from home so  hours for me   hours  commute for the average worker roughly.  But that commute costs more than gas.  It costs time with your family be it one person or twelve.If I was actively looking for work beyond the awesome situation I have Id have to drive  minutes each way to Indianapolis.  Its either that or  hours to Champaign and to hell with that.  Gas aside Id like to be able to have time to tell my wife I love her before I pass out.

So the Muslim man was allowed the ability to grow his beard to a certain length an inch and a half irc to honor his faith and not pose a potential threat to guards. Meanwhile the church could participate in a program to feed the homeless because where as the average Joe wouldnt be able to just set up a kitchen in a public park and hand out food. Something to that degree...The issue that I have with these examples is that they are sugary examples of religious freedoms being allowed. A man growing his beard does nothing to restrict another persons rights. A church group feeding the homeless may encourage more homeless to hang around that area for a time but really doesnt restrict the freedoms of others.
