4455902,0,t3_3c4a5c,Weve all had that moment when we call a contact centre to get something resolved and were passed from one department to another to another to another when finally you get to that one person who actually does want to help you and is appalled by how you have been treat up until that moment.When I was working in a contact centre I tried to be that person. I would refuse to pass a customer off unless I was absolutely certain that the department I was transferring them to would be able to resolve their problem. I would do warm transfers explain the situation in detail and they would either take the call or advise me on what I should do. Some of the time this involved out of hours work hanging around at work for an hour in order to give the customer a call back when I had received the appropriate information.uknthing doesnt seem to understand that at least from the perspective of the users and apparently the mods assuming this is true Victoria was that person. Being told to message the admins or send an email to is exactly what I described above  passing the buck. There doesnt seem to be any intention to actually assist only to shirk responsibility to those who have access to an email account.Personally the few dealings that Ive had with the admins have always been swift and painless and I absolutely have reservations about this image Im not ruling out that I just dont understand the modmail layout  the damn thing is a mess but if this is legit... man you just dont get it dude.Fakeedit well this was a hell of a lot longer than what I initially wanted to say. Oh well.,ShitTheAdminsSay,csscka4,7,t5_32din
4489609,0,t1_csvjl4o,gt Are people on these subs signing pledges to punch a fatblack person in the face? Or are you saying that simply by having a hateful attitude they are guilty of harassment even if they keep it amongst themselves?No. But when you see asylum seeker accommodation centres being burned down where do you think people like that came first into contact with those ideas at? But lets go back to the internet Of course most of the fph people only uttered things like found the fatty. But some of them went further publicly shamed people threatened people. Things that happen all over the internet I know. Ive had to read one or the other nasty PM on the internet I dont really care. That doesnt mean that other people dont care. Its just a question of common decency to voice your opinion in a civilized manner like we are doing right now and not let people feel scared. And I know just because someone behaves uncivilized doesnt mean they should be banned. But I think the sub had reached critical mass the admins didnt disclose what kind of messages they were sending to people so we might not even know the worst of it. You could debate when it is you are going too far when attacking somebody on the internet. Did you go too far when you tell somebody to kill themselves? Did you go too far when you tell them youll kill them and you know their address and you live  hour away? Did you go to far when you were probably the last straw that made a suicidal person commit suicide? Did you go too far when you send a SWAT team to someones house or get them arrested? Btw Im not saying fph did that but they probably did some of the milder things Im just asking is all of that really necessary? And does a website has to accept a community whos primary goal is to do those kind of things?Sorry for the double message.,ShitTheAdminsSay,cswkrpv,1,t5_32din

9824618,0,t1_dao3yay,gtIt does get weird when the offending sub is a large home for a major party candidate and now presidentelect.gtHowever one of the big problems with TD is the circle jerk nature of it. I was banned for questioning his transition team. Thats not a discussion thats cheerleading.But where do they ever suggest that the Donald is forum for discussion? There are other related subreddits for that. gtMaybe if there is going to be special consideration made for a subreddit then they should have more restrictions. TD would be less toxic if they were unable to ban everyone that even slightly disagrees with them. Giving them a free banhammer is making that sub into a completely closed echo chamber.And now we have risen to the level of every subreddit with varying ideology from the point of view of the individual telling the story. Plenty of subreddits do that some for even stupider or superficial reasons. Subreddits are digital fiefdoms by design. gtIts going to keep getting worse IMO. They already feel untouchable because they think they have political protection. But reddit can leave them open but take away their ability to ban for reasons OTHER than sitewide rulebreaking. Is that unprecedented? Yes but so is Trump and this associated subreddit that is clearly out of control.Maybe its because they havent broken any rules. gtwhat they could do is allow banned users to appeal not to the mods of TD but to the admins of reddit. Multiple overturning of admin decisions on unbanning could lead to mod removal. This would let the community get in there and temper it a bit with some facts and reality. Right now its a runaway circus on full volume with its foot all the way down on the gas.Thats not how it works. You dont get to change long standing rules just because the topic or participants dont think or believe what you do. gtReddit inc has to do something. No they really dont. Literally nothing you suggest is any different than any number of a dozen subreddits. The Donald is unique in lots of ways but banning logic and freedom to create a totally open forum or echo chamber is their right. ,ShitTheAdminsSay,dao62i0,3,t5_32din
