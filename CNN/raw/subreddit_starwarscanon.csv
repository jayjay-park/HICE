7488406,0,t1_d2tdpqq,Ive not played any of them Ive been waiting for a fresh start with canon material. From what the article says does this look like new gameplay or could somebody like you whos played the others pick this up and play without reading the rulebook to this set? I guess Im trying to determine if Fantasy Flight Games has officially transitioned into canon material after this release or if this is a one time thing.,starwarscanon,d2te3nz,2,t5_35dih
7495937,0,t1_d2tuqsc,You know its odd but I genuinely cant remember how it was handled either was it even handled or was it just brushed over?.And the way the book handles it makes it seem really odd that old EU would have just shrugged and been like yeah alright to such news it would be like it coming out that Angela Merkel was the daughter of Heinrich Himmler or something there is no way that it wouldnt be a career enderspoiler.  ,starwarscanon,d2u8yrp,4,t5_35dih

I picked up the individual TPBs but I do prefer bigger collections so Ive been trying to find it in shops near me to have a look at how it compares as the only images online are the cover.

8584815,0,t1_d6eodbv,Its a generalized fear. There are a million ways they could screw up and a much smaller number of ways they could get it right. I really want to trust them like I trust Marvel Studios but they havent earned that yet.I guess one glaring example would be if Ben Mendelsohns character is presented as the guy in charge of overseeing the Death Stars construction with no mention of Tarkins role in it. I doubt theyd do that but you never know. Im definitely going to reread Tarkin just before seeing Rogue One.,starwarscanon,d6eot8a,1,t5_35dih
8810133,0,t3_50tsve,This is still my favorite Del Rey novel in the canon. I prefer the pure actionadventure books and this one also has a great cast of characters. Kanan and Hera already had fleshed out personalities planned for Rebels but John Jackson Miller gave life to his new creations from Count Vidian to the now fanfavorite Rae Sloane all the way down to minor characters. The audiobook is also one of if not the best. Marc Thompsons wide range emphasizes the distinction of the characters unlike a certain bland trilogy which I wont even name. I was confused a lot the first time I read Tarkin but in A New Dawn I always knew what was going on and was never bored. JJM doesnt force his personal opinions into Star Wars and respects everything that came before as well as leaving upcoming titles open to future writers but he still finds a way to make a mark in the overall universe. I think this is the perfect book to start over and a great first book for any new readers.,starwarscanon,d76uwl1,7,t5_35dih

10120664,0,t1_dbq24xb,ulinatrinch I apologize you had a bad experience here that is not our goal here on rStarWarsCanon.  There are some who felt it was appropriate to talk about Leia as a character in this context and some that felt that topic should wait. I dont fault uTheyMightBeGeeks for feeling different than myself and I hope you dont either. But here we are committed to a different kind of conversation a specialized conversation that focuses on all the elements that contribute to the Star Wars Canon the story of Star Wars. So I hope youll give us another chance here and consider resubscribing and contributing. We all love Star Wars we all love Carrie and we all love Leia. ,starwarscanon,dbqqa9q,3,t5_35dih
10204225,0,t1_dc0bm67,Looking forward to Thrawn too!!! Ive avoided the Thrawn Trilogy mainly bc Im just avoiding Legends but specifically bc I dont want to mix Legends Thrawn with Canon Thrawn.

10264651,0,t1_dc7h08l,Well according to Pablos other tweets theyve basically decided that all travel takes between a day and a week at most. I hate that for many of the reasons you mentioned along with the fact that it makes the Galaxy seem too small. I mean I guess I can excuse it seeming like trips dont take long in the movies but in the Books amp Comics they still talk about trips taking days or weeks.,starwarscanon,dc7jyh3,9,t5_35dih

10454507,0,t1_dct43zk,In a way they still did that though. We dont get to see it. We may see some small flash backs but the building of his first academy will already be in another book or movie anyways. Not to mention if he does survive then the second academy will have to be built after ep . So no matter what we still would have ended up with the same problem. Now I agree it wouldnt do to have him doing nothing for that long but having him fail so spectacular on top of having han going back to smuggling and having leia back leading a underfunded resistance just feels like setting everything back to square one. Im hoping against hope that jedi is plural and its more than just rey and luke. ,starwarscanon,dct4eyu,5,t5_35dih

11422560,0,t3_62r29n,I agree this is probably one of the best timeline charts Ive seen. Good job OP!The only thing I think you might have gotten wrong is the placement of the Adventures in Wild Space entries which might take place sometime in  BBY or later because spoilers for The Stealthe Bridger transmissions are already a thing during the events of the book and supplementary material states they didnt start until  BBY. This might not be your fault since the books are kind of unclear too like a possible continuity error where spoiler for The StealEzra is still a baby in The Steal but I thought itd mention this.,starwarscanon,dfqqhtd,2,t5_35dih
