4477336,0,t3_3cfl4c,Whats your opinion on coin vs. relic start? I prefer tanky Thresh so I usually start relic but the gold outcome is a lot higher on coin which seems to make it a better buy just that you are a lot squishier early? Your opinion? p,ThreshMains,csv1d4j,1,t5_37x71

6891796,0,t1_d0x61rn,this only reason why i dont spam thresh in ranked. I reccomend zil you can either roflstomp lane depending on the matchup or bomb poke so your adc can free farm then mid to late you dont allow anyone to feed and you have very good utility.,ThreshMains,d0xi46t,1,t5_37x71

7022081,0,t3_4bs63x, I think this match up is actually pretty even. There is some good counter play between both Braum and Thresh. The major weakness Braum has is he is vulnerable to poke early on. Because he is a melee champ it is pretty easy to punish him when he is out of position. You are able to use you flay to disrupt his dash and keep him in a disadvantageous position. Using your CC to control his positioning is the key component to the counter play against Braum.  I like taking exhaust in this match for this line of reasoning it allows you to have more CC to control the positioning of Braum in lane. Punish him and do everything you can to manipulate his  positioning. ADs with early game presence are good because you are able to poke Braum down early to gain a lane advantage. An AD who can out duel their opponent is also ideal. Secondly ADs that are able to manipulate the positioning of Braum synergies well with this lane strategy.

7968709,0,t3_4oe01g,You should always go Thunderlord when youre against a squishy comp and are looking to kill them bond is good if you cant usually win trades Like you would have a Vayne or Lucian vs Caitlyn you usually wont be able to trade and get outpokedI always go thunderlords just because I use ignite  of the time so it gives me more kill pressure Hope this was helpful Im not great at matchups yet so sorry if i couldnt explain everything also not a native English speaker.Edit Wording,ThreshMains,d4brbeg,2,t5_37x71

10105649,0,t3_5kasvn,I feel like unless they nerf it Redemption is a musthave for supports especially Thresh. The sustainheal he lacked before are now available in a g item and the min CD means its pretty much up for most teamfights.Along with that item I tend to build SightstoneMobiLucidity FOTM FHLocket depending on enemy comp and the last slot is for control wardswhatever situational item I may need usually the other tank item I didnt built first FH or Locket. As for keystone CotC allows for better trades in lane and for surviving in general. Also never forget the  crit rune. I tend to be lucky. ,ThreshMains,dbos094,2,t5_37x71

10867914,0,t3_5vcbbj,With the way stacking bonuses work for shields and heals I find FoTM and locket and in most of my builds.

10989878,0,t1_dedn977,Ok so it does nothing. Big deal. The shield is far more important for the team than whether the most expendable role has some extra MR or not. Thresh belongs in team fights. In taking objectives he doesnt really have an impact. If he can win his team a fight with a good engage and keep them healthy with the shield from locket then even if he dies because of inefficient stats the team can then towers dragon Baron etc because they won the fight.,ThreshMains,dedo1yy,4,t5_37x71
