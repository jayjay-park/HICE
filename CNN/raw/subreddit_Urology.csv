7599554,0,t3_4hxl0u,This is like asking why are we still cutting people open to do surgery? or why do we still have to biopsy tumors? Its because its the current state of the art and we dont have anything better yet. What would you propose be done instead of a flexible cystoscope to diagnose disease? Urologists do use contrast CT scans but they are not  sensitive and may miss some lesions plus they expose patients to radiation. MRIs are better but still not entire diagnostic but are being utilized more and more. In the end while the flexible scopes may be somewhat uncomfortable they are relatively low risk and the most accurate diagnostic tool we have. I understand your frustration. Uretheral strictures are stubborn and tend to want to recur  or more do recur. And youre right treating them surgically can cause more scar tissue to reform in fact making the stricture worse. Im sorry youve had to go through so many painful procedures. Until we understand more about strictures and why they form however surgical treatments will be the mainstay.,Urology,d3614uj,1,t5_2thwv
