11270,0,t3_1u84aj,Last game I played before Christmas was pretty bad. Id had a few weeks out for one reason or another so coming back was shifted down from the second to third team. Despite the fact that we had  subs on the teamsheet posted to facebook only  players turned up. I was down to play  which I love and ended up playing at  and  I havent played in the backs for the last  years. Which was understandably shit. Worst thing was that I didnt even put in the worst performance as we lost  our only try scored by the player the opposition gave us after our winger got injured in the first minute.Im having surgery to fix my shoulder in the next few weeks so its quite likely that that was one of my last games of rugby this season. Hopefully I can put in a few more decent performances before then and the recovery wont take too long but well see.

301335,0,t1_cfbzyrv,ampampamp Fergie Time gtThe concept of Fergie time stems from Manchester Uniteds reputation for scoring important late goals notably in April  when Steve Bruce scored in the th minute to clinch a  win for United against Sheffield Wednesday which set up Uniteds first league title since  and the  UEFA Champions League Final in which United scored two stoppage time goals to defeat Bayern Munich . The phrase itself dates back to at least  when a Guardian journalist wrote of Fergietime that special allowance when United are behind. Added to this was the suggestion from some quarters that extra time added in matches United were losing was a result of Fergusons intimidation of matchday officials. Ferguson later acknowledged that he did try to pressure referees into adding more stoppage time.gtInteresting Alex Ferguson | The Black Eyed Peas | Shane Ferguson | Glossary of association football terms ureddititis can delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecfbzzhd.

He certainly isnt celebrating like Zebo for one.I am interested to see how he does in s myself mainly as most of my friends who follow Rugby think hes some kind of force to be reckoned with.  Whilst Id concede that he does run around pretty much everyone hes played against those gaps are that much smaller in s and from what Ive seen of his highlight reels he does not like to go straight through gaps you almost always see him running out to the side.That said toss him on the wing for a bit of kick and chase seems right up his alley.,rugbyunion,cfic0jf,1,t5_2qkbe

709020,0,t1_cgkv0cv,There is the point to be made that some other are making of creativity. While there is a great talent pool in English rugby the Premiership doesnt have diverse enough competition to inspire great creativity just some really fast players and some really big players. This under a good coach can work out really well in international rugby so long as you have the fastest and biggest men. I was recently watching rugby in France and this was their main complaint about English rugby that it was boring bit of a glass houses coming from anyone who likes the top  but well let that slide. In internation club rugby you need to be able to do something a bit more. Something surprising. Danny Care provides this for the Harlequins but this is exactly what Im not seeing from Saracens. The closest thing I see is a quickly taken line out every once in a while. But all in all they play a pretty boring brand of rugby and theyre not getting the competition in the Premiership to encourage them to play more interesting rugby baring Harlequins and I suppose Northampton on their day but I think they also play a foul brand of rugby that shouldnt be encouraged.,rugbyunion,cgkvadx,1,t5_2qkbe

720873,0,t1_cgm75al,It is absolutely racist in a number of ways.Firstly and most plainly its racist because it discriminates against those who arent Black or Previously Disadvantaged. Simply by being White or nonBlack you are being discriminated against regardless of ability or background.Its racist secondly as it infers that Black players are unable to achieve selection without Government intervention. It undermines every capable athlete in the country like giving a bicycle to a marathon runner. This is one of the most problematic aspects of such legislation in my eyes as it hurts the nonwhite talent that is there. It means that no matter how good a nonwhite player is there will always be the doubt in the mind of the athlete and the general public at large that they are literally making up the numbers.It also ignores the possibility that there are underlying reasons that black players might not be achieving representation in certain sports other than race. Black players are the overwhelming majority in Football Soccer in South Africa far beyond equal representation to population so to my eyes this legislation is either saying that the South Africa Rugby Union and by extension Oregan Hoskins and his entire staff is racially discriminating against nonwhite players that should be being picked OR that for whatever reason there arent enough nonwhite players making the grade and so there must be TopDown legislation to force nonwhite players into the squad. Both options are ridiculous and extremely damaging.Socially speaking Rugby has always had strong roots amongst the White Afrikaner boarding school community in the same way that many of Asian ethnicity from KwazuluNatal enjoy cricket. The reasons for this are many and socially complicated in the case of Cricket it is a far more popular sport in South Asia than Football is in say the rest of Africa and it can be generally accepted that differences will always exist. Is it a surprise that a lot of white Afrikaners play rugby? No it isnt and I dont think it could be argued with any credibility that they are selected based on race. I cant think of many teams in the world who given the options wouldnt have Bismarck du Plessis Eben Etzebeth Willem Alberts and Duane Vermeulen in their pack if given a chance. Based on this the pack is  white so who is going to lose their place based on politics? Its so ridiculous and quite possibly illegal in terms of competing in other countries and international tournaments it doesnt even warrant serious argument  this should be dismissed out of hand by the international community. Does such legislation do anything to improve the national standing in such sports? No. It goes against the very nature of sport and introduces a level of politics which has no place there. If the aim of this was for nonwhites to have more opportunity then the changes need to be at grass roots. Give every child the opportunity to try sport and make sure that there is equal opportunity. Do not discriminate by race at all judge everyone on merit alone not hair eye or skin colour. On the field there is no socioeconomic background there is only the ability and attitude of the player and this is the only means by which a player should be advanced or selected. Im ashamed and disgusted to be associated in any way with the soapboxstanding political racketeering of greedhungry politicians announcing such divisive headlinegrabbing ideology exactly a month before a general Election. Its everything that sport is not.I for one would happily see SARU disqualified from the IRB for legislation such as this. Its backwards it damages everyone it helps no one it undermines the competitive nature of sport itself and it shouldnt be happening in .If we want to make progress lets address the issue. Lets go to the schools lets see why nonwhites arent making it through the structures to elite level lets see why certain sports arent as popular lets see how we can remove socioeconomic background as a barrier for participation lets use funding where it is needed to encourage and give the opportunity to those who dont have it at the moment. Implementing quotas is not the way to do this.editsome grammarspelling,rugbyunion,cgm7t0y,132,t5_2qkbe
721503,0,t1_cgmadjr,ampampamp Bantu Education Act  sfw gtThe Bantu Education Act  Act No.  of  later renamed the Black Education Act  was a segregation law which legalised several aspects of the apartheid system. Its major provision was enforcing racially separated educational facilities. Even universities were made tribal and all but three missionary schools chose to close down when the government no longer would help support their schools. Very few authorities continued using their own finances to support education for native Africans.  In  this type of education was extended to non white universities and colleges with the Extension of University Education Act and the internationally prestigious University College of Fort Hare was taken over by the government and degraded to being part of the Bantu education system.  It is often argued that the policy of Bantu African education was aimed to direct black or nonwhite youth to the unskilled labour market  although Hendrik Verwoed at the time Minister of Native Affairs claimed that the aim was to solve South Africas ethnic problems by creating complementary economic and political units for different ethnic groups.gtgtImage iInteresting Bantu Education Department | Apartheid | List of Acts of the Parliament of South Africa  | Racial segregation Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcgmadwn oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecgmadwn.

In saying that odds are the ABs will lose a couple of tests this year.Im not to concerned about Hooker  I like what I am seeing with Coles and Coltman at Super level.  More concerning is Midfield particularly centre  Conrad Smith is the number one in this position but no viable backup has been found.  It seems as if Fekitoa will get the run here at some point.  nd  is less troublesome when you factor in SBWs return and that Carter in a pinch can play there.

983648,0,t3_25coa2,Cracking the lineout calls.  If its a tryout game theyll be simple calls because the team would be thrown together at the last minute probably a magic number.  Find the number and watch the jumpers.  Often it will be something like    Blue with one digit being the magic number its almost never the first or last digit so start remembering where they jumped and what the number was.  Typically the magic number will work like this   First pod fakes forward goes back   First pod goes straight up   First pod fakes back jumps forward   Second pod fakes forward goes back   Second pod goes straight up   Second pod fakes back jumps forward   Third pod fakes forward goes back   Third pod goes straight up   Third pod fakes back jumps forwardAnd the alternate at the end is often either a drive or off the top.  You could have a double number as a special move so be ready for that but you can usually crack the calls within the first  minutes or so depending on how many lineouts you have.  Regardless of if you have it or not call where you think its going over the lineout call so the other teams lineout cant hear their calls.  It takes four people working together to make a lineout work so if you screw one of them up theres a good chance for a steal.Good luck dude kick some ass,rugbyunion,chg3kar,2,t5_2qkbe

Tuilagi should never have been shifted to the wing I reckon. I see what they were trying to do but he was wasted out there. However that first quarter of the second half showed what I expected of the matches initially. NZ storming ahead and England struggling to match the pace eventually. Before it turned into an arm wrestle again. So. I was quite surprised with  how theyve turned out but that isnt exactly a bad thing. Im glad I was wrong. ,rugbyunion,ci9kilh,2,t5_2qkbe

1291571,0,t1_ciery4e,Twelvetrees proved himself on the Argentina tour last year which is why he ended up on the Lions tour.The question isnt whether he needs to go back to the Saxons to prove himself. He has nothing to prove on that front.Its whether he has the consistency at top test level and also whether he can get on the wavelength of his  and outside backs. On both counts Twelvetrees comes unstuck drifting in and out of games failing to break the line AND make the pass or not getting the ball through behind the defence.This is Lancasters conundrum  go with safer options in Barritt or Burrell at  who probably wont hit the highs more flair players like Twelvetrees or Eastmond can or go with players whose peakstroughs will be more pronounced.As for May? Explosive speed but lacks so much in terms of when to come in for work or when to take the man on the outside and his defence is suspect. Compare against Ashton who runs fantastic support lines but is otherwise pretty suspect.This is why England are still looking hard at Watson and Yarde and will welcome Nowell and Wade back into the squad when fit. May has had enough chances and hasnt shaken the feeling his decision making isnt good enough.

I would much rather this money being spent developing the game and keeping our top players here in NZ then wasting it on games like this. The IRB are responsible for helping out the smaller unions.

1587735,0,t1_cjf8py9,I can see your point.  Consider this....aIf the ball carrier has one knee or both knees on the ground that player has been brought to ground.Palus left knee goes to the ground and McCaw at that point is onside by at least a foot. Palu falls on his face and rolls over to present the ball.  Thats when it looks like McCaw is coming in from a bad angle. It is obviously open to interpretation and the speed of the game makes it a difficult call.  I think Palu was isolated and the advantage was in favor of the Crusaders at that point.  i would have liked to see the ref let the play go a bit longer to see what would come of it. ,rugbyunion,cjfb01y,1,t5_2qkbe

He showed in his short time with the Crusaders that he still has a very decent turn of pace and acceleration. I agree that Barrett and Cruden are putting serious heat on him but I still think he has a decent chance at being the ABs  for the world cup next year largely due to his experience and cool head as well as physical skills. is a crucial position and the All Blacks of all teams have seen that while exciting playing style and a lot of natural talent is certainly helpful in the biggest of big matches it is often the experience and cool heads that win it. I think back to  when we had all the possession we needed to get a win in the quarter final but lost our cool a bit when the game plan wasnt working.I have faith in Barrett and Cruden and to an increasing degree Slade though at international level may be another question but am still very keen to see Dan in an AB  jersey again. ,rugbyunion,cjk92pe,2,t5_2qkbe

It seems that Foleys assertion that there was no ruck formed is in fact accurateWrong. Firsly calling a ruck is purely a voluntary call by the ref and is not part of the rules system.

If the Red wingers foot is on the touch line as he receives then knocks the ball on then hes touch in goal  meter scrum. Even if he were to lift his foot before making contact with the ball then it would be a scrum advantage to blue for the knock which would then be lost when winger attempted to ground ball while in touch.

I know what the data says and they are right thats why I concede awhile ago that concussions are going to happen. What should be taken as solace is the fact that rugby out of all sports has taken the torch and led the way on concussion protocol as far as training coaches refs and personnel on what to do in the event someone has a concussion consistently working on making the game safer by tweaking the rules every year the biggest example being scrummages where a front row or lock could easily break his neck which Im sure we can both agree is a much worst injury and the fact that all around the world rugby is still touted as a game of brotherhood and camaraderie. Though with the game becoming professional it is slipping up a bit theres still a sense of honor within the game to not be a dick or expect to get taken care of by your team or the other. Not to mention the amount of trust and power is put into a refs hands during a match to control things from getting out of hand.My point is this yes concussions are a concern and should be continually researched so that we can find better prevention measure that will allow those of us that play and those of us that watch to continue to enjoy the game we love. But if there was ever a sport to put on blast and have moral apprehension towards concerning concussions rugby is certainly not that sport.,rugbyunion,cnpwyel,2,t5_2qkbe

I will say though that Rugby is an international game and different cultures can have a different idea of what constitutes nastiness.In terms of watching take the advice everyone else has about Super Rugby and  Nations.

2939912,0,t3_2tty3w,I personally do think its too early to take anything significant from the fact that only Leinster have qualified but it is obviously a worrying way to start this new competition for the Pro countries.Part of me does agree that in the past it was a slightly easier season for the top Irish players note not the teams but thats the way the IRFU and provinces have chosen to go with professionalism and its something that I think has benefitted both. However no one forced any other clubsnations to go a different route they chose it freely.But resting two or three top players for Europe isnt the same as being able to spunk money on having almost enough class players for two teams. Frances salary cap may as well be nonexistent whilst some of the English clubs also have massive financial clout and are able to buy big names instead of develop their own.So while the whole narrative of the ERCC may have been about making the competition fairer for French and English clubs in practice it has switched the advantage hugely in their favour and punished the Pro clubs for not being as rich. In the Heineken Cup French and English clubs could compete with Irish and other Pro clubs having some rested players by just buying better players. Now these clubs still have the ability to spend money on the best which the Pro clubs cant do and this may prove to be a massive disadvantage and make Europe a deadrubber barring the odd exceptionally good year.Ive said previously that in my opinion if this does prove to be the case then the Celtic nations may well just lose interest in Europe. It could actually be a good thing for the league were they to build on this disenchantment and make the league more competitive. That would obviously be something good but as a supporter of a club with such massive European pedigree I dont want to lose the thrill of playing against Europes best however I dont really know how the financial disparity will be combatted. ,rugbyunion,co2a48p,5,t5_2qkbe
2940185,0,t3_2tu2y3,It is certainly not illegal to tap a penalty and pass to a player in motion.Most professional teams go into contact with more caution in these situations with time running down because if they are taking the option they are most probably behind on the scoreboard and need a try. They dont want to lose possession because then they would lose the match. It is more likely to lose possession in a tackle if running into a brick wall at pace. They know the opposition is not going to allow them to score on the first phase. They may be trying to set up a maul. Even if they dont manage to set the maul they feel they are more likely to score through grinding out phase play with the forwards rather than through one all or nothing charge.,rugbyunion,co2b8e2,3,t5_2qkbe

The only definition that deals with a player in the air isgt If a player jumps and catches the ball both feet must land in the playing area otherwise the ball is in touch or touchingoal.which doesnt apply to your case. Depending on what was intended when it was written its either a statement of the blindingly obvious or its actually a useful clarification of is the ball in touch if they pass it away before they landed and who took the ball into touch in that case.The ARU has a booklet called Line Ball Your Call with their own interpretations in. Its far more complete than anything else Ive found.Based on page  their interpretation would be that you kept the ball in play as long as your body was above the field of play rather than above touch when you made contact with the ball.That said their interpretation on page  disagrees with my interpretation of the law I quoted above and with scenario G here In short the touch laws are fine up to the point where something interesting comes up and then theyre useless.,rugbyunion,cpfl9zf,5,t5_2qkbe

Id have met you face to face but I thought it would be more antagonistic if I did it by email and used a condescending tone.I know youve done well in the B amp I Cup over the last few seasons even reaching the final. I also know you value it because your club is capable of playing at higher standard than the Premiership and this provides its only opportunity. I know that your supporters take pleasure in it too supporting in their thousands. Tough luck. Were bigger than you and weve decided that our development team is much much more important than your little club. It simply isnt enough for us to play in Europe The Pro  and the AngloWelsh Cup. We want more.By the way well take some of your players too. If we select them do you think that your supporters will cheer for us next season? I do hope so. Afterall they have a duty to support us because we are your region. I know you believe me when I say that were are all in this together and Im proud to allow you to be part of the BluesFamily. Im not just saying that  I really really mean it. Honest.By the way dont bother complaining to the WRU. Our mate Gareth is in charge now and weve already met behind your back and made an agreement.In regional rugby together with the BluesFamilyDickCEO Blues FamilyP.S. I almost forgot! There could be room for a couple of new teams in the Pro  next season! I know youll find this news interesting and exciting! You know London Scottish who you beat twice this season in the BampI cup? Were going to invite them. Were also going to invite London Welsh. You know all about them because you beat them the year before when they were good. Thatll be good for Welsh rugby wont it?If it goes ahead perhaps youd like to join me at the Arms Park next year to watch one of the games against them. We can watch our boys in blue and black and chant together Cardiff! Cardiff! Cardiff!. Therell be top banter. I can tease you about people in the valleys living in caves and call you Reek.

Not just tackle them  but make a hit!Once everyone has gone through the drill do it again but big guys running full steam little guys come in from angle and make a hit.Practice by doing. You dont replicate match conditions in training there wont be the muscle memory in games. If you get smaller guys coming in and putting hits on big guys in training at full tilt it will build their confidence and help them to get to know the tackle and the technique ... if you devote an entire training session to tackling and making hits it will force them to experience it realise theyre fine and then it will be second nature in game hopefullyAlso before your next game and after training the tackle talk about it before the game  remind the players that youve worked hard on making hits and not missing tackles remind the players that in this game everyone is to put major focus on making their tackles whatever else happens in the game the number  target in this game is to miss as little tackles as possible.,rugbyunion,crza065,9,t5_2qkbe

This was far from the most egregious in the gamecoming as it did from lineout technicalities that are seldom policed although they probably will be in the future.From the great  analysis piece on the game we get this commentary on the first Springboks trygt Du Plessis never regains his feet as he competes and there is certainly some hint that he plays the ball illegally. Indeed the Kiwis seemed unhappy about it and scrumhalf Aaron Smith did shout Sir hes got to roll away! at referee Jrme Garcs. This is a pretty clear infringement of a kind that the ref should have noticed and was quite deliberate. Play went on a try was scored and that was that.

We dont have the numbers of the respective fans. France is a much bigger country than Ireland. I doubt its simply fan numbers.After all if venue size matters why is the match in the bigger venue much more expensive then? ,rugbyunion,ctr28kk,0,t5_2qkbe

5013305,0,t3_3jlbiz,Leinsters attack went from one of the best in Europe to one of the worst last year. We were readable by every team there was nothing inventive there was no imagination simply run pods up the middle. We struggled to break down mediocre defences at times. Leinster easily has the best academy in Europe its a conveyor belt of talent. Jono Gibbes and Leo Cullen in their respective years as Forwards Coach under Matt both developed an acceptable and expected amount of players in the pack in the backs Matts department our academy players suffered rarely got game time outside of injury necessity they were chastised by him publicly and several of them left to overseas clubs.Both the poor attack and lack of player development were warnings from Leicester Tigers fans when he was given the Leinster job I only wish we had listened to them. While not all of Leinsters problems were Matts fault I do sincerely mean it when I say fuck Matt OConnor. ,rugbyunion,cuqajo2,2,t5_2qkbe

5099168,0,t1_cuzcify,I will admit that the comment comes with bias being from Australia its been frustrating watching McCaw for years now get the better of our team  take every Bledisloe the past  years. Ive followed rugby my whole life so its not a judgement made off other opinions of McCaw its how I see him run the game. Sure technically hes sound like you said but hes so good at niggling with other teams which is where he gains ground. Im sorry but he does knowingly slow the ball down as best he can very subtly i might add. Most tackles he makes when under pressure as a teamin their own territory you can easily see his intentions. Slow the game down force a penalty which evidently is never called against king richie and just do his best provide slow ball for the other team. Another note is that his pilfering skill comes with blatant infringes of not releasing the tackler until way past the formation of the ruck. Im sure you may see things differently but from an Australian point of view its very annoying to watch him get away with. Again  this is a biased view like i said being a wallabies supporter.See thats the point of contention there Pocock is in his prime and he literally carries us on his back through matches. Take the rugby championship this year him being back from injury won us most breakdowns against the ABs something theyve havent conceded since he last played against them prior to  knee reconstructions. Richie is a leader and yeah is the focal point of NZ rugby. However Pocock as a player in my books is more sound.

It will help improve your physical safety if you have a strong core and generally be better able to compete physically legs are definitely important too obviously.  You wont have much opportunity to learn skills since I assume youll be training on your own unless you they have some sort of offseason touch or something but I assume if your school has a good rugby team the other players will be playing other sports during the fall and winter seasons.  Find a training regimen that you feel comfortable with and wont overstrain yourself that focuses on core strength explosiveness and endurance.  As another poster said watch a bunch of international rugby perfect right now since it seems many of the RWC matches are being posted as replays on youtube and theres a lot of analysis flying around learn the rules and learn as much as you can.Also best of luck to you man!  I remember being  years old in America and joining rugby for the first time.  Its been nearly  decades since and Im still playing the sport.  I keep trying to retire and I keep on coming back because theres just no other sport like it.  Ive lived in  different countries found a club in every single one and made great friends because of it.  As a teammate in my last city said joining a club is just an easy way to have  instant friends any time you move to a new city.  Its a game that can take you all the way into your s and s playing in old boys social matches and having a laugh and theres a real sense of a global community.  I remember the first  weeks in freshman year of high school I nearly quit because everything hurt but your body gets used to it and gets hard and you learn getting hit in the face is not nearly as bad as it seems at first and the game has repaid me in countless unexpected ways for sticking with it. ,rugbyunion,cv9tmy4,2,t5_2qkbe

I dont think Ford was axed as the Telegraph suggests but rather an aim to exploit the two different play styles of the fly halves.First half is the Saracens approach  This midfield is big and defensive so the back  will not be getting that much ball for at least the first half. My guess is that bomber wants to keep the game tight and dull to exhaust or frustrate the welsh backs. Try and win some penalties and Farrell as the better kicker to keep the scoreboard ticking.Then at  minutes bring on fresh legs of Ford and maybe Slade to open up the wingers.

But in this case with the extra injuries it now feels like out of the two teams I support the one with a better chance of winning the tournament has caused themselves problems by imploding to a team who now has quite a bit less chance of winning the tournament.Still hoping both will go through and hopefully Wales can regroup and not let the weakened squad affect them too much. As for England they tend to only start playing well once they are up against it so this could be the catalyst  this is not as bad a defeat as the hammering South Africa gave and England just got better as a result of that.,rugbyunion,cvfqbtl,1,t5_2qkbe

Im also not convinced Farrell would have kicked it and even though there was a minute left I dont think theyd have got it back.Kicking for touch was exactly what Japan did the other day and everyone was praising them. Sure the context of the group is slightly different but I think its just one of those situations where youre going to be evaluated with hindsight based on the result not based on the choice itself.I also think its disgusting that Lancaster hasnt immediately stood by Robshaw his captain.

5284368,0,t1_cvn43dt,I went to one of the GPS schools. In terms of popularity youre right. Of the winter sports its the th most popular behind AFL League and soccer however like all sports in Aus it is taken quite seriously. For example Rugby in the GPS schools is highly competitive. Because of this competitiveness due to these schools being very prestigious training programs etc are constantly being improved. Last year one of these schools actually employed a st XV coach that was his entire job didnt even teach P.E or anything like that. Super  teams then usually incorporate exceptional talent into their wider training squads while the rest either go on to play for local clubs or universities. In fact most professional Australian rugby players actually attended a GPS schools. However I personally think the National Rugby Championship needs to become popular if we want to improve as it adds further competition but in saying that union is still not popular enough with the majority of people.   ,rugbyunion,cvn511l,11,t5_2qkbe

5363890,0,t1_cvx5ouy,In Rugby the governing body can deem that a player deserved a greater sanction than the one they received. This happened a lot when World Rugby were trying to stamp out tip tackling. Players would get yellow carded for tackles which World Rugby or the different unions would then upgrade to a ban because they deemed it was worthy of a red card.This is very different to football where if the referee saw a tackle and deals with it on the pitch there cannot be any retroactive punishment in England at least.,rugbyunion,cvxaq35,1,t5_2qkbe
5363992,0,t1_cvwukig,Thats what happens when you get so far ahead almost noone can give you points any more. Australia have capitalised on getting to earn double points from two games maybe three I cant remember what the standings were for the Fiji game but I doubt it was within ten points while New Zealand havent had any chance at points in this WC. Didnt do England much good of course as you still need to win the games. Australia are actually in the same boat as New Zealand now only beating another team in the top  can gain them points.

5368864,0,t3_3ok47s,Yes. I even think Naholo being injured forced his inclusion. I think I figured out the AB coaches logic here hear me out.Naholo is Saveas one for one backup. Piutau is Ben Smiths  and Milner  Skudders back up.Piutau has been in the All Blacks set up for about  years now and could slot straight back in if need be. He knows the moves he knows the other players he knows the coaches and has experienced cauldron like atmospheres before. An injury to NMS in the final pool game? No big deal call up Piutau and hell be right for the quarter final. Naholo has only been in camp since the start of this year and was only able to play in one test. If we left Naholo at home and Savea got injured then wed be left with a player whos only recently coming back from injury with no game time since his injury and very little All Blacks experience. Hed be a massive liability. By selecting him and getting him involved with the team ie. training group sessions analysis etc etc etc. He is in a far better position if the worst was to happen to Savea now than if hed stayed at home doing rehab on his own.Also as far as the ABs are concerned Pituau isnt a guaranteed starter. If he was then hed be over there ahead of MilnerSkudder.In my eyes it is a very well calculated risk. If Savea was to get injured then we would all agree it was a risk worth taking.,rugbyunion,cvxxkw6,41,t5_2qkbe

If an  or  picks up and goes you have more distance to cover and theyve got a jump on you. Watch closely for the pickup and be ready to run hard sideways. If the scrum is breaking up just go  chances are someone is going to pick it up or the whistle is going to blow. However if you disengage too early and the scrum is still going youve made a mistake. You have to quickly back up five metres or to the goal line. If you make the tackle while moving backwards you may get called offside.

Last night the Scots had prepared to harass the ruck and McCalman is just not the same class as Pocock in that area. This seems like the jittering ramblings of a Kiwi. the real issue is that Toomua Beale and McCalman werent injected in to the game at around  mins we had fucking Quade and Mcmahona good player but useless in the circumstance.You can beat a hapless French outfit with a full strength team?

5453670,0,t1_cw8pkao,Heres the thing though foreign coaches for the US havent bought the results. American coaches have. Ive been following the Eagles since  and Ive seen four foreign coaches since then and they were all flawed. Its not that foreign coaches intrinsically cant coach the US national team its that the guys we can afford on our budget ie not Graham Henry or Vern Cotter arent really that great and many have struggled with the unique demands of American rugby. Half the squad are amateurs so you cant just get them together for a training sesh. Half are  miles away on a different coast. Some are university students. No other country really faces that  Canada for example has most of its rugby talent located in and around Vancouver so you can get  of the team together on a Saturday no problem. The rugby epicentre of America is the Bay Area and you might have five Eagles from there. Our club game is fractured which is USA Rugbys fault and coaches either deal with that or look to import Americanqualified players from overseas with mixed results. If you look at what Tolkin actually did it compares favourably to what his predecessors did. Tolkin went  which doesnt sound great but he played a far tougher schedule than his predecessors.Look at his wins vs. Peter Thorburn who coached from  Scott Johnson  and Eddie OSullivan . Thorburn beat Barbados Uruguay away and home.Johnson beat Uruguay at home. Thats it.Eddie beat Georgia at home Canada at home Uruguay away and home Russia at home Portugal away Russia in England and Russia in NZ.Tolkin beat Georgia at home Russia in Wales Romania in Bucharest ! Georgia away Russia in England by  Uruguay at home Canada at home Romania at Bucharest Japan at home and then Canada twice in a two Test series. Id argue thats a more impressive collection of wins in three years than the previous five years against more professional opponents. It doesnt totally let him off the hook for a poor RWC and Clevergate but it illustrates my point here. Tolkins got a more impressive collection of results than any US coach ever except for Jack Clark who is also an American. Like I said its not Graham Henry vs. Donald Trump for USA rugby coach. Its flawed foreign guy who probably cant crack it in his own country vs. American guy who probably understands the challenges of American rugby better. I am utterly unconvinced that there is an attainable foreign coach who would have improved on the  result although they might have kept Todd Clever in the team. ,rugbyunion,cw8rbaf,2,t5_2qkbe

Getting an attacking maul right requires tight discipline and hours of training  those who deride the maul are usually fans of teams who are crap at them Pucollidge has pretty much nailed the list of ways to stop one. The main reasons youll see defending teams penalised are if they drop a maul to the ground deliberately chopping legs of the attackers or dragging them to the floor joining a maul from the side much like a ruck or breaking their bind with a player to try and swim through the maul.While some attacking mauls may look unstoppable usually its actually just a case of the defending team completely messing up their counterdrive.,rugbyunion,cwfvfsm,6,t5_2qkbe

The whole situation puts a stain on the national game and if the man at the top Ian Ritchie is the one calling the shots in the meeting on the RFUs future how can one hold his position to the candle.The real question is who evaluates the current structure and Ian Ritchies position? Who makes him accountable? In an essence its what Sir Clive Woodward pointed out recently the man at the top of the tree should be jointly held responsible not chairing the bloody meetings!Im not suggesting that Woodward is right about everything he says but in this instance common sense had to prevail in the decision making progress. It clearly hasnt.Currently there is still a vast amount of snobbery and were better than you attitudes that still exist within the hierarchy that transcend their way down the ladder but clearly this attitude doesnt alter the performances the pitch. Sadly its these performances that have cost the coach his job when the real change I would like to see is a different approach to the attitudes within.Ian Ritchie should be held responsible for how the RFU as a company operates and shows itself. It is time they realised there is a difference between national pride and international arrogance. Wake up smell the coffee and be prepared to get your own hands dirty instead of just directing others to do the job for you.TLDR  Ian Ritchie the man behind the desk shouldnt be the boss he should be a leader.

6533624,0,t3_454ep4,Feeling pretty good about this game. Not writing the Scots off at all as they proved in the WC how effective they can be but I was impressed with Wales last week. It would have been very easy for Ireland to walk all over us being at home in the opening week and playing how they did but we held our own and dug deep when we needed to. Roberts was like a rock in defence commanding his line masterfully and JD brought a bit of spark back into the defence. The back row all performed well and even the new boys in the front row held their own. I feel like a draw was a fair result but it sets us up well to build on it for the rest of the tournament. I agree with most of the points in that article though. We need to ship it wide more and let North stretch his legs and Russell definitely seemed like an area to exploit. Im not convinced about targeting Hogg  he seemed like one of the best players on the pitch last week but if hes overworked it may free up some space as they say.Ill be at the game very excited.

6669075,0,t3_4706bn,Are you going to be a forward or a back? Really that only matters for set pieces but make sure someone fills you in.As you say in open play you want to avoid contact so youll move the ball with big passes to space the pitch stretch your opponents and look for spaces. Test their reaction to your steps and look for pace mismatches once youve stretched them to one side without overcommiting ie being close enough to be tackled pull out pass behind you and work back the other way until you can exploit someone one on one and get on their outside for a break. You want to keep the ball alive as much as possibleQuick rucking is very key but if you are turned over get organised with your D very quickly. You work as a team with a soft drift covering the pitch again not overcommiting. If you score a try youll probably have to take the conversion i think you only get  seconds and it must be a drop kick. Its only  minutes each way but is a real lungbuster so you should be rotated with subs. It seems intimidating at first but its not its just a bit of fun. Talk with your team mates and theyll get you through it.,rugbyunion,d0951gx,2,t5_2qkbe

6754071,1,t1_d0hwspy,gt I do agree that the N is in desperate need of an incentive for more attacking rugby but we should look into more creative solutions although I dont have any to offer. In my opinion though the real incentive would be that teams need to get their shit together in order to stop being humiliated against southern teams. The WC was a disaster for NH teams partly because their attacking game hasnt evolved at all for the past decade.Very well said. The N isnt a bit turgid because it lacks bonus points its a bit turgid because NH rugby as a whole is a bit turgid. So much of NH rugby is boshball between two sets of gym bunnies yes Super Rugby and the RC have bonus points but so does the Heineken Cup. The difference is SH teams even the South Africans treasure ball skills and initiative while NH teams find it a distraction or something to be discouraged because your chance of knocking on might be  higher. Id say its almost systematic although fully half the championship are led by riskaverse Kiwis.I think part of the problem has generally been poor leadership. Wales are fully in the throes of Gatlandball Schmidtball is also defensefirst and England and France have spent the better part of a decade now staring at their navels. Im generally a Wales fan but theres something to be said for wishing that Eddie Jones sorts England out because England is capable of playing some nice rugby and that would force the other countries to pick up their game a bit. Sadly Ive all but lost hope for France I just cant see them figuring stuff out. ,rugbyunion,d0hxesc,0,t5_2qkbe

6890850,0,t1_d0xdxbs,Well said. Weve had a great set of players for years now and they play in a warrenball straightjacket. Its good enough to win fairly often but tends to come up short against top quality teams.We often forget that Garlands first year in charge gave us a grand slam by combining Edwards defense with the free flowing offloading attacking play wed had before that. As well as we do sometimes we hit a ceiling a few years ago and have not progressed at all. Id love to ask Garland how he sees Wales progressing in the coming years.

6918225,0,t3_4ahy1b,Pretty much as expected really though I didnt see Lydiate as being secondchoice for the captaincy. Perhaps the extra responsibility will result in him raising his game. Im a bit disappointed that Owens isnt the starting hooker. I rate Ken more highly than Baldwin generally but the Ospreys man deservedly held the shirt for a while. But hes completely out of form at the moment. Id have liked to see Priestland get a start too both to keep him ticking over and to give Biggar a deserved rest. Good to see Amos and Tipuric in the starting XV and Im looking forward to seeing what Moriarty can do when he comes on. Itll be interesting to see what his role will be actually. Will he replace captainfortheday Lydiate or Faletau? The latter would be the obvious answer but Faletau is almost never subbed off.I wouldve liked to see a centre on the bench too. Tyler Morgan and Scott Williams are injured and we wont get many better opportunities to look at other players. Owen Watkin might have been a good shout. Mightve been interesting to look at Ashton Hewitt too wing not centre of course.My big hope for this game is that we throw off the shackles and play attacking headsup rugby from the off. ,rugbyunion,d10i5iy,4,t5_2qkbe

If anything I would argue that there are not enough teams within certain states. There are Waratah squad members that cant get game time but are of a higher standard than the Force. Changing state to play rugby is a big ask and not an easy life decision.,rugbyunion,d1lb88q,2,t5_2qkbe

7114695,0,t1_d1muim5,Yeah I think its just one of those areas that World Rugby need to clean up the interpretation of laws. It just makes it confusing imo and adds unnecessary complexity.I checked the laws to double check and it saysgtAll players of the opposing team must retire to their goal line and must not overstep that line until the kicker begins the approach to kick or starts to kick. When the kicker does this they may charge or jump to prevent a goal but must not be physically supported by other players in these actions.I personally think the step back is beginning the approach and think its pedantic if we define beginning the approach as a players forward movement towards the ball.,rugbyunion,d1mul0c,2,t5_2qkbe

And yellow cards for tackles off the ball is ridiculous sure for some but there are occasions when it isnt needed.  substitutions? maybe but without actual research into injuries caused by subs that is just guessing. You talk about getting rid of accidental offside but also banning blocking runners when these are two incidents that are very similar. I believe blocking is banned anyway so I dont get your point.Competing for the ball at scrum time is still a concept it just becomes very hard at that level. You see it alot more lower down.I dont see how one lifter will improve anything. Penalties for collapsed scrums are a must especially near the try line as teams could just collapse scrums over and over with no punishment. All in all seems that you havent really thought about this or just dont watch a lot of rugby.,rugbyunion,d2mehz3,2,t5_2qkbe

7469172,0,t1_d2r693j,If its out of a lineout mauls are an expected outcome.  As soon as you connect with the offensive players you have created a maul.  I guess if you are able to take him down immediately you might be ok.  But if two others lifters are still holding onto him Id imagine the defender wouldnt make a clean quick tackle.  That time between the contact and the tackle has created a maul.  Technically any time the ball carrier one offense and one defense are joined up its a maul.  In a bang bang situation no it wont ever get called and shouldnt really.  If the tackler is able to take the ball carrier to the ground quickly then its just a tackle.  But when another player is able to join up and hold up the ballcarrier it becomes a maul.The bottom line is its kind of a judgment call.  I mean coming into contact in twos could be prebinding or a flying wedge type violation or a dangerous play. Its really just my opinion... but if I was reffing and a team took a lineout and as the jumper came to the ground and is bound by his lifters a defender attacks his legs then takes a second or two to finally get him to the ground during which time other defenders would likely be joining the maul Id call it collapsing the maul.  Your scenario assumes all other defenders just stand there and wait and that the offensive lifters and potentially a third guy coming from behind arent able to hold up the ballcarrier.  If no other defenders join AND the lifters arent able to hold the ball carrier up then sure its probably just a tackle as only the ballcarrier and the tackler end up on the ground.  I just dont think that will happen very often.   As soon as the tackle doesnt go to ground immediately or other defenders join it will become a maul.   ,rugbyunion,d2r76km,1,t5_2qkbe

7721864,0,t1_d3jooq2,Actually no Id say its exactly that kind of attitude that makes Wales A country with very little resources players and comparatively money the international team it is standing up for the players on the team alongside you not giving in to bullies. Im a huge fan of Sam Davies and have loads of time for Patchell Dirksen Eli etc. I didnt say anything about them or even that I wouldnt pick them over Priestland or Cuthbert. I totally agree Cuthbert needs some time away from the XV to refind himself Ideally I would have liked to see him take a yearlong sabbatical a la Corbisero. A lot of the talk surrounding his defence is a myth too. His positioning was somewhat dodgy that first campaign in the side but he worked hard on it Likewise his handling and passing and became very adept. Id point to the South Africa tour two years ago The last time we saw Cuthbert on any kind of form We conceded  tries either down Norths wing or as a result of him missing a tackle and only one down Cuthberts. Yet guess who fans laid the blame on? I just really feel for the guy. Hes nowhere near as bad in any respect as people say he is.

8096710,0,t3_4q28yq,While the player base and skills are great noone has mentioned the All Blacks coaching environment.  In times past when the All Blacks winning wasnt a given there was a much more volatile culture in the team and in the Coaching staff. Remember how John Hart and John Mitchells time as coach ended? The current coaching group is really an extension of the work put in by Graham Henry and its continuing to create a team that performs at the highest level in all facets of play. But if this culture were eroded if the coaches changed and it didnt work as well and especially if NZ lost faith in the team then things could quickly change.  All the player talent in the world can only go so far if the team dynamics arent right and players start to second guess themselves.,rugbyunion,d4q55qk,6,t5_2qkbe

While the black middle class is now larger than the white middle class in this country many many black people dont have a proteinrich diet as a result of their economic class. This means theyre often smaller than white people and more prone to injury etc. Secondly SA rugby is very much dominated by a few private read crazy expensive schools. again because of the economic disparities these schools are disproportionately white  thus leading to a larger white player base at the top level of our schools system.As SuperCrossPrawn also mentioned white kids parents played rugby and their grandparents and its on TV at home etc. Most black peoples parents didnt play rugby and so arent that into it. One more thing is many black houses cant afford the full DSTV package to get Supersport  to watch rugby.

Despite the bum picture not being extremely offensive we do not want to promote a misogynistic atmosphere not everyone recognises that some people have a misogynistic outlook and what we dont want to do is encourage that if we want a higher female population to this sub which I argue we do want.

It would mean stretching the opposition out and creating holes if he plays on the line opening up space for kerevi or Folau who are good runners with space. DHP is good under high ball but he has huge liabilities on the wing in defence. Kurindrani is very good at tracking the play and shutting down breaks. He could be as big as nadolo one day if he wanted. I put kerevi on the inside as he really is one of the best tight meter runners around but has the ball skills of a lesbian prison officer. He can get that with time. Or even Kerevi at  with ball skills developed with Hodge at  as outside playmaker think BOD would be a great and very long term centre pairing.Also kurindrani could also own the  channel for the next  years if he wanted to. ,rugbyunion,d7hyxs9,1,t5_2qkbe

As of now?  Hes not in his name is down the list and its a hard list to jump spots in.    The top st s in NZ dont look like theyre going away anytime soon.  Sure If he keeps improving he might get a chance but he needs to do it in  or  because they wont pick a bolter at st  in  if theyve got  test guys available.

9729912,0,t1_dab436n,Jesus christ where to start.Firstly were not equally funded each club is funded the same from the IRFU. If Leinster are able to market and develop their brand at home and abroad better then why should they have to share that with Connacht? I dont see Connacht helping fund Leinsters academy amp underage structures off which we developed a squad that allowed us compete in europe over the past decade a structure which produces more players for the islands teams as a whole then any other academy fyi. How many of Leinsters centrally contracted players are Leinster born and bred? Probably all I would guess. Develop players who actually want to stay down there put funding in place to keep them there like Leinster has done with DOB funding Sexton and Heaslip and then you can crib when a player leaves until then its just part of being a little fish fighting upstream. Leinster year on year turn a profit something Connacht have never done theyre being held up by the IRFU right now. When the club is in a position to actually keep their own players then you can act like a spoilt brat until then cop the f on. And I dont quite think you understand what a central contract implies. Players are centrally contracted not to help the province but to help team Ireland. We lose half our squad for a large chunk of every season and are heavily restricted in when we can play them when we have them and are even forced to play them in games where they may clearly be the weaker option because of a poor run of form. So its a tradeoff. You get a players wage paid in lieu of losing control over that player.JGP doesnt have the same status one is an NIQ player one is a project player. Very different things very clear rules around each. And you could argue that Pienaar has been a hindrance to Ulster long term because hes held back any potential scrumhalves that may have come through up there by taking the chunk of the playing time. As for Henshaw he had offers on the table from all irish provinces and Nucifora did want him to stay out west. But his missus his childhood sweetheard is in college in UCD and he wanted to be in Dublin because thats where she is going to be. If you honestly think that the IRFU are either powerful enough or brazen enough as to be able to breach EU freedom of movement laws around work then you are even more deluded then you come off. Connacht have done marvellously over the past  years to turn around what was an absolute shit show for the previous decade. Instead of crying about how little you have look to develop what you have and in time who knows maybe youll be able to keep your players and become a European powerhouse and not a one season wonder.,rugbyunion,dacfa9c,1,t5_2qkbe

Add to that the possibility of injury to players and there is a very good argument to review and clarify the enforcement of the law.I tend to the side of strictly enforcing the law. The goal is to prevent possible injury. Theres tons of situations where a tackle goes high. Most of the time its accidental but that doesnt mean its not still risky to player safety.

10532898,0,t1_dd1h6qd,It gets messy as you look at grandparents and parents each individual probably would need a small paragraph explaining their eligibility. For instance Luke Mcleans grandparents had to give up Italian citizenship to buy land in Australia but because their children remained Italian Luke Mclean was qualified. Theres also the likes of players born abroad through parents postings or work Vunipolas dad played professionally in Wales Heaslips dad was in the UN and was stationed in Israel which is hard to suss out. The us dont count as most International sides second senior side so they dont tie down eligibility that way. Since A side matches are becoming rarer and rarer they dont tie down many players. That leaves s. But because the s circuit is becoming so specialised that there arent many players capable of transitioning over to the  aside game. Nakatici Vakatawa I believe is the only one who came this way through a very circuitous route. He played us for Fjii but because Fijis  side is their designated second side he wasnt tied to them. He then joined an academy in France and earned residency that way before joining their s and being called up to the full test side. ,rugbyunion,dd20qp6,1,t5_2qkbe

Isnt the point that this is exactly what happened. Ireland are currently the form side of those three and Wales scarcely deserve to be mentioned in the same breath on current form and they played not just at their normal level but actually pretty damn well and we won anyway.gt Someone needs to put the brakes on the hype train its getting out of control.Why?

But with the ambition and commercial management skills theres potential for a massive competition in the Pro in terms of market and broad appeal. It could well be the key to not only keeping pace with but surpassing English and French competition only. Very very difficult to achieve but I believe a spectacular competition could be made if the ambition and competency exists within the organization.,rugbyunion,de0f6f1,1,t5_2qkbe
10870353,0,t1_de1155x,st try is Ioanes carry getting their defence moving backwards Mike Philips clearing out Youngs and James blocking Mullan. Denny then swoops in to run through the gap created. This isnt vision and its not exactly a defensive error. Its a set move.nd try is not easy to pull off. Youre correct in that it probably wouldnt have worked had Wade not slipped but the pitch had already caused a few players to slip that game and if youre going to get the chip on anyone its probably Wade. I also think he didnt intend that kick to go so far in field. Overall luck involved but such is sport.rd try is fairly straight forward.The great thing about this hattrick is it was scored in  mins i think by the team in th pos against the top team in the Prem  imo.Also Denny is no unknown he holds the record as the top Super League try scorer by season. He has clearly continued that form superbly into Union and showed this is no lucky streak.Lions chat is way too soon. He hasnt been challenged enough yet.

11055055,0,t3_5xuoa1,You will be a lot less tired from scrimmaging. So you need to increase your work rate around the park. Both in carrying and hitting rucks. Not just passively hitting rucks either I am taking first or second man. If you arent comfortable in the air. Get a couple mates to lift you and throw a couple balls are you before putting you back down. Spend as much time in the air as possible. If possible lose a bit of weight to make it easier. When you are carrying around the ruck attempt to shift the ball with short little pops. Try move the defence. It is tempting but as a former prop turned second row. It is better to try just move the centre of attack ever so slightly. Also when defending as a prop you would be more used to defending at pillar of the ruck. Try move away from the ruck a bit more. Let the props take the area next to the ruck. Apart from this. Best of luck,rugbyunion,del2liz,10,t5_2qkbe

The defending team do not have the ball they are not required to do anything it is the team with the ball that has to do something with the ball! Oh and your suggestion would just see the defending team pinged for offside or grabbed by the attacking team and pulled into the mall.

Their version of touch rugby rippa rugby emphasizes skills over powersize. For decades the backhanded compliment Tier  countries have given the Eagles is that they tackle hard. I dont think contact skills are the source of Americas rugby performance deficit. Ability to pass off both hands and defend space in groups are more likely candidates.Creating a noncontact familiarity with the game at a young age also can create more rugby fans.

When Wilko BOD POC Dallaglio talk people stop and listen. People want to be associated with value. People want to sponsor SBW or Burgess for that reason.
