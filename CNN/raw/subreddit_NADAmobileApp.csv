6802999,0,t1_d0napg1,But its just not fair to those that cant be checking all day.. no one should have to constantly check anyway. Every other place lets you cash out and then puts you on a list. And then the gift cards are processed in the order they are received. Making us guess when there might be gift cards and having to refresh the redemption page just isnt a good way to run things,NADAmobileApp,d0nevxw,4,t5_39p5k

8236715,0,t3_4rysff,Shame on you!  you are supposed to be focused on NADA and watching the videoads when doing it... Nada is the most important thing. ,NADAmobileApp,d57584x,2,t5_39p5k
9131027,0,t1_d88h28l, Flash is enabled and ad blocking is turned off for NADA sites. Even tried completely disabling adblock across all sites and nothing. Though now that you mention it Swagbucks has started complaining again about an adblocker being used on the SBs homepage its not enabled there either we do see ads. Maybe a recent update somewhere broke something. Ill have to try completely removing the adblock plugin to see if that makes a difference anywhere. We use two different computersmobile devices. Until about a month ago Id have to check to be sure though we keep track of daily points earned everything was groovy. Thinking back that may be about when SBs started complaining too even though no manual changes had been made here... Funny thing is we noticed that sometimes watching ads on the mobile device will trigger ads to work on desktop again. Could be just coincidence of course. ,NADAmobileApp,d89f91o,1,t5_39p5k

10999161,0,t3_5wr8bh,You could always use good ol pen and paper to keep track. I wish other apps would have caps on them. That way we might be able to make money. If you guys dont like it find something else.  Not sure where else you could go that guaranteed you . a day right now though. ,NADAmobileApp,deepzt8,2,t5_39p5k
