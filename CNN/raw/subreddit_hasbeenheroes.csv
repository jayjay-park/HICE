11383581,0,t3_629kst,Glad to see it isnt just me that noticed this. I would love to play this game docked but am having a great time with it out of the dock as it is.,hasbeenheroes,dfmb5ms,1,t5_3bqdv
11385548,0,t1_dfmbchz,I got elemtnal vendor awhile ago. And non elemental vendor. I failed a lot until then.lol,hasbeenheroes,dfmj6jy,1,t5_3bqdv
11415536,0,t3_62y51i,Thats a... good damn question.  In my experience it mainly seems to be about synergizing with other elements.Wind on a soak target freezes.Lightning on a soaked target does more damage.I feel like Ice might do more damage or make freeze last longer?  No clue on that one honestly.Fire Im unsure about.I believe it prevents poison.As for soak as a status by itself I really dont know.,hasbeenheroes,dfpxu5b,3,t5_3bqdv
11431750,0,t3_6373yi,Gotta interrupt boss spells is the best I can describe it.  There are some skele mages and ghost bosses that are literally impossible if you dont have spellsmelee to stop their casts.Also pay attention to how many attacks the enemies have.  Sure the Luchador can withstand some stamina hits but some enemies have  attacks and can chew right through him if youre not careful.,hasbeenheroes,dfrrzf8,3,t5_3bqdv

11504253,0,t1_dfzvnmt,I dont see it as lazyif you look at BoI lots of enemy look alikecrapton of item with the same effect and almost every character are the same item and some minor tweek to stat and yet Isaac is one of my favorite game.Anyway like you said its hard to enjoy a game when you feel burned out.Editim at  win and  hours played ,hasbeenheroes,dg00a35,2,t5_3bqdv
11546398,0,t1_dg4ntoa,Im sad to say I FINALLY had my first loss to the Jailwarden today and the only reason why? The game gave me no water magic to utilize manually with fire for Steam. I had a metric ton of Ice magic though which was outstanding... Until as one person on calls him on our Discord Fuckface McEndyourrun showed up.,hasbeenheroes,dg4sbsm,1,t5_3bqdv
11555214,0,t1_dg561h2,If I remember correctly you dont have to wait the whole animation but the  icon has to appear. Although its best to wait through the whole thing just in case. DPlease let us know if this does not help and youre candles are still going missing.Ella from Frozenbyte,hasbeenheroes,dg5scsr,2,t5_3bqdv
11562012,0,t3_650595,I absolutely hate Herald of Gales.  This boss will teleport to you through the lane. Not only that he has TONS of  stamina minions with him. This boss feels heavily dependant on spells. To beat this boss you need a SHIT ton of AOE spells or a bunch of stamina breaking spells. Ive lost to this boss more than anything else and by a big margin too. It feels really unfun cheap design of a boss.  When he does get to you he does a shit ton of slashes so even if you managed to rack up  stamina in one go hell shred it all with one gap closer which he has and its a fucking teleport. You cant cancel his casting animation with auto attacks either because of his plentiful high stamina minions so this leaves you with the option of throwing spells at him. Youre wasting spells cancelling his animations rather than dealing with the minions as well. The fight feels over before it starts if you dont have the right spells.  I hope frozenbyte nerfs him or changes the way his play style is.,hasbeenheroes,dg6k4gp,2,t5_3bqdv
11570664,0,t1_dg71r95,I figured it out last night on the switch if you click in the left joy stick it lets you look through items instead of spells,hasbeenheroes,dg7jgws,1,t5_3bqdv
11593702,0,t1_dga2x00,gt The first few wins can almost certainly all be completed without any luck at all in items and spells.I feel that its more so the RNG of enemy placement that kills me more than item or spell RNG. Sometimes lanes can fill faster than I can possibly clear them with my characters attack recharge time and I frequently get enemies with four stamina blocks which again is hard to deal with given attack recharge speed and spell cooldowns.gt its more that Necrodancer gave you an incorrect expectation out of roguelikes.I suppose youre right about that but I still stand by my opinion that theres a fine line between challenging and just plain unfairness and I think HasBeen Heroes crosses that line more than it should even if its a trait of the genre.,hasbeenheroes,dga5kj6,1,t5_3bqdv
11653866,0,t3_65h0sx,This game is amazing! I love BoI too though so wont be selling that D,hasbeenheroes,dggzapy,2,t5_3bqdv
11666748,0,t1_dghdez6,You unlock the thing but the thing is still mysterious until you buy it  find it in a chest after youve unlocked it. Once youve picked it up  bought it once it will always tell you what it is and will always look the same.,hasbeenheroes,dgifw3x,3,t5_3bqdv
11670083,0,t1_dgit3e5,Was actually the team synergy vid for the monk I struggle to see where he is useable compared to the other  hitters but the vid on the three skeleton brothers helped out the strategy I used a lot.,hasbeenheroes,dgitior,1,t5_3bqdv
11686002,0,t1_dgkl8rn,I saw a youtube post about using sultan w metacles being good so I think Im going to try that out. Actually surprised me to hear that.Now that the game has gotten longer in the th run it makes sense that Metacles is better suited for the longer runs. on the nd and rd I would have not recommended using him because of no dmg spell and non existent attack power. But he does have  spell damage. That seems pretty damn good when your at the end of the game and have filled out spell slots. I am trying it out but so far my favorite combo has been luchadortiger luchadorbard is a close second. I love that the luchador has a extended lightning arc on his second slot. I also feel as tho the lightning spells I have gotten tend to be more powerful and useful than other elements.I think Im giving up on the dwarf giving the sultan a nd chance apparently if you utilize his backstab ability and combo it w Metacles freeze it can be good and trying to rediscover metacles now that Im on the th run. Bard is still on my list of consideration somewhere if I were to use him it would be only w the luchador tho.luchador yayDwarf nay EDIT I may have to give this another trywarrior mehsultan giving him on more chance but my gut feeling says he sucks and depending on a backstab is a hard thing to dotiger yayMetacles working on my opinion lots of people like himbard I like w luchador but I feel there has to be a better combo out there I think now that Im a big boy I should maybe switch to metaclesThats what Im thinking but I have only had a limited amount of runs with most combos,hasbeenheroes,dgkmjh3,2,t5_3bqdv
11709844,0,t1_dgnbei2,Absolutely but you have to prioritize. If you have  gold and youre on a common vendor but the next place on your path is a spell vendor you should prioritize that spell over the item most likely.Of course everything is circumstantial but in general a spell will be more impactful on your run than an item.,hasbeenheroes,dgnc9o5,1,t5_3bqdv
