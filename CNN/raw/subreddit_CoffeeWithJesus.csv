3516262,0,t1_cpsyoiq,Im an Atheist but lets have some fun. Jesus the son of God would theoretically have access to basically all the higher dimensions right? Being spiritual omniscient beings would allow them to perceive time in its entirety. We perceive time presently but we have no access to the past and no access to the future. Jesus theoretically might have access to the past present and future. But for him the future is literally every possibility. Jesus might know what youre going to say by virtue of simply perceiving every possible future for you.  ,CoffeeWithJesus,cpt2vto,5,t5_2t2l5
