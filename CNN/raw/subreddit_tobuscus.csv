7213940,0,t1_d1y5dbc,gt  he was why? Because hes lonely obviously. Like I said above when he feels unwanted someones gonna come kiss his ass. Toby dug himself I partly agree but the ripping off pants bit is something I dont agree with.Also just because you understand someones choices doesnt make them right which Im sure you know Im just clarifying.,tobuscus,d1y63i9,3,t5_2sjca

7227999,0,t1_d1y701n,gtThis stuff is horrible and as much as I hope its not true it doesnt look great. I find it hard to believe that all of these people are conspiring to ruin his reputation. Its certainly possible but its also quite possible that shes telling the truth and getting called a liar and a bitch and worse.You seem to be combining issues here. The rape allegation is separate from the other stuff. People seem to agree that he has emotional problems drug issues and cheats on girlfriends. Most of the people that Ive seen arent saying they were raped by him or that they saw him rape somebody else. There is a huge difference between the that and the parts of the story they are corroborating and I think its important to make that distinction clear. Doing drugs cheating or having your own emotional problems cause issues with the people you are dating does not in any way shape or form exist as proof for rape nor should it make you more likely to believe someone committed rape. The only thing that should in my opinion is a sexual assault evidence collection kit a video of the incident or some other form of physical evidence. I get its a tough situation because on the one hand coming forward if you have been raped could prevent the same thing from happening to someone else because they might be more cautious around that person. On the flip side if they didnt do it they could still have their lives ruined by a false claim. Everything they have worked for or achieved could be taken away just based off of someones word and that just doesnt seem right either.Thats why Im of the opinion that its always best to side with the person being accused unless there is solid proof. Im in the camp that would rather see someone guilty not get caught than an innocent mans life shattered and potentially end up in jail for something he didnt do. And eyewitness testimony just isnt enough. Too many psychology studies have shown how flawed it is and way too many people have been convicted of things like murder on such evidence only to find that after years in jail they finally got their request for a DNA test granted and it cleared their names. You cant use what is statistically most likely to convict someone nor should it be used to assume guilt and trash someones life. ,tobuscus,d1zrpnh,2,t5_2sjca
7246871,0,t1_d21wq62,I completely agree with you that he should definitely take a hiatus and figured himself out. Drug addiction ADHD and the stresses of fame are a bad mix. Consequences must be paid for over what ever has been done or has happened of course but its true in that right now his wellbeing must be focused on. Looking back at his vlogs now you can sense that there is a hidden pain and struggle needing to be looked at.,tobuscus,d21x1pb,3,t5_2sjca

7277135,0,t1_d25bzrv,Youre right he does so. There is a lot going on there and hes neglecting it by blanketing it all with carnal pleasures and temporary highs.It is a shame indeed but maybe this is what he needs right now otherwise it would just continue to get worse  if it hasnt already. Hopefully he can really reflect and try to discover what hes missing inside. Because really problems are a physical manifestation of the chaos that a person feels.,tobuscus,d25d114,1,t5_2sjca
7277279,0,t3_4f0tyw,I dont really think he needs to do a video explaining his actions. If he his PR team and legal team are smart they are already filing suits against April and Katers.  Ive always kind of been on the fence about the rape and drugging claims. The only claims that I am believing are that hes a terrible BF even worse business partner and during the course of his life that hes essentially ruined a lot of friendships and relationships as well as his drug problems. I know from those two videos it seemed like he was getting help. But with most addicts its always possible for them to relapse specially if his trigger is people on the internet or his youtube career and all the Yes Men.  Which is why I still stand by that he needs to retire for awhile maybe a year or two at least. get away from everybody that is a bad influence on him and focus on becoming a better person.,tobuscus,d25dma7,1,t5_2sjca
7278057,0,t1_d25bndd,I agree with you completely but I can still feel bad for Tobys particular circumstances.,tobuscus,d25gszm,1,t5_2sjca
7298672,0,t3_4fctov,In my own honest opinion the only way I can see Tobys YouTube career continuing is if he comes completely clean. No more goofy voices no more being the fakey everything in my life is good amp I cant stop smiling Toby. Personally I would definitely watch a road to redemption series centered around him getting clean and getting therapy for his issues. I think people would appreciate the confirmation that there is a real person behind the persona and a lot of his fans would love to meet the real Tobuscus. This is all assuming only the drug abuseADHD stuff is true and not the rape itself. ,tobuscus,d27t5cm,39,t5_2sjca
7317609,0,t3_4f9w1q,We will never get the entire picture of his social life andor whether he committed these atrocious acts or not...all we have to go on are anecdotes from other unpopular YouTubers that say he is guilty of the more serious crimes of drugging and raping as well as the media as a whole.  Unless you see images of Toby in a prison jumpsuit and shackles the world will never know what was truth and what was fiction...and even then there will be a lot of answers that the world might never get to hear of.  Personally I have no respect for people who make rape allegations on Tumblr or Facebook as this method of ousting someones past history isnt because the poster wants him to be arrested or have to answer to the law its because they are seeking revenge and are out to defame the subjects character.  I liked AprilEfff and Katers very much until this past week or two and now I have no respect for them  whether their posts are true or false.  They resorted to defamation instead of going to law enforcement and filing reports against him...this is the correct way of reporting crimes of this sort even if the accused is found innocent or if it takes months to years to solve.  I hear of advocacy groups as well as from other people that the accusers are too afraid to go to the police for fear of being publicly humiliated and shamed but by making these posts theyve already hurt their own characters.  They made their beds and now they have to lay in them...even if the allegations are  factual.I was subscribed to Katers back when she was still relevant and a part of the YouTube community and I even went to a public gathering where I got to meet Cory and Kate when they were on the road going around the country.  Now I find myself wishing I hadnt gone to this event because of this drama.  She did not handle this situation the way she should have and thats not a type of person that I look up to.  I still wish her the best of luck in the future and hope shes able to come to terms with whatever happened to her that night whether it was her own mental health issues or because of Toby but no longer consider her a positive contribution to the YouTube society.  As brash as this sounds its just my personal opinion and have no expectations of people agreeing with me...and I understand if you feel otherwise and respect your opinion as well.  I feel the same for AprilEfff and wish her the best of luck but no longer think that she should be considered a YouTuber that should be looked up to.  I dont even know that Toby should be considered a person that should be idolized as much as he iswas but time will tell for him.,tobuscus,d29ynqy,3,t5_2sjca

7644728,0,t1_d3b4qby,Yes. Rape  rape  rape. To quote DanIAm gtit is a horrific violation of someones body regardless of how brutally the crime is committed. I signed onto this statement when I saidgtYou see being found in a dark alley and beaten into submission as far worse than being violated by someone who loves you against your will only because you have lived neither arguing that in fact gtthese two events can be far more similar than you realize.But you thought you could pull a fast one by quoting me out of context right back at me! You Toby supporters hear one thing and then repeat one different... sgtnot worse  same crime  same punishmentAgain we do not live in lala platonic ideals land and Im discussing the nittygritties of law. Intent and extent always matter in law so even if everything you wrote up to here had been correct you still wouldnt have proven any inconsistency. For instance if I murder someone in a fit of passion for sleeping with my wife and robbing from my pension fund I will receive a different sentence than if I commit a hate crime and shoot a man because hes Nigerian. In a way why I killed the guy kind of doesnt matter for him hes just as dead either way. The legal system takes a different standard than just damage to the victim and apportions punishments differently. In the same way all rape is horrific for the victim and I dont support using the experiences of some survivors to minimize the experiences of others because at the end of the day they have all been raped. But the legal system considers intent and means when they sentence and so in practice a violent rape at gunpoint and a nonviolent rape with an unknowing rapist will be penalized differently. I am ok with this because there is more to justice than just damage to the victim. None of this is contradictory but it may be more nuanced than you are used to especially if you havent studied much legal shit.,tobuscus,d3b5xfq,2,t5_2sjca
