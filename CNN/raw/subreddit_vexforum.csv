11802032,0,t3_68ebtz,Were thinking a simple Double Reverse Four Bar geared  with four motors in the middle and tensioned for speed. Also a one or two motor claw that formfits to the cone. If there are extra motors you could use them for a turbo base since speed is a big thing with an open field.submitted by LHS Team B B | Loudonville OH on T.Z,vexforum,dgxsus9,1,t5_3f8gn
11802033,0,t3_68ebun,They are not as strong but i dont see why you couldnt use them because many teams use it regularly steel is more springy and aluminium is a but stiffer but steel can hold more weight. Overall the lightness of aluminium is a clear advantage though.submitted by ZachY Y | somewhere in the cosmos  on T.Z,vexforum,dgxsuxi,1,t5_3f8gn
11802068,0,t3_68ecmd,gt  As long as none of the cones on the mobile goal touch the robot.As long as the robot only touches the cone it is putting on the stack OR the top cone of the stack. Once it has the stack the robot can move around with it while touching the top cone because by definition that would be the only cone it possesses.submitted by Elohssa  on T.Z,vexforum,dgxt02h,1,t5_3f8gn

11802070,0,t3_68ecmt,gt DanielB how heavy are those things? I already have a strategy to clear the entire field in  minutes...... as long as they are less than  lbs each...Cones are more than a fourth of a pound. And the movable goals are . pounds.submitted by Mystical Pie Northern Hemisphere on T.Z,vexforum,dgxt0cz,1,t5_3f8gn
11805552,0,t3_68gaxy,We had both an Xdrive and mechanum drive in Toss up they both could go over the bump pretty easily. The XDrive did sometimes burn out but that was with a heavy robot and a much bigger bump than . Though I definitely wouldnt suggest using mechanums.submitted by DanielIW  | Texas on T.Z,vexforum,dgy77py,1,t5_3f8gn
11805553,0,t3_68gay4,Youll also have to look at how high a stack can be and still be stable.submitted by trader.aaron W on T.Z,vexforum,dgy77v8,1,t5_3f8gn
