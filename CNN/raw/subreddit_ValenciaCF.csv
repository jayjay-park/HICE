3884520,0,t3_34xvy5,I am fully prepared for a th place finish. I am more worried about Sevilla taking our Champions league spot with a win in the final of the Europa league. They are currently facing Fiorentina in the semi final round and will either find Dinipro or Napoli in the final. I expect a  loss to Real Madrid. And wins in the next two matches. Hopefully Malaga can take Sevilla down in the final matchweek and make it a much smoother transition. I am not sure how it may be decided if we share the same points. I have missed most of the matches of the second half due to real life things so I am unable to comment on the signings but I feel I am allowed to expect a little more from Nuno considering the fact that Lim invested so much into this team already. Hoping for a rd place finish next season. I really do not see why we cant top Atletico especially following the departure of their three best players last season. ,ValenciaCF,cqz2hdw,2,t5_2szqx

10894799,0,t3_5vmo14,We need to keep the intensity level we have against Madrid or Barcelona vs the lower tier teams but thats not a thing of this year been happening for many years now...,ValenciaCF,de3pz1s,1,t5_2szqx
