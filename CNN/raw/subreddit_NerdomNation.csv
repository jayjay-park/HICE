7507389,0,t3_4i6j81,Hey There!So Yeah Spiderman was amazing. Hands down has cemented himself as the best and most true version of Peter Parker yet. I really connected with him when Tony came to recruit him.  Black Panther was all of the cool and intimidating. Still really wanted to see him hurt someone though. Got to be honest I wanted him to kill Zemo at the end but I guess it was more heroic to have him save his life. AntMan had the line of the movie I believe this is yours Captain America. LOL. The whole theater was dying. Giantsized Lang was great. Loved him in the movie even though he was sort of out of place. The final fight was great and emotionally riveting of course but damn man Cap was completely wrong on this one. ,NerdomNation,d2vjvlt,1,t5_3c5x7
