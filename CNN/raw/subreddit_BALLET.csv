1254705,0,t3_28fwmo,Ok. Im  female and I take ballet amp pointe with the teen an pre pro level girls and also adult beginnerintermediate level ballet classes. Usually I dont sweat as much in the adult classes but I do sweat a lot at the barre on the other classes. Sometimes I joke and say my back is crying thats how much I sweat. Dripping forehead noticeable wet patches line down my chest patch of sweat at my lower back in colored leotards etc. Im  my weight has ranged from  while Ive taken classes so now Im about ish and would say I sweat as much as I always have in ballet amp pointe. I usually dont sweat if its not a strenuous really good warmup barre though. Weve had a fair amount of turnover with our instructors and with the better ones I always sweat more. Ive gotten used to just blotting my backchestface during water breaks though. The only ones who say anything are my mom and sister who also in my classes but nobody else really says anything about it. ,BALLET,ciarpil,4,t5_2rpdx
1463237,0,t3_2awzi7,I love that lightbulb feeling when you suddenly breakthrough! As far as pointing feet go kam is right that you do still need to point your toes but the focus should be at the joint of the metatarsal head and proximal phalanx. What sometimes happens when people think of pointing their toes is bending at the joints of the distal and proximal phalanges which flattens the arch and creates extra tension in the Achilles tendon. What helps me is thinking of the line of the top of my foot. Also working through the foot helps me to engage the muscles in the right order so I dont wind up with scrunched toes by accident. I havent taken many ballet classes lately and the bad habits slip in so quickly!,BALLET,cizoy0l,4,t5_2rpdx

2000310,0,t3_2hn6jk,Make sure the muscles in your arms are engaged....hold your arms very strongly and feel the muscles engaging and connecting through your back.Make sure your arms in en avant are not too high or too low which can throw you off balance.In your prep. plie foreshorten your arm in nd slightly.....so it has a shorter distance to travel to meet the other one. One trick that works for me is to actually move this arm first before anything else....just slightly.Make sure there is pressure between the working foot and the supporting leg....press them intoagainst each other.Pulling up under the working thigh....making a slightly higher passe position can help. Practice just balancing in passe position on a rise. Then  turns then  etc. No matter what continue to hold your working foot in passe after the turn is complete.....to practice....it trains the body to hold the pirouette at the end and not just fall out of it.Make sure the arms are not coming out of en avant part way through the turn. Once they fall apart the turn is pretty much finished.Your preparatory plie should be small and all your weight on the front foot. Something that helps me as I bring in the long arm is to inhale widening my chest and lifting it slightly. Make sure not just the head is spotting but the eyes too. Hope some of this might be helpful. Good luck on your exam! ,BALLET,cku8j9d,9,t5_2rpdx

This type of break often happens when the shoe is too big and you are sitting in it. It can also happen if the shank too hard for you and you are forcing breakage through the ball so then once you are able to achieve full point is buckles back in an opposite way.,BALLET,csphixg,3,t5_2rpdx

6929348,0,t1_d11cuc4,Always wanted to do ballet since a young kid i bought the tights i bought the leotard and i went to dance centers to look thru the window and tried to copy them and looked at books. When my parents found me in my tights practicing around  yrs old i admitted that i wanted to do ballet. They said it was for girls and i was to old and told to stop dressing like a girl. Around  yrs old i was caught hanging around a dance center and my parents where contacted about me stalking the girls at practice. The relationship with my family soon broke down because i wanted to dance and they would not support it. I was driven crazy so i moved out of home and started work. I looked for a place i could start dancing at a teen age but could not find a place that would accept me. I joined a local gymnastics club around yrs old to keep me fit and became a coach. At the age of  i had my mid life crisis and said fuck this i want to learn how to dance. I found a place with an adult class with myself and  ex professional female dancers.I found the level of fitness required for me to dance being a bit on the heavy side and  tall it was so hard i had to train during the week and every chance i got because i needed more and more muscle and stamina to try and keep up with the others in class.I soon became injury prone putting more and more demand on my joints and body and slowly started taking more and more time off.Also the class i went to was not very supportive wouldnt help me out to correct me would tell me i am doing it wrong but not show me how to do or help me individually and was not comfortable helping me stretch out.But I was so happy i was finally learning how to dance ballet.!!!I was a new man i was shopping and practicing my grand plie and had a spring in my step.Until one day the teacher told me to use the mirrors and i hated what i was looking at  small young skinny women doing great positions and me this tall old only man next to them struggling guy in tights dripping in sweat next to them.I lost my confidence and decided to take the summer off because it was just too hot and give me some time to loose more weight so i could perform better and look better in the mirror. I lost about kg and went back to the class But i was still an old guy in tights. Now i go because i love learning it i love doing it. But now i only go once a month if i am feeling up to it and my self confidence can handle it. I got the RAD level DVDs and practice at home weekly just so i can remember everything and keep working on my flexibility. Well done.! Youre awesome.,BALLET,d11rm2q,4,t5_2rpdx

10079723,0,t3_5jyl7b,I would be concerned about taking lessons from someone who wants a student to PERFORM en pointe after less than a year of training. Im going to say what everyone here is being too polite to say directly This is a very bad idea. Your teacher is wrong. You stand a very good chance of doing permanent damage to your ankles hips back andor knees if you dont spend more time like another six months to a year at a bare minimum building your strength and technique before you even try on a pair of pointe shoes. Then you need to spend more time in a studio practicing and building even more strength and technique before you will be ready to perform en pointe which is a completely different animal than doing technique work in a studio even with simplified choreography. Do not let your teacher bully you into this. Whats her rush? Does she have a deal with a local dance store that shes trying to get you to buy shoes from or something? Does she want you as an extra member of the corps to round out a dance shes choreographing? Or worse are you at a competition studio? Whatever it is she cannot possibly have your best interests at heart. Put your foot down. Unless you are a prodigy your body is not ready for this. Dont take my word for it either. Go talk to a teacher at another studio. Take a sample class. Ask when they think you might be ready for pointe. ,BALLET,dblepmy,4,t5_2rpdx

Flat shoes with no arch support and shoes with a narrow or pointy toe box especially heels can cause foot pain and bunions to develope if youre prone to them. You can buy insoles to put in your shoes to give you better arch support or go to a podiatrist and get custom orthodics for your feet. As a lifelong dance thats prone to foot problems my custom orthodics save my feet after I dance but everyones feet are different so YMMV.

10838591,0,t3_5uyl6v,Ive still been really trying to work on getting less afraid of pirouettes en pointe and noticed a couple of things this week. First of all when working on consecutive releve passes my heels come up right before I try to take off which completely ruins any hope I have of getting up onto pointe. So Ive been really really focusing on forcing my heels down before take off. Secondly after a stress fracture in my right th metatarsal last May my right foot is considerably weaker than my left even though my right leg is more stable and strong than my left. So I keep finding myself expecting to be able to turn well on my right leg or spring up on one foot on that side or whatever and being surprised when its much much harder. I guess I really need to focus on strengthening my right foot because its definitely noticeable. I need to force myself to move up a level in classes too I think. I had to drop down from  days a week of class to only  because I have school two nights a week now and  of those four are with a teacher who I love as a person but dont really like her classes.
