Its been  days I didnt post here right from the beginning and I couldnt keep troubleshooting for longer because I have stuff to deliver on Sunday. Always glad I keep a separate home partition.

606500,0,t3_212xez,When I was using Fedora as my primary linux distro it was as a continuation of my years of using RedHat before Fedora existed. I liked the fact it was bleeding edge and later on the emphasis on integrating security  and virtualization tech as well as pushing open driver initiatives. I still keep a Fedora VM around these days as a mile marker of where RedHat may be going but my primary machines have moved over to Arch. The reason for that comes down to two simple things. The first is the rolling release model which virtually no one does better than Arch and very few even bother to attempt. The second reason was the hit or miss release quality thats perhaps an unavoidable side effect of the release cycle. Honestly if theyd take steps to turn Rawhide or some variant thereof into a continuously viable rolling platform rather than the extremely volatile development pit it iswas Id consider moving back into the Fedora ecosystem. ,Fedora,cg97nb6,2,t5_2qm0k

3387959,0,t1_cpdwl51,I have some good news!  After several hours of banging my head against the wall a combination of reading documentation and a little message from uTomahawkChopped got this squared away.I looked up a little more about modules but had a little trouble finding out how to load them initially.  A lot of the documentation I found via google was outdated and the ways that things like this have been done have changed a number of times...looks like at one point you actually had to write a script.  The first hints I got were when I gave up googling and actually searched for terms in the official fedora documentation. Why does it never show up in my google results?!Anywho the command modprobe ran as root via sudo or su is what actually loads a module but just for the time being.  Loading a module via the CLI will go away once you reboot.  So I tried      modprobe thinkpadacpiand got an error that it could not load the device didnt exist.From what Ive read this happens from time to time but theres another statement you can add  forceload  which does exactly that.  So type this       modprobe thinkpadacpi forceloadand it works like a charm.  You can use the brightness keys right then and there...in fact the little gear pulls up system settings Ive switched back to gnome long story and the other keys pull up home folder etc.  Fantastic!But gone after reboot.Figuring out how to make this change persistent was a little more tricky.  The way to persistently load modules in f is to add a conf file to the directory etcmodulesloaded.d.The conf file should just have the name of the module you want to load with a comment if you want and it is supposed to load.  So I tried first the name of the module and nothing else.  Then I tried it with the forceload statement neither of which worked.  Thats when I got a reply from uTomahawkChopped that fixed it.Run the following as root    echo thinkpadacpi gt etcmodulesload.dthinkpadacpi.conf    echo options thinkpadacpi forceload gt etcmodprobe.dthinkpadacpi.conf    rebootThe two echo statements add a string to a file...for instance the first one adds thinkpadacpi to a file it creates thinkpadacpi.conf which is in the indicated path.  The second adds the qualifying option to modprobe. The third of course reboots.This got everything working perfectly after reboot.  Again many thanks to uTomahawkChopped.,Fedora,cpegdbb,1,t5_2qm0k

We are the . of the worlds population that run Linux and then Fedora and not the more popular Ubuntu. Is there anyone out here who isnt tweaking his OS? If you ask this question on Ubuntu forums you get an answer asking you to add kernelppa and an apt get update to see what kernels you can install. . It helped me get some of the newer kernel patches before they were released eventually especially the fix to the Samsung ssd bug.  Kernel . has a fix to the permanent hardware brick due to rm efivars which I have a chance of hitting since Im moving around partitions for my lvm mounts. And this is the answer I get.

For example Fedora just rolled back Node.js to .x because it cant reasonably support nonLTS releases.However some types of changes cant be so easily undone. For example rolling back a compiler after a merged mass rebuild is rather hard because it requires yet another mass rebuild to undo everything which induces even more testing which would cause more delays unto itself.

7909378,0,t1_d42za7w,There are definitely issues with Zypper though.A few issues that Ive seen. It really doesnt express or handle multilibmultiarch packages very well because SUSE doesnt use multilibmultiarch packaging. . Something about how it handles DeltaRPMs causes it to crash and burn randomly on Fedora. Ive not really pinned down the issue yet but it was occurring with libzypp ... Ive not tested yet with libzypp .... There are interesting gaps of functionality in Zypper such as the inability to access the history and act upon it like in Yum and DNF. In addition the mechanisms used for excluding or including packages in repo files does not work in Zypper and several other parameters dont work as you would intuitively expect such as the noninteractive options.. It does a really bad job of detecting what type of repodata is being used if it isnt specified in the repo file. Since Fedora uses exclusively rpmmd and the characteristics of it are pretty obvious its weird that it doesnt pick up that by default.. It doesnt support comps composition groups as installable patterns.

8626000,0,t3_4y00b8,I have always been stuck with in house software that must be run on Windows currently we have software that we develop in house that only uses thick clients either as a standalone client or something requiring IE for everything to work properly. Sadly I havent been in a position where I can actually live in whatever Linux distro for work.That being said I do use my own Fedora  laptop when I work from home. Some of our stuff works in FirefoxChrome so I use that and Empathy for our messaging we use AOL messenger at work no idea why tbh. I did connect Evolution to Exchange and it worked fairly well though I made an effort to change fonts to something that wasnt displaying wonky on Windows I think I mostly just made text smaller by a point or two. I also prefer using a Linux terminal emulator to PuTTY on Windows and would have a Fedora VM handy just for that but a customers vendor introduced me to SuperPuTTY and its pretty slick so I dont use that VM anymore.I did use various Linux exclusively at school while I attended though. I basically submitted all of my work as a PDF where possible and made one teacher suffer through my LibreOpenOffice work for another class he understood and found it funny so long as it wasnt a huge formatting problem.

I dont believe it even has anything to do with the amount of rules since those are normally fast to load.Youd probably be surprised then how inefficient that was in the past according to the main author. Meanwhile the lowlevel stuff firewalld uses doesnt require him to create single rules for changes during runtime IIRC.gtAlso disabling firewalld is unlikely to shorten boot time by the exact amount reported. And since it varies wildly from one machine to the next other issues contributing to the long reported startup time are almost a certainty.Agreed.gtThat said maybe its worth a look through the code. Its always possible something could be simplified optimized ignored or delayed.That possibility always exists though delaying something doesnt sound very feasible to me you dont want to start out with an open firewall which then gets tightened and on the other hand later services may rely on that the firewall properly configured lets certain network traffic through which they need to function.gtBut iptables works just fine so not much motivation...Heh yeah unless you want the dynamic reconfiguration of the firewall the benefit of firewalld and its tools are mostly the abstraction andor the graphical editor.,Fedora,d6m9cjc,1,t5_2qm0k
