3331247,0,t3_2yaoti,I dont think its a paradox. A simulation is by definition programmed. Even if there are random events coded into the simulation the only way the a mind would be able to recognize that its in a simulation is if its written into the simulations code that the mind would recognize this i.e. the mind would never take on a lifepath on its own independent of its programming. And if its only recognizing that its in a simulation because its been coded into the program to recognize that fact then would we really say that it recognized it was in a program on its own if it was an inevitable result in code driving the simulation? I personally wouldnt say its paradoxical or counterintuitive because it was a rational event that was destinedprogrammed to happen by the programmer of the simulation and could never be said to be an event that happened independently of its programming. For it to be a true paradox in my mind the event of a mind recognizing that its living in a simulation would have to also be existing independent of its code on some parallel level I.e. the recognition of a mind living in a simulation would essentially have to go against its programming. I guess the logic behind this question is very similar to the premise of the movie The Matrix. The only way for someone to recognize theyre living in the matrix is to see something happen that would defy the logic of the simulation a glitch in the matrix and if its a glitch or something outside of the programming that gives it this information then the minds would also have to exist independent of the world they live in in the real world to defy the programming of their simulation. In order to recognize theyre in a simulationthe matrix their true existence would have to be driven from somewhere outside of the simulation the real world or else its recognition of living in a simulation would be part of the code of the simulation and be very rational not paradoxical. Sorry for the long response I just had to think through the logic of the issue at least my opinion of how the situation would have to exist in order to be truly paradoxical. ,logic,cp7zlid,1,t5_2qubs

A valid sentence is one where that sentence is true in all models.

7406952,0,t3_4gra60,I just read the wikipedia explanation  . My understanding is this  It shows that a formula T for Truth cannot exists so I think your questions are meaningless  you are asking what property the T formula would have if it existed  but it doesnt.To really understand what a Truth predicate means you must investigate model theory You have a langage L say first order arithmetic axioms and rules of inference which define what formulas are theorems of the theory lets say Peano axioms.formulas are things like   ExVy xythe above formula is not a theorem because it can not be proved from the axioms of the theory.Now the very important thing is how you interpret the formulas. Just like in english there is a difference between the words and the meaning of words  ex there is a difference between the word tree and an actual tree. You could use another word to denote a tree for example apple. Why not ? It is the same in mathematical logic. So to judge the truth of a formula you must define a mapping between formulas and what they are supposed to mean. Such a mapping is called a model. Then you can ask if such or such formula is true.Now what tarski theorems states is that for any model M of the theory peano there is no way to define truth in the langage of the theory itself  there is no formula Tf such that Tf is true if and only if f is true as interpreted in the model MHope it helps I may be wrong on some details but I think my overall explanation is correct,logic,d2k4em5,1,t5_2qubs

9241027,0,t1_d8n7li6,I have some thoughts about the topic but I dont know exactly what the author had in mind.When you have first order logic FOL with identity my impression is that the interpretation of  is fixed. In classical set theoretic models it is interpreted as the diagonal of the domain the set  x x | x  D  where D is the domain of the model.In FOL without identity you can still add a relation symbol  with suitable axioms. If you add reflexivity symmetry and transitivity it will be an equivalence relation but you cannot force the interpretation to be the same as above. If you add a substitution principle then all properties you can express in your logic will respect the equivalence relation but it need still not be interpreted as the diagonal.If you have that  is an equivalence relation then your set  a  b Pa Pb  may be consistent. If you have a substitution axiom it will be inconsistent. Just as we can say the equality relation is bad we can say your property P is bad  it does not respect equality. From a classical point of view this distinction of identity and equality is not as important as in constructive logic.  In classical logic you can turn any equivalence relation into an identity relation on a set in two ways  work with equivalence classes or  use choice to get a representative. Neither of these approaches are general straight forward solutions in constructive logics. For instance Bishop in his development of constructive analysis did not have a given equality relation which he extended but rather defined different independent equivalence relations as needed. When he introduced a new function he would need to prove that the function respects the relevant equality i.e. xy gt fx  fy and similar for properties.Regarding decidability I dont understand it either. I dont think she is talking about definitional equality in type theory which is decidable. For PA it is a theorem that identity is decidable.,logic,d8nd8ej,3,t5_2qubs

So have a look at my comments and maybe reformulate if the question still makes sense.. The Reals are uncountably infinite because you cannot come up with a procedure for writing them in a list and say for any given real number that if you continue the list for long enough that number will be on the list.. Something is countably infinite if you can come up with a list and be sure that every item is on it eventually. In other words something is countably infinite if theres a onetoone correspondence between it and the natural numbers imagine the natural numbers counting off the elements in the list as in this list. This is like when we say if theres a onetoone correspondence between hats and people there must be the same number of hats as people.. Sort of... There are countably infinite numbers in the list . . . ... but that isnt really important. Whats important here is that you can write any number of nines and be sure that its in the sequence and hence as you go down the sequence the number gets as close to  as you care to specify.. No! This is exactly wrong. No matter how many s you add .... is never equal to .
