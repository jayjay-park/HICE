1634551,0,t1_cjl6x16,Im no expert but I would probably try doing some front squats to practice a more upright position in the hole. Or else just a ton of lighter weight squat volume but with a more upright torso. Also to remedy your lower back rounding some stretching or more stretching might be in order. You do have decently long femurs like I do which makes it really hard to stay upright unless you have godly ankle flexibility. Like I said though youre strong like bull but having your back parallel to the floor in a squat is less than ideal.,LiftingVideos,cjl77uu,2,t5_30t7b

2078192,0,t3_2iokph,probably addressed somewhere before now but whats with the straps? im guessing a comfort issue? curious if your elbowstriceps ever hurt from pulling on the straps to stabilize. ,LiftingVideos,cl3zf25,2,t5_30t7b
2193268,0,t3_2k50g5,Im not saying the deadlift wasnt impressive.  Im really not.  Closing in a lb deadlift especially if natural is a fucking accomplishment but this fella has GREAT deadlift leverages.That squat though...Did you see that fucking squat? Holy Jeezus tapdancing Christ you guys........  Im just going to pretend hes wearing  pairs of squat briefs because with those leverages holy shit.I mean seriously.,LiftingVideos,clim9ud,1,t5_30t7b
2478812,0,t1_cmi42e9,Sometimes strength does that. Ill make slow progress for a while and then suddenly a lift will jump  lbs out of nowhere. What does your programming look like?,LiftingVideos,cmi49v0,1,t5_30t7b
2600626,0,t3_2pmhp6, bench was the last goal I wanted to achieve before the end of the year. It was extremely ugly and there was no pause. I was probably even at risk of injury from the way my hip rose a bit on the one side. Since Im not planning on doing any competitions in the near future Im not going to worry too much about it and just be happy that Im making some progress again. This has been a problematic lift for me over the last year and a half and I wish I could say that I dont really care about the bench but I really do and I work hard to make the small progress that I get.My goal for the next year is to get a  squat a  bench and a  deadlift. Calling it here so if this time next year I havent hit those goals we can all look back and have a Nelson style ha ha,LiftingVideos,cmy1f8z,3,t5_30t7b
