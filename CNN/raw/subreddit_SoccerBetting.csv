I have had win over the last few daysweeksDC United  away to Montreal   .Brazil to win BTTS  . yesterdayPOrtugal  vs Ireland   .France vs Jamaica   . Aswell as others.My point is I will be continuing this in the World Cup too and I will post my picks here in case anyone wishes to follow. This is purely low stakes and take at your own risk.Pick   Mexico    .. Mexico look a better team than Cameroon Cameroons best days are past them now. Etoo is too old and they lack the attacking threat they may have once carried. Their record is not the best at World Cups either. Failing to win in  in  matches and only winning once in .Mexico are a much more experienced opponent and the climate should suit them more. Pick   Spain to win to nil vs Holland  .Not as high as I would have liked but still a good bet none the less. Spain only conceded twice in the last World Cup on the way to winning it. And in qualifying they kept  clean sheets. Possession is key in Brazil and there is no better side on the planet than Spain at keeping the ball. Holland dont look as strong as in the past and with Van Persie not playing as much football as he would have liked before the World Cup its hard to see where there goals are going to come from tonight. Pick   Chile   vs Australia  .Chile look a dark horse in this years competition. I was very impressed with them when they faced England in a friendly and beat us . They kept the ball well and looked very explosive on the break. Australia are going to struggle this time around. Their squad looks very weak on paper and I expect them to be struggling this time around. All in an accumulator  .. However i usually bet singles and cover all angles.

Its so easy to fix on that   mark and the odds close to  and start looking from there.

2449064,0,t3_2nir5v,It can be tricky to pull a profit from Europa League games mostly because they can be somewhat random depending on who gives a damn and also being a big competition the bookies have their guys making sure they pull a profit. Honestly I dont see any odds that I would be comfortable with for a fulltime result. So I am going to try and go into some of the more obscure markets.. First bet that really jumps out to me is Wolfsburg . corners. In Evertons last  away league game corners look like this           The   games were against Sunderland and Burnley they still lost the corners battle even though they were the superior team. The other  games were Man United Liverpool and West Brom which I thik gives a true reflection on how many corners they give away to attacking teams while playing away from home. In Their  Europa games away from home they gave Lille  corners and got  of their own. They gave Krasnodar  corners and got  of their own. Wolfsburg got  corners at home to Krasnodars . They also got  corners to Lilles . Strangely Wolfsburgs last home league game ended in  corners to .. which is just a completely freak game which I dont really know what to take from it. If you bet on under  corners in a game you get between  and  to .. so.. Moving on.. Prior to that freak game Wolfsburg got  corners to Mainzs .  to Augsburgs .  to Werder Bremens .  to Leverkusens ... I could keep going.. Basically Id say the chances of Wolfsburg getting the most corners is like . That bet is . odds. . should be solid and is at . odds.

Eather a stable home win were hometeam walk all over the away team and win with two goals margin or the one were the away team score  goal and shut down the game and get away with a win.

This is where they profit. Second if they can make so much money off their tips why do they need to sell them?

3149871,0,t3_2w79ms,Im not saying that you are addicted to betting but this how the reward system is described to work when addicted to betting. When you take a drug or perform an action betting activates the brains reward system and it released a neurotransmitter dopamine which creates a comfort and a sense of satisfaction. Some choose to call it kick. These positive memories etched in large cerebral cortex and the memory of satisfaction will make you want to repeat the action. These strong traces in the brain or drug memories can be left in for long periods of abstinence. An individual who is dependent has developed a sensitized hypersensitive reward system. This means that the craving for the drug or behavior problems are very easily aroused. The sensitization has also importance to the compulsive nature of gambling gets the fullblown gambling addiction but also the loss of control that the gambling may experience recurrence or when you try to limit gambling. Our brain however large capacity for recovery and this hypersensitivity arising from the abuse may decrease and cease completely.In some individuals may be an increased biological vulnerability to develop addictions that can be explained by inherited behavior in the brains reward system. This is now well described in terms of substance dependence. Some similar studies in terms of genetic vulnerability for developing gambling problems are not yet available. The hypothesis that some may be more vulnerable than others though and it is based on clinical observations. The individual inherits a biological vulnerability that along with other factors such as severe life events and exposure of the game represented a high risk of developing an addiction.used google translate on this text,SoccerBetting,coohbpf,2,t5_2r4wz

Cracovia  Piast Gliwice      One of the first data that show up on Polish league for me. It indicate value here on draw ofcourse. It would be crazy if another game ends up .

If you had followed Hobro from round  in Danish superleague with  unit bet you would have won  units.   bets that means   increase of bankroll. Thats extreme and crazy. I simply read the numbers and I figure I can give this a go. Midtjylland have also been very good this season  u at same type of calculation. So this is no  and no  on the moneymaker list this season so far. As always becuse I bet against the favorite here Midtjylland doesnt mean that I think they cannot win.

3909876,0,t1_cr1qepk,I think theyre worth it for the money. They are a solid team and Orlando is still figuring things out. New England is in form theyve won  of their last  the one mistake being a draw to Columbus who is alright. Orlando has only won  of their last  and theyve played mid level teams and lost to the last place team in the east which is toronto who should be good but havent played well. Both teams average a little above  goals per game in their games so over . might look good. Orlando likes to push its outside backs so Aguedelo and Davies should have some space to be fed by Jones Fagundez and Nguyen. Orlando also just lost their starting right winger for the season and he had played all of their games. Also travel and time zone shouldnt be too bad it will be  degrees at game time though.Im glad you posted this. I was going to start to focus solely on the MLS and try to provide some good analysis.

Its not like theyd post it in here screaming about how much of a loser in the dictionary sense they are though. The bookies dont get rich by giving away a lot of money. Unless you have a good strategy or mind the house edge built into every single option will eat away at you not to mention bankroll. I myself am in the green but i just consider it some lucky picks at the right stakes usually i just level stake everything. If you want money get a job.

Whaaat.I feel you can keep on betting on Bet much longer than on MarathonBwinUnibet and so on.Unibet was the first bookie I ever used and like many others I was a losing player when I started so I had extra room on Unibet when I started winning. Yet my Unibet account was limited wayy before Bet. MarathonBwin was very quick on the limitation. Thats what Ive from many others aswell that Bet is not the first one to limit you. I was winning from day  on Bet and I made the most amount of money on Bet than on other bookies like Unibet. Always kept it bank rollmanagement. But I did follow these steps under and that may have made it better. I esp. think making mainstream bets like on Premier League and such will make your account much harder for the bookmaker to catch up.ON TOPIC Heres a few of my tips on how to keep your account longer. Place some random bets happily parlays on big leagues like Premier League which is not likely good bets at all because this makes you look like your not really sharp at all.. If its not absolutely necessary dont send bets in for manual acceptance to the traders they will look tru your account.. Dont talk to customer service unless its absolutely necessary. I talked to the customers service on a betting site called Betsson and  minutes after that but account was limited to almost none.. Dont play on just dropping odds. An easy way of making money on sportsbetting is lineshopping placing the bet on the bookmaker that has yet to react on a marketchange. This is very easily traceable and I got my Betway account rekt after just  bets doing this. So basicly mix it up gotta be smart about it.,SoccerBetting,ctg4m0v,3,t5_2r4wz

4949772,0,t3_3imriy,France Ligue Dijon CreteilThese two played out a  minute  draw here in Dijon in the cup just  days ago with the hosts progressing on penalties. That was not really against the grain when these two clubs meet and the previous two league meeting here had gone overand Dijon have scored five in two visits to Creteil. The hosts have scored two goals in each of two home starts since so are clearly finding goals fairly easy to come by and they will be pleased with back to back clean sheets in those too but the last two times they kept teams out for  minutes they played Creteil at home next and we alreday know what happened in those and we can see a hattrick completed today.  The vistors have conceded in all five competitive matches this season two or more in two of the last three and whilst their only win was a  home defeat of Bourg en Bresse Peronnas  where they really rode their luck and could have easily lost they have managed to score in every start and I expect both teams on the scoresheet today. Really adventurous looking home squad and Julio Tavares a player we discuss regularly will be looking to score against Creteil for the third match running.

Not arbitrary.gtYou act like the markets and bookies are perfectly pricing matches based on probability and if they didnt theyd immediately go broke.Ive not said that. I said that that bookies that do not limit you will not let you exploit inefficiencies over time. You wont find these inefficiencies on markets big enough for Pinnacle et. al..gtIn a game between United and Stoke there will be people who bet on United because they like United there will be people who bet on Stoke because they have a feeling that Stoke will win  these reasons have absolutely no bearing on the result of the match yet they influence odds. There you have even more separation of implied odds from reality.While mug punters exist the lines at bookies that do not limit will largely be controlled by syndicates and professionals. gtYou talk about bookies banning people  there is a reason for that! Because making high returns consistently is obviously possible.Making returns as high as you talk about will not be possible consistently because you will be limited before you reach the kind of sample I talked about.gtTo give you an example of a bet that returns that sort of value  over the last  seasons in the A league over  of the Matches in the first three rounds have been under . average odds for under during this period is ..

He told the Belgian press he will be willing to take risks and thanks to his teammates who can keep the ball will get a lot of opportunities to score.

7233800,0,t3_4egdxi,Atletico Madrid v Barcelona BTTS  .Id love to bet on Atletico but as you can see here they have been beaten at home and away against Barcelona the last seven times. Beyond that a lot of draws. Theyre both extremely good sides and Atletico have the bonus of getting an away goal so they are going to come into the game looking to score to build on that. Atletico home form  wins from the last  games only one loss involved with a weird game against Celta Vigo.Barcelona away form Similar to that of Atletico in terms of wins and draws. Mostly score two goals when away. This leaves me thinking that they both have the quality and motivation to score. Atletico home form  away goal means they are still in for a big chance. Barcelona needs to get at least a goal to cancel out Atletico away goal advantage. Trying to play for a  is way too risky. There is more at stake than just the champions league too Barcelona and AM are seperated by a mere  points in the La Liga and time is running out. Ideally both teams would like to take both trophies home so this is a pretty big clash of the titans coming up. Goals are a must! ,SoccerBetting,d20fi22,9,t5_2r4wz

7307889,0,t3_4fbwcy,Djurgarden  Hammarby    uLast game of game week  of allsvenskan and its a Stockholm derby. As usual I analyze odds from past years round  of Allsvenskan so get a feel for what odds that may work out. What I can see here is that the output of units is abit more on away win than homewin adjusting all the data to my moneymanagment. The problem is that you have to put more units on the table to bring in almost same result in units as away win were you have less units at stake. Meaning higher ROI on away win as far as I can see but less hitrate compared with homewin. Here is the thing. You can probably pick Djurgrden at home at  but you will probably be very close to the value. Draw looks like a losing pick and ofcourse because I mention this this game will probably end up a draw LOL. My last results in Allsvenskan can be found here gt ,SoccerBetting,d28uvan,0,t5_2r4wz

7343471,0,t3_4fuafx,My picks for today are        Derry City  Bohemian FC   .  Derry have a good run this far and are a force at home atm while Bohemian kinda struggle to win games.  Bohemian is also missing Mark Quigley  one of their most valuable players offensively.      Fortuna Duesseldorf  St. Pauli   .  St Pauli have a very good season and even have small chances to get to relegation instead of Nrnberg.  I dont know the reason of the high odds for Pauli win  maybe because of some injuries and away game   but i am confident they wont lose against Dsseldorf...  If you arent feeling risky you can even go for X on this one!      But be aware the German nd Bundesliga is very hard to predict and upsets happen a lot..  Same thing here with Freiburg they are the clear Favorite to win but they struggled hard last week against Braunschweig and are almost surely through to Bundesliga .  I still bet on them at . because Duisburg are last of the table and suck away from home!        My last Bet is Nice  Reims   .  I hate to bet against teams that are at the edge of relegation but in this case i am pretty sure Nice wants to get to that rd place champions league qualification and fight for everything they got in these few last matchdays..  I am placing a Lucky   singles   doubles   trebles and  trixie.  Good Luck to all of you and sorry for the Oxford draw ,SoccerBetting,d2cwhjn,1,t5_2r4wz

8191270,0,t1_d51fmcl,Thanks for providing constructive feedback To preface my response id like to acknowledge that such organisationsbusinesses whom utilise a similar model which ive proposed do pay analysts very good money to conjure extremely analytical data on fixtures which is hard to rival or duplicate especially for a subreddit.Though im thinking that most people whom id consider suitable for working on this would follow this structure in producing picks After selection the New picker lets call him would then choose a league. Literally any league which is heading said countrys footballing competition st nd rd and potentially th devision. Further this chosen league cannot house the team they actively support and by support I mean watch all fixtures keep up to date bet on regularly etc. An exception may be made with the BPL La Liga. Literally scroll down the fixture list until you find a fixture Does that fixture have a side in which is in good form against a side currently struggling? Perhaps above the opposing team considerably within the leagues table more than one clear advantage are both teams scoring regurlarly corner predictions etc. Find the odds for said fixture and your pick Post them on the Google document with a note attached with your Analysis how you came to that pick detailing how the team is doing etc.Im aware this seems elementary though if we have multiple people on leagues it will filter statistically backed seemingly glaringly obvious picks to which if  of users on said leagues Doc agree will be passed onto admins of the primary Google Document,SoccerBetting,d51gkv4,1,t5_2r4wz

8209444,0,t1_d53jnro,Yeah sure. However its a hand and clear after one just the game before. So the German really fucked up on this one it shouldnt have happened. So yeah France was lucky but its more of a lucky that Germany wasnt great.Anyway I was talking about the game FranceIceland France let them score for a lot of reasons I like to think that they wouldnt have taken much joy from humiliating a little team and they also tried to avoid yellow in order to have everyone against Germany.Finally for the next game I think it can be important to understand that yes France had a big problem on the defensive side and still has it but most of it was rami I felt like he wanted to be THE man  but not in a good way as he took too much risk. Im not a fan of the man...IMO Frnce took  goals  penalties and  against Iceland. The penalties are an issue almost one today with Pogba but those against Iceland shouldnt be a point to show a weakness for the finale. But Im not saying that France cant concede goals as they obviously can. I just seems to me that there is on overreaction and I had it before.,SoccerBetting,d53qhhs,1,t5_2r4wz

8333458,0,t3_4tje07,Champions League QualificationNorrkping  RosenborgUnder  goals  .Under  goals between IFK Norrkping and Rosenborg in the return leg. This means push at three goals loss at four and win at zero one and two. to RBK in the first leg even though it was  at halftime after a half with few chances. The result came after IFK Norrkpings reservkeeper let in a few simple goals. IFK didnt create much during this game and their goal came somewhat surprising after Sebastian Andersson was left unmarked during a corner.The match wasnt exactly riddled with chances. Four goals is out of the ordinary compared to the amount of chances. In my opinion. Anyhow  in the fist game means that IFK needs to win with  or by three goals to advance. The circumstances seems to make people think that this will be a crazy game filled with chances and goals. It could be but Im not so sure. RBK arent stupid they wont risk anything by charging at IFK too hard and put themselves at risk of conceding a goal. That will lead to a really though night for them. IFK cant attack like madmen either. Letting in a goal will worsen their starting position by a lot. I can see this game being  at half time and a goal in the th minute seems reasonable. I doubt IFKs abilities to take a place in this leg. Theyve lost some players and are considerable weaker now compared to when they qualified. Traustason and Kujovic sold. Tkalkic injured. Old manager Janne Andersson has moved on to the international team. Thats some heavy losses.Even though IFK has a home advantage and playing on artificial turf I dont see them getting into this game. I see a game where Rosenborg pulls down the tempo to prevent IFK to get chances and thus also preventing them from getting the crowd to rally behind them.Best of luck!

9033413,0,t3_53xe0u,. Yes. If one human can become a successful bettor then any human can. If the majority of bettors lose money then dont use the same strategy as the majority of bettors.. Under . goals.. Odds. Nothing else matters. . I bet . of my total betting bank on each bet I make and I make around  bets per week.   . Know what the odds should be. Make a system that uses data to analyse what happens in each game. You can study what is the relationship between shots and goals for example. Back test that system on  years of data and you can come up with around  different categories of what happened in the game and what the final score was. From that you know the probability of what happens if those situations are replicated. Now you can make odds to reflect those probabilities happening. If the bookmaker and your odds differ by  or more you can make a bet.  Seperate your betting bank from your normal bank. Allocate an amount each year to betting that doesnt matter if you lose all of it. Under no circumstances never ever bet more than  of your betting bank on one particular bet. There is no rush to get rich quick gambling will still be around in  years time.  Dont bet accumulators. It is easier for a team to defend than to attack. Teamwork amp organisation is stronger than individuals and creativity. Outwork everyone have clear judgement lose your ego and enjoy what you do.,SoccerBetting,d7xo8u3,2,t5_2r4wz

9250587,0,t3_56y6oi,If you figure out a way to actually get the right probability you will be on the value. The only way to find out if you are on the right side or profit and loss is to give it a go and bet on it many times so you end up with a huge sample of picks. Also with every single bet you do. You can do everything right and select the pick that in the long run is the best way to do it but just this time when you bet on it it simply doesnt work out due to things happening during the game that is difficult to predict. Penaltys injuries errors from the ref and other stuff. So one single pick alone is never a decider if you are doing things right or wrong. You need a huge sample of picks. ,SoccerBetting,d8okuwi,2,t5_2r4wz
9261905,0,t3_578wp8,ALeague  Adelaide United v Western Sydney WanderersInteresting match this one. Both sides go into this one after varied results. Going to make a pick but wouldnt blame you if you skipped this one. I had DNB last weekAdelaide drew with Newcastle last week. Normally this wouldnt be a great result for the reds but considering the squad turnover theyve had during the offseason its not too surprising. The Wanderers went off the pitch last week with their tail between their legs in the derby losing . They looked pretty disjointed up front with defensive lapses killing the game for them. In addition to this their captain Nikolai ToporStanley wont be playing as hes pursuing an overseas opportunity one of their key defenders. I cant see the Wanderers getting much out of the game but think a Draw may be on the cards. Adelaide werent too convincing last week and I think itll take a few more weeks for the team to gel together. Wouldnt be too surprised with a  draw in this one. My pick  Adelaide DNB  ..If adventurous you can also go with Adelaide W  . but Id keep the stakes low if you went for this. ,SoccerBetting,d8q0hcq,9,t5_2r4wz

9357914,0,t1_d91khh2,gtI got the point but they need some kind of proof to convince customers to buy the service. They dont need to disclose the internals of their model but some results on the accuracy would be very nice. After all what will they lose if they publish their predictions on  premier league season? They arent actively looking for customers though. Betegy is an example of a predicting model that is meant to be sold to the public the picks at least and that is why it is also marketed in such a way. StarlizardSmartodds make the bulk of their money from betting on their own picks so they do not need to find customers as they make their own profit.gtThats a very good question and this question goes for these agencies as well. The inherent problem with tipstersprediction services. If you already have a good prediction model or success why would you bother to sell it? you could use your predictions and get your money from bookmakers if you are successful which is their claim.Some people dont have a bankroll big enough to gain enough money to live off of it. Selling your picks means you gain additional income without having to spend more on your own picks. If you are successful people will come and pay for your picks and if you arent successful you shouldnt be selling your picks in the first place D.Ill have to redirect to the first part of this post for your final part. Starlizardsmartodds dont gain anything from attracting attention andor a large following as this will only lose them more money due to the odds dropping. Their game is finding odds that are too high and making money off of that in short its much more difficult than that but this is a tldr. Selling their picks would mean that if they arent quick enough they will lose this value that they found and if they bet before they share the picks they will have to bet on these lower odds.,SoccerBetting,d926lr0,1,t5_2r4wz

9702278,0,t1_da8nbes,Good luck on that Tottenham bet cant see past a Monaco win here wish Spurs would win as im a fan but wont happen. Alderweireld wont be back hopeful for Chelsea game meaning we will have the same back  most likely with the only changes being perhaps Vorm in goal doubt it and Tripper at RB with Davies injured and Rose unable to play at Chelsea due to th yellow card. I cant see Kane starting this game due to him just coming back from injury and a crucial London derby against Chelsea so Jansen will start especially after early sub against West Ham. Lamelas still unlikely and I think Winks will start again with a midfield of Son  Alli. Monaco also rested a lot of players in their game Falcao started on the bench etc. They also played on Friday evening meaning they had the extra days rest to Spurs and dont have to travel. Tottenham must be paying good odds but ill be surprised if Monaco dont win this especially as a win for them guarantees them a spot in the next round and they only need a draw away in Germany to qualify top then. ,SoccerBetting,da90hgu,1,t5_2r4wz

He is the captain you mentioned missing and hes our best defender. They cant score either because Nabbout isnt firing and they dont have a proper striker rather midfielders that have been placed up top. The Jets got some early results but have been average since and look void of ideas. Mariners have found some form minus last weeks drubbing. I actually cant see anything but what you have tipped and it amazes me that the jets are such heavy favourites.

Hopefully another one tonight! The Europa League is very unpredictable so I have tried to stay clear of standard picks like Gent vs Genk BTTS for my main picks although they may be in my fun acca.A few people have asked if they can donate some money as theyve won a lot from my bets. My tips will always be free but as a university student Im never going to say no to donations ahah so my PayPal is  barkercgmail.com. I just want to say a massive thank you to uCoraggiosoo for the first donation ltPicks of the Day  Manchester United vs Rostov  United . Corner Handicap .  Anderlecht Over . Team Goals .     Combined .    Reasoning    Manchester United vs Rostov  United . Corner Handicap . Reasoning  Manchester United host Rostov for this Europa League fixture. United were on great form until their  game unbeaten streak was ended by Chelsea in the FA cup on Monday night. They put up a strong fight but ultimately  found it impossible to keep a clean sheet to an unstoppable Chelsea side especially after Herrera got sent off within the first  minutes. Rostov are also on a decent bit of form as theyre unbeaten in their last  games.The reverse leg of this fixture ended  after a scrappy fight on a god awful pitch in Russia. The pitch was so bad that Rostov are no longer allowed to play at that ground until the pitch is a better standard yet United still managed to get an away goal. All is to play for in this leg.United are a very strong corner team when playing at home especially against weaker sides who they spend most of the game dominating. They have averaged . corners per game in their last  home matches. When they have played worse teams theyve scored very high corner counts such as  against Bournemouth  against Middlesborough and  against Burnley all whilst conceding  across these  matches.Rostov however dont win many corners away In their last  matches theyve averaged . per game. Whilst conceding high corner counts against huge European teams like  against Atletico Madrid  against Ajax and  against Zenit.What makes this bet seem like a banker is when looking specially at homeaway corner counts in ELCL. Rostov have played  away matches in ELCL since  and in those  matches theyve won  corners an average of . per game. In these  matches they have conceded an average of . corners per game.Uniteds last  home matches in ELCL have seen them win an average of . per game and concede an average of . per game. However when playing teams which they dominate theyve scored highs of  Miditylland  CSKA Moscow and  Club Brugge.United will come into this match knowing the FA Cup and Premier League are no longer possible to win so they will be desperate to lift a trophy this season. Ibra isnt suspended for Europa League and he isnt afraid to take a long shot which often leads to corners. United should dominate this game in possession which should see the corners flood in whilst not letting the Rostov corner count reach higher than  maybe . Just for fun Im going to guess that the corner count tonight will end .    Anderlecht Over . Team Goals . Reasoning    Anderlecht are currently on fine form. Their  win over Waasland on Sunday means they face Club Brugge in a playoff match to see who will helm the Belgium Jupiler league title for the  season. Nicosia are also on decent form picking up just  loses in their last  matches including loses to Anderlecht and Athletic Bilbao.Anderlecht have scored a total of  goals in their last  home matches which is an average of . goals per game. Lukasz Teodorczyk is expected to start upfront for this Europa League match and hes bagged a total of  goals this season across all competitions. APOEL have conceded a total of  goals in their last  away matches which is an average of . per game.Similarly to the United pick the solidarity of this bet comes when looking at Europa league form. Anderlecht have scored a total of  goals in their last  home matches in the EL averaging out at . goals per game. APOEL however are awful away in the EL They have conceded a total of  goals in their last  EL away matches averaging  per game.Although Anderlecht won the reverse fixture  they still have work to do to cement a position in the next round. Todays match is a perfect opportunity of them to exert their home dominance against a team who has a very poor away EL record. Anderlecht should quite comfortably be bagging  goals this match.

United Corners    Rostov   United Corners    Rostov    United Corners    Rostov  UNITED DO NOT DO THIS TO ME       Anderlecht GOOOALL     Just under  mins left  more Anderlecht goal required and United to win more corners than they concede     FULL TIME RESULTS  United end  on corners. They got  corners after  minutes yet failed to get anymore.  Anderlecht ends  they only converted  goal from  shots.    My most upvoted post of all time I have failed over  people.

11457679,0,t1_dfultlr,This might be the opposite of a tip. The guy is obviously completely new to soccer betting and will most likely lose his initial money. Like probably most of us did when we started. Thats why he should start playing with small money lt so he doesnt have to learn the hard way and be able to take the hit and work his way back.Play aggressive as a short stack? Please tell me you are kidding. Betting is exactly the opposite. Yes he has to be selective but never get a good portion of it in. Never aggressive.

11531930,0,t1_dg30o6j,First I think this particular post of yours is a much more thoughtful presentation of your concerns. Thanks.Second I fully believe he is genuine based on what he has done to date and if at some point I dont feel that way I will surely say so. I just think it makes sense to take him as face value unless something starts to stink  and I just dont get that in any way here.Finally I think the low number of picks you reference is because he is starting to track tipsters so he can time stamp their picks and track on a forwardlooking basis only and not rely on past posts which could have been edited. This is just my personal understanding and could be dead wrong but I think Im right and its certainly the way it should be done. Someone tracking tipsters should not be reviewing past posts that they cant verify as being the true pick. I will leave it to him to respond or not as he sees fit. Im not suggesting you think it should be done differently of course  just stating my understanding of why the low  of picks.Again  I appreciate the levelheaded calm dialog and its nice to have this stay classy and not devolve into name calling like these things sometimes do.Cheers.,SoccerBetting,dg35a1u,2,t5_2r4wz

The second match hattrickperformance was conditioned by his motivation to recover from the first.Barcelona is losing form I have to agree. Dont know how to analyse motivation for this match... They come from  terrible away results lately but a great return against PSG from  goals behind regardless of penno pen situations Barcelona played a great game. This competition is the single one where we havent really seen Barcelona with terrible performances. I agree with Juve DNB and I have my money there too but Barcelona is not dead.

11573234,0,t1_dg7tigh,gtMaybe get the bot to also post a Future bets thread daily?So you are suggesting a solution were picks should be posted in the wrong day because the bot havent got around to post the daily picks thread for the day you need.

11574532,0,t1_dg7v168,gtYou keep harping on about the bot thing which Ive already said might not be the best idea. Not sure how you can deny having a uniform timezone wouldnt be simpler than having to go and check a Thursday thread at am on a Friday and then check to see if there are any games that are actually happening on Friday for you.Instead you could just look and see oh this MLS game thats happening at  CET pm PST is happening in  minutes better get a bet in. I told you why the bot aint a good idea it seemes like you kind of begin to understand that your suggestion wasnt that good. Why should a MLS game played on Thursday local time be posted in Friday thread because someone decided that at midnight in Europe Thursday turn to Friday. If you have an early pick for MLS and post it on wrong day that will just be messy. You suggest a system that will create a lot of problems. ,SoccerBetting,dg7z9j6,1,t5_2r4wz
