2036653,0,t1_ckygxdh,Hey! Thanks for the cool feedback.Thats not at all a newbie question since it is the thing I had the most trouble with. My project was greatly inspired by this and I spent a long time to figure out how to do it.What I did is to modify the way you map pixel coordinates in the plane. Something you already do usually to transform pixel coordinates  x to something like .I extract the polar coordinates of the point and apply a triangle function to its phase. I keep the same magnitude. You could use any periodic function like sin or cos on the phase but if bends the structure in a way I didnt like. The triangle function kept the proportions.,fractals,ckypc9t,3,t5_2qkrs
2611541,0,t1_cmy9w5f,Hey thats me!  Ive got another WebGL Julia set explorer here  These arent general purpose tools like OP made just one off things to help me discuss particular problems with mathematicians on the internet.  Its hard to convince people to download and run native code but people click any old link without thinking twice.OP Im happy to share my limited knowledge if youre interested in leveraging GPU acceleration in your projects.,fractals,cmzgrqk,2,t5_2qkrs

6296660,0,t1_cz2m7dw,Hello. Ive written a Mandelbrot Set explorer no Julia Set support yet too in SDL and C instead of webGL which means I natively get bit precision which lets me zoom in quite a bit farther. I havent added support for arbitrary precision yet though although ive looked at a number of C libraries that do that.I havent put it up on github yet because I am not satisfied with it enough to have it be publicy accessible but soon enough Im sure Ill make a repo for it.uPegasusEpsilons renderer is command line based and goes straight to PNG on the  CPU as he says. Its pretty awesome but it isnt an explorer no realtime zooming around.,fractals,cz5cxip,1,t5_2qkrs
