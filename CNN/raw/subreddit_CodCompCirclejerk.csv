4613128,0,t3_3e4elk,Its funny because even with how ridiculous it is to make predictions like this. I felt like a lot ended up being true anyways. Like how during ghosts people were saying Clay would be good in AW because of the few people who played it said that it would have viable ARs. Probably just coincidence but funny nonetheless. ,CodCompCirclejerk,ctc2d6n,1,t5_2yas4
