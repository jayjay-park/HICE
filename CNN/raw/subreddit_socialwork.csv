130220,0,t1_cet8h7h,Dont cut yourself short.  Listening is far more important than talking in this field!  I was worried at first being an introvert but honestly I feel like the best clinicians Ive met have been introverts at heart.  We introverts are born people watchers   when were in crowded places we like to observe.  These observational skills make us naturals at getting insight into whats going on with our clients making us all the more able to do our jobs. But it is good youre working on those interpersonal communication skills because dont get me wrong they are important!  We introverts can be great conversationalists when we need to be it just takes more energy for us than it does extroverts so be sure you get your alonequiet time for self care as well.  ,socialwork,cet9edy,2,t5_2rgfg
232502,0,t3_1wrka9,I have my MSW. I took statistics in college hated it but I got through it. I would not change a single thing in my life. I am a strong believer that everything happens for a reason. I like to think my life struggles have made me stronger hence the user name and helps me in the field daily.Some advice however. First and for most is SELF CARE. You have to know your limits and make sure you do things for you when working in the field. It can be very emotionally taxing. Try to leave work at work and not bring it home and always ask for help if needed. A strong social support is essential. The work you do will be rewarding in so many areas to you and your clients. Good luck ,socialwork,cf4uisv,2,t5_2rgfg
249469,0,t1_cf67n1l,I agree with everything said here except for the time frame. I have many friends in private practice who are doing well in far less than  years. By the time you have your lcsw you will have two years internship and  years practice experience plus whatever similar experience you have found in your baccalaureate days. This is enough experience for a clinician to start doing private practice if they choose to. They will continue to get better with time and more experience. Additionally you can also make pretty decent money working in state and government jobs. The pay scale for MSWs doing clinical work in the state of Oregon is kk for many government jobs. Hospital jobs will also produce similar wages. You can however make substantially less. I work for a non profit in Oregon and make less than k but I love what I am doing so it makes up for it for now. ,socialwork,cf6m0x8,1,t5_2rgfg

We also tried a SelfCare Thursday and a debate thread on Tuesdays.  Again effort from mods went into it with not much from the community.  Im willing to try whatever we can certainly do case studies I think thats a great idea.  I hope that the community would step up its involvement.

508315,0,t3_1zxnq3,I was burned out in school.  I was at a top  program but I hated it hated the city hated the papers hated the professors.  I was working full time as well and I hated that job as well.  So what I did was moved back home took a year off focused on relaxing and just worked with EBD kids for some reason I found this relaxing.  Well I reapplied to a different program and much happier now. Here are some signs of burnout.     Every day is a bad day.     Caring about your work or home life seems like a total waste of energy.     Youre exhausted all the time.     The majority of your day is spent on tasks you find either mindnumbingly dull or overwhelming.     You feel like nothing you do makes a difference or is appreciated.Overall I feel that the best way to combat burnout is to reevaluate your goals and priorities.  It sounds like you are doing this by leaving your agency and returning to a MSW program.  Additionally for you I might suggest changing your view on the system.  Yes the system may be broken but you are helping people who are in that system.  You are showing compassion and empathy for many people who are in need.,socialwork,cfy1qy2,5,t5_2rgfg

2870661,0,t3_2syqhw,I am currently placed in a supportive womens housing location. Each has her own apartment and there is  hour staff. The women range from  and all have been homeless at one point. Many have physical health issues and also many have mental health diagnoses such as schizophrenia bipolar etc. So far I am in love with how involved I am with the staff. I do the exact job as the other social support workers and there is such a variety. One day I can be chatting with a client who lost a family member and the next I can be helping a developmentally delayed client clean her room. I can accompany them on outings or plan activities at the home. What I dislike is mainly the unpaid part. Its not the agencys fault but it becomes an extremely long week with placement school and working an actual job. It has definitely prepared me for the field. In this particular setting I act almost like a staff member and I know I would not have learned many of these things just in a class room. I am able to learn from the clients and ways of working with them depending on their needs and I have learned to be more confident just by being there. I certainly had a say in where I was placed. My first field experience was at a seniors drop in centre but I transitioned into their day program to work closer with clients that I would see on a weekly basis. When talking with my teacher I requested a home with either women or children. At first I was nervous to be with this population especially because I am so young. But as I got more comfortable I am able to work with practically all of them. It also helps that many of the staff members are younger as well so I have observed the way they work with the clients and have adapted it into my own style. So far I have no complaints. Other internships might be different but I am placed at a location where you can build on your goals and learn things just by asking. They have been very proactive with supervision and giving me the lead on my experience. I love the ladies I work with and I really hope I can be considered for employment after with this agency. I truly believe in the work that they do and it is going to be hard leaving the clients after I am done  mmonths with  days a week Thats the most nerve wracking part.

Its better to start from a grounded place I want to work with children or I want to be a therapist. Getting your LCSW and going into policy are at opposite ends of the spectrum. I think the question you need to ask yourself is what am I passionate about? Being behind isnt something to worry about. Youre at the relative start of your program. Build relationships explore options. Read a lot look into internships that interest you look on Idealist for example. Your GPA in grad school isnt really a big deal as far as I know everyone is grad school does well. What matters at this point in your life is your drive and passion for social work. Doing a Masters Thesis will be valuable if you want to throw yourself into a subject and theres a good match for you in your program as far as a prof who can guide you. For the record Im an LSW and always knew I was in it to become a psychotherapist. I was singleminded about it and so was able to make the moves and form the relationships I needed to. I was also older and coming from an unrelated field. I was worried that I would be seen as inexperienced but my drive passion and burning desire to learn was always pretty clear and I was able to get the positions I desired from the getgo. ,socialwork,cooatis,11,t5_2rgfg

Im curious what your other practicum was and if it was a better experience. What was your motivation for going into social work to begin with? What was your beginning target population? The good thing about having an MSW is how flexible it is even if the options dont strike you initially. If adult client work isnt doing it for you you could work with kids or older adults or adults in a different setting. You could look into political jobs like working for the government or advocacy for an agency. You could potentially do fundraising or event planning at a nonprofit. You could do corporate social responsibility or HRtype trainings or that sort of thing at a for profit company. You could do macro level community organizing. There are lots of things you can do outside of the traditional clinical route and a lot of them pay better!.

4015770,0,t1_crdv062,I am not sure about hard but I did take a very specific route to working in that area. I never intended to work in that area but happenchanced there. I did my first year MSW placement at a safebed shelter here in Toronto interested in residential social work. Most beds at a safebed shelter  out of  are designed for people with mental health diagnoses and criminal justice involvement. I enjoyed my placement and worked there as a relief worker as I completed my education. After completion I obtained a job in the same agency as a Mental Health and Justice case manager providing case management to people accepted into our Mental Health and Justice housing program again requiring mental health diagnoses and criminal justice involvement. We work on a diversity of issues whether its transitioning from maximum security hospitals NCR to the community housing maintenance or addressing trauma. As you can see getting your foot in at areas related was helpful. I ended up switching to youth mental health given my distrust at the criminal justice system and not wanting to play the role of police in medication compliance etc.In terms of policy that will really depend on the job. I am actually planning to leave the clinical field and return to academia for that reason. Nowadays there seems to be a greater emphasis on efficiency which can sometimes mean job specialization versus a position where you do both. However if you work for a large agency I suppose there will be opportunities to join policy committees. What were you specifically thinking?,socialwork,cre10yo,1,t5_2rgfg

4322524,0,t3_3agp0e,This may be a process as well but have you considered referring out for a personal care aide? A good friend of mine works in a mental health residence and has said that many of their residents require ongoing personal needs care and this is not something staff signed up to do especially on a Masters level. Very often the client will do better with having someone come in for a few hours a day to help them with their personal care needs. They also tend to establish good relationships and trust with their aide.This would be for the longterm though.  Has she also been seen by her psychiatrist? I would clearly bring this to their attention.,socialwork,cscvlf1,1,t5_2rgfg

He just got in the old fashioned way tooapplying online and doing well at the interviews. He didnt know anyone at the college although Im sure that would have helped.

4403250,0,t1_cslw7fh,I think theres a fallacy about the social work vow of poverty that too many people buy into without knowing much about the field.  It sounds like well never make money because were working with the disadvantaged and underprivileged but that takes many forms outside of typical social services. While there are certainly jobs that are on the lowerend of the scale in our field there are also some on the higher end.  Regardless of where you start most will pay a decent salary after a few years.  I mean everyone touts scienceresearch as a field that pays well and thats why I initially went down that road but when I started my career in the field I didnt make over k in my first two positions.  After five years I passed k and it skyrocketed from there until I left at the  year mark but it wasnt exactly the high paying mecca that everyone promised until I became a bit more established.The jobs I was looking at that required an MSW were researchbased and working in militaryveteran family policy and programming.  I did a lot of work with nonprofits and met every other aspect of the positions I was applying for as I had worked with DoD grantscontracts in a research capacity but did not have the MSW.    ,socialwork,cslzbuz,5,t5_2rgfg

4634364,0,t1_ctegx76,I reached out for clarification. I expressed a problem with following that as a rule of thumb no pun intended since it is discriminatory. He said it is the duty of a social worker to support the female full stop. The quote came out during group supervision at a homeless shelter. An American claimed to have been assaulted by her Micronesian nonEnglish speaking spouse. As a result the spouse had been removed from the shelter. No staff was around to see the incident she had no marks none of the staff spoke his language Chuukese and the agency refuses to employ a Chuukese translator despite over half of the clients speaking Chuukese as a first language. I had to speak up because just before the meeting the client approached me and asked to get her husband back in the shelter. I was not her case manager but she felt that her case manager had acted rashly and that the agencys appeal process was broken and unreliable. She then said that she had invented the assault because her case manager had been yelling at her about her work schedule and she wanted a way to distract him. When I pointed out the ethical problems with ejecting someone from a shelter based on one unsubstantiated account that had been recanted the clinical director said the quote. I give you permission in a domestic violence situation to always support the woman. Its almost like he wanted to wipe away the ethical ambiguity with application of ideology. ,socialwork,cteqbbn,9,t5_2rgfg
4731410,0,t3_3fpaf7,To add onto this any kind of case management position especially when its providing a service people didnt sign up for voluntarily....is going to be stressful. Case management often involves managing years of issues and being the scapegoat for problems that you didnt cause and will never be able to solve. Working with adults and family dynamics that have often been out of whack for generations is going to be super stressful.This stuff very often seeps into our work regardless of what population we work with or where we end up professionally. I currently dont work in child protection but my biggest sources of stress at work often have to do with family members.I have a lady who likes to start fires for me.  She is not my client her adult child is.  But she will do things like call up my other clients some who need  hour staff supervision and cant leave my facility...and tell them she is taking them out and buying them lunch.....when I say no it becomes my disaster of the day. She will also feed nonsense into aides and caregivers minds that make it difficult for me to have a positive working relationship with them.We are also often not able to get involved in issues or able to promote change. Boundaries and choosing your battles are huge when it comes to families.Theres a worker on one of my clients teams who gets all fired up because the husband is having an affair.  The client though is not worried about it and we arent there to provide a service to the husband besides helping his wife.  This is also stuff that goes on with families not in care....,socialwork,ctqxpli,2,t5_2rgfg

I typically will always pass on a student who talks a lot about wanting to work with a completely different population and makes a lot of statements like Im just here to do my time until graduation.  I also always look for students who present a good sense of knowing the roots of social work and dont mind doing certain things that suck sometimes.I also look for students who have researched the field and are realistic about career options in social work.Students who have never worked in the field but talk a lot about opening their own private practice as soon as they graduate will always receive a pass from me.Lastly I definitely look for a student who has worked for at least a few years in some kind of capacity.

5291669,0,t3_3nh4va,I adore the professors and their breadth of knowledge. Their perspective as social workers permeates their method of teaching in a very personable way. They are very inspiring people who readily answer sticky questions about ethical dilemmas and how theoretical frameworks translate into practice in interdisciplinary settings.The practicums are well organized and informative and the professors do a great job advocating for the students needs when there is a conflict.I have my frustrations around some of the organizational aspects of the program. There have been requirements around credits and electives that havent been terribly clear. But thats not specific to social work.Some courses have weird evaluation methods. Either they would be better served with more practical skills tests have written finals or they have group projects that are terribly inefficient or the professor has a pet idea that have little relevance to the subject matter.,socialwork,cvo2mdx,3,t5_2rgfg

She said nobody should get a free pass ?!.

I am dearly hoping my field experience is more handson honestly the professor mostly asks us if we read the book and doesnt...I dont know.

5344250,0,t1_cvup8zq,I didnt say that. It is a sticky situation because most people dont tell their employers they are seeking employment elsewhere so Im sure the agency just assumed she would be around the entire practicum period when they brought on two students. I dont blame the supervisor for leaving. I would have sought a job elsewhere too. The agency was irresponsible in many ways. Not having a backup plan for ifwhen their staff supervising the interns left the agency was just another item on a long list. ,socialwork,cvusd3c,2,t5_2rgfg
5344419,0,t1_cvusd3c,Your post reads though my supervisor left knowing full well there was no one else to supervise me.FWIW MOST agencies dont have social workers waiting in the wings in case something like this happens.Ive also worked in places where they dont have students and there is no back up plan for if a staff member leaves....often the work gets given to a different supervisor or split amongst the team.  People can downvote all they want but this is a reality of working in our as well as many fields. I dont want to take away from the OP but as a FI kind of took offense to how your post read initially.I know this is a student heavy board and thats great but most FIs arent paid anymore to take on students.Many of us do it as a way to give back and because we want to help bring good people into the field. I also could easily do my job without students but they tend to be a huge help to me in general. On the flip many places force social workers to take on students they have no say.

5703171,0,t1_cx3vh68,I went there. Pretty much every social worker I know went there.  I also am a field instructor for students from IUPUI fairly regularly. You get what you put into it. Its easy to coast through and equally easy to learn a lot. I had no trouble passing either licensing exam and neither have the vast majority of people I know who went there. When I was there over ten years ago the biggest advantage to different concentrations was that your final practicum is directly related to your concentration. We had enough electives you could be in one concentration and take a few classes in other areas of interest. School concentration was the exception. I dont know if its still the same but I suspect it is. There are certain courses you need to get a school social worker license  some through school of Ed. It is easier to have a school concentration and get another type job than it is to have another concentration and get a job at a school. There are some schoolbased therapy jobs that dont require school concentration but you arent technically the school social worker. There are also some school systems that dont have social workers and instead use school counsellors that also have teaching licenses. Id talk to an advisor before deciding.If you plan to stay in Indiana you can easily get a child welfare job without an MSW or with any concentration. DCS does not pay more to employees with MSW.  It does make it easier to move up the chain. General advice take a serious mental healthaddictions class no matter what your concentration. Not just DSM class. It will help with licensure and every social work job encounters mental health and addiction. Its a nice campus. Indianapolis has more to do than people think. Super liberal professors.

My argument is that by not reporting you are likely allowing future harm to occur and allowing a previous harm to go unaccounted for again punishment can be determined later and can account for the clients circumstances. Both of those seem wrong prima facie. If there is a reason why we should disregard this and instead not report the action an argument needs to be provided. Because something is professional duty i.e. to keep our clients words in confidence does not make it acceptable. There must be a valid reason for doing so.

If someone were to question you about your skills you may not have a lot to stand on. I think it is ok to question your readiness. Shows you want to do a good job. Humility is good.

A lot of the work I do is similar to work I did when I was a community case manager such as helping clients with housing SSI benefits etc.One thing to prepare yourself for is I would say there is a high level of violence on forensic units compared to others lots of people with Antisocial Personality Disorder all in close quarters. I would recommend research in that area for example deescalation techniques. Like others have said you should receive training in how to respond during a physical altercation. The other common issues on my unit are psychosis and drug use K is a big one. Just remember that your social work skills will transfer to this setting.

Didnt matter if they were all singles or siblings I couldnt do over . There is no way you are providing good care at that number because it isnt feasible to do good work. This isnt your fault.

8626157,0,t3_4xxy5n,I dont have direct experience as a member of the Armed Forces American here BUT I did intern the last year of my MSW this past year as a therapist on a military base serving active duty service members. ampnbspLet me tell you I absolutely loved it and its a career path I plan on pursuing once I have my clinical license in a few years which is the minimum requirement for a civilian practitioner with the Department of Defense. There are also options for commissioning like you are describing.ampnbspIn regards to the actual job I was always busy. I had a full caseload and days were spent doing therapy for most if not all of the days. I was often there early or late to finish notes. Whatever your political ideologies are be prepared for there to be extremes on each side especially the more conservative side. ampnbspI say this because I expected it but did not expect how often politics would come up during any interaction. So just being aware of your own beliefs and still being able to do your job in spite of someone elses. ampnbspGet comfortable to profanity if youre not already. This is the only population Ive worked with thus far where using profanity actually helped build rapport. I had quite a few of my patients actually say they were relieved I wasnt afraid to use some of that language otherwise they might not have wanted to open up to me. Im not talking derogatory profanity. But when Im reflecting or reframing some of the things theyre saying Im dropping the same fbomb they used to show I understand the context of their statements.ampnbspA majority of my work was cognitivebehavioralcognitivebehavioral based therapies. Other practitioners also used EMDR pretty frequently. Virtually nobody in the clinic I worked at used anything psychoanlytic. ampnbspLots of trainings and workshops. I got exposed to quite a few new treatment modalities and a lot of good information. The DoD spared no expense getting us the latest and greatest information.ampnbspSome band aid type work. A lot of issues people dont want to deal with at the moment. They just want to get their head straight so their cleared to be deployed again. A lot of people deployed during treatment. Temporary duty assignments for higher ranking officers can be a barrier sometimes. Theres quite a bit of abuse especially in the enlisted ranks in my experience. ampnbspI had a lot of opportunities to work with other professions as I worked in a holistic healthcare model clinic. I got to cotreat with chaplains physical therapists OTs SLPs psychiatrists music therapists art therapists etc etc etc. I loved it. ampnbspThis is all I can think of at the moment. Remember this was my internship experience so it wasnt full time. Im sure other people also had very different experiences. I really enjoyed it. It was hard work and there were a lot of rough days but being able to see the progress really made it all worth it. ampnbspLots of comorbid diagnoses. An overwhelming majority on my caseload were. I worked pretty much only with mood disorders. If I did an assessment and we diagnosed the patient with a personality disorder we sent them to outpatient behavioral health. I worked at a Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic and they were very specific in only taking patients that had mood disorders. So unfortunately my experience is limited in treating people with personality disorders. ampnbspI worked as a part of a huge multidisciplinary team so team meetings at least once a week. At my particular clinic confidentiality was between the client and the clinic which meant I could talk to any provider that the patient saw freely. The patient signed limits of confidentiality forms beforehand and were aware that we could talk to any provider they saw. This actually helped a great deal because it gave me access to other providers notes and sometimes that provider would pop in for one session or I could pop into one of theirs and wed be on the same page from the get go. Extremely valuable. It really has made me a believer in holistic approaches in general. ampnbspOne of the cool things about working with the military was patients from every background different experiences etc etc. Some people were extremely rural and never got healthcare before the military. Some are very urban. I know no two patients are ever the same but really here it was so diverse. I had the opportunity to learn about a lot of different cultures. I really enjoyed that aspect of it. Service members that grew up in Los Angeles or Boston etc were so different from a patient that grew up in rural Alaska the deep south overseas etc. But as the clinician you gotta make sure you adjust and strive for cultural competency though I dont believe true cultural competency exists. Cultural awareness is the term I like to use.ampnbspA good practice in general but really familiarize yourself with medical terminology especially if youre working alongside medical professions when treating. I really didnt know much about medications when I started and it kind of ruined the flow of assessments and therapy sessions if they got put on a new medications and were updating me because I would then have to look up what the medication was for. I got a medical dictionary and just started reading it when I had the time.  ampnbspIf you have any questions feel free to PM me. If I think of anything else Ill add it here. Im sure theres a few things I missed. ampnbspEDIT  Grammar and some more information. ,socialwork,d6jvfhy,8,t5_2rgfg

10157649,0,t3_5kezxb,Hey everyone so I am still debating about which path to take for graduate school but I think social workclinical social workcounseling is in line with my passion. I have a few questions about grad school from what Ive read it seems that the university prestige does not matter that much in terms of finding a job post MSW is that correct? As long as the program is CSWE accreditedIt may be a bit ambitiousoptimistic of me but I view going to graduate school and acquiring the skills to be an effective social workercounselor as a transformative experience. I feel like the knowledge passed on from the professors could vary a lot beyond textbook understanding. Are there any MSW programs that you would recommend based on the wise teachers that make up the programs lecture team?Finally anyone familiar with the MSW program at Humboldt State University?  Their emphasis on working with native americantribal populations and the Altruistic Personality and Prosocial Behavior Institute sounds interesting to me. However I do not know if the universities lack of recognition and the relative isolation would put me at a disadvantage for career advancement and growth. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I look forward to reading any and all replies!,socialwork,dbvfcht,1,t5_2rgfg
10172134,0,t3_5lnrun,The first practicing I adjusted my hours at work to work later one day a week and longer on the other days and did my practicum shifts on a Thursday and Sunday.  For the second practicum at the same location I changed it to FridaySunday and dropped down to four days at my job. I had a hospital placement so that gave me some flexibility for working on a weekend. The reality is that a lot of students in my cohort ended up quitting their jobs because they couldnt make the schedule work. Your school isnt lying in that the opportunities for after hour practicum are very limited. One way that people got around it was doing a workplace practicum.,socialwork,dbx2frc,3,t5_2rgfg
10185908,0,t1_dbwgp4t,Youre going to hear both go right away and take some time off from everyone and they both can be rightwrong.  What you really need to do is what you think would be best for you.  A MSW is very intense and some people are so burned out on school that they either do very poorly in it or they end up hating the work they are doing.  Since you are saying that you think you will need some time off I recommend you take a year or two off. Assuming you are in your s there really is no rush to complete your MSW.,socialwork,dbymngm,1,t5_2rgfg
10192704,0,t3_5lxwn5,I see what youre saying but there are a couple of issues with that idea in my opinion. As someone who didnt get their bachelors in social work if I decided I want to get my social work degree but only had the option of getting a bachelors again I would probably end up choosing a different career path since I dont want to go back to school for four more years and take all those gen eds again. Also since I had a bachelors in a related field which I feel like is often the case for people looking to get their masters anyway the course work wasnt much different in undergrad and I was able to take a break from school and get a job in the social work field. Im now getting my MSW but I would argue I have much more experience than someone working on their BSW because of those couple of years of employment. I wouldnt have been able to get that job if I hadnt had a bachelors degree in something ya know? ,socialwork,dbzedtw,7,t5_2rgfg
10198718,0,t3_5lxwn5,I would actually argue that although a BSW is certainly a valuable degree with plenty of applicability and can prepare a student well for an MSW one of the positives I see in my MSW program is the diversity of experience coming into the program. People have completed their undergraduate education in psychology sociology anthropology education studies...since theres no required undergraduate degree there ends up being a much more diverse wealth of knowledge in each classroom which I feel is incredibly valuable to my education. To require a BSW in order to complete an MSW would be limiting and I feel would harm the field by hyperfocusing the knowledge base to the point that fewer new ideas and viewpoints enter the academic sphere. In a field where increasing professionalization and standardization is already a point of contention I cant imagine that creating a set required path would be helpful.That and many people come to social work after already experiencing a good bit of education. Why should we force people to know in undergrad exactly what they want to do? That seems like a recipe for disaster resulting in people who think they want to enter this very demanding field and sink money time and energy into it before having the experience to be sure. If anything I would support a requirement for work experience as someone else mentioned regardless of undergraduate degree and I believe this is an unofficial requirement of almost all programs as those with experience are given preference during the admissions process. ,socialwork,dc02y1l,4,t5_2rgfg

10527078,0,t3_5qpoo8,Im a behavioral health consultant in a primary care clinic for uninsured and underinsured population. I work really closely with medical providers to identify patients who have either mental health needs or behavioral aspects to chronic disease med compliance diet compliance with diabetes etc. I then see the patients when they come in to see their primary care physician and do brief psychoeducation and behavioral interventions using a mix of MI DBT ACT and other behavior therapy skills. I also do assessments for our consultative psychiatry where I get a full mental health and med history review with PCP consult with psychiatrist and report back to PCP who prescribes meds. I see anywhere from  patientsday for  min visits and its mostly not scheduled ahead of time. So every day is different!Integrated behavioral health in primary care is relatively new and our psychiatry model even newer so theres a lot of research and admin stuff that I work on to evaluate and improve quality of care.I love what I do. Ive never been interested in traditional medical social work too much discharge planning for me and doing traditional therapy all day was pretty draining for me.

10648471,0,t3_5ryaud,I have ADHD and anxiety. I work in mental health so the cancellationssuicide riskschanging needs are pretty significant parts of my day. Ive found that its really important for me to set boundaries and realistic expectations with clients that has been the primary thing that has helped me with time management. I cant be everything to everyone I just need to do my job. Some things Ive found help me with time management are   I schedule my appointments for three set times a day and I also schedule in admin time first thing in the morning and my lunch break otherwise I shove everything into a day and dont leave travel time etc. My clients all know that they can see me at am pm or pm unless there are special circumstances. I also schedule as many regular times with people as possible to keep my diary under control. Also having different colours for different types of meetings phone calls etc helps.   I also have a to do list on my desk. Its laminated so I can use texta on it to rub out things Ive done. It has three sections priority before next appointment and ideasfollow up.  I also have different tables to remind what assessments I need to get done what I need to do for groups and networking. I need to have a separate list for things so that I can compartmentalise.  I also get in trouble for being a few minutes late frequently. I dont have any pearls of wisdom with that yet. Ive managed to start getting to work on time this year by pushing the time I leave back to  minutes earlier than I think things are going to take I live  minutes from my office. Im also trialing having an alarm to go off when I need to leave for if I get distracted.I can also really relate to what you say about notes I cant do SOAP notes. Its not the way my brain functions. my manager knows that and weve come to accept that I write my notes it a narrative form which ends up covering all the info required for SOAP. but I have to keep in brief and to the point. I found that trying to do it in another way to the way my brain functions meant that I did a lot of procrastinating and putting off because it was too overwhelming to try and focus the information into little boxes that didnt make sense to me. I think getting my note style came with experience as well. I would also spend a lot of time trying to get in every detail now three years in I know whats important to include in the note. I think you need to have an open honest conversation with your supervisor about your needs as a student and how you are feeling in the placement. You are still learning and its her to provide a safe learningworking environment. This isnt all on you.It sounds to me like a major thing thats needed here is communication with your supervisor.

Ive been connecting patients with other social resources as they come but being a small community outside resources are also limited. My boss is a nurse and doesnt know what to ask of me. Its been established that the doctors will continue to do the suicide assessments and child abuse assessments. We use outside agencies for mental health and substance abuse and she is hesitant to pull away from that as having them perform the assessment gets them into treatment faster.

11130038,0,t3_5yujq9,. Yes! Hello fellow Bipolar  social work student here.  Also with anxiety and PTSD but mostly the bipolar depression is what will eff my day up. You know your health better than anyone what you can handle and your own coping mechanisms. I coped by taking my meds getting a therapist doing deep breathing and engaging with quilting and cross stitching which have been relaxing ways to get my mind off of school and internship self care!. My advice? Stay on stop of your symptoms! If you notice yourself slipping into depression or mania get help ASAP!! School is stressful some internships can be very stressful the two together can be overwhelming. Whether it be marijuana a counselor or talking to trusted faculty at your school to facilitate accommodations get help and take care of yourself because no one else can or will. . I would not tell my supervisor about the diagnosis or your treatment period unless it is absolutely necessary and unavoidable e.g. need a leave of absence due to symptoms. I say this because there really is a stigma and you may be treated differently in subtle or notsosubtle ways when it is really unwarranted. I take prescription drugs to control my mental health symptoms and feel that my mental health and how I treat it is between me and my doctor. If my symptoms are not interfering with placement I absolutely keep it separate from placement. The only time I have disclosed is when I found out an employee at the county mental health clinic I am interning with is doing a presentation to the clinical staff on bipolar disorder. I spoke with him asking him to make clear that mania is not like a cup of coffee. One of the clinicians in this mental health agency mentioned she wished she could have mania so she could have more energy to get her work done! Huge misunderstanding of what it is! You may deal with this kind of ignorance how you deal with that is your call. He disclosed in return that he has bipolar  as well! So we absolutely can make it in this field graduate and be successful. . I wouldnt especially as you are off of the marijuana for now. Ive interned in a county agency and in a hospital and neither drug tested some placements may it seems like they usually dont but if youve been off the pot for some time it doesnt seem like it would benefit any party to bring it up.Im happy to answer any other questions either here or via pm.

11450195,0,t3_63ewig,Baltimore social worker here and I lived in the neighborhood I worked in both MSW years.To be honest I dont think it makes a super difference because the internship is less than a year and the old guideline is that community organizing requires a year of ground work first. Yes you can get a better sense of things faster but you still need to be putting yourself out there and meeting people which you would be doing regardless if you lived in the neighborhood or not.So I think whether its a good or bad idea is really up to you and your preferences. You are on more often like you cant stop to grab a drink without seeing somebody and talking about a neighborhood issue. I know people who love being able to leave the office and actually commute somewhere else and be off the rest of the night. My supervisor until this past Friday has been organizing in her neighborhood for like seven years and its created really deep strong bonds between her and neighbors but she also acknowledges she is bad at maintaining those boundaries and keeping that balance.But If you set good boundaries and you can seek out assistance with your supervisors and advisers about this this can help maintain worklife balance. Being upfront with telling people After pm pm lbr I will not answer the phone. Please leave me a text voice message or email and I will get back to you asap. Hear about a new concern from a neighbor while walking the dog and speak briefly on it but ask them to call you during your work hours to set up a meeting to go deeper into it. All the evening and weekend meetings are also more convenient when you can roll out of bed and walk over in five minutes.,socialwork,dftvc90,4,t5_2rgfg
