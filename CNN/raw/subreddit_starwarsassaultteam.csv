In order to get  lvl  crates not only do you need to wait an entire week you also need to spend  energy.To get a full house you can do it in a single day usually with an expenditure of about  in case you get crappy ll training items during the lvl  runs.A full house gets you  xp a  of a kind gets you . So it is more efficient to go for a full house on the days that match your characters affinity.numbers taken from the stuff for guys blogspot which is a surprisingly deep resource for a free ios game,starwarsassaultteam,cipj7jd,2,t5_3147o
