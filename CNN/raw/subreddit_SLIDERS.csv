1281083,0,t1_cidp2xt,Well I cant take full credit for it. Various SLIDERS fans on the old SciFi Bboard over the years proposed a SLIDERS reboot where the original cast would reprise their roles but as older doubles with the story starting at a later point with a Quinn who is older when he discovers sliding. It was clearly an effective way to get SLIDERS back to basics while acknowledging the older cast.Temporal Flux a very prominent figure in SLIDERS fandom once suggested that FOX mismarketed SLIDERS and the ad copy should have highlighted the characters and offered his own take on how FOX could have advertised the show Wade Welles is a dreamer who failed to find direction in life. Rembrandt Brown is a soul singer who failed to hang on to his  minutes of fame. Professor Arturo is a scientific genius who failed to achieve recognition for his brilliance. And Quinn Mallory is a college student who just failed to discover antigravity  but he discovered something else instead...  I just updated that to where the characters might have been in  continuing with the theme that all the characters had failed at something.If SLIDERS were to return as a new show however I think the best bet would be recasting. As I said Sabrina has left fulltime acting and while John RhysDavies is a delight I would not submit that poor man to bungee jumping and running from security guards at this point in his life. But I also wouldnt want SLIDERS with new characters I think what made the show special was the character combination of an adventurous geekboy a repressed hippychick a selfdelusional famechaser with a heart of gold and an arrogant academic whose insecurity masked great nobility and wisdom. You can always find new actors to capture the essences of Quinn Wade Rembrandt and Arturo.Jackson Davis played an athletic geekboy on LONELYGIRL and Gregory Smith has played a lot of awkward geeks. Allison Scagliotti and Phoebe Tonkin are good at playing spunky mischief. Levar Burton and Colin Salmon have great screen presence and could capture Rembrandts big heart beautifully  they might have to fake the singing. And I think John Hurt would be good at playing a bombastic ass who is deep down a man of great character and kindness.A show that doesnt feature the characters of Quinn Wade Rembrandt and Arturo might as well just be a different show about parallel universes with a different title.I was kind of thinking of how CONTINUUM is clearly a low to middle budgeted show shot in Vancouver and features a lot of people on location having intense conversations and SLIDERS would work well on that kind of scale. I think that would be the right place for the show.If there ever is a revival with Jerry Sabrina Cleavant and John I think it would probably be a small viewondemand project aimed strictly at the fans and done on an indiemovie budget scale. Maybe itd be my soft reboot suggestion or maybe itd be set after the events of The Seer with some extremely vague reference to how all the characters are alive and well again.,SLIDERS,cidqlyy,3,t5_2t33z
5664125,0,t3_3s09vh,My favorite world!  I would change nothing.I dont think we needed to revist the world again int eh series.I think the politics would be more intellectual.  Rather than vague and ambiguous concepts being used as rhetoric to stir voter interest there would be more substantive policy debates.,SLIDERS,cwz6uf2,2,t5_2t33z
6215191,0,t1_cyw3fej,No argument from me on that. I thought the first two seasons did a good job staying faithful to the premise of alternate worlds but FOX decided it wanted Monster of the Week episodes and forced SLIDERS writers to come up with moviebased parodies that didnt serve to further the gangs attempts to return to Earth Prime. But for me what really sent the show off the rails was killing off Arturo. I know that was because of difficulties behind the scenes but FOX really is to blame for getting John RhysDavies so upset about the direction of the show and how the scripts turned out. If SLIDERS had been on a different network when it started it would have been completely different but I bet it wouldve been better and stayed on the alternateworlds theme better.,SLIDERS,cyw3mg5,2,t5_2t33z
6284886,0,t1_cz3nlkq,Glad to discuss these ideas. Im happy you posted this subject!I agree it wouldve been a good storyline to use but as with the rest of the series things didnt go according to plan. Unfortunately.,SLIDERS,cz40r80,1,t5_2t33z

8160298,0,t1_d4tagnj,Not doing a full transcription but he basically said slider had massive amounts of potential but it was wasted by having untalented derivative writers.  His last line on it was you cant always turn a sows ear into a silk purse.When she asked and about which professor said he says who cares? Who cares? I didnt at that point.,SLIDERS,d4xl2u8,1,t5_2t33z
8161946,0,t1_d4xkz9m,Eh thats when FOX really started meddling. They cut short season  just to gain more control over what became season . Then season  new show runner and Torme lost all control.,SLIDERS,d4xshoc,1,t5_2t33z
