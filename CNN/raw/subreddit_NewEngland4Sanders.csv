I hope to bring  people up from CT Saturday but definitely stop by the Springfield office this weekend if youre in the area and available. Shifts start at noon this is what I was told...dunno why it differs from the link below.Signup link here ,NewEngland4Sanders,czx98ol,2,t5_39dgc

While we all want Bernie you guys have the chance to help out someone who could better serve our country than the current frontrunners.Just an opinion! Dont heed it if you dont want to! FeelTheBern and have a good day!,NewEngland4Sanders,czxkz68,8,t5_39dgc
