4303442,0,t3_3a7wtu,Im aware of the Ustream feed being awful.  Its completely out of my hands.  Im sending such a low audio level but the meters are pinned to the red on Ustreams end for no apparent reason.  Download the show for better audio quality.  Sorry for any inconvenience.  Cheers!!,DaveyMac,csaq111,3,t5_2x5nv
