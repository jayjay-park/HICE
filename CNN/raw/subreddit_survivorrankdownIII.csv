7282971,0,t3_4eqxfg,What are you guys thought on a completely irrelevant finalist with a strange spelling of a regular name making the top  because that could be a legitimate possibility. ,survivorrankdownIII,d260xd9,3,t5_3ao82
7298900,0,t3_4eqxfg,I have opinions on characters that is way different from most people on here and its not really because I value strategy more. Its more because I dont mind people being an airtime hog I have Samoa Russell Hantz as probably a top  character.Unpopular opinion Spencer was the top character in Cambodia.It was a growth arc that just suddenly fell flat out of nowhere which a lot of you say is bad but I think its a clever Sixth Sense like twist that was really important to the story of the season.Spencer came out saying he was going to do a better job making connections and the edit showed him attempting to do that and him continually commenting on his attempts. But despite that we never actually see it working until the end of the season. He spent the entire premerge on the bottom.Then we get to the merge and we see the result of the connections he made hes a swing vote and has some level of relationship with everyone on the island. Perfect hes got this. He now has the freedom to use those connections to make the moves to dictate the end game.Except he didnt make those bonds the right way. He didnt realize how he was connecting with people on a deep personal level which was the only way he could think to do it. He built the connections on personal bonds confiding important things about his personal life and really making himself into a close friend and confidant of the people he was working with. So now when he goes to make the moves hes deeply betraying their trust and hurting them and losing the votes like Stephen Fishbach and Kelley Wentworth and even Kass and others who he worked so hard to build himself with to put in a position in the game.And its such a contrast from what Jeremy did because Jeremy also built up social bonds but he did so from more of a distance. He got to know everyone he got people to want to work with them but he never committed to the betrayed jury members in the same way Spencer did. And the ones he did commit to Stephen for example he never turned against and had them as a shield so the opposition would target them instead of him. Spencer committed to personal relationships but he committed too much and when he broke them suddenly that friendship he created seems very fake to everyone. He not only loses the game he loses the relationships he built on the island and people who were his friends no longer even like him. Jeremy keeps his distance and wins the respect of everyone.I love that story. That and not the blindsides and idols and sometimes incomprehesibly complex strategy is why Cambodia is on the fringes of my top . Its stories like these and contrasts like these that make Survivor such good television for me.And yes if you do have me in the final four writeup role Spencer is going to come up in the Cambodia section even though I know hes going to be nowhere close to the top  in that season. And no Im not just a Spencer fanboy Cagayan Spencer deserves to be in the  range that hes probably going to end up.,survivorrankdownIII,d27u2wz,3,t5_3ao82

8843152,0,t3_5174x7,. Ken Stafford Survivor Thailand th placeSook Jai is one of the more boring tribes of the first few seasons. Outside of Robbs explosiveness and Shii Ann being a cockroach the tribe generally consists of scenes of bland nice herotype people being vaguely pleasant. Ken is perhaps the poster child for this.He was cast as the big hero as the NYC cop in the wake of  and that led to some interesting things early on with him getting a huge round of applause when introducing himself. Outside of that he had a pretty interesting relationship with Robb  weve had plenty of bromances throughout  seasons of Survivor but this one is unique in that there are very defined roles within it  the older mature brother and younger immature one who learns from the older one. Ken is probably most memorable for his jury speech where in one of the more infamous examples of the full story not being explained on TV he says that Brian told him that Ted had to go right after the merge and he wants Brian to reveal the reason why Ted had to go. Brian doesnt tell him what he wants to hear and hes seemingly very irritated. Later it comes out the reason that Brian said that Ted had to go was because they couldnt let them have two black winners in a row and Brian assumed that Ken must be racist since hes a NYC cop. Its one of the most Brian Heidik things ever and is pretty hilarious in a bizarre fucked up way but ultimately it has little to do with Ken himself.Out of that there really isnt a whole lot to say about Ken. He was a strong male booted at the merge for being in the minority and being a physical threat. He had a fun relationship with Robb and a memorable jury speech that was mainly memorable because of offscreen stuff. The end.Also fun fact Ken describes his perfect day as September  . So thats something. I was going to make this nomination a while ago but then I reread some stuff on him from SR that reminded me of some hilarious storylines involving bananas that I had forgotten so I put him off a little longer.

9906561,0,t3_5gw351,. Kelly Wiglesworth Borneo nd PlaceIt shouldnt be a surprise that I would be the first person to cut a person in Borneos jury phase.  I dont adore the season like most people particularly rank down people do though its still in my top half.  Kelly is actually fairly representative of why I dont adore Borneos end game but well get to that later.I certainly think that Kelly is better than the premerge Tagis on virtue of her ability to be a key figure in multiple storylines.  As mentioned before shes solid in the Dirk has a crush on Kelly story.  Overall though Kelly is fairly UTR in the premerge.In the postmerge Kelly explodes and takes on a ton of roles.  Throughout the postmerge she is the villainous alliance member the alliance member with a soul the one person who is thinking about flipping the alliance member the other members want to take out immunity beast last hope for a good guy win underdog less charismatic loser and ultimately betrayer.  Im not sure any character in the history of the show has donned as many hats as Kelly did in the postmerge section of Borneo.Kelly deserves a significant amount of credit for keeping the postmerge somewhat interesting with her uncertainty in the alliance.  I think it was uToddSolondz who mentioned that while the Survivor fandom uses Pagonging as a negative term the actual Pagonging was pretty interesting.  Kelly deserves all of the credit for that.  The main reason the Pagongings in CI RI and SoPa were so uninteresting was because there was never a real chance that anyone was going to flip.  Kelly was seriously considering flipping over to the Pagongs until F when it wouldnt have mattered.  Even on a rewatch Kellys moral dilemma is fascinating to watch while most will they wont they flip teases suffer heavily on a rewatch.Kellys Immunity streak is super cool to watch and I would say its the most exciting Immunity run ever.  One of my favorite scenes in the entire Borneo postmerge is at the F Immunity challenge.  Rich falls out fairly early and talks about his awesome plan to betray Kelly.  Kelly then throws his plan out the window by winning immunity then and for the rest of the game Kelly cant be voted out.  Kelly is also singlehandedly responsible for Snakes and Rats the greatest jury speech there ever was and ever will be.  Ill admit that Kellys betrayal of Sue didnt hit me that hard when I watched it for the first time but after knowing about Snakes and Rats it hit a lot harder.  Kelly is really the perfect first runnerup in Survivor history who lost to the perfect first winner in Survivor history.The character I described seems like a lock for top  so it may be confusing that Im cutting Kelly here.  The fact is that for all of Kellys importance to the season she really doesnt have a ton of charisma.  I really cant get over this fact and while I admit that its a weak reason to dislike a character the fact is that I dont find Kelly all that compelling on screen and that really lowers her value as a character.  Shes a dreary speaker shes not especially emotive when she talks or reacts and she doesnt do that much to draw a viewer in.  I value screen presence quite a bit and I can never view someone like Kelly who doesnt have much screen presence as a toptier character.  Still I think shes totally deserving of a spot in the top  of any rank down and I can see why some may put her higher due to her historical importance and contribution to awesome moments.I nominate Rodger Bingham.  I think hes fairly onedimensional and while I like him his time has run out.ureposado your pool is Rodger James Penner . Siska Natalie Brenda . and Ozzy ..,survivorrankdownIII,dayujoo,8,t5_3ao82

And I dont think you will listen to me because you dont like that I agreed to protect Sophie. I hope you will listen to somebody else.,survivorrankdownIII,dcu023t,2,t5_3ao82
10462343,0,t1_dcu0f1b,Doesnt tell me anything. Anything changed would be highlighted in purple and Kass is not. I also see no proof of the deal being made in the first place. Only the nomcut plans list has any highlights at all everything else is prior updates. ,survivorrankdownIII,dcu0hdc,3,t5_3ao82
10472871,0,t1_dcv7faw,ujacare has a pool of Jerri Rupert Cirie Richard Kathy Eliza and Courtney .. He is cut  because Tyson was  James was  Kass was  idoled Denise was  and Sue is now .Im gonna take a small break. Ill be back in a day or two. Fulfilled my deals Didnt break any deals in the end and I hope by jumping off this pole I can at least win back repo and Jlims friendship. Im sorry you guys ,survivorrankdownIII,dcv7hvz,4,t5_3ao82
10477333,0,t1_dcv7dbn,gtbut I just hope uramskick  and uFunsized  to still honour their Sophie deals because despite the accusations people made     so now that this is in the past did fun have a sophie endgame deal?    because last i talked to him he wasnt sure and i do believe he actually doesnt know.      gtUltimately repo broke a deal or at least a perceived deal     perceived deal is the main issue. jlim i think maybe it was jacare will attest that i said for some reason ofr thinks i have a kass endgame deal. i still cant figure out why you thought that because i remember our kass deal to  very specifically as i made only two endgame deals nat a and sandra  before we reached about when i took an ian deal      gtand I want to win back my integrity even if I have to cut somebody whom I like.    if you really wanted sue in endgame you would have included her in the endgame plan you proposed. yeah one of your points was to have no seasons overrepresented at which point i said that rich was a given for me. but either way you haven no license to act like the sue defender. you never even suggested her for endgame.     ,survivorrankdownIII,dcvpq3y,3,t5_3ao82
10481364,0,t1_dcvb5tw,Yes but at that point there were people I really wanted to cut in that pool so I said wait off a round not expecting anything huge to change which was wrong. ,survivorrankdownIII,dcw65vg,1,t5_3ao82

10928851,0,t1_de6cxsi,ok. Im going to use this chart as a way to respond to uOddfictionrambles. Its been a while since the rankdown. I do believe I got outplayed at times and your pushing of certain people early on caused me to completely forget about Trish not intentional from you but good for you I guess Thats probably the biggest thing early on I would do differently rankdown wise is WC Trish right after  passed. The other thing is getting a plan together faster not making deals from Brandon Quinton... knowing who my targets were. I think aligning with you was a positive until about  which I realized. Looking at my cutsnoms you had surprisingly little input that I can remember on most of them. I think it was just a lot of dont do this pick another choice. Anyways this chart shows a lot of the trends I guess and people affected by it. Looking at the chart youre responsible for a lot of the major swings. Out of the  most dropped people I think you were a part of all except Shambo. lots of premergers plus some like Deena and Rory With gains less so but about  of the top  was from you but looking at the more moderate increases it wasnt really you as often as people think. You made the big obvious moves like Kim Parvati Wentworth but didnt have any more effect on the smaller increasesdecreases than anyone else did. I mean going through each mostleast person by ranker you by far have the most but this chart like I said above shows the biggest jumps which you did have a lot of say in.Repo Rich .
