Given the information Both participants headed in the same direction cabbie had suspended license accident happened at a high enough speed to kill no mention of wrongdoing on the cyclists part its a disappointment to see a fellow cyclist default to victim blaming.

1983418,0,t3_2hcjh4,LThere are bicyclists  Citibikers and traditional cyclists of which I am both pedestrians and automobile drivers... Unless you do all three in densely populated city it is sometimes hard to have proper perspective on each.Regardless of how you travel you should always respect those around you and travel defensively.  Everyone breaks the law and others will continue to do so.  Individuals should continue to abide by their own personal code which should include following the law to minimize incidents and keep order.  I dont think you can blame one group or another just try to be more cognizant of your surroundings.  My biggest petpeeve are bicyclists who salmon.  Since bicycling is a step down for lack of better words from driving and doesnt require a license I feel that many pedestriansturnedbicyclists are unaware of proper etiquette which is really the law! as they dont normally drive and thus dont understand that they are basically driving a vehicle now.  Something needs to be done to push more awareness before someone gets on a bike... perhaps requiring a type of license certification etc... or a more pronounced bike police force to stop those riding the wrong way down the street. Also its the law to have a bellringer on your bike.  Many bicyclists dont have these or use them.  If I were driving a car I would make aware of my presence to those walking against the traffic light by using my horn... proper use of a bellringer gets people out of the way fairly effectively.  Youll always have those earbudders who cant even hear the high pitches of the bell however that will probably never change and you should still do your best to make people aware of your presence If police cant enforce the law the city should at least create a campaign that makes everyone aware of bicycling laws... have signs that say wrong way in troublesome areas or have volunteers in bright yellow shirts hold signs and give out brochures to those bicycling.  I saw a video of police handing outinstalling bike ringers on the Brooklyn side of the Manhattan bridge... what a great way to send awareness  give out something free and provide information on the laws bicycling.Central park is a special case where bicyclists would like to enjoy an uninterrupted ride without automobiles.... pedestrians will always be in the way in some capacity but cyclists should still obey the law.Everyone in NYC jaywalks runs red lights drives too quickly etc.... we all need to do our part to reduce how aggressive we walk ride or drive.,NYCbike,cks7aq4,3,t5_2sfmo

You can adjust it yourself see any youtube video such as this one  You generally do not need to adjust your derailleur unless you displace the cogs by either reseating them or changing wheels.Finally if youre not able to adjust it such that it shifts smoothly as before you should take it to your LBS and ask them if they can inspect it and also teach you how to adjust it if you werent certain how after watching the video.

NYPD is required to respond in some way to relevant  complaints how effective that response is tends to be completely variable and is what the modern cynic might expect from a police response to a complaint made through an app. It does however work often enough to make a quick complaint through the app worthwhile.

10118313,0,t3_5knrvv,These are great the top right and should be used at intersections with twoway streets. For Manhattans protected bicycle lanes on oneway avenues however its more challenging.The city wants to maintain the turn bays in order to keep the primary automotive lanes clear. So the big issue is the mixing zone.  Since Many drivers do not yield to bicyclists in these zones it would be better to just run a split phase on every intersection and extend the bicycle lane along the sidewalk with flex post to keep the drivers from blocking. You could extend the bicycle lane without eliminating auto space by reducing the size of the buffer between the moving and turning lanes for autos.,NYCbike,dbqf9nr,1,t5_2sfmo

10609918,0,t1_dda7s7x,Im putting on my downvote suit but maybe theres concern not so much for the cyclist hitting people but potentially being hit by drivers who have the right of way? I mean quite frankly pedestrians are a larger problem than rats and pigeons theyll jaywalk anywhere so intersections are the least of anyones concerns.I mean no matter how you look it or try to look at it its breaking the law. Whether its because of quotaseasy money or whathaveyou the easiest way to not get caught is to not commit the crime to begin with? Just saying.Just the other day I encountered a cyclist going full speed on the sidewalk. There are countless cyclists running red lights riding in the wrong direction etc. Lets not pretend people on bikes are somehow invulnerable.Drivers complain about pedestrians and cyclists cyclists complain about drivers and pedestrians pedestrians complain about drivers and cyclists. None of these three things are mutually exclusive. I regularly rotate between the three. The issue isnt with the laws or how theyre enforced the issue is with the people who somehow think theyre entitled to special treatment because they know better than everyone else and fortunately for them they wont have to be the ones to do the cleanup.Speed Cars gt Bikes gt PedestriansManeuverability Cars lt Bikes lt Pedestrians,NYCbike,ddabyna,2,t5_2sfmo
