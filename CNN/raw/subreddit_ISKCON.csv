8251700,0,t3_4s7xx9,gt Sometimes he becomes a great hero  just like Hiranyakasipu and Kamsa or in the modern age Napoleon or Hitler. The activities of such men are certainly very great. See VedaBase.netYou understood wrong  Hiranyakasipu was a great demoniac person. So Prabhupada is describing Hitler in the same way. Hes not prasing him.This is what Prabhupada says about Hitler also Regarding Hitler so Hitler may be good man or bad man so what does he help to our Krishna Consciousness movement? But it is a fact that much propaganda was made against him that much I know and the Britishers are firstclass propagandists. And I have heard that his officers did everything without informing him just like in our ISKCON there are so many false things Prabhupada said this Prabhupada said that. But we have nothing to do with Hitler in our Krishna Consciousness. Do not be deviated by such ideas Jnanam jneyam jnanagamyam ibid Krishna is knowledge He is the object of knowledge He is the goal of knowledge andyou mam evam asammudhojanati purusottamamsa sarvavid bhajati mamBg. XV Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead without doubting is to be understood as the knower of everything and he engages himself therefore in devotional servicethis is the understanding of advanced devotee so my best advice to you is to agree to come to this understanding.Theres material knowledge and spiritual knowledge. Prabhupada was someone who came to teach about spiritual knowledge first and formost. Spiritual knowledge is real knowledge and an eternal truth  material knowledge isnt. He didnt care about Hitler as he has nothing to do with what he was preaching.If you want mundane knowledge you can go elsewhere. We go to Prabhupada for spiritual knowledge and his journey on preaching Krishna Consciousness was nothing short of a miracle  you just have to read his pastimes and biography. You will understand the real Srila Prabhupada.Some other quotesgt Of course its a fact that history has been written by the victors and people like Hitler have naturally been vilified to the extreme. Big demons like Churchill on the other hand have been glorified in the eyes of the westerners. From Srila Prabhupadas point of view however Churchill himself was a demon who starved hundreds of thousands of Indians in order to have them join the army during WWII. This was very demoniac activity and there were many other atrocities committed by the Allies that are not set down in the history books. Hitlers application of eugenics in terms of eliminating millions of people in concentration camps is a completely demoniac activity. Of course Stalin who was an ally during WWII killed far more people than even Hitler using similar techniques.gt So the way the material world operates is clearly presented in the Vedas. There are stories about millions of people dying in battles between the demons and the devotes such as on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. It shouldnt come as any surprise that Srila Prabhupada has a different view of such things than our conditioned or collective historical perspective here in the West. As someone else says in regards to caste system gt For eons and established by ancient texts Indias caste system ordered society. Each caste related to a part of the body and like a head hand or heart performed its functions and was appreciated for the role they played in the orderly operation of the body. Just as there is no judgement on the hand or the feet because their function is not thinking the castes were not originally created to be indicative of superiority or inferiority. Prabhupad being a scholar and a fundamentalist would of course feel the separation of castes to be proper. As far as the judgmental remarks he purportedly made i see no reason to slander a saint.gt Prabhupada were not a racist he was a spiritualist he never identified anyone with their gross body he only saw the soul so how could he be racist?,ISKCON,d590o62,2,t5_2uw9x
