2812153,0,t1_cnndvbs,Thank you for taking the time out to really reply in depth.First I am glad I can provide the laugh P. Yes I have heard its newly wednearly dead out there with the seniors being the ruling majority in Nanaimo. I read up on the mills actually I read Nanaimo news nearly every day so as to keep a finger on its pulse very sorry to hear about the mass loss of jobs when that went down the drain ... I can see myself grabbing something in tourismhospitality  easily seeing as I do have a good chunk of customer servicerestaurant experience to fall back on. Good point on the boomerang kids  the bf and his best friend are both from the island and are wanting the lifestyle back and I am sick and tired of the concrete jungle of corporate alberta. Its as I mentioned in a reply somehwere here  I was told that people live on the island for the island life Seeretirees how they go about making the living isnt so much judged as it can be rough for anyone going out there. Its the lifestyle that they are seeking. Me? Im just aiming high  Ill work my way up if needed  wait for a govt posting or something up my alley... Until those opportunities come along Ill take we. I fell in love with Nanaimo for various reasons and I wont let retail bring me down lol.Ill be cashing out a good k to bring out as my personal golden egg. If the man finds a job before I do which is  likely this will give me a bit of time to adjust to island time and find a job. We may end up landing in Vic but were aiming for Nanaimo due to family.Excellent point on the employers being keenly aware that they can get anyone else who is willing to take the .hr and be over the moon for it. This is something I will not soon forget!Were not too worried about housing as we may look into buying with some help from my golden eggother savings  but thats too far in the future and we have professional guidance on that. Youre right it is scenic and I want it... Just have to be prepared to pick up a mop and bucket for it if necessary .,nanaimo,cnnqf53,2,t5_2rokp

Will Nanaimo commit to creating tourism infrastructure?  Will we see incentives for tech companies to headquarter in Nanaimo?  Or will we simply become a retirement community where a hour care aide job is seen as success?,nanaimo,cynnt0f,6,t5_2rokp

7897250,0,t1_d43czac,I feel like everyone is painting too nice of a picture. I think this is quite accurate. It depends on the person and your circumstances. We obviously dont know OPs other offers or even current position so Nanaimo may be the best choice but in no way would I say Nanaimo perfectly satisfied any of OPs concerns. The bus can be awful for some areas and if you plan to just go to the bar and make new friends I wish you luck. But if you find a nice place near work or both work and home is on a single bus route and the bus goes both ways by both locations and search out likeminded people it can be satisfy OPs concerns. ,nanaimo,d43q37s,10,t5_2rokp
7925556,0,t1_d45r7s2,Well Im kind of curious about my chances of being accepted for PWD based on mental illness depression. Ive heard its really difficult to get your application accepted even if youre blind or missing a limb or something... much less if you have a mental illness which isnt clearly visible like that.Im not sure if you would know anything about that or have any advice. But besides hopefully being treated Id like to apply for the PWD status. Im hoping they will take me seriously and not just decide Im some kind of lousy moocher. Ive heard some horror stories about our mental health care system mostly that it isnt very good or that the people who are supposed to help you get better will just make you more messed up but hopefully that isnt common.,nanaimo,d46wolj,1,t5_2rokp

If we wanted to end harm wed be more easily served by throwing the entire lot in an institution because at this point thats all the safe X site concept really is. The police do not enforce drug laws because the politicians have enacted a unworkable prohibition framework to appease drug addicts of the electorate. This blight of drugs that can never go away is an entirely selfinflicted problem and it is only necessary to enforce the law to rid this cancer. Its an artificial problem,nanaimo,dc4omy7,-1,t5_2rokp

As far as I can tell all his critics are also against it.Why do Bill Bestwick Gord Fuller Jerry Hong Bill Yoachim and Jim Kipp all agree on this and why does Gord support it even though many of the people who usually support him dont want it?
