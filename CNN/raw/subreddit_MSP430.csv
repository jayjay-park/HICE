1761604,0,t3_2eklqd,One thing that I dont think people have mentioned is that you will probably want some kind of logic analyzer  its an indespensible tool when working with micorcontrollers. The Saleae Logic or USBee  channel analyzers are really all youll need for debugging most applications most communications will be  wire spi or  wire IC. The others are correct that the launchpad serves as your FET...Developing for the  will be significantly different than Arduino  from what Ive seen Arduino is the fuck it just make it work development method  great for prototyping ideas but doesnt teach you anything about actual embedded development. The best development skill you will learn when using the  consequently the part that Arduino largely glosses over is understanding how to read manuals. The worst thing about  is that you have the read the manuals very carefuly. Each different device type FGetc... will probably have different functions available on different pins and each set of pins may have secondary or even auxillary functions  so switching between series means you will have to change pins both in software and hardware accordingly.,MSP430,ck17gmw,3,t5_2s7ya
