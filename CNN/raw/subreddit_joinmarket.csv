5444108,0,t1_cw7iz3f,I see your point. I suppose a decentralized messaging protocol would be better. A lot of people using joinmarket care about anonymity so I think some sort of effort should be made to build it in.,joinmarket,cw7jcrc,3,t5_37mhm
5488518,0,t3_3q27ys,Is there a possibility of skimming a fraction of the makers profits? I think I would be quite comfortable redirecting  or  of the market making profits towards development.Im not sure how this could work in terms of privacy and whatnot. ,joinmarket,cwd7ivz,1,t5_37mhm

5683420,0,t1_cx1h393,Yes but youll have the same effect if you swept them together. Theres a reason you cant sweep multiple mixdepths.,joinmarket,cx1l0ww,2,t5_37mhm
5697181,0,t1_cx3a118,As mentioned in the thread just revert back. It looks like putting it on a branch until we figure out an easiermore acceptable install process is going to be needed.,joinmarket,cx3agam,1,t5_37mhm
5715935,0,t3_3tf950,I could add a couple of points we started discussing this kind of behaviour as a possible snooping attack here a while back.There is also an active discussion ongoing in IRC about what best to do about it.I have written a minimal but working implementation of ban specific input utxos after N retries but it has big drawbacks which I try to outline here .,joinmarket,cx5m8pj,3,t5_37mhm
6325308,0,t1_cz8m2gt,Youre welcome!Even so a server timeout shouldnt cause the bot to crash. It should calmly wait and then try again until it connects.Youre right that connecting bitcoin over tor probably wouldnt cause such a crash.,joinmarket,cz8mafr,1,t5_37mhm
6341716,0,t1_czago7f, is pretty solid if youve got enough bitcoin. Only cost is a few pennies of electricity.,joinmarket,czahdtl,1,t5_37mhm
6848085,0,t1_d0sj9tn,you can do resync wallet in rightclick menu on wallet tab. Sorry but I didnt implement that to happen automatically. Should add it to todo list.,joinmarket,d0sjcvp,1,t5_37mhm

7898277,0,t1_d40ti1n,I guess its worth mentioning this is merged.Also I mentioned elsewhere the data in the paper w.r.t. number of people using defaults is also quite misleading since its based on blockchain data which includes a large number of false positives. From my own experience the number who used default was relatively smaller than that.,joinmarket,d43u94c,2,t5_37mhm
8313395,0,t1_d5gq2g1,I read that but what if I just start it from scratch  depth? will it pick up the coins along the way?,joinmarket,d5gqbnw,1,t5_37mhm
8941249,0,t1_d7mlbin,Would it be quicker to sync if a patch to use Electrum was written? Electrum has all these tx already indexed.,joinmarket,d7mlu6v,2,t5_37mhm
8958453,0,t1_d7ojfum,I got more volume after adding more to my joinmarket wallet.  The floodgates opened with  BTC joins,joinmarket,d7oo75t,2,t5_37mhm
8972978,0,t1_d7qbhzj,Great explanation thank you!Can I put the last two paragraphs starting with For amounts less than  on the wiki page for the tumbler Maybe with BTC instead of  so it holds true for longer.,joinmarket,d7qezov,2,t5_37mhm
9053650,0,t1_d803llo,Interesting would certainly not expect that I dont understand why its more than a few minutes. Can you let me know how much of the time is spent in listtransactions? It should be most of it. If thats the case this is just a partial fix if thats not the case then something else is happening and I need to know what.Edit I retract my should from the above. I just dont know. Also to be clear you are talking about a case where the wallet was previously synced and you were just restarting is that right?,joinmarket,d803rgg,1,t5_37mhm
10383025,0,t1_dckobfo,gt Orderbook downTheres no such thing as the orderbook separate from the activity on the message channels which are  irc channels currently although they could easily be more see issue .Youre probably referring to the public webpage at This page being down doesnt indicate anything about whether joinmarket is functioning. I restarted it yesterday but it seemed to fail to restart just restarted it again. I have been on the road for the last week or so so not paying it too much attention.Anyone can if they want to look at that view of the orderbook locally by running python obwatcher.py p port and then opening the page in their browser. You can also see the joinmarket pit by simply connecting to the IRC channel. The webpage is just something I offer for peoples convenience I dont really take it seriously and neither should users.gt cant make any joins for about a weekWhat specifically is the problem?gt cant even run a yield generatorSame questionAs I noted below last week sometime I did a few joins from taker side no problem.,joinmarket,dckzak6,2,t5_37mhm
10611781,0,t1_ddabwba,I can confirm that in the past week I have had very little success with making or taking mostly taking though even with N  or There needs to be some way to weed out nonresponsive makers...  I hope they arent eavesdroppers.,joinmarket,ddaivw8,2,t5_37mhm
