2217461,0,t3_2k4c7p,I ran my last long run September th my marathon was on Oct th. Between my long  mile run on the th and my race on the Th I ran  miles total. The longest being a  mile run. I too have a background in cycling so rather than run I swapped I a few workouts for rides. On the bike is replace the runs with a  minute ride. If you have a trainer use it to sneak in some workouts. I was able to finish my race well under my goal time. You should be fine. ,firstmarathon,clloxtg,1,t5_2xq8o

4352396,0,t3_399gis,Eat more carbs.  Going low carb for a marathon is literally one of the biggest mistakes possible.  You need carbs to reenergize. Im  and my second marathon was a .  Trust me on this you are eating healthy but you need to change a few things.  The only times I drink protein shakes are after marathons.  I eat a PBampJ after each run because it has fiber protein carbs and good fat.  Proportionally you are eating way too much protein.  ,firstmarathon,csg8xc3,1,t5_2xq8o
4518707,0,t3_3cxroq,How much running have you done before? If youre already week  into a CK you could probably run a marathon by Christmas. If you can run a K youre only about four months from a full marathon. Maybe not the fastest record but definitely a full one. You dont need a trainer hit K and then follow a schedule like Hal Higdons and youre on your way.EDIT Not sure why Im being downvoted?

5236742,0,t3_3mmmlz,Make sure you are stretching enough. Shin splints occur when both your calves and hamstrings are too tight. Where the hamstrings connect to the back of  your tibia it can pull the bone so hard it bends the bone causing tiny fractures so spend several minutes before and after running every day strechingnthe back of your legs. ,firstmarathon,cvh7u6o,2,t5_2xq8o
7218095,0,t3_4ebj2k,The Novice  will get you round and to the start line in one piece but if you can run a  half you should be aiming higher. Im using the Higdon intermediate plan at the moment as I was coming off an injury and basically starting from scratch but next time round Ill be going back to a higher mileage plan. Opinions differ as to the overall best plan but Pfitzinger and Hanson are the two most popular. Pfitz is a traditional high mileage while Hanson stresses cross training. The Pfitz  plan  weeks highest mileage week is  miles starts with  miles in the first week. You could probably jump straight into that as long as youve done a few longer  miles runs. Higdon is a solid choice for a newbie but the midweek runs in particular are too short. Youll definitely make it round on one but youve already said you want to do more than that you should look elsewhere. Having said that you might find the intermediate plan is ok as a stepping stone particularly if you plan on doing multiple marathons.,firstmarathon,d1yn40o,1,t5_2xq8o

8573771,0,t3_4x81od,gtLastly I realize my post might sound like Im holding her back but Im just a worried husbandActually that is not misplaced at all.  It is surprisingly easy for someone getting started in distance running to do too much on the legs without ramping up and hurt something.  Your concern is legitimate and it is good that youre supportive and caring.The biggest thing is that if your wife is just wanting to complete the distance she can probably do it but needs to make those long runs each week super easy.  She is okay runwalking them if she wants.  Run a few other short runs a week with less or no walking and maybe a bit faster but still easy pace. But the long ones shell be working her way up in mileage each week and she wont want to overdo it.If she REALLY wants to do it that is finish . but not necessarily race . and she made it  miles this week she needs to push distancewise not pacewise the next few weeks or so to get used to the stress of .  Something like this I just threw this together on the fly but I most plans have a  week ramp up then taper like soMon | Tues | Wed | Thurs | Fri | Sat | Sun|||||| |  | rest   |  | rest   |  | rest |  | rest   |  | rest |  | rest |  | rest   |  | rest |  | rest |  | rest |  | rest |  | rest |  | rest |  | rest | Race!   | Again EASY runs.  TO ramp up distance like this is NOT really recommended but if she if going to do it she needs to understand that it MUST be supereasy.  If this seems like too much drop the  miler and throw in another rest day. Runwalking the long run is totally fine.   Theres a saying I heard which is basically you can run in a day what you ran in a week but itll just be slow and wont be pretty.   Im confident she can finish if she listens to her body and is super easy on the pace. Then she can work on ramping up and getting on a proper training plan to do the next race a more proper way.,firstmarathon,d6day31,10,t5_2xq8o

As far as nutrition Im pretty healthy but Im  and about  so I try to get my calories up when training hard because my body just sheds weight.
