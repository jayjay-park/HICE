5508101,0,t3_3qiagu,I worked as a BA for Ottawa County in Michigan  population . Local government suffers from some pretty serious silo issues. They are increasingly relying on analysts to help get a bigger picture of the operations to procure build and integrate their systems mode efficiently. It is a painstakingly slow process with huge budget cycles well in advance of implementation and great challenges with any form of agile delivery.  Ottawa County was awesome though. Great people awesome benefits and a generally manageable workload. They are hiring a spot still I believe. Id link direct but Im on mobile. www.miottawa.org,businessanalysis,cwfpl0e,2,t5_2r48q

6696747,0,t3_44z2ej,Apologies that nobody ever got back to you on this  Ive just taken over the sub and hope that this doesnt happen again.I did all my training in the UK and have several certifications administered by the British Computing Society but this was done in conjunction with a fair amount of on the job training and some shadowing of experienced Business Analysts. Is there any sort of business analysis function that you can go to for help and advice in your current place of employment?  With regards to the specific programme youre looking at the material its trying to align with is provided by the IIBA which is certainly one of the major global players so it would most certainly be worthwhile.  Sadly the price of professional certification is rarely cheap  if its just the knowledge youre looking for then perhaps consider buying the textbooks?If youre trying to get a better understanding then it might be worth you,businessanalysis,d0c02du,1,t5_2r48q

9688208,0,t1_da79mq3,Are you enjoying your job? Also if I choose to get into this field how do you think my technical skills will come into play apart from understanding requirements more accurately. I have always been good when it comes to working with people but I also want my tech skills to be in play at all times or should I say have some tech challenges along the way,businessanalysis,da79z9m,1,t5_2r48q

10274364,0,t3_5mexor,Take the opportunity to understand how the requirements that you are testing were derived and what makes them good requirements.  If you have access to a BA who is responsible for them then ask them to explain to you what the business need is and why they have chosen to express them in that particular way.I interviewed an experienced tester for a BA position recently who couldnt explain to me what a SMART requirement was or what an atomic requirement was.  Theres no excuse for not knowing the answer when your job is to test requirements so take the opportunity to grill the BA!,businessanalysis,dc8nl2q,2,t5_2r48q
