1703845,0,t3_2dvtw2,Try rforhire but youd get a lot more interest if you gave an estimate as to what youre willing to pay per project. If there is an occasional project then I have to assume theyre pretty small. Give a baseline price so that people can negotiate with you. Details on some of the projects might help too.Good luck!,sounddesign,cjtxjrj,1,t5_2s67n

2738698,0,t3_2reps6,I like it goes nice with the movie.To give you some constructive feedbackThe only thing that could have been even beter i.m.o. im not experienced with soundtracks at all would be to change the color of the sounds of each track to emphasise the different parts of the story. It kind of felt the same all the way through But nice work!,sounddesign,cnfdml1,1,t5_2s67n
2888240,0,t3_2t5vx2,no cheating and using sample libraries?  sounds has a free sample pack!i would use white noise and various modes of distortion for both. here is a quick attempt in massive. envelopes on the LPFs one for a crack and the other for the fade out. then just clipping sshaper and ctube along the way with some added voices and a touch of reverb which i would definitely replace. I dont know if this helps but there should be a ton you could tweak from here to lead you in the direction you want. disclaimer laptop speakers just hitting key quick screen shot patch ORcrumple up a piece of paper then pitch it down. ,sounddesign,cnwe9oo,0,t5_2s67n
3266099,0,t1_cohtjk1,Its called fair use. But to answer your question ive been using video game recordings that i have stored on my ps. Game trailers are probably good to since most of the time they just show gameplay,sounddesign,cp0k8pa,1,t5_2s67n
3840993,0,t3_34c5ra,I found district  pretty relevant during my studies the vocalisation of the aliens is incredibly well worked. Pretty sure theres an interview out their somewhere explaining how they went about it involving a gourd and idle hands ,sounddesign,cqu3v0c,2,t5_2s67n
4808270,0,t3_3gp8ch,I just wrapped up a masters in Sound Design and it really depends on what youre looking for.I think the biggest thing you get out of a grad program is some thinking time and typically connections. If you want to do film stuff go to SCAD. If you want to get into games VFS is pretty solid choice.I used grad school as a time to learn pro tools synthesis field recording studio recording foley post etc. It all comes down to what youre looking for and if youd like to teach someday.,sounddesign,cu0mej9,2,t5_2s67n
4984465,0,t3_3ivzw8,A good rule of almostthumb is that if you cant find anything about a license for the sound file in  seconds than you likely dont need one. Most sound librariesfiles have a pretty obvious license page or come with a license from download. I would suggest reading up on this stuff though. Being able to talk licensing and the nitty gritty detail that it entails is a great skill for interviews bar chat with clients and other sound guys.,sounddesign,cumt9im,0,t5_2s67n
5008605,0,t3_3jhdck,I recently recorded a belt being swung. Then pitch shifted it with some verb and EQ. Came out ok. Alternatively today I reversed a thunder sample took out the low end and messed with a multiband compressor. I wasnt going for a woosh but a woosh is what I got. ,sounddesign,cupq5d0,2,t5_2s67n
5883919,0,t1_cxqseui,Operator is surprisingly similar to Sytrus but its only  operators. I actually tried a test with both synths side by side with same settings now and was able to get the same result. I think it might be a matter of my habits or something. Operator is very good for fm. Ive never used fm yet cuz Im lame and like using only native stuff. I agree about harmors saw waves. See this is kind of what I mean. What if harmors saw wave is actually default. Except its too flat I notice. Like its wave form is not dynamic like an analog might sound. Im not sure what you mean on the additive engine exactly but Im assuming you mean how you can control each individual harmonic without adding in other operators. Operator also has this. Is this additive synthesis? The harmonic table? Wow my mind got blown finally I know what is meant lol. Operator lamely does not have a grid but it does have algorithm routing preset things. Like the order of operators and different kinds of routing. I wish it was presented as a grid though. Harmor can be cool. I like the way you can left click anything to edit all modulators like envelope LFO key etc. thats super easy and awesome. I like how Sytrus does that mostly too. Or it has individual LFO and envelope for all parameters. Sorry Im using crappy language some parts here. I forgot some of them and I barely talk to other synthesists.,sounddesign,cxqwyc5,1,t5_2s67n
6452795,0,t1_czmeng6,the formant is natural because the vocoder is pitching the vocal. All of the vocoded bit is one pitch which is why you get the phasing effect as it tries to constantly pitch it up or down. The normal uneffected vocal is playing over the top of this. Theres probably a bit reduction on it as well or some saturation.,sounddesign,czmreai,2,t5_2s67n

6947897,0,t1_d13tqyf,Hey guys Thank you for all the feedback much appreciated. I take a lot of this seriously and will learn from things you are saying.I am having one problem tho with a couple things that are said and I obviously dont take everything other people take seriously I choose which one make sense to me but also have an open mind.Now I took this video from mass effect gameplay and I have the original video  it starts at I did use it a bit as a reference on where they do have empty spaces and where they dont and i dont agree with some of you are seeing as the real gameplay tells the tale. But please do reply to this and tell me im wrong and why and proove to me im wrong as I want to expand.As for the footsteps I put low and heavy footsteps when he is running when theres not much music to hide it..As for lock clicking when doors are open theres an open interface sound..as for the effort after running I did not see that in the original gameplay but i did think of it...weapons sound being beefed up your totally right.the ship flying overhead yes it could use more treble or more LOW end  i noticed tho in the original gameplay they dont even have much sound going on for the spaceship arrival. they do but its a small sound.Let me know tho as I wanna understand.The weapons could use a diff sound for some tho as they do sound a bit star wars .I find tho besides composed music in the background of the original I seem to have the same amount of sounds used.,sounddesign,d13vin2,1,t5_2s67n

7502951,0,t3_4i23q5,Great work!!!! contrary to tetri I dont think it lacks in detail I think the reason it may sound empty to him is the lack of soundtrack.Since this is to show off sound design I understand why there isnt one but had this been done for final production itd have a BG track suiting the action which would be all it would need to be ready for distribution.Great work keep it up!,sounddesign,d2v1obr,1,t5_2s67n

8392135,0,t1_d5qjtbu,Quite obviously the two words sound and design put together literally means just the designing of any sound but the most commonplace colloquial meaning for it is referring to the realm of filmtvgames. If you were to tell someone that you were a sound designer I doubt their first thought would be Oh he makes synths for music! They would assume you do postproduction.,sounddesign,d5qkbki,2,t5_2s67n
