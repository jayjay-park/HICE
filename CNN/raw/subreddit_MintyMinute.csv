6178144,0,t1_cyrvaob,I was hoping you and Teutron would do something  while singleplayer stuff is interesting having someone to chat with can help you and be just as entertaining for us.  Perhaps a Minecraft adventure map or two?  I agree it isnt always the best just watching someone build stuff havibg distinct goals or an adventure gives direction and an end so youre not on episode  of series whatever.  Id personally love to see some Minecraft content,MintyMinute,cyrw2t3,1,t5_3bq1d
