1770292,0,t1_ck0t0a0,One way Ive seen people get around the comment problem on reddit is to make their own comment saying something like If you have any criticisms or questions feel free to post them here. People are more willing to post and upvote criticism in that context.,errantsignal,ck2aud6,2,t5_2zpfh

2725412,0,t3_2r9bvp,Not really sure how to feel about this videoWhile on one hand some of those criticims are valid on the other hand the entire tone of the video told me the uploader is dissapointed he couldnt have any meaningful story element or immersion to latch ontoIm not sure why we as gamers have become so obsessed with storyline and what message it conveys no matter what it isGTA has always been known for making fun of society its a satire on society in general GTA has always been equal oportunity on its victims the rich the poor men women homosexuals hobos everyone gets smacked by GTAs rubber chicken and I love it for itAlthough I cringed at the whole torture mission I never felt empathy for the victim its hypocritical to even try and feel something for Mr K when in the next set of missions or even sandbox gameplay you rob shoot and kill peopleI cant be bothered to worry about political agendas gender issues or societal problems in the game when im about to hit a bank with a minigun and murder half the local police department with a good chunk of heroic US soldiersI love GTA V for the very same reasons you pity it for once it decided to stop focusing on one of many things and stuck to the one that matters its a sandbox game in a x more messed up version of a real life location it feels like a videogame and its been rare for me to feel that about a AAA game,errantsignal,cndv9g7,1,t5_2zpfh
2726681,0,t1_cndzjj7,Part of the reason for that is the way people die is different in GTA V than it is in IV. In IV people could fall down and be not dead and the EMTs had someone to actually save. In V when go down theyre down and done so EMTs showing up is basically for appearances because that person never had a chance.,errantsignal,cne0gb3,1,t5_2zpfh

2974460,0,t1_co5l909,Eh thats more just a bad story. You could read the script and get the same vibe the fact that its a movie doesnt really change things.A better example of a hypothetical cinemanarrative dissonance would be a stock romantic comedy where the costuming the set design camera work etc were straight out of the Matrix. The narrative is saying one thing the cinematography is saying something else and theyre clashing.,errantsignal,co67mrd,3,t5_2zpfh
3360345,0,t1_co61ybe,I would suggest you take a look at the movie PI.It uses dutch angles fisheye lenses and other cinematic techniques to emphasize the instability of the main character.You may still not like Dutch angles. You may still think he used them too much. But there is a harmony between the unstable shots and the unstable character. You can debate that harmony and you can debate whether you like the technique but you can at least entertain the idea it might have been there for a reason. I personally tend to find a story works better for me when its in harmony with its medium.,errantsignal,cpbayh0,1,t5_2zpfh

4405297,0,t3_3bhgs2,I think the issue is that the game isnt really experimental. Games like Gone Home or Papers Please were very first of the kind or at the least the first game weve had like it in a while. If the game Gone Home  came out it would really lose something that Gone home did well. Playing through Gone home I went Wow I havent experienced a story told like this which I enjoyed unlike dear Esther in a while While When I played Sunset I thought to myself This is kinda like gone home. In the end it doesnt really matter the fact that the protagonist is a POC or that the theme is intriguing because before I was asking what it all meant I was overcome with the thought Ive played something like this before and that robbed the game of all its uniqueness.TLDR The issue with the game is that before I had a chance to enjoy it I was already able to equate it to gone home ergo it lost its uniqueness that made gone home intriguing.,errantsignal,csm7mln,13,t5_2zpfh

5832102,0,t1_cxk1yrs,Thanks for the very in depth response! After I figured out this thread was around a month old I wasnt expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. Anyway onto the points Im glad the crystals are developed more at the least. While I would like hat aspect to be more core its good thats its not over utilized. The OoT style approach of changing graphicstime sounds intriguing and a good utilization of the graphicschanging from being more static outside sections like the crystals to a gameplay mechanic.  The PS loading screen is one example some others would be say the overuse of established RPGJRPG tropes instead of developing characters the final boss comes to mind the dull random encounters. The first Evoland left me with the impression that aesthetically and thematically it really wanted to be a love letter to RPGs but gameplay and writing wise it really lacked the heart of what endeared people to the genre. It didnt help that I have a lovehate relationship with meta jokes its a difficult thing to get right because it either feels modest and selfaware of its faults or just easter eggs or like its excusing them. I think the best example I have right now for both of them is in Jurassic World. Theres an early comment an audience standin makes about how its annoying that corporations are buying out and sponsoring sports fields and dinosaurs but then in the same breathe the movie has an extreme amount of lazy immersion breaking sponsorship. Some things fit I can see a theme park having novelty stores like Brookstone but some really break it like long pandering shots on every Mercedes and Samsung phone. In that case it felt like an excuse. Theres another smaller moment though where theres a meta joke about the Trex right before it returns theres a tshirt in the background with a Trex saying Im back! It wasnt exactly humble selfawareness it was more... well cute but in that case the joke worked much better. It didnt feel like a handwaved selfaware excuse.That was.... quite the sidenote on my part but I felt like I needed to clarify what I meant with why the first games humor grated on me. At any rate hearing its less in your face is a relief since most of the reason it was so grating in the first place was that it seemed very proud of itself for excuse style meta jokes.  The lengths longer than what I normally would go for for indie games especially I tend to like compact but content rich experiences Undertale and Bastion come to mind but given that it sounds like its trying to flesh itself out as more of an RPG I can forgive it for the longer playtime. It sounds like the pacing works well switching things up before it gets stale which is pretty ideal since gameplay can become especially stale in longer RPGs. Im glad that it feels more action adventure than anything else a lot of the action adventure bits in the first game felt the most polished like the aforementioned crystals. I looked into the short film linked IA that the themes would be interesting to explore in as a gameplay mechanic especially due to how taxing with limited return an overemphasis on graphical fidelity can be budgetwise and focuswise. Comparing different implementations would be an interesting discussion for a video for sure.,errantsignal,cxk460u,1,t5_2zpfh

8249308,0,t1_d58675e,Crates are exploitative in principle and advertising if not in practice. Its gambling. Now whether you scratch off a lottery ticket or hawk it outside the gas station its value is not in its physical paper but in its potential winnings. This is artificially inflated because people like gambling. Some people have a psychological addiction. This causes people to overspend on microtransactions for noncontent essentially. An inflated market of unusuals based on rarity. Unusuals that are bone simple to make but worth stupid amounts of money as people spend  on an indie game but  on mass market goliaths exploiting skinner box principles to make huge profits.Crates are exploitative. Theyre functional yes but theyre also exploitative.,errantsignal,d58pwqq,2,t5_2zpfh
