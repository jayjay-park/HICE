1229086,0,t3_286ip3,Ok so heres my story.Usually whenever theres a crowd of people I tend to shut down and cant say what I want to say. Ill be around people but Ill tend look at my phone or look at somewhere else. Im usually slow at thinking something good to say until its too late thanks okasan for passing this to me and I dont wanna go back to a topic that was happening  minutes ago. I have to think of what I have to say ahead of time otherwise if someone says something out in the blue I tend to stall when I say something my speech starts to fuck up and usually say one or two word sentences. This is why I love texting people I can take my time and think of something good to say.Usually whenever Im with  peoplemostly  person Im fine but Im usually stop talking once many people gets into the group. Again my thought process slows down and I cant say what I wanna say. Also theres a couple of people that knows me and I dont want others finding out what I like and shit like that. So whenever I want to talk to them I have to talk to them when no one else is in earshot and sometime I get irritated when I cant say what I want to say after a long period of time. Its fucking crazy to think of this.,HGD,ci7w1t7,3,t5_3227m

I work in insurance I deal with a lot of people in a day and for my job I need to actually have conversations with them to confirm information. I dont do this to try to make commision because I get paid salary not commision or to annoy you or make you feel stupid. I do it so I can make sure you know what youre covered for and what youre not covered for and to verify any changes.I constantly have people ignoring every word I say and barely answering my questions or just aggressively telling me its all the same! Im sure it is all the same bu I am legally obligated to ask if I fuck up your insurance and something goes wrong I can be fined and lose my job and cost my company thousands.But someone will always get to the point where the policy is done were signing the papers and THEN they start going Oh I thought I had this coverage or I needed to change this...
