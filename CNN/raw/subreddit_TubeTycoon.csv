7657910,0,t1_d3cnfkv,Yes this is ultimately how I fixed the problem. I have to load Tube Tycoon without OBS on and then turn it on. Sometime this causes strange crashes though.Thought I should also add this in here instead of starting a new thread but I cannot scroll in Tube Tycoon on my laptop despite having a mouse with a scroll wheel hooked up. Neither the scroll wheel nor arrows on the keyboard scroll my game.,TubeTycoon,d3cntir,1,t5_3dc56
