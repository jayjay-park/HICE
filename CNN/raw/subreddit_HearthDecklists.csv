206453,0,t1_cf1ojwi,Im torn between this Druid and Rogue deck. The times I got Innervate  Alarmo turn one I absolutely wrecked.

230859,0,t3_1wqmo4,I cant talk about specific cards per se.  Something which has been working a little for me is to take some of the popular decks floating around and use those as a template if possible.  In other words substitute cards you do have for Legendary or other cards you dont.  If a card is card draw maybe incorporate a different type of card draw.  If a card has charge such as Leeroy maybe use Arcane Golem in its place.Its not as easy though with a Druid because many of their class cards give you options to chose from and neutrals dont do this.  Plus they are often late game decks which tend to rely on Legendary cards like Ragnaros or Ysera which cant really be easily substituted for.  There is a druid aggromid game deck of sorts floating around I looked quick and couldnt find one to link.  That deck might be easier to use as template since it has more neutral cards.  ,HearthDecklists,cf4od4i,2,t5_2zzem
241228,0,t3_1wurzt,wild growth seems awkward if youre trying to beat them down.the biggest thing that will help is just getting all the best value cards into the deck. Youre missing x druid of the claw x keeper of the grove x harvest golem.start with the above but eventually youll want to replace more slots with key rares and epics. knife jugglers  pyromancers over raptors commanders over ogres. epics are expensive but x ancient of lore seems mandatory right now.nourish is okay but leave it at  if youre going to use it. starfire is slow consider starfall which is cheaper and more flexible. i understand the need for draw but the amount you have is overkill.many people are using force of nature  savage roar as a  damage finisher.,HearthDecklists,cf5r6yf,3,t5_2zzem
264120,0,t3_1x28ad,I will try to update this with more of my mulligan strats although many are similar and you can get a general sense just from these two  as I consider these two some of the hardest matchups.  Alright Ill try to post my mulligan strats here! Disclaimer  These are done by memory and do not guarantee ez wins everytime.  Also it is impossible to not get board cleared sometimes and you just have to resist the urge to kill yourself because everyone you beat feels the same way.       Druid  Assuming this is your standard control deck and he doesnt get a ridiculous start such as   Turn  Innervate  Golem   Turn  Innervate  Keeper  Innervate Coin  Yeti If they do you may need a Soulfire but there is no way to predict this.  Going st  Go for Voidwalker  Flame ImpMurloc Tidecaller  Murloc Tidehunter Coldlight Seer Basically a good      curve in which the rd turn would let you buff at least one Murloc May be risky to play Warleader if they didnt use Wrath Definitely get rid of Double Soulfire  Power Overwhelming Leeroy amp Old Murk EyeGoing nd Go for any of the power  drops dropped together. Such as Voidwalker  Flame Imp  Double Tidecallerwhich can result in turn  lethal if not dealt with  Double Priestess Coin Tidehunter may also work. Then go for the SeersWarleader and a possible Abusive Sergeant to deal with innervate drops. Do not drop Leper Gnome Abusive Sergeant unless there is no other minion you can play.Rogue   Again difficult starts to deal with include Coin SI Agent Backstab  Evicerate Argent SquireTurn  Backstab SI AgentGoing st   Pretty much go for Voidwalker and Priestess as this can be very good combine with Abusive Sergeant for dealing with SI Agents. The Tidehunter can also be good as Rogues do not have too much AoE early on but beware of Fan of Knives.Going nd   Dropping Voidwalker Priestess into Tidehunter into a SeerWarleader can be a very good start if they are unable to clear the board  put annoying minions such as CancerHarvest Golem. Dropping Double Tidecaller into Tidehunter then Seer can be devastating but will utterly fail in the face of double Backstabs or Backstab Evicerates. Basically do this only if you want to for some reason or you know they do not have Backstab in hand somehow.Hunter  This is so fcking annoying.Beware of   Explosive Trap Explosive Trap Explosive TrapGoing st  nd Get a fcking Coldlight SeerVoidwalkerand some MurlocsPreferably the TidhunterTidecaller There is not as much strategy in this mulligan as the main worry is Explosive Trap which is countered by Seer.,HearthDecklists,cf84w39,6,t5_2zzem

If youre referring to zoo decks then that matchup is simply bad for you youre gonna have a bad  time and theres not too much you can do. Against charge hunter though they should have a difficult time once you get sunwalkersmark of the wildsenjins out.

1253523,0,t1_ciakxht,Have a read through of the barbarian warrior deck especially then because it really goes into the game plan of the deck which is to control the board through about turn  then just go for the face which is why anything that costs  or more has to do damage the turn it comes into play which is the thing your deck really lacks at the moment although you do get into the idea of it with your big stealth minions as theyre guaranteed damage.Of note both of them run bloodsail raiders its actually a very good  drop for warriors.  I know youre saving your gold but there are a couple commons you can pick up which will really help out first among them is leper gnome.  You dont currently have any  drops and instead are opting for whirlwind which isnt really in line with the game plan of aggro you really want  or   drop minions and they should deal guaranteed damage which is why leper gnome is so good.Get rid of the pandas they slow you down and as an aggro deck the entire point is that you want to kill your opponent as quickly as possible.  Shield block and Gnomish inventor also should go.  Youre an aggro deck you want to deal damage quickly not draw out the game so you can drop a big dragon.Looking at your mana curve your deck is superheavy on  drops.  Id definintely drop the warsongs theyre really only good when youre already winning and youd really rather have cards that are always good.Add the two spell breakers in.  Silence is really key to getting around big taunts to push through the last few points of damage a big dude with taunt that i cant deal with is one of the real problems all aggro warrior decks have.  ,HearthDecklists,ciamxc3,1,t5_2zzem

4255579,0,t3_39oit3,Antonidas is a win condition in a wide variety of mage decks. His power has also been greatly improved with the addition of the spare parts cards. There are so many combos that make him an instant win Sorcerers Apprentice  Spare Parts if you get a decent Emp Thrussian turn if you have a Finnicky Cloakfield spare part in hand if you can save your coin until turn  etc.However in almost all of these cases Antonidas acts as a finisher. You play until you have him plus combo and it puts you over the edge or you sneak in a quick win with double fireball before your opponent finishes you off. He is another threat in decks that aim for tempo advantage.Alex on the other hand is almost required in a lot of control and freeze decks. Most of those decks dont work without Alex as a big answer or massive combo piece. Think about it Alex is  damage plus body Antonidas is  a  body and hopefully  or  fireball damage anything more than  fireballs and you would have one the game anyways. There isnt really any good replacement for Alex. And as others have said Antonidas can only be used in mage decks and he isnt even autoinclude there. A lot of mage decks dont use him. Alex has a lot broader potential.Other minor considerations Antonidas can potential be mind controlled and one of the most humiliating loses Antonidas is not vulnerable to BGH people get more salty when they lose to an Alex combo than when they lose to an Antonidas combo.,HearthDecklists,cs5bkdp,1,t5_2zzem

The trick is getting it to hit where you want. Its also a good trigger for flamewalkers. So if you play to remove their board itll give you the extra oomph. And you can improve your rng luck by removing the easier stuff and then popping this.

6085338,0,t3_3ytsox,Cheap mage decks can be effective. A lot of new players start there because it is the tutorial deck and the flexible hero power. I played a self created mage deck with the base cards and the two or three packs I got from doing the tutorial stuff until my hero was in the s never moving beyond rank  and having a great time.Some general points of advice Your removal is your most important resource. People are going to drop Dr. Boom or some other legendary on you and you dont have a similar answer. Polymorph silences deathrattle effects which makes it better than Flamestrike in those instances.Flamestrike is  mana for a  damage board clear but if the opponent has a dangerous  health minion on the board flamestrike  ping is worth it if it means you get to fight again next turn.At the higher ranks where you are Frost Nova will stall the entire board and a lot of less skilled players will throw down more minions making your follow up Flamestrike or Blizzard even more effective.Fireball is great large body removal as well as an excellent finisher for face damage. Be careful about using it to lower your opponents HP before the late game though.  face damage on turn  is pretty meaningless unless you are trying to end the game before turn  and playing a very aggressive deck.Frostbolt is really great. Use it to stop weapon classes from attacking Warriors and Truesilver paladins especially as three damage removal as  damage with a fireball and to stall big minions. If they drop a large minion you cant control frostbolt will keep it from finishing you for a turn while you either try to finish them off or dig for removal. Your Hero Power is very flexible but also antitempo. Dont rely too much on your hero power. Sure it can remove a minion but it also spends two of your mana and prevents you from putting something on the board. Dont fall into the trap of hero powering too often in the early game. Minions need to be played a turn in advance to be effective so you need to plan ahead.,HearthDecklists,cyh9mxm,1,t5_2zzem

Its about your hp your hand and enemys hp.So tempo minions such as water elemental dont accomplish the roll of avoiding you taking damage as good as a frost nova for example. As far your hand goes  mana azure drake is a huge cost when you can play  mana engineer that replaces itself and allows you to look for more options in the same turn.Also as mentioned in other comment forgotten torch is a really good  card in freeze mage.

8167983,0,t1_d4ygqcy,Hey thanks for the reply. I have tried it on ladder last month and got to rank . Im sure it can absolutely go farther but I just didnt have the time to grind the games. I played a lot of the games on mobile so didnt have the deck tracker to use unfortunately. I would guess it was at around a  winrate with about  or so games played in ranked and countless games in casual testing beforehand.The deck could certainly use a lot more testing but in practice I had a ton of fun with it and absolutely ran away with some games like no other priest deck I played could do. For instance the opener of Northshire Cleric and Injured Kvaldir on turn  with coin. If you have circle of healing even better. Instant draw and a  and  on turn . Theres just so many synergies I found while playing I felt I had to share it lol.This deck did well vs aggro with the proper draws and had a pretty decent time vs control too. The hardest matchups come with bad draws as with any deck. The nice thing about this though is as a priest you have a lot of comeback mechanics to give a chance for big tempo plays to occur. Also Resurrect with injured blademaster can be manipulated to occur if you dont get your  drops early and you get a potential  mana  even if the original blademaster dies which usually ends up being gigantic.I would love for more people to try it out just so I can get a better idea of how it runs myself or even any possible replacementssuggestions.,HearthDecklists,d4yjpzo,2,t5_2zzem

8805914,0,t3_50q93o,I got it to work using token druid just gotta get a board of wisps with force of nature on em and then once he clears you have a full board of s. I also threw in a tree of life so I could instantly heal and get a  drop with AtieshI guess tree is a wild card though so you might want to use some Moonglade portals instead ,HearthDecklists,d76cnz8,2,t5_2zzem

8920111,0,t3_516feg,Hows your deckbuilding going? did you find what you were looking for?One thing you may want to do if youre getting help from someone is to use Hearthpwn since they have an app you can run that will sync your collection with their site. Then you can show someone exactly what cards you have to work with and you can ask Hearthpwn to only show decks that you can make right away.,HearthDecklists,d7k2f1a,3,t5_2zzem
9155016,0,t1_d8c6qjm,Sooo... Basically I should play something else I suppose. Anyway thank you for your response. It was very helpful. Also do you know something about Aggro Divine Shield Paladin? Is it consistent? Viable?,HearthDecklists,d8cgq5v,1,t5_2zzem

10133293,0,t3_5kv1y5,might want to remove  or  dragon fire potion holy nova is probably better especially in combo with northshire cleric and considering that you have many nondragon cardsalso I find drakonid operative quite useless book wyrm or historian are much better,HearthDecklists,dbsdg7z,1,t5_2zzem
10272472,0,t3_5myti1,Cards Id like to see roughly in order Kabal Courier Imp Gang Boss More dragons Fiery Dragon isnt great but you dont have many options and its a better Acidic Swamp Ooze against any nonweapon class except my Reno Mage that runs Medivh muawhahaha! Second Hand Bruiser Refreshment Vendor  Argent Squire probably no room but its a solid drop in Reno decks and can be used to fill out your mana usage on almost any turnCards Im not crazy about Twisting Nether  Chillmaw without NZoth but its a dragon so what ya gonna do? Defender of Argus slightly better with Imp Gang Boss thoughThis might be blasphemous but if you cut the LeeroyFacelessPOEmperor Thaurissan combo that would open your deck up to play a much more grindy value game perhaps with Jaraxxus in one of those slots,HearthDecklists,dc8fvs9,1,t5_2zzem
10564759,0,t3_5r5m4b,Maybe in Wild you could come up with something. Definately Justicar to help you get closer. Maybe a Reno deck. However skipping  seasons to get to below rank  is probably the best advice I can give  There have been player who managed to make some sort of control Hunter. Best is probably to look into those and start doctoring away from there. ,HearthDecklists,dd5mv9y,1,t5_2zzem
10743221,0,t1_ddnvi8n,The rotations happen with the release of the first new set of a year. Over the last few years the first new set has been released in midApril so its basically quite strongly assumed thats  when well be seeing more cards this year.,HearthDecklists,ddo2yku,2,t5_2zzem

11343278,0,t3_61vxb7,I mean your list isnt super refined theres a post on rcompetitive detailing all the water rogue decks people have been using but if you know how to pilot this theres no reason you couldnt hit  with it.  If youre struggling to get to  its probably because there are nuances about the game you arent getting yet or you just havent hit the button enough i.e. played enough games.  Either way give it time and maybe watch some streams and youll be comfortably at  in the next month or two.  Id also say throw in Finja and  murloc warleaders and  of the charging murloc if you have them.  Turns out those cards are damn good in aggressive rogue deck.Beyond that I cant tell you what youre doing wrong without watching you play but time and focus will fix whatever kinks you have.Best of luckps rcompetetive may be a better place for this kind of question.  They do a a QampA every week or so post your questions there.,HearthDecklists,dfhqoge,3,t5_2zzem
11506486,0,t3_648x0z,Put together this deck in an attempt to use Sherazin as a value engine while controlling the board with cheap spells and minions who have removal battlecries.Having decent luck with the deck so far but its having problems with Exodia Mage due to the number of freeze effects they can generate in a single game.Thinking  Jade Shuriken  Fan of Knives  Nzoth  Dirty Rat  Evolved Kobold  Malygos.Hoping for some second opinions from more experienced players.,HearthDecklists,dg09eue,1,t5_2zzem
