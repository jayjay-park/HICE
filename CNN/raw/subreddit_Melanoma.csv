4046451,0,t1_crh9g1v,Thats a good idea. I might just get my family doctor to remove my mole first and then get it checked out. I feel you too that its very nerve wracking. Im hoping that you get your responses back soon as well!,Melanoma,crhiya9,2,t5_2vjxi
4580034,0,t1_ct6p9fa,That is probably true. Is there any way for regular members to do this or do we need to ask ukurtkaboom to do it?,Melanoma,ct7x1j7,1,t5_2vjxi

4947490,0,t3_3ibvlw,Thats great news! I was diagnosed last week with a subungual melanoma and just had a third of my big toe removed. Waiting on the sentinel lymph node biopsies now youre right the waiting is the hardest thing. Wish I got a cool scar instead of just a deformed stub toe. ,Melanoma,cui66fq,2,t5_2vjxi

7136344,0,t3_4d9rw2,Dont beat yourself up.  The fact that it hasnt been changing is good although it is a good thing that you are seeing the dermatologist.  It wouldnt be a bad idea to set up yearly appointments for checkups even if this turns out to be nothing.  Just so you know what to expect if the Dr thinks it is suspicious enough heshe will numb you up real good.  Then they will take a sample for a biopsy and send it to the lab.  Some Drs seem to like to go ahead and remove the mole right then others like to wait for the biopsy results.  my doctor is a waiter.  Youll be left with a little ouchie when the numbness goes away but it wont be bad.   The lab usually takes  days to report back so youll have to manage your imagination which will be running wild.  Once you get actual facts then you will know next steps.  It could be absolutely nothing.  It could be an atypical mole meaning it isnt cancer but its good we got it now and we should keep an eye on you in the future or it could be one of the more benign skin cancers or melanoma.  You just dont know.  ,Melanoma,d1pboiw,1,t5_2vjxi
7348021,0,t3_4fygp0,That is a biopsy. Using cauterization or not has nothing to do with if one thinks its cancer. I know my derm is super fast so perhaps they did and you didnt realize. Hope that helps.,Melanoma,d2df463,1,t5_2vjxi
9949972,0,t3_5i0bhc,Yup it does. At least in my experience. I was turned down for life insurance last year. Had melanoma removed in  so had been less time... And had a few scares along the way that always turned out negative but those extra tests probably didnt help my case. I was told to apply again in a few years but was told my rates will be much higher than someone without a history of Melanoma. ,Melanoma,db4i9lr,3,t5_2vjxi

11488849,0,t1_dfy1xdy,just because it wasnt exposed to sun doesnt mean it cant develop a melanoma. ,Melanoma,dfy9cyy,1,t5_2vjxi
