7077676,0,t3_4cir4y,I voted third and as an added idea maybe spending enough could print out the actual number grade instead of the converted letter grade.I realized today while playing that my man hours idea really makes it hard to play this game casually so while it would be added depth I dont know if the community at large would appreciate it.,FootballCoach,d1imauo,2,t5_3d6uz

7333100,0,t3_4ft3u5,For iOS it saves after every game so users dont need to manually save. Actually Im not exactly sure uSHIVADOC might be able to give a better explanation of saving on iOS.For Android saving only saves progress from the beginning of the season. So if you play  games save and then reload you will be sent back to the beginning of the season. But if you play though the entire season recruit and then save next season progress from last season will be saved.Eventually within a couple weeks hopefully I hope to implement end of season saving for Android so that users dont have to play through a season and recruit in one sitting. And farther in the future I may implement midseason saving.Hopefully that clears it up glad you enjoy the game!,FootballCoach,d2bq1m1,2,t5_3d6uz

9992236,0,t1_dba03ue,Yeah right now you get placed in a random conference that will probably be changed by release. What do you mean by whehn you play the games it leaves you stuck looking at the stat lineup and the score? Are you talking about the Play Game vs Sim Game where something happens?,FootballCoach,dba0ljr,2,t5_3d6uz
10006532,0,t3_5ioojn,Found a bug. My team made it to march madness. As i was watching the game the screen whited out then skipped to recruiting.

10819374,0,t1_ddrxnkg,I had a Pro Football Coach game where I had around  or  seasons worth of playing. I think I had around  champ bowls.

11159286,0,t3_5yx729,The games designers have said that football IQ is what governs turnovers for the team. The overall average football IQ affects it but QB and Safety have the biggest impact ,FootballCoach,deww5r7,1,t5_3d6uz
11328552,0,t3_5zeaa2,Yesterday my star Running Back finally retired. Had over  yards rushing. He played until he was  and was still around  overall all with my team. Broke the rushing record by about  and the TD record by about  think he had like  or .
