6435597,0,t3_439csr,Finally! The bug has now been fixed! Unfortunately all the upgrades already purchased wont give the extra push they need. But all future upgrades will.,CityInc,czkz8v4,1,t5_3c42g
6653842,0,t1_d07jpvj,Good idea! I agree this needs to be implemented.EDIT Its been implemented! It will show up as a button option right under the available tiles in the City Tab after the reset. Thats when it will take the backup.,CityInc,d07kchh,2,t5_3c42g
6669407,0,t1_d08v2q6,Awesome good to hear it worked out!,CityInc,d0969te,1,t5_3c42g
6707430,0,t1_d0d3r1h,The storage used is called Local Storage. Its not a cookie and as a user its not as easy to export and then import. But I will build this into the game as soon as possible since its a big requested feature.,CityInc,d0d3thy,3,t5_3c42g
6811677,0,t3_491n62,This is actually intended. The price increase for roads are . and then apartments are . offices are . local transport are . all the way down to banks that are . again.So this is actually by design and fully correct.,CityInc,d0oefoi,5,t5_3c42g
7048648,0,t3_4c5e75,Thanks for the update!! Much appreciated.However here is some constructive criticismgt  new buildings are now available.Im only seeing  Small Store Garage and High Rise. Wheres the fourth one?Also these new buildings look way too expensive to me. I currently have  of everything and  banks and shopping centers but I have probably less than . of the money required to buy the cheapest of those new buildings. gt About  updates have now been added. Finally right? Thats great and all but you really need to add upgrades that will help get from the s to the s.  Theres an enormous gap between those two achievements that took me over a month to accomplish and there are NO USEFUL OR AFFORDABLE UPGRADES to help.  The new upgrades that you just added are all way too expensive to help out.  I suspect that Im well over a month away from being able to afford even the cheapest of your new upgrades.  Im enjoying watching your progress building this game. I know from personal experience that figuring out game balance is not easy. ,CityInc,d1fblv5,3,t5_3c42g

7279168,0,t3_4f3emx,Thats part of the game!The multiplier for apartments is bigger then the multiplier for bank. So even if the bank start more expensive the apartments will cost more passing a specific point and be more expensive.,CityInc,d25lclo,2,t5_3c42g
7302383,0,t1_d27z5qt,Interesting my policy has been to double the number of citizens with each reset.  That way in theory it should halve the amount of time required to build back up to the same point I was at before the reset.,CityInc,d288cj7,1,t5_3c42g

8849806,0,t1_d7aajem,Perhaps in a SimCity kind of way... where there are random thought bubbles like I wish the busses came to my house.  TransportI cant seem to find a job.  BusinessMy rent is too high!  Civilian,CityInc,d7bmd7e,1,t5_3c42g
8881254,0,t3_51wbg5,It is actually optional. You get no penalties if you dont use it so it is safe to just ignore. Also since some people dont like it I will make an option to hide the smiley face so you dont have to see it in the settings in the upcoming version.But you can get some nice bonuses if you do use it. It is basically just Black Jack and you can play it without betting any cash. If you do you only bet the confidence percentage. Youll get more the closer to  you are if you win. But if you loose you will only loose .Personally I kind of like the system how it turned out. But if you dont there is no penalty if you want to ignore it.And since this game is sort of developed around the community I always read feedback. Always. So if you have any suggestions on how to improve it Im very eager to hear you out! Also my best tip is to play it safe. Always hold the argument around  or so and you should probably be fine.,CityInc,d7fegme,6,t5_3c42g
9146048,0,t1_d8azqq4,Well the CSS is needed otherwise the page will look like a notepad document. However I should be able to have a checkmark for the animations. Those are the most heavy processing wise. Ill see if I can do something in the next version.,CityInc,d8bbspk,1,t5_3c42g
