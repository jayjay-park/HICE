6458210,0,t3_4412fh,So I hope you can get a CC of max hogs? Make  dragons  hogs  Giant and  archers.  heal spells  poisons.Drop the giant near the CC pull whatever is in there out. Put one archer way down on the edge of the map at about  oclock. Draw the cc as far down there as possible until it dies. Then drop  more archer. Repeat until all  archers are dead or the CC is in the open. Poison it and drop  dragons on it immediately put  dragons on the lab at  oclock and the army campelixir pumps at  oclock. When the CC is dead put last  dragons in between them all. Now put  hog on the mortar at  oclock wait  seconds put the last  hogs and the CC on the same mortar. The hogs will path mortar wiz tower mortar ad and the rest of the core. Heal early on the wiz towerad area. Then drop the second heal when the hogs jump out or the first one ends. Then use the last heal focus on any hogs going up to the last air defense. Good luck. ,ClashofClansStrategy,cznbm0h,2,t5_32goy
