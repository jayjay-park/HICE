1331174,0,t1_cij9p1f,The simply answer to your question is simply that its because GMs only have access to the current players.GMs in game dont generally have an easy way to contact players who no longer are in game aside from social media. However that doesnt mean that we dont try to ask and get information out there about GS.  Its exactly why we offer the summer promotions and occasionally we have codes posted on Facebook to get a free month or two upon returning etc. This is one of the reasons why were looking into other options of outreach such as Reddit Facebook etc.  When we first started up our Facebook page a few years back we did a promotion for returning players if you recall.  Im fairly sure there was plenty of discussion then with former and returning players on this subject and the discussion continues now about what would bring them back and help keep them back.  I think that retention and recruitment is always a background discussion thats been ongoing over the years.Please feel free to make any suggestions as to how we could improve.  We do see a regular flow of new players though.  Just a little bit of watching or working with the Mentors proves that.  Its turning those new players into long term customers that falls not just on the GM teams but also on the players to be welcoming and accommodating.  Fortunately we have a lot of those.Lastly its important that you recognize that GMs ! the Simutronics Office.  So sometimes we GMs want to do something but we only have so much say.  We basically can suggest and request certain action but it doesnt always happen that way.  Example?  Id love to see promotional codes sent out to the former players email addresses.  Can I do anything more than suggest that it happen?  Negative Ghostrider the pattern is full.,GemstoneIV,cijdh35,2,t5_2sj4p

10512403,0,t1_dczmn68,okay because I press talk but nothing happens really.  I talked to merchants and a dwarf and a bank lady. but the monk has no options........or maybe Im dumb and he doesnt talk because hes a monk? ,GemstoneIV,dczoy9q,2,t5_2sj4p
10726160,0,t1_ddmahwn,Edit There are people that seem annoyed and saying he made that video only after being paid by Simutronics....but if they did pay him I think it was a good move.His target audience is folks who would potentially be interested in GSs world and play and someor many of whom dont even know GS exists. ,GemstoneIV,ddmbnno,2,t5_2sj4p
