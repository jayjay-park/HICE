1912344,0,t1_ckjlmia,you should give it a try. essentially you start with a small weird shape in the middle. like an amoeba shape. and then just trace around it with different colors and trace around it again with a different color and then again with a different color until it gets really big. the trick to getting it to look like a geode would be to use a monochromatic color scheme. and the most difficult part would be painting the crystals part that sits within the innermost shape. i went to art school and have done a lot of painting. i can tell you with confidence that this is totally doable by a novice with enough time and patience.,MineralPorn,ckjmiqg,3,t5_2ud0r

7616806,0,t1_d377xx8,Clarification The first post was an offhand joke the mineral in question is obviously not plastic. My second post was a comment on your rhetoric. You implied being around something imparted knowledge of that thing as if expertise occurs via osmosis. So I suggested rephrasing your argument to show your expertise came not from osmosis but from an active interest all things sparkly. Thus assuring me of your claim that the mineral in question is in fact not plastic. Unfortunately I feel compelled to point out you have made two additional missteps in the rhetoric department First you sarcastically stated ...Im glad you know my own gems so much which youve never held or examined yourself. which taken within the context of your original post is fairly ridiculous. The absurdity lies within the fact you asked for clarification on the substance of your stone from individuals who ...have never held or examined the stone themselves. Second you attempted to bolster your gem vs plastic argument by providing the origin of the gem. Normally this would be a good tactic however plastic is routinely set in gold silver and platinum rings thus negating the core of this argument. Perhaps establishing the pawn shops rigorous attention to detail and no plastic policy would create a more compelling argument. TLDR Its plastic and you need to work on your rhetoric.  P.s. While not officially needed I suggest you start using an oxford comma vampire weekend might have you believe no one gives a fuck about an oxford comma I think it is important. Please refer to this picture   as an aid explaining the importance of the little dash.,MineralPorn,d37zp13,0,t5_2ud0r

If its expensive Ill do a quick Google search to make sure that it isnt priced incorrectly. If I dont find similar quality priced much lower from a reliable source I go for it. You are buying a one of a kind piece made by the Earth under just the right circumstances. I have only felt regret for the ones I loved and walked away from. Edit Someone more informed about this will hopefully help me our but I think the appraisal suggestion you were given below is way too low.
