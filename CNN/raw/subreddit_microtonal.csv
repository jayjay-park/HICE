4113643,0,t1_crp4xjo,My software has within it the ability to create chords as it uses a MIDI library created by someone else. My software just doesnt create chords all that often yet its early. But the important thing is that the tools are all there to do pretty much anything.And did you check out the other software I linked to? Also Scala will produce tuning tables that are supported by a variety of synths so that might be another approach though I havent played around with it at all.,microtonal,crp6it0,1,t5_2typs

10799783,0,t1_ddt43b2,This is a great way for one to get into microtonalism without needing specialized notation software or VSTis. In any sequencer or any notation software that exposes synth settings you can set up two identical instruments and detune one by  cents to get  EDO.,microtonal,ddtx5hv,2,t5_2typs
