211565,0,t1_cf2hznp,Quite simple actually.You see Istanbul was Constantinople.  Now its Istanbul not Constantinople.  Been a long time gone Constantinople.  Now its Turkish delight on a moonlit night.Not only that but every gal in Constantinople lives in Istanbul not Constantinople.  So if youve a date in Constantinople shell be waiting in Istanbul.Even old New York was once New Amsterdam.  Why they changed it I cant say.  People just liked it better that way.So you might say take me back to Constantinople.  Sadly no you cant go back to Constantinople.  Been a long time gone Constantinople.  Why did Constantinople get the works?  Well thats nobodys business but the Turks.As I said before Istanbul was Constantinople.  Now its Istanbul not Constantinople.  Been a long time gone Constantinople.Understand?,comedy,cf2jis2,2,t5_2qhkm

276315,0,t3_1x88rz,Incredible. Re living an interesting life  well what is the feeling that you get when you start enacting more interestingrisky things? How do you do it daily? Open mics? Planning a trip? This is a great video and it doesnt show the less romantic side of the thing  seems like the guy made a concerted effort going on tour etc... How to start? Well save a little money and line up a trip! You arent doing comedy unless youre doing it  is what I realized. I know its a truism  but its not going to come to you. You have to go to it. Sage advice from a ding dong. Its just that I started doing open mics and it has been life affirming. I like to think that I could make a video like this some day without the skateboarding and with an alcoholic macabre ending instead of a being on SNL ending. ,comedy,cf9ei4k,3,t5_2qhkm

If you create something and someone else takes it and uses it its theft. On a side note I feel like society doesnt value originality high enough in general tbh. But what the heck do I know just another nerd ranting away on the internet. I suspect a lot of comedians opinions on joke theft are swayed by having to avoid insulting other higher up comedians as its a very political industry. Maybe Maron will find himself in Amys next film for defending her so valiently. ,comedy,czcn1at,0,t5_2qhkm

10139818,0,t3_5l5jsf,The characters in the UK version felt much more real than the US characters who felt goofier and more like caricatures of real people. Ricky Gervais interviewed Larry David once and they talked about how each of them really enjoy doing realistic comedy where the viewer feels like whats happening or being said on the show would be plausible in real life. So when David Brent goes and says something incredibly stupid or uncomfortable around others the comedy hits home way harder in my opinion because theres no suspension of disbelief going on for the viewer.,comedy,dbt80xu,4,t5_2qhkm

Do we think hes a member of the KKK? No but it makes people feel superior to talk down to others who are less PC and everyone should change to be more like them.,comedy,dc4vbsh,5,t5_2qhkm
