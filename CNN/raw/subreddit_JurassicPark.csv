I would say that just the characters and the location and some events are the same in the book and the movie. This makes the book better? I dont think so.The two movies are classicAnd yes i am ignoring the third movie so its not fare to say that the book is better. But i enjoyed the plot of the book more than the plot of the movie. I would say that the plot of book is  different than the plot of the film. So i really recommend you to read TLW as soon as possible. ,JurassicPark,cjrpg1a,2,t5_2sdsw

1976869,0,t1_ckre9kn,They used a few scenes that were in the books that hadnt been fit into the first two movies. The pterasaur cage was in the first book and the lab where they were creatinggrowing the embryos en masse was in the second book and was a big plot point that tied the two books together. I thought the whole river journey was a loose throwback to Grant and kids river trip in the first book too. Other than that though I felt that most of the movie was a lot of action sequences without much substance. You could tell the script and plot were written as an action movie not adapted from books like the others albeit very loosely. Things like the talking raptors and the satphone shenanigans felt really gimmicky to me. It just didnt feel quite like Crichtons Jurassic Park to me. In my opinion it didnt capture the same feeling the other two had. Im hoping we wont run into the same problem with Jurassic World so Im giving them the benefit of the doubt on that because so far it looks pretty good.

2465552,0,t1_cmgany3,gtIt makes sense to call them reptiles since they all share the classical reptile characteristics Classical reptile characteristics? Like being coldblooded and having no feathers?Look I just poked fun out of this since JPs huge theme was all about how dinosaurs arent reptiles and it seemed that one particular fan forgot about it.gtWell maybe dinosaurs have more in common with presentday birds than they do with reptiles. Look at the pubic bone turned backward just like a bird. Look at the vertebrae full of airsacs and hollows just like a bird. And even the word raptor means bird of prey.Taxonomy is purely a human construct. Animals exist and scientists are just catching up. Animals are not obliged to conform to the classifications which scientists devise. So it is that from time to time animals are reclassified or the definitions for various classifications are amended. It was once wellknown that mammals do not lay eggsand so scientists were able to conclude that the duckbilled platypus was a hoax.Maybe the definition of reptile should be amended to include warmblooded animals. Or maybe the dinosaurs should be classed as being reptilessortofbutnotreally.

Trevorrow knows how much people hated the Spino killing the scavenger rex in JP and I think that the Spinosaurus skeleton is only there to be destroyed by the rex in homage to the Dinosaurs ruled the earth scene at the end of the first movie.   I would bet that the old rex is contained or otherwise incapacitated for most of the chaos of the movie then it makes a reappearance or is let out to deal with the Drex near the end.   However I dont think its likely that the rex will finish the Drex off itself.  The Drex will either be injured already or the rex will injure it and it will somehow wind up in the lagoon to be finished off by the mosasaurus.  ,JurassicPark,cmjv7y8,4,t5_2sdsw

But thats just my opinion.Like you said a backstory to the IRex and more explanation for what Maserati is up to. I also want there to be a moral and not just have this be a monster movie thats why JP didnt work.Good NATURAL dialogue. The trailers are making me nervous so far. Just one of those who talks like that? feelings. What I love about the original JP is that a lot of the conversationsdialogue are just people talking to each other. Very little exposition a lot of personality.Agree on the mosasaur but Im also nervous that if they include it more it will feel like overkill. We already know theres the IRex the pteranodons probably other carnivores. Like just how many threats can you have in a movie before its too much?Conservative score. Remember the Trex breakout scene in JP? No music. Made everything so much more intense. I hope there are scenes like that. My hope is that when they use release the TRex to fight the IRex since thats what most people are already predicting that theres no music in that scene.EDIT also the runtime better be at least the runtime of the original.,JurassicPark,coehdns,5,t5_2sdsw
3065611,0,t3_2v99xy,I think it was being used by Masrani long before we knew. Think about it Jurassic World has been in operation for  years now. The movies were all set in present day. So the events of JP happened in . Jurassic World opened in . It takes a lot more than  years to get a theme park on the scale of JW up and running. Given we are told that the Spino wasnt on Ingens list so Ingen had been doing things since they were supposed to leave Sorna after TLW it leads us to be suspicious as to what else they were doing behind closed doors. I think that perhaps Masrani had control over Ingen sometime after Ludlow died at the end of TLW in  and before JPIII in  and were using Sorna to test new dinosaurs. Surely Masrani could have bought the dying company within that  year period and begin plans for the park.It could explain why the raptors in the film were different to the other two films the differences could also be brought down to after many generations of breeding between raptors began to breed the frog DNA out of them replacing it with more authentic raptor DNA with each consecutive generation  I know nothing about genetics someone correct if thats possible. Basically I think Masrani were already using Sorna and that their attempts at creating new dinosaurs is possibly why the Spinosaurus looks so different to what we know assume it looks like in reality and why the raptors looked different.Of course its more than likley all of this is bullshit as they believed thats what the spino looked like when they made the film and they just had a dumb idea when designing new raptors.

Muldoon and his team presumably did incapacitate her eventually since she was briefly contained inside the holding pen along with two other Raptors but not before she had enough time to make a meal out of poor Joffrey. ,JurassicPark,cr4ntgu,2,t5_2sdsw

4253269,0,t3_39o34f,I thought that the opening would have been a scene like this but then if you think about it in the other three films the opening scene has direct implications on the story whereas a random workers death set something like  years before the events of JW eg before the park opens wouldnt have much of a connection to the events of the JW story.  I would love to see a whole movie of just the takeover over the island and setting up of the new park but from a storytelling perspective in JW it wouldnt have added anything substantial to the story. I did find it odd that there wasnt any dialogue about the original park aside from a throwaway reference from Lowrey and a casual reference by Masrani about him fulfilling Hammonds dying wish.  The intro the to the park felt very rushed and I imagine that the original script they wrote actually included a lot more stuff they just had to trim things down to get it to a reasonable runtime or to be within budget while still maintaining a good pace.One thing that I felt could have been done a lot better was entering through the gates.  Trevorrow had tweeted many months back after the whole CGI gate controversy from the original teaser that they filmed a real gate for the actual movie.  The shot in the final film lasted maybe  seconds and I honestly couldnt tell if it was real or CGI.  What I found odd was that instead of using this scene as the sweeping intro to the park they check into the hotel and open the balcony then we get the pan over the park.  The theme however starts playing softly during the monorail scene and then crescendos when Gray opens the shutters.  It just felt really out of place until that moment where the camera moves out through the window.,JurassicPark,cs525t0,1,t5_2sdsw

4289489,0,t3_3a0j9v,I thought about it and I dont think the film would be about humans versus weaponized dinos. In my assumption it can go two ways.First InGen modifies the Dino DNA like IRex at some secret facility in the states. Something goes wrong as far as creating new dinos and the virus wipes out most of the earths species aside from reptiles and other animals closely related to dinosaurs. The dinosaurs break out from their captive bred facility kill off remaining humans that werent affected. Humans try to fight back but cant because theyre overrun and hybrids dinosaurs were designed to survive all types of warfare from biochemical to physical attacks. The film is like the transition of the end of human civilization and opens the franchise to future films entering the Jurassic World where dinosaurs rule Earth once again.My only flaws about this is that this sounds too much like new Planet of the Apes plot franchise minus the intelligence of Caesar. Philosoraptor Blue anyone? I feel like its less gimmicky than seeing a TRex with a cannon and layers coming out of its back.Second option to where the franchise may go is that modified dinosaurs already set and ready to be revealed to the United States government but as we see in JW they are wild animals and cannot be controlled. Instinct drives in and destroy and wreak havoc in the city. Eventually after a long battle with the dinosaurs theyre not weaponized in the sense of ammunitions but features that make them apex predators like IRex designed to outlive and be top of food chain they eventually get killed off InGen gets shut down and end. The ending is gimmicky to stir potential sequel. A hybrid dinosaur bred with another hybrid dinosaur laid eggs somewhere and goes unnoticed. My flaw about this one is that this is like Godzilla  minus giant lizard but with just a bunch of dinosaurs running around in Los Angeles or New York.,JurassicPark,cs95aum,1,t5_2sdsw

It chased the humans despite having a big trex carcas to eat giving it no motivation outside ahh scary for it to continue to hunt the humans.Its animatronic was lifeless and stiff it was super strong when the plot asked for it fence break and weak as a compy when the heros needed to be safe not being able to open a tiny door after the fence.Everything about the Spinosaurus was off in the film when all of it combines with the shitty fight which was only there to say Hey you know that trex you all love? Well too bad my dinosaurs better. Now you should love the spino through the death of your old favourite.

6338902,0,t3_42en83,I agree with your enthusiasm for accuracy but to me accuracy also involves remembering that these are animals not goregenerating monsters. I know that is a little out of place in a series of monster movies JW suffered dissonance from trying to make us believe the dinosaurs were both animals  and monsters but it can be done. Also this doesnt at all touch on the inaccuracies of the herbivores.I think they could justify inuniverse accurate dinosaurs in a variety of ways and being covered in fluff doesnt make an animal not scary or badass in its own right but at this point Im not holding my breath that the producers will try to do anything about it.,JurassicPark,cza5v97,4,t5_2sdsw

7298083,0,t1_d26ke6g,Itd be a different kind of scary reallyThe JP designs are scary because theyre alien to us. Weve never seen animals like them so theyre inherently scary for that reason. Only issue with this is that over time as the designs become more familiar they loose that frightening edge as we see them as less and less alien.Making them eerily birdlike restores that sort of terrifying...alienness of them. Lets be honest people dont usually think of feathers as scary because they associate them with things like songbirds and chickens. Seeing these cute things pinning down and eating a man alive would definitely be terrifying on a different level to that of the raptors of yesteryear.Its that sort of Uncanny Valley where something looks so cute but is in reality much more terrifying than something deemed scary. Its that beautiful destruction of the expectations for the animals.Imagine for example if the T.rex paddock breakout had the lumbering sluggish T.rex of the s. Itd not be nearly as..well scary that way for sure.Shattering expectation is what separates good films from landmark films. Again the original Jurassic Park betrayed the norms of pop culture and made dinosaurs SCARY again because they were so different now than they had been fast agile and birdlike rather than slow lumbering giant lizards.I feel like making dinosaur feathers legitimately scary for the public is one of the most important ways to begin a sort of Soft Dinosaur Revolution a complete overhaul in the way media portrays these extinct animals that really did exist.And while I liked the way the book handled the idea I feel like itd make sense for the animals to well evolve into more and more accurate designs as part of the overarching man cannot tame nature message this series goes for.,JurassicPark,d27qqk1,1,t5_2sdsw

There is no way any of these people would ever willingly return to the islands. Which is exactly why both Grant and Malcolm had to be connedtricked into going back in the sequels both with really flimsy excuses.Besides if some Dodgsonesque third party needed an expert on Jurassic Park they wouldnt hire the paleontologist botanist or mathematician who was there for less than two days.

11805794,0,t1_dgxfe4e,The shoved the original park into a pair of scenes that served no real purpose other than having the kids find a jeep which was  years old and somehow worked with a gokart battery. They dont explore it it doesnt further the plot or shine a light on anything happening in the current version of the park. Its simply there because hey remember this from the original movie? They then repeat a beat from the original movie by having Indominus roar in the same place the TRex did at the end of Jurassic Park. Its only there to echo the original for nostalgias sake.I suspect Jeff Goldblums role in Jurassic World  will be given the same weight.
