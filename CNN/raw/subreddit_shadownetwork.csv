3645924,0,t1_cq4zyp2,Im away from my books so I cant verify... can you modify street cred like notoriety and similar with karma.  I will freely admit that Im looking at this from a rewards point of view.  I have a hard time justifying the costbenefit ratio of a lot of shadowruns.  However if you present some missions as Do this and Ill clear your record. That reward could net out as extremely valuable in the nuyen to karma to street crednotoriety perspective. ,shadownetwork,cq7v2bl,0,t5_36uyo

4853848,0,t1_cu67rjw,not to be a Debbie Downer but that would require a council vote to make house rules to allow that as there is no way to do so by raw.Not that i disagree with it i kinda like the idea within reason  i.e. what if i wanted to make bulldawg a mage? hes  karma deep or if fishy decided shizuka would be better as a nonadept or hammerhead wants to be an adept etc etc there is a rabbit hole there but thats a huge far reaching change there are proper channels to implement it those channels should be used.,shadownetwork,cu6d3rr,1,t5_36uyo

7641999,0,t3_4h3fhh,Hi Asked this somewhere else on the net but I think it ended up disappearing into the ether and asked this on Discorddeleted that post but figured this may be a better place. I was hoping to take advantage of my rat shamans ability to use any reagents by doing searches for them on my downtime. I was hoping to spend some time average  hours a day every downtime daywithin reason to find reagents. Buying hits would mean   hits from alchemy at  reagent per hour or  per dayhours. Does this make sense. Given the bonus for Rat is the reagent thing I was hoping that this could be a handwave solution for all the rolling I would be doing on gear rolling thread to achieve the same thing. This would mean that I would when I run get amount of days between runs   reagents. Does that make sense? Thanks ,shadownetwork,d3auqa7,1,t5_36uyo

8995972,0,t1_d7t5b9v,That is merely the addition to the bylaws is it not?This is an argument that Ive raised before with different people in council and senate so maybe I am in a minority in considering that it is an important part of these announcements to provide a easy way for us to compare and contrast the old text and the new. Naturally I could open the bylaws and read through them but why should every person seeking that info have to do that when it can and in my opinion should be provided right here in this post for every voter? ,shadownetwork,d7t6d1z,1,t5_36uyo
9048029,0,t3_53zdhe,I have decided to step forward for one simple reason.Perhaps you are tired of hearing the word but trancparency. From my point of view on ShadowNET thus far has been that no offence to current Senators Senate doesnt seem to actively do much. That needs to change.Senate needs to be more than the Dad Voice or Boot of the NET. Apologies for the briefness but I am posting this from my phone. I am more than willing to answer any questions and will expand farther once I return to a computer.,shadownetwork,d7zffpf,3,t5_36uyo

9073015,0,t1_d7y2uaq,Pistol Crossbows are  concealability.Light Crossbows are  concealability Medium are  Heavy are . These values are close enough to the core books listing for crossbows that if the GM is not aware they will not make a grevious mistake  it is also acceptable to simply assume that any nonpistol crossbow is .,shadownetwork,d82fgqs,2,t5_36uyo

10739838,0,t1_ddlxqoq,gt but lately have been getting more of a vibe where you seem more focused on pushing a agenda about how to play and rp and so on.To actually expand on this yes.  I totally have been pushing an agenda lately on how id like people to be less horribly scathing and One True Way to people who play in the style that I play in so I can find some players wholl actually interact with the narrative elements in my games on shadownet.  That doesnt sound a lot like how you put it but it makes sense when you consider that people are saying things like you have to do X where X is a mechanistic way of playing  ONE way of playing not the only way  and then referring to anyone who isnt doing that as someone who needs to learn how.  And games where that isnt the accepted mode as bad.So yes I jump into conversations where its a chorus of resounding no you shouldnt do that you should just minmax and roll a billion dice and not make bad decisions that your character would or youll die! and I basically say the opposite because ive gotten considerably sick of people I enjoy gaming with being told to run games in a mechanistic style and not their own style having people tell them youll do better next time when their character doesnt have minmaxed dice pools and therefore doesnt instapwn the dice gangers or the dice Host or know to use a burner commlink and end up making the team have to do a fight scene or something because of that having any discussion of motivations or characterization suddenly interrupted by a discussion of minutiae of minmaxing a street sam and ultimately those people leaving shadownet.I dislike that the monoculture is pushed so aggressively that people either change their entire gaming style to fit it and then often leave as they are no longer having fun or they simply leave because their style is clashing with GM expectations on every run and every run players are clashing against their GM expectations often intermixed with the same sort of no I had fun everything was fine  later badmouthing that GM in private to senate and anyone and everyone that ive run into recently and in the past as well.  As well as stuhl has lvn and many other GMs now no longer running games on shadownet cant think why.So yes I am arguing against that.  I think its against the founding principles of shadownet to wit that everyone should be able to play shadowrun without being discriminated against and its bad for the community and its bad for me.  Im against it.  Im definitely pushing the agenda that it should stop and that people should be adults and realize that not everyone plays games the way they do and theres nothing wrong with that.,shadownetwork,ddnqeo5,1,t5_36uyo
