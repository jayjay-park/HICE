6167686,0,t3_401iu9,On the lag issue the amount of buildings also heavily contributes to the amount of lag. Rust and all other base building games Ive played have the exact same issue. The buildingsetc are handled serverside meaning the server load increases the more shit players build and as a result everything lags out.There is no direct fix for it simply technological limitations but there are various ways to effectively mitigate it. The main issues are unnecessarily large bases abandoned bases either the players left the server entirely or gave up after their base was raided and the stupid amount of workbenches people build. Suggestions to counteract those Limit amount of ownership stakes per player. Nobody likes this idea but its sadly necessary to counteract the unnecessarily large bases players tend to build. Have all placeable items base stuff workbench etc decay rapidly on unclaimed areas. Counteracts workbench spam and abandoned bases. Ownership stake should despawn if none of the authed players are active for x time. Counteracts players building a complete base and entirely leaving the server. Limit height of claimed areas forcing players to place another ownership stake higher up if they want to build a tower without it decaying. Andor introduce building stability physically limiting how high players can build on a single area. Add material salvaging to the hammer destroy function incentivizes players to fully remove random leftover buildings.,hurtworld,cyqpa0l,7,t5_36l7m

It appeals to the PVE crowd because there is more to do than just get an auto and KOS and I would hope it appeals to the PVP crowd because it causes more confrontation in the open world and you might actually get something out of it.Honest opinion on cars the way they are implemented is bad. It basically ensures that only large group with huge amounts of time will get a car. They need to be much easier to destroydisable and much harder to store. As for raiding tools raiders are already at an advantage with the totem system. If they find your totem you no longer have a base.

A scavenging station to break down items into some of their constituent parts.. A reworking station to change car parts with the magic of RNG to other versions of themselves. For example a Nipple Wheel to a Sand Hopper or a damaged engine to a standard engine. Just throw in the item and some amber and RNG away.. More PVE of course.. A battering ram that can only break though doors. Lots of mats to make position it near a door and let it pound away while a team defends it.. Female characters and character customization in general.. Scopes that increase sighted range but not draw distance. max of  or x zoom. Binoculars maybe..

6486210,0,t3_44ghky,From someone who has most of the EA survival titles..gtAre there clans friends etc? I play in a group of .You can authorize and spawn in the same base but there is not a helpful grouping system that shows you who is in your group. Nothing stopping friendly fire. You can just set where you spawn.gtIs there much to do outside of base building?The first  days of the server everyone is farming so there is a lot of naked pvp. The people who succeed end up getting geared while continuing to kill the nakeds farming. After about a week the stronger players usually groups emerge but since everyones early goal is to stop other from developing often deleting bases early on the servers end up being split into a bunch of geared people playing together the new spawnsplayers they camp and kill and the PVE folks who are mostly just building. raiding is basically just going to delete someones base since the devs dont want sleepers most people just log off with any loot of value.gtIs it KOS?Anytime you see someone with gear they will kill you. anytime you see someone with no gear they are farming and will either run or try to kill you. For whatever reason this game is a lot worse in terms of people pretending to be friendly.gtAre there plenty of good servers that are not always full?Devs are having a hard time finding a balance between not enough official servers and a ton of empty servers. There are hundreds and hundreds of empty community servers. Another issue is that with the community servers there are about  different preferred styles of play so whatever direction the core game goes a lot of people arent going to be happy.gtDoes it bring anything new to the genre?It tried with this infamy system but all the infamy system does is ensure that groups end up with all of the gear. In its current stage it is just a negative addition. gtKnowing what you know now would you buy it again?I got my hours of fun out of it but Id much rather get my hours of fun out of it with a ton more content on a more stable launch.  doesnt mean a lot but too many hours at this stage wont leave you any motivation to play later. Id buy it but maybe in a few years whenif it releases. gtAt the moment Im playing Rust but getting pretty fed up of weekly wipes KOS cancer community and shitty updates etc.Well....The last update saw a ton of players leave and the wipe cycle is also a huge point of contention. On top of that the community is exactly the same people from rust. Very hateful and unaccepting of any criticism towards themselves or the game. If those are the things keeping you away you wont find what you want in HUrtworld but if those are just minor annoyances you might get a few wipe cycles worth of fun for your .,hurtworld,czq80ff,2,t5_36l7m
6494298,0,t3_44ki89,You are missing the point... Loot Crates are not worth now... You will try to reach higher ground with a car for a chance of get arrows? Or jus some bullets? I can make that on my own. No need to go to the containers area... The chance of getting a detonator cap is too low. Also the time for Crates respawn after you get one its too long...  The loot on Crates need to be better and the chance to find detonator caps need to be higher too. Or this game will turn in just gather resources build bases shoot people and do that again.

TBH all of the communication the developers bother to have with us is voluntary  it may be good business but its still voluntary . They achieved what they needed and that was capital to pay the bills while they finish the game. The best thing Ive read from any of their Dev Blogs or announcements yet was  weeks.

Or keeping your main totemchests in the centre of your plot high up meaning they cannot build up the sides and C from there.Obviously metal walls are harder to destroy but harder to get at the same time.

The plus side is yiu are not punished for defending yourself or killing people for resources. The hard to build tools will stay with you at all times.  The negative side is people who slaughter endless people for a slight increase in resources have nothing to lose.,hurtworld,d59z9e5,1,t5_36l7m
8347651,0,t1_d5kzi70,what you are not understanding is that the drill is still a semi end game tool. obvously most people that would be able to make the drill will already be established with a big base. would make no sense to go after creating a drill if u cant protect the resources u farmed.  all i was saying is we need something that even a new player can obtain within hr just like hatcheting doors in rust. ,hurtworld,d5l0cl4,2,t5_36l7m

10060466,0,t1_dbiw053,I do understand why they wouldnt put it on a sale though. In their planning they are in the middle of making a game breaking update so making new players play a few weeks just to crash  off all the servers on the update release would be kind of mean to the new players.,hurtworld,dbiwinc,2,t5_36l7m
