8790555,0,t3_50hyxx,Id add to the list Jay treating the show as family therapy time. Why would you have Dave Attell in studio AND your preteen daughter? Daves one of the best dirty comics working it just doesnt fit. And jay incessantly bitching about his relationship w Christine makes me cringe sometimes its like listening to a shitty couple that just got done fighting every time you see them. Meh is the mood when I hear the show now. I havent listened live in a memorable while ,TheBonfire,d74hu0k,14,t5_39b5y
