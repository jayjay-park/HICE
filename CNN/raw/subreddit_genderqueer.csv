Theyve always known that Im very queer and feminine and thought that was cute but they were still a bit shocked when I came out to them a few weeks ago. One is at least a little bi and has had relationships with women in the past. The other one is not attracted to women at all but swears he is attracted to me and that wont change no matter what happens with my body. Im not sure I believe them but thats just my low self esteem and anxiety talking. They have been trying hard to be super supportive.

3055764,0,t1_coek4p4,Ive learned a lot from them by asking questions. Hoestly I didnt have the slightest clue this community existed and they told me all the different types of being genderqueer and Im really happy to be more informed now.It never crossed my mind that they may have been this way their whole lives. Obviously sexual orientation is not a choice and I dont want to even mention how angry I get when people say otherwise caugh Republicans nutjobs caugh but I never thought much about gender identity. It makes me really happy to know that there is something for everyone even if all groups may not receive the support they deserve... at least yet.Im pretty cufused about my situation. They are a huge feminist but they wants to be a model housewife and raise kids more than anything else which I love about them very much. For the most part they dresses feminine although far far from the typical white girl. I just didnt see this coming and its something I may have to spend the rest of my life dealing with if all goes well which we hope it will. So yes I am confused about this but as you said I am trying to approach this with an open mind. As long as they remain who they are and my personal wants for a partner are being met I see no problem.One question I have and pardon if I seem misinformed and therefore rude but does gender orientation have any link to sexual orientation? They say they are not attracted to women and even if they were bi I would have no problem with that but is there any link between the two? They didnt tell me about the gender identity until very recently and perhaps might be holding back about sexual identity as well.

Masculinity and femininity when you take away the things that actually arent gendered characteristics at all and are thus improperly assigned by much of society to such categories are frankly nasty oppressive piles of shit.gtIf I dont want to be a man or woman why do I have to be? The only thing gendered about me is the tags on my clothes and why should I let that determine who I am? I am me whoever I want to be! If I want to grow out my hair why cant I? Im not a man. If I want to wear bright colors why cant I? If I want to dress punk rock one day and indie hipster the next why cant I? I am not a man. I am not a woman.Even if you were a man or a woman who gives a fuck.  Its so bizarre when you look beneath the surface of people puffing up and reveal their crippling anxiety about what society thinks of them.  Fuckedup ignorant stupidass society.

3374711,0,t3_2ytvb8,Im MAAB and I dont know if I really qualify as genderfluid Im just not quite sure yet what I am but heres my perspective. I dont know if I would phrase it as my gender changes since its really a sort of gradual modular thing. Different aspects of how I experience gender dont necessarily align at any given point. But to give you a concrete example a few days ago I painted my toenails pink. Next day I woke up looked at my feet and was totally stoked. I felt feminine I thought it looked great it felt so natural and like such a part of me. One day later I was changing my socks before going out and seeing it it seemed totally weird and alien. I couldnt understand anymore why Id done that. I was tempted to get the nail polish remover and wash it off. However knowing how this oscillates for me I resisted that urge. And now another day later it seems totally awesome again. I know this is just an aspect of gender presentation or performance but I think it illustrates well how this feels for me daytoday. Some days I feel so feminine that I halfseriously research what it would take to get HRT and the next day the very thought seems completely absurd and Im sure that Im a man. It kind of sucks. I hope my gender identity will stabilize a bit at some point. I just relatively recently rediscovered and fully acknowledged my gendernonconformity maybe thats part of why its so wild right now.,genderqueer,cpcxx5p,2,t5_2r1c3

3532552,0,t3_30mjsc,If youre comfortable not having tight fabric to keep your boobs in place but youre concerned about showing nipples there are reusable silicone things that stick to the nipples and keep them smooth. This way you have the appearance of not showing your nipples and the protection of your nipples from fabric rubbing them and none of the wires and straps that bras have. like thisOf course with those sticky things your boobs will still be able to move but maybe theyll look more professional. I think that your breasts are going to move unless you wear something very tight to keep them in place which is going to basically be a bra or a binder. maybe by another name.

It can be weird to stay grey especially when confronting new intimate things like anal pegging crossdressing etc. Not having a solid identity can really make me insecure when facing new things. So on top of your gf probably not wanting to pressure you and fetishize you she also just lost being normal hetero. I am glad you are going slow talking experimenting and googling forums are what I would do too and I wish you two luck OP.edit oh an idea you should affirm her and her you with lots of whatever you are I love you lots as who you are and things like that in addition to being very open with each other.

5051192,0,t3_3jza0h,Short answer No.I think life is a journey rather than an end point. Its very possible that your identify as your gender today might not be the same in the future whether it is a year or decades from now. But what you decide is likely what works for you in this period of time however long that lasts.Ive met a range of people some who were in a process of defining themselves. Some were unsure but exploring. Some started out transitioning then realized that they were happy within this transitional space and didnt need to continue to their original goal. Some knew it was temporary and were content with deciding to postpone their decision. And others just flat out knew what they were and went all out. I think it is somewhat based on personality as well. Some people are just very decisive about everything others prefer to be more fluid and adaptable and others do whatever feels right to them. There really isnt a single approach.I see gender and orientation as separate but similar experiences in how we define ourselves. Society constructs and values change as we age where relocate as well as by generation. There is pressure from the societal construct as well as serendipitous events. Some people later in life in their forties fifties sixities came out as gay as their society became more accepting and less dangerous surrounding orientation and gender expression. Ive also met gay people who later came out as bisexual for similar reasons bisexual was considered a phase you passed through on the way to accepting that you were gay it was not a permanent orientation. You were dismissed as holding onto the closet. Sometimes people realize that they werent in the orientation they thought they were because they fell in love with someone outside it. It was perfectly chance that they met the person. I dont think that necessarily changes your orientation like you switch from one to another but it makes me realize that things arent so rigidly defined as we pretend they are.,genderqueer,cuuuz34,1,t5_2r1c3

5146504,0,t3_3lddy1,Other people have given broad answers in general.  Ill answer for how it applies to me. To me being genderqueer means not fitting fully or easily into the labels or social constructs of gender that were forced on me by society.  I was born and raised male and I still look mostly male most people describe me like a slightly more feminine than average male and Im comfortable with people using male language or pronouns to refer to me.  I dont identify as female nor do I present myself as such nor do I want to at least beyond a certain point which is usually partial andor temporary so I dont identify as transgendered but I do find that I share a lot of things in common with transgendered people like when I hear them talk about their experiences there are lots of things where I think Wow I have had that same exact experience  feel the same way.  Im also comfortable with people using female language or pronouns to refer to me but people dont do this very often. There is a difference between the terms.  I think genderqueer fits me more than genderfluid although there are aspects of genderfluidity that also seem to resonate with me I dont feel the term fits as much as genderqueer.  I think genderfluid emphasizes the changing nature of a persons gender expression or identity whereas genderqueer emphasizes the queerness i.e. the way it is weird odd or strange.  I feel like for me genderqueer is a powerful word because it reclaims the negative connotations associated with weirdness...which is important to me because I was bullied a lot as a kid often for breaking norms both gender norms and other norms. I only discovered my gender identity recently.  I think it was a matter of reading and hearing the word genderqueer enough and researching it enough to realize that it fit with my experience and identity.  I had some strong tendencies to want to cross gender norms as a kid such as wanting to wear dresses and skirts or patterns that were for girls but these were pretty strongly suppressed by how I was treated.  I also never felt fully transgendered and Ive come to really love and accept my body.  However I dont love or accept the social norms and socialization that was forced on me growing up as a male and that continues to be forced on me when people respond to me in stereotypical ways associated with maleness that I dont want and dont consent to and usually dont even get to discuss before they come up.  I also have no desire to participate in allmale spaces and often feel great discomfort in them. I also recall as a kid feeling frustrated when I had to fill out forms and choose male or female. My identity affects my day to day life hugely and always has even before I had a word to put to it.  But the label honestly doesnt really affect me much more than just giving me a name or term with which to discuss it and find communities of people online or in person who can be supportive of me and share their own stories struggles or insights.  But I think about gender a lot.  Most of the people I interact with especially the men are strongly differentiated into the gender binary.  I find myself very consciously aware of being one of a few people to cross certain social norms.  I also struggle with figuring out how to interact with people socially the way I most want to given that most people seem to perceive me as unambiguously male and then bring a whole series of expectations to interactions with me many of which are strongly in conflict with who I really am what I really think feel want etc.I could get into more specifics if you have questions about any of this!,genderqueer,cv6chxa,1,t5_2r1c3

It is well written and seems to have all of the information one would need to understand your situation.I do not know if this is the kind of feedback you are interested in but I have a couple minor suggestions. Firstly your second last sentence is missing a period. Like I said minor. P  Secondly I noticed that your sentence length is a little long around  words on average. I have heard that  to  words is a good average length for sentences. I find people tend to write larger sentences when they are trying to explain things using a lot of information. You write well so it is not a huge problem. However I do not know how familiar your audience is with LGBT topics so you may be introducing a lot of new terminology they may not be familiar with.  If this is the case a sentence containing the terms traditional narrative trans person and umbrella term that is  words long may be a bit much for them. But as I mentioned before this is a minor quibble I have. You probably want to post this soon if you have not already so feel free to just go for it.,genderqueer,cvw7pu0,1,t5_2r1c3

5665375,0,t3_3snym1,I also dont feel very strongly about pronouns Im comfortable with hehim and sheher although I have come to actually prefer theythem like I dont take offense if people dont use my preferred pronouns. And I do find that there is some work in using neutral pronouns and in particular it feels like an imposition on others to ask them to use them.  Its also often a lot of work on my part with new people I have to explain why sometimes provide some justification if they react negatively etc.  So a lot of the time I dont bring it up.I think you can be genderqueer though even if you a dont care about pronouns at all or b actively prefer the pronouns associated with your birth sex.  Pronouns are just one of many aspects of gender identity.  For some people they are a key or important one for others they are a small part and for others they are irrelevant or inconsequential.  This doesnt make your identity any less valid.Like for me when I think of my gender identity the parts that I feel are most critical  key for me are social interactions surrounding dating relationships and sexuality. The assumptions that people make about me on the basis of their perceiving me as male have led to a whole serious of toxic interactions. Like Ive had my maleness used as justification for sexual assault Guys always want sex so his saying no and trying to push me away must mean he is just trying to be polite or not come across too pushy as well as labeling me as creepy or a predator in cases where I express interest in someone who doesnt like me back even when I was acting in a way that I and all of my friends have told me is completely respectful.  So when I think about pronouns it seems almost trivial relative to these things.But...heres the big but. I think pronouns can challenge people can change how people think.  I noticed this first in myself when I started wrestling with using other peoples pronouns when they werent intuitive to me like interacting with trans people who looked more like their assigned birth sex to me than their true gender identity.  It was a challenge to me but when I wrestled with it enough I was able to start seeing peoples actual gender identity...and I find that this then changed how I saw myself and thought about myself and also how I interacted with them because I think gender identity can relate to how people want to be interacted with.So like...if my asking someone to refer to me with theythem pronouns can challenge how they think then thats great.  Maybe it wont help me but itll help someone else for whom pronouns are more important.  Or maybe it would help me. Maybe it will challenge someone to see my true gender identity and maybe that will lead them to be less likely to make assumptions that overstep boundaries for me or actually harm me or harm themI think some people have felt unnecessary fear or nervousness around me on the basis of them labeling me as male.  Who knows maybe if I had started identifying openly as genderqueer andor nonbinary earlier in life maybe it would have prevented being sexually assaulted. Maybe it would have prevented being labeled as a predator or creep by someone who had no actual need to be afraid of me.I know this is a lot to think of. Pronouns are just one little social signal...theyre not just for you but theyre also for other people.  If your life is working great for you with sheher pronouns then awesome. My life wasnt especially when it came to dating relationships and sexuality. The pronouns arent a big factor for me but they are a factor. And I do feel more empowered with theythem pronouns.I hope this makes some sense I always would love to clarify more or talk more about this if you have any more questions!,genderqueer,cwzcfer,5,t5_2r1c3

I agree that a mistrust or hostility towards men is understandable in that scenario but I think that a better approach might be for oneonone counseling to be the appropriate course until someone feels prepared to be in mixed company as one always is everywhere else in life. Group counseling then could be a baby step towards mixed socialization.

I plan on contacting them about how to get a more accurate measurement for my needs but thatll be something you should consider so you arent discouraged by a similar problem.

7743427,0,t3_4ld53v,I amab was exactly like you in the beginning. I was so anxious antisocial and awkward. I also realized that the way I feel about my body is kind of different but I couldnt really describe it. I repressed my real self for my whole life because I thought that I would be ridiculed and I didnt even know how to become like myself more. But during the last year my panic attacks became worse so I decided to do something and started to embrace myself more. I now identify as genderqueer agender but still catch me wondering if Im trans from time to time just like you. Id say that you shouldnt worry too much about your gender. It is not that important gender is just a label that society knows in what drawer you fit in. If you feel more comfortable male then there is nothing wrong with that. Do what makes you happy dont think about it too much and try not to put pressure on yourself. Gender can fluctuate and you have your whole life to figure yourself out.I hope everything turns out well for you. Also you are pretty handsome in that picture ,genderqueer,d3mddqy,3,t5_2r1c3
7809373,0,t3_4m8er8,Thanks for sharing here!I agree that what you describe your one friend saying seems dismissive.I really dislike when people ask questions like Are you sure it isnt because blahblahblah?  Like I personally think that this is an irrelevant question and the way these sorts of questions are framed they imply this idea that If your gender identity is influenced by your environment in some way then its not valid.  This is ridiculous.  I think everyones gender identity is influenced by their environment because the different categories for gender are themselves social constructs!So I think you are right that this sort of thing is dismissive and that someone who reacted this way is probably not be the best person to talk to about these things.  I think though that if you want for the future to have a confident and assertive response when talking to someone like this you might want to actually brainstorm ways in which being in a predominantly male environment may have contributed positive things to your experience of gender and to your gender identity.  This isnt necessarily a bad thing at all.For example I am AMAB but I think that the fact that I had a lot of strong role models both adults and peers when growing up of girls and women who deviated from traditional gender norms helped in forming the female component of my identity.  I didnt choose my birth sex and as a kid I was acutely aware of this and I felt this sense of identifying with people independently of their sex.  I especially identified with women and girls who struggled with coercive gender norms andor broke them or expressed desires to break them.  So for example a lot of my friends growing up were girls who were into math science and computers.  I definitely think this contributed to my gender identity.The other friend you talk to also doesnt sound helpful at all.  No one can tell you what your identity is so if someone says you are definitely a girl theyre making a claim that theyre not in a position to make.  I think that anyone who would make a statement like that especially in response to someone expressing that they are questioning their gender identity  or are not sure how they feel about their own gender or about gender in general...to make a statement like that shows a lack of understanding of how gender identity works.  Gender identity is your own internal sense of gender.  So for someone to say Youre definitely a guy. to me in response to something like that would seem absurd a little like me saying I feel hungry. and then the other person saying No you dont.  Actually youre not hungry at all.I hope you can find this helpful.  I dont know exactly where you could go in your life...but...I do find that thinking about things in the ways I described helps me feel more empowered and confident about my own gender identity and more confident and assertive when people act dismissively of it.Another thing I find helpful is that you dont need to have your own gender fully figured out in order to make a confident statement about it.  For example you might not feel confident about what your gender identity is but you might feel confident making a statement like I feel confused or uncertain about my gender identity. And you might be  confident in that statement even if your confidence in a particular identity is low.  Similarly you might like me feel something like I feel  confident that the genderqueer label technically fits or applies to me but Im not  sure that I want to use it in all settings because it doesnt always communicate exactly what I want to about my gender.  Another thing that I feel would be this statement I feel  confident that Im nonbinary in that I dont identify as fully male or fully female but I dont feel  confident in any more exact or full description of my gender identity.   Basically you dont have to have it all figured out.  I like labels like genderqueer and nonbinary because theyre very broad and inclusive.,genderqueer,d3tu5hx,5,t5_2r1c3

8035980,0,t3_4pa23o,Ive heard some nonbinary people express taking offense at this sort of usage of the singular they and Ive especially heard them object when cis people change their pronouns to they on Facebook or ask people in person to refer to them in this way.  I strongly disagree with this viewpoint on the following grounds Singular they has been in use for a very long time hundreds of years and is in common use in daily speech. I think using singular they in everyday speech more often normalizes it and makes it more familiar and easier to use for all people thus helping nonbinary people who ask for it as their preferred pronouns. I think there are strong grounds for a theythem by default approach to pronouns.  Most cis people have not explicitly specified that they want to be referred to in a certain way.  This is an example of cisnormativityin our society everyone is assumed to be cis by default by most people.  But there are closetedstealth trans people passing trans people and also nonbinary people who pass as one gender or the other.  So I think any casual use of this pronoun more is moving just a bit in this direction. There are also solid ideological grounds for preferring or using genderneutral pronouns like such pronouns were advocated by feminism long before people became open about nonbinary gender identities.  People of any gender including cis people can prefer neutral pronouns on ideological grounds and not just their own abstract ideology but as a way of reducing the influence of gender roles which may negatively impact them directly.  So I think you also help support these people indirectly just a little and support breaking down gender roles when you use this pronoun.So I wouldnt worry about your wifes usage of they here.  I suspect most people probably wouldnt even notice it.  And Id say such casual use actually indirectly helps nonbinary people who prefer they as their pronoun in small ways.  And Id go farther to say I also support cis people who have decided they prefer they for ideological reasons rather than reasons of gender identity.,genderqueer,d4jbif5,13,t5_2r1c3
8049249,0,t3_4pgx18,So the thing that most people here will probably tell you is that both sadly and luckily we cant tell you what you really are  thats up to you to decide. We can tell you that your experience is similar to ours or that its reminiscent of this or that experience but we cant really say welp sounds like youre an X.That being said the time you spend thinking about this is a strong indicator that youre probably not cis. With maybe the exception of cis people who have TOCD  I dont know much about it but due to obsessive experiences Im hesitant to say if you spend a lot of time worrying about being X you WITHOUT A DOUBT ARE X  people who spend a lot of time thinking about being trans seeking out trans resources think about transition ask other trans people how they seem to them etc. are trans a lot of the time.Now you dont want to label yourself yet and seem okay with doing so so I think that takes a lot of pressure off your shoulders. I think talking to your therapist might be a good idea if you know that they are knowledgable with trans things. If youre not sure about that you might talk to them about something a friend is going through at first like my friend is nonbinarya trans guy what can I do to help himthem and then see if your therapist gives BS advice or stuff that sounds legit.For what you can do to feel more comfy with yourself I think you can employ those strategies youve already listed make you feel better  talking in a deeper voice wearing baggy clothings etc. You might want to try nonpermanent ways to adopt a more conventionally masculine appearance such as contouring your face to make it more angular or voice deepening exercises although those can damage or alter your vocal chords so be careful and dont overdo it there are some tutorials over the web for those.Also if you want to maybe some people here could do some short writeups about you calling you a guy or nonbinary and using different pronouns for you or you could ask a trusted friend to do that and see how you feel about it.

And since how masc or femme I want to present on any given day varies doing that would just be swapping one nonconstant source of mild dysphoria for another with the added bonus of there being no guarantee what specific gender traits the hormones would give me.Which leaves me with the option of binders hard to source for a plus size body with extremely large breasts and uncomfortable when my sensory issues sometimes make jeans waistbands too much for me to handle.  At the moment pretty much my only overtly genderqueer presentation is that I almost never wear makeup again sensory issues and dont shave any of my hair.

8647830,0,t3_4y37yf,I do think nonbinary is different from female and male identities in a lot of ways.  One way its different is that there is no longstanding existing category of nonbinary.  But also because nonbinary is a broad umbrella category you find a fullrange of appearances within it.  You find AFAB people who are femalepresenting and malepresenting and similarly you find AMAB people who are femalepresenting and malepresenting.  And then there are people whose presentation is somewhere in the middle or even off the spectrum.   So like...even as you do get exposed to more and more nonbinary people and you start to get a mental picture of what nonbinary looks like its all over the map.  And that makes sense because nonbinary isnt about how you look its about how you feel internally.And I think because of this it is never going to have the same effect as saying that you identify as male or as female.I think thats okay too.  Its a different thing.  I think I actually like the label nonbinary specifically because of its broadness.  Its like I can say it confidently whether Im dressed in all mens clothes at the moment or whether Im wearing a dress and carrying a purse.gt But I also dont really feel compelled to take hormones... I think because Im ok with my own actual body for the most part... its just how people perceive amp act towards me that is weird.This is very much how I feel about my body and my gender.  There are definitely a lot of nonbinary people who do feel a lot of body dysphoria and who want to make changes to their body through hormones or other means.  And I totally support these people!But Im not like this personally.  I like my body asis when Ive experienced body dysphoria its been relatively minor and Ive been able to effectively deal with it mentally without changing anything about my body.  On the other hand the social stuff the way I am treated because of my perceived maleness and the ways in which I am included or excluded from certain groups or certain lines of reasoning that people apply to me can be annoying frustrating even outright toxic.So yeah!  I really get this.  Gender is a social thing...it shapes so much of our experience...people treat people soooo differently based on their perceived gender and we also get socialized differently which then itself feeds into different treatment.  Its super complex!  And I feel like for me most of my tension with gender lives in this social realm how people interact with me and with each other!  So yeah!I definitely feel you on this!,genderqueer,d6ml9nl,1,t5_2r1c3
8658183,0,t1_d6mpdfa,Yeah I really want this to be the case. I had a similar mentality to him but I do understand that people with similar feelings and experiences want to have a codeword that will identify them to others. Race is something ascribed to us with despite Obama being our first mixed race president hes often credited as the first black president because of how Americas perception works but it is also because of similar cultural values gives a platform of understanding. I dont think its a bad idea to be proud of being a race. Thats one thing that makes me feel kinda sad for people who are white american because they dont have a cultural identity that they can be proud of without it being a negative thing. But thats another story. I digress... The whole thing is that I dont feel like naming a shared frustration with a mismatch in assigned gender and true nature which is only really a problem because some people take the label of male and female as more than just the scientific definition of contributor and receiver of genetic material with notable exceptions such as intersexed people is such a bad idea. How else do we communicate how we feel? Words. And this word gives some people a shorter easier way to identify people who are similarly frustrated and reject rigid gender role notions. Instead of having to explain the entirety of what I just did here I could just say genderqueer and say thats a part of me but obviously like any other label its not all of me. I just dont get the sheer aversion to it. ,genderqueer,d6nvze9,1,t5_2r1c3
8914793,0,t3_52clbi,Im pretty sure youre not doing it wrong. But my experience with most people is that they dont often get the hint or ignore it. Sometimes with things like this you might need to outright bring it up. As for the binder she may not be familiar with what they are if they dont have experience with it. And some may wait for you to bring it up instead. My current therapist is with Chase brexton a Maryland based medical group. They are more experienced with gender issues in general but Im not sure my therapist even specializes in it at all. But of course Ive got bigger issues than my gender at the moment. Something not at all uncommon with the lgbt community. Im sure plenty of us would be happy to answer questions if you want. ,genderqueer,d7jfecm,2,t5_2r1c3

And through voice training even the lowest bass can hit the female register. As for the breasts everybodys body is different and reacts to HRT in a different way.

9324674,0,t3_583zx1,I dont know how this relates to gender theory but I spent a long time trying to live up to the gender roles and expectations that go with my assigned sex and getting internal pushback from inside myself. I went through my wedding day with more dissociation nausea and confusion than I did when I was raped. I love my husband and my family it was the act of performing a strongly sterotypical feminine role that set it all off. Pregnancy was horrifying. My body should fundementally not be capable of that and the whole time I had my desire for a child warring with my inability to viscerally comprehend what was happening to my body.  At the time I had no idea that nonbinary identities were a thing or that I might be anything other than a woman. I had to choose between abortion and suicide.I mention this because your questions seem to imply that gender is a light inconsequential choice that someone makes and it really isnt.  ,genderqueer,d8xyz2y,6,t5_2r1c3

9451226,0,t3_5a685e,I mean the gender neutral word for brother or sister is sibling but that sounds a little awkward in a greeting I admit. Some nonbinary people also like sib like sis or bro but not many people know that word. I usually just try to stick to something like hey folks.As for dysphoria its already been explained that its different for everyone. For me its mainly social and bottom dysphoria that fluctuates between barely there and oh god please kill me. It can also be very confusing because my ideal presentation is an androgynous base that can be recognized as completely male or completely female depending on how I choose to present. Of course thats sadly a very unrealistic goal at the moment and probably wouldnt be very appreciated at my workplace as well. But that cant be generalized to the whole nonbinary population of the world just like binary trans people can have different transition goals and sources of dysphoria as well some only want HRT some want HRT and surgeries some dont want to do anything medical or are unable to some just want some surgeries but not others some arent sure at all ....Also I know thats not part of your question but I wouldnt really say binary trans people I really hate calling people binary because the idea of a binary being a thing is iffy in and of itself but there really is a lack of a better term are privileged over nonbinary people per se. I definitely would say I am privileged over especially binary trans women and nonbinary transfeminine people as well because I can go outside at night presenting like I want to with very minimal risk of harassment or physical violence while a lot of transfeminine people dont have that privilege sadly. It depends a lot on factors like birth assignment race class where one lives... There are different axes to it like nonbinary identities often being cast aside as madeup or invalid but its not like every binary trans person doesnt experience invalidation of their gender identity. Its just different.Im glad youre asking questions and taking a stance for nonbinary people though! The rift in the community can be very aggravating. Just by staying informed and open youre already doing a lot and its definitely appreciated! ,genderqueer,d9e0cqn,11,t5_2r1c3

9812383,0,t1_dam7vgx,Ill start with this then.If theyre questioning their gender and arent quite sure what they are so theyve told you they feel that way what youve wrote is okay. However if theyve said this is how they identify or theyre quite sure theyre both genders or however theyve explained it its appropriate to say that they are that way instead of feeling that way. Otherwise youre saying that theyre an X that feels like a Y which implies they arent really a Y. This may not be your intention but it is easily interpreted that way.If youre worried about saying or doing something stupid dont be afraid to ask them. This is especially true when it comes to physical intimacy whether this is sex or something else. Nonbinary and transgender people often have attitudes and issues about their body that others dont have. Until you get to know them better its best not to assume theyll react the way people of their birth sex usually do.,genderqueer,daml439,4,t5_2r1c3
