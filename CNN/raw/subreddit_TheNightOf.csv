Not particularly great and the main cast are absolutely horrible at their jobs as investigators but its in the murder mystery genre.Id also highly recommend watching making of a murderer.

8240024,0,t3_4prd77,I think Naz killed her.The girls mood is beyond strange lives in the brownstones when naz says you know do what everyone else wants you to do she responds no I really dont. The transporting somewhere else when something bad happens makes me think she is somewhat sucidal. Seems like a girl with everything wealthy attractive but never is  happysmiles very somber mood obv involved somewhat heavily with drugs. I think she was suicidal saw naz liked her so he could be easily manipulated obv liked pain it turned her on convinced naz to stab her in bed and he just listened like beforewasnt at full mental capacity. I believe the show will show how people like to believe someone is innocent even when their is overwhelming evidence is stacked against them. Every person right now are playing detective thinking of who else could have done it when the answer is actually right in front of you.I also believe it will play on the stereotype that all cops are corruptshady. When his lawyer hears Box is on the case he is visibly upset more upset then when he finds out the girl was murdered I believe this is because he knows Box plays by the rules follows proper protocol. Everyone automatically assume cops are shadydo unethical things but are willing to take far bigger leaps of faith to believe naz is innocent. ,TheNightOf,d57k556,18,t5_3estg

8277314,0,t3_4socid,I actually have a similar theory as well. Although I do think your clip isnt reliable enough to form a conclusion. After watching the episode a second time the hearse scene really struck out as the most suspicious. The scene focuses heavily on the camera footage from inside and out of the gas station. Could this end up actually turning into Nhazs favor? The Hearse character just felt like he had an agenda. A preemptive motivation if you will. Obviously this is all a hunch and we simply dont have enough information yet.

The only reason why the show doesnt explain who did it right away is to keep you wondering if Naz is believable or not and thus more able to identify with characters who think he did it. If we knew right away who did it the detective and DA would look like jackasses the whole way through.

Sarcasm is an art form. Funny thing is you dont realize how rushed inpatient and uncaring you become until you spend time away from The City.  I remember one time at lunch this lady tried to jaywalk and was hit by a cab.  A few people stopped to see if she was dead but it barely registered for most people.Two things that just fascinate me about large cities is the intersection of so many deep communities.  Take an aspiring actor a signed model a corporate attorney a bartender a hedge fund trader a cop and a taxi driver.  Each has this unique life friends work parties clubs vacations that you could write volumes on and you literally pass one of each person walking down any old street in Manhattan.The second thing thats fascinating is the concentration of wealth.

Scene w Nas and Andrea on sidewalk the audience is captivated either by Nasirs body language reactions expressions as everyone was trying to TrueDetective the shit out of this show to no avail. Upon rewatching this scene everyone then focused on CaveManStabby aka Duane Reade. IS THAT A CURSE OR WHAT?!?!    Scene w Trevor amp Box Sure were all rolling our eyes at Trevors post Islamophobic comments but lets be honest  we were all trying to study and observe Sgt. Box. I know he was always the more commanding actor of the two when they shared screen time at least in my opinion.    Scene w ProsecutionD.A.s office I think shes assistant D.A. I dont really care shes crazy and ugly and amazingly portrayed in this series as everyone could not shut up about how distracting she was. Almost everything about her screams fake.

8760803,0,t3_502uxv,Why is there so much uncertainty among viewers regarding Rays the CPAs guilt? Ray and Andrea get in an argument and break up that night which is on camera. He called her multiple times in a row afterwards and she didnt answer. This is why he went to her house. Box made a comment to Ray about how he knows Ray didnt go home immediately afterwards because his cell phone pinged. Read between the lines Ray went to Andreas that night. Then Box says ...and Ill find the knife. aka I know you did it motherfucker. ,TheNightOf,d70revy,25,t5_3estg

8762176,0,t1_d70quhl,gt why are we so sure it wasnt naz...Well we as the viewer actually see him wake up in the kitchen without any blood on him and there would be a whole lot if he was the killer.  And CPA guy threw a knife away in the footage.  ,TheNightOf,d70xlux,4,t5_3estg

8762812,0,t3_502uxv,Overall pretty solid ending. The story is told more through the characters than through what actually happened and I feel like I dont really need the closure so many are asking for. We got to see the true underlying intentions and standpoints each character has underneath Freddy genuinely caring about his unicorn despite all the suspicion. He cared so much he may as well have snuffed out the scent of innocence with his own embrace. He must know he also changed Nazs lifefor better or worse. Box being notably disturbed by the idea of the cop who doesnt give a shit show and that being something people can enjoy...it awakens something in him. He cant NOT see this through the way his reputation precedes him to. Stone serious applause for Torturro realizing he wont get by on the eczema with BS medications this guy or that guy says but that when he has a friend around like the cat or when he genuinely believes in himself the stress goes down enough that the eczema eases down. Hell even Weis is noticeably undone by her own judgment on the case mid closing argument. You can sense disbelief in her voice her body language even her face.Chandra fucking sucks and thats about all I have to say about her. She got what she deserved and she wouldve worsened Nazs situation way more had Freddy decided it to be so he definitely had the tape footage. You have to ask yourself where the writers drew the line between her being a character vs. her being an arrogant dumbfuck plot device that serves only to get Stone that beautiful speech at the end. Dumb. The last scenes were fantastic especially the eye to eye between Naz and Andrea in the past. Really worked in more ways than one felt like a painting if anything.

BUT! late Sunday night as I checked the news one last time before lamentably going to bed first day of classes today...simply tons of praise pouring in for the final ep of Night Of and not a single spoiler. I even scrolled thru the infamous Vulture and AV Club reviews headings and...only vague but impassioned praise for John Turturro.

8777494,0,t3_502uxv,The scene at the casino bar was one of my favorites in the finale. Box is exceptional in his abilities as a detective and seems so satisfied after he tells Ray to get the fuck out of there. Its the only time we see him satisfied since his retirement.
