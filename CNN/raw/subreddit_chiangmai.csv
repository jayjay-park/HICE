5954898,0,t1_cwzvpk7,I think learning a language needs to also be interesting for its own sake. I personally struggle with the motivation because its a ton of hard work and I cant seem to justify it. It seems like a waste of effort if Im only staying in a country for a few months or years. But in reality theres no way to measure the utility of learning a new language. It opens you up to countless new friendships and experiences which you could never predict. Like they say learn a new language gain a new soul.,chiangmai,cy07ud3,1,t5_2sd4a
