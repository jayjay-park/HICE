3950372,0,t1_cr6js4f,MathMLs support is poor and Google chrome is dropping it completely citing of usage. That is understandable  the only real usage for MathML is having another software likely Javascript and having the user enter it through some sort of gui interface. Then for the user they dont really see and care about what is behind the gui and for all they care they want the software render it into an image for its consistent better visual appearance. As such how would MathML being adopted? If WC adopt a latex subset in place of MathML I bet the usage pattern will reverse. On the hand WC will not adopt anything unless there is already implementation. So with my question I am hoping browsers to answer Meanwhile I am not really advocating each browser to invent their own latex equation engine the situation today with MathML. I was thinking about third party library support just as how video codec is being developed and used. But third party library for latex equation is not going to happen because as is now TeX is a language it will have infinite amount of corner cases ask any programmer who debugs and the only solution to support full TeX is to write a complete TeX and importing all the macro packages. No one will ever try that. Therefore I think to attack the issue at its core we need downgrade TeX from a language into a mark up and then standardize into a subset of features.,LaTeX,cr6krae,1,t5_2qhbn

So go to CUsersyournamehereAppDataLocalMikTeX.. Create a directory called texlatexdeedyresume. Copy the .cls and other style files to this directory.Go back to MikTeX gt Maintenance gt Settings.  Click on Refresh FNDB. Go to LyX gt Tools gt Reconfigure. Restart LyX. Check to make sure the new class files are loaded by going to LyX gt Tools gt TeX Information.
