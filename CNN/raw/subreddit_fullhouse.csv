6731030,0,t1_d0eqtd8,That bugged me as well. The rest of the house seemed mostly fine in layout  especially when you consider renovations could have been done  but the attic makes no sense. The twins room was never huge but was better than the space they showed Ramona.,fullhouse,d0fjq42,16,t5_2txj3
6732073,0,t1_d0fira1,Seems like she bends to the paycheque. But she doesnt hold back on The View when it comes to speaking out against homosexual marriage. ,fullhouse,d0fnlp0,8,t5_2txj3

6736354,0,t1_d0fnwf2,Well Candace DJ was on Dancing with the Stars so Id say there is no surprise there. There were several times in the season where she busted out her DWTS moves. ,fullhouse,d0g3im8,11,t5_2txj3
6739924,0,t3_47uayt,Addiction is a real thing. Ive seen it secondhandsibling and its a hard place to get out of. Its admirable that she has been able to overcome and seems to be happy healthy and thriving. No judgement here. ,fullhouse,d0ggsew,3,t5_2txj3
6740140,0,t1_d0g3xp6,Regardless of critics this show deserves a season two I absolutely loved season one. Same with Arrested Development. ,fullhouse,d0ghlcl,5,t5_2txj3
6746769,0,t1_d0g6xnq,Jackson did mention that he only sees Ramona once a year so Im assuming they lived a little further away.,fullhouse,d0h67yl,12,t5_2txj3
6757479,0,t3_482l5o,Eh Im not particularly loving any of the kids yet but I dont hate any of them. I just dont think any of them are as cute as the girls were as kids. Hopefully there will be a second season so they will have a chance to grow on me a bit more. Its probably noteworthy to say I am not a kid person in general so they need to be pretty over the top adorable to get me rooting for themI must say though that I thoroughly enjoyed Maxs line about Grandpa teaching him how to remove stains.  ,fullhouse,d0ia363,2,t5_2txj3
6759607,0,t1_d0icvu0,If I remember correctly the master bedroom has its on bathroom. Didnt DJ and Steph drop Dannys wedding ring down the drain in there?,fullhouse,d0ii0ai,4,t5_2txj3

6770769,0,t1_d0htdv6,I couldnt agree more. Matt is Stephs boyfriend type. Not DJ.  Besides it seems like Matt and Steph just have a physical relationship and not a deep relationship like DJ and Steve.Also they never really showed Matt playing with the kids. Plus I feel like Steve wouldve just let Jackson buy the jersey and not pay him back. Just a side thought.,fullhouse,d0jqxk9,2,t5_2txj3

9940340,0,t1_db38cn4,Sorry I phrased that poorly.Youre inventing a problem that no one has to legitimize the problem you have because you perceive anything that is contrary to your preconceptions and the norms of your own life as a direct attack on your beliefs and sensibilities which the inclusion of diversity is intended to help normalize to people who might not see much of what the world is like outside their own bubble.,fullhouse,db391z9,7,t5_2txj3
9948231,0,t1_db45l2q,Thats just hid acting  hes a kid hes overplaying it  and that kinda contributes to the I really wish Max would shut up now feeling I had during his scenes.I have to say the character had some nice moments with the Rose thing and with Fernando he was used pretty good as a bridge character to make Fernando seem more part of the family as it shows he really does care for everyone.,fullhouse,db4a39t,7,t5_2txj3
