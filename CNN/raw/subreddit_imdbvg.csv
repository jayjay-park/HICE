Think Im near the end since I got a trophy for scanning every dino though theres still a ton of other stuff to do.Ive been binge watching the first two seasons of Bates Motel. Its good but it could have been great. It should have been like half as many episodes per season just focusing on Normans unravelling and his relationship with Norma. Its brilliant when its about that. But theres too much padding with the brother and the drug war etc. It would have been a much stronger show with all that cut out.,imdbvg,devfcy3,1,t5_3ixag

He has clearly tried to take advantage of that here on reddit as well and I am pleased to see you are not responding well to his trolling. A  Karma says a lot and like Solaris has said before him having a  karma immediately after he posts all but confirms he is using sock accounts to upvote his posts and try to seed out his agenda. If you need any help with any of this feel free to ask me anything. I want this subreddit to be the best that it can be. Harry will likely try to stop that and if you do get rid of him he will be back with a vengeance.,imdbvg,df20st3,1,t5_3ixag

I think the real question is as it was during Obamas presidency is it our commander in chiefs job  our employee  to do what we want or what he said hed do or is it his job to do what his judgement dictates?I think in a representative democracy we should do what the people want as long as it is constitutional but there are some strong arguments against that.So where do you stand Sol is it time to put our battletested yet stretched thin vets back on the ground in the middle east when we are not willing to pay for their health mental or otherwise whilst our infrastructure crumbles and our job skills fall behind or do we let Iran Syria Russia the Saudi crown and ISIS shape the present and future over there?Because those are pretty much our two options  so what say you?,imdbvg,dgkc4om,1,t5_3ixag
