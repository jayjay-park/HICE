3162405,0,t1_coowo2f,The Sony ICF series of radios may be up your alley. I have a Sony ICF  or D and I swear by that thing. Ive had it for years and still works solidly.What you should look out for is a radio that gives you a continuous wavelength range mine goes from  kHz to  kHz and sideband one with USB amp LSB as opposed to SSB would be my preference. As uib mentions see if it has an antenna jack then you can connect an antenna to it e.g. a simple long wire but make sure its grounded.Ill admit that I have little scope with regards to the range of radio makes and models out there but Im more than happy with what I have. But others may want to chime in with their own preferences.Edit Check out this site Ive link to my radio but in the frame on the left there are more Sony radios. Then try this link to see a big list of receivers. Further try here for your first receiver and join up with rshortwave,numberstations,cops5g2,1,t5_2tkgj

7699782,0,t1_d3hbf5n,I dont feel like this is spoiling anything more than the first episode maybe but Ill put this hereThere was a radio tower and a message that was being played on a loop on a particular radio frequency.  During the transmission heard in the clip I posted above there is a series of numbers that are spoken.During the th season of the show there was an episode where an airliner transmits a message and you can hear the LOST numbers playing in response.  Clip hereI wouldnt suggest watching the second clip as it is very spoilery if you want to watch the show.,numberstations,d3hexq8,5,t5_2tkgj

11502557,0,t1_dfzsmi8,No problem. I usually check nearby signals though just out of curiosity and because spies can be sneaky that way. But related to your question the signal that can be seen to the left of the numbers transmission in the Ea video I recorded and did not post in this sub is actually of an unidentified UNID signal that I also recorded Ive been asking around and nobody seems to know what type of signal it is. But we suspect that it is likely coming from the Russians. ,numberstations,dfztcj6,2,t5_2tkgj
