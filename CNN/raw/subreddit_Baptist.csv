Youre coming across super weird about this. Recording conversations with cell phone or note taking just to discuss some church matters with your pastor?,Baptist,cm26gn6,2,t5_2s868
2920214,0,t1_cnyipkg,A few comments earlier you agreed that Scripture has women teaching women.  What Paul says in I Timothy  is clearly not prohibiting women teachers because that is commanded elsewhere...it prohibits women teaching men.  Thats the meaning of usurp which is the key word in that verse.  Women are allowed to teach women and children but not men.  This is the standard complementarian position.  I know Beth Moore agrees with this that she is not supposed to teach men in fact she teaches women to be submissive to their husbands in accordance with Scripture.You really should reserve your condemnation for the plethora of women who think nothing of usurping a male leadership role over anyone who will listen for example this woman and this woman and there are many more.,Baptist,co01cp1,1,t5_2s868
