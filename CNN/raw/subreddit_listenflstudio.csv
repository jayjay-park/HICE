241789,0,t3_1wvqwt,I will say its a bit generic and its got the plastic mainstream vibe going on also watch out for those sytrus saws but I will also say its well produced for being new to FL Studio and a lot better than I ever made when I first started out. It sounds like youve got a quick ear for production. Keep working at it and always seek out ways to hone your skill. Great start.,listenflstudio,cf5tag5,1,t5_2zg76
271371,0,t3_1x1fgs,IMO everything is too loud. The bass is muddy and fighting with the strings. You can always EQ but I find that starting out with a palette of sounds that fit well from the getgo is a much easierbetter way of approaching things. As far as setting levels I suggest grouping your instruments into buses of drumssynthsbassetc and then dropping all of your faders to zero and bring them up in order of importance volume. Then once you have everything sounding good if you decide you want the drums a bit quieter you just drop the drums bus fader. I really like the arrangement of this. You have the songwriting aspect fairly well figured out. ,listenflstudio,cf8vz9r,2,t5_2zg76
342956,0,t3_1xxybi,Aah some beautiful classic uplifting trance. Awesome work my friend i really like it.And did you write this for someone? Cause it definitely has a very happy loving vibe to it. I love the bassline too. I will say a few of the levels sound like theyre falling a little short i think you could get some more volume out of this. But its a great track as it stands. Good work.,listenflstudio,cfgbf1l,2,t5_2zg76
