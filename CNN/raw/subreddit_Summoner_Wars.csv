2633343,0,t3_2q2ouw,Well most of the MUs Match Ups are even enough to be playable and good some factions just take more practice. Yes st Vanguards are considered to be on the weaker side but in the last ios app SW tournament they had the highest win rate. If you dont use the st TO or PE Tundra Orcs Phoenix Elves you should be good to go in most cases.,Summoner_Wars,cn2b8go,1,t5_2unkn
5594346,0,t3_3qpwl0,I started putting together this site back in May but I never found the time to finish it. It has a few previews but the spreadsheet is where it all shines  I even used the exact colours from the sleeves too. The spreadsheet also has two options for two preferences on how you implement clear sleeves. If anyone wants to help me finish this guide theyre more than welcome! The Dek Prot Mini sleeves are perfect in my opinion especially when you factor in price but I will say that the coloured sleeves road is a dangerous one. Some of the sleeves seem to be out of print now and you may also have some unpleasant decisions to make with regards to reusing colours for various reasons. Despite the hours I put into this project I would honestly recommend using all one colour  itll actually enhance the game in some ways ie deck building hiding the mercenaries but Im stubborn enough to keep going down the colour road...This nice person put together a very similar guide but IIRC we disagreed on one or two of the choices. ,Summoner_Wars,cwqj4du,1,t5_2unkn
