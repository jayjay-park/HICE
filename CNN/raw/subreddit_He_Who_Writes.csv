8493612,0,t1_d63917s,Most likely unless we hire someone to take us there faster. Edward says.Nah thats a waste of money. Charles replies. Were here for the adventure! Not to pay someone to ferry us from place to place. This aint no safari.Theres also catching new pokemon. Lori pipes. It will be hard to catch them inside a car.Right right that all makes sense. Rose cuts Lori off before she can say anything else. Point being whats our game plan?Uh how do you mean? I ask. Everyone is looking at Rose as if she knows something we dont.How are we going to go about this? Thousandsblessed am I the only one trying to make this a memorable experience? She rummages in her bag for a few moments before pulling out a physical map which she unrolls on the ground. Everyone gather round and take a good hard look.We all crowd around the map which is quite old and all marked up. It looks like someone made notations all across the map from notes about places to eat to interesting natural formations to where they saw and caught certain pokemon. While somewhat ratty its pretty obvious that its a very valuable piece of cartography.Let me show you my anticipated route. Rose begins. She pokes her finger towards Pallet Town. We start at home obviously. Next we move to Viridian City for some fun times hanging with Green. We restock on pokeballs and potions then make our way to Viridian Forest. I hear there are Pikachu in there and I dont know about you guys but an electric rodent sounds like a great addition to any team.That sounds reasonable. I wouldnt mind catching a Caterpie either. I say. After the forest we can spend some time in Pewter City if people really want to but it will probably take at least a week to get through the forest assuming we dont get lost. Rose continued ignoring me. I really dont want to have to deal with Mount Moon so I say we just take a shortcut through the Diglett Tunnel.Of course you would want to go through the Diglett Tunnel. Charles says. He rubs Phallus under the chin. I dont understand your insinuation. Rose huffs at Charles. Anyway my goal is to end up at Celadon City because I want to see the shopping mall. Anyone have any stops theyd like to make? But what about the Clefairy? Lori asks holding her hand up halfheartedly. What you really think there are Clefairy on Mount Moon? You realize theyre mostly just Zubats right? Rose rolls her eyes at Lori. Now wait a minute. There have been verifiable accounts of Clefairies at Mount Moon. I nod at Lori. And its not that big a detour. Besides do you really want to go through a tunnel that was carved out by Digletts? I mean who knows how structurally sound that is. Frankly Id love to see Pewter Citys museum. Edward says looking at Rose. And wed be missing out on the Pewter Gym if we skip by it. Charles agrees.I think we should just pass through Pewter City and Mount Moon. I say to which everyone but Rose nods along. Its not a huge detour and we can always just try to take an exterior route if the cave system is too full of Zubats for you.Rose takes a deep slow breath then sighs loudly. Fine. It looks like Im outvoted. But we still havent even hit Viridian City yet so maybe we should focus on that first. She rolls up her map and stows it in her bag. Anyway Im going to bed. Should we maybe take watch? I ask my tabletop gaming instincts coming through. What if a pokemon attacks in the middle of the night?No pokemon is going to attack us in the night. Stop being ridiculous. Rose says as she gets into her tent. Just sleep and forget about it. She then zips the tent closed.Its true. Edward says. Hes got a faraway look to his eyes as he talks. The likelihood of a pokemon attacking us is very low. Were still in a fairly civilized area. I wouldnt worry about it.The four of us sit up a little longer playing with our pokemon a little and making chit chat. Finally we all start to settle down and get into our sleeping bags. Im pretty sure that only Rose brought a tent so the rest of us just stay out under the stars. ,He_Who_Writes,d6391rw,2,t5_3fp3a
