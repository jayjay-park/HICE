5620544,1,t3_3reqfd,Sorry but hes not a girl just because he changed his name on Twitter and started taking hormones. He still has a penis XY chromosomes etc. For people saying this doesnt fit the new definition of gender youre wrong. That definition is not universally accepted so stop forcing it as fact. I have no problem with his choices but he is most definitely a man.,speedruncelebrities,cwts68h,-9,t5_39bol

6668121,0,t1_d091c14,I actually have a degree in psychology so I know a little about this. But youre right it does have all the red flags. What I think may have happened is when Cosmo was depressed his normal drugs werent enough to take his mind off his mental issues. So he figured hey ill buy some estrogen to try it out and indulge in his sissy fetish. But he wasnt prepared for how much the estrogen would mess with his mind. Now were seeing the results of that. He is too mindfucked by the estrogen to take a step back and realize what its doing to him. But hes also surrounded himself with enablers who are encouraging this behavior even though its clear hes being irresponsible with it. Theres a reason why normally transgender people are psychological screened for a year or more before theyre placed on HRT. Its because estrogen can completely fuck your mind up if you arent prepared for it. But I think Cosmo just decided one day on a whim to buy some estrogen online and now its turning him more and more mentally ill. ,speedruncelebrities,d091i0e,4,t5_39bol

7517697,0,t3_4i8rc0,haha I remember you! Im the one who said well its because they have an agenda against Narci.. I was not being seriously at all with that reply. Narcissa is just super paranoid about everything.I havent watched her stream since she put chat in sub only mode but I decided to give it a try last night. Chat was terrible... there were the people in there who were trying to have a discussion and then there were people who just cried cancer! cancer at fucking everything.Seriously Im so sad to see what happened to the person that got me into speedrunning and watching twitch streams. At some point during the stream I said that I think Mario Maker is kind of restricting and Narcissa immediately went I think Im being trolled right now but how is Mario Maker restricting? Shes antagonizing her entire viewer base except for some of the SJWs who form a shield around her if anyone tries to say something thats even remotely logical to her. And then she complains that she doesnt get her old viewer count anymore. But from what I can tell her average viewer count is  viewers I know a lot of streamers who dream of having that many viewers. But its not enough for narcissa... its never enough. She just comes off as a spoiled brat by now. She has so many people who try to support her and I think most people would love to watch her streams if they were actually good. But no she just uses them to complain and to cry and to brag and to earn those pity points.Im livid about this but Im also extremely worried about her. I dont wish depression on anyone but shes just letting shit happen to her. Shes not even trying to make things better. What the fuck kind of life style is she even living? She has no fucking bed sleeps on the ground. Her apartment the part you can see on stream at least is empty. It looks like nobody lives in there. Shes chugging this soylent bullshit instead of eating actual food that tastes like something. Any person would go batshit crazy if they had to endure this long enough. Now add to that the hormones she takes which fuck with your mind and your body in crazy amounts. And dont forget the drug abuse. Two days pot free. Whoopfuckingwoo.If you want to transition to being a girl go for it. Im all for it. If it makes you a happier person fine. But get your life in order first. Make sure you have REAL LIFE people who can support you when youre at your worst and who are happy for you when youre at your best. What Narcissa is doing is absolute madness. She does not seem happier than before her transition she seems worse.And of course when we talk about her like this none of us know the whole story. Nobody has their facts in check. No of course not all we can do is talk about what were seeing. Since when we ask her to elaborate our questions fall on deaf ears. I only wish Narcissa the best. I hope shell find a purpose in life instead of just drifting from day to day wondering what she should do. Maybe she should read some selfhelp books. But she cant carry on like this for much longer. And I understand that it is hard to find something productive to do. But sometimes in life you just have to get off your ass and do whatever it takes.I suppose its just much easier to sit in front of a computer screen and complain about life for a while...This turned into a longer rant than I expected but I had to get it off my chest. Cant talk about this in her chat. Youll get crucified.,speedruncelebrities,d2wq3wz,4,t5_39bol
