5668376,0,t1_cwzdmqy,you should know that new leaves come in rolled up and unfurl and that in low light the leaves close in together. in light they open up a little. so the curling leaves part and leaf movement isnt a worry its normal. second look does look like the leaves are winding themselves back up. ,houseplants,cwzpucd,0,t5_2skiq

Youll need to act quickly if you want to save it because they really dislike when their environment changes.Misting it and keeping in on a gravel tray are fine but you really need at least C and a humidifier plus a solid ten hours of bright light during the day.  Stephanotis is native to very warm climates with good humidity year round.  And they arent hearty in any respect outside of that.  ,houseplants,cyryb3b,1,t5_2skiq
6196596,0,t1_cytr5pi,Thanks for the response. Sun is lacking. Our entire apartment actually gets low sunbut we were told this plant didnt need much sun. I will check for bugs. I hope not!!The stick came with the plant. Maybe we got a dud? Cinnamon?!?!,houseplants,cytzjfp,1,t5_2skiq

8660783,0,t3_4x7v0p,Aside from the obvious Pothos I have a rabbits foot fern that has been growing slowly but steadily in my office cave. Its a really cool unique looking plant. I would suspect other ferns would perform similarly. ,houseplants,d6o7qt6,2,t5_2skiq
8913099,0,t3_52cnsq,It looks like there is nice new growth at soil level so a drastic pruning will probably end up making the plant look better in the long run.  Those two big floppy stalks are never going to stand up again on their own.  Cut them off and the plant will divert that energy into making new growth.  ,houseplants,d7j82s8,2,t5_2skiq

10921044,0,t3_5w0vu3,So I was given this chinese evergreen years ago by my mother and father in law. They had seperated their own plant and given me about half of it. Its been doing ok but its ridiculously  leggy so I had to stake it..Also the tallest stem has some leaves on it that seem to be struggling a bit. That being said its still growing new leaves.. any thoughts or suggestions on what Im doing wrong or what I should do?? Thanks!,houseplants,de6fgux,2,t5_2skiq

11314058,0,t1_dfe6p6n,I work in the greenhouse industry so most of my plants come from there. Seek out a locallyowned garden center. In my experience thats where you find interesting plants and knowledgeable staff.,houseplants,dfefier,2,t5_2skiq
11495847,0,t3_63zxrw,Whats that cool plant in the second photo with the variegation in the center of the leaves? How much light does it need? I have a shady corner that would look perfect in if it doesnt require much light.,houseplants,dfz1xq3,1,t5_2skiq
