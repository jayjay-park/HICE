208759,0,t1_cevaa4o,I dont think so. Asha will require considerable development efforts to continue to be relevant as a platform let alone investing that kind of work for a lowend device. Android is already there and skinningtheming is dramatically less work than updating an old platform. I dont have any interest in the Normandy as such however if its possible to unlock the bootloader we could be looking at an open unlocked device for  or less with decent hardware great built quality and the potential to run the latest version of Android via CyanogenMod.That should make everyone happyaccess to the highestend services available in a smartphone with some of the best build quality for  or less unlocked. Thats virtually unheard of with the next closest option being a  Moto G.,Nokia,cf27yyk,1,t5_2r1gy

1133912,0,t1_chwqen2,Wow thats amazingly idiotic. I dont understand why I cant just create a new album from within the phone. On every other device Ive owned I could just create a new album by hitting one button I didnt have to jump through any hoops or hook it p to my computer.Its whatever though. Im not even upset that I cant make albums because its not that big a deal. Its just the piss poor logic that some features demonstrate that kinda grinds my gears. Thanks for answering.Edit of course I got downvoted. Shouldve known better than to utter that filthy blasphemy about the technological marvel that is the Lumia . Hail to the Nokia gods who can do no wrong! Praise be to Microsofts miraculous operating system of many wonders!,Nokia,chx6awu,-1,t5_2r1gy

3615260,0,t1_cq4cxik,Yes youre right.My E rarely leaves my bedroom anymore but I do take it  out once in a while to tinker with its EDoF camera listen to podcasts and read email. The battery is too short term now Im in love with that form factor Nokia can have  bucks from me if I can get an updated version any OS will do.  I guess Ill be stuck with my Xperia Z till New Nokia returns in mobile glory. ,Nokia,cq4d6a2,2,t5_2r1gy

7792439,0,t1_d3r99fe,One of the main things is that my workplace deals with sensitive information so there are lots of security restrictions. Smartphones arent allowed in some areas because a rogue app coughfacebookcough might try and turn the mic on and start recording. With feature phones you generally dont have to worry about that sort of stuff.,Nokia,d3rxeuo,1,t5_2r1gy
9456891,0,t3_59td2m,I am afraid they will hold off until MWC  at which point the S rumour mill will start going off and the SD and other specs will start to look outdated.Really hope it releases in time for the christmas season seems like its a good spot inbetween big releases and rumours and still keeping the specs relevant.Really want to replace my G and the only alternatives Im tempted by are the LG V which is to big for my taste and the V neither of which seem to be coming to Europe.,Nokia,d9eq866,2,t5_2r1gy
