1274350,0,t1_cicy7qy,None before release. When the build is out there will be a dev vlog. Or you can play it then.,tdl,ciczcne,2,t5_2sr6x
1327745,0,t1_ciizkna,P I was kind of hoping you had replied with what gmt is because I have no idea either..,tdl,ciizljk,2,t5_2sr6x

1887728,0,t3_2g8bzr,I gotta say this game is going to be completely different by the end of the year in comparison to last year. Its already turning into the zombie game I always wanted A.K.A Slow zombies and no special zombies procedural generated worlds vehicles and proper barricading. I have a feeling by the time all these visual changes and optimization changes roll out the sales will boost.,tdl,ckgnvra,13,t5_2sr6x
2236810,0,t1_clo57zu,I getcha. Like I said not being rude or criticizing. Yall are an indie dev so predicting when an update will be out is challenging. Companies like eugen however that never have set release dates but are a professional company however...,tdl,clo5hnd,2,t5_2sr6x
2760802,0,t1_cnhuxa0,Im not sure which city youre referring to but the map is much larger than Salt Lake City some of the surrounding mountains in Salt Lake Valley were actually used in our heightmap for the ingame region.The map itself has multiple cities inside it that were developing.,tdl,cnhw56a,1,t5_2sr6x
2824818,0,t1_cnp3iyc,Yep you can see bits and pieces here and there in Build  that would allow you to catch a glimpse of our future plans and the scenes were working to achieve  with a little more time and detail put into them.I hope we can bring that detail soon. ,tdl,cnp6ciy,1,t5_2sr6x

3569046,0,t1_cpz190n,Oh so do I just apparently it annoys people.,tdl,cpz3jzy,0,t5_2sr6x
4033109,0,t3_36p8bs,Im disappointed that procedural generation is no longer in the game and yes that was one of the reasons I bought it.  That being said I dont think this ruins the game as some seem to feel.  This will still be a massive world to play in and I look forward to playing in it!  ,tdl,crg07a1,5,t5_2sr6x
4658185,0,t1_ctho4xy,In terms of combat you end up reaching a more philosophical problem Do you reward those who invest more than those who have just started playing? Assuming that the vision of the game in terms of online suits a multiplayer experience of  players I think that really means you and your friends. Sure large scale pvp could cause issues however I think the benefits would outweigh the odds in this case. ,tdl,cthpzup,1,t5_2sr6x
5659342,0,t3_3slyfp,Man I knew this was coming. The long wait for a good zombie survival game continues.,tdl,cwylgwh,7,t5_2sr6x
5764359,0,t3_3tqfrq,Sorry but I dont care what the are doing. Even they would do the best game in the history they would not get any dollar from me.,tdl,cxbmeh2,5,t5_2sr6x
