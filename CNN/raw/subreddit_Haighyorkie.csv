37945,0,t3_1udvsk,I woulnt play with  strikers on top if I was you play with one and with a cam behind him. Just like arsenal does with zil if you want to try and change that you should custom the formation and change the player positioningNOT the Base Position to atacking with R to the right than he makes more attacking moves. You could I wouldnt do that directly also do that with one of your cms or cdms so they get more involved in the play. With Fullbacks the same story if you got quick players on those possitions you do the same as with the cam with R to the right then when you get possession they automaticly make the runs. And if you want them to be more intensively involved you change the player work rate on that possition.,Haighyorkie,ceir1wk,1,t5_2zf4h
