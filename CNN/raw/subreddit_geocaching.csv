My guess would be no.I can tell you what I did when I went geocaching in central New York last summer without a data connection. I did have a GPS device but with over  caches I might look to find I had to save the info on each of them somehow. I saved the geocaching.com page for each cache as a PDF on my iPad. I was then able to view each caches coordinates description hints and logs offline. I also saved the geocaching.com map of all these caches as a PDF.I can also tell you what I like to do when I dont have a GPS device the one I used belongs to the local library. I like to look at the satellite imagery usually I plug an individual caches coordinates into Google Maps and zoom in as far as I can to get a good idea of the area. Obviously this doesnt work where there is tree cover. If you have the space find a way to do this for all the caches you downloaded the data for.I was about to suggest that you download a GPS locator app for your Android but I am unsure if that counts as data. Its not as accurate as a GPS device but its better than nothing. Id look into whether your provider considers that data or not.EDIT According to the Wikipedia article on GPS for cellphones AGPS you do need a data connection. Its your choice not to bring your GPS device but am having a hard time wondering why you dont want to. Im certainly not asking why some might consider that an invasion of privacy.

5895412,0,t1_cxscvlg,I have one of the newest Samsung cell phones and although they work well for when there are not many trees or buildings around you I would highly suggest always using a good GPS when you hide a cache.

It is amazing how much better handheld GPS units are when compared to newer cell phones when there is any type of cover ex trees over top of you.

Found the ammo can managed to get it open and most of the contents had melted together into a huge mass.  The log notebook survived fine just had to pry it out of that mess. So if you do place a cache in an area that gets burned itd be wise to check on it after a burn and have some notice onin the cache as well as the cache page to avoid putting anything inside that can melt.

10132283,0,t3_5krdtw,I have less than a dozen hides so policing them is pretty easy for me. I will always delete a second Found it! log from the same person. Sometimes its an obvious mistake  they clicked SUBMIT twice or their phone was doing something weird  because the two messages are identical but other times the two messages will have different text or one will have a picture and the other wont. In the case of duplicate messages I delete the later one and in the case of duplicate finds I delete the less interesting one.I dont particularly care about spoiler images in logs because I always include a picture of the cache with my description. I started doing this shortly after I found my first throwdown and I was kind of pissed that I didnt find the actual cache.The only issue Ive had is with a guy in my area who is now a wellknown armchair geocacher. Hes got several hundred claimed finds but nearly all of them are fake some laughably so. Hes claimed several dozen finds in a single day with caches spread out over hundreds of miles and sometimes in different countries around the world. Hes particularly fond of signing scraps of paper and taking a photo of it as proof that he found it. Anyway hes made fake logs on a couple of my finds and I deleted them immediately.

10381400,0,t1_dckrzys,Cache Owner stats dont really matter to me since they arent used for anything.

But if I get a bunch of caches that were amazing and Ive run out of favourite points then Ill take it back.I also do favourite point list maintenance and go through my list and reminisce. If I cant remember anything about the cache then Ill take it back. I use favourite points all the time when searching different routesplaces and appreciate how useful they are. If a cache is archived not really useful to anyone so unless the cache has a good personal memory unique hide or amazing location Ill relocate the favourite point to a different cache. Id have no problem if someone does the same thing to any of my archived hides.That said the nearly all of my  favourites are pretty much set in stone so removing favourite points doesnt happen often. ,geocaching,dcksnvy,2,t5_2qyvl
10465378,0,t3_5pq932,In my experience the community of old geocachers who take it way to seriously actively discourage new people from getting involved. I got really interested in geocaching did it with my girlfriend told lots of people about it and got some friends doing it. I had some fun ideas for projects to get new people involved in geocaching talked to some friends and family about it and they thought it was a really good idea. I joined some online communities to present the ideas and was shit on for being new was told I was trying to take advantage of everything they had worked for and clearly I had no interest in geocaching outside of trying to make money for myself.The response I received drove me away from being interested in geocaching. Im an entrepreneur who likes working on projects related to things Im excited about and was accused of basically trying to rape the geocaching community of its innocence. In reality the project was about getting more people involved in geocaching.So yeah perhaps people have ran out of caches in their area but that certainly wasnt my issue. It was the toxic community with a holier than thou attitude that pushed me away.,geocaching,dcucv53,2,t5_2qyvl

10799473,0,t1_ddtuypa,Sure if you have a data signal at a cache site and then youd have to switch to a gps app to navigate to it. Personally a lot of my caching was done in areas where one wouldnt be able to get a data signal. But I know this doesnt apply to many or most casual phone appers most of whom have no clue you can cache offline without a data signal. ,geocaching,ddtvzz6,2,t5_2qyvl

10987709,0,t1_decm3p9,Im pretty sure there were some Teenagers having sex in the back seat of a car in a mostly empty parking lot in State Park when I parked there for caching although I didnt walk up and look or anything. They were definitely in the back. My story though is I stumbled on a female nude sunbather on a somewhat remote beach when I had my then  yr. old son with me. She was on her stomach on the way to the cache but on the way back to the car she was on her back and fully nekkid. But she saw us coming and covered up with a towel. ,geocaching,dedf7et,2,t5_2qyvl
11058307,0,t1_del0gkv,I use cgeo too. I love offline storage and maps. My problem is if Im going off grid chances are I want to conserve battery life in case of an emergency. Portable power packs are only so good. If Im going on a multi day kayak or hiking trip for example the phone is powered off and stored to stay dry. Ill only get it out when we stop to check in. Even with no cell service cgeo is a battery hog. The battery life on the gps is better and I find the accuracy better some will argue. I just flat out prefer it for off grid uses. In town I use my Galaxy or iPhone  of the time.  ,geocaching,delfvru,1,t5_2qyvl

We also have an ottawa county so I was looking for a bridge over a soloman river in that county. Theres no such river there. Now I see its ottawa county KS which has a nearby city called Minneapolis!

11740626,0,t1_dgqsuw0,Ok great. Yea i see the options to purchase a plan now. What is the difference between cellular GPS and this actual GPS which is the cheaper option? I need to make this as low cost as possible,geocaching,dgqtvuk,1,t5_2qyvl
