3588595,0,t3_31gjof,Im not sure if this is the best sub for this or not. This painting was thrown in the trash near my apartment and I just couldnt bare it. Someone obviously spent a lot of time on it and so Im giving it the wall space it deserves. Im just curious about a backstory where it came from how old it is etc.. I know its an incredibly long shot but id love to find the artist to let them know that their work is being appreciated!,LostAndFound,cq1bszw,1,t5_2qxs7
