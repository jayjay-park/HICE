52091,0,t3_1uokak,its not bad but not something of interest to me. show me a modular design that is hot swappable and well talk.old dual slot processor servers use to have a dandy little design and is a huge reason why i miss slot processors. The slot processors in some dual slot boards could be hot swapped. ram as well. Basically they way they designed the motherboard was in such a way that the entire dual socket module could be removed from the mainboard. it in itself would slot onto the motherboard so not only was the socket processors hot swappable if you fried that part the entire cpu socket section could be swapped and also upgraded to support better cpus without sacraficing replacing the entire mobo...they was not cheap back thenThe ram worked in a similar fashion  slots split up into  groups of . they would sit on their own little socketed module that could be removed. the trick is you could swap out  sticks at a time by removing its module.sadly it was an extremely rare design and came out right as prices for that sort of thing really started to drop so it became obsolete very quick. very interesting design.if this could hot swap in a similar fashion i would be a little more excited but even then all the hardware would have to be proprietary to the case so at the end of the day you dont actually have too many options except what razer decides on but limited hardware option does not mean limited consumer market take apple for instance. so i think if razer redesigned this to look more home friendly ie appealing to the average user...not a gamer that likes to rice their stuff they could actually have an interesting easy to useupgrade desktop pc for the average consumer with a strict set of hardware availability ensuring very stable results but thats no easy task and i dont see this heading that direction so i very much doubt it will ever make it out of the concept stages and if it does its probably not going to sell well.,Cyberpunk,cekd00i,3,t5_2qi50

Im not sure how the exchange rate was in  when the movie was filmed  so take that into consideration. However  the total box office for its  release in America was  and in  it was  . That is a fucking HORRIFIC return. Thats like . Is your m over the  years the film has been available. Hollywood does not aim to make movies that will take  years to make a good return. Hollywood aims to make movies that are hits at the box office  and then will be hits on DVDBluRay. The movie did do much better at the Japanese box office  but Hollywoodin this case Warner Bros. doesnt really make movies for the Japanese  they make them for Americans  and it is our box office that they are targeting. I work in the entrainment industryIm a network and system adminconsultantMSP. I get to sit down and talk with many of the people who make high profile movies and TV showsthink famous directors  CEOs and producers. The last time I was asked by a producer what books I read and what ones I thought would make neat movies he told me We couldnt make any of those into feature films  because no one would really understand them  and they wouldnt make any money  which is why we make movies. The majority of people dont go to the movie theater to think  they go to be entertained and eat candy. Making a big movie with a ton of special effects costs a shit ton of time and moneyif you want to do it right and not take like  years to make.  Big production companies are a big business and will not drop millions and millions of dollars on something that they dont think will sell. There are a ton of nonmainstream films coming out  however they rarely have the cash to buy the rights to something like Akira or Neuromancer or whatever else. Only the big companies have the money to do that and the big companies wont really make movies like that unless they dumb them down and cut them up. ,Cyberpunk,cfcy7x2,2,t5_2qi50

1039748,0,t1_chmfale,gt Those are very broad speculations at this point.Some of the more reasonable ones at least. When the news came out there was a guy on the front page of roculus claiming that facebook was going to steal your retinal scans and use them to steal all your data...somehow. All your data that isnt in any way locked up behind retinal scans at all. Using a device thats completely incapable of taking a retinal scan. And people were buying into it in no small numbers.Honestly I think Redditors hate and fear change more than anything else. The itchangednowitsucksandIhateit attitude is even more prevalent here than facebook after an interface change.The Screwed crowdfunding argument is silly though. Its the same as arguing that Venture Capital ruined small business because now small businesses will only start aiming for venture capital. At no point did they make any promise of refusing funding or acquisition by a larger company and to say that the ONE crowdfunded startup with a promising product that was acquired by a large company is in any way significantly different to every other acquired startup is silly. Their obligation to you ended when they fulfilled your backer reward. Younot you you but you know what I mean didnt buy stocks you didnt buy equity you bought an early version of a product because you had faith in its success and guess what  being acquired for two billion by a company that promises you a near unlimited line of funding and have both promised to be and have shown themselves to be capable of being handsoff in these sorts of acquisitionsWhich are nontalent acquisition for example instagram whatsapp friendfeed is a better success than could have ever been hoped for.,Cyberpunk,chmh2f4,1,t5_2qi50

1085856,0,t1_chqyoln,Californian here. Ive never heard of anyone getting ticketed for being too low here. Unlike a lot of states we surprisingly dont have a safety inspection so people dont often get hassled about it.Mostly its the gofast parts that are strongly regulated. Anything from turbossuperchargers to air intakes have to undergo a stricter  set of tests re manufacturers have to pay the state tens of thousands of dollars in testing fees before they are allowed on California roads. Engine swaps are also regulated and must be approved by the California BAR before being street legal.Slightly political sidebar This is all under the guise of limiting emissions but I think its a cash grab with environmentalism being a happy sideeffect. The reason being if you install an illegal part and still pass your emissions test the part is still illegal and youre not allowed to run it on public roads. I ask if what comes out of the tailpipe is whats important who cares whats under the hood?

That said Im not really saying you shouldnt be allowed to change anything and if they chose a halfjapanese actress it wouldnt bother me ... however if they go so far as to recon the character to being half American.It just feels like theyre saying Hey Americans! We know youre so hopelessly and embarrassingly xenophobic that you cant care about a character unless shes white! We threw you a bone. Be embarrassed.

Then there was BTLs that having been ruining lives since st edition. BTLs are awesomeBetter Than Life. If you have a chip jack that allows you to have better skill sets you can experience BTL chips.  Then there were the junkies that used their data jacks at theaters to experience BTLs in a movie theater setting.  They could be a movie experience or just straight general feeling like heroin and people would spend the last few years of their life wasting away on ithad much in common with opium.  Withdrawal would cause nausea and inability to eatnot that you would eat while on it.  Caused instant addiction in a lot of people.Honestly outside the regular drugs.

1439440,0,t3_2amoxq,cyberpunk was and is primarily a work of futurist literary fiction. its a subgenre of science fiction. Then came movies and it became subgenre of movies that where either adaptations or inspired by the books and even video games can be cyberpunk.Then it came to describe the searly s industrial listening computer hacker scene in meatspace.Today cyberpunk is on the verge of being considered retrofuturistic and alternative history as many of the dates of some of the original stories have passed.As for a cyberpunk revival I was thinking more of a subscene of hackingwhite hat and black hat and computer programming without the cheesy loud primary color asthetics of the modern hacking scene. Instead of a fantasy world the premise being we are getting pretty close to a distopian cyberpunk world.Also according to William Gibsonwho also coined the term cyberspace cyberpunk is a term to describe punk rocks st century cultural analog. Being whatever fills the same cultural gap punk did in the early smost likely HCPunk as gibson was familar with the scene but that happens  years later.Guess what  is next year.

1634266,0,t1_cjkrdfv,You can have a nonbloated Ubuntu not saying it will be as lean as Arch though.Basically you start with Ubuntu Minimal and build up from there.Alternatively you could go the other direction  a straight install of Ubuntu Desktop then peel off what you dont want this wont leave you with something as small though.I was investigating Arch for a new system I am building actually my first choice was going to be Crunchbang. I actually liked Arch  it took a long while to install it and get a desktop on it but I managed it.For me though it was just tedious. It reminded me of when I installed my first real Linux my first Linux install was a copy of Monkey Linux on a  laptop with  meg of RAM running Caldera OpenDOS  that was a frankenstein of a box A copy of TurboLinux . on a  laptop with  meg of RAM. I had to learn how to compile the kernel just so I could enable several different functions on that laptop that werent in the default kernel namely PCMCIA support the sound card and the builtin modem.I didnt mind it much for the install but as I was dealing with it I realized that unless I could find a pacman package of whatever it was that I wanted to install I would have to create my own or wait for someone else to do it.I was first concerned about Steam but that was taken care of. However a game I had purchased on GOG and unfortunately have yet to install and play  because after I purchased it I found that I couldnt download it because my current OS  Ubuntu . LTS  didnt work with it properly  even though the demo worked fine! didnt have such a package  so I would have to make one myself.Same if all I could find was a .deb or .rpm of a particular piece of software I would have to make a pacman package to install it properly. That in itself wouldnt be much of an issue  but the process isnt easy and in order to successfully make a package you have to have been able to install the software manually already so you have some kind of knowledge and documentation to build the package. So the gist was  to make a successful package you needed the knowledge to install it manually  which if you were able to do that you wouldnt need the package in the first place. But then again  you do  so you can uninstall it later if needed without leaving cruft behind. So  to install a nonpacman package you need to make a pacman package by installing it first manually then removing everything building the package testing it fixing any bugs removing the package making sure it removed cleanly and properly fixing any bugs there more testing  then finally you have a good package which you can finally install on your system and maybe give away to the rest of the world but if it is a proprietary piece of software  like a binary only game which you paid for  you cant legally do this  so you have to make the package for you own personal use just so you can later cleanly uninstall the software later.That sounds like way too much work just to play a damn game too much fiddling etc  when all you want to do is get some work done or have a bit of fun otherwise.Now  if that is something you like to do that is you enjoy mucking about with your system just to poke and prod at it learn its insandouts etc  and you dont mind taking a ton of time building such packages andor whoknowswhatelsekinds of custom configuration that is needed  then it seems like it is a great system. I really really fell in love with it until I realized the amount of work it could potentially be for certain things I wanted to do with it.I just wanted a new system to get some work done and play some games. Ultimately I decided on going with Ubuntu . LTS starting the build from the minimal install and building everything up from there. Ill be able to get the desktop experience I want XFCE and OpenBox I think while enjoying all the other extras of Ubuntu most of which I like otherwise.,Cyberpunk,cjl5x6y,2,t5_2qi50

1767450,0,t1_ck1vsvc,Nearly everyone dies in the original Alien but it still makes me care about and be interested in the characters. Some of the early scenes in Prometheus almost exactly mirror the opening scenes of Alien where youre just getting to know the respective crews of the ships the only difference is that while the Nostromos full of characters that are fun to watch even when not much is happening the ship from Prometheus is full of boring assholes with sticks up their butts who I couldnt give a shit about. And then if you dont give a shit about the characters why should I give a shit about anything that happens to them in the course of the movie? Prometheus had some great visual sequences that were completely ruined by the fact that they were happening to people that didnt have any interesting or likeable qualities and didnt even feel like real people. Its not even like they were flawed in interesting ways they were just completely flat and stupid and half the time their actions made no sense.The first act of Alien is a masterclass in how to set up your cannon fodder characters just enough that you enjoy watching them and care if they get killed.

I got the idea from Thad Starner who used his wearables that way for years. The issue I ran into was input. I could access and read data pretty quickly but imputing data was a chore with the keyboards I have. Thad used a chorded keyboard called a Twiddler that allowed him to touch type one handed while doing other things but I dont have the budget for one right now. Im trying to see if I can make one using micro switches and a keyboard controller but its proving challenging. I switch back and forth between the Pi and the cell phone as a CPU depending on what Im up to.

2065345,0,t3_2icnqa,I would argue that cyberpunk is so tied to that s vision of the future that it either has to be from the s or be somehow retrofuturistic to even be cyberpunk. If its not you could call it postcyberpunk but not really cyberpunk.An example of postcyberpunk fiction you might be interested in is Halting State by Charles Stross written in  and set somewhere in the late s its the story of an investigation into an apparent bank heist in an MMORPG that leads into a much deeper conspiracy. Its set in an independent scotland full of Google glass style augmented reality two predictions for the future that are on the brink of being proved either right or wrong depending on how the next few years play out. Its told entirely in second person which might be offputting but I remember liking it when I read it a few years ago. Itll be really interesting to reread in  years time to see what it got right.

You addressing Case I let work do illegal deals here in my bar because it entertains me to watch you hustle.An angel passed is variation on an expression someone says when it gets quiet all the sudden.  Like saying the world got quiet for a second because an angel died somewhere.  And the Australian is some drunk whos talking about shit he doesnt know about which is why Case who does know about it gets pissed overhearing him talk bullshit trying to sound cool.If the slang and conversational tone is catching you up Id suggest looking past the slang and assuming that you just dont catch the references that are being made yet.  Focus on the descriptions and the blurry drug fueled haze that Case lives in.

2685193,0,t1_cn91odc,You know thats another weird thing ... I never thought Gibsons novels were difficult to read. I always described reading his novels as almost like reading poetry. I love the way he describes everything and the way it makes you really feel like youre there. It honestly wasnt until I started hanging around on this sub that I ever heard anyone mention that his style of writing left them confused and now it seems like someone is saying that every day. I dont doubt that people have trouble following his writing but I never felt that way. I always felt like the Matrix was a shadow of Neuromancer. Im sure the writers were aware of the book and probably took the idea of simstim from it but by then VR in all its forms was pretty wellworn territory. I liked it for what it was but I was a little annoyed that really it didnt bring anything new to the table. As for the technological realm Im pretty much the poster boy. Started coding at  got a degree in CS professional programmer ... Im actually just taking a break from coding a game about hacking while typing this. Ahh well takes all kinds I guess but I still dont see the Matrix and Neuromancer as being anything more than related by the same genre. ,Cyberpunk,cn92p9s,2,t5_2qi50

So is blade runner. Every over populated use of kowloon city as a cyberpunk location grasps it too.I dont find it new and though it doesnt have to be it woudl depend on the perception of the near future.

3770074,0,t1_cqltca5,In a way both. Let me try and explain. Any grind activities absolutely turn me off to a game. I understand the need for them and the mechanic they provide in FP but its not absolutely necessary. Theres a way to make the game fun while you progress where it doesnt actually feel like a grind unless you make it one and I look to PlanetSide series as an example. A lot of that has to do with  renewable fresh content  focus on multiplayerpvp versus solopve  and engaging content. I hate to bring it up but WoW had decent progression up to level sixty. Granted a lot of the quests were downright boring after youd done similar ones repeatedly but there was so much content that it was an okay path to take. It could have been better. However the grind afterward was atrocious. It was uncomfortable to play. I ended up feeling disgusting after I quit. The time commitment was too high for too little multiplayer interaction. City of Heroes was the same way. Modernish games though Tabula Rasa Warhammer Age of Conan and Neverwinter were all the same. Grind. Grind. Grind. Im enjoying Warframe right now but its definitely not an MMO. It reminds me of Vindictus. Besides grind theres a required amount of time that you must dedicate on each login. Some of us only have  hours to play and Ive found that in a lot of MMOs thats enough time for maybe one quest. Maybe. And if you do need to leave in the middle of a quest you not only lose out on the progression but youre going to be letting your teammates down. I dont like that. I want to feel comfortable knowing that when I need to go someone will fill my spot and I wont lose out on any progression and I look to the original PlanetSide mechanics for that.,Cyberpunk,cqm0l4n,1,t5_2qi50

3784569,0,t3_33p9bj,Just finished Ready Player One.  Easily the best I have read in the cyberpunk genre and almost the best I have read in any genre for that matter super fun book which would explain why Spielberg picked it up to adapt into film.  Before that read Snow Crash and before that read Neuromancer.  Thought Neuromancer was a super interesting storyconcept that was very poorly written.  I have seen people on here say that Gibsons style of writing helped to produce some kind of image that was in line with the world he was trying to create but I do not go for that.  If I am going to tell a story that I am hoping people will enjoy I am not going to make it exceptionally difficult for them to understand what is going on...if that is what he was doing.  That being said he did kick off cyberpunk and some of the things from both Neuromancer and Snow Crash were very predictive of things to come b they were around i.e.the matrixmetaverse video phones etc.Snow Crash was a really fun book.

4587213,0,t3_3dumry,As a kid I got the Neuromancer computer game randomly one Christmas.  It was interesting and very much in line with what was going on in the world around me.Then I got the Neuromancer book.  It went way over my head.  It wasnt a th grade book... but what stuck in my head was fascinating.I was a computer geek so I was attracted to the idea of coming out on top of the technological playground.  It was an attractive dystopia.  The jaded but disaffected hero appealed to me.  The lack of real connection with society as well.  None of my friends were into it.  It was my thing.We live in the cyberpunk era.  It just never ended up quite like the novels wrote.  Neural linkages and implants are taking longer but all the other computer stuff didnt.  Much answers to the powers of large multinational megacorps.  Even little things like the Bell Europa access codes left on grid intersections in cyberspace like graffiti in Neuromancer have some weird parallels.Its weird having bought into it in the s watching it basically die a horrible death from overexposure and now its back again.  And its like a parallel Jules Verne version of modernity.  Except were actually at the point where some of the other predictions are looking more probable again.I am glad that I became a Cyberpunk fanatic for the past few decades instead of an Ayn Rand fanatic tho.,Cyberpunk,ct8tejy,5,t5_2qi50

Thats the NSA mind you arguably one of the most technologically advanced security minded organizations in the world Im guessing on the first part but given their budget it seems likely.

4645695,0,t1_ctg11cn,It really can be if you are caught in the wrong area. Manchester the city in the vid traditionally is Labour left wing and Liberal centreleft. After the Conservative right wing and Liberal coalition the liberals lost all their support in region. Now the conservative government knows that no matter how much money they spend on the city they are never going to get votes there. People vote as much by class and region then they do on politics. Because they can never win seats in parliament there the do not spend any money. In fact they cut whatever services they can. There has been an explosion of homelessness in the region over the last few years hostels and halfway houses have been closed which ends up with people on the streets. What is bizarre is marijuana is easily available. UK now produces more then it uses. Britain has begun exporting to other parts of Europe. We also do not have the same war on drugs policy that the US does. We do not have the budget to have that kind of aggressive policing or to keep people inside of prison. But we also do not really do much to try and stop reoffending. But we have a incredibly low murder rate Police shootings are are once every few years murders by shootings are about  a year.

For the most part you arent likely to get much of a chance to wear them for longer as most events you would wear them to are only going to last that long anyways. A typical night at the club usually starts at  and last call is typically at . It depends on a whole lot of factors such as whether you walk or drive to the club whether you are the early arrival type or what have you.In those heels specifically if youre a five foot hundred pound Asian girl who is fit and used to walking in heels she could probably walk in them all day long.

4976456,0,t3_3izuk5,        For me Cyberpunk is something that was supposed to evolve though its not often seen that way.Imo its not cityscapes with tllights crts amp styles that mix up punk amp retrofuturistic stuff etc. Perhaps punk ideals sure but not the old styles attached to it. It was always about a certain outlook on the future amp its social order. Not a retro outlook on said future or present.What is futuristic changes with time as well as the peoples outlook on the future. ,Cyberpunk,culti9w,1,t5_2qi50

I think that there is nothing overtly cyberpunk about this image but it does a great deal to set a tone with regard to lowlife which I think a lot of folks myself included look for out of this sub.  I enjoy the atmosphere that a lot of the content on this sub seems to possess even if there is nothing intrinsically cyberpunk about some of it.

5118612,0,t3_3l3r2d,Glad to hear of someone reading it for the first time. I go back and read it every couple years to reenjoy read the other books in the trilogy as well if you like this one. To your points Im out in the woods camping right now so if I give any misinformation or cant fact check my apologies  The beauty of his writing is really tied to the time it was written. This imagery was so necessary because so much of this idea was foreign to so many. A social space online was so uncommon in the way he wrote it. BBS was a new and very niche thing and an avatar or online life really needed to be descriptive in order to be grasped the way he needed. I couldnt agree with your statement more.  where you are in the book as I cant check my copy right now seems to be in the planning stages. As I dont really want to spoil something you may not have read I wont get into too much detail. All his stories tend to bounce around a bit and neuromancer is particularly crazy just wait till later with the characters jumping in and out of being jacked in. It may seem hard to follow at parts especially your first time. Though the best thing to keep in mind is that they need people with all sets of skills to accomplish what Armitage wants to pull off. Your second time will probably make more sense.  I think my last point answers this pretty well Our present is actually mirroring these points pretty well. One of the reasons I love his writing. Commercializing space is already in its infancy and will only continue to become more popular. As technology advances and becomes easier for the average consumer to get ahold of the vanity will continue to come to the forefront see smartphones for example. The simplicity of our culture is really reflected well and makes his stories that much more believable.  Yes   While this idea of the construct of the Internet is not reality it has a strong ground in the reality we live in. With the advent of Facebook and other communities reddit for example we see the else connections between everything in our lives. We share and communicate on these interconnected platforms the same as those who are jacked in just through our phones and other devices. Who says we wont eventually get there? Ive always been interested in the eventuality and he continues to explore this more as you read forward. His other books in this series Mona Lisa Overdrive and Count Zero continue this so again I do recommend reading on. Also if youve ever seen the movie Johnny Mnemonic or read the short story they also touch on it. Please watch the movie its do campy but so good. I also have always wanted to get a Microsoft port tattooed behind my ear such as the people in Memory Lane from the series. Just a random love of mine. Glad to hear youre liking it keep it up.

5131061,0,t1_cv3uop8,gt  Can you point me to some of the actual studies that have proven these concepts? What kind of evidence do you want?

But if you want someone seeing some thing take place in real time with a camera.   That is mostly out of our power right now as a species.  gt I think most Computing Studies do cover logic gates and how a CPU is comprised. Even despite that information being nighuseless to  of general I.T. work. I know mine did at least.Yes because computing studies is a comprehensive topic.   Cognition is not.  My point was that we feel we know a lot about the brain because like my fictional character we can identify the video card we can change IRQ settings with surgery.

5468215,0,t1_cwahj9h,The street finds its own uses for thingsYea. The street does not ask for features to be included. The street does not write angry reviews. The street does not give it only a one star rating on yelp. The street just does. It will and forever has. I did noit mock that it could be used for this. Hell find a way to use it and its fine by me. What I mocked was OMg I wrote the publisher and asked them to release their sourcecode so others could build an API for extra functions that would be usefull in the rarest of cases. Heck.... That is like complaining that the camping site you are on has open fires burning and they are not child safe. The problems about sound quality and transfer speeds is not a new issueNope. Lets take this .The company is prepared to build a drone for people that are the typical snowbnoarders. They may be high on weed or more illegal things welltrained affluent upper middle class at least plus sports fanatics and the exact crowd that would meet in a   entry fee snow hut over starbucks and organic brownies to discuss how to solve world hunger by raising more awareness. Back when I was younger we called them weekenders  from their habit of just protesting on the weekends as a gimmick nowadays it seems the hipster thing to do.  They do not target the I have no money but want to do something cool crowd they target the I have more disposable income then I can handle crowd. This crowd does not give two shits about live transmissions it does not care about on the ground reporters all it cares is buying a new toy that is easy to use so they will not do a faceplant at   mph while sliding down a frozen wasteland they had no business being in in the first place. For them loosing a   phone is a mild annoyance. All they want to do is have an HD video of them seconds away from shaving with ice that they can then take it to their mac books open it with some video editing software and put a cool and hip track under it to upload it on the interwebs and post it on twitter. For that market it is easy to design a drone. make it easy to replace it should survive three crashes with solid objects at max speed and it should be able to film in HD and maybe even survive a bit of water in the air. Plus it needs to come in a wide variety of colors an should have some techno vibe. DING allready a sale what about that? Now if you start adding on to that list you violate a top design principle. A thing is not perfect if you cant add anything anymore but if you cant take anything away. also The more complex a system is the more faults and errors will appear. See before the drone was easy to design. Camera SD slot servos put them in a drone modell make it look good armband with battery write an app that tells the drone to follow the signal of the armband and to film the armbandm and you are good. With your proposed additions it becomes mway more complex. Not only are you asking for skype integration you are asking for features that would make the drone unusable for the average high hipster that just wants to blaze it  style step on his choice of thing to go very fast on  and have a bitchin looking video.  The drone for the hipster you could make for like   devellopment costs and most hipsters would not even complain if you price it at  . So sell  to your friends and family and you are good. Heck if you are lucky and handed in a few patents you could even make more when other companies wanted to infringe on your patents. You are set for the rest of your days. Your proposed drone would have to have its own nav computer which at least has to be dual core which fucks with the battery life and heat production. It has to carry more weight so you have to use higher powered rotors which make more sound. That fucks up the mike sounds of the drone so now they have to think about a way to compensate for the huge loud rotors which leads to them noit develloping their patches as promised. So the hipsters who the drone was created for have something completely unusable The few nerds who actually could use something as proposed wouzld rather sever their penis via rotweiler then to buy it prebuild and the few social activists that think this is the heaven will still complain because THEY are not going to use it it just would have been cool if someone could use it. In comic strip form Dilbert is allways very usefull. And then you add to this that drones need also to be used for Getting shot at Live news reports and you can allmost hear the project engineers gearing up to whip you punk ass with cat  cable untill you scream because the added armor plating would maximise the livespan but would require a drone double the size to even be remotely viable and to carry a car battery. Now mind you all the company wanted to do is make drones for stoners who like to go fast. They can do that. They never signed up to make drones for people who actually want to controll their shit. Yes there is a lot of news and media coverage on Everything but by letting others curate that news for you you are getting their opinion on what is news worthysimply put I get what is so attention grabbing that people make news about it. If enough people talk about it some idiot with a video camera will stand there making a documentary about using a cow taking a shit to play bingo. If you do not believe me The problem is I want to ignore certain things and pick my news sources based around that. That means if I can guarantee that a certain paper will not have the  billionth lets help all the syrian refugees callk to arms or the inevitable dey tuuk our jeeerbs article hell they have my readership. My ideal news source would be a kind of program like sick sad world that helps me dull the pain of day to day existance by cuttiong out everything even remotely attention grabbing and just showing me what shit around the world was fucked up today. You know all those We need to talk about syria OMG wage gap and Justin biebers dick is a feminist icon the prime minister of canada is a hottie look everybody its hillary clinton.  pieces just gone and as a filler they show life video feeds from emergency rooms around the country.  I know this is not entirely correct but it gets so sick when I get bombarded by live news cycles every  hours. I want to go to sleep wake up and for once not first thing in the morning har about what donalsd trump did racist today. The people want getting shot at news? Nope. The people want more then anything else certain news to not appear. That is why they traditionally gave the papers or the TV stations they did not agree with no money and in exchange were not bothered by their kind of news. If I coulkd personally kick all the people who today apprehended me with the thirty seventh reurgitation of OMGH a refugee just raped a white woman and make sure they could no longer pollute  the collective genepool by having children then hell I would do it. Interesting enouzgh you seem to have a close understanding of what the viewers want.  I admit my experience from the technical side was only because I hung around certified nerds so long as a corp nerd herder I can understand how they think. Do you have any xample of that in play? because as far as I can see it would be the same as armchair quarterbacking. OMG the news are biased. OMG if I were a reporter I would so do it btter. Then why are you not hired? many its bullshit... you could do it with a camera and a drone way better...OMG what if we had apple make an I drone that linked up with Siri and made it possible for us to use voice commands to tell our camera what to zoom on in? I would like to hold against this the following thing Omg what if you actually made a video channel with  K unique viewers and   episodes? Of just you reporting on news stories you find interesting? If you actually put this much work in and the people actually watched this I would personally donate the first  bucks towards outfitting you with a custom made drone according to your specs so you can become a drone reporter... Yes it is hard to find actual news. Just like it is hard to eat right loose weight get a wellpaying job have a significant other pay your bills on time stop smoking exercise regularely look good naked and have satisfying sex. If it would be easy it would be worthless.

The economy being managed by some state bureaucracy the village assembly a workers council etc would return the exact same result which is individuals having no individual control over their own life.

I live with very long term users of opioids and have used some pretty ridiculous stuff including u something around  times stronger than  times stronger than fentalyl which in turn is around  times stronger than heroin.Almost everything you think you know about heroin isnt true People these days usually order from the darknet markets and skip the middleman using TAILS and TOR or when your vendor sucks functioning on codiene phosphate and hydrocodone going round pharmacies to collect it. Its cheaper faster much much safer both legally and in terms of adulterants and opiates themselves including heroin if you remove adulterants are MUUUUCH safer for your body than alcohol is.This idea of buying brown sludge in silver packets to use with spoons and needles is an image that only exists where computers dont. Its largely white powders either insulated or taken anally.The analogy works because people with fufilling lives generally tend not to get addicted. Those who feel some void or something missing or who have miserable lives can get addicted to just about anything and heroin is one of the hardest.Addiction is a social problem. Its a life problem.See you can come clean. Thats the easy part. Lots of people do it between paydays regularly and get really good it. But then the boredom sets in and then the lack of satisfaction from life and the depression and the lack of fulfillment. The circuits in the brain tied to reward dont find life rewarding. Our survival instinct honed over . billion years is to go to what rewards us because we evolved to find survival behaviors satisfying.Flat out lots of people just dont or dont get enough of the right survival behaviors they need. Our brains havent caught up with  years of technological development yet.Addiction is a symptom of that maladaption.Go look up Bruce K. Alexanders Rat Park experiments. Addiction rates correlate almost directly with the exact same factors in humans as they do rats. Population density scarcity of resources risk vs reward for conflict the requirement for abstract thinking over intuitive reasoning to function availability of consistent trust safety and mates. Bruce even anticipated the existence of what we now know as hikikomori shutins who cant function because the world isnt worth it.I should know. I havent left the house for anything but groceries in months and I havent had any kind of social life in about five years now outside of the internet or my significant other whos the same way. Were lonely people hyperfocused on our interests and substance abuse who function largely because Im disabled because of psychological illnesses and he takes care of me sometimes as if Im a child because my perception of time and events is a mess and all spoken language is a second language to me because of my severe isolation.We take care of eachother.

I honestly believe that almost no one should have to endure torture like this and even less for the kinds of infractions outlined in the video too many stamps or toilet paper rolls as one example. Saddly as long as we thirst for torture as punishment this will continue. ,Cyberpunk,d2pj0cl,1,t5_2qi50

7497830,0,t1_d2ufq3w,gt Exactly. These things  mundane today  were fictional cyberpunk equipment detailed in a sourcebook.As a lazy afterthought. Yeah you COULD use a cell phone if you wanted and didnt have enough money for a cellular net link that let you share a virtual meeting space that was indistinguishable from reality. Thats like saying We have CARS! Just like they do in the Cyberpunk  sourcbook! You realize they had cell pones when Cyberpunk  came out right? Yeah google maps would be impressive because theres no way a dystopic corporation would give that information out for free. Not because they didnt have the technology. Hell they had people living in space full time just to build and curate the satellite network that was also a part of the network of space stations they LIVED ON. What we have is a minor step forward from what was out when Cyberpunk  came out. Not only do we NOT have anything even remotely as impressive as the technology they had in Cyberpunk  but were so far away from it that were still not going to have anything even remotely close to it by .  ,Cyberpunk,d2ugqc1,1,t5_2qi50

Its exactly where I expect it to be in the virtual world. And Im controlling that holding the handle of the sword in my hand  not a mouse and keyboard.

So Ive tried modifying a motorcycle jacket some headphones etc ... to integrate functional computers that would enhance the function of the original item.

8756869,0,t1_d6zv31u,can be sure. Ive used GIMP. Its a nightmare and it is in absolutely zero way a viable replacement for a ten year old copy of photoshop. Every time people say Just use gimp its just the same as photoshop I die a little inside. Ive used a few digital darkroom programs...Bibles actually pretty good and I still go use it for specific features from time to time. I keep a linux computer around because I like playing with it but it cant ever be my primary computer  But the reality is the vast majority of people have to be able to do shit with specific commonly used programs. If youre a graphic designer or artist that WORKS with other people at all ever you HAVE to use photoshop. Absolutely you CAN do damn near anything on any platform. Hell if you really want you can professionally game on a fucking MAC. But it limits the shit out of your options.And most people dont have and cant afford a machine where WINE is a real option and dual booting is  NEVER a viable option for someone who needs to access the work side of their lives at a drop of a hat.

The movie looked amazing but it got wrapped up with a few things that just hurt the film overall. Would have been significantly better without Die Antwoord in it and that would have fixed a lot of issues with the movie. They even wore band Tshirts with their own faces on it which was very th wall breaking. They also arent very good actors Ninja was better than Yolandi though and were inexplicably two out of the  main characters of the movie. Overall the movie was more style than substance but it still had a interesting dilemma it tried to present which was Are robots people if they can feel emotion.

8819546,0,t3_50wrvt,Are you asking about what I think about the artwork?  The writing?  The idea of the zine?  Very nonspecific question.  I will address all three!THE ARTWORKThe artwork is by far the strongest aspect of this Zine. Most of it is engaging on topic and wellconstructed.  Most of it seems reminiscent of things that one could find on DeviantArt which is not a knock as I think that many of those artists really understand the cyberpunk aesthetics. It makes me wonder thought.  What benefit do the artists gain by participating in a Zine like yours?  Especially when they already have many venues on which to gain a following?WRITINGThe writing is bad.  I understand that this is a prototype and so you maybe dont have anything that is polished.  Maybe you couldnt find a decent writer to produce the prose for this mockup that is fine.  But compared to the quality of the art the writing is clearly lacking.  In fact the story on the fiction section was I assume just slapped together to have something to fit the pictures?  I dont get it.  If you are trying to sell writing then it might be nice to have something that is wellwritten?  In the absence of that I think that just pulling something from the public domain would be good enough.  But as it stands I wouldnt pay to read the quality of writing in the story.And that is a problem because the writing on the blog and such is even worse.  My opinion since you asked is to use better writing to showcase what you potentially have to offer  especially for  a magazine based on writing. THE ZINEI am hesitant to comment on this because there are so few details.  Also I dont really wish to crush someone who is out there trying to create something because that is admirable.  At the same time I fail to see a viable business model.  As you note on your blog there is already a large amount of free content out there. Thus a paid alternative must offer something that is better than the free version.  For some people it is the implied privacy that comes with a closed gate  though it is difficult to imagine that you will find enough people for whom that is appealing and who also love reading cyberpunk.Thus we are left with the content rather than the delivery. This is important because if you have the worlds best delivery system for delivering shit no one will want it. The thing you are actually selling is the content of the magazine.   And this must be somehow better than what someone could get for free.  As noted above the artwork seems to be on par with what is freely viewable thus it is unclear that on aggregate you will be providing better quality artwork.  Even worse the writing is noticeably poorer than what I can find online for free. This is a dealkiller.  Why would I pay for writing that is worse than I can get for free?But for the sake of argument lets say you find authors who contribute and who can write as well as those that post for free online. Then what do you have to offer?  The only thing that would distinguish your online format from others is the juxtaposition of words and art.  Do you think that this juxtaposition adds value that is equivalent to that of your subscription fee?  It is hard to imagine that is the case. I hope the above wasnt too aggressive I was just trying to give you my thoughts as you asked for them.  I in general love the idea of people creating things.  I just worry that you are trying to create a paidfor service where there will be no demand.  Can you tell me what the valueadded aspects are which will make people want to pay?It had better be something.  To put things in perspective.  I currently pay . a month for access to the entire music catalog of google. If you are going to charge  a month as stated on your blog are you offering something that has more value than double the entire music catalog on google?  I cant see how that is possible. But it could also be that I am missing something.  I could just not be part of the target audience.  And I am willing to accept that .,Cyberpunk,d77zm2a,11,t5_2qi50

But Gibson is obviously much more skilled at the art than I. Also scouts are his AI nanites which is the word ive been using for now that are programmed to watch his surroundings. The whole idea is that he is outfitted for certain scenarios not just a hacker god. He uses technology with his will still trying to figure that one out but could easily just be a neural implant. Also with the pursuit it was simply that they were trying to lure him into a trap and he said fuck this I am tired. I would like to find a better way to word it.  The Idea is that he was supposed to be gifted. Not everyone can be a Technomancer but many try. The point was that they teach familiarity and it was his use of psychology more than anything that effected Gruff. I am sure in the world that is only a few hours old that if he wanted to relive those memories he could have but the sudden rush of realization gave the MC the upper hand.

If you want ARM support you dont want OpenBSD and nothing is going to change that short of writing that support yourself. That means what youre really looking for is a SBC with intel processor. There are options out there and you can google around to see what OpenBSD supports among them but its clearly not a focus for them. Is there something specific you need OpenBSD for as opposed to the many different flavors of linux that support ARM as well as it could possibly be supported?If you just want terminal access and youre stuck on OpenBSD theres always the option of simply booting it in terminal mode and then building a terminal with an arduino. You wouldnt have X but if you NEED openBSD chances are you dont really need X. I havent really done the research but you might even get HDMI out with existing OpenBSD ports for some of the more popular SBC. I dont think X is supported though. I could be wrong I havent really tried much OpenBSD on that kind of hardware because its generally a misfit to begin with. ,Cyberpunk,daj5z2e,1,t5_2qi50

Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering...        Damn kids.  Theyre all alike.gt But did you in your threepiece psychology and s technobrain ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what made him tick what forces shaped him what may have molded him?I am a hacker enter my world...gt Mine is a world that begins with school... Im smarter than most ofthe other kids this crap they teach us bores me...Damn underachiever.  Theyre all alike.gt Im in junior high or high school.  Ive listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  No Ms. Smith I didnt show my work.  I did it in my head...Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  Theyre all alike.gt I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second this is cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake its because I screwed it up.

10552279,0,t1_dd47ihi,Its a good read and a good into to the Cyberpunk genre. Other notable authors are Phillip K. Dick and William Gibson. Nothing against PKD but I recommend Gibsons Neuromancer to people who want to see how deep and wellwritten Cyberpunk can be. ,Cyberpunk,dd47wuj,26,t5_2qi50
10558424,0,t3_5qzcr8,My view may come off as either snobbish or critial of the cyberpunk subculture the latter is definitely true but I see both Dick and Gibson as just writers. They both were singular writers who just happened to coincide in their material and style with vague trends that people liked to see and then tried again and again to recreate oftentimes in a rather geeky fashion.In other words Gibsons and Dicks writing was broader and larger than any genre. I feel that there is a big difference between scene writers who pointedly work on building the collective genre with its ideology rules themes and traditions and big writers who just stand out almost becoming a separate genre in themselves. Scene works are often more cerebral make great emphasis on worldbuilding and rules and sometimes are even formulaic. In other words you can imagine cyberpunk subculture writers reveling in their sweet genre churning out novel after novel for people who just cant get enough of cyberpunk. Its the kind of literature you can suggest to people with the words its like X only more. By contrast Gibson only wrote three pure cyberpunk novels and moved on.In other words the difference between any two novels by Dick or two novels by Gibson most of the time is greater than the difference between pure scene cyberpunk and some other genre. You cant really serialize them.I guess its the difference between big literature and niche subculture stuff for example Gibson was not confined to any insular subculture and his inspirations actually included basically anything BUT science fiction. Thats not to say genres and subcultures are bad  for instance Alistair Reynolds is a proud heir to the legacy of classic space opera and says that much... but of course his novels are so good because theyre nothing like classic space opera.Also I must say theres nothing inherently wrong with serializing  firstly big writers may do it because they found a very prolific formula like Pratchett or Le Guin secondly sometimes its so fun reading ten books about the same universe like Battletech or Warhammer K. Likewise nothing wrong with genre  but different writers lean on it to different degrees of comfort. Biggest ones rip the genre apart reinvent it remix and turn it on its head  even in novels that look like a love letter to genre.,Cyberpunk,dd4x0h1,1,t5_2qi50

We need to work to survive. We can go out into the wilderness and live off the land which would let us survive at subsistence levels or we can go into civilization and work within an employment contract that gives us a much higher standard of living.The freedom to choose ensures that generally speaking people in a market economy are choosing one of the better options available to them rather than one of the poorer ones. It also ensures that when people DO interact with others it is because it is generally mutually beneficial. This basic dynamic leads to an emergent property of actions carried out in markets generally being a netvalue gain for the economy as a whole.gtSorry I must have missed that part of my own post. I also love it when people invoke Orwell in the same point as arguing for voluntary relationships in CapitalismI evoked Orwellian not Orwell. Youre missing the subtle difference  the nuance of my comment if you will  of the distinction.Im fully aware of Orwells foibles including his embrace of Marxist quackery.

11385637,0,t1_dfmj6v8,Thats not what Im saying at all hence the not catching on.Motoko Kusanagi was born a Japanese woman. You pretty much never see her because the Major in the manga is just a mind inside a plastic white robot without a Japanese appearance. There might be some flashbacks to Motoko as a Japanese woman in the various incarnations of the story.But thats irrelevant to the point. Major Kusanagi as seen as the main character in the various GiTS stories does not have a Japanese body. Nor is her cyborg body designed to look Japanese.As a result its ridiculous to whine about the fact that shes not played by a Japanese actress or that shes been white washed into being played by a white actress. If anything a white actress looks closest to what her cyborg body is supposed to look like.So kudos to you for figuring out that someone with the name Motoko Kusanagi was born Japanese.
