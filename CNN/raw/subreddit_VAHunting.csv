2596335,0,t3_2pd3i9,Im sort of in the same boat. New to hunting and dont know anyone in the area that hunts. I was going to go out on my own but wouldnt mind going with someone. Unfortunately Im in Arlington and Thompson is a bit of a hike. I was going to head down to Quantico and use a shotgun or bow as there is no rifle hunting on base. Good luck,VAHunting,cmxh7q8,1,t5_30kcn
