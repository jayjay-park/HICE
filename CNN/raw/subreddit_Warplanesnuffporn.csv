10215099,0,t1_dc1rzr9,gtLike you would have stood up to the government that gave your life meaning. The only difference between you and that Pilot is circumstanceI dont know that I would have been able to make a better choice had I been living under similar circumstances. That still wouldnt absolve me from the things I may have done or choices I made in this hypothetical. There were a lot of people who did make the right choice though.gt Also you seem to forget that the Soviet Union was as aggressive and equally responsible for the war.Are were discussing the USSR? No we arent. gtHindsight is  noYeah and in hindsight the Nazis were fucking stupid. gtIts unfair to view the German people from the perspective of the results of the war after the fact.No its not. The people around them at the time knew just how wrong they were. They saw the genocide the illegal wars the aggression and the lies. Why do you think they fought a war? Just for the fun of it?Why do you think so much time and effort has been spent since even before the war ended to catalogue the crimes of Nazi Germany and its various institutions? Because people even many Germans recognized how horrible it all was. gtOne could argue that the Americans were invaders in a foreign land and that our only excuse for fighting them was their association with the Imperial Japanese Government.Oh? I guess Germany declaring war on the US didnt happen? gt But FDR started fighting that war well before the American people voted or decided which side to take before Dec.   many Americans sympathized with the Germans.Many did but the support for the Germans was not nearly as widespread or organized as you seem to be implying. gtThe real ones to blame are the allies in WWI a war for which the victors are as much to blame but for which Germany was harshly punished.Lol Germany started WW ravaged French land massacred Belgians and imposed a treaty upon the Russian Empire far more draconian than anything that came out of Versailles. gtFitting it was I think that the French and British paid so dearly for their criminal behavior in WWI and how sad it is that after all of their treachery and deception they committed directly against the US the US still sided with them in later conflicts.Are you really saying that the US should have supported Nazi Germany? The state who brought all of Europe into war and would have murdered more than  million people if they had won. That is the state that you think the US should have supported?gtAfter WWII the German people were enslaved and or degraded by their hosts. No they were saved from their collective delusion and they successfully threw off the shackles of by far one of the most despicable ideologies to ever exist on this earth. gtThey were taught to be ashamed of who they were in the West parts They were taught to be ashamed of what they had supported as they shouldve been. Fuck the Nazis. They did more to ruin the Germany than anyone else did before or after. After all Hitler found Berlin a city of brick and left it a city of rubble. That is the legacy of fascism death and ruin. And they brought it upon themselves. gtand we see the results today a dying country.Lol at this point I am not even surprised you would say this.,Warplanesnuffporn,dc1xtm8,3,t5_396rh
