8271829,0,t1_d5b9lu3,Thanks for the response. Thats how id understood it but cant figure out how the U.S gets involved fast enough with only moving over  ground pieces at a time through the transport. Anyways what you outlined was exactly what we did created a complex in Sinkiang and India. Unfortunately the Russian line in Caucus fell within  rounds by the Germans so i couldnt get the U.S rolling in time.,axisandallies,d5bjdb3,2,t5_2ti97
