1364018,0,t3_29p9b8,I live in the Metropolitan which used to be called  Oaks just near the hospital. The renovated apartments are nice but the rent is a bit steep for a two bedroom  iir I have an unrenovated apartment that Im currently renting for ... and management is a bit condescending... and dont get one on the top floor facing west since the AC hasnt been updated in many years and will cost extra smonth in the summer... BUT it is close to downtown and the pet policy is extremely liberal which is nice if you want to own a smalltomedium sized dog.You WILL hear your neighbors though and your chances of smelling cigarette smoke andor pot in the hallways is quite high and parking can suck when occupancy is high but other than that its been a mostly comfortable home for almost  years.If I could afford better wed be out of here in a heartbeat but the convenience of being close to downtown and the pet policy are what have kept us from leaving for this long. Just be aware of the things I mention in general when looking in the WC area is all.FWIW I have a friend who lives in the Heather Glen apartments out on Rt  and her management has a its almost Section  so we might as well treat it like that attitude but she pays less than month for a  bedroom so there you go.The flipside is another friend who rents a small one bedroom right in downtown for like month its the most spacious onebedroom I have seen in the area and its two blocks from Market in a nice quiet residential area. No pets though. So there are places to be had for lt maybe even two bedroom but probably not in any of the big apartment complexes.,westchesterpa,cin9p6u,1,t5_2si67

4605187,0,t1_ctb1k19,I understand that they are going to mandate parking below any new buildings built in town. But things could change.Whered you hear about offices and a courtyard? I dont know if they can attract more businesses to the borough but it would help growth and the restaurants immensely. Id rather they build an office on a side street though and grow the place. Replacing that spot with offices leaves if a dead zone at night! Unless they ground floor retail it.I am interested in more public areas. As West Chester grows it needs to keep some small green spaces. Id love to get a green space for the farmers market and in the process remove that empty lot blight.,westchesterpa,ctb2igu,1,t5_2si67

Bernie is all about the small business owners and workers and campaign buttons that are hand made locally by a member of the community helps send a strong message. Theres an opportunity for both of you here.,westchesterpa,cvqyaly,3,t5_2si67

6348417,0,t3_42ak08,Stroud Preserve is obviously the best but for something closer within walking distance Hoopes Park is pretty good. There are a lot of trees though so you have to be careful with that.,westchesterpa,czb8svt,1,t5_2si67
8670521,0,t1_d6ortba,Im not organized for this time but for future reference Ive found this on the SEPTA page Also note that the above machines will accept no more than  coins. Anyone parking for more than  weekdays will have to use dollar coins to stay under the limit. This coin limit does not pertain to either Elwyn or Exton Stations. This seems to imply that it is possible to park for more than one day and certainly up to . ,westchesterpa,d6pfp9m,1,t5_2si67
