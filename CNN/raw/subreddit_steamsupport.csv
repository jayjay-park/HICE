If the first one doesnt work try the next. try to open steam with different compatibility mode options delete ClientRegistry.blob and restart Steam backup your games and delete everything you can use revo uninstaller then reinstall steam again,steamsupport,cv85i3g,2,t5_2sleg
5546060,0,t1_cwkiyu3,Hey manThanks for the help for whatever reason now its working. I think there must have been some issue with Steam Servers for the game? A friend of mine from the same Region had the same issue then his started working when I tried it after him it worked then.This is now resolved ,steamsupport,cwkjg32,2,t5_2sleg
5989382,0,t1_cy4jfsg,Thanks!  Doing some more digging and hair pulling and it seems a bunch of people were reporting issues with the most recent beta client update which did in fact add a bunch of features to the controller.Since my controller is running the latest firmware I wonder if the nonbeta Steam client will have issues?  Well only one way to find out!  Its  unusable right now so it cant be worse than that!,steamsupport,cy4qm9u,1,t5_2sleg
