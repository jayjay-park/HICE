2830831,0,t3_2shq50,This was actually brought up in a CODA meeting that I attended. With other addictions there is usually a hard line between stopping the addiction. For instance if I am trying to stop heroine and I didnt do heroine for that day. I can give myself some praise. But codependency is so messy and intertwined with how we react and think on a minute by minute basis. I am not really equip to give advice but my encouragement to you is that recognizing this behavior is a good step forward.  ,Codependency,cnpuzrm,1,t5_2sblj
2967645,0,t3_2u3iuq,Hey not sure how it is manifesting for you...  I find myself falling back to my healthy routines...  Either with diet reading my notes and material from therapy exercise etc.  Just refocusing and dropping all the stuff that is not helping me recover or that is not important. Of course it all depends on where you are what is going on and your own unique set of circumstances.  Do you have a therapist?  Just wondering but if you do have you thought about temporarily increasing the frequency of your visits until this vortex passes?  ,Codependency,co5fq16,1,t5_2sblj

7492581,0,t1_d2thumy,This was fantastic thank you. Ive also been through this routine too many times to not realize something is wrong now in therapy working on it. I know its a long road thank you for the inspiration.,Codependency,d2tv6lt,2,t5_2sblj
7595810,0,t1_d35li23,OK  ... Does saying that work?  I feel like once a boundary notrespecter always a boundary notrespecter but that could be my all or nothing thinking. I have tried it before You arent respecting when I say no but then thats me telling another person what they are doing wrong... and no one wants to hear what they are doing wrong let alone to change.,Codependency,d35lstq,1,t5_2sblj
8215105,0,t3_4rvafh,Whats your general anxiety level like? Both of the problems you identify being too needyclingy being too judgemental both sound like they could stem from that. Honestly with the extremely long list of stuff you write describing yourself and things you are doing to heal and grow it sounds like you might be the type actually avoiding your core traumas through doing healthy things to help you with them as counterintuitive as that might sound.I like you have always been a hard worker. I apply myself with intense energy to my goals one of which right now is to recover from codependency. So I also threw myself into a LOT of activities and therapy like you did. But you also need to have breathing room and time to FEEL YOUR EMOTIONS and process them. This stuff cant become another addiction to distract you from yourself.How long have you been seeing these multiple psychotherapists? If youve been in a rut for a long stretch maybe they are not helping as much as you think and need to be fired. Codependents can cling to therapists doctors hell even barbers who arent any good because they are afraid to move on or deal with change.Have you read The Power of Now? Part of the problem with women may be the goal  a healthy LTR. What if your goal were to have a nice relaxing evening of conversation with an attractive kind woman? Then what if the next goal were to have a second and third date? What if your goal were to be to form platonic friendships with several women over the course of the year without expectations?Even if your first few dates go perfectly as you say I think they can sense your ultimate goal. That puts too much pressure on them and is unattractive. Live day to day live in the moment let things be what they are at the time. Also perfection doesnt exist  so there is no use striving for it only for the best things can be at this moment.Let go of the LTR as a goal for now. Trust the universe will make it happen for you when you are ready for it. You need to imagine a fulfilling life for yourself that stems from you internally.,Codependency,d54fycs,10,t5_2sblj

10035665,0,t1_dbfno30,gt Neat... obviously I dont have  MALE friends for now obvious reasons.Its hard to make friends in our isolated world where the successful are moving around all the time ... but dont you have facebook? Old buddies from high school? College? Church? Get out the old rolodex if you are living in the same city as your youth and get to work.,Codependency,dbfo9gs,1,t5_2sblj
10211085,0,t3_5m6dyq,Dream interpretation is definitely not scientific but I have to point to Carl Jung in this case. He basically believed that dreams are a message from our subconscious. The images we see are the language of dreams. Our subconscious has a language built up of known people places things etc. Like a code. So if you take a Jungian approach to dream interpretation then your not necessarily dreaming about specific people but the people you see in your dreams represent something. For example I have a good friend who is very motivated and organized. If she was in my dream then I would interpret her presence as my current feelings towards being motivated andor organized. The dream wouldnt be about the friend but what she represents in my own life.,Codependency,dc1hfpg,1,t5_2sblj

11780979,0,t3_67zumm,gt I cant prove if there is or isnt a God but if there is I dont feel comfortable putting my fate in hisher hands.Forgive me as I am also new to the realization that Im CoDependent.  Reading the quoted sentence made me think that that is your CoDependency trying to retain a bit of control.  The symbolism of surrendering and putting your faith in a higher power God or a better you if you would prefer is to represent that you are freeing yourself from your need to control.  ,Codependency,dgveu1n,1,t5_2sblj
