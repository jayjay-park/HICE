167059,0,t1_cexbi4u,I could actually explain the reasons why its done this way to you if you like. It has nothing to do with maximizing profit its actually about minimizing the potential for damaging losses in an business environment where pirating is ubiquitous. We can have that discussion but it sounds like youve already decided what you think so I wont go on unless youd actually like to hear the other side of things with an open mind.FWIW the Grateful Dead have been a commercial capitalist enterprise since approximately . Jerry Garcia lived in a mansion and drove brand new high end Beemers. But thats not really germane since as I say the limited runs arent actually about drilling for cash.uvivabarca is certainly correct that the entire live catalog with perhaps a few exceptions will be available for download purchase in the future.

799248,0,t3_23ajqh,I got a phone call from my boss right after i woke up informing me of the news.  It didnt seem real but I got in my car to head to my parents house to watch their cable news.  I turned on Pacifica radio and immediately Hes Gone starts playing on the radio and the tears came gushing. I basically cried for the entire  minute drive.  I watched CNN reports of Jerrys death for several hours and eventually the tears eased.That night the local heads met up at a bar completely unplanned and dranksmoked for hours while playing every GD song the jukebox contained. THere were tears hugs and i love yous all night.For several days many of us were catatonic. Many went to the memorial in Golden Gate Park I didnt had to work STUPID DECISION.The very next weekend i think purely by coincidence because they had been booked for months a tribute band  called Jerrys Kids played the same local bar. They played  cathartic emotionally charged sets and really provided healing for many of us. Within a month or two of Jerrys passing I went to see the David Grisham Quintet at my colleges student union. They played a wonderful  hour instrumental set and David spoke nary a word.  When they came out for an encore David finally addressed the crowd about Jerry and dedicated the final song to him. I dont know the name of the song but it was about the great guitar player in the sky. David sang. The entire band joined him in soaring  part harmonies on the choruses. It was fucking AMAZING. Maybe the most powerful moment Ive ever experienced musically and I toured professionally for many years. When the song was over the lights came and there wasnt a dry eye in the room. Some were sobbing uncontrollably. Fuck Im tearing up right now as I type.Its took many years before I was able to listen regularly to the dead as I had before Jerry left.  I never have been able to get myself to attend The Dead Further Rat Dog Phil amp Friends etc. because I feel like I would be let down because of the enormous gaping hole on stage. Jerry leaving was like a favorite family member passing. Lennon Cobain Mercury nobody...had the same effect. Never will.Sorry for the ramble. Im going to go self medicate now and get on with the day.

Each song can be incredibly meaningful and goofy hippie bullshit at the same time. The band has incredible artistic talent that they rarely take too seriously. Mike Gordon plays his bass with a screwdriver on occasion.Go listen to their new album Fuego. Its fantastic! I also demonstrates the duality i was talking about really well. Wombat is plain goofy. The Line is incredibly meaningful and Wingsuit is passionate stupid clever goofy meaningful nonsense.

I really didnt even start giving the band the attention from me that they deserve until about a year ago.But after learning about all the history listening to all the music I can at least empathize with the guy. Who knows I still may never get to see Bobby perform but if its something that helps him out in his personal life I owe it to him to be OK with it but in fact Im more than OK with it. Im happy he is taking some time off because its better in the long run.Meanwhile Ill still see Phil Lesh and now Bill Kreutzmann so how could I be upset?

4467637,0,t3_3castz,I feel like just on the wording alone by the default the answer is yes.  So really quickly name another American band that toured for  years?  I cant really think of one...maybe the Eagles come close but I kind of doubt theyve been together as long as the Dead were.  And again just by saying American right off the bat the Beatles are gone the Stones are gone Zeppelin Floyd etc are all gone.  But that aside their range covered more genres than most other bands American or not that would be considered to be among the best ever.  From the blues to spirituals to rock...they played Americas music.  And questions of their repertoire or musicianship aside think about how many people have seen Dead shows how many lives they touched or how many experiences people never would have had but for the Grateful Dead.  Theres something distinctly American about going out on the road hitting a few concerts meeting some people along the way.  You  didnt have to be a huge head to do that or to have fond memories of a road trip.  So in absolute terms of musical ability  sure there will be a lot of disagreement.  But in terms the very broad idea of what it means to be American and giving people a reason to get out and travel the country and see things they otherwise wouldnt have had a reason to and to connect us with our musical roots yeah Id say the best.  ,gratefuldead,csttl16,9,t5_2qpnj

4490725,0,t3_3cl7m3,I think part of what made Trey meld so fantastically was that he had  years of experience playing in a band that works for the most part towards the same goal as the dead. Cooperative improv towards a feverish unplanned accidental peak with tension release and a very careful ear to what everyone is doing. While Phish is more Treylead and the Dead are more Dixielandbased everyone sort of soloing at once Trey still had the skillset. I mean look at him on stage in the MLB rebroadcast... constant hand signals constant eye contact paying close attention listening for when he needs to step back and forward and on top of all that the band seemed to trust Trey well enough to let him take the reins and lead them towards new territory and Trey trusted the band enough to step back and let BruceBobJeffPhilBilMickey lead them in a new direction.John Meyer is a fantastic guitarist one of the best around right now. I wont deny that for a second. While a lot of the music he releases is shit he can play with some serious blues chops. My question though is can he play with a band rather than himself? I watched and listened closely to the Phil and John shows and while John was great he seemed to lack the critical ear and was sort of awkwardly stepping through the songs. Great solos but lacked the ear to listen sometimes.I dunno. I think he can do it but he doesnt have the extensive jamimprove experience. I feel like he could rise to the occasion... maybe. Ill hold judgment though because six months ago I was pretty sure Trey would be pretty good not transcendent.,gratefuldead,cswptfj,1,t5_2qpnj

4515510,0,t3_3cv50c,Sophomore year of college . There was an older guy Jay in my dorm who was into great music that the mainstream was still ignoring.. He would stop by and play us Dinosaur Jr records or Mudhoney.. He was also a huge Deadhead. I was into all sorts of music and in high school got exposed to jazz and the concept of improvisation. I loved it but I LOVED rock and wished there was a rock band that could improvise like the jazz musicians I had heard who knew?. My only exposure to the GD at that point was singles on the radio. Anyway I had discovered the Allman Bros Fillmore East album and was floored.. My roommate and I were playing it a lot and Jay stopped by and said wed probably really like the Dead since we were so into the Fillmore record. My roommate knew another guy and he got a hold of the Barton Hall show and by that summer I was hooked. Finally saw them at the Boston Garden in fall and never looked back.,gratefuldead,csztpqw,2,t5_2qpnj

It allowed him to play a sufficient amount of dates at a few very solid venues and allowed him to do so in locations where he could sleep in his own bed afterwards.  Im just saying its weird to totally stamp out a whole festival just because one artist isnt there and he likely will never be there again.  What would the alternative be flying out to SF to see him at the crossroads?  I mean theres nothing wrong with not going to Vibes I wont be there but if someones reason for not going is strictly based on whether or not Phil is there well thats a little ridiculous.  ,gratefuldead,ct5tu9c,3,t5_2qpnj

Hes just sitting back there tapping those symbols reliably on point the underlying beat the others play on top of.  separately I was a huge fan of drums and the beam where Mickey shook the stadium and he and Billy knocked things around.  I guess my point is that a case can be made that Phil and Bobby lost a step vocals too but Billy was just as good if not better than ever.  Billy was the unsung hero in my book.Though I really liked Phils voice in whats become of the baby liked that song a lot too.  Same ting with days between and Bobby.,gratefuldead,cul2j7r,3,t5_2qpnj

Bob and Phil didnt relinquish control enough with Furthur and maybe JK was unwilling to take the reigns imho.

7633377,0,t3_4juog1,I dont have anything to offer you for advice about the next best fest. But I would like to share with you something completely different based on you mentioning hiphop. I highly recommend taking some time to listen to This podcast of Raves and Electronic music The podcast is a bunch of comedians talking with an expert in this case Sunshine who will let you know about Raves and House music roots and how it progressed from Disco the streets of Chicago and to the masses via England. It is funny it is moving.From a historical perspective it is very interesting. But as a deadhead the take away is definitely that letting yourself go in music you like and sharing that with others for a good time makes you a good person and a truly actualized human being.In many ways the experiments of the s like the acid tests were the raves that evolved into the festivals of today. I am not advocating you go to an EDM show I am just saying that wherever you do end up jamming and having a good time be open thoughtful friendly and enjoy yourself.My favourite music experiences after all these years? . Furthur in Mexico  the pinnacle.  days of shows at night all the food you can eat at  restaurants with free drinks all day and night. The nicest people I have ever met. Classes in Tie Dye poker tournaments and a solo impromptu performance by Bobby. Grateful Dead music blasting all other hours. Expeditions in caves the ocean and pyramids by day. Climb the tallest pyramid in Mexico and this happens! By the way the Dragonflies showed up for this song and then dissipated when it was over.... Any of the shows with the Grateful Dead where we could camp or walk back to our hotels or in the old days home. So many good times so many crazy times..... A strange ravetribaltechno fun time with Hitting Birth back when they played Electric Washing machines and Electric shopping carts. When they were on it could get so weird..... Those times when there were acid tests or scenes or cosmos climbs or what ever you wanted to call them. ,gratefuldead,d39vg70,5,t5_2qpnj

Some of the tracks never should have seen the light of day black Peter ujb truckin while some are very good Cumberland helpslip king solomons marbles.

I understand how modern file sharing works. File sharing has done nothing to change the etiquette of the community. Shows are promptly removed from the community if they are not fit to be traded. I have personally seen that happen over the past year. In fact the link I posted earlier talks about this specifically in the context of file sharing. This is a band that is willing to give you thousands of hours of recordings for free. The least you can do is pay to get the few recordings they decide to release. Aud recordings of all the shows you want are available at bt.etree.org. Edit I started moving my server to a new instance with a  Gb connection last night ,gratefuldead,d5a0nq5,8,t5_2qpnj

8467698,0,t3_4vnur7,Bob likes  note chords and he almost always plays them inverted without the root on the bottom. Here are some good examples.        e      B      G      D      A      E      So these chords in order are F Emaj G and C. The F is the chord bob plays at the opening of Terrapin. The Emaj is the chord the chord Bob plays in Eyes. The G is Bobs opening chord in Cumberland Blues. The C is just a good example of a Bob chord. The  chord shapes are neither major or minor so they can be used for either. These shapes leave a lot of space to slide around to other. Or you might notice that going from F to C just requires putting one finger down Bob will do that a lot.    Hopefully this gives a little bit of insight if you want to know anything else just ask!,gratefuldead,d6001it,5,t5_2qpnj

If you like them because theyre fast there is Megadeath and Slayer if you like them because theyre heavy there is Motrhead and Exodus if you want to get retro you can get into Zeppelin and Sabbath etc.On the other hand if you get into the Dead what other psychedeliccountryjazzfolkelectric bluesAmericanahard rockjug bands are there? On top of that they are so clearly head and shoulders above every other band that tried to come along and play Dead music that you end up listening to all Dead all the time.So a combination of radical uniqueness and no real competition leaves you in his words with no place to go but the parking lot.,gratefuldead,d7391w2,3,t5_2qpnj

9349411,0,t1_d90kt3s,Phish is a jam band like the Dead and thats about where it ends with regard to music and sound.  The culture of the Dead was really strong in the late s and early s with commercial success and wide acceptance in a new generation of Heads.  The band was a long time stronghold from the s and thought to be elder statesman for touring and keeping the Heads on the road.   The reigns were due to change hands as the jam bands coming out of the grunge scene were born of the Dead.  The next generation of Heads could identify with similar aged upcoming bands that could jam and so the talk began of the next band to inherit the Heads and keep the love going.  This drive a huge wedge in the scene where the Deadicated rejected anything trying to be the Dead.  I was big into Blues Traveler and was in their camp for a better band than Phish DMB or Spin Doctors etc. but Phish succeeded in landing the Earth Muffin crowd and fostering a loving following that got on the road with them.  This comparison of similarities ticked off the faithful and the great divide began.  Or something like that.  ,gratefuldead,d913td0,2,t5_2qpnj

With or without the chemical edge.  It starts with an invocation and slides so very gently into another time and space.  I think its some of Hunters best work as a lyricist and the band totally dug into making a creative soundscape to go with it.,gratefuldead,denxb88,5,t5_2qpnj

The fact that out of care for this topic and to counter the inaccuracies in your perspective Ive tried to approach you with respect.

11254688,0,t1_df6lo7r,I mean Stapleton did copy Etta James on Tennessee Whiskey or I should say he copied the studio guys at Muscle Shoals. Which I wouldnt have a problem with if he admitted it nothing wrong with borrowing imo but last I read he claimed the song came about organically.I agree with your larger point about there being great country out there today just not exactly on the radio. A better example might be Sturgill Simpson although after the Grammys Im not sure hes under the radar anymore. Finally.,gratefuldead,df7pa1k,1,t5_2qpnj

11464137,0,t3_63mwol,Theres exactly zero information about the name Beauneu out there. But Ive got a couple of theories. First the name can be split into beau and neu which mean pretty and new almost its really neuf in French. So it could be a symbol for a youth who just doesnt get that Peters about to die.Or it could be a reference to Anne Bonny the famous woman pirate  from Johnsons A General History of Pyrates which I just happen to be reading right now.Both work but I like the second better. ,gratefuldead,dfvgbgd,3,t5_2qpnj
