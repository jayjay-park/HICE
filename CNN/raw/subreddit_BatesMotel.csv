I dont care what happens to the town criminals besides the Bates family. Bradley totally came back just for that death which is okay but it felt too forced. I didnt care for Dylan and the rapist of a father.  It was actually kind of boring this season. At least have Norman kill some random hitchhiker or some shit in the middle of the season so we can see him more in action instead of the last  minutes of the finale where we have to wait another year to see what happens. ,BatesMotel,cr67dk2,4,t5_2w7nh

3986195,0,t3_3629yl,Its interesting watching this show as a therapist. Norma and normans overall dysfunctions and mental illnesses are very logical and well portrayed for the most part. Everyone else are all very very static and passive in their interaction with the psychological abnormalities of Norma and Norman. Even the dysfunction of Norma and Norman are kept intimately between them. No one else gets to interact with it or show their stance on it beyond something is wrong with Norman. It makes the interaction between Norman and Bradley every other character including Emma when she was into Norman in SS very superfluous until the moment when Norman gives them the Norman treatment. Without the inner monolog from the characters Norman have killed and will eventually kill these deaths are difficult to have a strong emotional  oh my moment to it.,BatesMotel,crantyi,12,t5_2w7nh

The time isnt incredibly relevant but in the film and its sequels they do say that NormanNormas style clothes home furniture was very late s despite the film taking place in the mid th century.

7571352,0,t1_d32pxql,Ive probably seen Psycho a good ten times and Mrs. Bates and her lover dont think she had actually married him yet were initially thought to be dead due to a murdersuicide at the hands of Mrs. Bates. It isnt  until after Norman is arrested for attempting to murder Lila Crane that he confesses to his mothers death as Mother. The show runners said that Normas death wouldnt be exactly like the film but I still assumed she would die along with Romero  or at least around the same time.Anyway it would be easy to make her death look accidental. But the caution tape was torn all the vents were closed except the one to Normas bedroom. They could easily get Normans fresh finger prints on all of the vents. Also Romero Dylan Dr. Edwards and Emma can all attest to Normans bizarre and violent behavior. It wont be impossible for Norman to get away with this but it isnt like theres no evidence linking him to the crime. ,BatesMotel,d32tqm0,3,t5_2w7nh

10877327,0,t1_de0fj5t,Im guessing that theyll be changing a lot. If you think about it if they followed Psycho lore then the POV characters for a lot of the season will have to be Sam and Lilly. Rather then dedicated so much screen time to new characters they could simply have someone like Dylan and Emma be the two who puts Norman away at the end.,BatesMotel,de1x38f,1,t5_2w7nh

11319543,0,t1_dff1qdd,Ah I see. I should really watch Psycho. I saw the first half but fell asleep it was like am.

11367885,0,t3_61wmf0,I dont think she loves Norman. She loves the fact he is an extensions of herself the attention and control she gets from him. He exists only to serve her and her needs. You see this love being tested when Norman strays doing normal things like socialising whenever Norman does ANYTHING she doesnt approve of or tests her control over him you see her mask slipping and she cant handle it. She emotionally guilts him and has massive outbursts of anger to scare him back into being the person she wants and doing whatever she wants. ,BatesMotel,dfkj0fc,1,t5_2w7nh
11390738,0,t1_dfmmkat,I wouldnt say the monster was always there. I think it was more due to Normas smothering enmeshment emotional abuse and medical neglect contributed to cultivating the monster. ,BatesMotel,dfn4exi,4,t5_2w7nh
