506382,0,t1_cfxlucv,Bipedal movement has a lot of advantages. Its much more energy efficient than any other all terrain movement and it sits the head or in this case the cockpit at a higher and more advantageous position. Small machines will without a doubt use bipedal movement.Large machines at least ones made for combat will almost certainly not. The problem isnt that they wouldnt work its that they wouldnt work as well. We can shoot missiles from thousands of miles away with perfect accuracy. Between ships and aircraft we can get those missiles anywhere in the world. Mecha wouldnt be competitive in modern combat but the idea isnt outlandish.,ImaginaryTechnology,cfxtu44,2,t5_2tf7t

6310395,0,t1_cz6uzwd,The example is kind of backwards. As far as general issue weapons go theres not much difference in accuracy between WWII rifles and modern ones and as far as power goes sera rifles are far more powerful than modern assault rifles despite the widespread adoption of body armor today. Better doesnt necessarily mean more powerful it often means more closely adapted to the conditions at hand. Massive overkill isnt worth losing ammo capacity. Now if there is a need for more powerful weapons to get around armor sure future soldiers should be carrying more powerful weapons. But if your targets arent firstworld military powerarmor shock troops if youre expecting to fight rebel militias etc. an M will work just fine. If you can carry a lot more of the smaller rounds it would in fact work better than a more powerful but bulkier weapon system.,ImaginaryTechnology,cz6x6dy,1,t5_2tf7t

8125229,0,t1_d4tb8jg,Yeah... Im pretty familiar with that.  It can be a temporary good making you feel good when you otherwise would feel sad.  But what Ive learned is that trying to find real friendshipsrelationships online almost never works out you will always lose contact and get hurt.   Someone once told me that all friendships are temporary so maybe thats just the reality and has nothing to do with whether or not its online but with anonymity and the ease of permanently exiting that friendship they often dont last nearly as long and the chances of actually meeting that person is next to nothing.  The value a virtual friend puts on you is often significantly less than if they knew you in real life and because of that you are expendable and therefor are just as likely if not more likely to get emotionally hurt as a result.Thats how I see it anyways.  Thats why its unhealthy.  They are not and most likely never will be real friendships...edit To those lucky few who have found their husbandwife through their online activities such as Everquest WoW or other platform  more power to you.
