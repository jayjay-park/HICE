5576949,0,t1_cwocr3h,The trees were dead when cut and have been sitting for two years so its good and seasoned. But its mostly western larch and pine. Both can be pitchy which will create a lot of creosote. ,woodstoving,cwodf8e,1,t5_329i6
6431799,0,t1_czkdccv,Mine has practically no draw.  Single wall to the ceiling insulated from the ceiling through the roof.If I open the door the smoke splits between the room and the stove pipe.  We keep a cookie sheet handy and put it over the opening until we start putting wood in and get the opening closed up that way.  This is with the baffle open and it being a straight shot out the roof its not a problem with the stove.Once the stove is going its not an issue.  It has quite a bit of thermal mass.  Im always somewhat amazed at how well the stove runs.  Wet wood dry wood soft wood oak...  Doesnt matter once the stove warms up it burns.   The only issue with the King in the catalytic and even that was much simpler than I thought it would be.The last house I had a Harmon with a  insulated stovepipe above about  of single wall stove in the basement in a two story cape cod type  Once that pipe warmed up it would draw like a vacuum cleaner.  Didnt have to worry about smoke spilling into the room.  The Harmon wouldnt run for  hours though but heating up a cement basement is close to impossible.Fuel air heat.  Dont know what to tell you.,woodstoving,czkl4a9,3,t5_329i6
7509649,0,t1_d2vn6us,Yes I did! And I busted my ass getting it too! My plan is to have a four to five year supply on hand at all times so should I get sick or hurt I will have plenty of wood to get me through a few winters.Heres a pic of my wood stack...,woodstoving,d2vt5dy,2,t5_329i6

10022669,0,t1_db3hd7n,Sorry for late reply. Fires arent difficult to get going this thing can really take off. Its deceptively smaller than I thought inside but is rated to heat  sq feet.,woodstoving,dbdzck2,1,t5_329i6
10125028,0,t3_5kvqzi,I think that device would be good for really perfect small logs. But I think it would fail at splitting anything else.,woodstoving,dbrapw1,3,t5_329i6
