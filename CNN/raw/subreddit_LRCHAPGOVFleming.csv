2090969,0,t1_cl592c4,I agree with Megan. I do believe that the USA along with the CDC are doing all that they can to stop the spread of it. The thing is the people of America think that we have the abilities to hear about the virus hitting America and then the next day to have a vaccine for it but thats not the case at all. It takes time to make a vaccine for a disease thats deadly for most. The CDC has never had anything like Ebola to cure. ,LRCHAPGOVFleming,cl5lwg6,1,t5_335ju

3378046,0,t3_2xuh8b,Based on the article and what you stated Hillary clearly made a mistake as the Act defines. So yes she was most definitely in violation of the act and depending on the subject matter of her email it could have had negative implications for the U.S. but it probably wont.,LRCHAPGOVFleming,cpdbmgg,1,t5_335ju
5819830,0,t3_3tvyl7,Yes because as soon as we begin not welcoming people due to a specific circumstance we completely abandon the foundation our country has set in terms of morals which is to welcome all people and to treat everyone fairly and equally.  Terrorism is always going to be a threat to the US and to western countries in general so yes we should be weary but we shouldnt let that get in the way of upholding what we have always believed to be true and that is that all people should be treated fairly by our country and welcomed by our country regardless of their religious or geographical background.,LRCHAPGOVFleming,cxii6bi,1,t5_335ju
5896057,0,t1_cxhhvch,If we do end up allowing them to come to the US will they be allowed to eventually become citizens? Or will they be somehow urged to return to their home country after the crisis is over as is the case with most refugees statistically?,LRCHAPGOVFleming,cxsi9p2,1,t5_335ju

10583879,0,t1_dd4fwmb,Are you implying that all Iranians have a strong radical Islamic tie? Because that my friend is stereotyping an entire group of people. Iranian Americans exist. So do Syrian Americans. This ban is quite literally keeping families apart. ,LRCHAPGOVFleming,dd7n94d,1,t5_335ju
