The product is great but they really need to invest more in customer support if they hope to grow the user base.,Sense,d95kl26,1,t5_2qp6q

Knowing when garage doors are opened lights on computers running etc all with one device is super attractive.  If this all breaks as soon as my internet drops for a few minutes its not quite as attractive.  I wonder if the company has thought about some method of caching the locally identified devices to make the system more immune to loss of internet or even bandwidth usage.,Sense,df4xbq1,1,t5_2qp6q
