9626071,0,t3_5cotno,When I wrote the following wall of text I went to get some food and after posting it I noticed that someone beat me do it. I decided to paste it here so the other thread can be deleted.Hi I have no idea what Im doing here so this should be good .When I was six at most I was fortunate enough to see Beksinskis paintings in real life. Even though the gallery was for adults my dad sneaked me in. It made such a strong impression on me that two decades later I still remember the brush strokes on some of the paintings. It was an incredible surreal experience. Not long ago I actually had a chance to see his paintings again ones I havent seen anywhere on the web before.I could be wrong but I dont think he ever made any statements regarding that but my theory or interpretation is that all of these paintings depict the same postapocalyptic world or dimension. But it is so vast and the depicted objects and creatures are so distant from one another that they will never know that anyone else besides them exists. They will be forever stranded all alone. Its almost a void so empty that even bacteria and air are scarce so all the grand and strange structures have been and will be in constant state of deterioration and decomposition possibly forever. And this has been the case for so long that it appears as if time has stopped. But it hasnt. Ancient doesnt come close to describing it. Some of the paintings do depict objects we know a ruined modern city or a German World War II helmet so I do think its a postapocalyptic world.The main themes are definitely time death decay solitude and downfall of civilisation. I made an interesting observation last time I visited his gallery. Namely MANY of his works feature human hands either in the foreground or background. Some of his creatures are so twisted that its impossible to discern if they were like that to begin with or if they were once normal human but experimented on or something of the sort. And its the hands that make the audience question Oh my god is this a human?! Is this our world?! There was a story about stranded sailors who in their desperate starvation ate each other but even they would remove hands because these were just too human to be eaten. It goes to show how humanising and symbolic hands are. A rule of thumb at recognising his paintings is that if there is absolutely anything optimistic even a tiny ray of sunlight then the painting is definitely not his.Some nice examplesBeksinski also did some photography and sculpture though I dont know about those. Apparently he was also learning digital painting before he was stabbed to death about ten years ago. Ironic isnt it? Its real shame. Ive been told that he was quite popular in Japan but I cant confirm whether thats true. Ages ago I read somewhere that despite what his paintings might suggest he was a cheerful person. Well Ive heard some of his video diaries and he sounded anything but cheerful. Today I have a headache. Today the sky is grey as a floor rag.Today I have another headache.I have some other artists that I would like to recommend here but none are even remotely similar. That said a movie about Beksinski premiered about two months ago its called The Last Family. I havent watched it yet but it could be something worth checking out. I also suggest having a look at his much less popular prints they give a lot of insight into how the surreal ideas brewed in his head. If he was indeed popular in Japan then perhaps there is some anime to a degree inspired by his art?I dont think I could recommend the art more. So what do you think guys? Maybe some of you know him. I think these days hes beginning to get the recognition he deserves.,reccompendium,d9zm0xo,2,t5_3hj4f

10354212,0,t3_5o7bql,Maybe through crossposting?I am fairly new to Reddit and am not sure what exactly xposts should be but I try to promote rOugi with it on other Monogatari subreddits so if we posted every recommendation as a xpost in other subs with changes to conform to that subs etiquette  For instance every Metal band to rMetal Youtubers to rYoutubeRecommended suggest larger sub if you know books to rBooks or rBookRecommendations etc.Also if theres some way to searchoptimize this so it comes up when someone searches book recommendation or whatever we should definitely do all the possible tags. So far we come up in the second page when just searching for recommendation not that great.,reccompendium,dchpl42,2,t5_3hj4f
