That should give you some output or errors that will help troubleshoot the issue.Edit There is a stickied thread about common steam issues on the forum.,ManjaroLinux,cmxb1vr,2,t5_2xk2p

7741002,0,t3_4lc312,Ive personally moved the other way from Manjaro to Arch. The one major thing is probably the frequency of updates. Manjaro delays the updates for a week or two. This can bring in some stability but if theres a problem with the batch of updates it can take some while to be fixed. Whereas in regular old Arch youll get the fix as soon as possible.It can be easier to follow one major forum thread regarding the updates instead of checking the forums before updating every time which on Arch is quite often. Though theres a script to automate this I believe. So if you are willing to wait and see how the update goes for other people every few weeks youll most of the time know if theres any problems with it. At least regards to other peoples systems which might or might not reflect your setup.So I guess Id say it could be more stable but I havent personally noticed a big difference between the two. There have been some issues both in Arch and Manjaro when Ive updated but in both cases they were quickly resolved with a look at the forums. I cant say I noticed a major difference between the two in regards to these updates which is odd since youd kinda think Manjaro could be more stable having that  week testing period. In regards to the number of updates Ive done multiple times per day on Arch and every few weeks on Manjaro Ive encountered fewer problems with Arch per update than on Manjaro. But thats really not a good measure of it.TLDR You really have to see for yourself. I dont think theres a major difference either way.,ManjaroLinux,d3m3glf,5,t5_2xk2p

10799213,0,t1_ddt6xsc,I think your case for using Manjaro is perfect and I think its fantastic that you have the option to use Manjaro.   To be honest with you the main reason I became interested in Manjaro was for the OpenRC option originally.   What I take issue with is the nature of the article written.  I dont have issues with Manjaro.   The guy in the article writes about wanting to learn more about computers and chose to do so by installing Linux.   Learning how to install Arch will help someone learn a fair bit about computers in general.   Later he goes on to say how Arch is too much of a hassle and prefers how Manjaro installs itself among other reasons.   So the guy in the article is judging Arch and recommending Manjaro to others based on the fact that he didnt persevere through learning how to maintain an Arch system.   Arch isnt difficult it just takes time to learn it.  If you dont take time to learn it it will become difficult.    Thats my main issue.I love Linux and have been using it for  years.   I appreciate that  people have the freedom to use it and do as they please with it.  I do get upset when I see people with a limited understanding try to convince others that their way is the best way.    I probably shouldnt have said anything and kept my opinion to myself.   But I do get upset when I see people making excuses for not learningunderstanding more about Linux or their own computers for that matter.,ManjaroLinux,ddtv14w,1,t5_2xk2p
10993927,0,t3_5up1q6,If you are looking to game dont go with USB. They drop packets sometimes. I tested at least  different wifi adapters which worked on Linux  of which are ghz compatible  which are a lot less common all of them have the same problems. Eventually I gave up and got a wireless extender with a cable slot and just went with wired. ,ManjaroLinux,dee4l39,1,t5_2xk2p
