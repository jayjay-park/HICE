5444509,0,t1_cw7kp38,I do somewhat agree to the guarantee of getting the tickets the whole idea of the presale But  I dont really want  copies of the album or  downloads of the same two songs that will be on said album and  posters etc I just want two general admission tickets due to the way the presale has been done you have no other option than to pay double the price? It just seems crazy I dont have a problem supporting the band but I would rather buy a tshirt at the gig and pay the same as everyone else to get in than be forced down this route.,mutemath,cw7l75e,2,t5_2snwe
