Im actually looking at getting some experience with Salesforce a family member works with them and is helping me get trained up so this makes me more inclined to work towards that. ,cswomen,crccrj7,1,t5_2yrxu
6846756,0,t3_49j3r0,Second what Ramin says  codeacademy is great and rlearnprogramming has a lot of other resources available. Java is fairly easy to learn but learning a few different languages will broaden your skill set. C isnt bad either and plus its a different type of language than Java. If you want to improve your computer skills in general Linux may be useful to learn.,cswomen,d0sdx6t,1,t5_2yrxu
