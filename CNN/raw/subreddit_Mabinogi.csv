62750,0,t1_celiw4n,Mostly this is a matter of opinion and minmaxing. With a crossbow you can run while using normal ranged attack but are forced to stand still while using magnum shot. With a bow you walk with both and have a generally better range. Crossbows also have slightly lower damage stats. Im not sure what the attack speeds of the crossbows are but I know the HLB has a slow attack speed and this affects how fast you can successfully load more skillsshots.,Mabinogi,celko45,3,t5_2s4k2

4083278,0,t1_crlko4t,. I dont think there is a specific quest for that for older characters. Just have a friend take you on a tour of the Mana Tunnels it shouldnt take too long.. I will defer to someone else for this question.. You should take a look at max damage enchants on the wiki to see what you really want. I tend to favor midrank enchants as they wont give you too much trouble and dont usually have any repair cost increases. For example most of my equipment is going to have Nostalgic Camo once I get some more nostalgics anyway as those are just all around good for what I do.. Unfortunately its not so useful anymore. Its fantastic against magic and alchemy damage but it will destroy your mana against anything else. It probably wouldnt be worth it to you right now unless you happened to have a crazy good mana shield reforge somehow.. Thats a problem with Mabinogis engine unfortunately. There is a lot of things it does weird or wrong and if Im not mistaken it was even an experimental engine back when the game was first created. The only thing any of us can do is pray that they have a renovation dedicated to updating the outdated engine.,Mabinogi,crlpwk1,1,t5_2s4k2

Fusion Bolt the skill is very much not a priority to rank up. Its super important to use for damage but the skill only gives an extra percent damage per rank on only fused magic. Its a much better idea to focus on the bolt skills and masteries to increase damage.  Also as far as ranking priorities go you more or less want to start from the bottom up. Rank all the masteries and miscellaneous things like Inspiration and Snap Cast when you can. Work on the bolts as your first main priority probably one at a time but its really up to how how you want to handle it. Once all the bolts and relevant masteries are done is the time you want to actually rank up fusion bolt. From there go on to the intermediate magics as you see fit and then finally the advanced magics.  It doesnt hurt to have one or two ranks in everything just to play with it but that is how I see the priority list for magic.,Mabinogi,cuiovp7,1,t5_2s4k2

5308227,0,t3_3npkx1,Check the mabinogi wiki out. See if there are any outfits that you might like and where they come from. Its a long process since there are tons of cloths and a lot that are worth millions but its one way to go. If you want a faster solution run around different towns and check the npc shops. Then run around and check housing and player shops in belvast and dunbarton. Still slow though.One other option is to go to mabination use their housing search tool to find outfits in different servers. If you have an idea of what you want such as a dress then type in dress in the search. This way gives you an idea as to what is available in your server for a ballpark price. Though keep in mind housing prices are usually much more expensive than the small shops and kiosks in towns. So do your item hunting before buyingAs for spending nx on outfits either buy reforges or save the money for outfits. You can also sell nx if you are brave enough! Just stay away from gacha unless youre ok with a whole bunch of junk invading what little inventory space you have. Edit the reason I recommend using mabinations housing search tool is because you can click on the item you want to see and are then directed to the mabinogi wiki page about that item.

And before you say something about not everyone being at endgame archery is just trash until you bring it to endgame.Archery is just going to be stuck where it is until nexon does something with it which is probably never.

If you got lucky and got three lines skip and go to step . . Use Credne reforge until you get three lines.. Use Fine reforge until you rank up to rank .. Continue using Fine reforge until you get the reforge you want and level you are happy with.While you can get lucky and get the reforge you want without spending ton of reforges it is generally cheaper to buy preforged gear due to this RNG nature.,Mabinogi,d9iay84,4,t5_2s4k2

10743509,0,t1_ddnu89m,First thank you for an actual response. Royal knights is something I will be working towards for sure. May I ask though why you say the armorgloves are extremely useful? Thanks on the mana needles I figured they were trash but wanted to check. I dont overly mind staying combat or even want an ease of use playstyle. Ive just read its a core foundation that basically everything needs so started there. Whats this R Wig? The Fh cooldown wig makes sense. Any idea roughly on the price these typically go for? Bard is something I for sure will be working on today and tomorrow to get out of the way. It seems super helpful. I dont see bard taking to long to level up so from there what would you suggest? I dont really know whats considered hardend game etc but i know the Peca dung seems really rough but till ghosts i do really well with the people Ive done it with.  A puppeteer and an alchy. Thing is compared to them I feel overly useless and spent the majority of the last half sitting in a corner. Understandably due to my low level but just really want to make sure Im building to solid. ,Mabinogi,ddo411k,1,t5_2s4k2
