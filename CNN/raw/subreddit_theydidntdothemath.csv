7029503,0,t1_d1860ak,I tutored a few family members a few years back and Ive seen crap like this.Their new big thing for math is forcing a process that anyone can learn reasonably well then mandating that process be used when learning.I was lucky that I got through school at only the leading end of this where smart teachers let their students opt out of the stupid parts.  The new math classes are generally more challenging for people who already know how to do the math.  Nothing is worse than this is easy the answer is  and getting halfcredit for showing normal work instead of spending a full page on this kind of junk.,theydidntdothemath,d1d5ces,3,t5_31hic
