4699300,0,t1_ctmvrav,I honestly didnt even look at your PSU. It might be already not sure. There really isnt a standard on how the cables are only the connectors.EDIT Just looked the cables are wrapped but not individually sleeved. I see what you mean. Ive seen this done and its all on preference. Doesnt look bad but in my opinion it looks better with each wire individually sleeved.,helpmebuildapc,ctmvwmy,1,t5_39d0q
4700265,0,t1_ctmzq88,Oh wait. I remember now! He should be fine anyway right? Unless the connectors are in series and not parallel but thats unlikely...,helpmebuildapc,ctn09x3,1,t5_39d0q
4700276,0,t1_ctn08io,you need to be plugging it in to your GPU not your MOBO. ,helpmebuildapc,ctn0bpk,2,t5_39d0q
4700382,0,t1_ctn08qa,Thanks for the quick reply! POSTs  Power On SelfTests? Thats what my googlefu showed. So once I have it all hooked up I should check to make sure it powers on before installing into case. Do you do so by hooking it up to a monitor and making sure you get the bios screen? Should I install my OS at this point? I have the . installer on a USB drive. If I dont mess with the bios or anything else at this point is it safe to just power it off and unplug from PSU before installing the mobo?,helpmebuildapc,ctn0syp,2,t5_39d0q
4703931,0,t1_ctngmcy,You can try posting there again and also posting to rbuildapcforme.  Also if anyone from this sub wants to help or has any suggestion they will help aswell just saying that the right subs for choosing parts and suggestions are mainly rbuildapc and rbuildapcforme. Good luck!,helpmebuildapc,ctnguul,1,t5_39d0q
4723881,0,t3_3fmcup,So switching from RAID to ACHI while the current installation is using RAID is a bad idea. Instant bluescreen. This does sound like a possible MOBO issue either with the board itself or the BIOS. Attempt updating the BIOS at your own risk. If still nothing then I think an RMA is in order. ,helpmebuildapc,ctpzgvg,1,t5_39d0q

4948011,0,t1_cui5po9,I agree completely. If OP is still uncomfortable maybe invite a friend who has done it or something like that. Offer some beer or what not. Its a great  experience building a pc and I think youd regret having someone else do it. ,helpmebuildapc,cui8jnz,2,t5_39d0q

6129590,0,t1_cym7m9b,I tried with just the new SSD in sata and it got to the Loading OS screen then it said remove disks or other media press any key to restart.So its definitely trying to boot from this drive but something fails so it tries to boot from usb.Im assuming something is wrong with my clone. That or i should have formatted the drive with MBR instead of GPT.Heres a screenshot of the drives in minitool partition wizard. One thing that stands out is that the new drive has a lettername for its reserved space. Is that bad?,helpmebuildapc,cymdcu0,1,t5_39d0q
7184695,0,t3_4dtgqy,A lot of cases use molex connectors to power their fans. Make sure that if you have molex connectors comming from the case that they are plugged into your power supply.,helpmebuildapc,d1uu5as,1,t5_39d0q
7279794,0,t3_4f303c,Put it back to how it was originally before the upgrades see if it powers on. You may have a DOA PSU or GPU. Theres every chance. Oh for the i a cheap H board will be just fine. Then youll be able to use the RAM and youve got a fully working i based system.,helpmebuildapc,d25nwwl,1,t5_39d0q
7992304,0,t1_d4eeccc,Hi thanks for the quick response!Yes the Pentium was overclocked. In fact I messed up somewhere along the way and encountered a rare issue where the overclocking corrupted the BIOS. I bought a replacement motherboard to accompany the new processor. I accidentally smeared off some of the thermal paste from the heat sink upon initial installation so I bought some additional paste and cleanedreapplied some more last night which did bring down the idle temperature. The fan really isnt that noisy I was mostly curious.My old processormotherboard combo was starting to have noticeable quality issues in games framerates and system lag so I moved to replace them. That being said while the new processor is occasionally showing less frames I havent noticed any actual decrease in quality so maybe theres a disparity there between what its reporting and what Im actually getting.,helpmebuildapc,d4eeswr,1,t5_39d0q

10071561,0,t3_5jxw7z,Is this one of your first boots? If so dont forget to install your motherboards chipset drivers. Open up your control panel and go to device manager. Any icon that has a yellow exclamation triangle is a missing driver. Go to your motherboards manufacturers website and find your board and download the chipset driver. Install and reset. Now try the updated Nvidia drivers direct from Nvidia. Download the latest one and try that one. ,helpmebuildapc,dbkchxv,2,t5_39d0q
10438072,0,t3_5pevrn,If you are looking for a jack of all trades PC you wont be hitting the bounds of any of the components you listed. Id go with the  either CPU is great. GB leaves you in a great place go with x GB to leave room for expansion down the road. Honestly put this all into PCPartPicker add the peripherals you want and then grab the motherboard. Once you have that done post the link here. Hell feel free to tag me or reply here and Ill give you my two cents.Everyones willing to help just give us a more complete starting point.,helpmebuildapc,dcr8916,1,t5_39d0q
10677021,0,t3_5sk2ty,Hey late to the party and dont know if you got it working or not but you can try running off the Intel graphics and install your GPU drivers first then try seeing if it shows anything on screen. Otherwise go into the BIOS and see if you have the option for deicated GPU turned on. Good luck!,helpmebuildapc,ddh95rk,2,t5_39d0q
