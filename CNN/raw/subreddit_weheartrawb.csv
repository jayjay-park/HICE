8317962,0,t3_4thcqv,Torn Im going to say this publicly and with my name to it do not work behind the scenes anymore. Do not get involved anymore. Just stop. Stop with the obsession. Stop with helping. Stop with it all.Any issue that you get behind corrupts and twists it to feed your obsession and it will lose any possibility of succeeding. Move on with your life to something else. Finding something else. Sure be a part of the community but if you really care you wont involve yourself. Let the people who can do something do something.The fact that after all this you still want to be a part of fixing a potential issue shows a very very unhealthy obsession. Get help. Real life help from professionals.I suggest that people no longer respond. Not to the issue of the ban system but to Torn specifically. As he has shown on this subreddit it is unhealthy what he is doing here and he will seek to get the final word and to try and convince you he cares for the issue.As for you Torn I wish you all the best but dude look at what youre doing. Look at what youre saying. Look at how youre acting. Not one bit of this is healthy. The fact that you are still even talking about the ban system being a problem when Rob has directly said he doesnt want to hear from you suggests how much of an unhealthy obsession you have.Again I wish you all the best but I think you should step down and away from everything to do with Rob.,weheartrawb,d5hav5p,38,t5_3fhpm
