11546110,0,t3_64sy5m,This is one of those songs that I know will be a part of my life for a long time. Nothing Without You is fantastic! The music is super rich and dynamic and the vocals are phenomenal. The lyrics fit the musical vibe so well which is often understated in music. The production is top as well all sounds sound...top!  Gonna try and refrain from listening to the previews of each track so Im surprised on May th lol wish me luck.,EmmaBlackery,dg4r5cp,4,t5_2x7xf
