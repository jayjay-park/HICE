6471024,0,t3_446t3p,I really am amazed at the inability Android phone makers have to get a decent camera. Kodak made a phone with a legit Camera. Nokia has in the past as well. The new Asus Zenphone with the zoom lens camera is apparently soso as well. Why are good optics good CMOS and whatever DSP combined with quad core CPUs repeatedly not enough to drive a camera?,HuaweiHonor5X,czoneba,0,t5_3casr
8134066,0,t3_4mxz0d,How do the resurrection remix and stock os differ? What major features is the resurrection remix missing? Is it missing the finger print scanner? That is the only feature that I really care about.,HuaweiHonor5X,d4uccbc,1,t5_3casr

8517983,0,t1_d6078dk,One Plus  is a pretty disappointing phone coming from OPO. If you use NFC  then avoid that phone. It is still solid  however. The HonorX is meant for tinkering and following directions to flash ROMs and the like is pretty easy. You have to try to brick your phone  really. An alternative is a MotoG th generation.  I think they go for about  on Amazon.  And at Best Buy.  See if you could trade in your Honorx for that phone. ,HuaweiHonor5X,d66b3rv,1,t5_3casr
