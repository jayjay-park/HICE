55378,0,t3_1uqkds,well the death toll would be immense for obvious reasons. The size of the bomb is also important here since there are  different sizes when it comes to nukes. All of Manhattan could be gone all of NYC could be gone or even all of NYC and parts of northern New Jersey and Connecticut could go too. We are potentially talking about a death toll in the millions given a big enough bomb. Several hundred thousand in the immediate blast at least though.Then there is the whole problem with fallout. Radiation from one of those things can last for about  years so we wouldnt be able to use most of New York for the better part of two generations. We also wont be able to use whatever landwater is in the way of the prevailing winds. I cant be bothered to look that up. People that get hit with radiation but survive the blast will eventually develop cancer and die from it. Their children likely would too. You will also see a heavy number of birth defects in people who give birth after exposure.Im assuming you picked Wall Street because you would want to know the financial damage as well. The property values in Manhattan and NYC will go to shit immediately mostly because there will be no buildings there any more. That could be very bad in terms of another housing collapse. In terms of stocks and transactions Im sure in this day and age that Wall Street has some sort of back up system. You wouldnt really lose any information because stock activity is reported all over the world not just on financial news sites but also on the dozens of other stock exchanges around the world. Youd have to hit all of them simultaneously to do any real damage in terms of lost data.The real damage financially speaking will be to the system itself.

Not a problem anymore with thousands or probably even millions of females nearby. First however we could try and figure out what are their real intentions. Its unlikely a planet far beyond our solar system has an specie of humanoids nevermind one so closely related to us interbreeding is possible. And the fact they are asking us to go there instead of using their superior technology superior enough to communicate through millions of lightyears and to travel through wormholes to come here themselves could be interpreted as a trap. Either way once communication is established and a reliable way to get to the planet is discovered I dont doubt visiting that planet will become a tourist destination for those who can afford it. It will be a booming business with hundreds or thousands of scientist botanists anthropologists geologist linguist and the like all flying there to investigate how is it possible for closely related life to exist so far apart. Of course you would also see an influx of thousands maybe even millions of people moving there in a pinch. Men and women alike. A lot of countries specially the richer ones would see massive exodus and huge population drops in the first couple of years and will have to either establish measures to counter this trend or simply ban interplanetary tourist businesses in their nations. Of course this wont stop people from simply using other countrys servicesWhat happens afterwards is difficult to know.

1127917,0,t3_271h6a,First of all it should be noted that the regime in China is for all its faults though arguably this could be considered as one of the aforementioned faults is really really good at preventing movements such as this. The PRCs current policy against movements such as this one is to nip them in the bud. This can be best seen in the rather shortlived Jasmine Revolution in China which was inspired by the Arab Spring. People calling for one on the internet were arrested and police arrived in force at planned protest locations. The Tiananmen Protesters numbered in the hundreds of thousands at most with smaller protests at other cities across the country and actually had varying goals in fact the movement was arguably more anticorruption then dissatisfaction with slow modernisation then prodemocracy. For the purpose of this post Im going to assume that the protesters have similar structure and goals.A triedandtrue tactic the CPC has used in this century against protests like this is to divide and conquer. Some protesters are more easily placated than others. Minor concessions perhaps some scapegoating and  whatnot would be used to bring down the number of protesters until only a small hardcore group of protesters remain...and that significantly smaller group is much easier to ignore or to punish. There really isnt a need to call in the tanks unless things get really out of hand and a couple hundred thousand protesters in Beijing no longer require the summoning of the military. The international community talks about if for a couple weeks of the Chinese regime plays their cards particularly well some might even praise them for the relatively minor concessions theyll use then forgets about it.    ,FutureWhatIf,chwi0al,15,t5_2v3da

1342365,0,t3_29fzh1,The Sudans are generally too much of a mess to benefit for a while just like how Congo isnt able to harness its trillions of dollars of mineral wealth. But Ethiopia has a pretty good economy and political system so it can exploit its oil. For fun lets say Ethiopias oil increases total known reserves by  making Ethiopia the worlds largest holder of oil by far.After the headlines Ethiopia enters negotiations with American European and Chinese oil companies and the foreign affairs departments of those regions are also involved. Obama openly supports drilling which annoys a few Democrats but mostly gets support and the popular decision ends up helping Democrats keep the senate in the  election. In two months Ethiopia finalizes year leases with various companies. Construction for drilling systems begins immediately. Ethiopia is wooed by OPEC but ultimately declines the invitation to join  it has so much oil that obeying OPECs quotas wont help it much and local politicians are winning with an oil autonomy platform  and they want to start cashing in fast.By mid the oils flowing and petroleum prices are falling significantly around the world. In the USA average gas prices are staying under  gallon. Ethiopia invests its money is all kinds of projects. Theres plenty of pork and waste but by federal law they invest half their money in public services which makes college and healthcare free.OPEC loses most of its relevance. Ethiopia just undercuts their prices which has led some member states to defect. While it still exists on paper OPEC doesnt really have influence. The petrostates who belong or did belong to it are experiencing mounting political problems  for years theyve depended on oil revenue to pay for expenditures and keep their publics happy but the moneys vanishing fast. In  most developed nations are experiencing pretty good economic growth from the cheap fuel. In the USA Obamas approval ratings rise over  in his last year. His last major act is to actually get an immigration reform bill through Congress  with the help of quite a few Republicans in the Southwest who are worried about their standing with Hispanic voters. Of course it comes with a tax cut to grease the wheels. Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election.In  Chinese motorcycles and mini cars start impacting the European and American auto markets in a big way. Baghdad falls to ISIS.In fall  two major oil pipelines in Ethiopia are attacked  one is destroyed killing a dozen people but the second is only mildly damaged. Two weeks later an official inside the Ethiopian government leaks the fact that Iranian saboteurs were behind the attack. Iran denies it but goes overboard when it claims that the men Ethiopia has captured arent even Iranian citizens which is quickly disproven. Some Ethiopians are calling the attack an act of war and theres even some support for war from the people who are feeling empowered by their recent years of prosperity. However the event is a huge scandal in Iran. Multiple resignations happen within a week but the people having been frustrated already by the last couple of years of economic downturn arent satisfied. Mass protests occur in multiple cities. The government overreacts in some cases and protesters are killed. Iran begins sliding into a civil war. ISIS takes advantage and begins sending soldiers to Iran. Iran declares war on ISIS  which is functionally a declaration of war against most of Iraq. The Supreme Leader also indicates that they will not make distinctions between foreign terrorists or citizen protesters hoping nationalism will end their uprising. It does not. Protests only grow creating more confrontations. The EU USA and China dont act yet  they have no idea how to respond to the situation. The IranISIS war has too many dimensions  theocrats v. secularists Sunni v. Shia Iran v. Iraq state v. terrorists. However after bombing an ISISheld city in Iraq China and the USA come to an agreement with the remnants of the old Iraqi government to create a nofly zone over Iraq. In Iran social media rapidly spreads images of the bombing and the aftermath. Iranians say their reckless government is drawing them into too much war.After an order to suppress protests with lethal force the Iranian military announces it is seizing power to protect the people. It calls for the creation of a new constitution which the people support. It also calls off all attacks in Iraq although it remains ruthless against ISIS in its own borders. By January  a messy plebiscite validates the new constitution  the theocracy is mostly abolished. Its only legal power now is to call for new elections but not more often than once every two years. China recognizes the new government swiftly. The USA is slower to do so with Hillary Clinton wary of making a political mistake. However as public opinion grows ever more against ISIS and its Talibanstyle operations the USA agrees to support the new secular government of Iran against ISIS. The two nations cooperate militarily to take out ISIS.,FutureWhatIf,cikmqzg,26,t5_2v3da

1912430,0,t3_2g4tti,You know how to best take over a small town in the US? Move in enough people that they own the majority vote then you can do pretty much everything. Its also not without precedenceI actually started writing up a story but I cant figure out why they would do this. ISIS has grassroots support in its region it has funding it has income sources infrastructure and a pool of disillusioned Syrians and Iraqis to draw from.What would capturing a US town by ISIS entail anyway? Do you round up every able bodied adult into a central place and keep them there? How do you deal with feeding and cleaning them? Itll be hard enough to feed the  ISIS members in each town but you also need to feed  civilians. That will take . TONS of food every day. In Iraq and Syria they are an invading army with lots of grassroots support so you can either flee from the front or you can stay and join up. Here theres no front theres no logistical chain behind them.And to what end? This could only really end one way a drawn out hostage situation that ends with all of their members dead or in jail. Losses among the townsfolk would be between  and  of those captured. There really is no end game the US cannot let these people go. A few try to escape but they are hunted down and brought to justice.A side effect of the attack would be to make the overt discrimination of American muslims socially acceptable. Many will tell you how poorly they were treated after the  attacks but that would be nothing compared to what would happen now. Those  ISIS members would have been in the US for a while. They would have had to have support from embedded locals to both get them in supply them with the vehicles weapons and info to pull off their attack. Massive sweeps are preformed to find those supporters and tens of thousands of innocent muslims get swept up in that net. Small jurisdictions implementing registration for muslims is something I can see happening for a few years before the case hits the Supreme Court and those laws are overturned.At the end of the day the US gets the moral and legal authority to go into Syria and Iraq with guns blazing. Sure the attack would increase ISIS their fundraising and rally a few more people to their cause but it would turn the worlds eyes on them and the vast majority wont like what they see. Funding in Europe would dry up as local muslims would see what effect the attacks had on their brothers living in the US and would fear similar treatment in their home countries.The US would call up a coalition that would make Desert Storm look like a weekend war game. There would be no doubt there would be no talk of negotiation. England Germany France Poland the Scandinavian countries Spain et al would be lining up to send men ships and planes. This was not an attack by a small terrorist group against a few buildings it was a declaration of war by a selfdeclared nationstate and every European nation knows they could be next.And for the next  years idiots on the internet call it a false flag and a pretext for going to war in Iraq and Syria again.,FutureWhatIf,ckjmw44,1,t5_2v3da

3469698,0,t3_2zzfkz,The first signals blanketinterrupt all but the most powerful transmitting channels.  Coming from an incredibly close source the megawatt range squawks of radio noise cause a momentary worldwide pause.  The signals are structured artificial...and not local.  Their sheer power precludes any coverup or passing off as localised sunspot activity.Top scientists work on the signal.  initial speculation is a freak solar blast. but that changes to a suspected inspace nuclear detonation of some kind.  Russia blames the US the US blames Russia China blames the US India blames Pakistan the UK blames Russia Ukraine blames Russia Russia changes its story and blames China.  China blames Japan.In the midst of this international blamegame a second more targeted signal is received.  This one uses television protocols to send audio and visual information.  The signal is picked up across Europe and consists of a man in a strange suit speaking gibberish.  Linguists say it has a very faint passing similarity to ancient Sumerian syntax but is otherwise incomprehensible.  Discussion is trending to the signal being some sort of wierd viral prank when NASA and the ESA make a cautious report that the Cassini probe around Saturn has detected additional unidentified nonnatural objects.Telescopes and radio arrays frantically scan Saturnian space and get the full brunt of a third transmission.  This one is in badly broken Spanish and appears to be an attempt to map a recorded TV or radio sound to the Sumerianesque gibberish.  It roughly translates to a request to allow an approach.Top diplomats and linguists respond with a transmission detailing the English French Spanish and what we know of the Sumerian language.  Russia lodges a strong protest in the UN at the lack of Cyrillic in the message and China states they are sending their own message with a SpanishMandarin translation matrix.Two days later a spatial distortion opens in Low Earth Orbit and a large spacecraft emerges.  It adjusts its orbit to close in on the International Space Station.  The spacecraft dwarfs the station so much that the ISS is forced coursecorrect to account for its gravitational presence.  The ship is visible from the ground as a cigarshaped spindle near the station.The United States preempts a multinational UN contact mission and makes contact with the craft using the pretext that the ISS and craft was over US airspace at the time.  At the same time an executive order freezes the international banking markets in place.The messages are initially classified as Top Secret but leak to both Democrat and Republican parties and from there to the news media within hours.  Facing extreme domestic and international backlash the negotiations are hurriedly declassified by the President although significant sections remain redacted.China and Russia announce they have also made contact.  Russia publishes a strangely slanted version of the correspondence.  China classifies its communications for the public good.Looselyaffiliated hacktivist groups such as Anonymous spring into action and full uncensored transcripts appear on Wikileaks and The Pirate Bay within hours.The gist of the communications make three fundamental points.  First Earthhumanity is simply one of many colonies of humans in the galaxy.  The true homeworld of Huma was sterilized in a galactic war thirtythousand years ago which also destroyed the Human Empire and cut off all its colonyworlds.Second the United Confederation of Humanity has been recontacting and reclaiming former Imperial Colony Worlds for the last five thousand years.  Earth was listed as a simple Outpost with a mere seven family groups on a groundbreaking mission.Third standard Huma protocol for colonization involved settling Seeded planets and Earth was seeded nearly three billion years ago by another race called the Precursors.  Huma the Empire and the Confederation all have nearidentical biospheres to Earth.Permission for diplomats to land is granted but multiple landing sites are given  the US interior Central Africa Siberia China and the United Nations plaza in New York.  the Confederation representatives choose instead to land in Switzerland as it has a history of neutrality  proving a that they have tapped into our Internet and are capable of reading our history with startling speed and b this may not be their first dance when it comes to contacting divided Human worlds.The diplomats agree to a frankly invasive barrage of identification tests  DNA CAT Scans XRays and blood tests are used to verify the visitors are human.  They unequivocally are with mixedrace ancestry and identical chromosomal structure.  The lead Confederate diplomat is even of blood type BPositive.As one biologist puts it  Theyre so human that if theyre alien we cannot tell the differenceThe message comes out that the Confederation is offering membership in their organization.  There is strong public pressure to accept especially after the visitors demonstrate medical technology in advance of anything on Earth as well as promising access to the FTL drive and other scientific advances.All Earth has to do is sign on the dotted line and agree to abide by Confederation rules.Governments are forced onto the back foot by the Confederation tactic of widearea public broadcasting of the negotiations which the complete opposite of the normal closeddoor highlevel talks that have become the international diplomatic norm.Public pressure mounts on elected officals to accept the deal.  Politicians drag their feet expressing concerns about sovereignty and economic stability.  The markets have been frozen for neatly six weeks now since the ship arrived in orbit and time is swiftly running out.  They cannot be halted indefinitely and enough has already happened for massive selloffs to be guaranteed.  To reopen the markets is to invite a financial disaster.As talks extend into the night a massive terror attack rocks Geneva.  A masked representative of a group called the Guardians of Earth demands the Confederates leave immediately citing objectionable clauses in their proposal.Russia withdraws from the talks and cites that they will not abide by the antidemocratic measures the Confederates are proposing.  China refuses to publicly comment but a source in the Japanese delegation mentions they are roadblocking the proposal due to it being against revolutionary principles.Public opinion initially overwhelming proannexation is coming out more mixed.  To join the Confederation will cause massive job losses as the influx of technology supercedes industry and that shortfall may not be made up by new positions.  The economic engine of the world is still locked as it was weeks ago and economists are predicting a severe depression no matter the outcome of the talks.An economist states This is what the Indians felt when Columbus explained what was coming More movements like the Guardians of Earth are springing up as radicals are given the time to get themselves organised.  The initial GoE attack is still under investigation when a bomb detonates at a mass rally outside the UN in New York killing dozens.  The Freedom Fighters of America claim responsibility.The talks end a month later.  Public dissatisfaction is at an alltime high as no concrete deal is reached.  The Confederation will be permitted to maintain a base in the Saturnian system and may visit Earth visas to be strictly controlled by a new World body  the Earth Nations Alliance  that will replace the UN. National Sovereignty will remain intact but authority for extraterrestrial contacts will be granted to this new body.  It will be controlled by democratic elections of representatives from all eligible countries  barring the permanent seats for the US China Saudi Arabia UK Israel France Germany Canada and India.Pakistan Spain Egypt South Africa and Indonesia immediately demand their own seats or threaten to not recognize the ENA and initiate contact on their own with the Confederation.As the Confederation ship leaves orbit the first cruise missile strikes take out the power and transmitters in Brazil Pakistan South Africa and Indonesia.  Peacekeepers are already enroute to dissenting countries as emergency war measures are placed over ENA member countries.Noone is entirely sure if that may not have been the ultimate endgame of the Confederates or not...,FutureWhatIf,cpnrqwi,108,t5_2v3da

Effectively the race for the  is anyones to win  which is why Bernie Sanders who despite his many virtues is currently doing pretty well considering how unlikely the idea would have seemed in the past.That said one of the biggest criticisms of Fiorina and Carson is that theyve never held elected office which is why their political aspirations seem more like an attempt to raise their profile for future speaking tours and book deals than any real attempt at entering the political arena. For someone like Colbert to win hed need to counteract that as an inevitable criticism and the only way to do that is to go for a lesser political office  Senator or Congressman. A couple of years of that where he could make his name as someone who actually tries to do the right thing rather than the politicallymotivated thing which as a political outsider would be his biggest selling point however true it was and hed be in a good position to step up for the next election cycle.

Nearly every  term president since the depression has experienced both good and bad economic times at some point during their time in office.However while a president cant trigger or end a recession alone his policies can worsen or shorten one through both perception and realworld effects.If Sanders is elected and the next recession really hits during  hell probably respond with an eat the rich policy if Congress and the Fed will play ball.  This will result in wealthy individuals and multinational businesses putting their money out of the United States and therefore out of his reach.  The policies that trigger this will be popular among his voters but the net effect will be a lengthening of the lean years and a chilling effect on domestic hiring.  In a healthy economy these measures might not halt all growth but in a sick one they will slow recovery.There are a variety of policies in between the new deal and Greek austerity and they do have measurable results based on past examples.  Its worth remembering that the US was the only major industrialized nation that really stuck it to businesses during the depression in addition to the expanded welfare state and was also the only major economy to suffer a double dip spike in unemployment in the late s.  Sourced for the US here I do not have statistics handy for other nations but unemployment in the UK France German Weimar Republic and other large economies fell gradually through the s and did not spike.One thing is clear a large welfare state with a weak economy will always result in unchecked expansion of the national debt FDR and Obama and may include a credit rating downgrade.  This is not something a nation can refuse to address forever since all debts are eventually settled either by future generations or by immediate defaultausterity.Tldr Bernie wont cause a recession alone but his policies can certainly make one last longer.

8023474,0,t3_4p4f2d,First of all this FWI is pretty unrealistic. Even many of those who are progun control dont advocate for such drastic measures. Many of them advocate for common sense measures or even an assault weapon ban but not this far. Not to mention this would require a repeal of the Second Amendment which needs a  state majority to ratify. For the sake of the FWI lets pretend this does happen. Best case scenario The Supreme Court finds the law unconstitutional and invalidates the law citing the Second Amendment. Worst case scenario The law passes successfully law enforcement start to enforce the new law. Many law abiding citizens turn in their guns but a good chunk of them choose not to. Criminals of course choose not to comply. This is the sort of situation that was talked about by gun deregulation advocates the government literally out to disarm an entire population. People are up in arms saying the government has become corrupt. People protest the new law and many outright refuse to cooperate. Many states dont have any registration requirements so many people are able to keep their guns hidden. Law enforcement doesnt have the authority to search peoples homes without a warrant. There are also several states who just outright refuse to enforce the law. If the federal government decides to use the military to enforce the law this could get ugly fast. ,FutureWhatIf,d4hwwdg,7,t5_2v3da

8396749,0,t3_4umu4i,This is already happening in the urban areas with the highest crime and most hazardous work for police forces.The endgame solution is to end the war on drugs.  Aside from the revenuegenerating enforcement of traffic violations the majority of law enforcement activity has to do with the drug trade.  As long as drugs remain illegal their price will be higher than the free market would otherwise dictate.  Law enforcement can put away small dealers but higher tiered dealers can afford to insulate themselves from prosecution so that even when one does go away theyre grossly outnumbered by people willing and able to replace them due to the taxfree and overinflated prices of the product they sell.The US prison population is  nonviolent drug offenders and hardened criminals are often released due to mandatory sentencing laws that keep drug offenders in prison longer than violent criminals.So as states have begun legalizing marijuana the unintended consequence is that cartels take a direct hit to their bottom line.  Taxpaying businesses have brought massive revenues to states like Colorado and if this business model were expanded to opiates and stimulants most of the illegal drug trade would disappear within months.If the illegal drug trade is gone police must put away the actual violent criminals or face budget cuts.  This means no more stop and frisk fewer roadblock checkpoints and fewer people with a reason to withhold info from law enforcement.  It wont get better overnight but this is how it eventually can.,FutureWhatIf,d5r52ms,9,t5_2v3da

There is no precedent on what happens when a president advocates extrajudicial execution but capital punishment for nonviolent drug offenses is highly unconstitutional in the US.Black Lives Matter loses their shit. False accusations are not uncommon and in many states allegations of drug dealing are racially charged see Maine for instance. Its quite possible that some elements within the antipolice brutality movement turn to terrorism up to and including a Beslanstyle siege on innocents this would likely backfire. Racial tension soars to levels unseen since the s if not worse.A number of countries with large black or darkskinned Asian populations issue travel warnings on the US expressing concern that drug claims could be used to justify extrajudicial police killings. Some countries where drug use is effectively decriminalized such as Canada Portugal and the Netherlands allow temporary asylum for Americans particularly those of color until the policy is rescinded or reduced.States that have legalized or decriminalized marijuana medical or otherwise continue prosecuting vigilantes under state law.

Our entire Universe is a sandbox.In  the ESA publishes a paper they link RF resonant cavity thruster impossible thrust to a repeating loop pattern. This would become the first discovered exoverse code construct.In  a DEFCON presentation talks about using the thruster to exploit the simulation using what is known as a buffer overflow attack.In  SpaceX produce working prototypes of crafts powered by microwaves.In  a hackaton is launched where hackers from around the world try to exploit the exoverse using the thrusters. This hackaton produced amazing results with a team managing to succesfully align the thrusters to feed the exoverse loop with more data than it could handle thus causing any acceleration to suddenly drop. Strangely enough during the overflow attack the acceleration of the craft greatly increases.In  experiments reveal that during an exploit the crafts acceleration increases at a high rate and after a succesful exploit the crafts acceleration resets to the values before the attack began all this without affecting the current velocity and position. Constant free and boundless acceleration.In  clocks attached to the crafts produce interesting results when the acceleration stops the clocks revert to the time displayed when the buffer overflow attack started.In  ESA NASA and SpaceX merge into PSA the Planetary Space Agency and produce working prototypes of crafts powered by microwaves that would reset their inner state while maintaining position and acceleration. Ground test with bacteria show no adverse effects to the state reset. More experiments continue with mammals and primates.In  PSA announces plans to build a craft capable of interstellar travel.In  Enterprise is launched.

Itll be hard for the EU to collapse if eurosceptic parties remain in the minority meaning that you have either a internal disconnectsfeuds between the members that result in the EU fracturing into two or more successors or b an increase in leftwing and centrist euroscepticism. The rump Canadacontinental EU NATO would likely look very different and could explicitly have a socialdemocratic tinge. I do believe that if Russia did target a NATO or unaligned Nordic country youd likely see significant pressure on either the US or UK to help out. A lot of Americans and Brits still support NATO and at least youd see something similar to the Spanish Civil War in which American volunteers fought in the conflict.

11448510,0,t3_63b18c,There are quite a few steps between an election and an armed insurrection.Recall that  and  saw the Democrats in control of the White House and both houses of congress.  There wasnt an uprising but there was a major aboutface by the electorate and congress flipped in the next midterm election.  As we saw in the s Hillarycare failed to pass even then and the  AWB was allowed to sunset in .  Obamas signature legislation has been under fire since it was rammed through in  and probably wont survive until the  midterms.  In both cases Clinton and Obama both had a congress determined to halt their agenda at every step and they largely succeeded in doing so.So for an armed insurrection idea to be taken seriously by more than a few thousand malcontents a future president probably a Democrat would have to do something highly illegal such as suspending congress or gun confiscation or wealth redistribution through executive order at gunpoint.
