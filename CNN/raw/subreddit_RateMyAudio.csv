67390,0,t3_1utdfp,Hey very nice composition! nice variety there. IMO The double bass? verb could perhaps do with a bit of high passing. The Piano sounds a little thin perhaps but not really a big deal. The pizz strings sound real nice. The snare drum sounds a little wobbly loose snare perhaps with not enough snap for me I would have liked it to sound a little more military. At .ish you can hear some kind of airy woosh under the piano when it plays Im not sure what this is perhaps the reverb? Nice descent into discord at .. Perhaps a little high tremolo string over . would add some top and tension? The percussion drum sounds dont seem to cleanly drop out at .. Just some thoughts. Overall very nice!,RateMyAudio,cem3ou4,3,t5_2vewi
353620,0,t3_1y547t,To clarify Im the drummer in this band Moustache Latte but was also acting as producer and worked closely with the engineer during recording and mixing. It was recorded in a house not a studio and mixed in a room which I would say was quasiacoustically treated.Id like to hear critiques and feedback on the mix particularly because were recording with the same person again in two weeks to complete the debut EP  and would like some objective notes on what is weak in this initial recording. Personally I am quite happy with it particularly the drum sound though the eq on the overheads might be a little harsh. Perhaps the vocals could be better but I cant quite place why or how. Thanks!,RateMyAudio,cfhf4hf,1,t5_2vewi

815617,0,t1_cgwz3sq,Not something I regularly do at all when close micing but when I shut the lid on that C and need to keep the vocals from bleeding in cardioids end up being way to heavy on the attack. Just too much percussion from the hammers for this type of recording. I use omnis for recording solo piano at a distance a lot but not at home with this piano. My typical choice is the DPA set for close micing but I had loaned them out this week. ,RateMyAudio,cgwzm4b,1,t5_2vewi
863977,0,t3_240prx,Is there only one guitar track recorded sounds like it to me? If you could get a second take doubling the already recorded part and pan the two tracks Right and Left I think your mix would benefit from the open space. It sounds pretty good as is and it fits nicely within the typical style of this genre. All of the instruments are audible. If the guitars were wider I think the vocal would have a bit more space and the song would seem a bit larger and deeper. ,RateMyAudio,ch2hmvm,1,t5_2vewi

1685040,0,t3_2dmxfc,That was a wild ride! I liked the tonal contrast in the first  minutes. I like that youre going to rerecord the guitar performance. I think adding some dynamics and expressivity to the guitar would help build interest.I also want to hear more bass somewhere in the hz range.

1938151,0,t1_ckmqdo1,These are the same complaints Ive had after listening to it again. I recording and mixed it all day yesterday...so with fresh ears today I fixed a few things. Im having trouble turning down the vocal overdrive believe it or not....Ill figure it out soon enough. The guitar really stepped away from the vocals when I did some eqing. Havent fixed the pop at the end. Haha. Too many things to think about. The bass and kick really come through much better now. Take a listen to this one if you would. ,RateMyAudio,ckmqmwn,1,t5_2vewi

2691446,0,t3_2qvcw4,Those are some beefy ass drum tones. I like it. My only thing is I think Id like to hear some harder and a tiny bit faster compression on the kick and snare so you dont hear the tail so much. Also theres something about the cymbals that Im not liking. I think they need more sparkle maybe In the khz range. Were the drums sampled that way? Or did you beef them up your self? Either way very well done on the mix. ,RateMyAudio,cn9w3ua,1,t5_2vewi
2855555,0,t3_2ssb7g,I felt that some of the drum hits at the end were a little loud.Sometimes I felt that the lead guitar was a little too loud or panned too center.

3266553,0,t3_2vaar7,Excellent playing with very precise technique. Very impressive. My only suggestion would be to try splitting the bass guitar signal with a D.I. box and run that signal clean into a channel put a low pass filter on it then hard limit the daylights out of it Dump everything below hrz and a slight boost at Hz and Hz to compensate. Then bleed a bit of that into the mix. Heavy distortion on the bass  neuters t he low end,RateMyAudio,cp0m3p3,2,t5_2vewi

4183968,0,t3_38pgsi,The lead sounded very full. The synth that was playing the melody was placed interestingly it make it kind of psychedelic. Good use of panning the high hats. The drum kick didnt sound tight enough sounded quite muffled and didnt sound completely tight. Thats just my taste for kicks though. Overall the mix wasnt bad,RateMyAudio,crx6bjf,1,t5_2vewi
4313735,0,t3_39si12,I think only in rare cases does a reverb on the kick work out. For one it takes away from the punch and energy of a song inevitably making it sound weak. Also try putting the hihat panned to one ear. I think that will help you add depth. ,RateMyAudio,csbvufx,1,t5_2vewi
4366607,0,t3_3969mr,I like the vocals a lot. I think the sounds go really well with the vocals. I think it has some catchy rhythms. I would say since you are doing hiphop I would try and move into a pop structure format in the future. You kind of have a chorus section but it is basically the same minus the kick changing a little bit.  minutes of the same exact stuff gets very redundant. I do like the sounds a lot like I said but definitely change things up as the song progresses. Introduce new elements and dont be afraid to take stuff out. Overall good stuff and I hope some of this helped!,RateMyAudio,cshuo9n,1,t5_2vewi

5181240,0,t3_3ly249,This is a really cool track howd you fit so many different parts into a track impressive. Some things that I think... The hats could be a little bit crispier maybe a little high end boost or hi pass filtering snare a little louder and punchier and the acoustic guitar the one in the beginning sounds like it has a little bit extra low endroom build up.
