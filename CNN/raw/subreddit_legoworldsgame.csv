4164179,0,t1_crutfto,the liquides flow integration is already planned.  the control and camera definitly need improvement and the cinematics regularly taking control of what you look is really annoying.,legoworldsgame,cruxbza,2,t5_38ey5

5168449,0,t1_cv76rbj,It took me  hours to collect  construction vehicles  good normal vehicles heli is SLOOOW plane is good  animals I really like bear and horse are all you need and about  characters of which I bought . After you bought the chars you can use their clothes on your custom minifig.You need some items for specific animals and characters like a pistol for a cowboy which you then lose but you can get another as soon as you gave it away.It took me equally long to find a good place to settle down. Some worlds have lots of mountains everywhere and I wanted space for a small city so I switched to another world and found one with lots of islands. I kept all my progress like minifigs animals money etc.Oh yeah one important tip. Dont build the house from the  set thats in the game right now accidentally demolish everything with the lawn mower and make another house right on top of the first. Youll get duplicate items in the same location youll get vehicles on top of vehicles and you cant get rid of the cars. They keep spawning whatever you do to them. There might be a fix but youll prob have to manually delete it from the save file not sure yet how. And bazookas blow up environment and you cant repair it. You cant find the right color often its a bit of a pain to get it all level and youll always see it. So planning is important if youre a little nitpicky about how its gonna turn out. Also you need a steam roller for roads and a digger to make the ground nice and level. And the big drill can make tunnels so you can connect islands to eachother with a nice tunnel.And the most important tip of all. Change camera to Tracking. Suddenly you can actually drive vehicles and walk through tunnels!Woah long post. Sadly I cant embed a pic of a potato xD,legoworldsgame,cv8zlbc,1,t5_38ey5

11036907,0,t1_dei3ac0,I have only played the Early access version and so far you can build  buildings or more.Just as much as you can in Minecraft. But the release version has some size restrictions. You can still build  if you can ,legoworldsgame,dej0ig9,1,t5_38ey5

11100875,0,t3_5yezwx,Depends on what you enjoyed most about Minecraft. Players who simply liked to build cool shit will probably really enjoy Lego Worlds. Users who enjoyed the Survival aspects of Minecraft probably wont enjoy Lego Worlds too much. I personally love it but I generally love any video game that allows you to build your own creations with great detail which is one of the reasons I got bored with Minecraft theres only so much you can do with such large blocks.,legoworldsgame,deq9w5l,2,t5_38ey5

11163011,0,t3_5zd5pi,its a bit glitch at the moment but I assume theyll fix it soon.,legoworldsgame,dexbdan,2,t5_38ey5
11164066,0,t1_dex5cpq,IIRC It wasnt in the same city. You might have to find a different city.,legoworldsgame,dexfo95,1,t5_38ey5
11165045,0,t1_dexhljn,I think they can probably improve it on consoles yes but I think its always going to have a few frame rate type issues due to the nature of the way the world renders etc I can see PCs being much better for it long term. Maybe when the Xbox Scorpio comes out it may fair a bit better also.As it stands the game is still good fun but any vehicle movement on console is a little disappointing if Im honest. ,legoworldsgame,dexjo04,2,t5_38ey5
11170683,0,t1_dey2vo5,On PS you can delete the save data on the console and download one of the cloud saves in its place. That should fix this issue at least on PS. Not sure on Xbox and since Steam doesnt have cloud storage I think PC is SOL unless you manually back up your saves.,legoworldsgame,dey6o50,3,t5_38ey5

11680405,0,t3_66nvrn,You cant open a chest under water. You have to use the landscape tool to remove the water terrain from the highest point and drill down! then when you get to the chest there will be no water and you can open it. Need to start from the top though.,legoworldsgame,dgjzo55,2,t5_38ey5
11682379,0,t1_dgk6yue,Ps version and the worst Ive had was a corrupt save  that reverted back to the same exact save from the pscloud. Lost no data and kept going. Happened  times.        It seems to be the XBOne version with the most issues. ,legoworldsgame,dgk7qar,1,t5_38ey5
11683027,0,t1_dgk97hp,Yep that is a quick easy one to discover.  Also Swamp Monster and Deep Sea Diver can walk under water as well.,legoworldsgame,dgkadpk,1,t5_38ey5
