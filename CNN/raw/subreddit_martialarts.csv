126153,0,t1_cesnx46,I agree you shouldnt just take people on their word and look at all things with a critical mindset. However it is way to easy to write something off as ineffective before you know the whole picture. Especially on a internet forum where you cant actually see their training or how it works. Skepticism should be applied to everything especially in the TMAs. A good technique is not a static movement that is only effective when applied one way it changes with who is using it and can be adapted to be more effective depending on the ones personal mechanics. A tremendous amount of thought and effort are put into not only doing a technique right like perfecting a kata but also into how it would be used. The theory is only half the effort making it work is the real battle. That being said I completely disagree with the concept that not all ideas have the same merit. Maybe not all ideas are as effective as others but your opinion is just as valid as anyone elses. When you stop listening to others point of view you effectively stop yourself from learning anything new. In a subculture where people will spend their whole lives trying to perfect a very marginalized technique it just becomes all too easy to let egos get in the way and make it personal. You arent just questioning their training and style but the importance of the culture that they are striving to preserve and all the effort theyve put into it. This short excerpt from Zen in the Martial Arts is pretty much spoton  It is about the Japanese Zen master who received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen. It was obvious to the master from the start of the conversation that the professor was not so much interested in learning about Zen as he was in impressing the master with his own opinions and knowledge. The master listened patiently and finally suggested they have tea. The master poured his visitors cup full and then kept on pouring. The professor watched the cup overflowing until he could no longer restrain himself. The cup is overfull no more will go in. Like the cup the master said you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup? ,martialarts,cesspc7,2,t5_2qkt4

172408,0,t3_1w06t5,I am not a heavy set person and no matter how hard I try I can never gain weightmuscle. I am however rather agile and nimble. So when I say light I mean I want a martial art that allows me to use my agility and nimbleness is that a word? to be powerful and evasive as in dodging attacks and such without having to be very muscular or heavy. I say lethal because I want to be just that. Imagine the technique of say Shaolin with the lethality of Krav Maga. I want a martial art that doesnt require me to be able to flip someone over my shoulder or jump on them and drag them to the ground because the fact is I simply cant do those things but a martial art that still allows me to damage them in some way. Whether thats attacking their nervous system or hitting pressure points really hard.

Much like jeet kune do it cannot be taught directly but the ideas and philosophy behind it can be passed on. You cannot teach a person how to control their own energy although they can discover it themselves and build from that to have better control of their energy flow.The kids who ask their sensei to teach them chi is most likely thinking that theyll just go through a couple steps or moves as then they suddenly have access to super human strength which really is just completely bollocks.,martialarts,cf8gbu3,-7,t5_2qkt4

Just like fighting experience isnt something you can learn. It just comes from time spent doing it. If you drive everyday and something falls everyday you will be pretty good at avoiding it. If it never does you wont be good at it but its not really needed.Same can be said of martial arts. If you dont experience it regularly you wont be good at it but if you do you will.

I was sitting next to two guys from another outofstate karate school it was an open tournament. We were chatting and joking quite cordially. ...Then a more senior student from the school walks over to the guys and says Sensei says first person to break their opponents nose gets a steak dinner! Both guys are like WORD! THAT STEAK DINNER IS MINE! Ref comes around points to me and one of the guys says You two up first! We square off ref says to shake hands. I grab his hand pull him in and say Im not your steak dinner bud. The guys eyes get really big. Ref says go and I lunge forward with a front kick straight to his chest. He falls over right on his back. It was free sparring so he gets up and I proceed to essentially chase him around the mat for  rounds hammering him with roundhouse kicks to the midsection.

You can play the same game where only pulling is allowed or where the opponents have to start with their fingers entwined with each others.Another one is chicken fighting which is a Korean thing.  You hold one of your feet up near your groin with the opposite hand.  Then you hop around on one leg and push the other people over.  If you let go and step down you are out.You can also do sock wrestling tuck a sock in each persons belt at the back then pair up and they have to get the sock off their opponent first.  You do it standing or you could do it sitting where they have the sock put on only half way on one foot.

You are developing explosive strengh that will give you the burst speed and quickness necessary to martial arts. Second is HIIT High intensity interval training. this is taking and exercise preferably compound lift with a low weight and going all out for    seconds then taking a break for    seconds. Then repeat a dozen times. This trains the system for the explosive bursts you need when sparringrolling. The interval depends on your conditioning and what your style demands.

490182,0,t3_1zpd2d,Size doesnt really matter. All martial arts can be learned its not like there is one specifically for really tall people I would be all over it. Its just that size gives different advantages. My general idea is that height gives advantage to striking arts and is a disadvantage in throwinggrappling arts like judo. But regardless of which type if you do it long enough you will be able to make it work for you and use your body type to your advantage.If I had to suggest I would say Judo as it gives a huge advantage to short people against tall people and introducing someone to pavement usually ends a fight pretty quickly.,martialarts,cfvzjos,0,t5_2qkt4

828875,0,t3_23lely,I think someone with an Aikido background would do particularly well in a zeroG fight.  The art is based on using and redirecting the opponents momentum against them.  In zerog there is no ground from which to brace yourself so if one leaps off toward an opponent in order to make an attack the defender can grab twist and send you spinning in another direction.  You dont necessarily need to do damage to the attacker just the act of sending them spinning will be useful for the attack will be disorientated and need to spend time and energy stoping the spin which will give you time to prepare your next move or escape.  Also if you are fighting outside of a vessel you might be able to send them hurtling into the endless void which wouldnt be fun for them.If this is the case you would also need to know how it will affect your own momentum.  Your best bet would be to stay rooted or attached to some surface or another.  I think anyone leaping off in to free space would be at a serious disadvantage.Also wrist locks and the like would still have some effectiveness.  If you get an opponent spinning then wrench their wrists or joints in the opposite direction there would still be enough inertial from the spinning body to put torque on the joint to cause damage.  If done quickly enough this still might be effective against a nonspinning target too however I imagine you would need to really wrench it.I think they did this in the battle room of Enders Game when the bullies all ganged up on Ender.,martialarts,cgyhtop,1,t5_2qkt4

I think good aikido judo and bjj are really similar that way.  But when learning bjj I wanna get everything I can from the teacher so Im mostly trying to do what they teach me.  Since bjj usually has a modern teaching pedagogy in regards to human anatomy and the sort of chess game that goes into manipulating yours and someone elses body structure that works for me and carries over into aikido practice much moreso than some of the people out there who go for the mystical mumbo jumbo or wanna teach by not really teaching just showing or worse standing around rambling.That feeling of being submitted by someone and not knowing what the heck they did to get you there that feeling of them being like trying to grapple with a greased pig or a shadow is really similar to trying to strike at grab or take down a really good aikido person though.

Its near the bottom mixed in with a bunch of other rules so its easy to miss.  Dont bother looking for it its hard to find heres the quote.gtThe Titfortat rule is a way for fighters equalize fouls that are not sufficiently acknowledged or enforced by the referee.  The recipient of a foul that is not sufficiently acknowledged or enforced by the referee is allowed  reasonably equal foul of his own to equalize the fouls.  This is to ensure one fighter does not gain unfair advantage by a foul that itself is insufficient to cause a DQ or point deduction but still gives the fighter an advantage.  The most common implementation of the titfortat rule is to return the identical foul e.g. groin shot for groin shot but the returned foul need not be identical e.g. elbows to the back of the head for biting like a bitch.,martialarts,cijixh0,15,t5_2qkt4

1389809,0,t1_ciqh5wr,It isnt so much how often you do it as the way you do it. Boxers tend to have really exaggerated head motion because dodging a punch entirely is better than dodging a punch partially. Kickboxers move their heads a lot too but they dont go quite as low. They occasionally get clipped even on a successful Bob or weave but its far better to get hit in the dome than the chin and if they went lower kicks would become a problem. In Muay Thai you dont even want to go as low as in kickboxing. The biggest threat while you Bob and weave is a knee strike. If you are training a style of Muay Thai that utilizes more head movement dutch style uses a lot of head movement as do some american nak Muay. The Thai style seriously avoids it you want to bob and weave a lot just like a boxer does but in a far less exaggerated way considering glancing blows to be successful dodges.,martialarts,ciqhsjm,3,t5_2qkt4

1406795,1,t1_cisl59j,First off you dont even know what hes talking about. I dont know what it is. It could be a pilatestype thing. You should ask before you assume.Second mantra is not inherently magical. Hail mary is a mantra. No one actually expects it to do anything other than give the sayer a peace of mind. Its just a chant. Third there are much better ways to go about addressing him if you so feel inclined. I dont believe in any deity but I wouldnt walk into a Micky D and yell There is no beef in these burgers just like there is no god. That is kind of what you are doing. He believes something you dont. You should address it as such. Say that you dont think poses are good. Actually explain your position rather than assuming you are correct and saying he is wrong. And again you dont know what exactly he is talking about. I dont. Dont assume you know what it is or that he is pretending to do magic.Fourth in regards to that previous question it was on its way to starting a crap on WC thread. HKBFG is well known to have animosity towards it and I highly doubt he didnt have the intent to explain every reason why he doesnt like it even though that was not asked by the poster. So it was irrelevant whether or not his animosity is well earned. He didnt want opinions on it. Dont give your opinion when its not asked for. Its pretty simple. But this is a different thing. Here an opinion was asked the problem is you gave what could be considered a rude answer. There is nothing wrong with starting discussion but that is different than starting it via antagonizing and aggravating dissent. Glenn Beck uses very aggressive tactics that start lots of discussion but it doesnt excuse how he starts them. You can do it much more reasonably. Thats all Im saying. Listen man I have a lot of respect for you but as of late I have seen you become jaded and less respectful and objective than you used to. Its okay to have opinions but its not okay to let them become everything about you. You used to give really good explanations of what you thought and why you thought so but recently youre just assuming there is one true opinion and anyone who thinks otherwise is given the brush. I think its because youve been spending to much time on the web. Youre losing touch with what made you awesome. Maybe some time away from reddit will help return some of your objectivity. Youre going through internet aging where you become a grumpy old man because youve been in the same place for so long. I think its happening to a lot of people. They are just getting rude and think they are right and can forego any discussion as to whether or not they are. It isnt helping people just dividing them. Is building a strawman about OP and then dismissing it fair? Why not just ask him what tree pose is and why he thinks its better than rope? That seems to get the same message across in a much more reasonable way than insinuating he believes in magic and that his belief is wrong.So in short take a break. The constant presence here seems to be taking a toll. Dont become the jaded guy on the web. Be the voice of reason. I respect you a lot.

You can eat all the right foods get fiber all your micronutrients and macronutrients etc. Eat nothing but chicken breast eggs whole grains vegetables fruits and everything else considered to be a healthy food but the fact of the matter is if youre eating  calories a day and expending  youre going to gain weight. Likewise if you eat  and expend  youll lose weight. What you eat determines how much of that gain or loss is fat or muscle but the overall gain or loss is determined by net caloric consumption. Calorie counting is at least equally important as any other factor in a proper diet and more important than most. Its less of an issue on a bulk than it is on a cut but its still pretty important. Luckily as you do it more and more it becomes much easier to guess general calorie content correctly so you dont have to constantly be checking nutrition labels.,martialarts,cj8bemk,22,t5_2qkt4

1590726,0,t1_cjfgahx,Yes she has a strong clinch but trying to avoid it has been the downfall of her opponents.  The problem with trying to capitalize on her striking is that a lot of Rondas striking is geared towards closing the distance to clinch range and its extremely hard for striking alone to stop a clinch.  If you stand your ground youre doing to catch her hanger and get clinched.  If you back up shes still going to come forward and now she has momentum on her side and youve got to worry about running up against the cage.  Backing up also significantly weakens your strikes.  So the third option is to move into the clinch proactively.  Use your own striking and setup your own Muay Thai clinch before Ronda can.  If she meets you in the middle at best you can catch her with a knee as she ducks for the hanger or youll end up in the clinch anyway.  If she backs up then you can open her up with strikes.  Inside the clinch if you have the plum setup you can frame her out and prevent her from getting her hips close for throws.  When she inevitably goes for head control it will give you opening for knees to the body followed up by elbows to the head.  If she tries to break your muay thai clinch then you can push off or giver her an elbow on the way out.,martialarts,cjfojx0,1,t5_2qkt4

Its not something people would mention in a normal class.  Most are embarrassed amp traumatized by the situation.  We dont want to preach selfdefense and safety amp then throw them to the wolves without any context or background.We dont even allow observing for that reason.

When they decided to revive Catch they were essentially adding submissions to a very strong wrestling game. Thats fairly unheard of in Catch with ironically Matt Furey being the other notable Catch guy with an amateur wrestling background.If youre going to learn Catch related stuff you want to train under guys with a Shooto lineage. These guys all also have BJJ but thats fine. Youd learn good stuff from someone like Erik Paulson or Matt Hume the latter being Barnetts original coach and the former someone Barnett has also learned from.

Most Brazilian slavers did not permit cultural practice of any kind from their slaves.

Weightlifting is the clean and jerk and the snatch.All pro fighters do a mix of conditioning that includes cardio resistance training and  mobility work. They tend to focus on their weaknesses. For example Bravo focuses on cardio via swimming before Metamoris because he knew he was pretty strong from lifting but that he needed much more gas in order to compete at a high level again.There are fighters in every art who rely on their strength more than other attributes.

1812875,0,t1_ck7jl3h,I dont feel that I am being combative and if it comes across that way it is certainly not my intent.gt Most of our arts are not allowed in BJJNot allowed?  Every BJJ gym I have ever been to has open mats.  Anyone can go that is how I got involved.  As far as simplicity is concerned remember that Judo Sambo Catch and BJJ have different rule sets with varying allowances and still favor roughly the same submissions.  In those highly competitive settings I submit that if there existed an easier way people would be all over it.  Finally I point out that John Jones and Uriah Hall both suffered severely broken toes in early rounds of competition and continued for  more minutes.  Countless fighters have broken hands and kept in the fight.  In a self defense setting your attacker will be equally keyed up potentially intoxicated and it is likely that they would be able to fight through similar small breaks.   Submissions are not pain compliance.  If the person doesnt tap the become unconscious or the limb is completely destroyed and rendered useless.  The idea being that if they keep on fighting you keep on breaking stuff made that much easier because they only have one working arm.

There might be time for a punch no more.And two you have much more force you are essentially putting your entire bodyweight vs. the strenght in your opponents wrist. Not to mention that you got great leverage. The closer youre to your own body the stronger you are. Hes as far out youre basically keeping it right to your chest. No the problem with wrist locks isnt that the mechanics dont work. They do. The problem with them lies in catching the wrist and starting the motion. If you can catch the wrist get a good grip and initiate the motion your opponent is going down if you got a clue about what youre doing. And once they are down you can lock them without any issue. They are on the ground you got their arm. Theres tons of examples. I am really bad with names of techniques but something as simple as an armbar would be easy to go into. But that is a big if. Not sure if theres any competition recordings of it non that I know. But I mostly watch MMA and the gloves makes it more or less impossible to get a grip anyway.

1931750,0,t1_cklrzmq,Serious Answers You get used to being hit and NOT panicking. Believe it or not most people just panic. I remember the first time I went up against a Golden Gloves boxer. I hit him with the right cross straight to the face. Dude didnt even blink. Totally freaked me out. Didnt know at the time that boxers train to not blinkclose their eyes in case of an incoming attack. I dont know what you mean by cover mechanics but in FMASilat we use Stacking. Great thing about FMA we start with weapons. And most of the knife disarms work against guns.Ive trained with security military police and THEIR instructors. Believe me these guys come up with all sorts of scenarios to prepare against. If you feel like theres a scenario you cant handle then you havent trained enough. I remember at this one training camp they had different types of vehicles to fight in and around. They even had an airplane fuselage. One of the scenarios an instructor came up with was fighting off three terrorists in the airplane cabin section WITH A GODDAMN POOL NOODLE. EDIT Words.,martialarts,cklymqp,2,t5_2qkt4

2096835,0,t1_cl5nvco,Ok I just rewatched the fightquest episode and Im glad you made me do it because I havent seen it in a while and I forgot what it showed. These are my thoughts and my thoughts only  others with more experience may think differently or not. You may want to ask this same question in rKajukenbo too. Its a small slow sub but people will eventually answer you.Here is the video for reference or the lazy haha  Ill say that GreatGrandmaster Gaylord is very respected in the Kajukenbo community as an old school hard style guy and you can be guaranteed that he is the real deal. Master Harper is very well known too but I dont know a lot about him other than at one time he was our systems Professors the creator of Kajukenbo bodyguard. I should learn more.In short I think it showed a very good representation of what Kajukenbo is all about. Most but not all of what they show I have experienced. The only thing that I think was kinda odd was the whole secret underground fight club thing... Im sure that kind of thing happens in their school but not every school and it seems like it was more about sensational good TV than anything.In long I could talk about the specifics for days but Ill just hit some high points....the no rules description is right on. There are no fancy flying kicks or scoring points in the street you defend your lifesafety in the most economical effective and often violent way as possible as fast as possible then you run the hell away to a safe area. Groins are a major target for this kind of thing...its funny how often guys say they want to come to my class but when I say they absolutely must wear a groin cup because you will get kicked in the nuts probably in the first class they look shocked and never show up. This is your life guys not a point competition!  Defending yourself against multiple attackers at  a moments notice is real it happens so you should train for it and be comfortable with it. The guy on the show that was taken to the park did a pretty good job of keeping  attacker between himself and the other attackers. You never want to be in between  attackers. They are right on about the every attack immediately turns into a counterattack a multiple counterattack. You dont want to spar with a bad guy you want to block or slip a kick or punch then immediately flow into a destruction that will allow you to run away. What else....there is so much to say....these things Im saying arent really specific only to Kajukenbo  lots of arts have these thoughts as well or at least they probably started out that way eons ago. Just a couple poor things I noticed. First you may have noticed a lot of women in the club at the end fights. The thing that I like about Kajukenbo is that most every technique is designed to work for all sizes meaning a small woman can protect her life against a huge attacker and Kajukenbo women are downright bad ass so I wish they had shown some women  in the main part of the show. Another negative that I saw that we have been struggling with in our own school is that Kajukenbo has very defined tested techniques that are practiced over and over for muscle memory but a lot of times when fightingsparring the techniques break down to just basic fighting....still effective but where is the knowledge technique? I only saw a few times where I recognized grab art  or advance counter .  This is common to a lot of arts and I think it has a lot to do with Master Harper teaching the guy to not overreact to the first thing the opponent does. We all need to do better with applying the original knowledge and not just reacting wildly. So the last thing Ill mention is that I always get a chuckle out of how intimidating and hard Kajukenbo people look but if you are in the ohana family they are the most pleasant and downright loveable characters. You can see a little of that sprinkled through the show and again some other arts are probably similar but it seems to me to be very prominent in Kajukenbo.So thats my  cents. Hope you enjoyed my really lengthy post. If you have specific questions please feel free to ask here or through private message Ill do my best to answer as best I can.,martialarts,cl6crjv,1,t5_2qkt4

So while I am on board with not being a judgmental twat who shits on everything I also think its important to recognize when a martial art offers no practical value or at the very least it that it fails to offer the qualities that it claims to offer.

2271281,0,t1_cls54l0,umobiusstripinginc is correct in his assessment though Ill go a little more in depth. Your instructor is reading your body to see whats coming but this is almost certaintly because youre telegraphing your movements. Try watching yourself strike and kick in a mirror and watch for small things such as shifts in bodyweight or winding up that could give away your attack. Beyond your involvement in your being countered keep in mind that he knows what you know how to do. Its a lot easier to counter someone when you know what they have to work with and what moves they favor which is his job as your instructor. The distance thing is spot on. The reason he seems so relaxed is because he is.  By being relaxed he uses less energy he can react faster and he can devote more mental energy to watching your movements.  Coincidentally this is likely another reason he counters you so well. If you are tense while fighting its far easier to see an opponents mistakes.  The speed difference is pretty significant too. The waiting for you to attack is a big part.  If you throw a punch or a kick incorrectly you will leave yourself wide open to those who know how to take advantage of the situation. Lastly is experience.  This is most easily broken down to reaction time and pattern recognition.  If youve ever played league of legends its basically the same thing.  Your instructor knows what your and his ranges are and he knows what tools you have at your disposal.  His large amount of experience allows him to examine your attack recognize the pattern it fits and activate the muscle memory that counters it without thinking.  Think about it this way. If you know exactly where and when someone is going to punch or kick and where they will leave themselves vulnerable it wouldnt be that hard to counter would it?  You simply have to get out of the way and wait for them to let you hit them.,martialarts,clsg793,4,t5_2qkt4

2474008,0,t1_cmhbl9m,gt Putting your knee on their chin doesnt affect the triangle in any way.I reread what you said before.  I was referring to actual kneeing but the knee crossface is also fine and I get that you said it was the wrong side.  If theyre straight on to you then yes you should choose the bad perpendicular side to go to then the knee cross face defence works great because youre unscrewing their legs and the triangle is getting larger and its weaker for their legs to press.  However if someone puts their head near my knee on the good perpendicular side I can knee them.  The knee crossface is a nice way to do something illegal in a grappling comp but which is in reality a strike.  You can also put your foot under their chin and step on their neck but that is a nonstriking stomp variant that still isnt legal.gtI was taught to get an angle hook the leg and stomp curl I didnt learn until years later around .Pride was  and onwards though.  Thats  years.  Im not sure how many BJJers there were teaching in Japan at that time they were Shooto and Judo guys.  And as mentioned everyone was always taught to get an angle and squeeze the knees.  This doesnt make other methods of finishing nonexistent.gtIm just not fine with the method that makes it easy as fuck to slam you. Unless its a Jacksonesque slam no one is going to lift you straight up.  As they pull you slowly up then youre clear for a leg hook and getting more perpendicular and thats all you can do except for letting go.  Letting go is preferable then.  Pulling on the head prevents people picking you up easily.  Arona didnt pull on Jacksons head he was faffing around with an armbar.  Until they stand up you cant easily hook a leg.  Once theyre up sure youre close to the leg and you can now hook it.,martialarts,cmhhntw,1,t5_2qkt4

I would say that while its still awesome its not HEMA. If you study techniques that you find on statues vases and so on and combine that with your MA training from other disciplines to make those techniques work. I would say that what you are doing are HEMA.However while its usually dificult enough to understand a technique when you have a picture  describing text  so that you have to be modest about your interpretation.

They dont have to go full force when learning a technique but at some point there should be a stage where the other person is actively preventing that technique from being applied to them.Ask how often they sparroll.  Ask what level of intensity they use when they sparroll.If it is a striking style do they mainly throw their attacks at empty air or into padsbag?  The latter is vastly preferred.Are the instructor and students in decent shape?

2612174,0,t3_2prkhn,If you want to know how to defend yourself in a on fight any grappling sport. FYI Judo is only competed in a way where groundwork is minor  its certainly a huge part of the martial art of Judo. Grappling is practiced at full speed with a lot of sparring and emphasis on highpressure situations like competitions. Its also very easy to throw a dangerous punch if you have no technical prowess but not so easy to defend a trained strangler from dumping you on your head and getting your back.The only martial art Ive seen be very effective against multiple attackers with multiple pieces of evidence is boxingkickboxing. Its quick you dont compromise yourself by going to the ground and so on. The issue is they are trained as sport so the strategy I have seen work of backpedaling and swinging at every chin that comes within reach might be lost in a tough situation.I dont think Krav Maga is as good as they claim it is especially at the level it is trained in America. But whatever. Do what you want. Just try to be very realistic and honest about the techniques you learn because its better to lose your wallet at knifepoint than your life trying to keep your wallet at knifepoint. I also dont think you really need to drill a toekick to the dick. Again Ive never trained in Krav but it seems like guys make it up as they go a lot when I see videos. In the ones where technique looks clean and impressive it also looks choreographed and the uke looks too compliant for me to believe the technique.,martialarts,cmzjqpj,5,t5_2qkt4

2671192,0,t1_cn6sz4x,MMA has ended the discussion of grappling styles. Jiujiteiros wrestlers judoka and Sambo practitioners have all been champions and have all own and lost against each other. We understand and respect one another because reality keeps us in check. Every fight has a winner and a loser and when you see your arts representative unconscious on the canvas you are forced to accept that your art is not infallible. We are reminded of our strengths and weaknesses too often to lose perspective.So many TMAs dont have that because theyre typically too deadly for sparring or MMA competition. When I visited a CMA school the instructor scoffed at my years of boxing and proceeded to teach an entire lesson about how boxers could be easily beaten by grabbing our wrists and elbowing our fists into pieces. This of course was far too dangerous to drill live so we pantomimed the motion for the better part of an hour. He and his students disrespected boxing because theyd excused themselves from testing their teachings. In doing so they lost their perspective and abandoned themselves to useless endeavors.

And its very fucking difficult to do with a mouthguard in place.Outside the ring?Drop a few preconceptions for a moment. Imagine a situation where the trained martial artist is trying to deescalate a situation with a noisy aggressive opponent. The MA doesnt have the option of running away perhaps they have someone with them they need to care for.The MA maintains an open stance and lowkey body language. His voice stays low and reasonable. Unfortunately its not working and the aggressive person launches a classic righthook assault.At this point the MAs voice becomes a valuable weapon. Using it properly and youll find that the breath control of kiai is exactly the same as that of stage actors and singers and others who need to get volume into their voices the MA produces an extremely sudden and piercing yell. The attacker blinks startled. Not stunned. Not injured. Just surprised and offbalanced  like anyone whos just been confronted with a sudden loud noise.Youre posting here. I expect youre trained. If you know exactly when your opponent is going to pause and blink and be open... how many really good shots do you think you can get in?Remember drop the preconceptions. Youre not in a ring facing Anderson Silva or Muhammed Ali. Youre in a bar trying to deal with a slightly drunk and unreasonable man who believes he can overwhelm you with strength through a sudden early strike. Hes not a trained guy or his training is pretty fucking stupid what with him picking fights in bars and for the last two minutes youve kept your voice low and even and kept your body language open and nonconfrontational. Youve given him no warning.Its a tactic you see. Part of a larger strategy. If you put your fists up and circle and warn him that youre going to fight he will prepare himself mentally. So you dont do that. What you do is burst into action without warning  and the violent piercing shout is just one more means of fucking up his sensorium disorienting him long enough for you to take the advantage.

Before TaekwonDo was being developed it was rare to see a flying side kick flying of any type of kick. It was alien and super human back then. Techniques are there for options but to also identify style on what the founders thought would work in a situation. I could make some basic kick punch and block techniques and call it my own. But unfortunately it could be related to many arts. It could be related to a martial art practiced by polar bears in Arctica thousands of years ago for all we know. But in order to have a strong martial art you got over many techniques that makes it its own art so no one will call it KungFu Karate or Polar Bear Rough amp Tumble. Its got to be its own. Thats why TKD techniques are performed differently and even has its own personal techniques from its father Shotokan Karate. Thats why a TKD side kick is performed differently and more painfully technical than other arts thats why a Muay Thai roundhouse is different to Karates and TKDs thats why BJJ is different to Judo etc etc. the forearm rising block was to block a stick about to be hammered on your head. The sitting stance horse stance is just a stable way or practing striking techniques from the upper body basically so you didnt lose balance.

Everyone gets at least a little stuck except for very specific circumstances.I do like the idea of a rushing takedown without spending time on the ground but I think against anyone trained a knee becomes a pretty crappy thing for you to run into.

3029975,0,t1_coc0fz3,gt With high reps like that there is little benefitThats a huge and unsubstantiated leap there.  You have any proof to back it up or are you just basing benefit purely on weightlifting gains?I personally always go for high rep low weight stuff like body weight exercises grappling drills kettlebells sledge hammer workouts or indian clubs.  Ive found them to be very helpful for my grappling swordwork and general functional fitness.  The way I look at it I rarely need to squat over  pounds but its a lot more useful to me to be able to swing my sword or shrimp  times without getting exhausted.As long as you maintain correct form and technique and listen to your body there is negligible risk of repetitive stress injury.  The only people that get injured through high reps are bonehead who try to power through the pain that their body is trying to use to tell them that theyre doing it wrong.  By contrast highweight powerlifting is incredibly stressful to your joints and tendons the rates of muscletendon tearing injuries among competitive weightlifters is quite high.,martialarts,coc1z1m,1,t5_2qkt4

This makes sense to me as amp are the ones boxers line up with and hitting with the others for boxing will break your hand easier. so an inexperienced person would break these more commonly.

Compliance is expected and required because of the legality of the warrant.gt if the person didnt act in a manner causing the officer to feel the need to draw his weapon they wouldnt be shot.The problem lies with things like noknock warrants.  The occupant of the home has every right by law at least in the US to defend themselves their homes and families. However when subjected to a raid they are unaware that they are being raided by the police and prepare to fight off armed intruders as is their right.  The police however are trained to react to threats by shooting for the center mass upon seeing a weapon this lead to the deaths of innocent home owners and flashbangs in cribs.  By resorting to noknock tactics the police have basically eliminated all options except an armed confrontation.  The suspect in this situation is in a nowin situation.  Dont fire and risk being robbed or killed by armed intruders. Fire and face additional charges and police retaliation leading to injury or death.gtIt doesnt happen if you act like a normal person.What happens if the suspect is not normal? Mentally challenged or psychologically impaired individuals might not have the capacity to understand or comply with police instructions.  If they have only committed minor crimes but are unable to comply with police do they deserve to be subjected to force?  This poor man didnt speak english.

In kendo a flatfooted stomp is called fumikomi and its one of the most basic and fundamental part of Kendo footworks but Ive never heard of it explained as developing more power through channeling pressurepowercompressionreactionary force.The power behind a cut in kendo comes from the weight shift forward and downward not the impact of foot landing on the ground. The stomping is just a byproduct of this weight shift compounded with landing flatfooted on springy wood floor. Trying to make your stomp louderstronger by lifting from your knee and slamming down as if to squash a bug is one of the rookie mistakes thats heavily discouraged it could lead to foot and knee problems over time. Though it may feel goodstrong when you stomp loudly I dont think it actually add to your power physically. Additionally kendo cuts has both forward and downward components so even sinking in spot would help because they are along the same direction.

3596375,0,t1_cq26g8n,Within which there are no hooks or uppercuts and frankly not a lot thats useful outside of the straight punch and the hammerfist. The utility of hooks and uppercuts doesnt come from how many knuckles youre striking with or using the edge of the hand versus the knuckles. It has to do with the different angles of attack they provide and their varied mechanics allowing them to be chained together rapidly and surprise the opponent.Hammerfists also arent really useful the way theyre trained theyre useful on the ground as part of a ground and pound strategy.... Youre using a Kwonkicker tutorial to make the point that TKD has boxingesque handwork buried in it when Kwonkicker only developed that handwork by training with kickboxers and nak muays? Really? Once upon a time Kwonkicker was pure TKD. Today even he admits that his style is a fusion of TKD and various kickboxing forms.Hes taken that so far hes actually based the character he plays in his whole Slug Street Scrappers spiel on that idea and yes using footage of himself from his tutorial videos to make the point that hes fusing multiple arts together.Joe Rogan is a better example of pure TKD he was an Olympiclevel competitor who floundered as soon as he transitioned to kickboxing. He soon abandoned striking altogether in favor of grappling and when he demonstrates striking remains solely in his TKD milieu.When you train with Muay Thai practitioners at their camp and train their drills which Kwonkicker did because they were preparing him for his fight youre training Muay Thai. Sparring is different. Thats about expression to a point and the fact that youd compare sparring a karateka to training with a Muay Thai camp which entails far more than just sparring specifically with the intention of getting ready for a fight under an unfamiliar ruleset smacks of false equivalency.And pit chagi still involves a pivot an opening of the hips and a chambersnap of the leg. None of those are at all present in Kwonkickers low kick which uses the baseball bat methodology of Muay Thai.,martialarts,cq27oxe,2,t5_2qkt4
3612196,0,t3_31phwa,There are plenty of bad TKD schools dont out there dont get me wrong. Probably far more than decent ones sadly. But there are plenty of TKD posts right now because thats the way conversation trends online. Topics get spoken about a bit then later on people talk about something else. A few months ago there were quite a few posts about judo next there were a good few posts about wing chun. Now TKD is being talked about more often than other arts and in a few months there will be another conversation we are talking about often. There are a few guys here who have switched from TKD to Muay Thai but are able to use their TKD kicks in Muay Thai sparring. This kinda shows that the techniques in TKD are often not the problem but the delivery systemtraining methods leave something to be desired for the most part.I am not a TKD guy I have no dog in this fight and I think if you walk into the average TKD dojo wanting to learn how to fight you will probably be disappointed. But if you find the rare place that spars like a kickboxing gym or you already train another striking art like Muay Thai or kickboxing you can develop decent kicking game from TKD.,martialarts,cq40lsl,5,t5_2qkt4

It did for me at least.  Pretty much raise the roof in front of you with your arms stretched up and then allow your arms to drop down until theyre about  degrees bent.  You should be able to see both of your hands in front of you.Our sensei likes to say Watch the movie.  Dont be in it.  That is let your hands frame your vision.

We also condition our legs to an extent where you can lean into the kick although I much prefer checking.I think when done correctly Kata is amazingly good. However in a lot of Dojos hell even in my association its done badly. People going through the motions. Kata should be practised like you are almost shadow boxing an invisible opponent. Every movement is triggered towards the assailant.The thing that makes kata so important is the bunkai if your unaware Bunkai is the adding of another person to do the attacking side as the kata is normally the defence. After the Bunkai is learnt then you start increasing the tempo basically creating high intensity with about  intent. After this stage at the end of the sections you can start to add your own thing ei. If there is a takedown you can add a sweep or leg lock.It basically becomes half arranged then half free.  Which hopefully then increases the free fighting of the Karateka adding techniques more than just a jab cross and round house kick.,martialarts,cqempvo,1,t5_2qkt4

Part of the issue from my very limited understanding of HEMA is that practice of them evolved or was discontinued in such a way that their eventual revivals? have had to be largely archeological projects. The nature of that meant that people had to turn to the only artifacts that were available  books.If directline transmission of Asian Martial Arts had fallen apart I think wed have a lot more discussion about the various training texts that were developed for transmission from the actual books and scrolls of techniques to the discussion of the various training poems that many arts used to share ideas. ,martialarts,cqz83rg,5,t5_2qkt4

3921666,0,t3_35cxn8,Where are you located? Maybe we can suggest something in your area. Do not fall for martial arts that claim they are too deadly to spar. This usually but not always means avoid Krav Maga or any of a variety of be hybrid pseudomilitaristic arts that claim to teach fighting skills without actually ever doing any fighting. Martial arts proficiency is a long road and actual ability takes time to achieve. Id suggest you start in a sport based system that has an active culture of competition and actual fighting. Boxing Muay thai bjj judo wrestling are all good places to start. Id recommend bjj for a smlish guy or judo. Start there. Both arts are great at nullifying the advantages size gives an opponent. Krav is an option to check out a lot of popular krav and rbsd systems advocate cheap shots groin throat eyes ect. Its not a bad option in a pinch but if you cant throw a decent jab cross dont expect to explode eyes and throats. Do yourself a favor and check out judo or bjj. If youre incredibly thick headed try FMA KaliArnisEskrima  Ive done it quite a while FMA focuses on weapons but theres a strong contingent of FMA pseudocommandos that never entered the military but want to play soldier without actually fighting anyone.

4465471,0,t1_csthrih,First of all you quite clearly are unable to support the claim you made about my argument.gt My argument never came close to aikido sucks because I said soAlways strawmen with you.  What did I just say your argument was?Aikido sucks against one therefore Ive proven it cant work against twoShould we quote you asserting the argument?Specifically in the context of Aikido. If you cant do well against one opponent you are not suddenly going to do great against multiple. If you cant get your wrist lock throw or take down to work against a single guy you are not going to be more likley to pull it off when he is with his friends. if you cant use your skills or techniques effectively against one guy how are you going to do so against multiple? . If something doesnt work against a single attacker it isnt going to work against multiple. Now maybe Aikido works better against three people than say Judo does. But you still need to be able to use your stuff against a single person before you are going to have any chance against more than one. if you cannot effectively use that avoidance against a single person it wont work against multiple. You are saying that something that you cannot effectively use against one guy can suddenly become effective against multiple?. it has to work against one to work against two. if you cant use it against one you cant use it against multiple. If you cant use your stuff effectively at all against one guy it doesnt suddenly become more effective against two.. to use that against multiple you still have to effect a single opponent. You want to throw a guy or trip a guy into someone you still need to trip that single guy. If that throw or trip doesnt work against the single guy you can throw him into another to begin with. Not all arts are effective. You have to establish its effectiveness against a single person before you can make a claim about its effectiveness against multiple. I think some Aikido stuff works but not all of it and the training methods involved are usually poor .. something has to work against one person to work against multipleThats  times in one thread you entirely dismissed Aikido based on your suggestion that it didnt work against a single attacker in the very specific context of the multiple attacker scenario and how BJJ and most pure grappling have issue with it.  Every time I pointed out the fallacy too but you repeated it again and again and again.  If its not specifically about Aikido then its equally as problematic for every martial art and makes comparison impossible.  You might as well say if your kickpunchchoke doesnt work against one guy .. if youre going to say if your avoidancewristlockthrow doesnt work ...  Its only involved because youre suggesting Aikido doesnt work against one and thus cant work against multiple.  Whats even crazier is that this simply your redirecting the argument away from the multiple attacker problem.gt The argument was never about aikdio it was about something needing to work against single person before working against multiple whatever that something might beYou mention Aikido over and over as Ive just proven.  It was in the context of Aikido potentially being better than BJJ for multiple attackers.  It was in a thread about Aikido.gt The fact you still dont understand that is the reason I stopped bothering to discuss with you.You stopped discussing because you were wrong.  Theres no linear scaling of how effective a martial art is per attacker.  You contend most of Aikido is useless.  The entire point is that its still better than some things in some contexts.gt Yea your posts are there for all to see and anyone who wishes can look through your arguments and see that you consider you saying so being proof.My posts stand pretty well and Ive quoted your intransigence and repetition.gt Also the fact you claim yourself victor and tell anyone who will listen that you wrecked anyone who disagreed with youNo.  I told you that I wrecked you which I did.  Theres not a single facet of the argument that I didnt address substantively and leave you without counter.  It serves no purpose to patronize and pretend thats not the case.  You made a number of rationalized excuses as you left too and ducked nearly every single point.gt is hilarious when what actually happened is they got bored of playing chess with a pigeon.I demonstrated this exact bluster multiple times in the thread.  This seems to be your thing patronization and faux arrogance.  This suggestion of yours is patently ridiculous.  Whether or not you agree with me Im quite clearly informed and making solid argument.  You in no way established any sort of intellectual superiority and nobody believes that.  As I said bluster.gt I however wont bother going back through that againThat is to say you cant support your assertion.  It took me a few minutes to dig that up.  Its a single thread with not all that much to follow.gt It was a waste the first time and would be more so the secondWhats a waste of time are your excuses.  You were not able to properly assert an argument the first time and your recourse is apparently to make up a bunch of nonsense in unrelated threads several weeks later to make yourself feel better.

4479711,0,t1_csubxco,Excellent questions...I was very much a kid at the time this is roughly  years ago.  I am a very different fighter now most of my choices and refinements are based on what I learned bouncing and fighting skinheads.  My best answers follow    . At the time my school was a bunch of  year old kids with one Puerto Rican friend who had a black belt in kung fu and a garage we could train in.  We had learned what we were up against skinheads and what their tactics were so we did train a lot in multiple attacker and escape scenarios.  We probably ran more than we did techniques.  We ran a lot.   . Early on I was very loose and I tried to fight from an emotional place.  That will get you killed.  I became a very analytical fighter and still am.    . Im a defensivecountering fighter by nature Muay Thai and Eskrima are my current mother arts but against groups of  skins I had to take risks I normally wouldnt and take more of the initiative.  You cant be static even  v .  . Mostly I stayed on my feet because once you lose mobility you are as they say going to have a bad time.  . The form of Southern Tiger I diddo has similarities to judo and ju jitsu and I had briefly been a wrestler as well so I would say I was moderately experienced with grappling.  . Skinheads had no interest in learning to fight I rarely saw anything but rudimentary grappling and clinches.  . Absolutely.  If going to ground against multiple opponents is bad then the reverse corollary is also true...if you are in a group have someone who can bind clinch or hold so everyone else can come to bear.  In Put Em Down Take Em Out they talk about having a choreographed attack with a fall guy....that kind of thing would work perfectly coming from the other side.    Thank you for the questions.

A striker has to get fairly lucky and land something that puts a grappler out of commission or else throw constant delaying strikes most knockout techniques are going to if they dont succeed give the grappler the opening they need for the takedown.Grappling meanwhile is an art where once youre in their range unless you have some idea of what theyre doing youre pretty screwed.Even someone with zero experience knows how a punch works.

However what it does is limited in scope it does one thing very well.Im sure you could expand it into something more encompassing but right now there are areas that it doesnt touch on such if there are weapons involved or multiple attackers or if you need to disengage or relocate.In my experience at having been on the receiving end Judo is very good at dealing with one threat in one spot. Where Krav Maga is better and I put that in quotations intentionally because it is not better it is different is in providing a foundation to as many situations as a person can feasibly encounter in environments with less controls than you see in a Judo Randori.  Statistically having  effectiveness in  of situations is better than having  effectiveness in  of situations.  Im just pulling those numbers out of my ass.Thats just my uneducated opinion.

4966663,0,t3_3ivptv,Here goes my POV.The purple guy is both an asshole for sucker kicking the other guy and also extremely stupid by not having neither the courage nor the technical proficiency to finish what he started.The purple guy shows some degree of proficiency kicking both with a full roundhouse kick and some round kicks to the body.At all times he keeps his hands dangerously low which leads me to think he has little or none experience using them and that may point to TKD or other similarly kickingfocused style.He also tries to goat the other guy by exposing his face which his opponent wisely doesnt fall for and he stupidly puts all of his weight on his front leg on a couple of ocasions which is a big NO except in some styles wrestling and perhaps boxing if youre a slugger with an iron chin and even then...you shouldnt be doing it.His opponents unfamiliarity with his techniques allows him to keep the initiative for most of the video but he doesnt make anything of it since his kicks neither hurt nor stop the adversary and his hands seem to be there just for show.The lack of strength in his kicks and his complete striking ignorance also leads me to think he trained in pointsparring which can be complicated to adapt to a fullcontact situation either in sports martial arts or street fighting.Finally his lack of comittment catches up with him and from a leg grab he attempts some sort of standing takedown for which he doesnt have neither the technique nor the weight to pulloff appropiately and from there he gets taken down and beaten in th ground.So hes an imbecile on several levels and also a shitty fullcontact martial artist. The other guy wisely keeps his distance breaks attemps to grab his hands and finally uses a window of opportunity when it presents itself to finish things quickly and brutally.In this case common sense timing and patience thwart stupidity.,martialarts,cukl3v6,4,t5_2qkt4

Having a psychological advantagethe element of surprise knowing your enemyis an enormous advantage. Learn to identify the pressure points and sensitive areas within easy reach. You may not want to reach up to do face strikes but shins ankles and solar plexus are your friends in addition to the nuts  Youll most likely never be facing another martialartist in the wild unless you go looking.

However you have to make sure your approach to bjj is different than to mt.First of all bjj generally has a weak standup game. If you want to learn how to take people down effectively learn wrestling or judo. Or you might be lucky and have a gym that teaches one of these arts as an alternative to bjjs standup game like me. Be careful youre not drilling shitty techniques.That said bjj is lethal on the ground. Mt is far from techniquedriven. It is more about intensity cardio and footwork. However bjj is far more of a mental workoutyou must be aware of your body at all times. It requires constantly feeling where your balance is. More importantly if you are rollingbjj sparring and pushing constantly you are missing the entire point if bjj which is to be like water. Feel your opponent and move with them never fully resisting them. There should be no moment when you are overpowering someone with your physical strength.My suggestion would be to avoid using strength at all for the next few class. Focus on the feel of it. Redirect your opponents energy and explore counterintuitive creative solutions to situations that you would normally just force. Drill techniques with slight resistance and learn how to use that resistance instead if overpowering it. And definitely work on that muay thai clinch! ,martialarts,cvho1ia,3,t5_2qkt4

5456921,0,t3_3pt05e,My usual recommendation to those who want to achieve the technical objectives of aikido nonviolent elegant and mechanically efficient selfdefense by means of locks throws and pins is that they should study judo. Judo frequently doesnt look as elegant and efficient as aikido in practice but this is due in large part to the fact that judoka spend a great deal of their training time in randori a form of practice in which they earnestly attempt to throw the other fellow while not getting thrown themselves. Aikidoka spent most of their training time in oneonone cooperative technique practice with one fellow attempting to throw the other and the other providing only enough resistance to ensure that the technique is being performed properly if that. The first kind of practice inevitably looks a lot messier than the second so people get the idea that aikido is a lot more elegant than judo but when aikidoka engage in the first kind of practice it looks more chaotic and messy and when judoka engage in the second kind of practice it looks elegant and efficient.Both arts pursue nonviolent selfdefense through elegant efficient movements one just tends to do so in a manner thats a lot more functional than the other.,martialarts,cw968x9,11,t5_2qkt4

5573666,0,t3_3rguq1,Theres a lot going wrong in his arguments but Ill focus on the big pieces.The rules he thinks favor grapplers in fact do not. His point at  for instance is a classic inversion of heads I win tails you lose hes saying that rules prohibiting strikes favor the grappler but rules prohibiting grappling holds...favor the grappler? The illogic here should be immediately obvious. Wrestlers and other grapplers would be better able to capitalize on the hypothetical legalization of foul holds like hairpulling and fishooking. His belief that game players like BJJ athletes would be the ones getting their fingers broken if small joint manipulations were legalized is so so so wrong. He would know this if he tested his theories against a resisting trained opponentsay a purple belt in BJJ or a successful collegiate wrestler under rules allowing small joint manipulation. Hint grapplers have experienced people trying to illegally grab their fingers.Only a groundfighter can force his opponent into a corner . This is wrong for many reasons the most convincing of which is that moving someone against the cage and hitting them is very very effective in MMA even without a corner. Jack Slack talks about this a lot in his fight analyses.He suggests that since MMA fighters sometimes punch with a vertical fist that Wing Chun punching techniques and training methods are validated. But just because some punches land vertical doesnt mean that anything else about WC punching technique or training is valid.He makes a lot of unsupported assertions that come across as grasping at straws. For instance at  he says its hard to stand up by using a flexible fence as opposed to a solid wall. How then do fighters consistently use the fence to stand up? Is this really a substantial problem? Has he ever actually sparred in a fenced cage and found this to be a problem compared to his sparring in a room with walls?He argues that gloves protect the recipients of strikes. This is just not true one can punch so so much harder wearing a glove than without. His proof avoids this problem by being based on data from hitting a punching bag which is soft. Also he egregiously misuses the term statistical significance.His example of fighting in a supposedly favorabletostriking environment small enclosed space with a hard floor and gear to protect against chokes and joint locks the lattermost of which is not feasible actually strikes me as a perfect setup for clinch specialists not strikers. Wallgrinders like Randy Couture would dominate in an enclosed space where strikers cant disengage. Throwers like Ronda Rousey would dominate on hard floors where getting taken down hurts more.But overall his entire project of trying to prove that strikers have a hard time in MMA because of rules and gloves and flooring is undermined by the drastic success of striking in modern MMA. Most fights are contested on the feet. Most competitors in the modern era particularly at the elite level rely less on grappling than striking Anderson Silva GSP Jon Jones Mighty Mouse Jose Aldo Conor McGregor Alexander Gustafson...the list goes on. Even wrestlers like Daniel Cormier frequently use their wrestling solely to buttress their striking.,martialarts,cwnyqq2,60,t5_2qkt4

5587560,0,t3_3rmf3m,The idea of a black belt is completely arbitrary and mean nothing other than a way for instructors to group material.Example When I was  I started training Kenpo  trained  years and never got my black belt but was right on the cusp  it had very strict requirements.  I also trained bjj aroud the same time for about  years got my blue belt and was working toward purple when I got injured badly   not related and stopped. I feel like those  years helped me grow as a fighter more than the  before. At  I took wing chun for a . years and got my black belt  or sash as they referred to it.   They didnt hand it to me I earned it but my previous skills really lent it to me to picking up things fast.  At  I moved and didnt like the wing chun schools so I joined a northern kung fu school near my current home.  Been there  years and We use belt systems similar to a japaneese style  Im approaching th degree black belt.  First degree took roughly  years.  What we consider mastery is th degree which takes about  years everything else is grouping together of material to help facilitate effective study of the art.  None of these schools were either overly critical of time or trying to just push people through the system for money.  I trained and advanced at the level and speed that I was able to no faster or slower.  Take stock and see where your concern lies.  Were all athletes trying to attain an unattainable perfection and hopefully growing physically mentally and spiritually along the way. Also something we tell our students that as they approach brown belt they typically bring up  I see a lot of black belts that arent fighters or I feel like I could beat them pretty easily  We run a school not a club  and as such we welcome all levels ages and sex to join and train to better themselves. Some of our students are in their late s when they start and some have been training since they were  and now in their s or even s.  I love what I do and want to share it with as many people as I can and would never deny someone training or advancement in order to preserve what for me is some false sense of attribution to the color of my belt.  If you have a mastery of the material  or close to it and are ready to take something on that IMO is enough for advancement.Food for thought...happy travels!,martialarts,cwpot60,1,t5_2qkt4

This usually comes with multiple smaller hyperextensions of the knee and is commonly seen in football soccer players where they kick full power with little resistance the ball. You can try having more resistance when you kick full power with a bag or pads. Lessen your power when you have no resistance and strengthen your hamstrings so they can better support the powerful knee extension.The much hyped and researched Nordic hamstring curl has proven usefull in preventing hamstring injuries in football and is quite easy to do. Youve gotten a lot of good advice here but I thought this was worth mentioning  do keep in mind that I am taking guesses off of a very brief post in general medical advide is best left to professionals who can do an examination.EDIT Words are hard.,martialarts,cxa243c,2,t5_2qkt4

I dont think that it is just my interpretation.I think it is mate I also think it doesnt need to be brought up in every response if thats how you feel then so be it I dont care to change your mind on the matter but I am aware so we can let it go now gt I do not know many arts  that contain techniques that are proven not to workNot to bash TMA because I am an instructor of several but karate is one of those that you speak of plenty of techniques taught in karate are not applicable in a fight situation especially in this day and age.|I may have not fully explained this either to be fair which is why we are talking solely about technique validity.  The idea of what works and what doesnt is actually more than just about techniques it is about application which is where so many techniques fall short.  For example blocking a knife is going to give the attacker a reference point or zero energy point with which they can redirect their attack along a different line in application this does not work yet it is something that is still taught in karate schools to this day the downward ice pick thrust is defended with a horizontal forearm block.  The other end of this spectrum is the effectiveness of each art in the totality of fighting i.e their weaknesses in certain areas.  Boxing is very good in punching range but very ineffective at kicking range.  Filipino Martial Arts are very effective in trapping range and punching range but are ineffective at kicking range without a stick.  Savate is effective at kicking range but not within close range.  These arts have strengths in certain ranges where their techniques are effective and weaknesses in ranges where they have weak or no techniques at all this is why we absorb what is useful because each art does have usefulness but is not a total answer.  The other end of this spectrum is finding the most effective tools for the job from each art a muay thai round house is considered the most effective kick while the tae kwon do kick is considered the fastest.  It is up to us to choose which works best and disregard those that dont the leg work has been taken out here because many JKD instructors teach the most effective techniques only.gt it works regardless of whether or not it fits in the JKD principlesOf course but that was not the point I was making.  If you can throw a lightning fast kick that can land on your opponents head wed both say that technique works right?  It connects its got the speed required to land before it is blocked or deflected ticks all the standard boxes.  Yet if you perform that technique it lands but the person is still standing and quite aware of the situation as the kick had little to no effect on him would you say that technique worked then?  This my friend is why the JKD concepts are so central because in the scenario  just stated that person will not take kindly to being kicked in the head and will probably want to hit you back...hard and if you have just given him your best shot with a technique that you thought worked because you trained it for  years in your TKD classes and it was praised by the most senior ranked instructor in the entire world who gave you your th dan Black Belt ranking then whats that going to do for your morale when he decides to come looking for vengeance?gt Practicing an art in its intended state allows you to develop it to a higher levelI would never disagree with this in fact its the kind of statement that does not need to be said.  As for the basis for stating it everything you said before it the subtleties are never overlooked when being taught in a different curriculum if they are then that curriculum should be avoided entirely.  When I learned Muay Thai as part of JKD and later when I became an instructor I went through the same processes as those that first learn the art rocking stance emulate kicks without throwing etc for months before I even started to throw kicks regularly and as a result I achieved a high level in this art as it was intended to be taught.  Something that you have obviously not been taught which is at the higher levels of JKD is that the idea of being formless extends to this that we are talking about.  We are not taught to return to stance or start in any particular stance like it is an absolute necessity...strike from where you are is the overriding concept here and that is where the subtleties that you speak of are irrelevant.  I use muay thai as an example here because it is taught in a very specific way with their stance and especially foot position being heavily dependent on your intention.  You cannot possibly hope to emulate this in its entirety in a street fight situation nor can you emulate this in an MMA environment because those that are predictable are usually beaten very easily Ronda Rousey in UFC straight up proves this.  You must learn to adapt be formless these techniques for the situation at hand and in a street situation the subtleties you speak of are irrelevant it comes down to what you can do and how well you can do it from where you are at the given time that is what JKD emphasizes even at the lower levels but especially at the highest level.gt but isnt the way to do that to emulate the process chosen by those who you consider good?To emulate is to imitate and imitation is one of the things Bruce himself said to avoid especially in martial arts so I have to disagree partly.  You dont need to go through the same process to get the best outcome I only know this because many of Dan Inosantos instructors did this.  While they learned JKD off Dan they did not go and explore every single art that he and Bruce did they expanded and explored new arts that had not yet been taught to them Filipino Martial Arts are an example as this was something that Dan researched and brought to the table along with BJJ in recent years.  Another example is with Larry Hartsell who brought several wrestling systems into the fold before his death he was the one responsible for the introduction of many of these techniques into law enforcement similarly Dan was responsible for many arnis and eskrima techniques being introduced into law enforcement.|I dont think you are wrong at all even though it may seem that I am denouncing your entire view on this.  What I am trying to say is that there is no one way to achieve the best outcome in JKD if people decide to do what Bruce and Dan did and learn each art individually without the guidance of their principles most would fail to achieve anything remotely close to what they did because it was Bruces dedication and also his mind that enabled him to see through the dogmatic traditions of martial arts and look at everything in regards to combat reality.  ,martialarts,cxqyk9u,1,t5_2qkt4

Theres no evidence at all that it exists.We can examine the body now with fantastic detail and in real time.  MRI scanning can image literally everything in the body and various other imaging techniques can even watch the brain at work processing information.Scientists and physicians have taken apart millions of bodies both living and dead.... And no one has ever seen any of the structures associated with chi.No meridians or nodes or anything else.We can say categorically that all the demonstration techniques are little more than sideshow stunts.Someone referenced the spear in the throat thing.   Looks great doesnt it..... But that long flexible spear is simply placed in the hollow of the throat and the operator applies pressure not straight forward but down.....

6732050,0,t1_d0fh16d,You might be bulking a bit too quickly. There is a limit on how much muscle mass you can gain in a certain amount of time and for a a tall nonmuscular guy that limit should be about  pounds a month. In addition to that to efficiently gain muscle you should expect to gain one pound of fat for every pound of muscle so about lbsmonth in total. To synthesize a pound of fat your body needs  kcal. For a pound of muscle  kcal. So in your case that makes  kcal kcal a month for the surplus you should be shooting for. That works out to about  kcal extra every day which is about one extra meal depending on how you eat.Of course it is up to you to decide if not having to count your calories is worth the extra fat gain to you or if you maybe even think that any weight gain would be beneficial to you at this point fat or muscle. In BJJ I imagine extra weight can be helpful at times even if its from fat but fat is not going to increase your strength.I base my calculations on the information in this guide I have been following it for a while and am getting good results.,martialarts,d0fnim9,0,t5_2qkt4

Or in TKD we do roundhouse to the hogo chest protector training.  Since the abs are a common area to be struck.But practitioners of iron shirt kung fu take it to the next level all over their body.  They routinely shoulder strike walls and back strike hard surfaces.  Ive even heard of old school kung fu type rub course sea salt on their skin to thicken it.Theres all types of iron conditioning for fist forearm shin foot and fingers.  They all use progressive training to increase the toughness of the part of the body.  Damage is relative.  Some of the changes such as enlarge knuckles fused bones in hands and feet are irreversible.

Did anyone say stop using the heavy bag? No. No one did. Training requires all three phases. Introduction Isolation Integration. Heavy bag work is part of all three phases but you cant stop there.gt and really what is needed is a countering opponent.Now youre just making up dumb shit.

The martial arts that hatsumi teaches is a combat form titled bujinkan budo taijutsu basically an art he learned but gave that title when his grandmaster died and he opened it to the western world fit training. Its not your traditional fighting style. Despite what students widely believe the entire art is a derivative of samurai warfare...dont agree with me? Listen to one of Hatsumis top students Rob Renner. Hell tell you that tale. Antony Cummins is a student of the academic side of ninjutsu who argues that ninjutsu was never a fighting style and that all the written historical evidence points to the fact that ninjutsu in and of itself was just a study in espionage arson and spying.

Theres also Irish stickfighting of course which I understand people are trying to reconstruct but so far I havent seen anything that struck me as particularly convincing and it seems like they have a long way to go yet.

Some of the throws will be useful too but for your work you probably wont want to smash people into the ground full whack however if you can dominate grip and control their decent to the ground you can then use your knowledge of judo pins to control them until they calm down or help arrives.As a doorman i used similar concepts to remove many violent unwanted personnel from our club without ever having to strike anyone.,martialarts,d2mnck4,6,t5_2qkt4

You judge JKD based on what youve seen with whoever you trained with that has done it and have said yourself that many people do not approach JKD in the way Bruce wanted.  You are talking about the art as a whole based on the few people that youve seen who apparently dont do this...do you even know what Bruces direction was with JKD at the time of this death?  If you did youd probably respect more people in JKD than not and that would be largely due to the fact that youd properly understand it.Instead you like everyone else who jumps on the Bruce Lee sucks bandwagon are doing exactly this and hence why in this case your lack of knowledge and experience has formed an opinion that is inaccurate...while you print it in ink on the internet.gt I box and train FMA the empty hand Ive seen from jkd guys isnt particularly good same for the stick and blade work Ive seen.This is exactly the point I am trying to make.  What Ive seen does not make your opinion on the matter informed it makes it biased to external factors not your own understanding.  You look at the individuals in your experience and judge the art based on that same as you would do with karate or tae kwon do or most other traditional arts.  This is WRONG!  The art is not defined by the individual it is defined by the idea the individual applies the idea and that is a measure of their ability not the validity of the art.  The idea today is as strong as it was the day Bruce Lee died whether you have seen enough bad practitioners or not to deem it shit that is the very simple truth that you have ignored and I have tried to get across to you.

7901747,0,t1_d43twna,You pretty much summed up my view. In the early days of ufc TMA became a dirty word in the MMA that represented what is not a good martial art. The use of the term was then abused with twd karate and kung fu schools being instantly dismissed. The  term is incorrect as has been pointed out in other comments that the martial arts like mt bjj or wrestling which were accepted parts of MMA were viewed as modern arts. The funny part  mt and wrestling are older terms even older than words like karate or twd. Even the term kung fu is a modern western one that is used to represent chinese arts but is incorrect.The point is tma is a misused term that has lost any real meaning. Its a stupid term that has been abused to put down other martial arts which have now been shown can be of use in the octagon.,martialarts,d448bp3,1,t5_2qkt4

These techniques will always be low percentage success rate and luck and external factors outside of individual ability play a factor.  A gun disarm on a friend with an airsoft pistol if very different from an attacker whom you dont know placing a weapon in your face. I dont think your anecdote is valid evidence that gun disarms work. Ive trained gun disarms I know that the techniques Ive been shown could potentially work but thats as far as Ill go with it.

The strength of generalist styles like MMA and Sanda arent that they do boxing as well as boxing or that they do kicking as well as Muay Thai. Their strength is that when they come up against a superior boxer they are able to kick their legs out or take them down. Because of that a Sanda practitioner with an equal level of a Boxer or MT practitioner would likely be able to just slam them down repeatedly as their strategy. Seems like a good strategy to me. Similarly a Sanda practitioner on the same level as a MMA practitioner would likely have more practice with standup fighting and takedown defense possibly allowing them to keep the fight standing and winning the striking game. However if the fight did go to the ground the Sanda player would more than likely get choked. This is how it goes.,martialarts,d5jlt7q,2,t5_2qkt4

8479938,0,t1_d60tewn,This is among the most insightful things ive red in this sub for a while. Props to you udarthturtle.One thing i might want to add for the OP it doesnt depend so much on style as on finding a good school that gives you just the right training youre a little bit uncomfortable with. Good training in the martial arts is hard. Its physically demanding. It will hurt sometimes or even most of the times. But that is exactly what makes it so rewarding. And while you will be able to find bullshido schools that do little more than a bit of ballet in strange uniforms in any style i have come to the belief that you can also find good schools in just about any style. Granted some styles will always be more spiritual than others as they emphasize tradition and philosophy more. Say Aikido on the spiritual side vs. Krav Maga on the downtoearth side for an extreme example. But as the poster above me said the real inner work is always done for yourself. If i might point you to a book maybe Meditations on violence by R. Miller is a good read if you want to start reflecting on violence and therefor on yourself.

If you say youre calm Ill take your word for it.You just called me an insecure idiot and assumed my knowledge of Chinese history but thats fine. Ill take your word that its just an act. Problem is there is nothing particularly insightful beyond what you claim was just act. Every time you mention some qigong technique or Daoist principle youre only focused on the mysticism and phenomenon of the act  which is why no one ever takes you seriously. If youre so learned about philosophy then surely you can tell people about why skepticism of observations are warranted and why what you say is plausible. You often speak in riddles as if concealing some greater depth to your comments but you use it liberally mainly as a way to shoot down peoples arguments. There is no depth to what youre saying  youre literally giving a description of Qigong phenomenon and dressing it up in a lot of circuitous adjectives. Dont give me the first line of Dao De Jing either . Theres more to that. What is the purpose of speaking in riddles?The history of my nation is  years with  years of civilization. I dont claim to know even a fraction of it. No doubt youll find gaps in my knowledge everywhere if you tried. But how about this the ignored wise men of Chinese history were not combative actors they went to where people listened left places which were beyond their reach. Even the provocateurs of Chinese history those men who preached to people they knew would not listen  did not fight the fate of their unknowing patients. I admit sometimes the appearance of anger could be a way to motivate certain people. But ultimately teaching methods change people. The proof is in the pudding and yet all you have is a bunch of illrepute on your belt with no achievements to speak of. If Dao is the pursuit of truth one cant help but think youre failing at it.,martialarts,d6j4pjd,2,t5_2qkt4

Thus a perfect technique in the larger sense of a technique in broad terms is one that has the same effect every time.However here I refer to an individuals individual execution of a technique and as this throw accomplished effectively all there is to accomplish in Sumo winning the match with Tori in a safe position and the crowd appreciative I regard this throw as perfect as an entity unto itself.,martialarts,d7wzdzk,3,t5_2qkt4

First IMO theres probably always going to be issues with any competition rules that simulate live combat but for weapons especially there are several problems with modern comps Bladebinding  IMO this is the biggest issue with competitionblades shinai boken nylon trainers is that they dont bind like a sharp blade would.  So when you have a bladeonblade contact you get some maneuver that wouldnt work with real blades. Drawcutting  This is another issue with some competition formats is with drawcutting and scoring them with the eye.  In any format that uses judgesrefs to score you have the issue of scoring them in comparison with other attacks that look more impressive not to mention that its generally hard to judge between a drawcut that scored vs one that just barely missed. Doubleattacks  By this I mean two people either attack nearly simultaneously or one person attacks hits but then is countered quickly by his opponent in the same exchange.  Kendo tends to ignore doubleattacks and simply score the strongest first attack that is technically correct as long as its not a  and Ive seen HEMA rulesets where they score the first attack only if you dont get countered.  Im personally not sure what the best ruleset is.In my ideal dreamworld scenario I would have nylon blades but with either with a sticky blade edge or a grit so that the blades bind properly when clashing.  I would also have competitors wear a fullbody suits and fencingstyle helmets which react to the weapon strikes and along with data from the weapon itself calculate the amount and extent of damage inflicted.  If the damage is deemed to be immediately fatal or disabling the suit will freeze up like the suits in Enders Game or go dark in case a strike to the face to simulate blinding.  If the damage is deemed only partial then only parts of the suit will freeze leading to possible counterstrikes but still leaving you at a disadvantage against a fullyfunctional opponent.  When one or both opponents are rendered dead the exchange ends and points are scored depending on relative damage.  For example a straight kill with no damage is worth one full point and a kill with minor damage is worth a half point.  Mutual kills are worth no points.  The winner of the match is the one that wins best out of  exchanges with sudden overtime coming into effect in case of ties.,martialarts,d8fi3go,3,t5_2qkt4

McGregor vs Aldo Swanson vs Siver and Pearson Trujillo vs Varner Miocic vs Werdum Hall vs Leben Machida vs Bader and Hendo vs Boetsch are all examples of fighters backing up then throwing heavy shots and winning by knockout just off the top of my head. I can also list examples where the countering fighter steps forward to meet the flurry before it begins instead of backing up at all which is what Im actually recommending. The only time you can get away with rushing in with punches like that is against guys who panic under pressure or who are already out of position.

10237675,0,t3_5m2yw7,I know you guys will hate this but when I was  I took TKD and I practiced  hours a day so I could beat up bullies.If someone would mouth off to me after school or in the lunch room Id cold cock him or push him down a small flight of stairs so he was already injured then start working my game. Some techniques worked some didnt. The ones that worked I kept. I basically ended up with one twos and some kicks. All the knife hands and chops crescent kicks got thrown out the window. Nobody knew BJJ back then so it worked pretty well.You cant really do that anymore because there are cameras everywhere and nobody can take a butt kicking without running to a lawyer. Back then it wasnt a big deal probably hard for most of you to imagine....But I learned how to handle aliveness. Thats how it used to be done feel free to read up on Bruce Lee or whatever.

Now striking may not be the most important skill for a small person but it can still be useful. Learning how to avoid being hit is extremely useful regardless of your size.JudoBJJWrestlingOther competitive grappling art  Honestly go with the best teacher is often sound advice. There are a lot of different rule sets and that changes how useful the arts are in different selfdefence situation. I like Judo but proficiency can take a while to build. BJJ is good at again  months of serious training will give you a good advantage against many people. BJJ is also very good in a sofa rape situation where you are sitting with a friend and they wont take no for an answer. BJJs problem is that many schools do not train decent take downs and thats why I like Judo. Judo  BJJ is a very solid combination. If youre not in a rush and everything else is equal Id recommend Judo over BJJ unless the BJJ teacher spends a decent amount of time on taking people down. You may even find a teacher who has black belts in both Judo and BJJ.,martialarts,dc8i3ao,6,t5_2qkt4

10464309,0,t3_5pvr6k,Krav Maga is not really known for giving you a strong foundation for martial arts. In fact many Krav schools even recommend training in other arts to get a good foundation first before going into Krav.In my opinion sport martial arts with a strong tradition of competiton provide you with the best base for martial arts. Id also argue that starting with a limited art is better for a beginner than starting with an art that contains lots of different techniques like Krav Maga.If by Jiu Jitsu you mean Brazilian Jiu Jitsu thats probably a good choice. Traditional Japanese Jiu Jitsu has problems with quality control though and I would not unconditionally recommend it.My recommendation would be to first figure out what martial arts are even available around you and then visiting as many schools as you can for trial lessons to see what interests you the most.

Shotokan is one of the orthodox traditional Okinawan forms of karate so go figure that Tang Soo Do while not identical tends to skew more karateish in its modern form. Shudokan on the other hand was nontraditional and much more open to new development. I dont even think its around anymore and instead has merged with other kinds of karate. It figures that Tae Kwan Do which has evolved significantly away from Japanese karate was initiated by a form of karate that encouraged evolution.,martialarts,ddit0tf,1,t5_2qkt4

Doesnt look like shes.. oh nono she is getting it. Thats exactly why you dont want to have your back flat against the cage.This feels like a coaching session instead of a commentary.However right after at What Reinheimer needs to do is either pull guard or stand upThis gives the viewer something to look out for in the action and youre cheering for her to do either of these things to overcome adversity.The most difficult thing about casting isnt trying to call out every little detail but choosing a narrative and following it.Its a lot more entertaining and creates a story if you filtered out all the small actions and focused on a slightly larger picture.For this fight  Reinhiemer was the more flat footed plodding forward fighter while Joyce was more active but also more evasive.I think everyone really aspires to cast like Joe Rogan but thats a really tall order.tldrStop using I and YousStop talking about yourself and put the spot light on the fighters.Unless this is a study of fight strategy instead of calling fights for entertainmentCasting is hard its a difficult craft that you have to practice for years to get good at.Good work putting yourself out there and trying,martialarts,de6pl0u,5,t5_2qkt4

Boxing BJJ Judo Sambo MMA KickBoxing Muay Thai Wrestling etc. There are other options that arent combat sports but Im trying to make this as simple as possible just in case you dont quite know what youre looking for. The common theme with combat sports and really any martial art worth training for self defense is that they spar. Sparring is crucial. You can learn techniques outside of sparring as a matter of fact thats how most people do it but it isnt the same as getting the inoculation against pain and adrenaline that sparring will give you. You can know as many prerehearsed joint locks combos and counters as you want but if all of it leaves your head when youve been punched in the face of shoved around its useless. Sparring is your opportunity to get punched in the face and thrown around in a controlled environment where theyre not trying to hurt you but theyre still trying to beat you.

Much better to be good at surviving and gainingmaintaining a superior position.As for your confidence jiujitsu is very unnatural and complicated. Its normal to feel hesitant. Try to remember that youre just training and if you try something and it goes wrong it isnt actually going wrong. Its just practice.

11242561,0,t1_df6b8ep,Thats a very difficult one then. Stylistically Silat shares some similarities with traditional Muay Thai but also with Kalaripayattu the former has obviously become popular due to its direct form and functionality whereas the latter with becoming essentially performance art with no martial use in most gyms.Ultimately its more important that a gym teaches you the correct tendencies and mindset for a fight as well as obviously not teaching you any form that with damage your body in use. Silat is a mixed bag as far as I know good practitioners get a lot of mileage out of it and the bad ones are well...bad. I would approach it like Capoeira which Ive studied myself which is research very heavily into what the gym holds as its main focus when studying the art and only join as a demo based on that. If they dont study Silat specifically for the aim of hurting people and defending ones self studying it for cultural connections historical reasons performance etc. and you want a straightforward style it might not be for you. But if they are focusing on its martial uses you can give it a shot just back out if their daytoday classes consist of similar things to the video.

A dope boxer would make short work of gaggles of zombies.Then a bit of judo or sambo to break grips and control clinches hit them with high percentage foot sweeps into stomp kick combos.,martialarts,dfawan2,8,t5_2qkt4
11287390,0,t1_dfbe392,Zombies dont exactly have a death touch but that depends on the zombie. Dont get scratched dont get bit youre probably fine. I would use the Bart Jam Dao more for stabbing and blocking but a slash in the right place can do a lot too. Another really good weapon would be a pair of World War  trench knives.,martialarts,dfbeqxz,1,t5_2qkt4
11290495,0,t1_dfbr5pe,Yeah I dont think breaking the arm of something already dead makes much sense. Although now that Im thinking about it the most useful grappling move would probably be a suplex because their heads are rotting anyway so dump em on their noggins and they go splat bye bye zombie. If the zombie apocalypse ever happens I bet the WWE guys will be the shit.,martialarts,dfbrezl,2,t5_2qkt4
11299346,0,t1_df8zag7,Its a terrible idea to go to a Crossfit gym if the instructor isnt also a certified gymnastics and weightlifting coach. Similarly learning Krav Maga from someone who doesnt have competitive boxing Muay Thai or similar experience is setting yourself up for disappointment. Theyre both physical practices where how good the instruction is depends on what they know outside of whats being marketed. ,martialarts,dfcrij5,2,t5_2qkt4
11313184,0,t1_dfebt1y,Preventative work would be mostly postural.

11361944,0,t1_dfjrc33,Well from what Ive seen of Pak Sau it looks very similar to a parry that is used in boxing and MT. The main differences I see is that the WC version seems to extend the parrying hand further how to hit the opponents forearm while the boxing parry is closer to the body since youre only touching the opponents fix. You can use to enter the clinch by quickly parrying a jab and stepping in to enter with a knee. ,martialarts,dfjusjf,2,t5_2qkt4

11468244,0,t3_63ofde,I dont do yoga but I do lift on the side. I usually wake up at  am and start lifting for  hours. I do this  days out of the week and I separate them by doing back and biceps chest and triceps legs and shoulders on different days. After dinner around  I train martial arts for  hours and usually do  days out of the week. Sometimes it hard to balance but it definitely helps in both sports. My strikes are stronger and I am more flexible for lifting. In the end you just have to find time and push through because doing both weight training and martial arts will sap your energy and strength. But the payoff is definitely worth it if you are passionate about martial arts. This video helped me and I hope it helps you too. ,martialarts,dfvx3u0,1,t5_2qkt4

Nearly everyone is shocked at how difficult it is to put  rounds on target in a tight group with a mm handgun at  yards.  Thats in a controlled environment when youre not stressedshaking and not in danger.  People think things are like the movies where the good guy can shoot a bad guy in the leg at  yards while theyre running away.

11542397,0,t3_64n4ir,Bjj. You learn a bunch of sport chokes and joint locks that are not intuitively broken they arent even on normal self defense curriculums. So once you set it up game over homie. You will control and choke out much stronger people with the slickness. To people who dont train you can pretend to be basically a Ufc fighter.  To people who do you can talk about how in the winter everyone is wearing a gi come here let me show you my street worm guard bro!Krav. You will learn a high level overview of fighting skills and non fighting self defense skills. They will teach you high percentage tactics like sucker punching a belligerent and running away.  To people who dont train you can pretend to be a badass throat ripping killing machine. To people who do train you can be an apologist and talk about how my school spars on Tuesdays for like  minutes bro!,martialarts,dg4bz7q,3,t5_2qkt4
