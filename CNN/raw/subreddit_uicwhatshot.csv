123666,0,t3_1r3mqv,the fun thing about people who know abstract reasoning is that they have no idea how to communicate abstract reasoning to people who cant reason abstractly and thats what this video is literally entirely aboutits stupidrealize how you were as an undergrad and start at literally the most basic assumptions show the wrong paths then show the right pathsif you cant make this leap in assumptions from highly trained gt ignorant then learn how. because that is what being a teacher is.youre a teacher. you are smart they are dumb and you get to pull them up.i am not saying hold idiots hands that dont deserve it  but realize that you need to demonstrate now only how to do work the stuff this videopost is about but that work needs to be done. most of my classmates dont recognize that they need to spend an hour doing rote work outside of class for every hour inclass...if not more. these are smart kids who havent had to work like this. they dont realize abstract reasoning skills are practiced not learned or suddenly granted through an equation  its how to think with equations with the givens...how to think analytically is a combination of teaching the steps of good problem solving and teaching that there are good steps to take.you will never be able to show the work that it takes to get good at something during office hours but you can simply demonstrate how to proceed one hour at a time. you are not going to make someone reason abstractly in one hour but you will over many hourlong periods of demonstration and conversation.so swallow your bitter privilege pill and teach some fuckin abstract reasoning and pray to god theyll do it on their own. and dont post another video like this. you guys have the best job in the world. just take some time to learn who these people are why theyre at UIC and why youre trying to teach them this stuff...they are real awesome folks and that should be your motivation. its an opportunity to have a real impact beyond yourself.,uicwhatshot,cesii7b,1,t5_2rd74
194096,0,t1_cf0elg8,You think CTA buses are unreliable? Try Ann Arbor. My bus is scheduled to come every  minutes then every hour in the evening. A few days ago me and about  others waited for the bus for one and half hours. The next day the bus was  minutes late. Today the bus was  minutes late.Not only that but I hate the traffic light system. One time I waited for a left turn for  minutes because you can only turn when the left signal shows. Except it lasts for only  seconds and there was  semis and other cars in front of me. Each semi took the whole signal to turn. Then of course the intersection only allows traffic going in one direction at a time so it takes forever for the left signal to come back again.I left early that day just so I didnt have to worry about catching the bus at the park and ride. But right when I finally get the turn I see the bus pulling out of the parking lot. So I missed my goddamned bus. I then walked the mile to class through a foot of snow because the traffic light system is fucked to shit. aowienfoawnwaqeorfgjnnpwspoergnhiwou!!!,uicwhatshot,cf0jr1d,3,t5_2rd74

518904,0,t3_1zxswe,Having lived in JST and SRH on west campus both are good options. If you dont mind communal bathrooms and a longer transit SRH is slightly cheaper. JST is probably better locationwise though.,uicwhatshot,cfz94ok,1,t5_2rd74
675168,0,t1_cggzrz6,Having worked at another UIC building Ill just say that theyre not too good at keeping video evidence. The building where I worked at had a robbery in plain day once and when complaints were made management admitted that the cameras didnt work or were just not on. Guess who they tried blaming though? The student workers ,uicwhatshot,cgh0m8r,7,t5_2rd74
2948832,0,t3_2txod5,Oh and money. I have no scholarships here at UIUC and just a small pell and tuition waver. I know dollar for dollar theyre about the same when cost of living is factored in but I should be more competitive for scholarships right? ,uicwhatshot,co3aodw,2,t5_2rd74
2993402,0,t1_co4fvi5,Not sure what the guy who posted before you said but youre right staying at a college you hate IS pretty dumb.  So here are my ramblings and adviceFirst its kinda sad for me to hear that you dont like UIUC and actually kind of surprises me.  Ive visited friends there  times and had a blast each time because its your textbook college town type of college with the sports greek life parties girlsguys and Im totally into that stuff.  That being said maybe you arent into these types of things and maybe you arent one to make friends on your own so switching to UIC might be better for you friendswise and socially.  I know I had my fun at UIC.Second Im late to this post so other people have already said it better than I could with respect to the education and career prospects given your undergrad was at UIC compared to UIUC.  And trying to compare the professors would probably be difficult because I know there are some pretty great profs in the Physics department and I assume there are equally great profs at UIUC so maybe it comes down to research opportunities?  If that is what youre looking into after undergrad.  In fact there is one prof at UIUC that works at CERN or the Large Hadron Collider something like that.  That guy is awesome... Ok on to the rd thing.Third you talked about money and scholarships and stuff.  I have no idea about that because I couldnt really qualify for any so I cant help you there.Overall if I were in your position I would try to break out of my shell and meet some people and have as much fun as a can so maybe you can salvage your time at UIUC and want to stay there.  I definitely had my fun a UIC and I was able to get a job and get into grad school but I would rather eat the debt that I would accumulate at UIUC and get a more valuable degree while trying to meet people and still have fun.  But if you end up going to UIC just know that its a commuter school but it seems  of people are mature and generally nice people.  Youll enjoy UIC if you dont like UIUC because maybe it will be a good change of pace for you.Im not going to proof read this because Im lazy so hopefully it makes sense and helps ,uicwhatshot,co89io7,0,t5_2rd74
3308989,0,t1_cp5fwpe, Youll get an award letter from UIC for your FAFSA the closer you get to Fall. In it youll find how much Grants you get free money and how much loans you can take. My experience with that is if you had paid lunch during high school then youll get some to no money. If you are reduced or free then youll get alot. Did you get the UIC Connect thing yet on the UIC portal my.uic? Read into all those stuff they are helpful. All the friends I have from the college of design seem to have it easy and stress free. But they occasionally have large projects. To me it seems like its much easier in the college of design. Parking is  a year. Tuition means yearly. You have to pay for the UPass if youre full time. You cant op out. If you have health and dental insurance already then op out of Campus Care. Its UICs version of health and dental insurance. Youll learn about it during orientation and they will tell you how you can op out if you want.Side note The only mod active for the subreddit is zitterbewegung.,uicwhatshot,cp5ga7d,1,t5_2rd74
4596332,0,t3_3dncl0,I have a friend who just graduated. Getting in isnt a problem but keeping up with the high level courses will be. Get ready for plenty of allnighters and extremely difficult classes and know that networking will get you a better job than just good grades. My friend is now working for AECOM right out of college with a k salary so she knows her shit. Good luck.,uicwhatshot,ct9yj45,3,t5_2rd74
