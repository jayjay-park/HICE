3415488,0,t3_2zbuem,I dont like the production except for the lead and voice.The bass drum is weak as shit. Take Hit the Lights and play it back to back with any AJFA song on a good stereo. The difference is very obvious. Also Lars put nickels or washers on the drum and it blows out the bass creating distortion that even an isobaric enclosure rumbles out. The compression just makes it worse.Hetfields guitar is too electronic and too scooped. Its not very noticeable unless youre a guitarist and if you get an isolated track it really stands out. KEAs higher top end sound is much better. The guitar does give it a deeper darker tone however when I play the rhythm with a KEAMOP hybrid tone the light boost on the highend brings out a better crunch.The lack of bass guitar. Not that I noticed for years since they laid guitars over each other and that was what I was focusing on. I found those GH master tracks and I assembled them and cut the bass way down it was so overpowered and the songs sound so much better with it.Im just disappointed in the production quality not hating on it.

The last time they actually toured the U.S. Was SIX ! years ago.   If they toured a smaller stage show with dollar max tickets theyd sell out every show and probably make a KILLING on merch.  And thats another thing.  They should do like Maiden does and sell nice newly printed classicdesign shirts and mix in a good  new tour designs by artists like Pushead John Baizely Richie Beckett James Stokoe and whoever comes up with designs for Mastodons merch because their shit is awesome.  ,Metallica,crsbm5b,4,t5_2qwwr

I see where you are coming from in saying its not exactly thrash although there are some very fast songs on that album such as Dyers Eve and Blackened. MoP is hands down a masterpiece but like you said not as thrashy as KEA or RtL. That being said Battery Master of Puppets and Damage inc are also very fast yet technical songs. Im no expert on what is considered thrash metal but both of these albums still in my opinion retain the the elements of a thrash album. ,Metallica,cs46ak1,21,t5_2qwwr

4302642,0,t3_39ev63,I think the problem with any band that changes their sound is the reason why they did it.I really like the fact that many bands overly change their sound but I like subtle nuances too. AJFA was..and is to me..a barrage of riffing that not many peple felt to be enjoyable. Of course Metallica had to change their plan and work on it. While I think a complete change looks etc. was not really necessary they felt it was and only they truly know why.What I am trying to say is that I dont care if its sellout or not less I can understand who stop liking a band just for that reason.

The lyrics on both of those albums feel like an afterthought. DMs lyrics are pretty generic and bland but SAs is laughingly bad. I just dont understand how they didnt take a step back on both and realize how terrible they were. Honestly I cant really stand either album musically either. We all know why with SA but with DM I find it horribly bland. I hate most of the riffs and the vocals are atrocious. The solos are decent but thats about as much praise as I can give it.Hopefully they put some effort into the new album. One can only hope.,Metallica,d1326mq,1,t5_2qwwr
6941065,0,t3_4arz98,What happened is that they stopped having anything legitimate to write about. Theyve gone through everything. Theyve kicked the drugs the drink the exwives the interpersonal problems. They have happy families and more money than they know what to do with. They can tour stadia across the globe and sell out or near enough every show to their hearts content. They can finance films. They can collect expensive modern art. Its not always the case but more often than not great music comes out of conflictdifficultystruggle and that goes for lyrics and subject matter too. SA is an example of where that didnt quite happen but DM is an example of an album running on nostalgia rather than anything worth writing lyrics about.

Kirk and Lars however...I feel that they just dont practice or just care less about the live show. Every guitar solo was butchered and had so much wah pedal. Theres no doubt that he masks his sloppy playing with his wah pedal. Even the slow solo stuff like in fade to black... The mistakes stood out so much. Lars while not bad at keeping the beat literally doesnt play whats written on the records. It feels almost made up on the spot and his snare drives me insane. His drumming in the late s and early s was fantastic the Live Shit DVD really showcases that. Getting old isnt an excuse for themyet lmao.

8816077,0,t3_50wlan,Well I disagree. To each their own I guess. Personally I think Sad But True and Of Wolf and Man have plenty of power to them.  If youve been to a Tallica show its hard to imagine your face and brain didnt melt into a gooey puddle during Sad But True  The opening riff is among their heaviest the verse riff is super chunky and the lead up to the solo is epic... ESPECIALLY when they play it live. The hard stop and then moment of silence before the solo is one of their best signature performance pieces.  As for Wolf Jason is so metal the opening riff is just raw tearing guitar then complimented by Lars thumping away like a cave troll.  The main riff is has bite and the live version of the song is definitely one of their more... aggressive.  Kirks solo is also one of his more inspired ones and sets them up perfectly for the relentless raking riff that follows.  I love the sound of raking and this is by far the most of it they do in one song.  It just gives the song a raw and teethy sound.  Just my two pennies...,Metallica,d77kmip,8,t5_2qwwr

After a few listens and getting acquainted with how it flows it feels like the most cohesive metal song Metallica has written since AJFA. I love Death Magnetic but Moth Into Flame has this distinct factor I didnt even notice had been lacking. The song has a drive to it. Its propelled by its own momentum and near the end of it its a juggernaut. St. Anger and less so Death Magnetic meander.

9629801,0,t1_d9zv80n,Yep. Its great a lot of people are enjoying it but outside of the  tracks released as singles a lot of the album falls flat for me. I love the heaviness and grooves on Dream No More but I dont really get the zealousness over the rest of the tracks. From all the hype Spit Out The Bone got I was expecting something like Blackened or Dyers Eve. I mean its an OK song but the middle section feels pretty disjointed to me and overall its a pretty simple but fast song. There are some great moments on the album but from front to back I cant help but feel a little underwhelmed. After DM came out it was a huge return to form and there were glimpses of a return to the RTLMOPAJFA glory days but after this album I think Ive finally accepted that Metallica will never put out an album with as much consistently good song writing as those albums.,Metallica,da02k9f,4,t5_2qwwr

9634556,0,t3_5cym9d,So far I dont feel anything on any song. Mixing and songs structures sound like the songs I didnt like on DM. I feel no progression over the album and almost no progression on any song. The battery pretty much ruins everything else to my ear  too loud and too repetitive. Even not considering the battery the riffs and solos overall leave me uninterested so far and I never liked current Hetfields agressive vocals which are pretty much the only kind of vocals on the album.So far I sincerely receive it as the worst Metallica album worse than St Anger and I dont understand the positive reception at all. Maybe its just my taste that changed over the past few years maybe I turned too much to progdoom metal. I like when there are moments in songs where we can hear notes ring and moments where a clean riff is the only thing left to hear. There were many moments like that in pre Metallica actually it was almost all about these moments in the glorious era and I didnt hear any in this album.I also guess I have to listen to it more but I certainly wont force myself over  times for each song.,Metallica,da0noja,5,t5_2qwwr

9641449,0,t3_5d1d24,I think its not that its a bad song but there are  very similar songs on this album all on the second half Manunkind Am I Savage and Murder One some add Confusion to this list but I think that has a different structure and they are basically variations on the same ideaslow droning groovy insistent heavy rock songs dominated by a single pummelling guitar riff played tirelessly from start to finish so even if you like this type of thing which I do  of them one after another is pretty tiring to listen which makes them look worse in the albums flow then they actually individually are. Murder One is the weakest of these  imo so it gets the most flak. It wouldve been better if it was left out for a Lemmy tribute album or as a single bside or something.,Metallica,da1i9n6,2,t5_2qwwr

10288148,0,t3_5nb5lq,The intro is a nice break into the song however the main riff just doesnt feel like it adds up to the tone of it. Probably what they were going for tho with the lyrical theme but it feels a bit misplaced like how Fade to Black leads into the final riff in comparison to how One leads into its final riff Just starting the riff vs flowing into it.The verse riff is pretty cool it does stand out amongst the song and other riffs in the album and it sounds quite innovative and unlike their more thrashier songs on the album.The chorus is a bit unremarkable nothing interesting really happens there and compared to the tempo of the song with the rest of the songs before and after this it maintains the slow pace which was fairly mediocre and never really grabbed my attention.The riff at  is very Black Sabbathesque Reminds me of Vol. for some reason even tho its probably more like Sabbra Cadabra it wouldve been great if they included that again but having it once would make me want to hear the whole song again just for that moment. And ofc the riff after that its awesome attentiongrabbing and ferocious. It stands out in a kind of House that Jack Builteccentricity with its intro and verse yet the chorus is a bit to generic and uninspired. The riffs following the second chorus too are comparatively a lot less eccentric and more focused on Black Albumlike heaviness. ,Metallica,dca7uc8,2,t5_2qwwr

10396830,0,t3_5oodcm,I for one and many others on different Metallica forums loved the Rasputin gig when it was broadcasted live and came out on LiveMetallica.com because they clearly were in studio mode at the time.Obviously the tracks have been properly mixed and fixed that much is clear because Kirk was totally out of it sometimes during Fade and Ride but it still has that same good feel to it. I cant possibly agree with the ones saying Hetfields vocals doesnt sound great though. No freakin way.Please just go back and listen to some LiveMetallica recordings from  and then put on the Rasputin gig. From  to even  you have some really unfortunate vocal moments and generally weak vocals although it got better in  and . The Rasputin gig is indeed Jamess return to form  and its clear that the studio time and time away from live performances does him a world of good.IMO its the best he have sounded since Prague in .The one problem with the Rasputin vocals if there is one is that he is trying to sing the Kill Em All songs like he used to way before  and that can be annoying but I find that cool as well.Im totally sounding like a Metallica fanboy here and thats probably because I am.,Metallica,dcmjpb9,2,t5_2qwwr

Holy shit!  Radio still didnt play any kind of metalglam rock doesnt count and Metallica were showing everyone why they are who they are.  AJFA tour that year was immense.  Saw them  times that year.  I drove to see them at Cal Expo in Sacramento.  They cancelled the show that night because of thunder and lightning.  They held the show the next night.  Faith No More opened up and Mike Patton came out on stage in scuba gear.

That riff is groovy is hell and the drumming and time signatures are intricate and unique.Here Comes Revenge is good but definitely has its flaws. The drums make the song sound slower than what it should be and James yells Revenge a few too many times in the chorus. Great riffs though.The breakdown in Am I Savage? is the highlight of the album but the rest of the song is a lot weaker.Confusion has some great riffs and I like the verses but the song just feels too forced. It reminds me too much of Cyanide. The riff leading into the chorus just sort of pastes itself into the song and it feels unnatural. I cant get into Murder One. Nothing about that song grabs me.

At the same time Ive come to love thrash style rock even more  I just dont see Metallica as being overly great at that kind of music.

Youve got GA tickets so spend some of the show in the thick of it bouncing around with all of the fine people that like to bounce around. Find the mosh pit and at least hang around the edge if you feel up to it take a spin around. Everyone looks scary but the minute you stumble  people will pick you up. Then spend some of the show hanging back with the more laid back types. Mingle take a long walk to the restroom eat drink and be merry.

Im an RTL man as its the more raw of the two and has For Whom The Bell Tolls and Creeping Death  their two best. If you prefer more polished fare then Master will be for you. Stay away from St Anger and LoadReload youll thank me. No one talks about Lulu for good reason.

11196975,0,t3_5zslaf,Lars gets a bad rap.Yes Napster was bad.  But only because he was the face of truth.  It was stealing.  Bands live off album sales and that was money they were not seeing.  Yes they are rich it was greedy to say but if you were an artist and trying to sell albums to male a living and someone just took it for free that would suck and upset you.  Music still has not financially recovered. So many bands dont make it because no on buys music.  I am a hypocrite looking back  I downloaded music.  I justified it by saying most of what I downloaded was stuff I had on tape which is true.  I stream stuff off youtube these days and if I like it I always buy a copy.People also call Lars and Hetfield control freaks.  They are it is true.  But Metallica is theirs and they run it like it is their business.  People get a say but they make the final decision.   And you know what he is a know it all... but he is actually right more than not.  Watching Some Kind of Monster really gave me an understanding of them and an appreciation. I will watch this when I can find it.,Metallica,df15wfa,19,t5_2qwwr
