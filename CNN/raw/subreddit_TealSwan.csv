6246019,0,t3_414uda,gtRemember this year that if we resist purification we will be in pain.  But if we can instead jump on board with purification and be willing to be stripped naked by life both internally and externally if we can instead be willing to allow life as we know it to be stripped to its essence around us what will be left is pristine and pure and authentic and genuine and real.  Approach this year with curiosity as if you do not yet know what the outcome will be.  You will experience revelation.gtApproach this year as if you do not yet see what will be revealed as you uncover your true self.  Approach this year as if you are wiping a layer of mud off the surface of a painting having no idea what image lies beneath.  Jump on board with refining yourself your life and the world you live in.  Let yourself and your life be stripped clean.gtAnd whenever you run into a problem or upset this year ask yourself the following question How does this apply to purification?  What form of pollution is being purified from what essence in this situation?,TealSwan,cyzlrwz,2,t5_2zq9w
