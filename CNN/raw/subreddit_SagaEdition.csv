4125901,0,t1_crq7u5m,Yeah I floated him the idea of being kinda like a powerful information broker. in the vein of the Shadow Broker from Mass Effect and I think he liked it as a goal which would entail some noble stuff and going Crime Lord.,SagaEdition,crqkt77,2,t5_2zkcf

5560009,0,t1_cwi2rsx,I really like the idea of making it hard to operate and will definitely incorporate that into it. I think im going to go the route of an army which the group finds and can control. Maybe make it a prototype star forge which produced a second smaller fleet and was not destroyed or ever found till now. I am hoping that it really enlarges the scope of the game if the players can send units or fleets around the galaxy rather than the small scale things they have been doing so far. Thanks for the reply!,SagaEdition,cwm9qch,1,t5_2zkcf

6293556,0,t3_41su6h,They could be Sith Acolytes the Empire forgot about. Up to a point the early training of both groups is pretty similar and if youve played the KOTOR games you know that that doesnt automatically make them dark.,SagaEdition,cz508qr,1,t5_2zkcf
6734631,0,t3_47uace,There are rules for this are in the Galaxy at War book on page  including costs and some example cybernetic upgrades.,SagaEdition,d0fx44n,3,t5_2zkcf

7444162,0,t3_4gujvu,And on another note one of my players would like to know if either someone has built a Mr. Handy from Fallout using the droid rules or if their is an analogue in one of the books? They mentioned they might need like a companion or something like navigation or ya know butler.Would someone be able to point me in the right direction as I havent played Fallout yet but would like to indulge this player if they can afford it.,SagaEdition,d2ocqz4,1,t5_2zkcf
7445556,0,t1_d2obhyt,Heres a link to the swd to saga converter pdf.Fast healing is incredibly powerful. I would limit it to  or  points per round or even per minute. If you offer d then you could heal  hp per minute out of combat and it really unbalances things. Most races get ability scores adjusted and then get  extras plus a specific bonus feat or skill bonus. Very human like ones dont get ability score adjusted think Zabrak.Heres what I would do for a Furyan...Ability scores no adjustmentsMedium size speed  squaresEye Shine Darkvision same as trandosiansullustanExtraordinary Recuperation heal wounds at double the normal rate taken directly from wookieBonus feat Furyans gain toughness as a bonus feat.Honed Senses Furyans gain  to all defenses optional additionsAnimal Affinity  racial bonus on checks involving animals persuasion survivial rideLight blindness in bright light furyans are effectively blind requiring special goggles to see normally same as Kel dorAs a race this puts them probably into the top rd power wise and encompasses most of riddicks racial abilities that wouldnt be covered by a class and stats.,SagaEdition,d2oiger,1,t5_2zkcf
7462038,0,t3_4hklx0,Yeah definitely a bit inferior mechanically.Not terrible if you like defenses and perception. But basically like a human whose choices have already been made for him,SagaEdition,d2qdyoj,1,t5_2zkcf

8622746,0,t1_d6jet7e,I think its pretty obvious that we arent going to agree on the matter so I dont see the point in arguing with you. I do want to make one thing clear however This is a subreddit for Saga Edition players and since the only way that the outofprint expiredlicense RPG can be played by newcomers is by digital redistribution of PDFs of the books that redistribution is not going to be discouraged here. If you arent comfortable with that I would suggest that you attempt to find a different Saga Edition community to partake in. Please dont stir up this sort of drama here in the future.,SagaEdition,d6jg0tm,3,t5_2zkcf
9032840,0,t3_53zbs8,Well the biggest issue is more how is there a Sith during the end of the Rule of Two? But that isnt too important for now but it is something you should think about.Now as for advice... Expect for conflict. Rather plan for it. Verbal or even physical altercations between the two are inevitable so as the GM you should plan a few situations for when this occurs. For instance maybe they get attacked by a Mandalorian vessel during one of their fights and they need to decide whats more important their conflict or their lives.Second make sure that the Sith had a few restrictions. I wouldnt allow him to play Chaotic Evil or even Neutral Evil because both of those can be actively detrimental to a nonevil party. Admittedly Lawful Evil can be too but not as inherently. You should also make sure he isnt playing Lawful Stupid either. Evil is not an excuse to do stupid things nor be actively detrimental to the flow of the game.Finally make sure the Sith and the Jedi have some reason to work together. Establish the greater threat early enough that they are willing to put aside their conflict for the greater good. The Sith might not be all about the greater good but they care enough about themselves to make sure they arent at risk.,SagaEdition,d7xlrky,3,t5_2zkcf
9379593,0,t1_d94wa1b,Thank you. I forgot about that. That being the case the Vibrorapier is probably the best option for the combo.,SagaEdition,d94xhuh,2,t5_2zkcf
9884591,0,t3_5gwko4,You can try this if you have a windows device handy. There is also a spread sheet that can be useful.Really the saga continues file compilation is a great resource in general. Also in the side bar.,SagaEdition,davzi4e,2,t5_2zkcf

10127894,0,t1_dbrf05x,Wouldnt it be more fitting to have it have a firing mode selector installed? His weapon strikes me as a repeater with a power generator hooked up on his back.,SagaEdition,dbro5b9,3,t5_2zkcf
10202959,0,t1_dc036fw,Not true. Ion does loads against more than just walkers. Pretty much any droid or piece of equipment is at risk with that thing. Anybody with cybernetics is in for a bad day. Not to mention what happens when a character takes one off a UWing and totes it around? Ion does affect organics. It only does  of the damage but it can still have an effect. Sure the average damage on that gun is .  rounding down which becomes about  points of damage to an organic. But if it can autofire or have any number of featstalents combined with it it could be a bad time for those organics. But lets say that character decides instead they are gonna target the weaponsarmorequipment the guy is wearing. Yeah sure he takes some penalties for like called shots or whatever or size penalties I forget the exact term at the moment but in exchange he can roll a really ugly amount of damage.As far as house ruling yeah sure. To each their own and if you run games as RAW then more power to you. I find that each table and group does it different and some house rules can make things much better. For example attacking that leg means it should not have DR by itself. Its just a component of the walker and as such would not have a full HP and Dr and Sr if so equipped the ATAT isnt so it would make sense to drop those numbers. The amount to drop is up to the GM for what seams reasonable. I mean if I shoot a tire on your car you can still drive it only one component was broken. While much larger and having bigger ramifications the walker will probably topple over and be useless the same idea applies here. Again what would happen if we shot a rocket and took out a tanks treads? Assuming we didnt destroy the tank then we could assume that the vehicle still has some utility  maybe the guns still work or something.Im not talking about making new stats for the leg or anything. You can use the stats as is but the leg might have say hp and dr  which can be adjusted to your liking.,SagaEdition,dc0k9dt,1,t5_2zkcf
10807656,0,t3_5uhr6w,Excellent. Thanks guys. Ive been working on a campaign  got the story down and wanted to whip up a few character sheets to run some battles and get a feel for things but got confused real quick. Thanks! ,SagaEdition,dduqfc9,1,t5_2zkcf
11034794,0,t1_deifvz5,Many of my favorite techie builds are good in combat as I start them in SOLDIER which may not have the Knowledge but has the other skills.I know what you mean about thinking that a large vehicle probably can fit on the character scale board.  It generally does bring in a bit more firepower and you may consider reducing the effective CL of opponents for XP and to figure challenges in response to it SotG mentions reducing the oppositions effective CL by half of whatever the base CL of the vehicle they are using.  If you keep the PC sitting in the open you may be ok but just imagine putting a Hutt with Force Pilot in a covered combat pod.I guess Id warn the would be walker drive while stopping to spend the actions needed to AimBrace an attack may be possible but keep in mind the penalties for an uncontrolled or stationary vehicle.  Uncontrolled has it lose it DEX bonus to REF and Id also be assigning at least a  penalty to any attacks made from the vehicle as it would suffer if being Flown Defensively.  If the vehicle is stopped that means it gets treated as REF .I generally would concentrate more on boosting my attack values instead of spending character resources to cut an occasional penalty.  The two may be functionally similar so consider the cost.,SagaEdition,deirp03,1,t5_2zkcf
