6185757,0,t3_404o4e,Thanks for looking into this issue in more detail. It has been a major sticking point for me since I started noticing rapid battery drains on a couple of the HGB Xubuntu builds a while back. It also means I have to switch over to Chrome OS if I am going to be working on battery power for more than a few hours.

6233742,0,t1_cyy6yzr,Nope. Running dsdrv in the terminal gives me this errorgt IOError could not open uinput device in write modeSo Im assuming that it is a permission problem which is weird because it also happens if I am running gt sudo dsdrvin the terminal. Creating up a .rules file in etcudevrules.d with gt KERNELuinput GROUPuinput MODE didnt help either.,GalliumOS,cyy7isr,1,t5_39qk8
6439745,0,t1_czldr1t,Those error reports go to Ubuntu unfortunately.If your sound still isnt working after a full pkg update you might need to experiment with audio sinks from the panel icon on the bottom of the screen. If that doesnt work open the volume control window and check that internal analog is selected.The sound applet is really unfriendly. But Haswell audio should work out of the box Im not sure why yours is not. Stay tuned for the beta announcement. Hopefully it resolves some other issues for you. Thanks!,GalliumOS,czlepkl,1,t5_39qk8
6504752,0,t3_3seadq,Hi all! Just got my first chromebook the Dell Chromebook  with the i  GB of ram and touch screen. First impression of Chrome OS is really good but would like a light Linux distribution as well. Ive tried installing Ubuntu XFCE with crouton but I really need a more clean setup so a dual boot solution would be preferred. However as much as I have looked youtube google etc. I havnt seen an example of how exactly dual boot looks. Will you see a regular dual boot screen this e.g. Chrome OS and Gallium OS? Will you still get the warning concerning Developer Mode? Will GalliumOS be a good starting point for learning Linux and terminal?  Anyone tried this process for the Dell Chromebook  that can give me some heads up  pointers before going at it?Much appreciated!,GalliumOS,czs522j,1,t5_39qk8
6589931,0,t1_d00uai9,Yes. The timing depends on the firmware. I typically run stock firmware since thats what most chrx users will have. It actually prefers a USB bootable drive if there is one so I dont have to mess with the boot menu at all.Note that the device boot menu is different from the GRUB boot menu which you can access by a welltimed ESC immediately after seeing the Booting from Hard Disk... message.,GalliumOS,d00yb4g,1,t5_39qk8
6620209,0,t1_d0411al,In the case of a startup script enabled means working. The script executes and the exits so it will not be longrunning. A longrunning server will report Active active running. So yes that looks good.Note that I and GalliumOS am are not responsible for the difficult to parse output of systemctl status. Its a new thing in Linux and lots of people hate it and lots of people love it. Im deeply ambivalent personally but it is what it is. You third person nonspecific learn it because you cant possibly fix all the things.Youre not wrong about GUIs. But you second person specific have to come to terms with the fact that the people who build Linux do not focus on ordinary users or on championing migration from more userfriendly systems. GalliumOS cannot solve that problem and does not have the resources to try. This is a general statement.In the particular Powertop case I agree that we need to evaluate it and either a build the config into the distro or b post clear and simple instructions on how and why to consider installing it. It is extremely unlikely that we will build a GUI for it.,GalliumOS,d0434sr,1,t5_39qk8

6766567,0,t1_d0j9mof,The reason why I recommend dualbooting is because of the legacy boot bug when your battery completely depletes. There have been other posts about this little quirk here. TLDR when your battery goes flat the legacy boot flag resets to zero which means you cant CtrlL into your linux install. If you have ChromeOS still on your system this is as easy to fix as booting into ChromeOS and resetting the flag in a shell if you dont have ChromeOS AFAIK youll have to recover ChromeOS from a USB and reset the flags therefore wiping your GalliumOS install.,GalliumOS,d0j9qbs,1,t5_39qk8

6902855,0,t3_4aals0,That happening when the battery dies sounds... strange but plausible as in it sounds like something that could happen. But obviously it happened to you so thats a moot point. What is strange is that your clock problem is occurring even on reboot. Usually the clock resets to some bizarre date in the future if the battery is disconnected. Perhaps its a hardware thing that every time you reboot the battery effectively disconnects itself.It could be unrelated but have you flashed firmware? If so what kind? Not saying thats your issue but it could help us figure out whats going on.,GalliumOS,d0yra0c,2,t5_39qk8
