If you cant leave for whatever reason then you need to accept its faults and try and make light of it otherwise you will become a miserable person. There are worse places in the world that one could end up in. I guess she did the right thing for herself by leaving but it sucks that she feels she needs to tell other people not to move here.

28985,0,t3_1ufy1o,Amazingly enough I had really great luck at a place called Guardian Storage on W th Ave just a few blocks from the MEC store.The owner was super helpful easy going and let me move my stuff in two weeks early at no extra cost. I rented a unit for  months while travelling and got a x unit for month. Not super cheap but so convenient for what I needed.Only downside were the hours  basically open business hours and not full days SatSun. But then I was only moving my stuff about  blocks so it was ridiculously convenient.I dunno if theres any mice concern  I had no problems in any way the place felt pretty secure and comfortable and I never felt worried. I even missed a payment my wallet was stolen while overseas cancelled my credit cards and before I could get to my replacements a payment had been missed and the owner was easy and relaxed with communication by email when I could find sketchy wifi.Totally recommend checking it out if you want to stay in Vancouver.,vancouver,cehqd9r,3,t5_2qhov

I quickly deduced the answer clicked okay at which point a big notification popped up asking if I was sure.  Yes yes of course Im sure just give me my laptop was what went through my head as I clicked okay only to get a giant red X with a wrong the answer is .....  Someone had forgotten his BEDMAS.

On wreck beach just write a ticket for people who arent bothering anybody and boom money in the bank.Im pretty sure they give out harassing tickets in the DTES but nobody has any money to pay.  I thought I read something about how they were planning to use everybodys unpaid tickets as an excuse to cart the homeless people off during the olympics.

However the act allows for more serious punishments including jail time.Given that their resources are limited theres a very good chance that the police and bylaw officers have a policy of mainly ticketing  and turning a blind eye to some degree.  However when somebody has been fined multiple times and the police are handed the whereabouts and reasonable grounds to obtain a warrant for her manufacturing premises  then they can and in this case did opt for an investigation and more serious charges.According to  this article  it would appear that she wasnt keeping a low profile and loud and obnoxious and in everybodys faces.

The bare minimum insurance wont cover the ensuing insurance claimlawsuit and this could cost you millions of dollars.  Sure skip the comprehensive and collision if you want but having anything under m liability is just asking for trouble.

350415,1,t1_cfh20d0,I do see your point as to why captivity may lead people to care about animals... but my main issue is that it isnt the ONLY way to do it. I feel like if I was given the change to an alternate path to where I am now as a child I would still love these animals just the same. Wild orcas are so much more amazing and insanely beautiful even just on video than the bells and whistles that aquariums give.Like I said I feel extremely guilty about how I came to see these animals for the first time... but seeing them in the aquarium wasnt what birthed my passion for them. I think that was more superficial childhood wonder... and I know for a fact that I didnt learn anything of value at the aquarium. I wish no one took me to the aquarium as a kid. I oppose captivity not only out of compassion for the animals.. but compassion for children who may one day realize what theyve been involved in. In my childhood brain I wanted to BE a whale trainer... I wanted to go out help capture them and train them in those tanks. It took the death of Bijossa to kickstart my absolute hatred for the industry that harms the animals Ive grown to love more than ever by watching them in the wild. This summer I may get a chance to whale watch whenever I want and even kayak with them through a job I am pursuing. Obviously I dont expect everyone to be able to do this... but its something Ive been able to push myself towards... not because I saw them in an aquarium as a child... but because I value learning about animals in their natural habitats... and I think I would have valued it either way if my family didnt lazily accept my superficial desire to see them in an artificial environment.I think we can both agree that parents need to take the initiative and put greater emphasis on educating their children even if it bores them... rather than being lazy and taking them somewhere just so they can feel like they are doing their job.,vancouver,cfh36pk,-2,t5_2qhov

Another example is the  Beef patties at McDonalds. Also in some instances of the knock offs they combine maple syrup and corn syrup as a filler. Unlike  Maple Syrup the real stuff comes in  grades A B C and D.  It goes from thickest to thinnest and since maple syrup is evaporated tree sap the thicker grade requires more evaporation and can be more expensive. To find the real stuff you have to get it from its source Quebec.  ,vancouver,cflynev,-1,t5_2qhov

455600,0,t3_1z4wpn,The last  weeks have been pretty good in terms of snowfall and has helped consolidate to bring the base up past  cm. Theres another storm coming in tomorrow that should continue through to wednesday.  What i usually do when trying to figure out the forecast is first checking out   The thing to keep in mind is that the forecast can change hourly so its good to check it frequently.  I then cross reference that with the mountain website to see what they are saying about current conditions.  The last thing i check is to see what the Vancouver forecast is looking like because i have found there to be about a c degree difference between the peaks of the north shore mountains cypress seymour and grouse and Southern Vancouver  i live in richmond.  Basically if Vancouver is saying c for the next day and the cypress website is saying that its gonna snow i know its not gonna happen cause the temp is probably gonna be sitting closer to c not cold enough for snow.  snowforecast.com is good for information on the windchill and whatnot and is better at predicting conditions for the mountain later in the week. On that note Whistler is looking REALLY good for this week.,vancouver,cfs1ty0,2,t5_2qhov

No one in their right mind would buy those things at full price  who knows what might happen when its time to renegotiate?Look at what happened in The most famous example of a hike in lease payments was in  when Musqueam Park leases came up for renewal after  years.

I dont want labels to be filled with unessential elements because that would undermine the seriousness of other notices such as allergens.If there was a scientific reason to label GM foods Id be all for it. I dont want labeling to be based on peoples misunderstanding of the science and facts. The problem is that would open the door to other nonsense.If we have the right to know is the only criteria then what comes next? How long do you want the labels to be? Further how many people who have the right to know does it take before we add it to the label? Step back for a moment and consider all of the conspiracy theories people have. Do you want all of those to be on the labels? Wouldnt you rather labeling to be based on scientific facts rather than the whims of whoever is just shouting loudest?Edit Further what will mandatory labeling provide that volunteer labeling doesnt? Why get the government even more involved when the free market can sort it out? If some people want GMOfree food let them pay more for it if they want that luxury.Edit  Also keep in mind that GMOs arent one thing. Each GMO is completely different. GM is simply a process. Think about it for a moment does This ingredient was made from crossbreeding add any real information? Do crossbred foods have very much in common with each other? For example we have the case of the crossbred poisoned potato but does that mean that other crossbred foods are very similar? Should we lump all crossbred foods together?

947867,0,t1_chbzwzg,I believe the core disagreement here is that were asking people to pay more to support those increased property values. I dont see why anyone that doesnt benefit from it should have to pay the difference. Perhaps since they benefit so directly they should chip in more for that luxury. Basically Im saying I dont care they can pay the difference if it means that much to them. The character of a neighborhood has never been used to justify additional cost for public infrastructure and shouldnt in this case. If the residents wish I have no problem with them paying the difference. There is no reason why someone in Surrey Richmond Port Coquitlam Burnaby etc. should pay an extra  over their lives so that someone on the west side can have a tunnel rather than a skytrain.The transition from tunnel to track is seamless and requires simply a lot or area it wouldnt be done on the street side but on a corner lot or a couple of lots,vancouver,chc131n,1,t5_2qhov

Since Allen Edmonds are made in the US you dont have to pay duty only HST shipping and brokerage fees. When I bought Park Avenues from Amazon I paid about  in import fees roughly half of which was HST which youd have to pay instore so youre probably looking at  all in. Note the import fees deposit will be higher than what you end up paying since the estimator is for some reason unaware that theyre American made so youll end up getting a refund when Amazon actually pays the import fees.

1090830,0,t1_chrmeoh,Teachers are employed by the government so their salaries cannot be tied to profits or the economy so they use inflation or cost of living as an index. A conservative government in surplus will cut taxes before giving the public sector raises IME. As a result the unions will always ask for a raise in any negotiation because its not going to come without demanding it. Cost of living has increased so they ask for a raise. This is negotiation after all. It would be something to concede in order to get something from their other demands. The rub is that the other demands are far more costly. The goal of increased class sizes and reduced restrictions on class composition is wiggle room for laying off teachers. This is a big cost reduction to the education system. If the government can concede a small raise yet come out with full control over class sizes and composition they will. If they give  raise to all teachers but lay off  teacher in  they approximately break even. Didnt the government come into the negotiation offering a raise signing bonus?I believe that the education system needs more staff especially in the inner city schools with large numbers of at risk kids. This is the real social safety net. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure as they say. If you can get these kids to be a productive part of society it is a big boon to future generations. Its not going to happen though as nobody wants to pay for it.Teaching is a brutal job just ask Tony Danza,vancouver,chsa3z9,4,t5_2qhov

I wanted a house thats what houses cost nobody would sell me a house for less so I bought it.Are you going to blame the person who sold me my house? They know that someone will buy it for half a mil why would they be stupid and charitable and sell it for any less? The goal as a seller is always to get the most you can youd be a fool not to.Are you going to blame the government? I really dont know what they could do What would you do? Would you do something who cares what to depress the price of all the houses? Now youre fucking over all the homeowners in order to benefit people who dont yet own homes. How is this fair?

1302119,0,t3_28zuq8,Moved here from Toronto for a little over  years ago.Relocated for the job I currently have. The experience has been good overall. It took about  years to adjust to the city and stop expecting it to be like Toronto. There is less variety its harder to get around and it was hard breaking into social circles here. Its taken some time but things are good. The job pays well enough and Ive got a good group a friends here. I dont regret my choice in moving out here but if I got to do it all over again Id stay in Toronto. Its the better of the two cities. Oh and ICBC sucks. It shouldnt take  min to explain to someone that as a born Canadian citizen I dont have a citizenship card and demanding I show it to you wont make it magically appear. ,vancouver,cig3sei,1,t5_2qhov

1401776,0,t1_ciryw03,Thats an excellent point although Id guess that nextlevel of sophistication i.e. counterfeiting wouldnt likely be a significant percentage of fare evasion. How much evasion occurs in todays system by producing fake magstripe passes or even fake monthly passes? Probably a very small fraction as much as occurs as a result of simple fare evasion.Id also guess that bus drivers will not suddenly start enforcing payment just because the system uses RFID or because it cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The risk of assaults and whatnot remains  youll get the same cursory check from a driver but they wont argue with a violent passenger. Theres also nothing to prevent someone from boarding a BLine at the back doors and scanning absolutely nothing.The mechanism for handling these scenarios will be just the same as it is today. I fully expect that Transit Police will continue to spot check fares onboard buses and that they could validate cards in realtime if necessary.The compass system cannot really stop fare evasion on buses so Translink needs to give up the ghost and just make legitimate billing as efficient and quick as possible. Fare evasion cannot be a priority in this context because it cant work anyway. I suspect that the only reason Compass is being put onto buses at all is to integrate legitimate use of the system across all means of conveyance so they need to make legitimate use the priority.The system is sort of a disaster insofar as buses are concerned. Its a huge boondoggle and huge waste of money that solves absolutely no problems.,vancouver,cirzr6q,8,t5_2qhov

1641461,1,t3_2d4rh3,Aside from rent food is my biggest expense too. I work physical labour and eat pretty much all day while I work and heres what I do.. Pack your own lunches for work. Saves a lot of cash since it adds up to a lot every month to buy pre made lunches. Make home made hummus and a bunch of fruit for lunch. . I eat a lot of hummus too. Its crazy expensive to buy from the store. Buy a food processor from London Drugs or from a thrift store or wherever and make your own hummus. If you buy dried chickpeas from bulk and soak them instead of buying them from a can and it costs pennies to make. With a food processor you can also make guacamole soups sour kraut and whatever else that usually costs a lot at the store. These can be made ahead of time and brought for lunches.. Oatmeal sucks for breakfast since its not very filling. Try eating quinoa even though it is a bit pricy mixed with yogurt or milk with frozen fruit mixed into it in one of those food carrier things that keep food cool. I dont particularly like quinoa but a few tablespoons of it is actually really filling and cooked properly isnt mushy and gross..

1727612,0,t3_2e5nmi,What it boils down to is that we cannot legislate based on anecdotes. So while some bikes may have loud or even obnoxious exhaust systems we cant penalize the larger majority of conscientious bikers who use acceptably louderthanstock systems for the exact reasons which you refuse to accept such as visibility and forcing drivers on the road to be aware of you. This is especially important when it comes to riding near tractortrailers as the majority of the space around each one is a blind spot and they themselves are quite noisy.  But the core issue is whether or not people have the right to offend without legal repercussions. Its why people can build ugly houses wear baseball caps backwards ride bicycles drink booze etc. Just because were offended by something doesnt mean we can lambaste the offender into next Tuesday. ,vancouver,cjwxhww,1,t5_2qhov

However going back to the above if i feel that my boundaries are being shat on or Im being treated in an abusive manner then im going to reiterate whats acceptable treatment or behaviour then step back.

The teachers will approve this begrudgingly but this fight needs to continue.The pressure on the government has to continue in order to get more funding for the school boards for infrastructure and operations. They keep breaking even on their budgets and the government responds with more cuts. Now programs are being cut. My wifes school has asbestos chairs and the computers in the lab have Gb of RAM.You know whos being taxed to run the schools? The parents and teachers. They supply and buy the goods for fund raisers. They chip in for supplies field trips etc. Its getting so that we have practically semiprivate schools where wealthy parents donate items to their childrens school. Why pay  for one year at a top school when you could donate that money to a public school? Theres a school in west van where every student was supplied with an iPad. This is not helping the child poverty issue one bit.All of this is to say that pressure on the government needs to continue to minimize the damage over the next few years.

2085568,0,t1_cl4wjbl,I dont think its necessary to completely understand every detail of evolution to understand it. No ones asking that. But you should understand the broad strokes at least which it seems like you do.Science is complicated these days. I recently was completely lost as to how scientists can discover what planets in solar systems many light years away are composed of. After a bit of reading I discovered that it is a mix of light fluctuations from the star as the planet passes in front of it and spectrometer readings that look for certain types of radiation. Now do I understand how every piece of that works? Could I explain it in detail to an alien? No. But thats a much healthier understanding than well shit I dont get it it must be god or something.Im only acting like I understand as much as I do. Thats not dangerous. Knowing the basics for this stuff means that when I then have to just believe the rest of it theres a lot less blind faith that the scientists are right because I can logically understand how what I know leads to what they know.,vancouver,cl4x6ly,1,t5_2qhov

2142529,0,t3_2jiade,If youre curious about how much youll be approved for use a mortgage calculator. If you want a more in depth explanation as to how you figure out the numbers An underwriter looks at many things but mainly to see if numbers fall within their lending guidlines.They care about Gross Debt Service ratio and Total Debt Service ratio.For example a typical bank will lend you whatever amount up money up to say... GDS and  TDS. IF you are going through CMHC the max your GDS can be is . Ill use that in my example.GDS  All income required to cover the cost of the home mortage payment heating strata property tax.TDS  All debts in total GDS plus loan payments LOC payments Car paymentsSo say you make  Grand a year. You have no loans as your car is free title and you have a . limit credit card. The minimum payment for that would be  of the highest balance  dollars added to TDS.Lets just pick some numbersK   a month before taxesMortgage payment on your new condo  Condo fees per month   you have a poolProperty taxes per month  Heating bill      TDS would be everything so       So that being said youre feeling good about your odds and you opt for a Variable rate mortgage. UYou have great credit and you qualify for a good rate of Prime  .. Max you can go on a CMHC mortgage is  years.

Toronto has a lower rate . with smaller cities such as Saskatoon and Lethbridge having around half the rate .So it would appear that it is not true that homeless people flock to Vancouver. Indeed the likely arguments are that homeless people flock to larger cities better employment etc or that larger cities are more likely to create homelessness higher living expenses possibly lower incomes.I believe some possible reasons why Vancouver stands out are Our homeless population is largely concentrated in the DTES whereas it would be more spread out elsewhere Our homeless population seems to be more united than in other cities allowing them to voice their concerns better We live here relevance bias affects us.,vancouver,clf3of8,1,t5_2qhov

If you want to use it at all you have to pay to have it tuned every couple of years at several hundred dollars plus any string replacements that are deemed necessary.  Then theres the fact that this thing will sit somewhere in your house and consume  square feet of usable space when you factor in clearance etc.  Plus you have to make sure that wherever it sits the floor underneath is up to the task both structurally and the surface itself is able to take all that weight on  or  small points.

2349719,0,t1_cm242ms,No this is literally treasongt TreasonEvery one commits treason who in Canadaa uses force or violence for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Canada or a provinceb without lawful authority communicates or makes available to an agent of a state other than Canada military or scientific information or any sketch plan model article note or document of a military or scientific character that he knows or ought to know may be used by that state for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or defence of Canadac conspires with any person to commit high treason or to do anything mentioned in paragraph ad forms an intention to do anything that is high treason or that is mentioned in paragraph a and manifests that intention by an overt act ore conspires with any person to do anything mentioned in paragraph b or forms an intention to do anything mentioned in paragraph b and manifests that intention by an overt act.No one is selling out the country there is no reason to believe that these Chinese nationals owning property who you accuse of maybe being intelligence agents are somehow out to destabilize the country. At most it is an ill advised lack of regulation of the housing market where speculation is distorting things to a dangerous level which in no way requires targeting the Chinese. Canadian citizens who pollute and ruthlessly climb the economic ladder do far more to harm the state than these Chinese nationals. Also there is no country called Korea I assume you mean the DPRK.  I never heard that the Chinese government was attempting to destabilize Canada by allowing rich nationals to flee with money Capital flight being a huge problem for China. Perhaps you are referring to the facts that A It often requires greasing the wheels to get capital out of China which is not a giant conspiracy just simply corruption and B The fact that China does actively spy on Canada which again doesnt really have anything to do with foreign ownership of property. As far as quid proquo that makes no sense. Why should Canada punish itself because China has backwards ass property laws which it is actively reforming? Demanding a reciprocal relationship only makes sense when one party is screwing over another. If it were the Chinese government buying up the properties and they bared Canada from doing the same then it is problematic but since this issue is between private individuals and the Canadian government how poorly the PRC wants to treat foreign buyers is of no consequence to Canada as they arent a party directly involved in the process. Your tariff sentence makes no sense. What are we putting a tariff on why countries with a larger GDP not to mention our neighbour with a much larger GDP has a legal agreement baring us from doing so. Why are we putting a tariff on them? Them having a larger GDP may be one of the worst ways to determine who pays the tariff I have ever heard. And PS while I am not sure why you brought up the construction industry or the Vancouver job markets future Vancouver wont return to how it was. It used to be a forestry and mining town it will never be that again mining company jobs are scarce going to be more scarce and foresty is following suit. ITSoftware development isnt going to go anywhere in the long run as soon as the visa issues are sorted all those satallite offices in Vancouver will close and other Canadian cities even rvancouvers whipping boy Calgary have much better startup scenes due to access to capital Calgary has more start ups per capita then Vancouver. If Vancouver ever wants to be more then an overpriced Honolulu then it has to look to becoming East Asias regional office hub especially after we turned all our industrial land into condos. Simply baring foreigners from setting up shop is going to send the wrong message.,vancouver,cm24wzs,2,t5_2qhov

2376247,0,t1_cm54qje,gtYes there is the possibility that the owner of the property you are renting is carrying a chunk of the cost they may well be if they havent paid the mortgage alreadyOf course there is always this cost if you borrow from the Bank of Canada or the Bank of you.. well unless you count that outlayequity as Dead capital.. there is always a cost of carry if you count it on your balance sheet or just in your headThe bad thing about that dead capital .. is that it is the first to go and most of it is illusory because most people dont factor the cost to liquidate or reacquisition costs if they decided to repurchase in Real estate.gtThe owner is taking a loss on you as a tenant? So what. You pay rent and part of that rent in some small way contributes to the taxes insurance mortgage payments etc that are paid on the property.This is the statist argument one hears when they are trying to get out of a speeding ticket  I PAY your Salary  Yes I am sure that some portion of the rent is apportioned to taxes repair maintenance mortgage costs interest and profit... by my contribution is capped at a fixed rate no matter what the costs may be of course if those costs go up the landlord may wish to try and increase the rents of course the  market will have to sort it out when it comes..gt above the expenses of the maintaining the property including debt service. That said my rental properties are condos not detached homes lower margins there. Over and above that each of the properties I have purchased have increased in assessed value by over  and in one case  since acquiring them.That is great for you let us hope that escalator goes to the sky because if it ever stops or turns into an elevator.. the high  of rental properties will may can make that pool of equity vanish quickly but it sounds like you have got it all squared and are doing  well congratulations on that gtmeaning that if I wanted to achieve better returns I would have to move into much higher risk investments such as stocks or venturesA very quick way to turn all your profits into dust IMHOkeep up the good work,vancouver,cm5evbu,1,t5_2qhov

2413808,0,t1_cm9p0dg,gt Theres gotta be a way to explain this that actually distinguishes dogs from cats.Dogs are pack animals and when outside are most comfortable sticking with those theyre familiar with and making forays away from the nucleus and returning. This blends well with leashes especially variablelength leashes and so most dogs can feel comfortable and safe using them. Cats on the other hand are generally solitary and navigate through stealth. Theyre most comfortable when alone and under cover or at least having the ability to quickly get under cover. A cats normal outdoor navigation has them beneath hedges under cars and moving from cover to cover. A leash restricts them from that in the worst possible way and very few cats will tolerate a leash of any kind. It makes them anxious their instinct is to take off and hide the leash prevents that and then they totally freak out. ,vancouver,cma20ft,1,t5_2qhov

2576012,0,t1_cmue8cs,Lower tier tech shops pretty much  of vancouver are able to demand lower prices because of the saturated marketplace filled with people who are desperate for jobs. They know this so they are able to burn through people. One company in Vancouver did this consistently for the past  years and their reputation has gotten so bad that they have trouble acquiring talent.I was self taught didnt have much FOSS projects although I did have a github account with just random crap. I found that none of this really mattered it was just based on understanding of the underlying technologies and the confidence you exhibited during the interviews. Getting the technical questions right is the most important thing.Ive worked for  shops in the past  years one was a well known startup and the other smaller startup companies. My salary started from k and then each new company I Went to I negotiated for k increase. I found that if you did not negotiate there was no way you could get more money. Lot of cultures are quite shy about this aspect but you are selling yourself you should get the best possible price.Ive personally seen a senior engineer and the code they produce for what they are paid to do arent any good or different than run of the mill. It all comes based on the years of experience you have and in Vancouver its paticularly high senior jobs requiring  years for low salary compared to what US pays.If I could start all over again I wouldve passed off working in Vancouver as a software dev and straight to freelancing.The remote job offers are far more lucrative k USD no commute.

2611154,0,t1_cmzemcr,gt What should be the increase in the property tax in say Burnaby and Langley which have lower transit use then Vancouver?thats up to Burnaby or Langley to decide whatever the cost is they should cover or if they want to be linked to vancouver at all. gtMetro Vancouver and Translink have their own regional plans that do focus on corestown centers. A government cannot easily decide to build a city core. Those who try will be surprised by the cost and natural flow of economic forces. Just look at china. They have too many people which they admit and they built brand new cities for them. But nope they decided to stay cramped up where they are now and let the new city stay empty.gtI dont think translink has a mandate to make Vancouver proper a Megacity which sucks all the life out of its suburbsCan you elaborate? I think terrible commute from the suburbs sucks the life out of the people who live there. They spend  hours in traffic every day. Thats about  of their waking life. They could be using that time to spend with their family the people they love doing things they want to do like their hobbies or learning. They could be exercising and reduce healthcare burden on the state.

I recommend that you contact your HR and ask them about coverage. Also if you are going to school Universities almost always have counseling resources for students.

I leave that to others because nothing good can come of this.As for your other questions.Alcohol is controlled by the Province with some private liquor stores out there that sell as well though if youre curious about the pricing you can use the Government website to get an idea as to what your favourite beverage will cost you here note that in bars  restaurants therell be the obvious markup.Grociery prices seem to be in line with the rest of Canada so depending on season and exchange rate with the US. There will always be places you pay more e.g. Safeway and places you pay less e.g. No Frills though pick and choose is always a good idea. Prices can vary widely. Example recently was some over the counter medication.  at Shoppers Drugmart . at London Drugs or . at Costco. Same brand  product.Utilities are done by BC Hydro. How much you pay depends on how much you use. If your place has electric heating expect to pay a lot. My personal bill runs around month but heat is included in my rent so I dont have to worry about that.Hope that was a little bit of help.Cheers.,vancouver,cn9cj9p,9,t5_2qhov

Best place to see them is probably off those islands at the mouth of the river in Richmond also probably a better place to look for beaver than Stanley Park but Ive actually only seen them further up the river.

Were close to asia and easier to immigrate to than the USA thats basically what it comes down to.

2990061,0,t1_co698ps,gtPeople here take transit because they want to gosh darnit.Transit isnt just some fun tourist thing you know. People take transit because its cheap and its a fairly convenient way of getting around town. I was just proposing that we should largely discourage people derping alone across town in an empty car for a short trip This takes up so much of the road meanwhile the buses are sardine cans. Obviously some people need to drive cars for business mobility etc but we should convert the nonessential inefficient users of the road into other more efficient more sustainable users if were actually trying to actually improve the overcrowding.

3002937,0,t1_co93owi,Yes Im treating that as equal because thats the most logical assumption. I am not in any way denying that some routes are more economical to run than others. Ill note that those busses that are fully loaded etc. still only count as  service hour even when they cost substantially more to provide that hour.The cost per boarded passenger also doesnt reflect how much they paid. In the suburbs if each boarded passenger is paying . for a  zone single trip fare and in the B line the passenger is paying  because theyre using a upass which is essentially free then there is actually a loss per passenger. Since you dont have that data and neither do I its based on assumptions. While I assume we would agree that on those extreme cases that the likelihood is that the high efficiency routes are not actually losing money and that the worst cost ones likely are its not as if its  as simple as hey one is cheaper per boarder. Also smaller local transit is much cheaper to operate being driven by drivers with less experience and cheaper need less fuel much cheaper to purchase etc. So far there arent any variables that youve provided that suggest that Vancouver should have such a hugely disproportionately beneficial net taxation subsidy.Also please keep in mind this is only part of why Im voting no. Other reasons include. I do not want another tax it complicates my life it complicates the system of taxation more taxes to collect is inefficient and it suggests that we should just have special purpose taxes for each societal benefit.. I believe that the tax burden as a figure of dollars per tax payer is already either appropriate or too high but I lean towards appropriate.. If this is specific to capital projects I want a guarantee and plan on delivering those and a sunset of the tax.. There is no language anywhere that Ive seen that suggests they cant raise this from . to  at their own discretion or at least without taking it to a vote. The suburbs deserve the same treatment. I believe the most fair way of providing this would be to have a single fare zone. While I know that this vote isnt how better should translink be organized it doesnt matter. I dont believe perpetuating the current model is in our best interest and voting Yes unequivocally ties us to translink. It is as good a vote of confidence in translink as were ever going to have.,vancouver,co993i8,1,t5_2qhov

Whenever a full bus goes by or one arrives late its easy to say Well if they did it THIS way it would make everything better but really it may only make things better for YOU. I dont mean to sound harsh but the scheduling is designed to benefit as many people as possible so if  people are trying to use the same bus as you at the same time its going to be slow and you cannot blame the transit system.  Leave earlier in the morning to assume you will miss the bus so if it happens the next one will still get you to work on time.

3027567,0,t1_cobnd44,As much as I disagree with thedarkeside on LRT hes not wrong about lanes.  In so far as free road capacity exists people will use it.  To the extent that they dont they wont.  If Broadway were reduced to two lanes fewer people would drive.  If fewer people are driving much less can drive then congestion in the places theyre trying to go would be lower as well. Its the reverse of the induced demand observation that happens with new road capacity. If we made broadway a sixlane boulevard it would be congested as traffic adapted to use it.  If we take away the lane space well induce less demand for road.  Thats why Im suspicious about the transitcongestion claims. Its effectively creating road capacity when drivers take transit and thus inducing demand. Sure traffic will go down for a few years but the increased speed ease and convenience of driving will draw more traffic eventually.  If we want to truly deal with congestion we need road pricing in combination with mass transit to both reduce the subsidies to drivers accurately price the limited commodity that is space on the road and build a more livable walkable and accessible city,vancouver,cobszzo,1,t5_2qhov

Remember that the provincial government forced them to switch the Evergreen Line to Skytrain and forced them to implement the Compass Card program. Consider that one of the reasons Translink didnt want to do those projects is could be because they knew they couldnt afford it.You say oh but the Pattullo will be replaced and the Surrey LRT will happen anyway? Prove it. Theres no guarantee for the Pattullo though I realize Surrey plans to do the LRT regardless. Okay thats one project out of several planned. It doesnt include the hundreds of new buses Translink needs to maintain current bus service levels you know so you dont get passed up by three or four full buses during rush hour and to expand bus service.

An unreasonable toll would merely push the congestion problem onto Ironworkers and Seabus.Impose an unreasonable toll on Ironworkers in the name of decongestion and the North Shore will turn into an economic wasteland.People who live on the North Shore need to cross the inlet for work education healthcare shopping and recreational purposes. These needsand the congestion they createwont go away unless tolls are so high that north shore residents cant afford to make regular crossings.Seems to me that the effect of the Mayors policy is to solve the City of Vancouvers congestion problem by excluding people who live in other parts of the region.Whatever happened to the notion of building infrastructure to cope with the population we have?,vancouver,cp5jzta,6,t5_2qhov

3473686,1,t3_3010m6,What an odd post. The link between opposition to pipelines and a no vote in the plebiscite is well creative but bizarre.First of all pipelines are so last year. The tar sands projects are blowing away in the oil price crash hurricane. At these prices it makes no financial sense to start any new bitumen projects. Oh but the prices will eventually go back up again I keep hearing. No theres a very good chance that they wont other than short upward spikes. Demand for expensive oil has been thoroughly crushed by deteriorating economic conditions caused by that expensive oil. Expect low prices for years.Secondly even if it was still profitable to pump tarry goo to our shores fuck that. Comparing a truck spill or a train spill to a pipeline spill in a remote location thats part of enormous watershed is silly. Beyond that transporting dilbit by ship anywhere along our coast is playing with matches. A dilbit spill at sea cant be cleaned up.And then what does opposition to pipelines have to do with a no vote in the plebiscite? Im opposed to pipelines because of the massive risk they pose to our environment and Im voting yes to make more efficient use of our resources for transportation help protect the environment make life more livable for our citizens and to cut down on taxes in the long run.,vancouver,cpo84xv,3,t5_2qhov

If everyone is obeying the law and going the posted limit then it is more efficient to use both lanes. I would be fine with a law that provided that anyone going less than the posted limit had to stick to the right lane though. Speeding isnt up to the individual its up to the state just like any other law. The Motor Vehicle Act is very clear that a person must not drive or operate a motor vehicle on a highway at a greater rate of speed than the posted limit.

Most countries maintain some form of investment visa where if somebody can invest a certain amount of money in your country property usually counts as an investment then you can get a free pass into the country. These visas exist because it is assumed that somebody investing enough money in your economy will be a benefit for the country. Unfortunately most of these visas across the world are abused by people who dump large amounts of shady money in the property market as a relatively riskfree investment while claiming to maintain residency to avoid the taxes and other bureaucratic crap that goes along with foreign ownership. The short version is that these new rules are meant to deter that kind of thing from happening. Learn English or French. Get audited by a Canadianapproved agency. If you have more than  million invest  million in a governmentrun fund that makes risky investments in Canadian businesses. If you dont like those rules then you arent allowed to get an investment visa.There are still arguments to be made regarding the actual benefit of investment visas but at least these new rules will guarantee that the individuals coming in are actually halfdecent people who seem partially interested in Canada and the local economy.,vancouver,cql5uk4,2,t5_2qhov

3820134,0,t3_341h82,If youre going to be renting out a suite particularly if its an owned apartment unit or a basement suite its absolute ludicrous to think that you shouldnt have to put a decent amount of time into vetting the applicants. Asking whether or not they have pets and thinking that would be an accurate measure of their ability to treat the place they live with respect is insane.The pet owners I know are by and large MORE responsible than the nonpet owners. It goes part and parcel with TAKING ON ANOTHER LIFE TO TAKE CARE OF.Any rescue organization such as VOKRA screens applicants excessively. If youre adopting from a reputable breeder the same sort of vetting takes place. So why are landlords who have properties that in this city could cost upwards of a million dollars thinking that it makes MORE sense to take on tenants with LESS responsibilities?Bottom line if youve invested in a property it should be a priority of YOURS to make sure that the PERSON living in that space is trustworthy responsible and reliable.

The land upon which they sit is valuable.  But there is plenty of room to bring more housing more affordably to more people by allowing the construction of more apartment blocks townhomes and other denser units.

At that time langara only offered st year engineering. They cant really do nd year since they dont have the lab equipment and not many of the courses. I definitely recommend doing first year engineering at langara. Teachers at college are hired to teach at university they are hired to do research. Plus getting help from an instructor or ta is way easier at langara then at  Ubc.One thing in case you were not aware since you already have a degree you can get a comp sci degree from ubc in  years.

3976723,1,t3_3603br,Good talk to Christy about raising taxes.Ill say it again you can have one domicile. If you have properties spread out amongst multiple names holding companies family members etc you cant classify it your domicile. Doing so results in forfeiture. Any property that is classified nondomicile has x property taxes the first year goes up x the next year and so on and so forth. Nonpayment of property taxes after  years means the city can seize the property. If you rent the property out at  below market rates you pay only the existing tax of a domicile. Anything above it and you pay x property tax. All extra tax revenue will go to housing subsidies that are needsbased. Nothing else.,vancouver,cr9kw9h,3,t5_2qhov

Housing follows supply and demand just like everything else and anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot.No density in my overprice single family dwelling zoned neighbourhood!!!! And My kids cant afford to live near me!!! are not complaints that people get to make at the same time. To add to that even if it did look likely to bust the government would step in to stop it. Either by constricting supply further decreasing lending rates giving tax incentives or some other economic means. A housing crash is like a movie bar fight.

Cameras have limited dynamic range which means that they cant make out the details in the shadows and in the bright clouds as well as our own eyes.  HDR is a technique where you take multiple photos and then blend them in a way to create a photo that feels more realistic.  It can also be used to create photos that look unrealistic as in your case  sometimes that is done intentionally as an artistic effect and sometimes it is done unintentionally.  Would you mind posting the series of pictures that you started with before you made this HDR image or was it done incamera or inphone?,vancouver,crh5o03,4,t5_2qhov

But valued it at a dollar based off the costs of creating the park and any costs for development of the green spaces and environmental needs associated with the soil. But they have done ZERO work on this.So it cant be both ways. They shouldnt be allowed to take the costs of doing the work on the land off the land value if they arent actually going to do any of the work.

You would need to be making nearly  times the median income AND with a partner who also makes  times the median income in order to barely afford the absolute cheapest house in Vancouver.  The rule of thumb used to be you shouldnt purchase a home that costs more than x your annual income.  Nowadays that rule isnt always strictly followed but there are some other good guidelines you can use.Gross Debt Service GDS Ratio. No more than  to  of your gross annual income should go to mortgage expensesprincipal interest property taxes and heating costs plus fees for condominium maintenance.All of this is on top of this couple having the down payment for a home in the KMillion range.

A lot of the older buildings in the West End Kits and South Granville dont advertise on craigslist  padmapper etc.  My only advice would be walk around the neighborhood that you want to rent in.  Many managers for the older buildings just put a sign out on the front lawn.  Ive had many instances where Ive seen the sign called the number and with the manager being onsite much of the time I could look at the place right then and there.I have never rented in someones basement suite too many horror stories for me so that may not be an option if you are looking for that type of situation.,vancouver,csj5qt0,6,t5_2qhov

The only difference in shops is the number of vendors is larger in the newer market compared to the older one. When it comes to food they both have a wide variety but obviously the new night market New one is the one you pay for old one is free has more selection. That said many things at the new night market have lines and you can end up stuck in a line for quite a while sometimes.If you are bringing people from away and just want the culture shock value of a Vancouver night market take them to the newer larger one.

Im not sure how that changes when the training is proprietary and provided by the employer.Mandatory training programs funded by the employees are allowed I believe.   For example see what Rouge is doing  which I believe is further complicated by the fact that the company paid for training and the employees paid for incidentals.Your case is a further grey zone because they are asking her to do the training tasks at their place of employment.  If it is unpaid training then does the companys insurance policy apply?  What happens if she stabs someone in the eye accidentally  can they sue the company.. or do they go after your gf since she was not acting as an employee at that time.Long story short  I dont know of a black and white law that makes this illegal and I think it would take a court case to sort it out.

The sign in the post says Dear Vegetarians if you are trying to save the animals why are you eating their food?To apply this to homosexuals the sign must read something like this Dear gay guys if you dont like pussy why do you always act like one?In  it is not acceptable to poke fun at gay people or minorities.

4704039,0,t3_3fc3v2, Im on the month plan.  I routinely travel around Vancouvernot DTBurnabyRichmondCoquitlam. In those areas I have not gone out of their home network.  I occasionally travel around Surrey when visiting friends. Sometimes I move out of the home network but for the most part I havent had any issue.  Winds data network is not as fast as the big . Its still using G where the others have moved to LTE. For my data usage its entirely acceptable Im normally connected to WiFi when I use data. When Im out and about Im using google maps streaming music sending messages through Google Hangouts occasionally using Chrome or Im checking reddit.  The speed of their network has not negatively impacted those usages sometimes a reddit link will take a bit longer to load Im patient I can wait an extra  seconds here and there. I recently travelled to the southern gulf islands and switched on data roaming for the first time. I used it for  days of fairly regular use. My bill was an extra . Im saving month from my previous bill and Ive been using Wind for  months thats  in savings. Im perfectly happy to occasionally pay extra when I need to use data roaming. Like others have suggested you should buy a sim and test it out in your area. I havent travelled to Langley so I cant say what the coverage is like there. Also unless someone tells you when they first signed up to Wind you should take their complaints with a grain of salt. When Wind first launched it was plagued with poor service and I wouldnt touch it with a ten foot pole. Its gotten noticeably better over the years hence why Ive finally made the switch. Many people who first tried it got burned and now in their eyes its complete garbage and not worth a second thought.,vancouver,ctnhchv,2,t5_2qhov

Both stores price match. What I did is I just ordered my parts online then picked them up in store so I didnt have to pay shipping. For majority of the components Memory Express and NCIX had the same prices so I ordered majority from NCIX. I do prefer dealing with Memory Express though.

4924993,0,t1_cuf2mue,Sarc aside yes but not just because its a condo. The condo owners rent out their suites for more so the older apartments renovate suites once they empty and up the rent to an amount a few hundred lower than the condo suites. However the condo owners can only reach a rent rate that reflects the benefits of the neighbourhood theyre located in so a standalone condominium will only make a small dent in rental affordability. Make that condo mixeduse putting retail shops on the main level and the whole neighbourhood jumps even more. Increase the neighbourhoods population with enough highdensity mixeduse condominiums and you get more transit accessibility increasing the rent rate even more. Its not just the condo causing the increase nor do all condo types cause the same rent bump its that we gravitate toward the benefits that mixeduse condo developments bring both as purchasers and renters increasing demand in the neighbourhood and driving rent rates up. ,vancouver,cufc1h8,1,t5_2qhov

But when applied to greatly sped up video it fails to compensate for the wildly shaking motion.Hyperlapse reconstructs how a camera moves throughout a video as well as its distance and angle in relation to whats happening in each frame. Then it plots out a smoother camera path and stitches pixels from multiple video frames to rebuild the scene and expand the field of view.  In other words it actually reconstructs the entire environment in D from the input video then plots a smooth camera path along the same lines as the input video.

5242214,1,t3_3mo7i8,I am the owner and the mean person that spoke to u outside the cafe ! There are always  sides to every story ! So I will now tell it as it really happened .  I was the crepe chef on Sunday and the first time I saw ur group was when I saw a young woman standing waiting for a washroom as the female washroom was occupied . I politely told her she could use the other washroom as they were both the same as I was running upstairs to press play On my way! the CD player . When I returned to the crepe station I then saw  men sitting on the bar stools at the front entrance ..just sitting looked like u were just waiting for someone . I had no idea who u were yet wondered why u were just sitting there . No menu in hand  no line up at the order counter and  staff members were behind the service counter not serving any patrons . Then I see both women exit the bathrooms and signal u both to come look at the bathrooms which u both did . Remember here at least  mins have passed ..no conversation with myself nor any staff members . The  of u then walked passed me and headed straight towards the front near the exit door . One of the staff did  ask if she could help u and there was a response of no thank u or something similar I could not hear as I was too far to hear what exactly what was said . I looked at the staff service lady and she just shrugged her shoulders at me as if to say  I dont know what they wanted . Once u left the cafe I asked both girls why they left and both girls said to me  they didnt say anything they were just looking around and then sat at the stools and waited for the ladies to finish in the bathrooms . Now hence u saying anything at all to us about a celiac disease ur wife had ....is a blatant lie! In fact the one staff member said she heard ur daughter say to Im guessing her mother  u cant go use the washroom !  Now yes I figured that they came in to use the washrooms as it is an ongoing situation we have happen in the cafe ..we see it daily . I went outside and very nicely said to the lady who was standing at the front of the door  in future so u know that we do not have public washrooms as our washrooms are for the cafe guests . I was polite I was not rude I simply let her know we do not have public washrooms .  At no time did u or anyone in ur group mention to any staff anything about celiac disease ...  I was followed back into my cafe by u and u approached me at the crepe station ! I was not and am not looking for an argument ...Im just telling it as I saw it . Sorry it was a horrible experience for u . ,vancouver,cvhvka1,-2,t5_2qhov

Just search the vancouver hashtag on Instagram and youll see that people from all over the Lower Mainland use Instagram and hike and live in condos have luxury goods etc.I do believe social media specifically Instagram has contributed to the rise of popularity in hiking and especially specific hiking trails Sea to Summit Garibaldi Lake Stawamus Chief being the most popular. The issue is when people want to see that same view and have that experience but dont do any more specific research on the trails. Ive directed quite a number of coworkers and friends to  so they can read the basic details length of the trail difficulty level and directions but also to read the reviews to see if anyone has updated the conditions and many of them did not know the site even existed. ,vancouver,cvquipy,2,t5_2qhov

It is not a major inconvenience to buy a  hat and wear it for your own safety. Why is it unfair to have people unwilling to take this basic step accept the natural consequences of their actions when accidents arise?There was no workplace hazard here. No one is psychologically out of their faculties or chemically addicted to a lack of helmet. It is easy wear the hat or not and in case of head injury the costs are  or egregiously high. Since it is a violation of the law to have been without a helmet anyway why is it a problem to make the law violator foot the bill for their own reckless behaviour?

5637010,0,t1_cwvspbb,This doesnt seem like a realistic solution at all. Im a transplant there were very few opportunities where I came from in Saskatchewan unless I wanted to be a farmer  but the weather was very hard on me. I would get really bad eczema in the winter and hay fever in the summer. Life was pretty much hell. Pretty much the only thing that Im good at and enjoyed is music. Making it as a musician in a rural area is basically impossible so I decided if I have to move to a populated urban center it might as well be Vancouver since the weather would be a lot kinder to me. And it was my eczema pretty much went away and my allergies cleared up as well. I can actually go outside here and enjoy myself. So thats why I pay the extra money to live here. Ive been here for  years now and its been difficult when you dont have much of a social network. I think people that grew up here take that simple thing for granted to a large degree. Its much easier to get work and find opportunities when youre entrenched in a community. Its hard being an outsider and starting from scratch. And going back home or moving out to somewhere like Chilliwack isnt really an option right now either. I would have to start all over again building relationships and I cant afford a vehicle right now so Im pretty much married to public transit for working. Who knows maybe I should have  just stayed in Saskatchewan and gotten a job locally and did my thing. But I know I wouldnt have been happy there.  My parents have moved away from there now too so I dont have much of a social net there as I did when I was younger. Ive wanted to live in Vancouver since I was  years old and Ive never really regretted moving. Ive met a lot of cool people here including my girlfriend and Ive had a lot of great experiences here and theres honestly no other place on Earth that I really want to live. Its hard sometimes but its been worth it.Im not trying to sound like a sob story either I really like my life despite some faulty decision making from time to time. I try to make sure I pay my share living here but sometimes life isnt as easy as we would hope.

Then when you went to sell it youd be looking at another k plus in agent commission plus other fees. That means that if the market doesnt appreciate doesnt fall either just stays flat your k down payment will net you a return of... Negative k! Not to mention your  a month mortgage payments.

5890618,0,t1_cxrqyn8,To clarify a few things first of all we definitely have the right to freedom of expression here in Canada hurray!. However that right is subject to the reasonable limits clause of the Charter. Unlike the US all of our rights are not absolute. They can and are limited by our legislation all the time to achieve policy goals.For example hate speech is most definitely a crime in Canada sections  of the Criminal Code. Similarly the Westboro Baptist Church were banned from entering Canada. So much for free speech eh?Im not saying any of this is a good thing Im just saying this is the way things are. So if the Canadian government decided that Trump was a symbol of hatred and racism they may very well choose to limit free speech in this sort of situation.But the government likely wont get involved in this situation. Freedom of expression prevents the government from censoring people. It does not prevent individuals from censoring each other. This seems like a matter than will remain in the private sphere. The owners will have to decide whether or not the Trump name is an asset and in the meantime people from both sides will voice their opinions loud and clear.,vancouver,cxrslnm,13,t5_2qhov

Stratas are crazy and can add new rules like no smoking inside your own unit or no renters and you are powerless. The city is almost crazier than the strata  making up new rules about your ablity to evict tenants above and beyond the already solid protection from the RTB and even making it illegal to cut down a tree on your own yard.   Listen man.. if you cant even do some landscaping on your land are you sure you really own it? Annual increases in mortgage interest rates and taxes are uncapped.,vancouver,cxv12qi,1,t5_2qhov

I gave Calgary a shot for a couple of years and had a great time but missed my home on the coast.I was planning on coming back but ended up moving to the Island instead. Ive been here for a couple of years now and love it. Travel to Vancouver all the time to visit friends. There is actually a decent software industrystartup scene here.

And last I saw there were two or three spots available in the downstairs one.Car ownership is clearly dropping I would presume if we had selfdriving  shared cars there would probably be half of the current ones in the underground parking.

With that level of pollution it is almost impossible to have safe food.With broad scary statements like that Id assume the article writer is going for scary which Americans love over factual.Also we cant trust their garlic because their organic garlic might not be organic? Organic produce is already an incredible scam to get people to pay more for food so Im not really worried about if pretend organic food is slipping through.And we cant trust any exports from two entire countries because they use poop as fertilizer? Didnt a few people die last year in Canada from Listeria from a meat processing plant. Perhaps we should all avoid the entire Canadian beef industry because of it?

6128474,0,t1_cylzmgc,gt Funny how you brought up the case in the Richmond Strata even though it was one guys alleged claim which hasnt even been proved.Do you doubt that its true? When it was on the news one of the other strata members defended the choice.gtYou act like the immigrants in Richmond that open grocery shops restaurants and miscellaneous items are such bad people because they are frequented by people of the same ethnicity just like an European Sausage House would be frequented by Caucasians. No one here has claimed anything like this. No one here is calling them bad people. Power to them if they open up a Dim Sum restaurant where has anyone complained about this?. The point is that its isolationist to move to a country with no real interest in interacting with people from any culture but your own. I went to Bolivia last minute a couple summers ago on VACATION without knowing any Spanish and I felt guilty about that. The taxi driver from the airport to the bus station gave me shit about having no Spanish skills. It was stupid I would never do that again. I cant even imagine seeking Bolivian citizenship with the attitude Interacting with the majority population? Having a meaningful conversation with any of them? Eh not worth the effort.

Salaries are on average below the national standards and costs of living more than just housing is far higher.Vancouver is a great place if you are wellpaid and wellestablished.

6687880,0,t1_d0axyl9,Sounds like you have a very specific idea as to who should be able to profit from cannabis and its likely one I fundamentally disagree with. As I see it cannabis really is no different from craft beer and the burgeoning growler filling scene. Its a mild intoxicant with high demand from a recreational consumer who prefers to make smaller more frequent purchases from an establishment near to where they live. The only major difference is cannabis was outlawed due to racism and lobbying pressure from special interests with no grounding in actual science. No one is actual naive enough to believe that dispensaries are serving anything other than the recreational market. The medical thing is just a flimsy pretence to allow the market to fulfill consumer demand and sidestep the current unjust prohibition.In the end we have two choices we can either follow the modern craftbeer industries lead and have a craft industry with many small producers and distributors  retailers or as I assume youd prefer we can create a corporate oligopoly enforced through overlystringent regulations on production and distribution that only enriches a select cadre of insiders and cronies. I would much prefer the cannabis industry benefit the thousands of small scale local growers and retailers Not gangsters mind you theres a big distinction here who have fought prohibition for decades rather than a bunch of suitwearing corporate profitchasers who have done absolutely nothing to fight prohibition or promote the industry and only started caring once they caught the scent of profit in the winds like a pack of circling vultures. While I agree organized crime does profit off the current system the majority of dispensary owners are smallscale local entrepreneurs who are providing a product for which there is significant demand as well as creating jobs. Nothing any dispensary operator is doing is precluding anyone else from making any additional investments upstream and Its easy enough to prevent organized crime from profiting off the industry once proper regulations are in place but I dont think replacing the existing model with something that would offer far less customer choice and concentrate profits in the hands of a relative few corporate interests is the way forward.Maybe Im missing your point though. What are you actually proposing for how cannabis should be produced and distributed? ,vancouver,d0b32va,2,t5_2qhov

6775676,0,t3_48j1t3,How much do you want to pay for it?So lets just say it cost  to put one officer on the road.  Thats their salary benefits training the car uniform and administrative support staff.  But not realllly.... because you see the federal government has a buy  get the th one free deal.  Since the RCMP is the federal police force they deal with the federal laws too.  Not just the Criminal Code or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act but also things like the Excise Act The Aeronautics Act Fisheries Act Migratory Bird Ac and so on and so forth.  Even if the RCMP was not doing the municipal policing thing they would still do the federal and provincial policing thing.  Which has been given this  number.  Look at Surrey they just hired  more officers.  Now if youre a resident of Surrey you should be absolutely livid that your city let its police department run  officers short but thats a different issue.  Surrey hired  but is only paying for .  Saving about .  But in a department like Surrey where they have what  officers?  of them are being paid for by the federal government.  What savings are there?  Lets just round it off at  the city of Surrey saves by using the RCMP?  Where would that twelve million come from?Im sure that Burnaby and Coquitlam also know this.  Richmond? Theyre talking like theyre going to start their own force.  But it will costs them Millions of dollars extra to do so.  And why?  Richmond has said its not a service issue.  I bet the other cities agree the policing service they get is just fine and its a bargain.  So why want to switch again?IMO there are far better things cities can spend money on rather than starting a new municipal police force.,vancouver,d0kb1ek,2,t5_2qhov

Alot of people were not happy with the setup and I cant blame them. It takes a lot of people to run the festival I get it but small things like that make a world of difference when people are cold there is no where to warm up dry clothes or have a proper shower at the site. Especially when its been a torrential down pour for the last several days . The other security companies had slightly better set ups at different off site locations.  The only thing I liked was the reloadable bracelets MORE music festivals should do this including Sunfest where last year they changed it from the vendors taking money to taking only coupons bought at a separate both that was only open till maybe  or something to prevent the vendors from saying O I only made  when they made double or triple. That was a cluster fuck and the confusion was rampant as people did not know until they showed at site.

A lot of the enforcement that goes on in society isnt actually due to official enforcement rather its based on societal shaming. Nowadays were so scared of getting punched in the face or being insensitive that the social shaming isnt happening. So  recognizing that bus drivers cant enforce fares I do think there could be a way for drivers to apply gentle shaming to freeloaders without antagonizing the person enough for them to get violent. They still get a free ride but they also have to face the shaming. For really destitute people shaming doesnt matter and they will carry on. But for jerks that just dont want to pay maybe theyll think twice.Sorry  getting a bit dorky with the theory. This probably sounds ridiculous!,vancouver,d0mi4up,2,t5_2qhov

6974083,0,t3_4b5g48,Its wishful thinking that Vancouvers market will bust. A much more likely outcome in my opinion is flatlining with perhaps a modest declinerecovery cycle. Comparisons with the US housing market are unfounded. The US housing bubble was based on overbuilding. Developers were building entire communities in suburbs of cities like Phoenix Las Vegas and to a lesser degree even cities like Seattle. Investors bought these developments hoping they could flip them but the ponzi scheme eventually ended because the population literally couldnt support the supply. Vancouver is not overbuilding if anything its underbuilding given demand. The US vacancy rates were high during the boom. Aside from absentee owners who choose to leave their places empty Vancouvers housing market is pretty much at full capacity. A decline in prices has plenty of demand to buy into the market after even a modest decline. Lending is a lot tighter in Canada. Sure interest rates are low and people are extending themselves but most people have  year fixed mortgages. In the US they had exotic mortgages with clauses that in some cases tripled or quadrupled payments. If interest rates climb in Canada many people will still be able to afford the payments theyll just spend less which will hurt the Vancouver economy but not enough to destroy it. Besides Vancouvers economy despite gov propaganda isnt that strong anyway. GDP growth is entirely from housing and employment growth is mostly lowpaying parttime. Foreign buyers wont go away. The US housing boom was a domestic one. Vancouvers is not. Whether we like it or not Vancouver is now a bank account city. Unless laws seriously change to control foreign ownership and I dont think they ever will even a  or  decline off todays prices will attract buyers. Even if the Chinese economy tanks there is a bottomless pit of millionaire buyers.I would love it if Vancouver returned to what it was  years ago but I really dont think that will happen. Were past the point of no return in many ways. I dont love it but I think any hope for the future is in adjusting to the new normal. What we can do is ask for more supply better transit to spots outside the city and some modest restrictions on foreign investment outright bans simply wont happen... too many people will lose.,vancouver,d16ulmi,5,t5_2qhov

Municipal councils simply do not have the proper knowledge base or wisdom to make such choices nor do they have the ability to evaluate the true effectiveness of such policies.

Now its costing us several thousand dollars in moving costs as well as sunken costs like custom blinds we got for our old place that wont fit our new place. And the new house we got in Coquitlam may or may not be flipped next year  it is owned by a Vietnamese investor who lives in Vietnam and may or may not be coming back here next year may or may not be moving into the house himself or renting it out and may or may not choose to rent it out to a business it is doublezoned as a commercial property. I just had to pony up  grand in deposits and first months rent AND we are paying for two places this month because we couldnt take the gamble and keep looking after having  people show up at every showing we went to.

My brother and his wife paid half a million for their small  bedroom condo  years ago and it would sell for  now. Its cheaper in Burnaby and other outlying areas but its still not cheap. So if owning your own home is important to you you will need to have very high earnings.Also people in this city take a long time to warm up to new residents. I moved here from another Canadian city and found that people were not nearly as welcoming to strangers as they were in my old city. If that doesnt faze you and youre very social you could make friends a lot faster than me but it took me a couple of years to make new friends here. Im just saying if you get here and people seem cold its them not you and Im sure youll find your new people soon enough.This area has lots of great outdoor stuff to do but the night life is tame compared to a lot of places which is why we are sometimes called No Fun City You can still see great bands go to a bar go dancing etc. but depending on what youre into you might be disappointed.BUT you can take a city bus to the beach and maybe see a whale while kayaking there so its not all bad I dont regret moving there are a lot of great things about living here.

The restrictions are too much the personal cost to them too great. They must complete a strenuous lengthy recertification process demonstrate better English skills than most native speakers and pay through their nose. If they complete all this they are still not allowed to work in their specialisation instead they start from the bottom of the pile again. This is criminal we have taken some of the brightest best medical professionals from Iran and we are in danger of wasting all their knowledge and skill.

Cutting unneeded spending is good including cutting programs which no longer have value to students. If the ministry was smart with its spending the massive deficit wouldnt have come up. However it did and we need to deal with the problem with the future in mind. The other vital resources which are being threatened right now that will put many programs at risk special and gifted education being some of these programs. A lot of schools are facing the possibility of cutting parts of music programs which are currently used by the majority of students.

Nothing more than growing older like every other woman is left in my future. There is nothing in that flag or trans flag for me. I feel like an intruder and outsider at those events. However Do I want struggling trans people silenced? Do I feel Im better than any other person out there? Heavens NO. All the power to them but my help outside my public vote is over. Being an out LGBT advocate years ago cost me my career all while I tried to pay for expensive surgeries all while trying to do the right thing. Hate crimes survivor and Human rights complaints do not pay the bills. A shut mouth on your past deny being LGBT at all and wow you can rebuild your life really quick. Its the way life today is. Being out as trans makes most anyone I have met uncomfortable. For me its like going around to everyone I meet bragging about my highschool sports accolades.  Youd look like a moron! A male body person died my friends family and I cried for him. Some have joined me to celebrate a new life that was born out of that. Some never will. I am focused on today my future and it is brighter than I could have thought possible. I have fixed my life and lived past what this transition stuff was. Transition was a process an accomplishment.

Will they target Chinese only or any Chinese looking people?I mean I honestly dont think your coworker or anyone can always tell the difference? What if they turn up to be from Tibet or Taiwan would they get a pass? what if the target turns out to be a local citizen. Will you ask them to show their drivers or ID or proof of? Or will your coworkers move on to the tax evasion accusations? I understand they exist but how does your coworker determine that he has caught the Chinese that do it?  Can you give an example of what they mean by confronting them in such a way so that theyd feel uncomfortable and leave the city. Does your coworker understands the difference between pranks and physical violence? Do you think he is just venting or just trying to make a Four lions Vancouver edition? Serious followup if this was a reality would you report your coworker? How will they minimize any collateral damage to other Asians they target? How will they verify that they are home owners?

She and her parents were Gaelic speakers products of a history extending back to the medieval Viking raids. I suddenly realized that that is Trumps style. Hes not a tribal Highlander celebrated in Scotlands long battle for independence from England but a Viking slashing burning and laughing at the carnage in his wake. Think Kirk Douglas flashing his steely smile in the  Hollywood epic The Vikings.

July would be a good bet for when we see some further action  summer is nonpolitical people are happy and dont pay much attention to the news. It would also be the oneyear anniversary of the temporary restrictions imposed last July  and the anticipated end of those restrictions. Dont expect massive headlines. Nobody wants to destroy the real estate market so no press release will say thousands of properties held under moneylaundering treatyBeijing doesnt want to own Vancouver real estate Id expect that theyd offer a get out of jail free card to most people caught up in this  if youve taken M out of China illegally maybe you pay .M penalty and you dont have to go back to face charges. If youre a successful businessman maybe you pay  and thats it. Beijing needs to shut the door  they want this money back in the domestic stock market. Anything above that is free money. In the longer term this does solve the housing crisis. As it stands theres no Canadian politician who could say hey Ill cut real estate values in half and hope to have a future  theyd destroy whatever party they belonged to.

Some highlights.gt If road pricing goes ahead the mayors would consider reducing fees such as gas taxes.I believe that was in the Mayors plan last year.gt  the Ecofiscal study that Metro could look at distancebased pricing which is seen as the most equitable form of mobility pricing because each driver pays for the time and use on the roads no matter where they live. He estimates this would cost upwards of  billion to put into place Distancebased seems fair to me but Im not pleased about the price tag.gt TransLink CEO Kevin Desmond said last month that Metro would have to ensure there are strong privacy protections in place if they went ahead with distancebased pricingGlad to hear about privacy.gt right now all bridges south of the Fraser are tolled putting undue hardship on those residents.I agree though its not a problem for me personally I seldom cross the Fraser. But I dont think tolls should be removed from that outlandishly expensive bridge. I think its more reasonable to add them elsewhere.gt  Linda Hepner suggested Metro has an advantage in mobility pricing by having single insurance agency which could ask people to sign up for a pilot project to collect travel data.  The article mentions pilots like this have been tried elsewhere.gt some cities offer payasyoudrive insurance. This means the more people drive the more they pay while those who dont use their cars as much will get a break.Nice and it makes sense the less you drive the lower the risk of a collision.,vancouver,d3sgsjd,2,t5_2qhov

If you want under  my advice is to buy an off the rack suit from a reputable brand which youll be able to find at the Bay or Nordstroms that fits well around the shoulders and then get it tailored. If youre looking to spend around  I strongly recommend Harry Rosens Made to Measure suits which start around  plus whatever aesthetic changes you want to make. More than that I would recommend going bespoke which is a true custom as in constructed from scratch. In that case i would recommend Savile Row Tailors. Dont use indochino its way too risky.

7886254,0,t3_4n875m,The reason why values for townhomes everywhere in the Lower Mainland are going skyhigh right now is because they are next bestthing to a single family home. They have front doors they often have garages and they have small yard spaces. These are things that condos do not have but which are appealing to a certain type of buyer e.g. a young couple with kids or a retired couple who wants the feeling of a house without the maintenance. For these reasons I think a townhouse regardless of where it is in the Lower Mainland will retain its value better than a condo. Young people are pissed off about the housing market but the desire to settle down and have families is still strong. The supply of rental housing for single or young couples will always be ample but familyfriendly rental housing e.g. a selfcontained legal dwelling is harder to come by unless you get on the waiting list for a coop. You should still be strategic about what you buy  make sure the contingency fund of the complex youre buying into is healthy get an end unit if you can check that the garage andor yard space is part of the strata lot rather than common property make sure you have driveway parking etc.As others have said stress test your finances using a mortgage calculator. Assume that interest rates will rise by  in  years. Get life insurance now if you dont already have it year term K each topup your disability coverage if you need to and see if you qualify for critical illness. If you can disaster proof your finances and can pass the other stress tests then proceed.

7985798,0,t1_d4dli0n,The fact of the matter is that there is a hierarchy of right of way pedestrians gt bicycles gt motor vehicles. I do understand that cyclists arent supposed to pass on the right but the fact is that cyclists are going to share the road and sometimes use roads without bike lanes.I cant imagine youd be more satisfied with cyclists taking up the centre of the lane keeping you behind them all the time so youll have to accept that the ebb and flow of traffic will have cyclists passing cars and vice versa. Regardless of the legality of cyclists passing on the right its our duty as a motorists to yield to cyclists and pedestrians at all times except when it isnt safe or impossible to do so. Cyclists must always yield to pedestrians. All road users and pedestrians are supposed to obey the rules of the roads and the laws but sadly few can say they adhere to all of them all of the time. So as drivers its extremely important we err on the side of caution. This means shoulder checks before right turns and having to yield when cyclists are on our right.If people dont want to do these things sooner or later they will hurt or kill someone. I get its an inconvenience and annoyance for drivers but the alternative is something that could haunt us for the rest of our lives.As both a cyclist and a driver I see both camps acting like shitheads all the time. I try to use the road safely no matter how Im travelling so for me that means a lot of the time Im hyper aware of cyclists and err far on the side of caution because I know that the majority of humans are idiots with barely any regards for themselves let alone other people. It also means that Im constantly dodging pedestrians on bike routes because these people are fucking oblivious.

I would consider only going as far south as Florence or perhaps a bit farther. Spend time exploring. Cali might be a bit too far to truly enjoy. You might be on the road more than anything. Oregon has no state tax so you make up a bit on the exchange. Downside is the exchange but gas will still be cheaper than here and as mentioned no ferry  savings right there.Island  Ferry costs and line ups are a downer. Once over there Tofino is gorgeous. Nothing past there really. But you could head back to Hwy  and go north to Comox Cumberland and Campbell River. Lots of great ocean spots Like Oregon.Northern BC.  In  days its a stretch to go to the Yukon and back I think. but you could try. I prefer the ocean in the summer because of heat. Its a natural air conditioner. Okanagan is gorgeous. Have you thought of doing Grand Forks Christina Lake then crossing south to Spokane then maybe to Coeur DeLaine Idaho? Thats a nice drive and there is a cool little amusement park in Coeur DeLaine called Silverwood. Camping is plentiful in the surrounding area. Lots to explore. Thats my  cents.

If you think more like an engineer BCIT is the way to go.Also if you take the BCIT CIS diploma almost all courses will give you transfer credit to UBC or other unis.  This way you get the practical aspect from the diploma and the theoryresearch from UBC.BCIT also has a ? month programming specific certification.  It covers fullstack web dev and your choice of several programming languages and software engineering.  If you really want to get into serious programming a strong math background certainly wont hurt either.Optionally KPU has an equivalent to BCITs CIS diploma and Btech.  KPUs program is more a standard uni model where you pick and choose each class for each semester BCIT is a cohort model where you are with the same  students the whole program monfri  with everything programmed for you.  BCITs biggest advantage is networking they provide more opportunities than any other program in the lower mainland to meet and greet those in the industry.  However only the very top students are offered the coop option and this is a big deal as competition is tight.  KPUs coop option is much easier to get in so this is something to consider.  KPUs lectures are all predominantly  hours once per week while thats a long time to focus it allows a lot more time out of class to study work on assignments take extracurricular certifications get ITIL BTW and work.Douglas college also offers a good diploma but they are not on a semester calendar.

Doesnt seem like NIMBYs since they want to have low income housing and not expensive condos. Unlike the Commercial drive residents who complain about towers ruining their view I dont think thats the angle of the people opposing this who are more low income advocates than homeowners.That spot is a parking lot now so not exactly a valuable thing needing preservation. I can see the argument about it being beside Sun Yat Sen garden but the other side of the garden already has a bunch of residential towers.

If you fail to note any deficiency or problem  a malicious landlord could claim that you caused that damage and can claim part or all of your damage deposit to correct it. That said most landlords around here are in fact good people this just isnt a risk I choose to take anymore. If your landlord doesnt do a Condition Inspection report with you first of all this could be a red flag that you have an absentee landlord but secondly it means the landlord cant claim your damage deposit to cover damages when you move out.Edit Links      ,vancouver,d5shrwt,1,t5_2qhov

Loudmouth failed to realize that the lady with the walker is a regular customer she and the driver know each other and she pulled up a bit further so she could let the lady board by the elevator at the back of the bus.Plus I just dont know how they handle how stupid bus passengers in this city can be.  Dont stand at the front of the bus move to the back.  Dont plant yourself in front of the door if youre not getting off at the next stop.  If you are young and able bodied and choose to sit in the priority seats for whatever reason for the love of god pay attention to who is getting on and dont just throw on your headphones and look at your phone and ignore everything.  Youre in a seat designated for people that need them.  Its unreal here.

I always tell the story of an old construction boss I had who took our crew to the soup kitchen because he was too cheap to buy us lunch. This isnt uncommon. The screening processes to decide who to allocate resources to used be very bad so you end up having people abuse the resources and ultimately take them away from people who actually need them.People like you are so caught up on being politically correct and having the best intentions  that you end up being blinded to the fact that there are a lot of crappy lazy people out there who have no issues using up these resources without really needing them.

We look forward to seeing you out at the event.We do realize that shutting down the QIIP program is a long shot but that doesnt mean we dont advocate for it.  We support the recent development announced by Quebec that they will be screening applicants more closely looking for indications that they are not planning on settling in Quebec.  For instance if an applicant already owns real estate in Vancouver their application will be rejected.  We think this is a step in the right direction.One additional idea weve considered asking for if a shutdown is off the table is that those QIIP immigrants that decide to live somewhere other than Quebec in the first  years not have theyre k investment returned to them.  This should provide some strong incentives for those immigrants that plan on not living in Quebec.As for your comment on requirements for having apartments with more bedrooms that locals can afford we absolutely agree.  There are way too few family friendly homes especially in the city of Vancouver.

8941443,0,t1_d7mklbu,If you arent in a rush that is great as it will take the pressure off. Dont try too much to time the market as no one really can do that and you could end up always waiting and regretting it I bought about  years ago and everyone told me to keep waiting. Im glad I didnt but it did mean ignoring real estate once I bought so that every dip and rise didnt get me going! If youve got a family then its a little harder as youll want a bigger place but if you are following the market you can get a sense of what is out there so you know when you find something that its the right one! We are only selling because we needed a bigger place baby! and ended up renting it out for a bit. We bought a townhouse in Langley commuting isnt for everyone and we ended up getting jobs out this way initially but because we looked at a bunch of townhouses put this way I had an idea what they were generally like what sucked about some and what was normal so when we saw this one we knew it was exactly what we wanted and had no hesitation. I think it must be hard when people cant do that research!Do you have a realtor I am not one! as they can set you up with an automatic email with anything in your criteria and any changes. So you can see how things are selling or not and how long they are on the market etc. As a buyer there is no cost so I say take advantage! There is also no obligation so while itd ideal that you trust your realtor you dont have to stick with them and a polite no thank you is all it takes. I had one realtor initially that rubbed me the wrong way Im glad I didnt stick it out with them. If you dont have a realtor and would like a recommendation just pm me. I really am liking my agent in Vancouver she is very much matter of fact and tells it like it is. I also had an amazing realtor in Langley that really knows the Fraser valley. Its good to have someone who knows the areas. He steered us clear of a couple of developments where he felt the build quality wasnt great. The other thing Id ask is if youve figured out how much youd be approved for and maybe gotten pre approved? You can lock in at a set interest rate for I think  months? No cost obviously and if rates drop you dont have to take it but if the rate increases youre locked in. Probably wouldnt see a huge increase but hey it could be a few bucks on the numbers we are talking about! A mortgage broker should also be willing to really answer questions. I think I drove mine batty! Again free service so use it to your advantage. lol Ive spent so much time trying to sort this all out for myself that Im probably just dumping information on you!!

8986463,0,t1_d7rvg14,Thats debatable. Even though someone is willing to pay a price at the time sometimes its because monetary policy has allowed too many people to over leverage themselves with debt. In that case they have literally spent money that doesnt exist and wont exist even by the time they have to pay it back. Banks can lend out more than they have and sometimes they misjudge on a grand scale the time it will take to pay it back vs. the lending they must make to stay solvent. In other words some would assign the notion of false value to an asset class that will soon swiftly correct in value because money doesnt actually have to exist immediately in order to buy something. ,vancouver,d7s19jk,1,t5_2qhov

I know he is nearing retirement I really hope that someone steps up to fill this gap when he does.If you do meet him I hope you have a chance to ask him about his thoughts on benzodiazpines and zdrugs.Id love the chance to meet him  hopefully some time in the future.  Maybe if I manage to book a public screening of the documentary As Prescribed when it comes out and assemble a panel of people with lived experience physicians and pharmacists.We had two trainee psychiatric nurses come out to our group a few months ago.  Was honoured to have them.  Word is getting out albeit slowly.For those of you who are interested here is a link to a trailer for Holly Hardmans As Prescribed documentary.

Thats coming this week but to answer some for you now gaiters  yes and also hiking and poles. we went pretty light to be honest if anything at all we took maybe too much food. My gf took a book which she didnt touch. Everything else we used! more plastic bags more chocolate didnt really stop for proper lunches but had mainly clif bars regular and protein variety and dried fruit and nuts to munch while walking. we went in the rd week of September late in the season. First two days were super sunny as you can see in the vids last  were more wet and overcast with sporadic rain. I would have preferred mid august but the weather is so changeable I think we got lucky with what we had!Thanks for watching and hit subscribe on the YouTube channel if you like and youll get an email when I put out the round up video later this week discussing campsites gear the whole experience etc,vancouver,d8xcebx,1,t5_2qhov

9338919,0,t3_58cibb,Funny they say Surreybased but use a picture of the Vancouver location. Theyve only moved to Surrey this year.The actual thing is its the end result of the mergers of three credit unions Pacific Coast Savings Richmond Savings and Surrey Metro Savings. Credit Unions in BC used to be part of Credit Union Central which is now Central  which merged with Ontario Credit unions. So what Coast Capital is doing seems like it wants to merge with yet more credit unions across the country and become a real threat to the big  banks. Right now they are only in Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island. Kelowna is the farthest location north and east of Metro Vancouver that Coast has. Vancity has locations much in the same place as Coast Capital Savings.Everyone needs to keep in mind that Canada has  National big banks that all HQ out of Toronto or Montreal that have almost no incentive to compete against each other and they should be scared of a credit union offering competitive banking services.Unlike the US where has no national banks. The largest US bank is barely in more than half the US states. Canadian banks are  of the  largest banks in the US. You can get free checking accounts from many banks in the US. None a single one in Canada. There is no reason for this.Id love to see Coast Capital expand because there is no reason for these banks and other credit unions to charge fees unless they are sitting on thousands of dollars. You only need one  share to have a Coast Capital account. It may not matter if Coast Capital has physical locations outside of BC if they can still operate like the onlineonly banks to the rest of the country.,vancouver,d8zry7a,4,t5_2qhov

Also competing with the rickshaw  Sbc  Astoria  pats pub  doesnt help.Edit.

9435598,0,t3_59vrkk,Well lets see. First there was the near tbone at Nanaimo and Hastings last night. Car crappy older car travelling west on Hastings decided red lights dont mean squat and proceeded through. Two cars white SUV first travelling south on Nanaimo were well into the intersection. That the crappy car didnt actually hit the white SUV was impressive tho the driver seemed a tad shocked as it took a while for him to maneuver out of the intersection while EVERYONE watched. Wasnt clear if contact had been made or not as the SUV followed the crappy car around the corner into the alleyway. Then there was this mornings commute. Going up Gaglardi from Broadway taking the curve and a car in the ouside lane decides the one in front is going too slowly so they put their signals on to move into the inside lane. But were at the main part of the curve going up and there is no space to merge  plus its a huge blindspot. But they wanted to merge so merge they do only to realize there is a car right beside them. That does not deter the driver  honking ensues and the driver shoves their way into the lane. Of course all these people are going to SFU and the car that almost got hit proceeds to follow the car that merged. Should have followed to see what happened. ,vancouver,d9c10ia,1,t5_2qhov

9453093,0,t1_d9dqz2b,No but its a legitimate way of trying to limit the impact of climate change and many researchers have examined it to try to make it realisticEven if people just had one child each it would make a huge impact. Not saying we can enforce it its an ethical mess for sure. We need way more family planning education and contraception availability in developing nations. But really its the children born in developed countries that leave the largest carbon footprint. A combination of having fewer children born in developed nations  renewable energy technologies eating less meat finding ways to reduce waste incentives for people to get things repaired instead of just throwing them away stopping companies from designing planned obsolescence into products and etc might be just enough to help. We have to hit the big companies too. For each individual to reduce their footprint is almost nothing when major industries like garment manufacturing produce so so so much more waste than even a small cities of citizens can reduce in their personal life.However having fewer children would definitely help as well. It would reduce quite a lot of resource use and not have another consumer in this world. Rieders audience seems to want an easier way. A student asks about the carbon savings from not eating meat.Excellent idea Rieder says. But no amount of conservation gives you a pass. Oregon State University researchers have calculated the savings from all kinds of conservation measures driving a hybrid driving less recycling using energyefficient appliances windows and light bulbs.For an American the total metric tons of carbon dioxide saved by all of those measures over an entire lifetime of  years . By contrast the metric tons saved when a person chooses to have one fewer child .,vancouver,d9e8vt7,0,t5_2qhov

The day after the concert. Id been waiting for a few hours but all the flights were packed. I finally decided to give up and go catch a ferry so I walked up the gangway and when I was halfway up to street level Cohen and his entourage squeezed down past me. I froze. I was raised on his music had seen him perform the night before the second time Id seen him on that tour and had had a crush on him forever. I stared said nothing but always regretted not propositioning him on that gangway. I know he would have said no as he had a float plane to catch but I think he would have appreciated my intentions and maybe Id have got a smile.I did talk briefly to Sharon Robinson a few minutes later when I passed her in the parking lot.

9618545,0,t3_5coet1,Vancouverites want city council to do more to end homelessness but Vancouverites protest and impede city council when city council tries to increase housing supports.Heres the thing. Tossing people into a home after theyve been living on the street often doesnt work well. Many people who are absolutely homeless i.e. literally living on the street and not couchsurfing or cycling through shortterm housing need to learn how to live in a home again. They dont trust an awful lot of service providers. They often have a lot of problems with addictions because guess what? Being homeless increases the likelihood of addiction. Its a way to cope with everything that goes along with not having a home and being treated like literal shit. But so many people assume that if you just throw people in any housingwhether its appropriate for the individual or notthey should be happy and grateful and live happily ever after and all of their problems will magically be cured. It doesnt work like that.Yesterday everyone was complaining about the situation in the West End. Ive seen a lot more problems lately Im also a bit unhappy with the situation. But many of those problems disappear when the temporary winter shelters open up. Yet every year people like RainCity Housing are dragged through public hearing after public hearing before they can even think about opening up.

9753618,1,t3_5ev4jz,As a Landlord I can recommend that you just tell the truth about having a new job and moving.  Most of the time we dont really mind that you have a life.  The only hiccup is we typically rely on the income being there for the length of the lease so your current landlord will most likely keep your security deposit.  I had a girl living in the unit I have for almost a year when she decided to move out early and get serious with her bf.  I was thrilled for her!  But she didnt get her deposit back.  I expected that income.  So be nice offer to leave the deposit and theyll probably let you out of the lease no trouble.  ,vancouver,dafcnjm,0,t5_2qhov

9754649,0,t1_dafgezi,gt I could be wrong but I believe you can go to the womens health hospital and get one?So first you need a prescription to get one. Many walk in clinic drs and family drs are reluctant to do this due to a variety of reasons outdated beliefs about how risky they are potential for heavier and more painful periods they can be incredibly painful to insert you need to reliably check the string each month etc. Then you need to get it inserted. You need to make an appointment with a clinic that will actually insert the IUD  not all clinics do this all require you book an appointment and many if not most are booked weeks or months in advance. When I got my first IUD about  years ago there was basically only one clinic that did IUD insertions  day a week in the evenings and  Sat a month. Now there are more hormonal IUDs have made IUDs more popular but its still a process some clinics require a consultation appointment separate from and prior to insertion. Add to all of this that most clinics recommend you get insertion while you are menstruating so there is a very small window of time to get the IUD inserted each month and coordinate an open appointment  assuming your menstruation is regular and predictable potentially not in a high risk lifestyle. I know a few women who described the insertion as the most painful thing theyve ever experienced. My first time was AWFUL. Like bawling my eyes out curled up in a ball for  hours awful and thats after very strong painkillers that the dr gave me. My second time was thankfully somehow not as bad but still quite terrible. I had to get my IUD replaced  years ago but was about to go on vacation  trying to find a clinic that had the IUDs in stock and could fit me in on very short notice took a day of calling clinics all over the lower mainland. It wasnt easy. For a copper IUD price is anywhere from  for hormonal its more like . Theres also the fact that for some women IUDs just dont work. Either too painful period is too heavy uterus is the wrong shape or tilt or if you are on the hormonal version the hormones just dont work with your body. TLDR... its a process. One that would be made so much more difficult for someone who has health issues cash flow issues access to information issues not to mention potentially no care card which would reduce the number of clinics she can access. ,vancouver,dafh95s,4,t5_2qhov

One of the key questions on any insurance application or renewal is Where is the vehicle usually parked? In both countries a false or misleading answer is grounds for outright cancellation and denial of a claim.

9826356,0,t1_daobebb,Just one more thing on thisgtSo they nailed the easy ones?Thats a complete misunderstanding of polling. On the most basic level it consists of asking people questions followed by trying to determine which of the people who answered are more likely to mean what theyre saying. The most basic way of doing that which works for most elections is by filtering out those who are less likely to vote in part because they havent voted in recent elections. The problem was that I and many others saw that there were people in the Midwest who have been abandoned by politicians for many cycles and the polling was calling them unlikely voters because they hadnt voted for anyone since Reagan despite the fact that they were much more enthusiastic voters than say the black urban voters who came out for Obama. The problem with the polling was that it failed in what I think was a very predictable way by overvaluing the response of those Obama voters who were unenthusiastic and undervaluing the Reagan voters who had stayed home for decades.,vancouver,daoe8n2,3,t5_2qhov

If you think being hungry is bad try being hungry while vomiting and shitting on the floor on Christmas alone when you dont even have  to buy Gravol and are too weak to drag yourself to the bathroom to puke in the toilet.Anyway my friend owns a chain of French bakeries and he used to donate to the food bank then got a letter saying they are worried about their customers cholesterol and they respectfully request he no longer donate his luxury products to them. If thats not a case of beggars being choosers then I dont know what is.

10130089,0,t3_5kznbt,A prudent move on BNS part. When I took out my first mortgage I was honest that K of my down payment was a loan from my brother that would have to be repaid over the next five years. It might have cost me one or two tenths of a point in added risk but the thing was if I got into cash flow trouble later and had to renegotiate the bank couldnt simply pull my mortgage for presenting them with a fraudulent set of books.According to CMHC by far the most popular mortgage product in the country is the fiveyear fixed. So for a typical Scotia applicant intending to use that instrument and taking the maximum allowable loan today .K it means that five years from now when they not only have to renew their mortgage at what will undoubtedly be significantly increased rates they will also have to start coming up with an additional  per month to begin paying down their MikeyMart loan a monthly nut they will be tied to for the next  years.This is a nearperfect way of ensuring that five years from now when prices have presumably declined somewhat certain homeowners will be stuck having to renew underwater mortgages at exactly the same time their mandatory loan repayments kick in further impinging on their cash flow and moving them even closer to the razor edge of financial viability than they are today. Some may end up having to sell their homes at a loss and become indebted to their bank for the price difference. What good is that going to do anyone?It would be wise for Scotia  as well as all the other Tier Ones  to filter these marginally qualified applicants out now while they are still a potential risk  rather than  years down the road when they have become an actual financial liability to their mortgagors.So in those terms the MikeyMart Loan is already a failed concept.,vancouver,dbryffc,12,t5_2qhov

10670846,0,t1_ddgjbe0,Show me a RCT that systematically asked the right questions. Last time you refed a nice metaanalysis in JAMA that is out of date. I am going by the literature. If there is not a study out there that asked the right questions to support your hypothesis then I would recommend that you see this study through to completion. Instead both metaanalysis and RCTs have failed to find a improvement in patient outcome. Done. Thats it. It doesnt matter what the big picture is. The issue here is that perhaps hip density in the context of supplementation is the wrong measure to be observing for clinically relevant outcomes. Paying too much attention to the big picture and not enough to the value of a test or a research study explains why in medicine we still employ useless physical tests that are no better than a coin flip. What I think you and most others fail to realize is the harm that the supposed value and credence supplementsvitaminsCAM lends to an improvement in patient care. As I have reiterated there are toxic and harmful side effects that stem from drug interactions and patients also develop a false sense of security that they are improving their health.As a fellow not sure what specialty maybe not involving patient care? you should recognize that someone who is looking for k IU tablets of Vit D is most definitely not pregnantbreastfeedingdeprived of Vit D. Thats the double head fake and beyond the crux of this argument. People who need to take vitamins are those that do not have computers dont know what vitamins are and most certainly are not looking for k IU. Furthermore my point about rickets is to highlight the notion that osteoporosis in Canada does not stem from inadequate Vit D levels as it does in developing countries  so you might as well assume rickets is a concern in this case. I may not be a fellow yet but as a resident I do have some limited clinical knowledge and having engaged in basic science for more time than I would have liked to complete my thesis I do have a good conceptual understanding about how to present opinions and interpret the literature. But thank you for your concern. Dogmatically clinicians invest too much opinion and emotion into the decisions and advice they provide and in my experience training at multiple centers across this country physicians would do well to invest more time into the literature. ,vancouver,ddgm7wn,1,t5_2qhov

If you had actually studied the Castro Revolution you would know this there is a reason CubanAmericans cheered the death of Fidel Castro and celebrated. These are people who risked their lives to come to America because Castros Regime brought such immeasurable misery to them that maybe dying trying to escape was far better than staying and suffering.     Fidel Castro brutally tortured and executed political opponents executing thousands by firing squad since .   Fidel Castro in an act of malevolence sank the  de Marzo tug killing Cuban Women and Children.   Fidel Castro ordered to shoot down American Civilian Aircrafts killing  people with many other near misses.   Fidel Castro sent any dissenters to Forced Labour Camps and once the dissenters were unable to work further he let them starve to death.   Fidel Castro repressed all expressions of Art Literature and Religion. To partake was Thought Crime.   Fidel Castro raided suspected dissenters homes without evidence breaking and destroying families.   Fidel Castros regime rounded up any who rejected Marxist Ideology and forced them to undergo reeducation which included hard labour forced malnourishment torture and execution.   Fidel Castro managed to turn the richest country in the Caribbean into a hellhole prison island that people attempted escapes on by makeshift rafts made of anything they could find into a literal OCEANSEA.   Fidel Castro enacted public education systems which taught fallacies and propaganda designed to keep the public uneducated and uninformed to reduce the chances of dissent.   Fidel Castros regime enacted a Free Healthcare System which was monitored by military personnel at all times any citizens family who needed medical assistance was put into Blood Debt with the regime and if at any time slavelike labour was required these Blood Debts would be called on.    Che Guevara Castros primary enforcer quoted as such  To send men to the firing squad judicial proof is unnecessary. These procedures are an archaic bourgeois detail. This is a revolution.

So its not about how many claims you have but when you have those claims in your driving history. Like with windshield claims you can have none for ten years have a couple in year due to bad luck and ICBC threatens to cut you off. Seems a little unfair.The real driving cost pun intended behind ICBCs financial woes are people who want a step up in lifestyle instead of just being made whole again.

Id be curious to hear.Its wellknown that the GVRD Valley and now Kelowna and Victoria are well into the point where detached homes and often even just condos are ludicrously expensive andor well outside the affordability index moving to another provinces major cities or moving to the states certainly happens enough for people from the GVRD who are in their s through s these days. Moving to a smaller city in BC also makes sense. However while I could understand people moving to affordable places like Nanaimo CourtenayComox Vernon and similar places    people how feasible is it for people to pick up and move to tiny towns like Powell River the one mentioned in the article? Can people really make a go of it in such a small place on average? Where does one get a job to pay for the house even if it is inexpensive? At least in places like Nanaimo or Vernon you have a reasonablysized population for sustaining a business or finding publicsector work and even if they lack the amenities of the GVRD you still can find a number of decent restaurants plentiful shopping and most or all of the things you might have had in the GVRD albeit somewhat less of it. How realistic is it though to pack up and go to a tiny town in the middle of nowhere? Is that what Millennials are being encouraged forced? to do? I dont see anyone around this sub usually talking about such a drastic lifestyle shift. Has anyone done it? Is anyone seriously considering it? Do you know someone who has?,vancouver,dffzaxn,19,t5_2qhov

With regards to Fraser Hwy it should be noted that the future rapid transit travel times in the study are compared against the localstop  bus during peak hours at the service levels that were provided in . Of course an LRT is going to be significantly faster than the  but there are many ways to bring forth reductions in travel time. At the time of the study service had not yet commenced on the  Aldergrove Express introduced  which today serves Langley passengers and makes the AM Peak inbound journey to Surrey Central in  minutes. The Fraser Highway BLine coming  and associated bus priority investments are set to reduce this even further.Also the SRTAA travel time estimates for LRT do not account for the extra stations Surrey now wants to add on a Fraser Highway line which will add to travel time and slow down transit commuters  so against that future BLine the time savings may indeed end up coming down to  minutes.gt BRT still requires a significant amount of infrastructure...I think everyone realizes that a good BRT will require a significant amount of infrastructure but theres a lot more room for flexibility in the design and phasing of the built components. The estimates in SRTAA were based on a fullbuild system with median busways requiring the same R.O.W. and land footprint standard as the LRT alternative. In practice many of these segments could be started out as queuejumper lanes at the busiest sections similar to what exists today at two intersections on King George Blvd. It would cost much less and be significantly faster to set up.,vancouver,dfgdn41,13,t5_2qhov

11656216,1,t3_66aq8q,gt On Tuesday the B.C. NDP told CBC News that the claim about a billiondollar tax break for the rich assumes that if the tax hadnt been eliminated  million would have continued to roll in year after year. gt If you multiply that by the standard fouryear government term you end up with  billion in revenue from the tax breaks.Sounds like a perfectly reasonable assumption and fairly straightforward math that doesnt involve any creative accounting whatsoever.Its very black and white. The Liberals eliminated a tax on the rich that would have brought in  billion in tax revenue had it not been eliminated. The Liberals made a conscious choice to eliminate  billion in tax income from the richest British Columbians and pushed that debt onto lower income earners.gt My level of expectation from political campaigns after surviving the American presidential campaign is so low. But you know this is not Trumplevel lying  this is sort of within the range of normal.Its not within the range of normal to eliminate taxes on the rich to effectively force impoverished and middle class people to assume rich peoples debt to society.Sounds like J.

11748024,0,t1_dgqnlge,gtHigher corporate taxes higher taxes on households earning over k I also really like this idea of expanding carbon taxing. Raising taxes will discourage investment into BC which will slow economic growth and in the long run mean less government revenue than if the tax rates were kept at what they are.High tax and high deficit jurisdictions are not attractive to investors. They typically have very tepid economic and wage growth. Remember that BC trailed the entire country in median income growth the last time the NDP were in power in the s. Right now BC is outperforming other provinces in producing jobs and is a relatively attractive place to do business. The tech industry has been rapidly growing since  because the province has the right recipe of having slightly lower tax rates and better public finances than other Canadian provinces a city  Vancouver  that has a positive image and the best climate in Canada and an abundance of educated workers. The NDP will squander that by making BCs fiscal position much worse and making the provinces tax rates much less attractive.
