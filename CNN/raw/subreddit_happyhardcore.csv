2287191,0,t1_cltv5e8,Ive been listening to some of Flapjacks mixes and I am really liking them! Ill check out Super K!Im waiting for the location of Fantastic Wax to come out. I might go if it is close to me. I want to try to drive back home right after instead of getting a place to stay the night. Renting a room will be too much money for me since Ill be going solo. ,happyhardcore,cluewd9,2,t5_2rgie

7060577,0,t1_d1c4w8g,There is lots more out there besides the  big names. And those big names had a short bigroom run but they have even changed from that. The genre is constantly evolving but it is great to watch. People like Outforce and putting out super bounceyalmost melbourneish hardcore right now that is fantastic. GTYM Ganar Jekyll Alex Prospect and MOB and some names whoa re also killing it these days. There is just currently SO MUCH hardcore that it can be tough to pick through. But enjoy!,happyhardcore,d1godu6,1,t5_2rgie

10908945,0,t3_5vrwg1,Gammer used to have a video of him and Whizzkid playing live in Japan and I thought Whizzkids MCing was excellent. Good flow and knew when to be quiet and let the music speak for itself. Some MCs get super annoying but I think theres definitely guys who know how to do it right.,happyhardcore,de56i5g,3,t5_2rgie
