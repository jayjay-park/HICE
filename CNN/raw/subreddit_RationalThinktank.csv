10460242,0,t1_dctozsq,gt I think most people conflate pedophilia with rape. Its second nature for you to refer to it as child abuse even when were explicitly only discussing consensual intergenerational sexual relationships here.I think this is the crux of the issue and one that has to be addressed within societies with notions of sexual consent. Can a prepubescent child consent to sex? Ill take the stance of no here with the argument that if the child is prepubescent they dont have the correct biological and emotional background to understand sex I dont mean the penisvagina mechanics of sex but more subtle details like what it means to be sexy what it means to want it etc and to be fully aware of what it is that theyre consenting to.The problem I have with your examples is that theyre cherry picked. I have no doubt in my mind there are men and women who have had sexual experiences when they were prepubescent and came out fine. Likewise Ive driven a car drunk but its not something Id argue should be normalized because I didnt get in a wreck. I would also argue that before an individual hits puberty you can cause physical injuries through what would be otherwise normal sexual activity.gt Moreover when I was a kid talking  here I would have LOVED to have sex with an adult woman. Im going to argue that before you hit puberty any desire you had for sex was due to what you were able to infer about it namely that its for adults only and that its taboo. Maybe you even knew about penises and vaginas. But ultimately you didnt really know what it is that you wanted you just knew that you wanted it.And Ill argue that when you say you wouldve loved to have sex with an adult woman you surely dont mean ANY adult woman? You probably have a conceptualization of an attractive woman in mind when you say that no? Or at least attractive to you. Would you have had sex with someone you considered a  out of  back then if you had the chance?Ultimately Ill go back to my example and take the stance that I think its like driving drunk. I think its true that there are people for whom this type of relationship worked for them. But I just think there are too many ways for it to go wrong.Think about what you said here I know many adult men and women who have suffered severe emotional damage from their adult relationships. Relationships are something we fuck up all the time. What happens when you break up with someone as an adult? You cut off contact maybe go out drinking bury yourself in your work talk to your friends about it thats how you get over it when youre an adult. What happens when youre  and you wanna break up? If someone gets pissed at their partner their own age for breaking up with them how do you think someones gonna take a  year old saying it? You think theyre going to take that seriously? I think enough people fuck around with the emotions of people their own age that when dealing with kids theres no doubt abuse is going to occur.,RationalThinktank,dctrvxi,2,t5_3iqar
