2765769,0,t1_cngctx6,I really thought about leaving the rating stuff out because it does not really tell you much.Like with most things you only follow a series if you like it so because you gernerally like it even bad chapters are good a bit rose tinted glass mode if you will.If you dont like a series you only read the first couple chapters maybe downvote them and then stop reading so the bad votes get lost due to the pure amount of chapters.As you can see in the images the gamer who is second last in the average rating has almost every chapter rated higly and only dropped this low because of  completly trash chapters. Just assuming didnt read themSo for me the average rating and maybe even highestlowest rating does not really tell anything its mostly there because I tried to extract as much information as possible.I mean ignoring Fairytail and Black Behemoth they are all increadibly close together.,manhwa,cniggzo,2,t5_2th0f
