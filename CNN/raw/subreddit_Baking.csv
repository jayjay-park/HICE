The result will be smooth chocolate that will harden to a shell when dried...good for coating pretzels cake pops etc. or drizzling over cupcakes etc. Keep in mind however that the chocolate melted with this method will still get melty when held at body temp...only tempering the chocolate will give it a higher melting point.

490462,0,t1_cfvwvev,For the cake I used a box of chocolate cake mix.  Once baked I crumbled the cake into fine crumbs. Then added Wilton vanilla buttercream icing you can google the recipe I could try to post a link but Im on mobileSo just make the cake pops as any other recipe would direct you to do so.  Roll them into balls chill etcThen I used mini ice cream cones from Walmart. White and dark chocolate wafers I purchased from bulk barn or you could also just use regular chocolate and make sure you add shortening to make the chocolate more liquidy. So what I did was once the cake balls were ready I dipped the cones in a little bit of white melted chocolate around the edges and put the cake ball on the cone and let it dry. So the cake ball doesnt fall off when coating Then dip the cones in into the white chocolate to give it the ice cream look. I drizzled dark chocolate very carefully to make it look like fudge on top of some of the cake pops and also used Swedish berry candies for the cherry. And assorted sprinkles. Using the ice cream cones were SOO much easier than using sticks. And you can choose to not eat the cone. I made these for little kids so they obviously ate the whole thing but my sister and I just ate the cake part.Sorry if these directions suck lol I just woke up and i suck at explaining things P,Baking,cfw0oxg,1,t5_2qx1h

2014392,0,t3_2htpmu,You can use chopped fresh cherries or get the canned ones Oregon brand? that are more expensive but not packed in syrup. With fresh ones Id worry about them weeping liquid when cut so you might give them some time to sit with sugar on as you do for strawberries drain and then reduce that liquid to glaze the cake with between layers maybe with cherry brandy or kirsch. Youll want your cherries to be softer than fresh ones anyway. I think you can get frozen cherries too.The cream you may want to stabilize with gelatin or something to get it to stay put well enough to use as a frosting. But a lot of recipes dont call for this.

2545794,0,t3_2osjrg,A couple of suggestions. I would put the instruction first rather than below the graphic i.e. have your blender icon then on the top of the blender line write mix well together then below that instruction have your icons. I would remove the option for viewing the recipe as the author unless a user has logged in to edit the recipe. Otherwise things like units of measure are unclear. I would have your recipes edited for grammar as well for example both letters of MampM need to be capitalized and referred to as MampMs when multiple candies are required. I would add a bit more instruction too. For instance the baking tray step would be unclear to someone who had never spooned out cookie dough beforeI would add some words about what to do at that point or add a graphic of someone spooning out balls of dough. Overall cool idea though Im sure this would be useful for firsttime cooks and kids learning to cook. ,Baking,cmqveey,1,t5_2qx1h

2571295,0,t1_cmu5iia,I thought the point of weighing dry ingredients was that  ounces of flour by weight is always the same amount while  cup of flour can vary depending on how densely its packed moisture content etc.  But if you go by a conversion chart then whats the point?  Youre assuming that  of flour cup always  . ounces by weight.  Thats no more accurate than just skipping the conversion and measuring with a cup.In any case...I think telling a new baker like the OP to convert recipes from volume measurements to weight is needlessly complicating things.  I do see the value of weighing ingredientsI have a good kitchen scale and I use it frequently.

Or if you whisk the eggs too much you will notice it grows and grows and grows. If you reduce this to a minimum it could help you.Also try lowering the temp of your oven and add a couple of minutes to the cooking time. The way cookie dough works is it first melts then settles then rises.

3073993,0,t3_2v8tmd,What pie filling did you use? How much lemon juice? I have a feeling that affected your whipped cream differently than the recipe. Stiff whipped cream is easy to check for. You should be able to tip the bowl upside down without the whipped cream falling out.Your whipped cream just fell which is natural for fresh whipped cream to do. You can do some tricks to try and prevent that from happening. I would have personally added some gelatin or melted marshmallowsgelatin to stiffen things up but that can be a bit tricky. Another product you can use is whipped topping powder. Itll help stiffen and set the whipped cream with gelsstabilizers. Its really easy and cheap to use. If I am going to be mixing whipped cream with something like the pie filling I whip the cream in my food processoror a hand blender will work if thats possible. The food processor makes the best stabilized whipped cream with just powder sugar. Note the texture will be a bit heavy but with the lemon pie filling itll work out. A regular blender wont work for this.You can also try adding some white chocolate or cream cheesemake sure its room temp can also help stabilize your whipped cream. ,Baking,cogm8fz,3,t5_2qx1h

7126853,0,t1_d1o1vc1,I think semolina would get you a coarser texture than using corn or rice flour.  If I use it I tend to not be exactly precise in adding it but it usually ends up being approximately a quarter of my flour measurement.Since youve said your doughs been crumbly twice I think you have too much in the way of dry ingredients.  Other people have mentioned the  ratio which is a good one to stick by.  With your weights you come out to  definitely not enough butter.  When I said paste before I didnt mean paste in the sense that you could stick it in a piping bag and it would go it should be far too thick for that.  Basically when youve mixed all your ingredients together everything should come together in your bowl as a ball.  Definitely at that point before you chill it. My recipe is somewhat haphazard but I do have a base for it that I would be delighted to share.  This base doesnt use semolina because I often make empire biscuits which prefer a softer shortbread but just experiment with the flour component.  Ingredients g butter g caster sugar I like to add vanilla flavoured sugar here probably about g g plain flourMethod Heat oven to gas mark  and line a baking sheet with parchment. Cream butter and sugar til light and fluffy. Gently stir in the flour to get a thick paste.   Turn dough out on to a floured surface roll and cut into the desired shapes fingers rounds petticoats... up to you!.  Place on the baking tray and chill for  minutes. Bake for  minutes or until pale goldenbrown and still slightly soft to touch.  Cool for a couple of minutes before lifting on to a wire rack to cool completely.  I realise the baking time is longer than your aunts but I think my oven is on the weaker side so I often leave things in for longer.  Try checking around the  minute mark?,Baking,d1o8pf1,1,t5_2qx1h

7778744,0,t3_4lva89,I have to say these are THE BEST cookies I have ever made. They were the perfect size and texture. Fluffy and soft. I used the following recipeWith some variations I planned on making the dough a day ahead of time so I didnt worry about completely melting the butter since it would just be solidified again once the dough was stored in the refrigerator. I threw it in the microwave long enough to melt maybe  of it and the rest was just soft. I needed to use some leftover opened bags of different chips I had. I used a total of . cups like the recipe calls for but it was probably twothirds standard milk chocolate chips and onethird Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate  Cacao Baking Chips. I also added in about threefourths a cup of chopped walnuts. None of this altered the recipe much but figured I would explain for the sake of the pictures. In the recipe info she mentions that her cookies before baked were . ounces. I like to work with grams so thats  grams. I used my scale to see what  grams of dough looked like and I thought it was a little too big than what I wanted so I scaled down to  grams.  I did do the method that she mentions on the recipe. You roll the dough into a ball pull it in half rotate the halves  degrees so that the parts were they were just connected is facing up then rejoin the dough. For this part I noticed that I should try to make sure that the dough is in a circle shape on the outside in order to keep the final product as circular as possible. Finally I baked the cookies for  minutes to adjust for the smaller size I made them compared to what the recipe calls for. The cookies were just barely set on the outside and only slightly browned in a few spots. I did make sure to cool them on the baking sheet. If I recall correctly I was able to make  cookies total. Hard to say because they seem to have a habit of quickly disappearing. Hope this helps some others in the quest for THE PERFECT chocolate chip cookies!,Baking,d3qdnk7,16,t5_2qx1h

Ive been on the hunt for a good vanilla cupcake recipe recently and this is my favorite so far. I started with white cake recipes I like the stark white color which are often made with a bunch of egg whites and only one egg yolk but I found them too dry and some had a distinctly eggy taste from all the egg whites. They are topped with a simple vanilla buttercream and a few festive sprinkles.Vanilla cupcakesMakes  cupcakes  c. g unsalted butter softened   c. g granulated sugar  large eggs  t. vanilla extract I used clear  t. salt  t. baking powder  c. g allpurpose flour  c. g whole milk. Prepare two muffin tins with paper liners spray lightly with nonstick spray.. In the bowl of a stand mixer you could use a hand mixer cream together butter and sugar. . Add in the eggs vanilla salt and baking powder and beat until smooth. . Alternate adding the milk and flour in  or  batches. Mix until just combined.. Fill muffin cups  full with batter.

To do it properly alternate adding the powdered sugar and heavy cream  c. and  T. at a time respectively beating at high speed in between.. Add salt and vanilla.. Beat the shit out of it until light and fluffy.. Adjust consistency if desired by adding more powdered sugar or heavy cream.

8325814,0,t3_4tlva8,I love this recipe because it makes skyhigh fluffy flaky biscuits with lots of layers! I ate mine with honey and butter today but these are also perfect for biscuits and gravy!Buttermilk BiscuitsMakes  biscuits Ingredients  cups allpurpose flour spooned and leveled   teaspoons baking powder  teaspoon baking soda  teaspoon salt  teaspoons granulated sugar  tablespoons butter cubed and frozen simply chilled also works  tablespoons shortening chilled   cup buttermilk chilled   tbsp butter melted for brushing optionalInstructions  . Preheat oven to  degrees.. In a large mixing bowl combine flour baking powder baking soda salt and sugar. Using a pastry blender cut butter and shortening into dry ingredients until mixture looks like coarse crumbs alternatively you can use your fingers to rub the butter and shortening into the flour mixture but the faster the better you dont want the fats to melt! . Make a well in the center and pour in the chilled buttermilk. Stir just until the dough comes together. The dough will be very sticky.. Turn dough onto floured surface dust top with flour and gently fold dough over on itself  or  times. This will create layers in the final baked biscuits. Press into a  inch  thick round. Cut out biscuits with a . or inch cutter being sure to push straight down through the dough. Do not twist the cutter! Twisting the cutters inhibits rising. Place biscuits on baking sheet so that they are half an inch apart. Reform scrap dough working it as little as possible and continue cutting. Biscuits from the second or third pass will not be quite as pretty as those from the first but theyll still taste great.. Bake until biscuits are tall and lightly golden on top about  minutes.. Brush biscuits with melted butter right out of oven if desired. ,Baking,d5ia5fq,25,t5_2qx1h

I enjoy getting really obsessive about recipes the more steps the better as long as it improves the end result. The main recipe I chose to emulate was this one  with two specific twists I didnt have high gluten flour and I didnt have lye but I had bread flour and Vital Wheat Gluten and I had baked baking soda so I went with it.King Arthur bread flour is only . protein not gluten protein. No one lists if this is by weight or volume so I just went with weight. High gluten flour is about . protein by weight. American recipes use protein and gluten interchangeably and while gluten is a protein they arent really interchangeable apparently in other countries like France and Japan the gluten content and the protein content will be listed on the side but not here. Since it was impossible to try to approach the correct amount of gluten I decided to just approach the correct amount of protein. solving a multivariable equation y  .  x  .  y  x  . where y is bread flour in grams and x is Vital Wheat Gluten in grams tells you that x  .y. A cup of flour is  grams generally so you need about . grams VWG for  cup of flour in the recipe. Pro tip searching for kitchen scales rarely yields results that have an accuracy greater than  gram so search for drug scales and you can find things with greater accuracy. Besides its not like the scale cares what you put on it.So thats the flour it would still be better to get high gluten flour somewhere else and I will be hunting for some but it serves its purpose. I cut the ingredients down to th since I wanted to make some test bagels. I screwed up in one big way at this juncture I didnt give the sponge enough time. follow the directions let it sit especially if your water is colder than  degrees F or the water test will never work for you. My bagel came out a bit boring because of this. I also probably could have kneaded it a bit more as the chew wasnt particularly amazing either. But I made the bagels and I chucked them on a baking sheet to retard in the fridge over night.Heres where things get tricky unless youre a chemist or really obsessive about making bagels. Lye sodium hydroxide NaOH is an extremely strong base the Sauron of bases basically. it dissociates almost entirely in water and is extremely acidic. Baking soda the base that almost everyone has in their kitchen doesnt compare. lye has a pH of  at N  L and baking soda has a ph of .. according to this recipe here  grams of lye can be dissolved into  liters of water for a good bagel crust resulting in a solution with a pH of .. You wouldnt even get close with baking soda youd need cups of the stuff and I believe the reason lye is so prevalent is because it has the least opportunity to impart any flavor it completely dissociates and leaves very little behind. If youre dumping gobs of baking soda into your water your bagels are going to taste like baking soda. So what do you do? Well a bit of a compromise really.It turns out if you bake baking soda it will let off CO and water and turn into sodium carbonate known sometimes as washing soda. Washing soda is considerably more basic than baking soda though still magnitudes less than lye as the pH scale is logarithmic. this source says a .N solution has a pH of . which is about x less basic than the . we are looking for but light years better than .. But herpderpdoo you ask I know based on this slideshow that the normality of active hydrogen or hydroxide in a solution is the only factor that determines pH so why is .N of washing soda not equal to the .N of lye? The answer to that question is hm good point. I think the author meant .M or perhaps since washing soda is diprotic .M   ignoring the fact that that is just the count of OH in the solution and not the amount that will dissociate. In any case the number listed is fairly correct and is lower than lye because not all of the washing soda dissociates in fact going by that number only  of it actually dissociates! What this means for us is that we wont get quite as close as we want to for alkalinity without changing the taste but we can get much closer or use much less washing soda than baking soda. This is something Im still fiddling with I went with  grams of washing soda which ended up with a beautiful crust but still slightly weird tasting bagels. Next time I will go with  grams and just take the x alkalinity hit.With the lye and the flour dialed in I just followed the directions on the recipe also cross checking with this guide which is also an excellent resource. Since I didnt give enough time for my sponge to activate my bagel took forever to float in the water so I ended up cooking for  minute submerged and then  seconds on the bottom of the bagel since it handt browned as much. I took the bagel out of the water and against my better judgement tried to dip it into the toppings as I had seen on another guide and it was terrible that is the grey you see smeared on the side of the bagel it is black salt. Next time Ill just sprinkle the toppings on like everyone else. into the  degree oven and it only took  minutes or so to get a really nice golden brown outer shell. It tasted kind of pretzely but the shell had a great crunch and the inside was warm and dense though not as chewy as I would like. Also just like in the NYT article the bottom cracked a bit so I will be turning my bagels halfway through next time.Im resting the other two bagels at room temperature right now in hopes that they will eventually pass the water test at which point I will retard them further and see if I cant get a slightly better bagel out of them. as for what Ive learned for next time. let the sponge sit as long as it needs to no matter what. use only  grams of whatever alkali salt you choose for your water to avoid flavoring your bagels the boil is the most important step for a golden brown crust anyways. sprinkle toppings do not dip. flip the bagels halfway through bakingif there are any questions or any advice too please post away!,Baking,d8fghit,1,t5_2qx1h

I just happened to come upon the peanut butter variety and thought it would be perfect for this recipe!   tablespoons butter meltedFor the cheesecake filling   ounces cream cheese at room temperature   large eggs    cups lightly packed light brown sugar   cup creamy peanut butter   cup heavy cream   teaspoon vanilla   ounces Reeses minis   I could only find the wrapped miniatures not the unwrapped minis so I adjusted accordingly as will be notedFor the topping   cup semisweet chocolate chips   cup heavy cream    ounces Reeses minis   for the topping I just cut each miniature in halfDirectionsFor the crust  Preheat the oven to F.  In the bowl of a food processor process the cookies until they are finely ground crumbs.   Add the butter and pulse until moistened.   Press into the bottom and halfway up the sides of a inch springform pan.   Bake for  minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool.For the filling  In the bowl of an electric mixer beat the cream cheese until smooth.   Add the eggs one at a time beating until smooth.   Add in the sugar peanut butter cream and vanilla and beat until combined. Be careful not to overbeat. Stir in the Reeses.   I pulsed mine in the food processor a couple of times to make reeses cup pieces since I didnt have the minis  Pour the batter into the cooled crust.   Bake for about  hour or until set and the top looks slightly dry. If the middle is slightly wobbly thats fine.   Cool the cheesecake completely on a wire rack. Refrigerate until completely chilled at least  hours.   Release the cheesecake from the pan onto a cake stand or serving plate.For the topping  Place the chocolate chips in a medium heatproof bowl.   In a small saucepan heat the cream just until simmering. Pour over the chocolate chips.   Let sit for  minutes before stirring until the mixture is melted and smooth.   Pour over the cheesecake allowing to drip down the sides.   Sprinkle the Reeses over the cheesecake.   Serve or cover and store in the fridge for up to  days.,Baking,d97iqdo,1,t5_2qx1h

You want to add as little as possible. Gather the shaggy dough together as best you can into a mush ball and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. I fridged for an hour but you can leave it up to  hours or freeze it even. I rolled out in batches as the lattice is time consuming. I rolled out the bottom put it in the tin trimmed the edges and stuck it in the freezer while I worked on the lattice. For the lattice I find that making a long rectangle is easiest to cut strips.  The dough is sorta argumentative and I had to fold it over on itself a few times to get it pliable. Still try not to over work the crap out of it. Lattice work is being mindful of strip length and width. I used a pizza cutter to cut the strips and start in the middle and work my way out weaving.     Heres an image to help.     Weaving pattern  I tried to use the widestlongest strip as my anchor straight across the middle and build vertical lines out on both sides using thinner strips as I go. Dont seal them to the edges yet!  Then turn filled with apples if I hadnt mentioned that yet pie  degrees and start in the middle again but lift everyother strip. Tuck weaver strips snug but not too tightly as you want a little juice to escape the holes.        Apple filling       I sorta winged it with this pie as we are super poor this month and I was using random apples my hubs acquired from his food prep job.  I used  medium gala apples  Granny Smith and one near dead red delicious. Since they werent tart apples I reduced sugar to a  cup and used dark brown sugar instead of white. Added a pinch of cloves as well.  I only had  apples and my pie wasnt as thick as Id like it but still tastes good.        cups thinly sliced  peeled apples  medium    cup sugar  tablespoons allpurpose flour    teaspoon ground cinnamon    teaspoon salt  teaspoon ground nutmeg    tablespoon lemon juice    Bake at  degrees for  minutes covered edges with foil and baked another  minutes.

Knowing your icing and how it behaves while youre mixing it is absolutely necessary because without a good icing youre gonna be miserable the entire time youre decorating. I have things I look for while Im making my batch I want to see the pattern of the paddle in the sides of the bowl I dont want the icing to be liquidy looking I want it to have substance and to feel like marshmallow fluff. When I pull the spoon up from the batch I want a dollop of it to fall off at once before it runs like a liquid from it.

10475362,0,t1_dcv604m,Since no laws actually apply in most cases there arent any real possible legal ramifications. But as someone that runs a bakery I could provide my own anecdotal thoughts. As far as tact goes Id say if someone came to me and wanted a piece for piece down to the most minute detail replica of an elaborate cake Id say no but Id offer to stick with the general scheme and give my own personal twist to it. Stick with the idea without being a complete ripoff. But people bring me basic Pinterest pictures all the time and I dont really see a problem with that since usually they just bring them because they dont know how to articulate mint rosettes on the top tier white scrolls and dots over a coral base on the bottom tier.Theres actually a bakery across town that likes to steal our really specific ideas a couple days after we post on them instagram and I just have to laugh about it.

Put in a decent tsp and give it a taste you can always add more in drop by drop just depends on the strength of essence you have. Or you could go with adding a flavour that is more intense such as a lemon buttercream  hope this helps ,Baking,dcx6l6l,1,t5_2qx1h

10736506,0,t3_5tlqaj,RecipeThe cake is whats often called a  cake except I used sour cream instead of milk. Yep this is not a low calorie cake. It is however delicious. Here is the general procedure to follow For the lemon flavor I added the zest of two large lemons and a quick squeeze of the juice while I was beating in the eggs. I opted to make two thicker cake layers instead of three thinner ones. I make a blackberry jam filling simply by warming it and thinning it out with some lemon juice and a little vanilla and using it as a filling in between. Dont use too much or it will drip over the edges. But really the hard part here is the mirror glaze. This was my first official attempt after doing a test run last week that didnt go so great so I can give some tips here on how to troubleshoot. I weighed everything and I would recommend you do the sameprecision is very important to get this glaze to work. g Granulated Sugarg Sweetened Condensed Milk ml water for the sugar  cup   tbsg Gelatin Powder  ml water for the gelatin  cup g white Chocolate Chipsgel food coloringMix the gelatin with its water and let it sponge. Basically it will be a big gloppy blob. Mix the sugar water and sweetened condensed milk on the stove over medium heat until all dissolved and simmering at the edges. Add the gelatin mixture and dissolve thoroughly. Pour over your chocolate chips and let sit for a few minutes. Carefully stir it until you have a smooth mixture. Now you can add your color. Youll have to use more than you think you will. You can separate your glaze into different bowls and use different colors! I used Wilton regal purple. I also used a whitening agent masterchef instant white to up the opacity. If you have air bubble stuck in there that you cant get out strain it through a sieve and then just let it sit. You must get it to  degrees F or . C. Do not pour it sooner or it will be too thin. I did this on a rackin the future I think Ill use a pedestal set up because the drips harden and make it challenging to move. ,Baking,ddne1if,8,t5_2qx1h

10750626,0,t1_ddosxni,Ive had Baumstriezel in Munich though and it was a single layer of enriched dough spiraled around a large spit. Perhaps its true that in some places the definitions arent as strict but it could also be the case that youve simply never seen proper Baumkuchen if you think its much like Baumstriezel. Anyway I dont doubt that people can be lax with these terms but that doesnt mean that the distinctions dont exist.

Add all dry ingredients flour salt baking soda baking powder cocoa etc. to a stand mixer with whisk attachment. Mix to combine.  Use room tempsoftened butter instead of oil and add to dry mixture. Mix on low for a couple minutes until small crumbs form. Think of the texture of Parmesan cheese in the plastic shakers.  Add an extra egg to wet ingredients. Combine all wet ingredients milkwater eggs vanilla etc in separate bowl. Slowly add to dry mix while mixer is on lowmed speed.  Scrape bowl using a spatula to make sure all ingredients are just combined. Do not overmix!! Scoop into cupcake or cake pans and bake as directed by recipe.The cake comes out with a dense yet fluffy texture and very moist!!!
