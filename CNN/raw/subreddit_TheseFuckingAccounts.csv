3287403,0,t1_cp1qaoa,Just a thought wouldnt it be possible to implement a kamadecay type bot that curates the subreddit in a listentothis style fashion where if it is determined the image is a repost and not original it is automatically removed? Making the subreddit be more focused on new original content as opposed to people posting pictures everybody has already seen?,TheseFuckingAccounts,cp2znia,1,t5_35hx5

6593006,0,t1_d017rb0,Pretty bad huh? I tried collecting names for a while but some of the accounts go dormant and new ones crop up. They all submit from legit news sources too so its not like banning a domain to stop them would work. If the admins ever decide to act on this the only thing that would remotely work would be an IP ban.,TheseFuckingAccounts,d019rl7,1,t5_35hx5
