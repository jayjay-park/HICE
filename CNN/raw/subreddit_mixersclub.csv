9258743,0,t1_d8plsms,I havent. I dont deserve to be called a true fan because I didnt even know they had a new album out. I spend entirely too much time working or on reddit to keep up with the music scene and too much money on flavor concentrates and other things that are essential to life to spend anything on it. But thats ok because my ears are stuck in the s and s anyway.  ,mixersclub,d8pm296,1,t5_3g2sw
9912161,0,t3_5dcg2v,OakeduthattswhatshesaidI need to keep this brief because Ive been sick and its caused me to be behind at work and not have much time for extracurricular activities but I also dont want to fall behind on critiques. This tastes mostly like butter and maple and it is delicious. The butter is not at all like movie theater popcorn butter its like a generous scoop of real sweet cream butter. The maple is delightful too. Theres some vanilla as well along with an eggy custard note. It feels like I was served French toast with a big scoop of butter and a big dollop of vanilla whipped cream which then had warm maple syrup poured over it so that the butter and whipped cream started to melt but then the bread but not the milk and eggs that the bread was dipped in was magically taken away and replaced with a woody note like one of these things the syrup I suppose had been stored in an oak barrel. That is both strange as it seems out of place from a culinary reference point perspective and delightful. I mean it just tastes great and I think the oddity of the oak is what really makes me want more. Although nothing is offtasting or unpleasant Im afraid it would be just too much buttery maplely richness to have me wanting more without that oaken aspect surprising my palate like it does. Constructive criticism? I dont have much to offer other than suggesting that the description of ice cream seems quite a bit off to me unless were talking about some seriously overchurned ice cream with a little whipped cream on top. It tastes great. Possibly too rich and buttery for an ADV but what a great dessert or breakfast vape. I would like to play with it though just because this is the first vape Ive had that really screamed out sweet cream butter and maple syrup to me. I might like to try taking out the oak and replacing it with the bread that disappeared from my French toast along with turning everything down like reducing all s by  while maintaining the same tasty ratios to make room for that. French toast pancakes an extremely decadent waffle are all possibilities. Or I might try leaving the oak and all the s the same and adding something to help oak cut even deeper into that heavy richness possibly by adding something that complements oak well such as a whiskey. It seems to me that almost anything that isnt fruit cream theres enough of that or tobacco might be a fun addition here so nuts bakeries alcohols. On the other hand adding something might just amount to unnecessarily cluttering up an already fascinating profile. Edit totally failed at my attempted at brevity. oops. ,mixersclub,dazkt6s,1,t5_3g2sw

10653279,0,t3_5e9b0t,This made me giggle. Mainly because I am the wife in this scenario.  I really dont care too much about the hardware as long as it works and I can get a nice huge cloud. Oddly enough I have the rx and Griffin. I got the rx because I broke my last mod and it was the first one I saw for sale on facebook. I have the Griffin because my husband builds all of my coils and he likes to build on it. I am not mechanically inclined like he is so I struggle to keep up when he goes into detail talking about the various aspects involved in building coils and functions of the various mods. However diy juice is where we come together. I LOVE the chemistry behind mixing flavors together to achieve a certain outcome. I spend hours researching and he uses his background as a chef to create something spectacular. And yes I often have various bottles in the black hole I drag around with me. In the end we have a hobby we both enjoy and enjoy together. ,mixersclub,ddesy1f,2,t5_3g2sw
