5180508,0,t1_cvafb7o,Actually with GHOST you get the same security with much shorter block times because youre not throwing away the proof of work on orphaned blocks. For quantitative details see the GHOST paper pdf.The  second delay only decreases number of customers if you wait for verification before moving to the next customer. Starbucks is asynchronous it takes the payment tells someone to pour coffee moves to next customer. The first verification will generally come back before the coffee is ready especially with the more expensive drinks.In any case  seconds may not be perfect but its better than  minutes and theyre hoping to shorten it to  seconds or less when they transition to proof of stake. For small purchases people using Bitcoin generally skip verification anyway which people could also do with Ethereum.

The price is going down because Theres no roadmap beyond vague moving codenames and moving dates that no one really understand. People that are trading want a clear roadmap to be able to gauge progress.  They are giving halftruths as to the state of their organization and people can sense it.

That never inspires confidence. A year and half later we still have no visibility on their finances beyond whatever Vitalic distills in a few blog posts here and there. We have x ltinsert name of coingt left he writes. No one ever asked for a full on line by line budget but somelevel of transparency might have helped.

Augur wanted to build a prediction market.  They couldnt give me a clear explanation of how it was supposed to work and they gave the impression that a they hadnt figured it out themselves.  Im not putting money into something I dont understand.Understand that as a rep holder you are expected to act as an oracle.  That means that you have to become informed about whatever people are betting on.  So if they bet on an election in some country you never heard of you have to go find the results and enter them into the system.  Your input is also weighted by how much rep you hold.  Im way too lazy for that.On the presale page I submitted a question what prevents a large rep holder from entering false results to steal the pot of a large bet?  The answer I got was that even more than raising money they wanted fair distribution.  What the f does that mean?I wish the project well but they dont have a clear vision of what they are building or if they do they did a lousy job of communicating it.

5870467,0,t1_cxp0qxj,Help me wrap my head around this.  If fuel becomes agnosticized this will arguably create more inclusion  adoption though Im sure this is debatable.  And while ETH will lose its uniqueness as the only fuel it will retain its uniqueness as the sole collector of tx fees in addition to the sole staking currency securing the ethereum blockchain.  If the above is correct ETH will essentially lose one thing and gain another.  It will lose its uniqueness as the only fuel for smart contracts however it stands to gain increased widespread adoption which increases the  of dapps and increases tx fees rendered to ETH holders.  Moreover the larger the entire value of the ethereum dapp network becomes the larger the value of ETH must become in order to properly secure the value of the whole system via PoS.   Is my reasoning above wrong anywhere I would not put it past me?  If not then I have a hard time seeing how fuel agnosticism is ultimately a bad thing for ETH holders.  Although I admit that my entire argument stands or falls on the assumption that fuel agnosticism promotes inclusion and increases adoption.  ,ethtrader,cxp5e8s,6,t5_37jgj

You also could mitigate your risk as a user with an escrow service so charges can be reversed if need be. These services might add to the cost compared to completely trusting the system but still be cheaper than a centralized solution.

For example theres no known way to build a light client for sidechains. And contracts are a lot simpler with accounts instead of transaction outputs. Rootstock claims to just copy the Ethereum VM but doesnt say what changes they made to deal with UTXOs or how that affects contract complexity.Meanwhile BTC Relay lets you migrate bitcoins over to Ethereum and in principle coins could be migrated back to Bitcoins chain if Bitcoin nodes monitored Ethereums chain.

ETH in circulation float is  million while only  million BTC in circulation. So it does not make sense to compare ETH price to BTC price directly you have to adjust for difference in float. That is divide ETH price by M and multiply by M. This way you get floatadjusted ETH price that can be directly compared to BTC price.

This typically means moving the wallet key file from your computer to a separate storage device that is not connected to the internet such as a USB drive.

6867106,0,t1_d0uhfih,Altcoins have always ridden on the coattails of bigger coins bull runs its market economics. Most people who hold Ether arent all that into the tech they bought it because it was going up and Bitcoin wasnt. When their stack inflates in value they diversify and seek the next speculation.I dont personally have the time to investigate the merits of different alts but I do take your point that in principle they could be simulated on top of Ethereum.I guess the viability of alts will depend on what the future role of Ethereum turns out to be  if it becomes a generalpurpose blockchain that billions of devices talk to IoT alts will tend to retreat to specialist niches where the universalitytrust aspects of a global blockchain are not that important and noone can be bothered to invest the effort to port their features to Ethereum because the players within the niche are happy with what they have.I agree with ublangbus that Bitcoin is unlikely to die anytime soon it is over  years old after all. The danger to it as I see it is that of retreating to a niche. The problem with niches is they have trouble attracting the best developer talent  those people want to work on new and interesting things. Its the B and Clist developers who often end up taking a job to pay the bills in a niche field that is no longer actively progressing.I can recommend Geoffrey Moores Gorilla Game as a good text on the subject of tech market dominance.In most tech fields where there are incentives for users to concentrate their choices e.g. operating systems or databases where switching costs are high and finding the right talent quickly is important you usually end up with a Gorilla market leader a Chimp the Number  and some Kings and Princes companies who have command of their field but cannot manipulate switching costs to their advantage. I can see the crypto market heading in a similar direction.

The Bitreserve domain name debacle isnt a big thing either its just a company being a company. Seriously. Obviously they pursued a new name and route after they couldnt get what they wanted. That seems fair enough as it is. The BS with Andreas is overblown. No one EVER threatened to sue Andreas. Ever. It was all a miscommunication over Twitter when the CEO of Uphold said any trademark issues would be handled by their lawyers. Even if the CEO of Uphold doesnt know who Andreas is that doesnt mean the company isnt great at what it does. CEOs hire advisers and other execs to do the mental lifting for them seems maybe they could have done a better job at researching and know who the major figures were in Bitcoin. My point stands. Buying Ether with bank credit all over world and instantly convert funds. Thats all that matters. No scamming. Its just a startup trying to find its niche and pivoting as needed. Nothing new here or scammy here. Want a real scam?

7240071,0,t3_4ehj7j,In a steady state its the velocity of money calculation which is what determines the total value of any currency. Thats the value of the goods and services sold for the currency its GDP divided by the average number of times the currency changes hands over the same time period.With rapid growth the value is also affected by expectations of future growth. When people buy stock in companies they dont just look at current earnings they look at how much the company is likely to grow over time. A fastgrowing company is worth more than one thats stable or shrinking. For a given expected growth rate you can do a financial calculation to get the present value of that future growth.For Ethereum proofofstake gives another answer stakers earn transaction fees so you take total annual fees and divide by the annual return demanded by stakers. E.g. if the stakers want a  return you divide annual fees by . i.e. multiply by . That puts a floor on ether value its the value youd get if ether were used for nothing but staking. Since proofofstake isnt implemented yet youd want to discount that for the chance that it never happens.,ethtrader,d21565x,2,t5_37jgj

7547421,0,t1_d2zyihz,The arbitrage opportunity is riskfree up until the first proposal is accepted.  After that the percentage of ETH retrievable via a split is reduced by the amount committed to the proposal.  Given the huge sums invested in The DAO the short period between the crowdsale and the first proposal for Slock and in my opinion the terrible investment proposition of funding any proposals under the terms of The DAO I think there is a distinct possibility the supply of DAO tokens will far exceed the demand.  I cant believe the majority of DAO token holders actually want to fund any projects.  If tens of millions of dollars worth of DAO tokens are being panic sold before the first proposal is accepted can we be sure there are enough investors with enough capital and time to take advantage of the arbitrage?  Maybe but Im not as certain as most people seem to be.I think most people have invested in The DAO because they think they can cash out riskfree but they dont realize the complexity and time commitment involved in performing a split.  In my opinion The DAO is like a car full of people driving towards a cliff the first proposal.  These people dont realize the severity of the cliff and anyway they can always jump out at the last minute...but can they really when panic sets in?How many investors realize that it takes a week from the moment you initiate a split to when the split actually occurs?  How many investors know that if they vote on a proposal yes or no they cannot split until that proposal is resolved?  Im guessing not many have taken the time to research these things and Im anticipating chaos and panic.  Either that or blind irrational exuberance which is why Im still trying to decide if I should get in that metaphorical car despite my reservations.,ethtrader,d303std,5,t5_37jgj

In one of his newsletters back in  may have been  cant remember edit  he talked about this new technology and digital currency called Bitcoin and he thought that it held a lot of promise and could end up being a viable alternative to fiat currencies for wealth preservation and liquidity particularly during a collapse or crisis. I remember looking into it at the time and BTC was trading for pennies and I remember thinking of buying a few hundred dollars worth and just put it away and forget about it and see what happens.

7722654,0,t1_d3jyuc7,Your probably right. Im pointing out how economical it would be to contract the mechanism porn was the most profitable and exploited so I went with it. My first concern is protecting providers. We can protect any content with subs like reddit. Reddit is very uncensored immoral content is everywhere. But for the greatest part reddit has the best community Ive seen on the net. Trolls on reddit are very few compared to other communities.The DAO has a board and can vote on changes needed as they arise. This ETH community on reddit is also very moral group Ive been around ever. Where theres a concern you see someone trying to ensure it legal moral and fair in every way. Steps this community will take ensuring the right and ownership to property will bring the masses. It will happen this quarter of a decade we are the only ones that know it. Ignorant adopters will gravitate to blockchains faster than anything in history after its proven to protect an secure any asset. This comfort zone is possible right now. Its far from a theory that needs more supervised research to ensure its up to par for monopolisers to control. Money makes the world go round. We will make it fair and protected. Blockchain tech is the one truth and its here just like the dawn of the internet was not so long ago it is unstoppable.Shared innovation towards a mutually common goal. is what I feel crypto will rise as a platform that protects artists and innovation. Banking is going to take time to make obsolete. Attracting new adopters will come as fast as we show we can protect them and thier best interestsA side chain would be ideal but should depend on ETH.,ethtrader,d3k0h0c,1,t5_37jgj

7766806,0,t3_4lnxsr,As hodlor pointed out you are taking the word cash out too literally. Also I can tell you what I have done and I am sure others have done as well. Shorting BTC is really very risky in these bull runs. As you can see BTC can move really fast and stop or margin you out. But ETH gives you the chance to short BTC with an exponential upside and after a big rise as we have seen minimal downside risk plus an added benefit of having a few minutes to react in the ETHBTC pair after BTC goes parabolic. The reason being is that in the beginning of the bull run a lot of traders will move from ETH to BTC this causes a larger drop in the ETHBTC trading pair then the raise in BTC. But as the bull run strengthens some traders begin to take profits those profits a portion come back to ETH and at some point more money starts to flow into ETH at a faster rate the  flowing out  people dont want to buy at the top. So after a big run in BTC I feel that longing ETH is a better option to shorting BTC if that is your goal. ,ethtrader,d3p0vsu,3,t5_37jgj

We dont have to touch the stove as often so to speak. Philosophical differences aside I think the management of this problem was a tremendous success in two big ways People arent going to lose their shirts like they did with Gox. The reality is most people will get their money back unless they were margin trading DAO tokens or something. If thats the case they knew the risks. If they didnt theyre idiots. Even though this is a hard fork decided by a smaller group of users the solution itself speaks to the effective decentralization of the network. Look at how they had to slow the attack basically the creator of ethereum had to beg exchangesminers to put their operations on a hold. No one actor could stop that train on their own.

Any time spent in a trollbox would show you exactly what is going on.  Once the shorts are covered and certainty regarding a HF seems assured we will see a recovery.,ethtrader,d506ycz,9,t5_37jgj

8276895,0,t1_d5c5mb6,Great response. Agreed and disagreed with some points.gtYes but I would argue that peoples view on where ethereum is currently is  months ahead of reality. Basically people thought that over the last year ethereum advanced to the point of being read for huge financial contracts. But thats still a year away.Im sorry but there were no facts in that. That was pure opinion and conjecture. You are making several assumptions You know what the average persons view on Ethereum is You know the mindset of those interested in buyingselling ETH and their use case. People bought ETH assuming it was ready for that particular usecase immediately. You know that ETH wont be ready for another year to handle huge financial contracts.Thats a ton of assumptions none of which can be proven.gtThis is circular logic and leads you to the exact wrong conclusion about all asset bubbles. Its because an asset has done so well so fast that it falls very hard. A quickly rising asset attracts more bullish speculators specifically because it seems like a great investment. As the asset falls these people abandon it because the reason they bought in ceases to be true.Thats a fair point. I can see that.gtThen you get a nd longer and slower drop that takes you much lower as people continue liquidating. Its a fairly consistent pattern across all assets Ive ever traded. Also a good point. This is basically wordforword what happened with BTC. But I think circumstances were different. It remains to be seen whether ETH is the real deal or just another altcoin that got pumped.,ethtrader,d5c65bp,2,t5_37jgj

For most purposes were fine trusting a consortium of banks for example.  If I want to buy coffee I dont need that transaction to be trustless I just want it to be fast and cheap.

In another post somebody wrote uWegie i think that Plutus would buy a stash of ETH to power their paymentexchange service. So what happens if ETH increases in price dramatically good since we like to hold positions in ETH hence making it impossible for Plutus to sustain their network bad because they cannot afford so much ETH.But maybe Plutus needs . ETH to maintain their services for a year i dont know because i dont have estimates. This scenario would be great for Ethereum but terrible for ETH holders because they bought transaction tokens for too much.

The best time to plant a tree was when ETH was at USD the next best time was anytime between then and now.People now hopefully come to their senses and start looking at the market cap. The market cap of ETH is far higher than the joint market cap of some individual more focused projects. I would rather spread my investments over a couple smaller ones that may go  than put it all in ETH which may move . made  on Burst today while you are sitting around with a bunch of overpriced ETH and some hopes for better days. Think of your opportunity cost also. Furthermore this subreddit is named ETH trader not ETH hodlor.I feel that the magic of ETH is a bit over. The value proposition is not bullet proof the hack did not help. The influx of capital required to make ETH move is enormous and there is not much yet to justify this. I could very well be wrong but before I invest in ETH again I would like to see something that has a usecase and works and makes a profit for itself and ETH actually a downside of ETH as a platform that there are two organisations that need to make money i.e. the dapp and Ethereum for it to be interesting to invest in.,ethtrader,d7kymlz,2,t5_37jgj

8977270,0,t1_d7qx63n,yes of course GDAX trades at a relative premium and discount to whichever exchange is the volume leader in our case polo due to transaction costs in moving coin from polo to GDAX and also the transaction costs of market buying or selling on GDAX to close the price discrepancy. Polo is trading at a discount right now and very few sell orders are on the book at GDAX. Most of the rises in ETH have been slowed by the large amount of supply on the sell book at GDAX.

His tax plan has a higher deficit than the Clinton plan both plans increase the deficit. He says things racist sexist jingoistic. He behaves like a petulant child. He didnt know what NBC means.

If the value does not drop for whatever reasons the people who took positions out are at risk and an increase in the price could cause all the people shorting the stock to close their position to limit their losses.

M over  years so you would have a constant flow of .M  M per month. but if we have a constant flow of ICO those number of companies add up... TLDR   the current pace of ICO if it continues is unsustainable there is not enough money in the system and the more it goes it will create a lot of pending supply that the market will find more and more difficult to absorb,ethtrader,d8ymadr,2,t5_37jgj

I very nearly gave up on submitting my vote when I was required to prove that I am not a robot ...to a robot. Not that Im unfamiliar with googles verification or mentally challenged but my time is better spent doing productive things such as ranting on reddit. My human task this time was to select all shopfront images from a list of  building thumbnail images which was simple enough and I won the battle. However the battle wasnt over yet! Other building images appeared in place of the selected shopfronts and I had to keep clicking. I realised there was no difinitive end to this challenge but I persisted.

9530154,0,t3_5bclqj,I helped come up with the model its my personal opinion that its better than the others that have been tried so far including the Ethereum sales decreasing discount no cap mechanism and the cap and finish in  min approach. The problem with the former is that participants have little certainty about valuation the problem with the latter is that it rewards those who are lucky enough to get in and inevitably leaves many people out. The decreasing cap model gives participants certainty over the valuation without pricefixing it  the optimal strategy for a participant who thinks a fair valuation is X is to wait until the valuation drops to X and then immediately buy. If they get in they will be happy they got in if the sale closes with a valuation above X they will be happy that they avoided what they think is a speculative bubble. Theres also the fairness benefit that everyone pays the same price.,ethtrader,d9nsj4f,29,t5_37jgj

9638056,0,t1_da12b42,I dont think so. People using BTC or actually hodling btc just want to make money. It really is a gold of cryptocurrency. Whenever BTC price is pumping altcoins holders are selling everything because they want to be on this wave. For bitcoiners Ethereum is an altcoin. So ETH price probably would drop.However there are two kinds of people imo that holds ether. The first one is bitcoiners. They pump and dump because they want to make money. They are the reason why the ether price drops sometimes. The second type is the etherfans who want ether because its not only better than btc ether is just good while btc is just bad. These people wont dump because they know that ether is not a dumb brick and it might be very useful. It already is but only on a small scale. Ethereum on reddit has the strongest community besides udrawingthesun ofc but sometimes the strong community that is devoted might not be enough. Even if Ethereum will be improved it might get crushed under the BTC that would hit lets say . or more. Its also possible that someday Ethereum will eat Bitcoin for breakfast but it definitely wont happen in the nearest future.Yeah well thats just like my opinion man.,ethtrader,da137rm,2,t5_37jgj

9705223,0,t1_da9cin4,Once upon a time ETH XMR and BTC were highly illiquid too with low trading volumes. Compared to Apple Google and Exxon they still are.Im just calling out growers in advance. Its a bit like trying to explain bitcoins potential to a general stock analyst in  theyll throw the same argument as you and its not a great one.Its actually a shit argument when you really think it through since even in an illiquid market as long as demand is present buyers will match sellers and price stability will be quickly established. I am repeatedly seeing this on the SDC charts where any drop of  cents is now getting quickly recovered and raised again by buyer demand.Most alts are shit. Sdc is not and Ive repeatedly explained in depth why already. Perhaps Ill sum it up into their reddit thread someday and post. Alternatively for now feel free to browse my post history. If you want to do TA on established coins and ride the waves of high volume volatility thats fine but right now that leaves you with  extremely boring options to trade with  of which are highly unpredictable and possibly bearish and  which is bearish. There are better more featured  platforms with greater use case emerging than xmr SDC is the most obvious one. You might notice I dont mention  of alts out there. Ive looked at them and decided theyre not worth my time. I can see you have a different level of risk aversion to me. Thats fine I hold more often than I trade. For the record SDC is still early and underpriced IMO  of buyers are now rightfully staking which is reducing available trading volumes further and driving up demand. It operates on traditional supply  demand economics and is actually much closer to deflationary in nature than bitcoin claims to be.Those economics will resonate with some people whose demographic that cryptocurrency largely uncaters too which is saving.DGD is probably overpriced but there was clearly large early trading volume and the bag holders who bought above  USD dont appear very willing to sell.Ive also been right more than Ive been wrong. Charts support me on SDC.XMR is heavily manipulated as are all PoW coins which inherently lack true price stability or predictable growth.,ethtrader,da9dkqo,4,t5_37jgj
9708719,0,t3_5e2sqq,gt Ether correlated positively with Gold... The investors are trading Ether more like a rare commodity whereas Bitcoin is traded more like a currencygt Ether is used as a form of exchange within this wider network called Ethereum. Bitcoin on the other hand is a currency unencumbered by any overall networks it is part of.Bitcoin may be a currency for darknets but believing it could actually ever become a central currency is so far removed from reality that I find it a bit laughable. They have the wrong base assumption and therefore come to the wrong conclusion.Saying ETH is a more risky asset than BTC over  years is foolish in my opinion because in  years legislation will come into play. Innovation will start to crumble even more in Bitcoinland whereas Ethereum has set it self up for longterm success and growth see below. We have the political foundation that allows us to tackle legislative challenges. Bitcoin lacks clear leadership and will not be able to transition to a PoS model. . We have the perfect consensus algorithm to avoid penalties by governments. . Our future is not dependent on a single usecase. Bitcoins success is entirely dependent on its function as a store of value. However instead of complaining about BTC lets take a look at ETHs strength Our success can come in many forms Asset exchanges and Dapps are just part of the equation. Ethereum can find success in many niches including new forms of VC and is therefore intrinsically considerably less risky than BTC over a  year period.,ethtrader,da9t3t1,6,t5_37jgj

9782240,0,t1_daiso7t,Make up your own mind. The price could move lower. Or it could rise. Ultimately it is your call  Quite a few of the doomers on here confidently predicting  ethereum over an equally confident timeframe also are predicting incredibly high prices in latter . The exact same BS bitcoin experienced during the bear market..Once you realise that this subreddit is largely people stating their own positions as predictions then it becomes easier to navigate.My personal view is that taking a loss is sometimes a good lesson in weighting your trades and it seems you are quite underwater with this one. With regard to bitcoin every single time I got caught out in a huge trapped long I managed to get out of it eventually  but you then carry the stress of that position plus the daily interest and in the end it might just be better to eat the loss and move on. Whilst I knew bitcoin would bounce back the same may not be true for ethereum  although I would still make a strong prediction it will bounce back very hard. There is so much development and projects going on in the space that is highly likely to translate to a further web euphoric rally at some stage.Just be prepared for the market to do the opposite of what you expect  if you sell it will rally if you dont it will test you further!It is when sentiment is at its worst that counter intuitively it is the best time to accumulate a position and the worst time to close a long position  assuming ethereum has real value and a future as a value store. Incidentally the much promulgated theory that ethereum needs to find mainstream value and a killer dapp for the price to rise is really silly i am still waiting for bitcoin to go mainstream lol. The market is entirely controlled by a few large players painting the tape currently down. Remember that news flow is used to justify price action by humans it doesnt cause it  despite what many believe  when the price is falling everything is a major problem or insurmountable obstacle.. Just as for bitcoin when big players have accumulated then the price will rebound. Remember when someone dumps k into the order books to smash the price they are not selling their coins to obtain best price they are doing so do to  cascade the price lower.. Ask yourself this   who is buying the coins?.  of traders lose money..leverage in general makes you roll the dice and lose that much quicker and take magnified losses..,ethtrader,daivial,3,t5_37jgj

This can only mean  we need to have some utility in place or some very clear TA indication to bring buyers back in for the long term to HODL!  We need new long term investors. the DAO burned investor will never come back untill we break a new ATH..In the meanwhile now we are just switching ETH back and forth with the same traders.The Bear will continue new price discovery will bring us to  Euros were we will bottomhopefully not lower than that  Thats my prediction. dark times ahead....,ethtrader,db846x7,6,t5_37jgj

10020313,0,t1_dbdnmv5,Stratis is a weird animal. Its gone x since ICO a few months ago. The developers are very active and the community is constantly hyping. Its billed as a blockchain for business and supposedly this ties into businesses building sidechains off of STRAT. I have difficulty seeing the value in the Stratis chain as there is no compelling innovation that warrants its existence that I can see. The white paper lists the  standard blockchain use cases proof of existence and settlementremittance. That hasnt stopped it from delivering great returns though and to be frank Im a little bit baffled by this one. If the uptrend continues Ill probably invest regardless of what I think of the tech.NXCBeyond the Void. I invested in the ICO and was amazed when Polo listed this. Its very similar to BCY in potential appreciation and the game they are building is much more popular targeting the competitive esports MOBA crowd.  sats its still x ICO with  or  months till the release of the game so not a great buy currently. ,ethtrader,dbdoatx,4,t5_37jgj

Price parity is completely meaningless.ETC people dream of some magical inversion of users and developers that they think would happen.  But its just not reality.Everybody on the ETH side has moved on.In relatively short order there will be hardforks for ETH Metropolis etc.  that ETC wont and cant due to developer incompetence be able to merge in.At that point theyll be drifting on the open ocean all alone for as far as the eye can see.

10067742,0,t1_dbjtf9k,Bitcoin has recently proven to be a good store of value. It seems to me that the risk of a falling yuan should increase the interest in commodities not depending on yuan. China is big and you only need a small fraction of interest in bitcoin to have a big effect.When the value of yuan stabilizes money will move out from bitcoin again. A falling bitcoin will make many investors rebalance moving funds to ether.All this means that there may be a positive correlation between the value of yuan and the value of ether.,ethtrader,dbjulr5,3,t5_37jgj

10071425,0,t3_5jlxtj,Since you are answering questions could you point to an EL on how the time based money holds stable value while still being economically efficient.  How are unequally valued services One hour of cleaning  One hour of legal advice exchanged? There is a mention on your website about using reputation which makes some sense as it would work as a kind of automatic negotiation of rates but can you expand on the mechanics of the rating system? If it is star ratings then that would not be expected to lead to economically efficient relative valuations. If it is a mechanism which allows scarce resources to increase their price then there is a risk it will collapse into becoming a currency without enforced value and loses its peg.  If it is openly traded how is the value protected against speculators and shorters?  How is money supply controlled? What are the feedback mechanisms?,ethtrader,dbkbuzu,1,t5_37jgj

10196856,0,t1_dbzifhb,Price will spike fast when the release goes out.  Waiting for the . release to buy probably isnt a great strategy for DGD.An interesting thing about Digix is that it seems to be held back because it is held to higher standards than other crypto.  Nobody is expecting really anything out of tens of other highercap cryptos.  But Digix is expected to produce something real and since there is actually something valuable forthcoming theres a perceived value differential that makes it worth less than the others.

It is much more profitable to trade based on d charts rather than the short timeframes you are trading at. In this particular instance the downtrend was broken several days ago and further gains were are to be expected in the coming days coupled with the bearish BTC news this gave me the confidence to hold through the dips on margin. Of course your approach is fine too because you risk less but due to trading fees and losses you incur less profitable.

Luckily people are not that stupid. Nor is anyone in the cryptosphere that stupid except from the ones who have interests in making Ethereum look stupid.

10882465,0,t3_5veaa2,Other than avoiding chokepoints as mentioned above is there anything intrinsic about how the DAI is programmed and balanced that might make it a better choice than a simple dollartoken in some applications?No.If a dollarcoin exists from a major financial institution on ethereum it will be very popular. Lots of dapps in development are targeting regular people as customers and they will want to transact in something like dollars. Do you think any business is going to want to explain what Maker is and then what a DAI is AND THEN what an SDR is and then what the IMF is just so  their customer can understand what the heck they got in exchange for their Credit Card deposit? Heck no. They will say heres a Santander Dollar its just like a dollar. And their customer will think ok cool.I do however see to reasons for blockchain native stablecoins to exist. Not everyone wants their fiat currency wealth tied to the stability of the banking system Iran the paranoid the people of Cyprus right before their banking system collapsed et al. An SDRlinked asset gives you a unique ability to not speculate on the price of ether or bitcoin or something else while still having your assets completely cutoff from the banking system. thats an advantage over gold for some people. The only way to keep your wealth tied to fiat without speculating on the price of something else is to hide it under your mattress. MKR solves some of the obvious problems associated with that method.. Umbilical cord dollarcoins may never come to ethereum. I dont understand the regulatory environment around setting up a dollar coin but if it was easy it would already exist. Im hoping it comes soon but who knows? Maybe Santander dollars wont ever happen. ,ethtrader,de2g66e,2,t5_37jgj

But if Ethereum succeeds in getting a strong enough network effect of actual usage ETH will meet the criteria for being valuable  It will be useful for various things. Its not easy or economically feasible to replace with any single thing for all the uses it has Its technically suitable to be a store of value.Number two is where Bitcoin differs from gold for example if it wont be used for payments.

Sure if the ETF is denied that will cause a short term crash and delay the bubble but if approved I think the bubble will take off.There has been tons of new moneyusers coming into crypto in the last year or so. Additionally media coverage has been steadily increasing and many governments are mentioning and talking about Bitcoin. Purely anecdotal but Bitcoin is a topic that is coming up in general conversation more and more in my own experience.I just think a new bubble is inevitable and with all the new focus on BTC its going to be crazy.

10908721,0,t3_5vp1zn,So heres my take on the next few weeksmonths. Scenario  ETF gets approved bitcoin keeps pumping for a few more weeks makes a new ATH could be anywhere from  before a significant correction happens. In the meantime the ETHBTC ratio will suffer and go further down however I believe the further we go down the more resilient the ratio will be become which will lead to a further increase in ETH fiat price. Scenario  ETF gets rejected bitcoin crashes hard! When news of the ETH rejection hits bitcoin will plummet and could do down to the s or ever lower. All issues and they are numerous in BTC have not been solved at all and the infighting will reach new heights again. For ETH this will mean the ratio ETHBTC will pump hard! Initially during the dump days to  or  weeks after the announcement ETH fiat price will suffer as well but not nearly as much as Bitcoin. I can see a possibility where we spike to below  USD prices but we wont be there for long. Ethereum has a lot going for it currently and these will help decoupling us from bitcoin and the start of the much talked about flippening. Next week will have the Enterprise Ethereum announcement begging of March there is the first live version of Raiden light? new news on Swarm ENS and of course more news on Metropolis. Ethereum has started a new bull run with a lovely valentines special and will see how far well go in the coming months. This year we should see some major projects going live on Ethereum and in the later stages of the year the Casper hype should begin! Its going to be one hell of a year ladies and gentlemen! So my advice to traders who want to margin trade ETH next few weeks be in ETHUSD if Bitcoin ETF gets approved and be in ETHBTC if bitcoin ETF gets rejected. ,ethtrader,de55o75,3,t5_37jgj

The majority of people who actually hold gold do so as a hedge or to fight off inflation over the long run. Gold tends to attract hoarders and speculators not spenders. Trying to convince  year olds they can now buy real gold online and spend it in a shop to buy small purchases is not something I see happening at all. ,ethtrader,de6g8p9,4,t5_37jgj

Our web portals to register needed to connect with KYC and purchasing. We had a significant amount of traffic and the integrated platforms werent communicating well in a live format. We are working to streamline the entire process with a more simplified approach. KYC has been a major hurdle and we have been thinking through the issues to make sure we can have a successful launch. As we all know a successful token sale depends on clarity of the platform transparency momentum and most of all  Trust. We spoke with our advisors and major investors the day of the sale after the issues we had and their recommendation was to stop the sale return the funds and regroup which is exactly what we did. We listen to our advisors and we have a very strong plan to move forward that well announce very soon. What were attempting to achieve is new and we realize the market needs to be confident in our approach. One thing we dont do is quit after a setback. Never give up. Never surrender. ,ethtrader,deh8q4w,1,t5_37jgj

11084934,0,t3_5yafkd,  you can hear Vitalik say it.What we need to know as traders is when these kind of events happen. A next release of the Ethereum platform is a huge event that moves the price big time.So Vitalik suggests the end of june but it depends if some other stuff is ready for it so maybe it will be  or  months later. IMO the most likely case will be between the end of june and the end of august.There is just one way to play this event which is buy and hold till at least the Metropolis release. As we saw with previous releases as well in other crypto projects the price starts to gain way before the release actually takes place. The hype starts before and not after. So get in while you can  To me its a nobrainer. It will be hard for the price of ETH to trade lower during the Metropolis launch than current prices. IMO the only way it would trade lower around those dates is if there would be a black swan event which is unlikely to happen.So in short buy as much as you can and hold till at least Metropolis ,ethtrader,deogu9n,4,t5_37jgj

I think there is a distinction between the oldskool Bitcoin and todays Bitcoin.Oldskool Bitcoin the Bitcoin we owe a lot to is actually the Bitcoin that most of us have been praising ourselves in the past few years. Thats our Bitcoin its the Bitcoin that many of us made big. We owe it not to Bitcoin but basically to ourselves.The new Bitcoin or more precisely the modern Bitcoin community... we dont owe them shit. They have been trashing Ethereum attacking Ethereum. Not just Ethereum but also the oldskool Bitcoin and they have misguided Bitcoin into a direction that many of us no longer feel comfortable with thats why we moved onto Ethereum in the first place.Thats the bigger picture here. So Im not really gonna be sad about any kind of failure because its what they have brought upon themselves after hijacking the beautiful idea in the first place.I think thats also what is causing the general negative sentiment towards Bitcoin lately its a feeling that more people have. ,ethtrader,desfu2b,8,t5_37jgj

Bitcoin has trailblazed the path for future crypto. A B market cap or a k coin does not feel unreasonable anymore not saying ETH will hit B during this rally though.. Super easy fiat onramps..

11225734,0,t1_df4er2i,Theres also the fact that its really unclear what ETHs longterm value really is within the Ethereum ecosystem. Like how scarce is ETH really going to be and how will that affect its value? Right now its value is being driven by speculation but its not exactly clear what were speculating on. Buying ETH isnt like owning stock as were not actually buying shares of a company. I also think youre somewhat overvaluing the EEA. Its a small consortium of business representatives. Thats it. By no means does it guarantee that the worlds financial networks are going to switch to Ethereum. Maybe in a year or two the EEA realize that they cant really make it work because its too hard to actually socially engineer a global shift to a new technology and that opposing forces are too strong. You do realize how big of a challenge that is right? Or maybe better technology comes along? Who knows? There are lots of unknowns and risks major injury or worse to Vitalik etc..

11254867,0,t1_df7or6u,I truly understand where youre coming from but there are some serious issues with that thinking now. First is that there is nothing about Ethereum that stops it from being a currency and store of value. Arguments can be made that it is at least just as safe as bitcoin given it has nearly the same PoW value now discussed recently on rEthereum and the twitter sphere. Also even though Bitcoin is accepted by place all over the world there are very very few places relative to the market that accepts bitcoin. For example in my city of medium size not a single local store. So if you have less than  of the potential market and some upstart has  it doesnt take much to take over. Especially if your token is already seeing more traction among mainstream industry which clearly Ethereum is.All in all the sub can sound like Bitcoin haters which is frustrating. I think the reality is that Ethereum in its history has been regularly shit upon by Bitcoin maximalists creating a defensive posture. Now that Ethereum is emerging as superior technology with a new network effect unreachable to bitcoin in its current protocol Dapps with even superior properties as a currency than Bitcoin Ethereum folks are tired on the nonsense. Also as previous or current bitcoin holders as many of us are the governance issues of Bitcoin has exhausted our patience especially given Ethereum is now a superior alternative.,ethtrader,df7q0b7,10,t5_37jgj

Demo mobile app  Of course it is too basic at the moment and that is the reason we are heading toward an ICO there is only certain amount of things we are able to show you at the moment without any funding...as our primary goal a lot of design and features will be brought to the mobile app.. Regarding decentralization and usage of the blockchain I think thats just not true...we have implemented a blockchain ecosystem for our internally used token we use Uport in order to encrypt our user data on top of the blockchain our whole platform is built on top of Smart contracts without any meddling so basically you cant take the two apart....,ethtrader,df964tz,2,t5_37jgj
11268304,0,t1_df8z2dy,Ultimately were building Status for the general public but therell be a number of market segments that well focus on first as we work towards this goal not to mention Ethereums network needs to be ready for this first.The logical progression from the Ethereum community would be to the greater crypto space followed by privacy conscious groups and libertarian groups. While this is far from mass adoption the success of apps like Signal and Telegram each with tens of millions of users and whose core marketing messaging is privacy serves as a testament to how deeply this resonates with a small but growing percentage of the population in many markets.Beyond this we can begin creating custom marketing campaigns and custom onboarding sequences into Status for specific DApps we believe we can get users for. Its worth noting here from a user acquisition perspective there are only a few key metrics  retention rates are the big one early on and realtime bidding platforms DSPs make this very much a data driven approach. In our experience once you find some pockets of high converting users you can scale very quickly.Looking further ahead Id love to see Status bringing access to financial tools and services to emerging markets but these are complex problems and often mobile data costs are a hurdle to adoption. I suspect this would require working more closely with communities and mobile carriers which also were prepared to do.,ethtrader,df98ul1,2,t5_37jgj

11322893,0,t1_dffdp19,No.  Raiden is an offchain network that ultimately settles onchain.  As an analogy think of going to a bar and starting a tab by putting up a credit card as escrow.  You order many drinks and the tab is kept offchain.  When you go to leave the bartender charges your credit card for the amount you owe.  You settle up.  The final charge is to your credit card for the amount owed onchain.  Im not as familiar with Sharding but it sounds more like having many Ethereum chains running in sync and linked together but any one transaction only needs to be broadcast to one chain and not ran on every single node of the network. So basically its onchain scailing. Im sure someone will eviscerate my limited understanding of this. Feel free to do so Im still learning as well. ,ethtrader,dfffja1,12,t5_37jgj

BUT Can you point me to some place where we said  of the tokens will be kept by the devs? WITHOUT adding something like a minimum? IF we ever did this I would SINCERELY APOLOGIZE.I can at least point you to MANY places where we phrased it correctly  FAQ including a link to a detailed overview of the price  announcement overview post  in our initial post a few month ago introducing the auctionFor those confused now I copy this from our FAQHOW WILL THE TOKEN AUCTION WORK?There are two great articles up on our blog post that explain the token launch in some detail Introducing the Gnosis Token Launch and Why so complicated?.Of the M GNO in total up to M GNO will be sold during the token auction. We use a modified dutch auction mechanism. This essentially means the value of each token will start out ridiculously high and slowly get cheaper over time. Participants place a bid at the maximum value they are comfortable with and the token auction ends when one of two conditions is met .M worth of ETH is contributed or M GNO tokens are sold.EVERYONE PAYS THE SAME PRICE! No matter when you place a bid you will pay the same price as every other participant. For those that bid early this means you will get more tokens for you contribution than you originally expected for your contribution.So what happens if .M is contributed before M GNO tokens are sold? Any excess tokens not sold during the token launch will be held by the team and used to support and grow the gnosis ecosystem.Regarding the use of unsold tokens a more precise official statement will come in the next days.,ethtrader,dg0yuyu,2,t5_37jgj

Each subsequent day a smaller percentage is offered. Im low end techie .... probably choose MEW as my bidding interphase. From what I have researched about the Dutch auction  the purpose is to offer the asset at a price higher than the seller expects to receive but when price is accepted  the buyer could simply buy all of the asset on the first day? Unclear how it will be staggered out over  days. Looks like the auction may last as long as bidsseller come to terms and the  day chart is just a theoretical limit. The point of the Dutch approach is to give the market and the seller some time to meeting of minds. How likely can we expect the auction to last more  days? Can the price ONLY drop after each subsequent day?Maybe the auctions can last only hours or a day or two?Lots of questions ..... I know .... ,ethtrader,dgl7ijj,0,t5_37jgj

11749555,0,t1_dgrtg9y,I dont know ow if anyone can truly verify but thats how every bank exchange and auction house has worked in the entire world in their existence. Obviously all the ones we mentioned have several regulations to kind of put limits on what they can and cant do with your money. Banks invest your money and make profit from it but they need to have certain liquid reserves as well just like your money is FDIC insured. in the us. In the case of kraken idk which h regulations or if any apply to it. Best case scenario it would be regulated like an trading platform or a bank who h both allow to invest certain amount of money. Worst case there is no regulation  and they can do whatever they want. Let the free market decide whats good. One of the reasons Uphold had solvency issues some time ago. So I dont have proof of what kraken does with the money but its a safe bet that they do partake in buying and selling of coins and tokens and arent just a peer to peer marketplace. Also in the Gnosis slack it was stated that they didnt sell GNO tokens to kraken after the auction ended so the tokens they are offering must be from their own reserves or someone selling their tokens through kraken before they are listed. ,ethtrader,dgruaw1,1,t5_37jgj

This is a type of thinking that is less prevalent here than in bitcoin subreddits.There are some people here that do not understand why the bitcoin price is still rising with all that is going on. This means they do not want to invest in it and rather invest in Ethereum where there is more upside. Still they are surprised seeing a new btc ath.And people who do hate bitcoin do so I think because of the community and hence the stalemate. The two main subreddits have a lot of postscomments that are solely bashing the other side in the debate. To me it looks like it has become a religion to some bitcoiners and others have to be destroyed. Rational debate is hard to find sometimes. Add to that the people who think every altcoin should not exist and voice their opinion very harshly.

In the past any major crash in BTC or ETH has been created by a black swan event not a true bubble pop since being somewhat mainstream. In BTC it was the Gox closure that caused the first run up to collapse and then general district by the public in exchanges and incorrectly the tech. In ETH it was the DAO hack. It took awhile to recover reputation. Blockchain tech is now becoming mainstream and more people are learning about it by the day. Theres no justifiable reason outside of future black swans to think we will collapse economically for no reason because there are lots of people who think they missed the boat waiting to buy at cheaper prices of which that gets higher by the day. The dot com bubble was due to companies with no real worth being valued too high. To me that in crypto are all the altsICOs getting high valuations with no justification.

11797211,0,t1_dgx95da,Heres a sneak peek of reth using the top posts of the year! People are leaving crypto en masse because of bitcoins small blocks and slow confirmation times. With Eth having much quicker confirmations its time we start letting people know that the nd biggest crypto is good not just for dapps but everyday transactions as well.   Is anyone interested in starting a campaign for eths use as more of a transactional currency? Sort of similar to how bitcoin is being used for basic transactions. Transaction times are much faster so I feel like a lot of people would be really receptive.

11797594,0,t1_dgx9zrz,It was beautiful sobBut no didnt hear or see squat. When the SEC ruled against BTC I expected to read about it in the Financial Times but... Not even a peep. To most people Ethereum is going to come out of nowhere. ,ethtrader,dgxaq3l,1,t5_37jgj
11797944,0,t1_dgxbxou,I was around and in the crypto world a few months before and heard about the ICO but chose not to participate in it at the time with my . bitcoin. Oops. I likely wouldnt have held for this long thoughand wouldve cashed out fast for quick profits but still maybe I wouldve kept a few at . a pop. Sigh. ,ethtrader,dgxc5m4,5,t5_37jgj

11803010,0,t1_dgxwsbb,This is from the articleThe idea here is for EV cars themselves to be blockchenized and through smart contracts to automatically pay the charging station thus making the process quicker and more efficientOther than the blockchenized bullshit this is a payment channel or token transaction... Nothing to get excited about.The facts that overstock.com accepts BTC is more innovative than thus,ethtrader,dgxwul1,0,t5_37jgj

11804850,0,t3_68foz7,Great post. I cant offer a lot but here are some opinionsI fully believe that blockchain will run in the background in the future. ETH will never be an acceptable currency at least not in the US because if it ever got big the government would ban it from everyday use. Full stop. Im liberterian at heart I get the arguments from the bitcoin community. That doesnt change a damn thing. The US government controls our currency and with good reason. Regulating interest rates and controlling the monetary supply is a huge source of economic stability as well as power for our country. I dont want that to go away and the American government thankfully wont let it. I dont want to get in a flame war here on this issue since irrationality rules the day round these parts but suffice to say in  years our kids and grandkids will be using good ol USD to buy their McDonalds. Will that USD run on blockchain ethereum maybe? rails? Maybe. Im hoping yes.So if its running in the background whats stopping google from doing their own thing? Nothing. Its opensource. And as anyone that follows the opensource community knows corporations have been reaping the rewards of selfless opensource devs for decades. Why not? Who got rich of Linux? No one you say? Wrong shareholders of every massive company in the US benefited from its advent. The folks that pour years of their lives into these projects get no money. But they dont want it. They want notoriety. They want developer fame which is essentially lots of commits on Github for the coolest projects and conference talks. I should also mention that having a decent opensource presence helps in landing jobs so theres that. But for most of these people they develop for nonmonetary reasons. I dont get it Ive never gotten it and Im not sure I ever will. But Ethereum is different right?! Yes and no. The devs have tokens but the tech is still fully opensource. What would happen if Google came out today and announced Web . built with blockchain technology basically Ethereum. It makes the front page of every newspaper or at least the business and tech sections. The internet is evolving and Google is leading the charge. I think the Ethereum market cap disappears over night. And despite what network effect mumbo jumbo folks on this sub say I dont think Ethereum wins that war. We become a section on the Web . wiki page early days of Web .. Ethereum is literally talking about upending the internet. I promise you Google and others hyperledger anyone? has taken notice.To your regulation question the sooner Ethereum can get regulated the better. There is a space for unregulated coins but its small in comparison to the regulated alternative.To your point on banks and Visa I think blockchain will eventually power their networks. No doubt they have dozens if not hundreds of devs working on that problem right now. The hope is that they use Ethereum to do this. So when I buy a burger using my Visa at a local shop the USD is transferred from Visas bank to the shops bank using ethereum. Perhaps it converts to ETH moves and then converts back to USD instantaneously. Key take away here is that all of your concerns are valid. Nothing is a sure thing. The price rise is by definition pure speculation at this point. There is a long way to go. Oh and every cool project and company that joins EEA or buys an Ethereum startup cough Spotify is interested in private chains not public. Yes Im holding but this place has gotten way too irrational. Its turning into rwallstreetbets.,ethtrader,dgy4cp8,31,t5_37jgj
