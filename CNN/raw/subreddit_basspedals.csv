7370256,0,t3_4g8ws2,By far my favorite pedal I cant live without is a high pass filter.  I play in a loud genre stonerdoom rock.  I need every bit of volume I can get.,basspedals,d2fy3w1,4,t5_34le8
7477073,0,t3_4hqeqb,Cool demo. Good job of showing the full reach of the pedal with the different knobs. I think Darkglass  does a better job with their OD but this gives some great examples of what the Fuzz can do.Speaking of multiple fuzz sounds in one box I really prefer the Dwarfcraft Silver Rose. They run a Muff and a superfuzz parallel and each has independent volume and tone. Theres also an eq and a clean blend. Id like to hear you demo that as every clip Ive heard of it so far is very doomstoner plodding half notes and you tend to use busier lines.,basspedals,d2s3mil,2,t5_34le8

11658541,0,t1_dghhht0,That one is the JHS Lime Aid compressor. I dig it but apparently others didnt because its discontinued. For me its simple to use and fairly transparent tone wise for reasonable price.,basspedals,dghidmf,2,t5_34le8
