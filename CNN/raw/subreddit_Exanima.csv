5925935,0,t3_3szdwg,By working with your angle a h rusty sword can outrange a h metal pole or h sword or the billhook. I would also like to add that theres no gamey rules in Exanima that says all the weapon types are equally good in some way or that a short weapon has to be faster than a long one because of video game logic. Every weapon is what it is. You can make objective observations and conclude that some weapons are simply better than others by their success rate or propertiesMadoc said that the h is a better weapon than the h sword but the h sword gives you the benefit of having a free arm for a torch or a shield. Thats not over game balance but because thats the reasonable properties of the items without using any video game rules,Exanima,cxwf64t,1,t5_3836g

10637144,0,t1_ddd22sk,yes plate armor can take a beating as you saw none of the recruits died. And for me to get to master it took about  hrs or a lot of fights mostly duels and challengers ,Exanima,ddd51mr,2,t5_3836g
