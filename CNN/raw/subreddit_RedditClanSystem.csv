2357343,0,t3_2mc7kw,Reddits Angels is quite possibly the best clan I could hope for. Its full of excitement and character development and organization.For me I like to see a lot of diversity in the clan as far as conversational topics but we have a few that pop up more than others. We usually have a few members who like to go above and beyond regular donating and spam high level wizards Thx Alex! and reach near or over k for consecutive seasons. This led to a few recurring comments of players being frustrated that they cant spread their own philanthropy but it was all in good fun.There is also a common theme of a competitive upgrading trashtalking. Its surprising how many of us had upgraded to TH pretty much within the same week so we generally have bouts of Hey man where are those L archers Thx for reminding me x a day Xsdk only to be returned with oh I guess I couldnt see them past my L BK. You have a nice L BK tho. Probably pretty strong. This can go on between players as a weird dance of boasting about upgrade schedules but is super fun with everyone generally having a different focus on whats fun to them.We are also very diverse in nationality. Our leader KoolSkool suffers undue euphoria mlady when a fellow angel reveals they are from Canada him and Toybox start chanting no I dont understand it ao. But as a retort when hockey is mentioned I make sure to clarify that he is talking about ice hockey. Infuriation and laughs are had.Asunon a man well deserving of his own paragraph but shall be limited to a few sentences often posts mysterious Japanese characters that he knows only he will understand. WHY DO YOU DO THIS? Also Asunon is bae. Httpniceme.meI cant believe weve gotten this far without mentioning the war atmosphere. We have a borrowed system of claiming certain targets so that even our lowest levelled members can have a fair chance of attacking in their rank and spots fill up pretty quick. Recently our newly elected Coleader Amelia has started doing a few war reviews. This buzz filled the clan and Andyyy and myself have also decided to hop on the hype train and start making reviews. Sometimes we get guests from Sphinx to join us for a war or vice versa and everyones war expertise benefits. Though we have a lot of mid and late THs so many attacks are mass drags. Id say we are fairly all experts in that field now especially since we all witnessed a L drag attack go  on a mid TH base. Way to go Kevin!We also have a painfully active groupme chat. We recently requested that the  person limit be lifted so we can all circlejerk with maximum efficacy. Often we are able to post pics of attack drawings or whiteboard drawings of plans but more often it is filled with tomfoolery and general textbased roughhousing.A new member can expect to be flooded with welcomes just like in any other highly active clan. He or she can expect an immediate base review and suggestions on how to best fit in with the clan by way of our baller subreddit again thx xsdk donations and offthewallness.We have Training Mondays too. We dont like to keep poor attackers but everyone should have a chance to learn. A list is made of those who couldnt three star a base along with strategy failures and a specific learning plan is laid out for everyone. Everyone is encouraged to discuss strategy and it is showing as a great way to develop players and ease us into golembased attacks or better use of balloons.Maybe another member could elaborate on some more intricacies of the clan as we have many. Reddit Angels is so much fun to be in for me and the group of people that have amassed in the clan truly make it a unique and stimulating experience.,RedditClanSystem,cm32tup,17,t5_32un4
2358235,0,t3_2mc7kw,Reddit Oak is awesome! I love that eWe accept every type of player and there is no pressure to be addicted to the game. I have become a casual player when it comes to attacking but I still check in and donate a few times a day. Oak is perfect for this because the focus is to have fun  and be a friendly community instead of focusing on attacking as much as possible. However we still go all out in our seasonal war.TLDR Being friendly gt being addicted and anyone is welcome. Our players range from a lvl  th to a lvl  th ,RedditClanSystem,cm36she,4,t5_32un4
