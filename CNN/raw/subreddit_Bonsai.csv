675262,0,t3_21u9a0,Just FYI  its not the air that makes the roots grow fine in those pots its the light from the perforated pond basket.   The roots reach the edge of the pot and instead of circling around like they do in a solid container where it is dark they try to grow through the holes  at which point they hit light and die back.

839298,0,t3_23qa7l,That is a nice looking Rhododendrum. Im not sure about the fork in the trunk some people say its not a good design but if you like it just go ahead. utreehause s indication is very good. Note that he has focused on cutting branches that cross others you should generally remove branches that start from an outward pointing branch and are directed towards the interior of the tree. Also you should always budget to kill the tree if its too expensive you might be too cautious in making the necessary cuts.And one final advice beware of cutting too many low branches and ending up with pompoms,Bonsai,cgzoiuy,4,t5_2qowd
871414,0,t3_243wyb,The tree is too juvenile in my opinion. It has the shape of a tree because of the foliage but the trunk is so thin and there arent really any branches to create the structure of a believable image of an old tree. ,Bonsai,ch3c189,2,t5_2qowd

It did not start as an art and each bonsai artist started as a technician capable of growing a tree and not killing it. Only after sufficient technique and basics of treecare are maintained does the possibility of art become available.Think of it like a pyramid. Basic plant care is at the base techniques and modifications in the middle and artistic merit at the peak. All levels are valuable please educate your fellow green thumbs instead of insulting them.

930061,0,t1_ch9zp2g,Okay Yep I see the root you are talking about. I think it should be removed as well. Maybe even without having to really see much more of the base.  The ideal timing  will coincide with the removal of the sucker used to thicken the base like this  Let the sucker grow for lets say two complete growing seasons. In the spring of the third year remove the sucker leaving a really good stub of an inch or two. Dont let the stub sprout new foliage rub off any new bud that form. Next spring remove the large root. During the growing season of the year you removed the major root trim the dried stub to whatever you think is appropriate.   Edit forgot the reason for this baroque approach. The reason you do stuff like this in distinct stages with azaleas or pretty much anything in the Ericaceae family heaths heathers is to avoid a condition called sap withdrawal. ,Bonsai,cha03hu,2,t5_2qowd
930316,0,t1_cha0wm6,Yeah you got my question dependent on health of the tree and best to remove in stages. As for the knob I was talking about up high not down low.

Ill try and get a better pic tonight. I guess it could be a moot point based on how low I chop it back eventually. I obviously dont have a plan yet so Im just thinking on my feet.

973057,0,t1_chew3uw,You made it seem like youre trying to fit allot into a season. So my personal suggestion would to get it repot in some decent bonsai soil. You will see the roots when you do it so you can decide to trim or not then. If its very root bound youll have to cut some more roots and comb it all out. If its not too root bound loosen it all up trim some from the bottom then let it thrive until next year. Then a trunk chop is in order only if it thrived though. If not wait another season as it is and chop the following. No point in working on that leggy foliage and branches now if they will be gone in a few.,Bonsai,chew9bo,1,t5_2qowd

Even then its usually a bonsai shaped training pot but nothing fancy.  In the meantime they are in the ground or in a  gallon or more pot depending on the plant size and size of the root ball.  Some of mine that are are entering the mid stages of development where I just need finer branching I have reduced to not much bigger than what you have now.  If you give the roots more room to grow youll see faster development most likely.  Especially if the tree is already filling the pot with roots.,Bonsai,chg4390,1,t5_2qowd

1120187,0,t1_chvmgb7,It was very crowded and in need of pruning even were I not attempting to shape it which I am primarily doing to keep the tree portable.Im aware that its not really right for traditional root over rock and its roots dont really seem conducive to it so it may never happen but by jove Id like to give it a shot. There are a couple big roots Id like to at least have exposed eventually with perhaps pebbles to snake around.Thats not really what its called it doesnt have a name as far as I suppose. This works really well on mature wood cuttings from grapes and Im just seeing if it works for mature cuttings from other trees though this is my first attempt.You store the cuttings in the fridge with some moist papertowels in a ventilated freezer bag. You want to use some hydrogen peroxide on the towels to prevent molding and you want to change the towels out every once in a while. Not wet just moist or youll rot stuff.The refrigeration puts the cuttings into dormancy and in that state they can slowly grow the beginnings of roots which can end up pretty thick by the time youre ready to plant them.Its not the usual way to propagate olive cuttings but I dont have access to rootstock at the moment.,Bonsai,chvmj7p,1,t5_2qowd

1397231,0,t3_2a2izq,EDIT After watching that Id like to remind the less experienced readers to never NEVER remove all the dirt by blasting it with a high pressure hose. Root hairs are fragile microscopic structures they recover quickly but it is wholly avoidable damage with a bucket of water and a root hook. I tried potting sphagnum and peat moss when I started. Rots within a few months somewhat expensive and highly absorbent not a positive quality. Also harvesting sphagnum is somewhat environmentally unfriendly which is just another nail in the coffin.Moss soils are used heavily in propagation by nurseries so he isnt wrong in saying that they have merits. Personally Ive found they dont perform well for developing or potting bonsai.,Bonsai,cirf9kx,3,t5_2qowd

You should be a mod!Not a mod just a dedicated lurker. gt Im glad I didnt land myself a tropical one if you seem to find them tricky Id be in a bit of a jam!Tropicals are actually quite easy in some ways its just the wintering isnt as low maintenance as the temperate trees. My cold weather trees require very little maintenance from December through March other than occasionally checking to make sure they havent dried out. My tropicals require a semiheated room and the winter air can dry them out pretty quickly sometimes if Im not paying attention. Not particularly hard just requires more vigilance.,Bonsai,cixm9du,1,t5_2qowd
1446858,0,t1_civt76c,My ficus almost never go dormant because I keep them in a green house with heat it isnt necessary.  Im in Philadelphia too. And I think you could defoliate these guys three or four times a season and they would just keep coming. Ficus in the tropics can get burnt badly a few times a summer and drop a ton of leaves and keep pushing growth so I dont think it really is next years leaves in the case of tropical ficus. Just my opinion though,Bonsai,cixn1n6,1,t5_2qowd
1449392,0,t1_cixy7nx,Ficus and chinese elm are regular trees and will get quite large in the right environment.

2141809,0,t1_clc28kn,Yes you can slip pot it now. The new pot should only be just big enough to accommodate the current root ball. Ideally you would only have  of new space in the new pot surrounding all surfaces of the current root ball top bottom  sides. The tree is currently in soil so i would make your new medium a coarse mix of potting soil. Bark perlite haydite granite grit etc are all suitable amendments to the soil. Perlite is the most readily available any garden center will have it so Ill assume that. Its usually dusty so you can do a dry sift with a cheap kitchen colander or strainer or a sifter if you have one. You can mix any of these in soil up to . Mix it in a bucket. Take your new pot and add some mix in for the base pull your tree directly out of the current pot without messing with the roots place it in the new pot add your mix around the sides and then cover the top. Water top down until you see water coming out of the drainage holes.If you do this you could repot fully in  but I would probably wait and do it in . Bonsai is a waiting game its why I have  things in development. The current soil looks pretty compacted which is not good but in my experience when you slip pot into better soil the old root ball will start to loosen up so I wouldnt be overly concerned about it. Messing with the roots too soon or before you know what youre doing or when the tree is not very healthy is the  way beginners kill trees. ,Bonsai,clc2l9f,1,t5_2qowd

Also If you take a look on the bottom right there seems to be a thin branch coming out of a much thicker taper not thought of?? and it just hangs there with a few leaves. The branch looks much much younger than its predecessor so it looks unbalanced. These are my observations and I could go on but I am a noob so TFWIW.

Unless something that takes this much abuse recovers and thrives it doesnt exactly give me a warm fuzzy feeling about trying this on my own trees.

I have a Chinese Elm scurve  yeah I know... that I have brought inside for the winter due to extreme temps in my location.  It sits by a southern facing window gets great light away from any heat radiators.Problem is that it has been dropping about  of its leaves on an almost cyclical basis only to regrow them a couple weeks afterward in beautiful healthy fashion.  It has done this three times since I brought it inside last October and is now dropping them once again.  I first thought it might just be getting adjusted to spending a winter season indoors and figuring out its new environment but something seems wrong.  Im fairly disciplined with watering every  to  days depending on moisture feel but I wont deny that it may have got a bit too dry on a couple of occasions.  Unfortunately Im a bit too scatterbrained to recall if these occasions corresponded to when the leaves started dropped.

3944927,0,t1_cr5y3jt,Yes you can rewire it. The main thing about wiring an entire tree is that sometimes the fine feeder roots take a beating as you move the tree around so that is something to be careful with making sure the tree stays stable. You shouldnt need to cut the branch on a tree like this. A quick way to test if your wire is strong enough is to hold out about a  length of wire and push the branch down into the position you want with the end of the wire. If the branch bends and the wire doesnt you are good. If its the other way around get a heavier wire. ,Bonsai,cr5yeo0,3,t5_2qowd

Sometime it was sunny over the day then no sun for a cuple of days and now its very sunny the whole day. The Zelkova gets full sun all day at its position. Now some leaves are turning red likethis and this Does it gets to much sun after a period of not so much sun and do i have to protect the new growth for to much sun? Second Question I have a fukien Tea for about  months now. Due to the changeable wether I put it outside when the temperatures are high enough and put it inside when its to cold. Is it capable to bear full sun for a whole day or would i burn it because its not used to it?Thanks in advance! ,Bonsai,crv8upw,1,t5_2qowd

I realize its a little too late to repot them now but will they survive in the pots and soil they came in? Some look to be a little rootbound.

4235170,0,t1_cs2wdd0,Jeez theres nothing wrong with grafting. Werent you the one who wanted people to be more precise when talking about it being impossible to grow trees indoors? I feel like its the same thing here.  of white pines are grafted onto black pine stock. Cork bark pines are typically grafted. Weaker JM cultivars are normally grafted onto stronger rootstock which if done properly can be used for bonsai.The problem with these ficus trees isnt specifically that theyre grafted although people should be aware of that. Its because theyre immature material and dont look like a tree. Beginners arent usually aggressive enough to treat these like large cuttings and lop off most of the tuber mass. If you do that you have a buttress a trunk and foliage. Still immature but it will have started the process of making the most of the material. We already know most people dont throw them away we might as well arm them with possibilities of what they can do with them. Grafting is like an essential bonsai skill. Im going to graft some shimpaku onto an old gold juniper next spring. Is that not bonsai? When a pine gets too leggy and isnt backbudding you have to graft foliage back further on the branches. Not bonsai? It goes from being a problem to an advanced technique with no clear path. We strive to make grafts invisible but it isnt always possible. Better to start off working on a shitty graft than doing it wrong yourself and thinking it looks good. This isnt really directed at you for the most part. It just kind of annoys me. ,Bonsai,cs2zxzh,11,t5_2qowd

Dont even think about pruning it any time soon.They do grow fairly slowly so it may be  years before its time to do anything styling wise. As long as youre patient you can eventually upgrade it from mallsai status.

Take a smaller Phillips head screwdriver and make a very small number of holes through the soil to increase drainage. Get a shower head wand. Get more trees to water each tree for a second or two and then do a second or third round so water wont run off. Souls runs off some of the time. Thats what it does. ,Bonsai,cslcbu1,2,t5_2qowd

4632817,0,t1_ctec1pf,Ive been posting here for a long time well over  years including my previous account  a lifetime in Internet time and I post pretty regularly. I contribute pics of my own projects with detailed walkthroughs of what I did and histories of the trees that I work on. I answer noob questions almost every single day and there are many days where I spend an awful lot of my time patrolling the beginners thread. If anybody has earned the right to say their peace on topics that impact the sub its me. I cant claim to have the experience level of the three folks you mentioned but I have been growing bonsai trees for over  years and I do enjoy sharing the things Ive learned so that others can learn and grow their skills faster than it took me. Thats why I come here. I do have other things I could be doing with my time.Theres also a reason why I titled my post Unsolicited advice and I was pretty clear in the post that people can do whatever they want. But I have as much right to post my opinion as other people have of ignoring it. If you dont want tone police you cant try and police my words either. By scolding me for my post youre essentially doing exactly what youre accusing me of doing. I actually agree with many of your points. Less bullshit more bonsai pretty much sums up my thoughts on this as well. The only difference is that I believe we could cut down on some of the particularly bad behavior and that it would positively contribute to the sub. gt The least valuable thing about this sub is the constant barrage of posts with questions that could be answered in the sidebar or with a google search or by reading a single book.On this point Im afraid we disagree. I remember back before we created the beginners thread and it was much much worse. Weve made a lot of improvements and huge strides in getting information to the new folks to cut down on the mainthread chatter compared to the early days. While I do agree that it would be nice if folks did their homework before posting there are certain realities of hosting a public forum on reddit. People sometimes dont know theres a sidebar and some people just post without thinking to read the rules. I cant fix that one very easily.But for me the least valuable thing BY FAR is coming in every day and seeing threads that have devolved into the equivalent of Oh yeah? Well fuck you asshole! Yeah well FUCK YOU too! What fuck me? Fuck yo momma! You can find examples of what Im talking about literally in this very thread. As a regular contributor of helpful content I think I have a right to voice my opinion when I see things that are broken. Frankly when people converse this way it represents a fundamental breakdown of communication. Im guessing most people wouldnt speak this way to people in real life so why do it here? Theres a huge difference between differences in tone and being a dick and I see a lot of people continually cross that line. I dont have any interest in being the tone police and if you think I do you entirely missed the point of my post. It honestly wouldnt bother me at all if it didnt cause so many problems here. But when people start being dicks especially the namecalling it has a lot of negative sideeffects Theyre not talking about bonsai nor contributing anything useful whatsoever to the conversation When brand new people join our sub and see this they think WTF??  It contributes to this idea that were a bunch of elitist douche bags who hate beginners. Even amongst the regulars who converse this way I dont think its true. But I see arguments to this effect probably weekly and a lot of energy is expended talking about it. Every thread that breaks down like this creates a new batch of disgruntled users who will complain in the future thus perpetuating the madness.And just for the record some of the experts you are talking about have told me why they dont post as much. Its not because they dont want people policing their words and tone its because every thread devolves into a childish fuck you contest. utreehause just mentioned the other day how when he posted about JPN a few years back he had people calling him asshole elitist etc.  That kind of behavior is extremely disrespectful and its really not OK. You want to keep the experts from posting? Calling them an asshole when they post a legitimate wellinformed opinion is a pretty good way to do that.If you go back and read some of my comment history youll see I go out of my way to be respectful of others. That doesnt mean walking on eggshells to ensure nobody is offended but it does mean not engaging in petty childish namecalling and arguing. I dont always agree with every point others make and Im quick to jump in and offer my two cents. But I somehow manage to do it without slinging schoolyard insults.gt Complimentsandwiches are a psychological manipulation technique. When people realize youre trying to manipulate them they are rightly offended.I can see why you might think this but this is not true at all. Providing feedback using this method forces the person giving the feedback to think a little more carefully about their words and how they might land. Its a basic communication technique and its used and taught all over the world.Being nicer doesnt mean we dont correct the beginners when they come in and redirect them to the sidebarwikietc. That obviously needs to happen. And when people post a tree they worked on asking for advice they should be told if theyve butchered it. Quite a few of our regular contributors showed up here in exactly this way and are now serious students as a result. Again Im not suggesting we should treat everyone with kid gloves and be afraid if theyre offended by any word we say. Im really just saying dont be a dick. Its the one primary rule I live my life by and its carried me pretty far. ,Bonsai,ctejawm,5,t5_2qowd
4653891,0,t1_ctgpetq,Think about it like this plants have been around way longer then people. In their natural environment they dont need our protection especially from the elements. The only thing you really have to worry about is them drying out which would not happen if they werent in such small pots. This is why rain wont hurt them. Keep in mid though this only applies to plant in their natural environment I.e. Things that grow naturally where you live.

I live quite close to probably the most highly respected bonsai nursery in Sydney so I also have a great resource there. Ficus are actually one species we have a reasonable choice of. The other typical species used for bonsai are limited to the basic types. We have no yamadori as natives are protected so you can get into trouble very easily with epa and other authorities. Furthermore natives dont take well to being collected our larger trees general have root systems that go directly down for like m depending on the size of the tree. In terms of propagation ficus that have become naturalised and our natives grow like the rockets. Were talking m of growth a year in the ground. Seeds almost become a viable method for natives in the temperate and costal regions. ,Bonsai,ctzuwm8,2,t5_2qowd

4914182,0,t3_3i7nlc,Thrust into the shallow end here. I think that I need to take some action but despite reading articles and doing research I really have no idea where to start or what many of the actions actually are.My wife gave me this bonsai tree a week ago for my birthday. Im OCD and do a lot of advanced aquarium stuff so naturally she thought Id be a fit for bonsai. I have really no information at all about what type of plant it is and no idea where to start. It looks like it needs a trimming and wiring but I dont think thats necessarily where I need to start. After one week it seems that critters have dug into it weeds started growing the moss looks dry or parts of it are missing and there are browning spots appearing on the plant itself.I live in Florida and my wife insisted that the plant remain outside i have cats. It got direct sunlight on the leaves but I tried to keep the base out of the sun so it didnt dry out. I watered with not more than  cup of water each day this may be an error. Under the pebbles feels moist not wet but I wouldnt call it dry. The moss however tells another story. So Im very interested in doing this right. I know that I need to go slow be patient consistent and caring. I just dont know where to start. I dont want to start trimming I dont want to over water etc. I appreciate any help. We get messages like this in rreeftank so I know how I could seem frustrating to you guys with experience. I endeavor to do well with this plant with your help I am sure I can succeed. It has been a scorching gt degF here every day the past week but has rained each afternoon.I dont know where to start.

5079502,0,t3_3kktyr,Your question is a bit vague and its always better to post pictures so you can get more specific advice. Olives are semitropical. They normally go through a light dormancy in winter. So leave it outside until cold temps start in the fall. Usually the cutoff is around F. Put it in a south facing window and let it get light. The reduced light and temperature difference should trigger the light rest period. It will probably put out a bit of new growth even during dormancy. When temps get warm again bring it back outside. This is the dance we do with tropicals in temperate zones. Repot in spring as it starts to show new growth. Summer repotting is acceptable but not as good. Water well when outside sparingly when inside. Fertilize well when outside. Pruning at any node produces two opposite shoots at the node making ramification on olives easier than almost any other species. In stages of refinement they can be higher maintenance. ,Bonsai,cuy9t56,5,t5_2qowd

Just to make sure were talking the same language  nursery material means a nice big plant. Like a ft tall holly with a nice thick trunk. Youre looking to get a thick trunk that you will cut down significantly in the spring. Read the wiki section on material selection.,Bonsai,cvxikwf,3,t5_2qowd

5485795,0,t3_3q76cd,The more experienced bonsai pros in this forum will try to tell you that schefflera umbrella plants are a poor choice for bonsai but thats an answer that comes with decades of baggage about what they feel constitutes real bonsai.But dont let that stop you. This is an incredibly hardy plant that can bounce back from a lot of neglect tolerates low light tolerates either overwatering or underwatering and can actually thrive indoors when you give it a lot of light water whenever the top of the soil gets dry and fertilize occasionally if its in a low nutrient soil.Plus if you can keep the humidity high greenhouse or covered in plastic for a minigreenhouse many will begin to sprout aerial roots for a banyan style look.I have two myself that are still very much in a prebonsai state and will remain this way until the spring.Heres some recommended reading Schefflera The Indestructable Bonsai By Jerry MeislikFuku Bonsai  Dwarf ScheffleraTROPICAL BONSAI SHAPING TECHNIQUESBy Jerry Meislik Montana and David Fukumoto HawaiiNow I just want to address a couple of things that make Schefflera bonsai a different class of bonsai. There are many things about traditional bonsai techniques and advice that are totally contrary to dealing with a schefflera.In traditional bonsai the trees are meant to be kept outdoors. They thrive outdoors in the summer you allow the trees to begin going dormant in the fall you protect them from the elements to a degree but you keep them outdoors in the snow in the winter. You only ever do much pruning and shaping in the spring and maybe through the summer. And its generally accepted that you should only attempt to grow trees that are appropriate for your climate.And with schefflera its true that the best ones will be the ones grown in Hawaii Thailand The Philippines etc. But many people keep them indoors ... even some that use them for bonsai including states as far north as Michigan and Montana. These plants do not have a winter dormancy. With the proper care theyll continue to grow throughout the year. You actually prune these asneeded. If some of the petioles begin to grow too long for your liking you snip them off. The petioles on your plant are way too long. They get long like that when the plant isnt getting enough light.  Now theres one thing with schefflera that you might actually want to leave until spring chopping. This plant doesnt like to sprout many branches on its own but aggressive chopping of the branches is supposed to yield more branches and give it more character. But chopping should not be attempted on a weak plant. Actually people who have many schefflera highly recommend chopping all of them in order to weed out the weak ones. But thats not you and me.Here are my two scheffleras They were one plant when I inherited it from my grandmother in June. The one on the left was one really long skinny branch growing out of the main plant. I cut it off and repotted it and Im mostly leaving it be while it establishes its roots. The reason some of the leaves are cut in half is because when I took the cutting I cut all of the leaves in half because I read somewhere that it would help the plant require less energy while growing new roots. But in the last couple of months its grown a lot of new leaves too. Those are the ones that are not cut in half.The one on the right is the main plant. I fully defoliated it in June it all grew back with a vengeance and Ive heavily pruned it continuously since then. The cone of peat around the trunk is there to help it put out aerial roots from the trunk for later styling.Eventually Ill get to dig it up and expose the roots when it gets repotted again.,Bonsai,cwcv0g8,14,t5_2qowd

Youd need a very large trunk to get the branches to look right at scale which is likely to take forever indoors.As for pruning anything Im not familiar with this species so youll probably need to experiment. Since you have five of these you can experiment with  or  and leave the rest alone. Keep in mind that those compound leaves are probably each a long selfcontained leaf probably not a branch with lots of small leaves.,Bonsai,cwstbhf,1,t5_2qowd

5943066,0,t1_cxxssq2,Appreciate the input.  . Suspected the same.  Maybe Im just stuck on a favorite species but Im thinking I might collect this anyway and use it in a shade garden.  Itll be fun...er maybe just frustrating well see.. Makes sense.  Would it be conceivable to cut high and experiment with the resulting deadwood or is it just too straight to get a believable taper out of it.  Again maybe this will be another failed future experiment.So this group of options represents my second attempt at finding suitable material.  The first round I was looking at trees with a focus on low branches but ruled out what I found in the end because they were all too small.  This time I was more focused on size and a pleasing trunk and roots but still havent really been able envision the taper or more aptly what can be made into a believable taper.  Should I be further refining my search by requiring developed low branches?  Also some of the trees that were deemed too small are now growing on the edge of my yardwhat are your thoughts on spacing for field grown trees?Ill leave some questions for the next thread...I think I owe you a beer already.

All is not lost however it does look like a recently discovered species  years ago from Vietnam called Xanthocyparis vietnamensis the foliage shape and color are right. If it is than it is a very rare tree. As far as I can figure there is literally no other conifer with scalelike foliage that could survive in the lowlands of Malaysia so if it is not a Vietnamese Golden Cypress then I would think that it is doomed.

I have one Im working on where I did exactly that.But at some point it needs to go back in the ground. Oaks take forever to grow out even in the ground. Growing an oak trunk in a pot will be way too slow. Now if you collect one that already has a trunk you like thats a different story. Id still grow it in the pot but Id probably use a nursery pot for a good long while before ever thinking about a bonsai pot.Whether you try this or not consider getting something that grows faster like elm or maple.

6675012,0,t1_d09a7kg,Our winters arent particularly dry... really we only have one dry season which is Summer.  A lot of trees do go dormant during this period but Id avoid collecting then if possible.  Its not the same kind of dormancy as winter dormancy and they dont get the benefit of spring directly after our autumn is like a lesser spring.  Collecting during Winter isnt just about dormancy as much as its about the growth spurt that happens after.  Chopping up a tree right before a rough season isnt good for the tree and our autumn can be hit or miss,Bonsai,d09r5q4,4,t5_2qowd

6717666,0,t3_47mpmk,This is a really nice tree  probably one of the nicest beginner trees Ive seen here actually. Dont rush it by trying to get it into a bonsai pot too soon. It would be a shame to kill or damage it by doing too much work on it too soon.Id focus on getting the roots all set up first and then gradually work it back down to a proper bonsai pot. Are things waking up in Vancouver yet? Im guessing it will still be OK to at least do a gentle repot Id probably go wider and somewhat shallower on the pot if it didnt require hacking at the roots and get rid of some of that organic soil in the process. If in doubt just keep it as is until next spring  it will probably be fine.Take your time  find the right pot wait for the right moment. I could easily imagine spending  seasons prepping this one for a bonsai pot depending on where the root system is currently at. As for foliage just let it grow for now. Post more pics as you make progress with it. Looking forward to seeing more of this one.,Bonsai,d0e5xyx,4,t5_2qowd
6722106,0,t1_d0eej9q,There are two main issues I see here  one is that the pots too small and the other is that youve been growing it indoors. This is one of those trees that was arguably put in a bonsai pot prematurely. I wouldnt worry about pruning anything until it is very full amp bushy. To achieve that Id pot it up into a larger pot and put it outside for the entire growing season.The reason its confusing as to what to prune is because there isnt enough growth to make it obvious and therefore nothing to prune!. When trees grow properly its starts to become very obvious when and what should be pruned.Podocarpus is a coldhardy plant so it probably requires dormancy. Im not  on this since I dont have one and theyre rated from zones . They might be like chinese elms in regards to dormancy but I dont know.But no matter what it should not be sitting under a grow light in July  if it cant grow and fill in it will eventually decline and die.,Bonsai,d0emgrp,3,t5_2qowd

6967068,0,t1_d161hf7,I faced this early on as well. Here are two tricks I used they may be very impracticable for you for reasons that will become obvious.     First I always knocked on a door with one of my daughters in my arms. There is nothing less threatening than a grown man carrying a small child. It worked for me at least  of the time.  This is the one that may be impracticable   Second when talking about money have the money in your hand. My younger brother  a criminal psychologist and stock broker !!!? taught me an awesome trick.  If you are offering the person  dollars have the money in   bills folded in half. Turns out when money is involved physical size matters go figure I did this every time and cant really say if it helped or hurt.   Next be truthful. If the tree is valuable say its valuable. It all depend on what people perceive as valuable right? You start by saying I like to work with bonsai trees just like in the movie The karate Kid. You have a very valuable tree in your yard. I thinks its worth at least . Would you consider selling it to me. At the first skeptical look offer to replace the tree with a similar nursery plant  if you sell it to me for . This works way more often than youd think.     Hanging out with Dan Robinson for  years has basically thought me every negotiation trick in the book. There are entire vistas of tactics for national Forest Ranger Districts and for Ranchers but that wont be all that useful in New England.,Bonsai,d161x44,3,t5_2qowd

7137768,0,t3_4dbngj,Cuttings are definitely more of a horticultural endeavor than a bonsai one but there are some cool things you can do with them that arent attainable any other way. You can wire small cuttings before during or after you root them to introduce tight bends low on the trunk. Sliding a cd over the tree threading the single stem through the center and then growing it out a few years can eventually develop a super flat root system with an extremely tapered bole  if allowed to grow out wild.You could easily do this in  gallon containers.Forest plantings are also often done with cuttings.Like I said though it is really more of a horticultural challenge. Study up about local species and find out which season is best for taking each.  Some trees only root with greenwood cuttings while others can root off older wood. Humidity is key. Youre gonna need a mini greenhouse or propagation tent to stay warm and wet and maybe even a warming mat.Collecting is also a prime way to acquire plants on the cheap. The only real investments are tools soil potsand time.,Bonsai,d1phizp,1,t5_2qowd

Also do you have many inverse taper problems when branches throw out roots? How do you overcome this?

The smaller of the twin trunks has good low branching and youd gain great taper without the need to start from nothing after a chop.  Id suggest you not keep it the way it is the trunks are too crowded because they are growing in a similar direction.  Id avoid trying to wedge them apart you can split the crotch down the middle and ruin your tree with an acute crotch angle like that it wont take much tensile stress to literally rip the tree in half.  ,Bonsai,d2k4ob2,1,t5_2qowd

Will repot into something much smaller in future years.So you think it will survive? What do you think of the branch structure? Feedback is appreciated.,Bonsai,d36f5ly,2,t5_2qowd

7656754,0,t3_4jhvnq,I own  acres approx. . wooded bordering the Hoosier National Forest in southern Indiana. Id really like to start getting into bonsai but my finances are tight right now so Id like to spend as little as possible on materials. There are a lot of wild trees around here to pick from but I just dont know what types of trees have the best potential. We have white and black oaks cherry poplar sycamore and many others. Im not that great at identifying trees either. I guess my main questions would beWhat diameter tree trunks should I be looking for? Should I for example cut the length off a tree or two and leave them planted in the woods for a couple years?Can I use natural soil andor natural rocksgravel from the creek on my property?,Bonsai,d3cj3mp,3,t5_2qowd

When I got it it had just been moved from a  gallon bucket to a  gallon bucket.  The trunk is about half inch thick.  I want to trunk chop it so its shorter.  I want the trunk to thicken up as well.  Its curently about  feet tall and in potting soil from the nursery where I purchased it from.  Any help is welcomed and thank you in advance.EDIT Having some major app issues right now.

7984449,0,t1_d4d0hz9,Trees have to be secured to their pots because in bonsaiing a plant generally you want to chop the long structural roots that would provide stability to the tree and encourage the small feeder roots that nourish the tree. Without wiring them in the fragile growing tips of bonsai roots can easily break when the tree is jostled from wind wild animals heavy rain or clumsy bonsai owners. Its even more imperative to wire a bonsai tightly when you are thinking about moving a tree wiring its branches or carving it. There are many ways to secure a tree into a pot but I use Boons method simply because its easy and very very secure. ,Bonsai,d4dj03n,1,t5_2qowd

8102020,0,t1_d4pz80v,Regarding question . And again Im talking more generically to learn technique then any tree in particular.zoomed in detail of previous photo   Here you can see the red arrow points to a branch that I outlined in light blue. The photo is basically shot straight from the side so the branch is moving significantly upward from the main branch it grew from. So I was trying to ask if the foliage pad development would benefit from wiring these upward branches flatter and all in a plane as in these photos from the articles above I just wasnt sure if JPN immature foliage should be styled similar to that. And  or if there is a different way of styling JPNs spiky disposition. Given how much the needles shoot upward at the end of branches I thought perhaps there might be a different technique used. Perhaps it varies on tree size? A small tree needs more cloudybushy foliage pads where a largeolder tree that has much more ramification can have foliage pads like the bonsaime photos above?Thanks for any thoughts anyone. I truly appreciate it.,Bonsai,d4qqnkl,1,t5_2qowd
8102270,0,t1_d4qra2c,Got ya maybe Ill get a more design concept based question and ask questions to learn off of that as an example.

8736969,0,t3_4zoxe4,To be honest I dont think those seeds will ever germinate.  I have more experience with Sugar Maple but when they go from light brown to black theyve been killed by mold or bugs.  Sometimes one rainfall will kill anything that doesnt take root.  Its best to collect on a dry day when they are falling off on their own in large amounts.  If you split one open to test it should have a slight green to the seed part and the rest should be light brown more like this picture.    Or even like this picture the seeds arent quite as black as what you have.  Similarly anything that still has color to the fan part of the seed fell off too early.  ,Bonsai,d6xrpwt,10,t5_2qowd

8766319,0,t1_d71fh0p,gt Yeah to me this is how to grow a trunk wile growing the branches as well. Youre right thats exactly what Im showing. The key to what makes it work is letting them get very shaggy in between major prunings. I tend to hedge prune then let them fill in then scale them up then hedge prune again then scale them up etc. Ill often scale something up for  years before scaling it back down again. Thats one of the things I was trying to show here.Ive seen some people try to do this method by hardpruning everything back to the trunk line every season. That way really doesnt work very well. The tree is in a constant state of stress and you miss out on some really beautiful branches that might have needed a few years to develop into something nice.For certain not everything will work as Ive drawn it here. For some things you really need to grow the trunk line first and then develop branches from there.  Korean hornbeam is a good example at least for the initial trunk line. It would take forever to build a trunk the way Ive shown here on a hornbeam.  Larger elm species as well seem to require height in order to get an reasonable amount of trunk width.  Standard acer palmatum is somewhere in between. Doesnt need to get  feet tall but it does need to be allowed to run for a while to thicken substantially in a reasonable time frame. But once you get a basic frame in place you can use shorter sacrifice branches till the cows come how to strategically thicken certain parts of the trunk.,Bonsai,d71gayz,1,t5_2qowd

8997729,0,t1_d7tc6vb,gt Luckily I just found out there is a large landscape supply store with anything I could think of for soil amendments close enough to me that I shouldnt have that issue anymore. Pretty stoked.Wow thats great. Im able to get bulk quantities of turface metromix and grit fairly easily but I dont have the onestopshop for all the rest. I think turface is a fantastic ingredient. Lots of people seem to prefer akadama but Im pretty happy with the results I get. I tried the clay absorbent stuff for a season with a few trees and quickly decided I didnt like it. The DE absorbent would almost certainly be much better but theres nowhere around me that sells that kind and I see no point in paying for shipping when I can get bulk turface locally.Id love a place where I can get cheap bulk pumice or lava but havent found that yet.fwiw if you are going to use organics I really like the MetroMix . Its worth trying if you have access to a bag of it. Its basically fancy potting soil but it blends in nicely with the inorganic components. The mix I described is pretty much identical to what the local bonsai shop uses for thousands of trees so its known good. There are certainly amendments one could make with other ingredients but its a pretty good baseline soil.,Bonsai,d7tdyp6,1,t5_2qowd

9667277,0,t1_da4ibk2,Early spring is the best time to do rootwork. You want the tree to recover and start to end new roots before you dig it up I assume? New root growth pretty much only happens above F and the ground is well insulated from frosts unlike our pots! I am not sure whay collection timeframe you had in mind but Id definitely recommend chopping those thick roots in spring and then digging into bit wider than your chops sometime later when you actually collect perhaps the following spring?.,Bonsai,da4p0at,1,t5_2qowd
9704785,0,t3_5e0o9q,Its not entirely clear to me what you were trying to achieve with this chop.  Either you are growing it out to grow the lower trunk in which case it didnt need chopping at all or youve finished growing and youre developing branches  in which case why is it chopped so high?,Bonsai,da9bmwa,3,t5_2qowd
9807536,0,t1_dalj6w9,Listen dude you gave the wrong advice out of lack of experience. The reason the books say to collect in fall or spring is because the tree is dormant but the ground isnt frozen which is still the case. The point is that you need to collect when its dormant not that it has to be spring or fall which can be misunderstood if you havent collected many trees. The reason I said what I said is because you were not saying from what I understand... you said First really bad time to collect and to do trunk chops. This is absolutely untrue and actually bad advice. I agree what I said could have been worded different but I think your post could have been worded differently as well.,Bonsai,dalzm73,1,t5_2qowd

9914697,0,t1_dazt2zr,Root development notice the outer pot is like a sieve... the inner pot will be the same making it easy to pull the tree up and trim the roots to promote a tighter root ball trimming the roots will prompt the tree to grow finer roots closer to the base ensuring your tree can surviv e in a smaller bonsai pot.

9984466,0,t3_5il09c,A couple of problems here. Its a Juniper so it needs to be outside. It will die if you keep it indoors for long.. Those weeds are going to draw nutrients from the soil and eventually theyll fill up the whole pot. They need to go.,Bonsai,db905n1,11,t5_2qowd
10000633,0,t1_dbahib0,I dont think the reverse taper is that big a deal at all. Ive seen fullsize trees with more reverse taper than that. And the roots dont look too bad to me either. It probably needs about five years of growth and ramification and wiring along the way to scale it up a bit create welldefined branches and blend the bottom of the trunk in with the branches.

10099245,0,t1_dbnxljm,Thats good to know but I get pretty annoyed with anybody that perpetuates the myth that junipers are indoor trees. Theyre not and they always die eventually. For that reason I could never recommend a book on indoor growing with a temperate tree on the cover regardless of the content. I had a similar issue with those floating bonsai. I found it a bit silly to begin with but I dont believe its even remotely practical to keep some of the trees happy that they showed in their marketing videos. Always wakes it feel borderline scammy when people who should probably know better promote incorrect technique to push product.,Bonsai,dbny1vl,3,t5_2qowd
10127376,0,t1_dbrlfsv,Ah. I assumed warnings like that about failing indoors were at trying to grow them just using natural light in windows not using full solar spectrum grow lights and proper light timing for the type of tree full sun partial sun etc. ,Bonsai,dbrlpyy,2,t5_2qowd

10193847,0,t3_5lz1hj,So this is the theory. Then comes all practical issues. Since every plant is different you got nearly infinite combination of plant vase stand accent and maybe scroll to put on display. So just for exercise is useful to try to display plants and listen to your local community opinions trying different setup to see what could be the best visual composition. Just moving the plant few centimeters or changing light conditions can give a different feel of your display. ,Bonsai,dbzj1ef,1,t5_2qowd

10304619,0,t1_dc9bnep,This is definitely a good start. I like that you shortened the branches and wired motion into what was left. I would give this a couple seasons to recover and grow before doing anything else. Slow and steady with junipers generally yields better trees.Keep acquiring new material whenever you can. Every season get at least one new tree that is as good or better than anything you currently own. That way youre gradually adding better material to your collection that requires more skill to develop. When I get new stuff particularly species I havent worked on before I usually do very little to it the first season other than light experimental pruning and observing how it grows. The tree will teach you how to work on it if you pay attention.,Bonsai,dcc313e,1,t5_2qowd

My only issue with them is trying to figure out to finish them in a way that works well and more importantly doesnt hurt the health of my trees.

10911873,0,t1_de4q6cp,Junipers take a long time to look dead so they could be dead or dying for months without changing colour. Also its never a good idea to fertilize a plant that isnt healthy because itll stress it out even more. Get another tree and try again maybe something more forgiving than a juniper.And trees belong outside,Bonsai,de5hdfc,1,t5_2qowd
10925897,0,t1_de6ddmq,Of course we need to be conscientious when collecting material. Part of that is weighing our different options depending on the broader impact of our actions. In the case of collecting from the wild a typical outing might consist of a few people heading out in a couple cars tromping around some scrubby woods on the edges of a farm and digging up a dozen or two little trees. If its the sort of wooded land that the owner clears brush out of every few years to reduce fire hazards those trees probably wouldntve grown up anyway. YMMV on the type of woodland but ultimately there are a lot more young seedlings in any forest than will ever grow up to be a big tall tree.Or you could buy a premade bonsa or prebonsai. Its most likely to have been imported from a farm generally in China where they grow thousands of nearlyidentical trees to ship out. The land it was grown on would have had to have been cleared of any forest that might have been on it and theyre going to need to regularly bring in topsoil fertilizer and water for irrigation. After growing for  years itll be dug up and potted. Then itll be boxed into a climatecontrolled shipping container and put on a container ship where itll make its way to a wholesale distributor like Lodder Bonsai who will resell it to smaller distributors like malls or neighborhood garden centers.When looking at it like this collecting from the wild seems to be a much less resourceintensive option. Seems much less wasteful overall. Much smaller carbon footprint.,Bonsai,de6xhk1,5,t5_2qowd

But most ficus are cold hardy to about C so depending on the variety of the ficus or wind chill it may have gotten colder than what the plant could handle and damaged the leaves.  .  Soil is a really tricky one.  Youll get  different answers if you ask  different bonsai enthusiasts.  The thing everyone will agree on is granular fast draining soil no dirt or garden soil.  bonsaime has a section on bonsai soil as well as this article by colin lewis  Most of us dont buy a brand of bonsai soil theyre usually poor quality and have way too much organic components to them.  I like Als Gritty Mix which is a formula of equal parts Turface pine bark and granit grit which I buy sift and mix myself.  The easiest thing for you to do would be to contact a local bonsai club and ask them if you can buy a small bag of bonsai soil for a tropical.

Ive seen just using plastic wrap to cover the moss allowing light in. Ive seen people use foil one guy in particular on YouTube uses foilcant remember his name Id be worried that would cook in the sun. Ive also seen people use plastic planters. Is there any benefit to one method over another? Do different species respond to certain methods more?,Bonsai,deo6h7k,2,t5_2qowd

11137178,0,t1_deub03r,Im not very familiar with this particular species and I dont know what your desired end product but if you want a thicker trunk the fastest way is to put it in the ground if you have some available. Oftentimes growers will let something grow in the ground unconstrained for a few years to build the trunk. Sacrifice branches will be allowed to grow tall and provide lots if thickness to the trunk below while lower branches are trained and will remain when the sacrifice is removed. Some species can be developed in pots but larger pots will allow for faster development as well. For both large pots or the ground the trees are eventually reduced in size to transplant in a bonsai pot near the end of their training. Heavy fertilizing also helps.Growing bonsai from seed takes a bit of knowhow from the get go so I definitely encourage you to read a lot now if this is your desired path. A seedling that spends its whole life in a bonsai pot can take a decade to build a pencil size trunk and something in trained in the ground can build a pepsican thick trunk in half the time.Most people do not start their bonsai pursuit with seeds but I wish you all the luck with it!  It would probably be good to get multiple going so youre less attached if one dies.

11608508,0,t3_62zgcq,noob here is it possible for two bonsais in the same pot to be intertwined or will they just compete for resources?,Bonsai,dgbu1su,1,t5_2qowd
11622210,0,t1_dgc5vh4,Slip potting or planting them in the ground is a good idea especially since these have been neglected for so long. Id cut off the deadwood on the maple. You wouldnt be using anything that high up anyway. Watch out for a reverse taper happening with the bulge on picture . No styling decisions until you get these growing really strong under your care.  ,Bonsai,dgddzvx,2,t5_2qowd

11643505,0,t1_dgfqouc,Its pretty necessary. Ibiza and Troms are both in the EU but have nothing in common as far as climate and local plant pathogens go,Bonsai,dgfszl0,3,t5_2qowd

11645783,0,t1_dgfas5y,If you are not looking to join a club yet a beginners bonsai book might be your best weapon. I bought Harry Harringtons Foundations of Bonsai and found it wellwritten and clear. Re. your bush I think Lilacs grow readily when chopped hard but do make sure they are Lilacs before you do that. Other common garden plants that react well to severe chopping include Privets Ligustrum Chinese privet Waxleaf privet Glossy Privet Trident Maple Amur Maple and Chinese Elm Ulmus parvifolia.,Bonsai,dgg2afh,1,t5_2qowd
11653562,0,t1_dggnp8e,Your teeth might not like that feta very much. Its perlite a volcanic rock. Thats what was recommended to me to start it in.,Bonsai,dggy21m,4,t5_2qowd
11658288,0,t1_dge6za8,Just curious how important is it that you have only one type of soil? Ive potted one of my trees and combed out a lot of roots but didnt want to stress it too much so I didnt remove all of the nursery soil is this okay? It also looks sick,Bonsai,dghhcgc,1,t5_2qowd

11691155,0,t1_dgl7jqd,They certainly make it easier than trying to overwinter trees that are too warm for your zone,Bonsai,dgl7l6u,6,t5_2qowd
11703861,0,t1_dgml0in,Oh my mistake.  When you said literati I was thinking of tanuki aka pheonix graft.  I had my terms confused.  ,Bonsai,dgmngua,1,t5_2qowd
11724809,0,t3_67atrk,Wait. You can literally dig them up whenever as long as they are healthy. Unless it was recently a huge bushy plant like less than a week or two ago I would give it a few more months go recover some foliage. ,Bonsai,dgp1czq,3,t5_2qowd
11728417,0,t1_dgpb39j,If you could fill out your flair or at least tell us where you live that would help us tell you what can work in your area,Bonsai,dgpg38g,1,t5_2qowd
11771681,0,t1_dgtvj75,It has to be outside all the time never indoors ever during all four seasons. Dont let anyone tell you otherwise because they simply will not survive inside a house. You do want some sort of a winter protection especially from the wind. ,Bonsai,dguco6k,2,t5_2qowd
