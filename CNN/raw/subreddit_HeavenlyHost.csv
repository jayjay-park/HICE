1454587,0,t3_2at90c,I would really love to get an early look at Blood Drive but I do watch the anime man and see all the work he puts into these videos. I really want to see him finish Hysteric Birthday first since these videos take so long and we also know that they will not be localizing U while there will most likely be a localization of Blood Drive which makes me want him to focus on U instead. It took  episodes to finish chapter . There are  chapters so   episodes. The length between episodes varies but if he releases one video a week and we take out the  already out then we still have  months until Hysteric Birthday is finished. Since it is going to be that long approximately I would rather wait until U is finished than see a Blood Drive playthrough started. For me right now U is helping me pass the time until Blood Drive is translated and if we wait that long we will probably have a better idea of when we will see an english Blood Drive so we can play it for ourselves which I most of the time would rather do.TLDR Would rather have as much effort as possible put into finishing U than see him start Blood Drive when it comes out. ,HeavenlyHost,ciylw0z,1,t5_2zuc4

6966153,0,t3_4b1bim,This game had so many issues with it that Im actually annoyed I spent full value on it when the game was released.Personally had the game crash  times luckily I had never lost huge amounts of time as I had saved  mins to an hour before each occurrence. The game had the most complex but weakest story out of the series. Frame rate was almost non existent. And the mechanics with the ghouls was godawful.Id wait till the game drops in price or pick it up used. Just be thankful that you didnt drop  on the European Special Edition like myself.If you already picked it up my word of advice is save often and try to avoid going into your menu as much as possible.,HeavenlyHost,d15y6hz,3,t5_2zuc4
7011755,0,t1_d1b0y0s,No nothing like that. Just make sure to make multiple saves so its easier for you to track all the wrong ends.,HeavenlyHost,d1b4o6u,2,t5_2zuc4

8771082,0,t3_501hf6,I dont have the original on my PSTV but I do have Book of Shadows on my PSTV and it works fine. Im just guessing but Im pretty sure that Blood Covered Repeated Fear will work on a PSTV.,HeavenlyHost,d721u08,2,t5_2zuc4

10091028,0,t3_5kae9x,According to quick research the cgs arent changed. The censorship is that instead of showing you a cg it blacks out. Not sure if this is true though I only google for a minute or two.,HeavenlyHost,dbmvlig,2,t5_2zuc4
10522575,0,t3_5qojdt,The order  CORPSEPARTY or Corpse Party Rebuilt. This is the original Corpse Party made with RPG maker before it got remade with added characters and more complex plot. If youre curious about the original Corpse Party you may want to check this out. Corpse Party PCPSPiOSDS and its adaptation  Corpse Party BloodCovered manga Tortured Souls OVA Missing Footage OVA live action movie etc Corpse Party Book of Shadows also has manga adaptation and liveaction movie Corpse Party U only available in Japanese there should be translated playthrough on Youtube if you dont know Japanese. Also have manga adaptation though its much shorter Corpse Party Blood Drive Corpse Party  Dead Patient still unfinished for nowSpinoffs can be seen in any order Corpseparty Musume manga combination of elements from the old CORPSEPARTY and the remake with lots of ecchi stuff Corpse Party Another Child manga Corpse Party CEMETERY mangaThere are also light novels and drama CDs but they dont get translated I translated some bits of the novels but I just dont have lots of free time these days. In general Corpse Party adaptations will have differences from the original games so it would be both familiar and new at the same time.,HeavenlyHost,dd0uirw,1,t5_2zuc4
10892568,0,t3_5qa1yh,A little late but I feel like the franchise is in a flux right now. On one hand were probably gonna get Dead Patient as a full game eventually but the new live action movies really arent helping. Not to mention Blood Drive basically ruined the series for long time fans like myself. After revisiting the game Ive come to like it though it has its charm. I want Corpse Party to keep going but at the same time it might be for the best to stop any further damage to its reputation.,HeavenlyHost,de3how5,1,t5_2zuc4
