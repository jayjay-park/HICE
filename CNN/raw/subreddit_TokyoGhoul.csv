I think V is a orginazation that prevents the ghouls from over feeding and keeping humanity as the dominant species.

4044100,0,t3_36ugkc,I always thought there was always a certain immature quality to Kanekis thinking and how he went about to attain his goals in TG postAogiri until the Kanou lab raid where after he pulled himself back to reaccess himself and his situation. During that time he was awkward and shallow and instead of really getting into his character and being affected by his predicament I found myself lacking in empathy for him. Its the reason why Im more sympathetic to and like him a lot more as Haise. Though it isnt shown exactly how he got to where he is now in the two years since becoming Haise I feel like he grew up a lot under very uncertain circumstances and is still trying very earnestly to make the best of whats thrown at him.,TokyoGhoul,crh9ax5,4,t5_315h3
4045315,0,t3_36vgld,There are a couple of options open right now. One is that Takizawa doesnt care about Hinami protecting Kaneki he wants to kill Haise and will fight Hinami because of it. This might cause Kaneki to come back. I do not think this one is very likely due to Seidou being probably somewhat fond of Hinami the lt in the text panel.The second one is that Hinami takes Haise with her either to Aogiri or another safe location such as re to help him regain his memories. I also dont think Aogiri is very likely as Haise would probably still not be safe there but re is somewhat likely.The third one is that Akira shows up and chaos ensues.

4060784,0,t1_crj4hn2,But Takizawa said himself pain is no longer a factor to consider for him. He was really about to start ripping apart and eating Haise for being an utter disappointment to him. Takizawa likely knows about Haise because hes been told that he is meant to be a replacement for Kaneki a Kaneki . if you recall that Eto and Kanou wanted to create. He laughed at the idea that he was even being compared with Kaneki. His orders were simply to fight Haise probably to test the success of the new Owls if he wins he can do whatever as Aogiri has no use for something weaker than the new Owls. If he loses well he dies I guess or returns to Aogiri to go through a hell worse than hes experienced. Im starting to think when Kanou experimented on him they placed a safety feature in him like to break downexplodewhatever if he acted out.

4760747,0,t1_ctumi2j,The game does at least loosely follow certain events from the manga such as Kaneki forming a group with Tsukiyama Banjou and the others and partly takes place during the six month timeskip after the Aogiri arc.Some screenshots indicate it will cover the Anteiku Raid so it is possible it will deviate from the manga. However apparently the JAIL incident in the game is what resulted in Kijimas scarred appearance not  sure if this is true just saw this one the wiki. Will try to confirm so I wouldnt dismiss the idea of at least part of the games story being adapted into the mangas continuity in a flashback or being mentioned in dialogue.Even if it covers the Anteiku Raid it doesnt really mean it isnt canon to the manga. It could show us what happened to Rio during that time Kijima wasnt present during the raid in the manga so maybe well see where he was as well. So rather than being another continuity it could just be events that happened offpanel.This is just based on what Ive seen related to the game though I could be entirely wrong.,TokyoGhoul,ctumxo0,4,t5_315h3

4818386,0,t3_3gsnbl,The reason this fan art bothers me is because Tooru identifies as male and can be considered a trans character. Trans people have difficulty gaining recognition and are often portrayed as deviant by our media. Drawing both Tooru and Saiko in feminine clothes implies Tooru is a woman instead of swapping both genders. We live in a society that is guilty of whitewashing people to fit our views. Take a look at the Stonewall Riots movie which replaces the instigators who were trans people of color with white cis men as a recent example.Why is this an issue when we live in a world with genderbending? For one genderbending tends to swap everyones gender. But more importantly cis people are the dominant group. Trans people have a history of being excluded even from the LGBT movement. Drawing a cis person as trans is different from drawing a trans person as cis because we live in a society that gives privilege to one group and marginalizes the other. If you need an example to relate to poor people can make fun of rich people but when rich people make fun of poor people people view it negatively e.g. Mitt Romney . Because a rich person has a lot of privileges like being rich and the dominant class making fun of the nondominant group shows them as insensitive to the advantages they have.In the end artists are allowed to make any artwork they desire. But we as the audience are also allowed to criticize the art. ,TokyoGhoul,cu1wazl,7,t5_315h3

5060169,0,t3_3k51rd,Ive never watch a Chibi video before but that segment made me so uncomfortable just watching him as a person. From a biological standpoint hes quite offbase. Or at least there are so many aspects hes missing. Hes trying to say that if the ROS formed in the back suddenly a human has a kagune? No. Its an organ its much more complex than that. What about the Kakuhou? What about the fact that there are four distinct places where a kakuhou can be? Genetically the likelihood of the mutation of ROS in those four exact spots is such a small statistic it cant even be considered. Theres no coincidence in the kakuhou formation. There had to have been many more layers to this sort of evolution it couldnt possibly happen in one generation like he suggests. It requires a long line of chance mutations and adaptations. If Im being realistic I know that Ishida probably didnt excessively study human genetics while writing this piece but if Chibis gonna apply biology to the argument then so will I. Theres just... so much he doesnt consider and so much he overlooks. I could point out so many issues but this is already a wall of text. While I do agree with the basic thought that ROS bridges some form of gap between humans and ghouls I think hes supporting this opinion poorly.Now his second argument about Kanous research that I can jump on board with. Very interesting. Some stuff he assumes doesnt quite add up but he brings up a lot of good things to consider.,TokyoGhoul,cuvxwnn,1,t5_315h3

5224044,0,t1_cvfoeje,The CCG always came across as black. The whole purpose of the CCG is killing ghouls to protect the humans. Its an organization that runs on genocide. Even from the beginning of the series there were agents like Mado who had that one singular ghoul kill as many ghouls as possible. He gets axed and we got Juuzo and eventually there were others like Hachikawa who didnt even care about civilians just wanted to kill ghouls granted he was fighting Kaya and she was responsible for his scarring but still pretty damn murderous and didnt care about bystanders. Now the story focus is on the CCG and were seeing even more of the psychos pop up. So yeah CCG is kinda fucked up.

When I think of how this line applies in re and Tsukiyama and Horis relationship I kind of worry that Hori might be revealed in the near future to have backstabbed Tsukiyama.

If you want to follow the main story which is much better than the animes version youll need to read the manga from chapter  since the anime omitted some important scenes throughout. Its worth it even if you dont normally read manga since its far better than the anime version.Its also a bit unlikely that the anime will get a third season continuing from Root A due to content being changed and omitted. Even if it does Id say its still better to read the manga given that the animes story has been very mediocre in comparison. You can either read the manga now and watch the rest of the anime later or just read it after watching. Ideally its better to read the manga first since a lot of season  doesnt make much sense otherwise since its missing a major portion of the story.I provided the reading order and links to the manga and its sequel and spinoffs in the link above.

5727350,0,t1_cx6x6na,gt Well since you are suggesting there is something else to deduce from all that Id like to know in case Im not seeing something I should here.That still doesnt answer my question.

I jestingly say that we should have seen this coming but I didnt actually mean it. I havent been implying theres something else to deduce from this and I dont know what you mean.gt Im sure its not just what I think. The reasoning behind sexual reassignment surgery is to make the body match the gender identity that a person identifies with its not a beauty aesthetic like body modification is you need clearance from the appropriate medical professionals in order to do it. I would say a transitioned person would be offended to have their surgery referred to as body modification it trivializes the idea behind the reassignment surgery. Like Ive said I have never heard of sexual reassignment surgery being referred to as body modification or vice versa.Okay but Im offended isnt an argument against the literal definition of words. It is still modifying the body. There are no negative insinuations from those words unless youre projecting your own. Besides most trans people dont modify their body at least not in any sense like Big Madam. They tend to go on hormones and some of them will get sex reassignment surgery but only some.

Okay he doesnt need to live to the end of the series but ishida pls. Give him a happier death. He couldnt even see Sassan.And I want to see Sassan too. Akaneki is badass yeah thats a stablished fact already but he seems waaay  edgy for me to like him much. Besides he doesnt seem like hes gonna do much other than just wreck shit up chaotically.

5906436,0,t3_3w6k6f,Im curious why you think Furuta would try to do this. Hes suspected to be Souta and so aligned with the Clowns but we really dont know what his motive for being at CCG is whether its just being a mole for the sake of intelligence gathering or for convenience of having a Clown in CCG. We dont even know why he bothered to kill everyone at the scene of the battle. Furuta entered CCG normally he would have had to be there for at least two years which means the Clowns should have known about HaiseKaneki for a while already so why would they all of a sudden make such a deliberate move now to push him to the brink? Especially since Kaneki seems to have gotten there with Etos help already. I think the Clowns would rather sit back to enjoy the show. Its more fun for them to be able to watch while doing as little as possible to affect the outcome. Hinami is already destined for execution and Kaneki has remembered already so its not like they need to give that extra push.,TokyoGhoul,cxtv80r,5,t5_315h3

Im not mad at Ishida for this but if Mutsuki is just hiding from something as you say then I am pretty disappointed and I can image anyone who emphasized with him for being trans might feel a little betrayed if they got so attached to a character that was only pretending. Yeah there will be a lot of butthurt sjws but can you blame them really when Mutsuki has been straight up trans to this point if it turns out in the end that she was just a straight female the whole time that would completely ruin their most relatable character for them.,TokyoGhoul,cy05g99,-1,t5_315h3

Nothing really besides shelter and body supplies.He only agreed to go with them because his status in the human world is basically gone. Aogiri were searching for Kanou so that they can ask or by Force make him join them.Clearly he agreed to work for them. But what stops them from killing him off once they are done? Nothing. So this means he has to have another partner a partner he had a long time.Aka the clowns.Aogiri were looking for Kanou during the Aogiri raid. Who was there? Nico. Who is Nico working for? The Clowns.We seen two confirmations of Nicos trait. High recovery and extremely good hearing.Why wouldnt you send the guy who has amazing hearing into the enemies base?Now you can say Nico was only there for Yamori blah blah blah.They met at a club people. You really think Nico didnt have this all planned? We seen Nico BestGirlRoma at a club. Knowing Haise was going to be there. Knowing. They knew. Another example is Kanou needed a Q so they can analyze the surgery. How did Furuta know Kanou needed one? Because Furutas boss is partners with Kanou. I dont think Eto has a cell phone or Ayato or Tatara or Taki.Only person I see is Kanou. Furuta called Kanou hey someone in the Q died my boss said you needed a body.

In the legends  One potential king so desired the kingship that upon seeing that he was losing the race he cut off his hand and threw it to the shore and thus winning the kingship.

6117378,0,t1_cykysry,I can only think of one of those core things that IS apparently messed up relating to Tsukiyama becomingnot becoming a kakuja but after reading that speech I got the opposite impression that everyone else did that he couldnt become a kakuja. Until I saw people on reddit reading it as him becoming a kakuja at which point I just assumed that I must have missed something and went along with it. So I cant actually speak to the claims youre making right now as the only time thats happened to me wasnt because of bad translations but other peoples interpretations of those translations. I dont know if IS corrected it but when I reread Re recently I still got that same feeling so I dont know what Mirumo was translated as saying that gave everyone else that idea.In other words I cant speak to your claim as I dont know of any times Ive ever suffered from that problem.,TokyoGhoul,cykzdkb,1,t5_315h3

And I dont think its entirely impossible for Noro to be inside the Quinque as I recall Shinohara referred to the Arata armour being sluggish when fighting ayato. Most likely because of Arata which means some of his mind was still there. Although it was a Kakuja Qunique so it could be different. But I dont believe so. As for Noros statement I dont think it was some farewell. It seemed to significant and emphasised for it to be. Either this Other side is referring to somewhere or something that will happen.Also I think he purposely isnt going wild because there most likely would be many benefits to having someone in the CCG.

If u look at the picture of Washuus wife in the recent chapter and compare it to the chapter with the panel of Yoshimura revealing Noroi. The woman behind them looks similar to Washuus wife.Httpimgur.comIxfgCJ  And there is the thing that Washuu is calling her an old boring who pretends not to understand the work of him. Also Washuu says that the family of hers is an old family and in Tokyo Ghoul Ishida never mentions an old family and it isnt important to the plot. Furthermore in my original post you can see that in the calendar which is the st Washuu and his wife are drawn. But why has her face hiden? So there is more behind her story which Ishida is trying to forshadow. This theory could be totally shit but IMO it makes sense.,TokyoGhoul,czb1cxs,5,t5_315h3

Devoid of memories his preferences life choices and personality traits were in complete favor of her. Haise was unquestionably willing to bury the centipede in the rabbit hole. Unfortunately Eto stepped in and reprogammed  him to his original true tragic self which is  compatible with her and Toukaproof as Touka has little patience for the tragic hero shtick.  But unfortunately for Eto neo Kaneki only cares about his literal suicide mission romance with anyone is the least of his priorities  their similarities be damned. I am also uncertain what Eto is expecting unless she creates a situation in which Kaneki has no choice but to rely on her. Otherwise she will have to helplessly watch along with Touka as she gets NTRd by Kanekis awesome death. But given her keikaku status of late and her obvious plan of making him King  she is definitely scheming something. ,TokyoGhoul,czh4q5e,4,t5_315h3

Ghouls can inherit either both or only one of their parents Rc type and theres no telling what degree of variance the offsprings own Rc patten will have. The reason why it worked without a hitch for Eto and Kaneki is that Eto completely inherited Yoshimuras Rc type since hes her only ghoul parent and Kaneki straight up had Rizes kakuhou with an exact pattern match in the system. Who knows if someone like Hinami who would have both her parents patterns registered can get through our not.

6996180,0,t1_d19brnl,Perhaps some members believe that but I thought that the Tree was formed to oppose V and their puppet organization the CCG. The role of the OEK is to free ghouls from Vs oppression.Theres a lot of evidence that Kaneki is the OEK. The chapter where Kaneki fights Eto was called the Second King. This may mean that Eto was only temporarily taking the title of OEK until Kaneki is ready. When Eto states that she was not the OEK the next panel implied that Kaneki was the OEK. Eto says that the OEK is the belly. Most people agree that means within the prison the belly but it could also mean the OEK is a traitor among the CCG. The new prison director also says he feels nauseous because cochlea is like his body. The cause of the upset in the belly is Kaneki. Its also interesting that Kaneki is the centipede and the prison is called Cochlea a part of the ear. Im pretty sure Kaneki is the OEK.

In my original reply I placed classics in quotes so I never intended to cite Fairy Tail as  best mangas of all time or something like that.What would be a true classic in your mind? Dragon Ball would be undisputed but it ended long ago yes I am aware of the current DB Super series. The Sugoi Award is an annual contest and not of the best of all time nature. So it is fair to restrict our scope in time to mangas which are ongoing or ended recently.

7280174,0,t3_4f2gsl,Now heres my theory as we can see here   and here  the time has passed  by five days and because no more time stamps were given we can assume everything was real time till that second stamp so if we also assume kaneki started the cochlea raid on the  then the second time stamp is after the raid is over if we look at the wording of the conversation on the ship where they talk about not wanting the troops spirits to waver I think they heard the outcome of the raid and that either kaneki succeeded and arima failed or something along those lines has happened so by the time the rue island raid is done all who survived the cochlea raid will be long gone or they dont know the out come. This also shines light on mutsukis situation it took about five  sevenish days to break mutsuki and if the quinx take any longer to find mutsuki I fear for their mental state and life. KEEPMUTSUKISAFEEDIT I reread the panel and when he says im counting on you arima it has me a little confused as whether the cochlea raid started later and spanned a few days or it started on the th I still feel the raid on cochlea and the time stamp are a good few days apart so my theaory still stands just in brackets.,TokyoGhoul,d25pgz3,7,t5_315h3

Make sure you put a heat protectant first as heat can badly damage your hair if done too often. So basically. Start with damp hair. Apply matte product evenly start with dime size and use more if needed you shouldnt be using a lot unless your going for a tighter look like a classic pomp or slick back making sure they are applied to the roots and not the top.. Comb your hair to one side preferably with your part while your blow dryer follows. Once bone dry apply a little bit more product to style to desired shape and it should hold throughout the day unless you get it wet or consistently touch itIt would help a lot if I had a picture of your hair and face shape for clearer instructions.,TokyoGhoul,d2ya7wz,4,t5_315h3

7599578,0,t1_d35yrhr,Its becoming popular on tumblr to give Kaneki blueish eyes. Mostly since his white or back hair makes his normal gray look dead or plain and doesnt draw much attention do to his overall design being full of dark colors.Also its my motif to have a character with one blue eye as my icon since it means they are one of my favorites. Black amp yellow eyes refer to me.Edit Gee I guess trying to explain something simple is bullshit. Here what I meant From what I have seen from Tumblr blue is being used to make his eyes stand out compared to the monochrome colours he wears. His eyes are normally grey. As for the added bit I would have disaturated his eye more if I wasnt going to make him my icon. To add to that his eye would still look light blueish because of the yellows red and dark colours contrasting it. Hed look too flat otherwise since I didnt add shadowing.,TokyoGhoul,d3618dk,4,t5_315h3
7615456,0,t1_d35a9y4,I have a different feeling about the encounter.Either Furuta is gonna stomp Eto really hard and bring a stump to Kaneki or Eto is gonna show a different combat style as her gigantic form is better for fighting investigator rather than ghouls.We had a glimpse of how powerful in the entire manga and fast remember Banjou? she MAY actually be in a serious fight but while fighting Kaneki she wasnt fightning at all at most she was taunting and mocking him.Just my  cents Im probably wrong anyway.Bless Ishida.,TokyoGhoul,d37u5xn,2,t5_315h3

7653687,0,t1_d3bz4ue,If youve read Ajin its got a lot of similarities to that but Id say TGs execution is superior better characters more intricate plot more revolutionaryinteresting twists etc.. Parasyte too but less close than Ajin imo.EDIT More mainstream it has some similarities to Deadman Wonderland I guess? The predicament and evolution of the protagonist at least is similar to that of Kaneki to a point.Id say one of its main draws is the way the things you learned early on even supposedly unimportant ones have a way of coming back and with stuff youve learned since have a very different meaning. Twists and revelations are perfectly integrated into the story and its obvious they were planned since essentially the beginning but theyre not easily foreseeable at all. In this regard Id compare it to Pandora Hearts although imo TG does a lot more with metaphors and symbolism whereas PH is more about actual things characters say or do having a completely different meaning with new context. Of the two I prefer PH but TG is absolutely superb nonetheless.The way the protagonists mental state at any one time is woven into the narrative is something I dont think I know a good comparison for though. Kanekis psyche and the ways it changes is a crucial part of the story and Im not sure what other manga isare comparable in that sense.EDIT uJokAeger posted a way better writeup look at that lol,TokyoGhoul,d3c6jh3,6,t5_315h3

Arima couldnt care less about honour.Rather than being suicidal I think he was just bored out of his mind. Being at the top for  years must have been boring so hes elated at the idea of someone who could challenge him. To be defeated just naturally means death to him as theres really nothing left for a guy who dedicated his entire life to fighting and being at the top. To him the end result of defeat was always going to be death and if Kaneki wasnt going to do it then he had to do it himself its just more efficient in typical Arima style that way. He was trying to force Kanekis hand when he kept going with the broken quinque but he quickly realized had no intention at all to kill him and it would just drag on until people came. ,TokyoGhoul,d4nk2d9,1,t5_315h3

8408944,0,t3_4upbik,The Clowns are probably allies of Kaneki. At the end of TG people thought the Clowns helped to make Kanekis life a tragedy but theyve never been shown to directly manipulate him into harms way except for the time that Itori tricked him into going to the ghoul restaurant. Souta was the one who pushed the steel beams causing Kaneki to become the guinea pig for Kanous surgery but we dont know if the rest of the Clowns were in on it and Furuta cant be considered a true Clown. Im pretty sure Uta tried to screw Furuta over when he intentionally whispered to Mutsuki the operation is a failure no help will come so that Mutsuki and Juuzou began to suspect a Clown mole was in CCG. Donato seemed to know a while ago that Kaneki was special which is why he told Amon to chase alice and then for Haise to seek out Amon. I also think they have a thing against V for ordering the extermination of the Clowns. And then there is that thread a while ago talking about the clue for Kaneki being the OEK well look at who is putting that same mantle on Kaneki Clowns were trying to make Kaneki into the OEK long before Eto even showed signs of thinking about it.Back near the beginning Yomo asked Uta what the Clowns were intending to do to Kaneki and Uta responded he doesnt know what the boss is thinking. Donato is now outwhen he previously declined leaving Cochlea despite being able to when it was broken into the first time so now the Clowns will really begin to move.,TokyoGhoul,d5snvyc,5,t5_315h3

Pics are bad but Saiko did to him doesnt look survivable. It wasnt reported what the conclusion of the Qs fight was but if they all went home safe then it would be because Amon was already dead at the scene.

Put a detector where a lot of people pass  next to that detector couple of inspectors and see what happens not just do nothing and not use it for the reason they created it. This is a war that last for centuries  and the manga is treating this it is child play. That is problem and how can i take the manga seriously?Ghouls blood has something  more or something in their blood and Madou in that flashback asked that ghoul grandma for a blood test that she fixed. Instead of doing a mandatory test at the start when someone gets in the system. A lot of ploblems can be solved that way.

It was stupid situation and it cant be tragic.gtWhy would they need to conduct an investigation on Kanou when he quit like a long time ago? Well i dont know? Maybe  because police normally investigate the situations where two people are hurt in unknown circumstance especially when ghoul in on a rampage. Or maybe because the doctor made operation against the law and we found that doctor was part of CCG. No one asked Kaneki anything no one asked to see the body the dead girlas we thought then nothing.The interrogation part is bs. There is no need to question something you want to exterminate.

9612837,0,t3_5ck90h,What a thoughtful chapter. Tokyo Ghoul really works when its characters are shown interacting with one another. Lets take a look at the treat. Here we have Kaneki and Furuta assessing each other. Their conversation provides an insight into Furutas motivation. He wants to bang his halfsister. This does not faze Kaneki one bit and Furuta laughs at the randomness that brought about this entire situation. Furuta is in charge of the opposition and both he and Kaneki agree that its for the best. Next Take and Yomo finds common ground in coffee and Kaneki. I could see this pair making a fearsome duo in upcoming battles. Though Take at one point nearly decapitated Yomo Take states that Yomos need for revenge is pointless because the one he despises is dead. He is correct and both sides would have to put aside their grievances to face Furuta. Now TV transition!!The average age of CCG agents could be no more than . Maybe thats why nobody recognizes the Clown gang who is in no way affiliated with the OEK. CCG agents are surmising that Kaneki is behind the attack. By the time they realize the ongoing coup Furuta and Donato would be at the organizations helms. Kanekis sending the White Suits to make sure he bares no blame.The last scene depicts Nico showing up at the nick of time to hopefully teach Banjou how to save a human. Both Kaneki and Furuta are going to harshly learn why the Clowns arent to be trusted. Notes Furuta captured Rize farmed her kagune and drove her to insanity in order to keep her from seeing other men. Why did Torso die again? Furuta overheard Kaneki and Fukas conversation and responded Matsuri is literally buckling at the knees due to stressQuotesgt Rize You always smell so good Furuta.

Heavy on great dialogues slow paced lighthearted scenes a good balance of humor Saiko. And then you get Touka telling Kaneki that they will talk when he gets back. Touka dont! Dont jinx it! Theres also the confrontation between Ui and Matsuri where Ui should have definitely not stated his full support to the troll king so bluntly Im also very uncomfortable with Takeomi knowing Toukas name related to the th ward... Somethings gonna happen there... The name of the chapter itself is just dread inducing. And now the freaking clowns. Shit is about to hit the fan.  I cant wait to see whats coming specially the Lab raid which looks like its gonna be one of those arcs full of action but also key revelations fingers crossed for Arata but  theres a part of me that wants these fun relaxing chapters to last for a couple more weeks.

9903944,0,t1_daxr5gt,Youre right I am wrong about Yamoris kagune texture.And uh when did the manga state devouring kakuja means someone cant ever generate kakuja anymore.......? If devoured kagune people have recovered I am quite certain it is the case for kakuja. If CCG can study kagune from a kakuhou where is the logic behind them being unable to study a kakuja from it? Again the hype behind Jason XIII was that it was made out of a kakuja user.I didnt dodge the question at all. I literally answered it right in front of you then explained how that doesnt help your case at all. You certainly act like its fact though. Which is where I have issue with it. Me believing Hide is alive doesnt prompt me to shove that theory every time I feel its plausible to. The whole argument here just lost a lot of value you acknowledging you arent stating a fact is good enough.Your train of thought is not good. By your logic before Kaneki became SSS level everyone should say only Yoshimura bloodline can reach SSS level nobody else can because thats common sense. Which is hefty prejudging at a closeminded level imo. I disagree. Base Kaneki while beating Ayato did get hit a handful of times. Then he got absolutely dismantled like a toddler against SS rate Shachi. Twice. I believe he was a highend S rate but his kakuja gave the jump to SS.So Suzuya judged that because Kurona is a kakuja she must be SS level and he got it completely correct.I actually remember Arata was SS as well? I could be totally wrong. Perhaps it was his wife but up to this argument I always remembered him being SS. I was wrong before could be wrong again. If he is S though then isnt your assumption debunked now? Even one exception debunks the theory that kakuja are rated SS by law.How was saying your question was pointless insulting? Its a fact that was necessary to point out. You seem to think because I didnt give a name you won the argument. Thats like asking me who won the th SuperBowl in an argument about UFC champions and because I couldnt answer I Iost the actual argument....The whole argument practically ended the moment you admitted you dont believe it as fact. Youre right in never outright saying it but the way you used it like the common sense that it is heavily implies you firmly believed it was. Kakuja heavily implies that someone is SS or above and is almost a foregone conclusion that they are at minimum S. Im also quite confused with how we went about this. At some point in your response it felt like we agreed on something completely but the way we went about it was different admitting that almost all kakuja are SS level in strength. Before this post you never mentioned the fact you believed kakuja are SS level because of strength as well a big part of why I argued with you was that it felt like you believed some kakuja dont deserve their rating. Remember our old argument about how strong Suzuya is? You explicitly tried to discredit Kurona as an SS first via mentioning influence plays a factor in ratings I debunked that. Then it was that all kakuja get SS rating anyway so her rating could be overrating her in order to make the conclusion that Suzuya beating Kurona was not as impressive as it actually was. I guess you changed your mind.So you see where Im coming from right? Why your question was pointless? Your belief is that CCG instantly rates all kakuja SS because past experiences imply they are usually SS. My belief is that kakuja tend to be as strong as SS which is why CCG rates the majority of them as such. We agree on the same shit but have a different base priority yours being because they are kakuja mine being because they are genuinely SS. This is why your question was pointless I never not once disagreed with the fact CCG named most kakuja SS I simply disagreed with why the majority of kakuja are rated SS. Pointing out the fact that there are almost no names to list does not validate either of our causes.Again though the argument is pretty much done. I assumed which is bad on my part imo even if past experiences made it reasonable for me to believe you believe what you were saying were facts...yeesh weird sentence. Still I prejudged your case so my bad for that something you never outright said that its fact and have admitted that you were making an assumption. And Im quite sure I came off douchey somewhere so my bad on that too.,TokyoGhoul,dayi9of,2,t5_315h3

9976267,0,t1_db7h9s9, There is no evidence that she wasnt fed enough. There is also no evidence that the pate Furuta provided her with wasnt enough to give her all the strength she needed and more. So far every time ghouls have eaten to replenish themselves it has taken them two bites or less in order to power themselves up Touka vs Tsukiyama Kaneki vs Jason etc. The pate was about a dozen or two bites. Before you mention it RC suppressants as stated by Ayato put aside the many examples in the show inhibit ghouls from even moving properly put aside using their kagune. Etos Kakuja was at its greatest shape ever during the Cochlea fight. All of the evidence points towards her being in top shape and none of it points towards her being weakened. Getting surprise attacked by someone youre currently facing and fighting seems like a bad excuse for her loss. Not only is she SSS rated shes an Ukaku. Having such horrible reaction times to not even be able to respond to an attack coming from about at least a good  dozen metres is odd. Moreover as an artificial halfghoul with a Rize base Furuta smells like a female ghoul naturally Rize. She shouldve been aware that he was a ghoul. Why she Kaneki and even Hinami the sensory based ghoul appeared to be unaware of that is absolutely beyond me.,TokyoGhoul,db7xoyl,3,t5_315h3

10008111,0,t1_dbbtgnq,I actually interpretted the fight differently but Im aware my outlook isnt factualWhen Amon tooled Kaneki the moment he had his Armor Kaneki knew that if he doesnt use his extremely hard to control or even uncontrollable kakuja form he would die. Amon was not letting up and a theme that is for sure emanating from his side was that he had no choice but to have to kill Kaneki even when he didnt. I believe this was a theme emanating for both of them the moment Amon forced Kanekis hand to bring out that risky kakuja.While that part of the fight didnt last long you can see that Kaneki in his kakuja did not say a word at all in the fight until after the last attack where he himself was hit vitally which could effectively bring back complete consciousness again. We actually had many monologues from Amon right before their final clash. I believe if Kaneki was  conscious wed have gotten insight from him as well but we didnt until after they ended clashing.So basically by that point of the fight both of them tried their hardest. Kanekis thoughts in the end didnt particularly indicate that he didnt try to kill him but that he hoped he didnt kill him.All the times Kaneki has busted out that kakuja in TG has always caused him insanity before and after that Amon fight so I believe its very possible that was the case during their fight as well.That was Amons personal deduction though regarding his opinion that Kaneki helping Kuzen might turn the tide there. Amon was thinking worst case scenario. Remember that even CCG themselves did not know if they could even beat Kuzen but they did with no casualties in terms of bigname characters at all.I guess we can count fodder too in which yes Kaneki did beat many during the Raid but not all of them not even close. Several were still seen fighting Aogiri like Akiras squad for example. Kaneki only took out those who were in between his rescues. And if we wanna be fair Takizawa took out tons of fodder in Auction and Rue Island the same chain of fights as his TataraHoujiAmon one as well.,TokyoGhoul,dbc32z6,2,t5_315h3

Its probably been ages since someone had said something nice to her and gave her words of wisdom plus they underwent the same operation and are pretty much both tired and worn out from the life they live.

10732355,0,t1_ddmxpsm,I think the electric impulse does stimulate the Kagune to a degree which gives it its form otherwise it would be a regular ole Kakuhou. Not to mention they mend it with Quinque steel. The issue is thats only an artificial method of making it awaken due to lack of a body or an active RC cell supply I think.. That electricity if used on a ghoul might subdue their Kagune but they would still probably need to eat tbh. I figure RC suppressants are the real solution since the gas itself kills Kagune shape and reverts it to the gaseous state not to mention it weakens ghouls. You give a ghoul a concentrated dosage on their Kakuhou and they might just be a regular human. The only issue with this is the fact that the Kakuhou regenerates somehow as seen with farmed ghouls like Rize and Arata..? So tbh idk.,TokyoGhoul,ddmynaf,1,t5_315h3

10937230,0,t3_5w889s,gtTokyo Ghoul rrreeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!Mutsukis behavior in the last chapter might have been unexpected but it didnt come out of nowhere. I think the frustration lies somewhere between peoples misunderstanding of her gender identity and being portrayed as a violent rapist instead of a victim. Despite what some say Mutsuki has always been a female. She assumed the identity of a man because it served as a comfort blanket to shield her from past trauma she obtained after years of physical emotional and sexual abuse. Being seen as a woman makes her feel vulnerable and any attention she receives as a woman forces her to relive her past. Its no secret to the readers that shes a closet sociopath after it was exposed that she tortured and killed animals for pleasure during her years at the academy. She doesnt understand how to show love and affection since the only ones who showed her were her abusers  her father and Torso. She actively represses her emotions as seen with her reaction to Haise and Touka sharing an emotional moment. This latest chapter shows what happens when all those bottled up emotions of fear anger rejection affection and loneliness that she held on for years come rushing out in the worst way possible. edit Whoever did that probably saw Mutsuki as someone heshe could identify with. Perhaps that person projected hisher feelings towards the character developed a strong emotional connection then felt betrayed that it didnt turn out as expected. Even on this subreddit Ive seen enough people who misunderstood the reason for Mutsuki assuming a male identity so its not exactly unforeseen that there will be some backlash from this latest revelationconfirmation.,TokyoGhoul,de83k9d,236,t5_315h3

11012599,0,t3_5x8y16,Personally with all the characters in the series that do fight I think its pretty cool that Uta serves as a development device for characters he does fuck with instead of brawling. Hes also a central person in the clown organization typically when they annoy someone or keep tabs on them its solely to gain information or control the persons decisions so the clowns can eventually benefit from it for the most part.. I want to believe Uta is somewhat chill or at least friendly to the coffee shop gang but we have no real idea where his loyalty lies. At the end of the day he still does pretty twisted things to people as seen with Suzuya. I still want to know what he told Mutsuki since theyre heavily interacting at this given moment we may find out soon. I stumbled upon a theory that Uta may be toying with Mutsuki to groom her to be the next Kaneki if you remember he made Mutsuki a mask that looks pretty familiar to Kanekis. I wouldnt be surprised if he whispered to her during the auction Your going to be the next Kaneki Ken or some other insane shit knowing him. When it comes to Utas strength however theres no doubt hes big shit. His regeneration factor is impressive Hirako slashed his face at point blank range forcibly and he recovered in seconds and continued to troll. As far as kagune manipulation he seems to have a Kakuja and was said to have interest in it earlier in the series. We know he used to be wild as fuck back in the day but mellowed out for some reason..Backstory soon? No doubt hes around SS or a little higher in terms of power. Theres a popular theory that he dyes his eyes with black ink because hes secretly a one eyed ghoul this would be pretty interesting if so. ,TokyoGhoul,deg8wvp,3,t5_315h3

Haise really was a great character he was charismatic and fun all while still being a fucking bad ass!!!! I also loved the way Ishida drew him he seems to stand a little taller than Kaneki and also looks a bit older even handsome! while I think that Kaneki still looks a bit childish in some panels. I also thought that  the different moments where Haise was acknowledgingdenying Kaneki are some of the best of the series! The first few arcs of re are actually my favorite out of the whole series. That part of his character was very interesting to me. I think seeing him interact with some of the QS like he used to will help assure me that Haise wasnt just some momentary inconvenience but that he is actually still part of Kaneki.

I like how Ishida didnt continue throwing us between two conversations and wrapped the Mado issue in a single chapter beautifully but I cant help but feel uneasy.I feel uneasy about the Kaneki Furutas plans and what theyve done in these recent events to accomplish their goals. While Kaneki kills the king and takes his role Furuta takes out Eto the Washu clans and easily gets all eyes of the CCG on him as the next chief. While Kaneki steals a drug to help out Mado and fights off some clowns Furuta takes out Matsuri and claims the CCG. Makes the ghouls look even worse by using the clowns. And while Kanekis presumably chilling and Goat is dealing with internal issues Furuta kills Kaneki and brings  Qs with Rizes kagune. I mean... I know Kanekis a monster when it comes to combat and presumably even the strongest there is. Aside from his strong kagune he seemed to have a talent for martial arts and was able to dodge a master in handtohand combat with little to no training and force him to take significant damage in order to catch him.. He is a monster without a doubt but Furutas done far too much while  Kaneki hasnt.,TokyoGhoul,dfzpwri,17,t5_315h3

11536746,0,t1_dg3mrw6,gt Focus implies a single entitySame way cow implies a single cow. We can have multiple cows though no? Same way we can have multiple focused plot pointpointsgt there cant be multiple focuses because then there isnt a central focusThe central focus is the Fall of Aogiri in their final base Rue Islandgt What happened on rue was completely disconnected with what happened at cochlea.It was not completely disconnected. Both parts of the same Arc revolved around the Fall of Aogiri and the Rise of both Vs involvementexposition as well as Goats aka the rise of factions that will go to war. The giant Arc was both the conclusion of many things we questioned as well as the foundation of many other things we will question.gt Thats why we refer to them as two separate arcsI alongside quite a handful of others probably half the sub? consider the two the same Arc. It happened at the same time and one event would literally be impossible without the other event.gt Every arc is based around kens struggleI remember some people me included wishing we saw the Cochlea Raid during the Aogiri Tree Arc of the original as well as the Quinque Steel Transport Attack during the Auction Arc.Cochlea Raid happens again but this time we finally get the other side of the war and Im more than happy we did. And for good reason. There were way too many big names on the other side to just ignore.And again the CochleaRushima Raid Arc aka the same Arc did base around Kens struggle. Without the Rushima Island as the big distraction Kaneki and Eto...and Arima wouldnt have had the proper time to act on their gameplan.gt but then half way through the story they dont appear for an excessive amount of time and the story starts jumbling between characters and plot points.You mean a measly  chapters? Your analogy doesnt work because   the story with the focus being about a relationship implies that anything else besides that is completely irrelevant. This is not the case with Tokyo Ghoul. Everything besides Kaneki is not completely irrelevant.gt I understand that Tokyo ghoul has a ton of characters but thats more of a criticism than a justification. Too many characters derails the main focus of the story.Agree to disagree wholeheartedly here. I find it unbelievably better that Tokyo Ghoul has this many importantinteresting characters. Knowing what I know now I would be severely disappointed if we didnt get the Amon Urie Mutsuki Seidou Akira Saiko Suzuya Kurona moments that all happened last Arc.The rest of your post is again obviously derived from the belief that Rueshima Raid was a separate Arc. This is the foundation of where we differ you think they are two separate Arcs I think that they are the same Arc. We just get to see the other side of things unlike the Aogiri and Auction Arcs where we missed out on it.This also tempted me to explain the major thing about Tokyo Ghoul and its central focus....There are two major driving forces of the Tokyo Ghoul World The Struggle of Ken Kaneki character driven and The Actual Plot Going On plot driven. How it was handled at least how I perceive it was that the story initially gave off the impression that this was plot driven.Meaning what shined the most early on was The Actual Plot Going On.Only until the Aogiri Tree Arc did people begin to realize that The Struggle of Ken Kaneki was a lot more important at the time. This is why Ive argued with two people before about how TG lost its focus on trying to make harmony between ghouls and humans! These two users I believe they were a part of this sub considered that criticism on TGs part for losing its original and main purpose.The reality is that no TG did not lose its original purpose. The original driving force of TGs story has always been about Kens struggles and developments. Where he was mentally and physically at the time JUST SO HAPPENED to be at a time where he wanted to bridge the gap between ghouls and humans was around ghouls and humans who pushed forward that goal etc.The plot driven force took a back seat to the character driven force since early on and has been that way all the way up to re chapter .The plot of TG is vast with huge depth and insane detail. But it was always just the background for Kanekis struggles. Why?Because of how severely flawed Kaneki is. Kaneki cant save the world without cleaning up his own act first right? When re chapter  came out Kaneki has gone so far in his selfrealizationexpositiondevelopmentwhateveryoucallit that his struggles priority is now no longer significant enough when compared to the plot driven focus which starting at the early s of re with revelation after revelation began taking the front seat again.This is why Rue Island and even the entire Clown Arc had barely much focus on Kanekis character development because Kaneki has reached a point where his development is almost over it might already be over while the plot kept thickening and thickening to the point its way too big to play second fiddle anymore.There is a natural and organic reason as to why eventually the story has become just as plot driven as it is character driven.And even then during the long reign that was Kanekis character driven focus being top priority there were short instances of other characters being the main driving force. There were like  chapters in a row postAogiri that were largely Amon driven same way Urie took a lot of spotlight during re.gt but none of it connects to Ken which is the central focus of the story.Rushima very much connects to Ken. It just doesnt connect to him in a character development way. It connects to Ken in a plot way.The logic that Rushima was bad because it doesnt focus with Kens struggle is rather selective in nature. When Touka and Hinami fought Mado when Shinohara Hirako and Kuroiwa fought Kuzen when Suzuya fought Kurona and Nashiro when Suzuya Shinohara Houji Ui and Kuroiwa fought Kuzen and Eto when Suzuya Mutsuki and Urie fought Big Madam when Shirazu and Saiko fought Nutcracker when Shirazu Urie Mutsuki Takeomi and Saiko fought Noro when Shachi fought Arima among so many other completely not related to Kens struggles fights happened did they all deserve criticism for not focusing on Kanekis struggles?gt The things that happen on rue are important obviouslyYou even admit this. So again I stand by my point its at least largely the readers part for wanting more Kaneki while largely ignoring all the plot threads that have been seeded so long ago that happened on Rushima for their displeasure.Kaneki is by far my most favorite fictional character in anything ever. Yet Im totally okay with him losing some focus for other great characters to shine?I feel its less Rushima sucks because the central focus is gone and more Rushima sucks because the focus that I want to see specifically and personally is gone.CochleaRushima Raid was an Arc with multiple plot threads with no clearcut  overall focus. It would be bad writing on Ishida if he made the entire series dependent on whether it has to heavily relate to Kaneki or not. That limits creativity and freedom on a rather large scale. The character driven focus found in TG is compelling enough to be independent same way the plot driven focus is deep and wellwritten enough to be independent as well. What makes TG special is that it has both.,TokyoGhoul,dg3oxqi,3,t5_315h3

11596624,0,t3_65i6oq,I know the hot topic is going to be the last panel with Touka but personallymy favorite part was the exchange between Kaneki and Akira. I feel so bad for Kaneki. Some might find Akira hitting him funny in the way it was drawn but its quite sad really. Kaneki always being physicallymentally abused by the people he loves. Abused by his biological mother and later on watching her die as he couldnt do anything. Then mentally abused and cast aside by his aunt and her family only for trying hard to earn their affection. Ken was beat up numerous times by the only father figure he had Arima and watched as he killed himself in front of him. Beat up quite a bit by Touka herself. The scene when she batters him on the bridge was heartbreaking as well back in pt.. Now denied by his second mother as well... Such a tragic character. The face he made when he told his imaginary Hide he was so lonely without him... and now even after he reunited with his friends from Anteiku we learn hes still feeling so alone. He gained so much power he is one of the strongest ghouls if not the strongest yet hes only been losing things precious to him all this time. Seems like the hole Hide left in Kaneki after he disappeared is just too big to fill. I guess only Hide himself can fill it in the end.I like how we get a bit more information on that infamous oneeyed ghoul.So heshe litterally almost wiped out the whole CCG.

Akira said harsh things but then gave him a Mado punch which can be seen as a sign of familiarity and said there was still something she liked about him. It makes me think her harshness in turning Kaneki away was a justification to herself but then she tried to reassure him in some way that they were still good and would see each other again. ,TokyoGhoul,dgb6shm,10,t5_315h3

11685463,0,t1_dgkhnmc,In chapter  of TG it is revealed Hide was the anonymous informant who had tipped the CCG off about Aogiris hideout. I think his narration of it to Marude and what really happened was different  From what he told Marude he placed a tracking device on Yamori followed him into the th Ward and when he found out it was full of ghouls he stole a dead ghouls clothes to disguise himself and escape.  His memories however show he disguised himself first where in the world did he get a ghouls clothes then followed Yamori and Nico into Anteiku pretended to drop some coins and placed a tracking device on Yamori as he picked them up. Then in Bible the first story of Tokyo Ghoul Days Hide buys himself time while being chased by a ghoul by stuffing a rice ball down his throat first so he cant breathe. Then when he manages to throw it back up he goes back and makes him swallow meat sauce which is harder to throw up because its liquid so being human food it weakens him and then investigators arrive and kill him. And he knowingly did those two things in that order because... Hide is shady as hell. ,TokyoGhoul,dgkkc83,5,t5_315h3

11688526,0,t3_66q17t,I think it will tie back to Noroi the person Noro was before his transformation and his background. I think Noroi was part of a ghoul religioncult. That they know advance kagune techniques like healing techniques which Kanou might be using. Which were taught to Eto and she used on Noroi to try to bring him back. I think even Donato might have ties to this organization due to him being a former priest and his top tier kagune abilities. uThatGus wrote this post  talking about how Mougan could be used. Mougan in his bio thinks he is sensitive to the supernatural. If Furuta starts bringing people back I think he will trick people into thinking they are normal but like you said they will be mindless reanimated corpsesdrones. And Mougan will be able to sense it. Because Furuta is messing with their bodies they cant move on or he knows its a trick.,TokyoGhoul,dgkwuon,3,t5_315h3

11731278,0,t1_dgpmbxm,gtKamii UniversityKanou liked to lecture and hang around there. It was also where his latest assistant Kimi was attending so he likely recruited her then. Kaneki learned from his interrogation with Madam A that Kanou had a bodyguard and since the revelation that Furuta was Kanous Clown we can conclude that the only one that could have been his bodyguard would be Furuta himself at that point of time  especially since they had been collaborating since the very beginning with Furuta being the reason Kanou was able to experiment with Rizes kakuhou. Its also notable that Furutas clown identity Souta was always around Madam A during the Ghoul Restaurants. Madam As reaction to the bodyguard is also curious since Furuta hadnt gotten the kakuhou transplant surgery yet so her confusion about whether he was human or a ghoul makes perfect sense. Therefore why Furuta was at Kamii University is because he was keeping an eye on Kanou. ,TokyoGhoul,dgprrd0,15,t5_315h3

11790490,0,t3_6884u8,I find that the transitional chapters tend to follow a kind of structure but when theres a really pivotal scenes then he will break that structure to put it at the front. I think he does this to pace things and get stuff out of the way since theres so many characters and sides to cover now. Its not a bad thing nor does it make the actual content predictable but it does dampen excitement a bit if done too much. This is why I thought the entire Clown arc was a bit boring because it was a whole lot of transition with not much with bigger implications happening.Cliffhangers at the end of every chapter are a standard thing though especially in manga that have a constantly moving plot so no complaints about that.,TokyoGhoul,dgwhpns,6,t5_315h3
11800780,0,t1_dgxeng4,Hmmm. Interesting point. Hes one of my favorite characters now but Ill admit I didnt give him the time of day before re. Id venture a guess that people enjoyed his snuggly sort of weakling human Kanekiesque qualities and that he was a good foil to the pretty serious Amon and Akira. Even now I appreciate how his goony tendencies add a bit of levity. Id also venture a guess that some people identified with human Takizawa. He has so many fears and insecurities. And Im sure the bickering with Mado was fuel for the ship flame which helps a character in terms of likeability.But now for sure Takizawas journey has been one of the most satisfying for me to watch. I find it reminiscent of Evey from the V for Vendetta comics shes an absolutely irksome character but it just makes her changes that much more affecting.,TokyoGhoul,dgxnqtu,1,t5_315h3
