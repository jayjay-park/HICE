10990438,0,t3_5wmz9a,I have a B S with k on it and I love it. If you find a one owner and do all the scheduled maintenance I personally have had no issues at all with it. Mine had all the maintenance records from the dealership which was amazing. And it helps to buy from an older seller and hopefully they didnt beat it to much. The Turbos are the main thing to look for to be in good condition and if its a high mileage car make sure the timing chain and water pump tensioner ext was done on time and by a reputable shop. I got mine a few years ago with k on it one owner the guy was old and took care of it. ,AudiS4,dedqc8u,1,t5_2y9h8
