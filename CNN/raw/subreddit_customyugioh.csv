4076301,0,t3_33b5n8,Interesting deck man this seems kind of like a more consistent charmer deck. If you havent played charmers they have attribute based mind control and deck SSing. Are you looking for any feedback or anything?,customyugioh,crkxalf,1,t5_30bpz

8275880,0,t3_4sfuvq,Iconic Monsters that could be Toons as well as a neat effect based on its use in the anime with other cards. going by per anime characters signature monster.Toon Mechanic abbreviations for summary use. Sum Sick cannot attack the turn it is summoned. NoTW NoLife If Toon World is destroyed then it too is destroyed. This one doesnt really apply to newer toon monsters any more so I dont use it often. TWAtk Dir if toon world is out then it can attack directly.Toon Flame Swordsman. Fire  |  Stars Warrior  Toon  Effect Fusion  Toon Monsters. Sum Sick TWAtk Dir. If you control toon world this card gains  ATK. Salamandra like effect ATK DEF.Tips instant fusion can pop this guy out toon kingdom can prevent its destruction while you wait for the unstacked summoning sickness to end. Or you can just XYZ. o.oToon Time Wizard. Light |  Stars Spellcaster  Toon  Effect Sum Sick TWAtk Dir. Once per turn You can toss a coin and call it. If you call it right destroy all monsters your opponent controls. If you call it wrong destroy as many monsters you control as possible and if you do you take damage equal to half the total ATK those destroyed monsters had on the field. ATK DEFTips Im sorry but do you see this cool effect combo where you can basically destroy all you foes monsters half the time then just mill yourself the other half? This card is totally meant to be a toon. Toon Jinzo. Dark |  Stars Machine  Toon  Effect Sum Sick NoTW NoLife TWAtk Dir. Trap Cards and their effects on the field cannot be activated. Negate all Trap Card effects on the field. ATK DEFTips If you dont feel like playing traps why the hell would you not toon brief case and mask are excellent then you can capitalize on a trap oppressor who can attack directly. You foe will still have their monsters and spells to battle with so its not terribly OP. Especially since most decks dont run on traps anymore. Siding one or two would still be a good idea.Toon Magician of Faith. Light |  Star Spellcaster Toon  Effect Sum Sick TWAtk Dir. Flip target  spell card in your Graveyard return that target to your hand. You can only activate the flip effect of Toon Magician of Faith once per duel. ATK DEFTips save toon kingdoms from the bottomless pit of despair. But since regular magiain of faith is banned in the ocg for god knows what reason. Like... theres already a million recycling cards that do better than this weak a flip effect monster.Toon Harpie Lady. Wind |  Stars WingedBeast  Toon  Effect Sum Sick NoTw NoLife TWAtk Dir. When this card is summoned faceup while you control Toon World you can target  spell or trap card on the field and destroy it. ATK DEFTips This emulates the harpies hunting ground effect while being supported by other harpie cards. And it does a removal. Now find a way to special summon  of them at once and youve got a quick removal of  of your foes cards. Not much else going for it though.Toon Harpies Pet Dragon. Wind |  Stars Dragon Toon  Effect Sum Sick NoTw NoLife TWAtk Dir. This card gains  ATK and DEF for each Harpie Lady on the field. ATK DEFTips Similar to how toon dark magician girl gets strength from any old dark magician this dragon gets power from any old harpie lady. That earlier mentioned toon decoy dragon could get this bad boy out if you wanted to run a bunch of harpie lady toons as some neat deck alternative to normal toons. Toon Elemental HERO Neos. Light |  Stars Warrior  Toon  Effect Sum Sick NoTw NoLife TWAtk Dir. While you control Toon World You can special summon this card from your hand by shuffling two monster cards you control back into the deck. ATK  DEF   Tips. Wasnt sure what to do with this card honestly. I didnt want to create a toonneo spacian archetype with a million neo scpacian rips. To make is easier on the tributing and to emulate a little bit of contact fusion he can be special summoned by sending to cards to the deck whereas other old toons just tribute. Hes not the most useful. A hybridized toon and elemental hero deck would profit from this kind of neos since its tributes go back to the deck. But its still not the best.Toon Stardust Dragon. Light |  Stars. Dragon  Toon  Syncro  Effect  Tuner monster   or more nontuner monsters. Sum Sick NoTw NoLife TWAtk Dir. While you control Toon World during either players turn when a cards you control would be sent back to the hand or deck by a card effect you can send this card from the graveyard and negate the activation of that effect and if you do destroy it. During the end phase of the turn this cards effect was activated and was not negated you can special summon this card from the graveyard. ATK DEFTips ok so... its not exactly a stardust dragon rip but theres a purpose. Stardust dragon can protect your toon kingdom from being sent back to the hand or deck which is very likely because castel is so common. Its restrictions prevent it from attacking when its first special summoned but thats no big deal since its effect is really defensive in nature anyway.Toon Synchron. Dark |  Stars. Machine  Toon  Tuner  Effect Sum Sick NoTw NoLife TWAtk Dir. When this card is summoned while you control Toon World you can target  level  or lower Toon monster in your graveyard and special summon it in defense position but its effects are negated. It cannot change position even by card effect. This card cannot be used to synchro summon a nonToon card. ATK   DEF Tips Ok so another card not an exact rip. The reason its  stars or lower is so that you can target a level  toon to get out toon stardust. Since toons are mostly high level cards it would be a nightmare and a half for a level  or  since those dont even exist unless you comic hand them. You pretty much have to synchro summon though being unable to change the position or use the effect of the toon summoned is a restriction in itself. Should you choose ti play defensively TK can protect your extra summon and should TK be destroyed the extra summons effect is already negated so you can keep a card out if it has that NoTK NoLife restriction.I thought about other toon synchros of iconic nature but I was a bit stumped. Toon Ancient Fairy dragon is worth mentioning but its not super iconic. Red dragon archfiend and Black Rose dragon are completely counter productive if their effects are pure rips. Trying to adjust their powers to target nontoon cards makes sense but still has a few kinks of OPness or haphazardness. Toon Stardust and Toon Synchron would have very very tiny text on their cards. A need for summarizing their effects arises when one would actually go about making a card for them.Thoughts? Criticisms? Lemme know what you think about this shitty bastards.,customyugioh,d5c1kxd,1,t5_30bpz
8554337,0,t1_d6auzgl,Thank you for the critiques ill try to rework them with these things in mind.,customyugioh,d6av7cc,1,t5_30bpz
10381750,0,t3_5olgb7,You managed to give it just that little boost it needed to really seem worth running avoided making it stupidly powerful in the process and theres also some nice potential synergy between the two effects now.  Well done.,customyugioh,dcku3b9,2,t5_30bpz
