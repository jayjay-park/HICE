8140897,0,t3_4qn89u,Maybe he made mistakes. Maybe some mistakes were intentional because he was being ironic. This blogpost however doesnt prove Wallace wrong any more than any descriptivist essay proves a prescriptivist essay wrong. Like it or not there are two entrenched positions here. Neither can deliver the death blow. As stated above Wallace had more credentials than just being a famous writer. This blogpost glosses over that because the writer is seeing red regarding elitism and linguistic unfairness and wants to destroy Wallace and his argument. Neither happened.,infinitesummer,d4v5ohw,1,t5_2x8vb
