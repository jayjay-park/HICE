Do we have to provoke them once more and under false pretences and lies at that? Just a few days ago Sigmar Gabriel our new foreign minister gave an interview in Moscow in which he was asked why German troops are stationed on Russian borders and if he approved of it he answered with a question as to why Russia is stationing military in the Baltic region and said that Russia started this a bold faced lie.Merkels open door migrant policy which has a hundred different reasons behind it the one they officially stated is unsurprisingly not one of them. This policy is responsible for the exponential rise of crime which is being covered up by the underreporting media we have witnessed everything from rape to beheading of German nationals to mass murder.Lets not forget the support of some of the wars Merkel provides to the US and NATO illegally which is responsible for this migrant crisis in the first place.Merkels neoliberal policies have deepened the chasm between the poor and the rich exponentially.What my country is doing to Cyprus and Greece is just inhuman. The entire EU project is an utter and complete failure it benefits us or more accurately our corrupt elites and barely anyone else we are responsible for the problems in the southern EU states which are defaulting one by one and make them pay for it by imposing ineffective austerity measures which create poverty and in fact grow debt in the end.The coming financial crash will have long term repercussions for Germany especially with our demographics which are about to fall off a cliff and plunge our entire economy into a crisis we have never seen before. My government knew this for decades which is why they have pushed the EU expansion so aggressively they knew it would create an influx of immigrants to keep the boat from sinking just yet. In the s they opened up the borders to the southern European states in the s they allowed people from Russia and exSoviet satellites who have German ancestors to return to Germany. In the ts they opened up the EU to eastern Europe and now we have the middle eastern and African migrant crisis to keep the decade long tradition of loan dumping artificially creating a permanent class of poor people. When you hear people in the US bring up Germany as the shining example of a developed country which still has a huge manufacturing industry thats the reason we still have this huge manufacturing industry because of these migrant waves which keep the loans from going up so they can keep the factories running despite the hike in corporate tax and regulations. All a long term plan to combat the decline in birth rates and as a consequence the influx of warm able bodies to keep the economy going which will ultimately fail when a huge wave of people retires in the coming years and nobody is there to replace them thats in addition to the global financial crash when the bubble the stimulus money inflated ultimately bursts very soon.,unfilter,dex4uf0,1,t5_2tt3p
11186187,0,t3_5zpeap,Without the alternative minimum tax which President Trump wants to end he would have paid taxes at a lower rate than Americas poor.As a presidential candidate Donald Trump bucked the longstanding tradition of releasing his tax returns and as president he continues to hold firm. MSNBCs Rachel Maddow opened a small window of insight into Trumps tax history when she revealed a few pages of his  returns on her show Tuesday. According to the White House which confirmed the report Donald Trump earned over  million in  and paid  million in taxes that year. We got the two pages of Trumps  form today from a Pulitzer Prizewinning investigative journalist whos better on financial matters than almost anybody else in the business Maddow opened. His name is David Cay Johnston.The documents showed up mysteriously in Johnstons mailboxand Johnston who joined Maddow on her show Tuesday hasnt ruled out the possibility that President Trump leaked them himself. Whats most important about this tax return ... is that under the regular tax system remember we have two tax systems welltodo people you and I file effectively calculate our tax twice the regular tax system and the alternative minimum tax he explained. If we didnt have the alternative minimum tax and Donald Trump in writing wants to end the alternative minimum tax he would have paid taxes at a lower rate than the bottom half of taxpayers the poor in this country who make less than  annually Johnston revealed. Think about that he continued.  million almost of income he would have paid a little over  million less than . percent less than the half of taxpayers who make under .,unfilter,dezxw81,1,t5_2tt3p

They source from both sides. I dont spend as much time as you in this sub reddit but I do listen to the show. I can understand that as an American you might be a bit frustrated with whats going on in your country and that you have a certain believe and want to persuade people of that. But looking at your post and comment history it seems like you are on some kind of war path.,unfilter,df9e2d8,1,t5_2tt3p

It creates a narrative around which an external enemy can be created and then blamed for the nations problems or used as a threat to distract from said problems.  Fix healthcare?  House the homless?  Give treatment to the addicted?  Rebuild our crumbling bridges and roads?  Sorry we got a war to fight lest we loose our freedom but the joke is that we lost it a long time ago not to some foreign invaders but by the very people that promised us prosperity.,unfilter,dfjl55j,4,t5_2tt3p

He is a born Syrian and now regularly appears on German media though he doesnt get invited to corporate and state media any more after saying the German government supports headchopping terrorists not moderate rebels.,unfilter,dfw1dcr,1,t5_2tt3p

11669485,0,t3_66i9ib,I wonder how Chris has difficulty in drawing a distinction between Colbert playing a character and Alex Jones playing a character.For one Colbert is satire and there has been no question as to whether what Colbert says in character is what the real Colbert believes. Jones on the other hand is claiming to be playing a character while embroiled in a court case after a whole career of claiming these beliefs are actually his own legitimate beliefs. Make no mistake Joness custody battle is only news because he is now making this claim.EDIT Plus its pretty disgusting that you can lump what happened to OReilly in with whats happening with Alex Jones. OReillys support withered away in the face of reports of how much money had been paid out on account of his sexual harassment. The fact that him and Alex Jones both supported Trump is incidental to the stories themselves. I get being critical of the media but there are so many legitimate things to point out that you shouldnt have to turn to conspiracy every time you report on something. Honestly its beneath you.,unfilter,dgir2s1,7,t5_2tt3p
