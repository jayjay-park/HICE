They will sync with your GPOs once every  minutes or so but it would be best to grab a client machine and do a forced gpupdate to be sure. Then gpresult r to see what exactly is applied to the machine.After that you just need to push a reconfiguration to the machines.The CWindowswindowsupdate.log after a wuauclt detectnow will have info at the very bottom of the log showing you where its trying to pull updates from. ,windowsserver2012,deyfe0q,1,t5_2wecj
