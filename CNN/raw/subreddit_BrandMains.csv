7378150,0,t1_d2gu4no,Yeah I read your other post. You did a great job of putting all the numbers together dont get me wrong. But all those ratios and bases are currently on the PBE. Thats what the PBE is there for to test out how things are balanced and new things that they want to add. If it comes out that Brand is shit tier hell be adjusted because unlike when a champ like urgot or yorick is shit this is coming with their mage update so if they release a new shit champ it looks bad on them. Ive played brand for three seasons now about x as many games as any other champion. Theyre taking power out of brands solo laning and moving it into his team fighting. Its not difficult at all to land multiple passive procs in team fights. If people want to never group up because theyre afraid of brands teamfighting then thats a win for your team not a loss.,BrandMains,d2guejl,1,t5_390dg

8217035,0,t1_d54leir,I also only recently picked Brand up again played him a lot previous seasons I tried him one game after MYMU and didnt like him that they nerfed his lane presence. But I like his potential passive damage so yeah started playing him again.   Yeah I also run cdr blues  . But changing out sorcs at lategame for lucidity is bad imo you need that CDR asap for midgame. CDR is very core on Brand and I feel like you should always be aiming to max it. Thats why I like morellos  from runes from abyszhonya or blue buff. And I dont feel that just because passive has a cd that CDR is less useful for Brand. As I mentioned previously people will often take fights with you knowing they can survive your initial burst and think they can kill you after but if you have high cdr you just stun them again and kill them before they kill you. But I still try to play him like a lane bully thats just my playstyle for all champs. Ever since his passive change I stopped using only Ws to poke since the burn isnt so great anymore i feel like its a waste. I try to always get a Q or E off before I W to get that bonus dmg and if you do get it you immediately have huge pressure and can zone since no way the enemy will stick around and take that passive dmg. And if you manage to EgtW its actually pretty easy to chase and land the Q as the enemy is running away. I feel like thats the optimal way to play him now instead of just playing passive and farming up. ,BrandMains,d54onmx,1,t5_390dg
9377629,0,t1_d94gweq,Not quite. It priorities getting  blaze stacks on someone so if someone already has  stacks it will look for different champs to blaze instead of hitting the person. If its a v with minions the ult will still target the champ with  stacks bc theres nobody else to stack on. ,BrandMains,d94oiq2,3,t5_390dg
10046767,0,t3_5j2ix0,I think that the monthly v winners should get a special flair effect. Like a golden border or something thatll expire at the end of the month. I dont know i think it would be pretty cool.,BrandMains,dbh4b8k,2,t5_390dg
10363257,0,t3_5n2mqj,I mean he had a support orianna...,BrandMains,dciqj5p,1,t5_390dg
10471654,0,t1_dci94s7,Brand mid is not viable in higher elo. If u want to tell me im wrong check out his mid lane play percentage on lolking. I mean he still kinda works to higher plat but he is a bad pick. ,BrandMains,dcv2iox,0,t5_390dg
11083493,0,t1_deo80i6,Brand definitely scales harder off penetration and not raw AP especially support Brand. Deathcap is best a very last item on him and for mid Brand exclusively.,BrandMains,deoayjl,2,t5_390dg
