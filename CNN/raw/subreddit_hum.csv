I stage dove give me a break I was  or  twice during Hums set and lost a shoe at that one. Otherwise it could have been a courtyard show at the Six Pack which sounds a bit like your description but I swear it was  and dont think Hum played Blue Meanies didYes that is the place it was at.Scott Cochran is a piece of shit and I pissed on the framing of his house while it was being built...if he still lives there.Braid was far and away my favorite band growing up. I used to stand outside the Blind Pig oooooold Blind Pig and watch them play in HS if no one could sneak me in. ,hum,czxo3q2,2,t5_2xfkx

6716489,0,t3_47b747,I dont have a problem with this song musically its just a nice little soft song. What I find odd about the song is that it was the only song on the album recorded at Pachyderm Studio in Minnesota why would they record the entire album in Chicago only to go and record this one little song all the way in the middle of nowhere and with sub par recording techniques and mistakes in the final recording? Ive heard that they might have aborted one previous recording session of YPAA and this song was the only thing they kept from those sessions but Ive found no really evidence to support that. ,hum,d0e1kb5,5,t5_2xfkx
