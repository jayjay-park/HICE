341966,0,t3_1xznbd,My first weekend sounds a lot like yours it was really tough because during the week I had class and other things to distract me from gaming but on the weekend I didnt really know what to do. I wont lie I did a LOT of TV watching. I wasnt proud of it but it was all I felt like I could do. As time went on I realized there were a lot more things I could do that I hadnt really thought of or felt comfortable doing.A big part of figuring out what to do is learning to step outside of your comfort zone. For me going out to a bar was way outside of my comfort zone. I called up a friend and she and I went out and had drinks and it really wasnt so bad so I did it again and then again and now its not a big deal at all.It does get easier the longer you stick with it and it will be difficult at first but dont give up and the rewards far outweigh anything that gaming could have ever given you.,StopGaming,cfg7q7m,2,t5_2tjkc

I watched a lot of Tedx during my self reflection to get different viewpoints and started watching channels on more successful people after I stopped gaming for ideas on where to go. If you havent heard Eric Thomas speak I suggest you look him up on youtube. Some of the stuff he says will give you a really solid view on where you might want to be. He combines the goods of a preacher without the religion if that makes any sense.Tony Robbins was another good one too he uses a lot of NLP neurolinguistic programming methods in his I noticed. And the reason I bring this up is because emotional control is something that I really put high on my priority list and NLP can be used to control that.

In itself looking at art from Blizzard is no problem but it could perhaps present some temptation. Perhaps give yourself a little ritual before viewing anything. Take a few deep breaths and quietly tell yourself that you will not game nor feel the the urge to game while looking at the images. Even stick a note to the computer or write it on your mouse hand!

The greatest benefit of not playing video games for several hours a day is that you have so much time to do other things instead. Invest the time finding things you like doing!If youre having trouble finding things to do heres a list of stuff that I try to do on a regular basis Exercise Read selfhelp philosophy fiction books and personal finance blogs Socialize with friends or plan to at least Spend time with family Study if youre a student  Ive had less stress and have been performing well in school without the time constraints Ive had when I still played video games Walking outdoors experiencing the fresh airThese are just some of the things I personally do. Even then if youre still struggling try to have a goal you want to achieve in life and aim in obtaining success in achieving that goal whatever it is. That way you wouldnt feel like youre wasting any of your time. If your goal is to a be a great artist practice art without thinking that it is a mindless time sink.

3161786,0,t1_copnj25,Yes I was taking into consideration playing with moderation due to his video too. I have been getting so bored for the past weeks withouth an alicient. I am playing right now because I need to get a really good new hobby or achieve social stable circles that keep me occupied and happy but right now this is not possible or I havent yet found them so I am going to play with the MOST caution. In any case I am responsible for any relapse and going to inmediately stop this if I feel like losing control. I have been almost a year clean and Im not going to fall easily. My though on gaming addiction is that you need to cover what videogames have covered until then on your life. I didnt well and in my actual life rhythm I am almost all the day working I need some sort of alicient so playing a little will be beneficial again just  hoursweek. I have counted even the number of maximum games I can play  counting every game is  minutes. After two days I have wasted  games out of  and today I have played no games. Also I will not play before doing all the important chores. Im  years old I thank you for your advices.

3278770,0,t3_2xoq48,I think I quit a week or so ago? I was hardcore in to first person shooters of any kind and about the same off as you. I think I would play from the time I got out of school  to about am and any time I wasnt playing I would be on the forums or subreddits or watching youtube videos.I finally quit. Cold turkey. I pack all my games up canceled my Live membership and unsubbed from anything to do with gaming. And none of it helped.Finally I decided to start working out. Granted this was a week agoish but omg. I love it. Its addicting and there is amazing results already. Which comes to my grand revelation...We Gamers are addicts. We have highly addictive personalities which is a scary thing if you fall for the wrong things. Video Games while not as bad as drugs or alcohol etc are HIGHLY addictive. So what does an addict do to replace the thing they loved? Find a new healthier addiction.Since I started working out I went and got a gym membership two days after and have not missed a day yet. I work out now browse fitness and health subreddits and am absolutely in love with my new hobby. I dont even think about video games because I just love knowing and learning more about fitness now.This turned out longer than I thought but I hope you take something from it. Find a new hobby one that is good for you and youll find so enjoyable that you wont even think about your old one. Cooking hiking working out fixing computers anything. Your confidence will increase your focus will increase and your personal relationships will increase.TLDR Find another hobby and preferably one thats healthier for you. Unsub from all the old gaming forums and subreddits and fill your front page with posts about your new hobby or other interesting things. Soon enough you wont even look back.P.S. Good luck man. Im still working on it myself but so far so good. Hope everything in life goes well for you and you can find something awesome to do with your newly established free time.

Just dont do it. ampnbsp Lastly words do matter to you and others if you believe youre going to be afraid and relapse and fail then you will you need to believe in yourself and convince yourself that you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe Erich thomas and your commitment is to yourself mainly and to your family and the hole world  you want to be the best person you can be for this planet that time you could spend playing VG could be used to develop spacetravels methods that help us advance our species yeah i know far fetched thoughts just putting it in perspective nothing is impossible. ampnbsp So thats it now get up be the man you want to be!. ,StopGaming,cqbts0x,2,t5_2tjkc

Sometimes it is more simple than that. You dont need a rough childhood to become an alcoholic although Im sure there is a correlation. Sunce the other responses were so great Ill try and not repeat them.He wont quit until he both realizes he has an issue and wants to quit. You leaving might have given him the reality check he needs. It may not be enough though. All you can do is give him the facts. Yes gaming addiction is real. In fact all of his behaviors you described to include the depression and outburts. It may be his addiction talking but that doesnt excuse him or mean you have to bear that burden.The other thing...I was lucky. My wife stuck by me and barely complained. My own introspection made me realize I had a problem and a neglected spouse. What I wanted to say however is what she told be once I recovered. She told me that I was a better husband than I had ever been. She said it was like night and day.I tell you this because your SO has an affliction. It is part of who he is now but it might not always be. If he accepts help and starts recovery you might be amazed by the change.Im not telling you to wait on him. That is up to you.

Not as much as if I was playing online but it stops me losing myself in it and is fairly social.The great thing about GO is unlike chess it has an amazing handicap system so you can play with newer players i.e ones you teach and still have balanced games.

Playing video games again even one more time solidifies those neural circuits further and makes the process of reverting back to normal even longer and more difficult.Or you can exercise your brain in another direction. Puzzles sport television and movies music reading travel socializing etc. etc. Literally doing anything else besides gaming creates and ultimately sustains new neural connections. And at some point your brain literally wont be large enough to keep all the connections you need so the least used most atrophied connections will be pruned away.

If you havent read it yet I highly recommend The Power of Now. Its a little woowoo and spiritual but every time Im reading it it speaks to me and calms me down a lot. So whenever I get a craving to play or download or watch streams I pick it up and start reading. I only ever read it when Im craving and so far Im about  of the way through according to my kindle and now that Im nearing the end I havent really had a craving since my last relapse. Ive had all the free time in the world since Im on winter holiday but I havent even thought about playing League. Maybe that will help you a bit.

6586715,0,t3_443ok0,Hi Lagertha. My brother is pretty much in the same situation as yours. Only hes  years older than your brother and hes still doing the same thing.  years old this year and he never finished his degree could never hold down a job. He spends most of the day holed up in his room in the dark playing video games on an overpriced monitor paid for with my parents money. Yes my parents are enablers in the same way yours are. My parents give him an allowance which he blows on video games and cigarettes most days he forgets to shower brush his teeth or even change his clothes. Even at family meals hell be playing a game on his phone. When we go out to have meals with other families all my brother is able to talk about with other people are video games when everyone else at the table is talking about marriage about their work or about their kids. When it comes to chores its always delegated to me and my sister. My brother isnt expected to do a single thing for reasons I cant even begin to fathom. Because hes the only son? Because hes the oldest? Im not sure.  Please tell your parents this is the reality of what happens when you continue to enable your brother and his addiction. Its not pretty. Your brother wont wake up and suddenly want to stop on his own not when everything is being done for him and he has nothing to worry about. Please please please. Dont let what is happening to my brother happen to yours.,StopGaming,d00mbyj,1,t5_2tjkc

To answer your question method of quitting least likely to result in relapse... youre looking at it the wrong way to me it is mostly about what you fill your now massive amounts of free time with. If youre hooked on gaming you will have spent the last few years freeing up your schedule to game more and more. It is now about filling that time with things that are valuable enough to you to not feel a temptation to go back.So im gonna answer your question with questions...How many hours a week do you play games?What are you now going to fill that time with?How are you going to stop yourself giving into the craving when you have it?And how will you measure success? ,StopGaming,d0fnx6k,1,t5_2tjkc

As soon as you start playing basically but in real life it would take a considerably longer period of time. However the feeling of actually playing a song in real life to other people and getting praise for it is way better compared to sitting near a computer and makes you feel so much more alive etc. Games are all about getting the reward fast and without putting much effort for it. There are some rewards that take a lot of time in games too but youre constantly being rewarded on your way.Its not only games. Mindless redditingyoutubing etc. is also all about instant gratification.

10202401,0,t1_dc0gocj,At one point I was playing games so much that I forgot what time I was sleeping and waking up. I cannot believe that its been more than a year since I played my last game actively.I have tried many things to evade my gaming addiction. Here are the things that worked for me.. Clean environment  Having an environment that does not encourage my gaming urges. For example Having a gaming console in my room or having all games installed on my laptop. During my past I had an excuse that removing them is not a right direction for me to get rid of my addiction. But My most successful run without gaming has been by removing them from my immediate vicinity. I even sold my windows laptop and bought a Macintosh.. Healthier Habits  After removing all of my gaming consoles and gaming apps. I had so much free time that I was starting to get afraid that I will retract to my older habits. So I started writing down my long term goals and working towards them. One of the game changers was going to the gym and meeting others in social meetups. It not only gave me relief but also gave me selfconfidence. Playing team sports  gym gives you the practice of pushing yourself to your limit. This habit then can be related to your regular lives. Thats the reason many of the successful people encourage to exercise  going outdoors in some form. From my personal experience It is very important to keep your mind and body busy during the early stages. Try reading books meetup.com hiking pushups etc.. Switching communities  This might not apply to others but this was necessary for me. I had to move away from many of the people that did not support my life change. Keep in mind I do occassionally meet them for outdoor activities. But I rarely ever go to any of the social gatherings that revolve around gaming anymore. This is something that was necessary throughI am sure There are many more things that can be down to cure your gaming habits. But these were my major changes that I had to do.During my change One of the books that deeply affected my change was Models by Mark Manson. The book provides you guidance on what is necessary to do for a better life. I used that book to write down all of its assignments as my own personal checkpoints in my life. Give that book a shot and see if its to your liking.After reading so many comments in this subreddit. I feel like I know every single one of you to a certain extent.

10657092,0,t3_5sab5w,I used to be in a similar situation and in general I am bad at balancing between hobbies that take a lot of time and investment like coding and gaming. I just do one or the other its all or nothing.In high school I would play games for a couple months then get bored and start a new personal programming project or continue an old one and switch between the two every few months. I was spending a lot of time on the computer but still studying enough to keep good grades. In the last year I started playing online games mostly mmos quite seriously and my grades dropped. Luckily at the final exam I got good enough grades in the subjects needed to get into a software degree and then gaming almost messed up my degree too but thats another story.My advice to not let gaming suck away all your time and energy would be to avoid online games that are very competitive like mobas or require a huge time investment like mmos. These are the most addictive for me because you always want to progress. And you do little by little every time you play. But before you know it you spent a huge amount of time on them and missed a lot of things you could have done instead.To keep yourself focused on programming I would find an idea for a project that you care about for example a simple D game or a website to manage your team or something that helps you with another hobby. Its not easy but once you find a good one then it keeps you motivated to try new things learn more languagesframeworksdomains and slowly build your skills. Maybe its a similar to what keeps you hooked on playing some games except that it really is an investment that pays back once you earn a living doing what you like Another thing to remember is that while it sucks having to spend so much time studying for your testsexams at school while you would rather be having fun playing with your friends you will have time later to play these games. Its just that some times are more forgiving than others for spending a lot of time gaming.,StopGaming,ddf7465,2,t5_2tjkc

10739813,0,t3_5tncer,Take it from a guy in his s that managed to quit smoking cigarettes and is going on  months sober video gaming can be a real addiction.  It is the last one I havent quit yet.  The main reason for me is that the other ones were arguably worse and I needed something to get me through kicking those.  Now that they are done games are on the chopping block but hell it aint easy.  Finding something else to do with the free time is the hardest I think.  I already play an instrument and Im married so those two pursuits obviously dont cut it on their own.Youre on the right track though.  Recognizing a problem is certainly a great first step toward fixing it.  It took me two years to actually quit smoking and at least two more to finally quit drinking.  If I had never stopped to think maybe this is not good for me I probably would have remained on autopilot and still be hooked today.Cigarettes are a habitual thing even if they are not appealing any more.  Id finish a round in LD and jump up to run outside for a butt before joining the next game.  It took a serious selfawareness to even notice I was doing it.  Even after I quit I would occasionally find myself standing outside with no smokes wondering how I could get all the way there without noticing.Turn off the autopilot.  Pay attention to yourself when you power up your console.  Make a point of always turning your PC off rather than letting it sleep.  Make getting to the games more difficult for yourself so you have extra time to come to your senses and notice what you are doing.  This can give you time to back out and do something else.Most importantly dont beat yourself up over your failure to stop gaming and suddenly have a different life.  Recognize instead that by posting here you are loving yourself and trying to help yourself.  What would you do for a friend if they were the person that posted this thread?  Would you want to help them?  Step outside of yourself as much as you can and treat yourself like a separate person a friend in need of a hand.Good luck.,StopGaming,ddnqbbu,12,t5_2tjkc

11430066,0,t1_dfqcgjn,Wow never thought of it that way. It definitely helps to change your lifestyle around but it doesnt fall into place straight away.When I quit I felt really bad about ditching the team I was playing with. Dota was our common interest and without that there was nothing to talk about with them. Im not friends with any of them any more when I would have considered them very good friends at the time.Lifestyle changes definitely provide clarity.,StopGaming,dfrl3ns,1,t5_2tjkc

11597885,0,t1_dgahz62,Yes please do. Dont come back. Because as smart as you are you cant seem to understand the concept of what a addict is! An addict is NOT normal. What they do is against social norm. They mess up their lives because of this addiction because they CANT stop even if they want to. Now if all your comments are trying to make that point of why would they do that? Its not right. Well no shit Sherlock. Obviously. Do yourself a favor and look up some documentaries about addiction and educate yourself before you comment. Itll save you from looking like an idiot. ,StopGaming,dgamn8v,7,t5_2tjkc
11612799,0,t1_dgc18hr,When it comes to LoL what u find is that no matter how addicted to it you become unless you are pretty good at it or adamant to keep playing it. It will eventually just get stale. There is only so many ways you can do one thing and even though they add updates to help this. It only helps a little. Ive put at k hours in that game over about  years. Ive spent around p dollars on it. All worth it because I got a lot of fun out of it. If he does get addicted Im not saying this is a good thing or that to make him play more the more he plays the quicker hell get sick of it. At least this is my experience with it anyways. ,StopGaming,dgcbk0f,3,t5_2tjkc
11619062,0,t3_65s6k9,I played this game a lot in middle school during its prime. That was like  years ago maybe longer. I made an account on it yesterday since I found out you could play old school runescape. Played for about  minutes and was just bored out of my mind quickly. Idk what I saw in that game as a kid but I remembered it being amazing. The only reason I quit back then was because I got banned and didnt feel like starting from scratch on a new character. ,StopGaming,dgd1549,5,t5_2tjkc
11620616,0,t3_65n60h,Anything thats competitive and teambased is going to be stressful it gives players both a reason to care about losing and other parties to blame for it. I recommend just staying away from such things if you care about your own mental health I have a similar problem and I cant touch MOBAs or competitive FPSs as a result.I used to get so angry at certain games that my parents started pushing me to quit the medium as a whole. They havent stopped but Ive gotten a lot better at identifying and dropping problem games in which frustration outweighs fun. Again I recommend you do the same if a game usually leaves you feeling angry for hours on end just stop playing it. Its not doing its job. ,StopGaming,dgd7hiq,1,t5_2tjkc

11684755,0,t1_dgkdkso,I dunno theres an inherent asymmetry in this relationship in that if there was no gaming then there wouldnt be any need to stop being addicted to gaming. This sub is created as a support group for gamers in general a gamer with specific problems yes but a gamer first and foremost and a gamer feeling that their hobby is valid etc is an important question for all of us. If gamers could enjoy their hobby in a healthy way that would lessen the stigma associated with it. And for us when were asking the metaquestion of the problems inherent to gaming the burden is on us to respect the people who want to appreciate gaming on the first level. Making people feel bad because we see the problems in something but they dont is kind of like being an SJW.,StopGaming,dgkhg23,2,t5_2tjkc
