Nothing about the hits in the th last night were cheap or unlucky. gtDoes anybody know why we shifted the outfield the other way for Votto and Bruce?Its rare for any hitter to lift the ball pull side. The vast majority of flyballs are centeropposite field. Votto especially is willing to use the whole field. Bruce is a little different though as he pulls the ball more.VottoSo the thought is they can pull the ball and itll either be on the ground or a line drive we cant do anything about. So they position the OF opposite field. Just like when theres a huge shift on the infield and the OF shades the other way. ,CHICubs,cqcd9ih,1,t5_37k90

These are facts though we are one of the most inexperienced teams in the league and we have the Cardinals in our division. Not exactly a recipe for success.So while Im still going to watch every game that I can and continue to get hyped as fuck I think I might have to push the WS Trophy a bit further back in my metaphorical horizon. Not giving up hope on this team at all just accepting that while this is the best roster weve seen in what seems like forever its still got so much progress to make. These guys can and hopefully will lead us to a WS but this is not the year that we will have the best chances. So for now Im just going to sit back enjoy and watch this team become great.

I think other factors include the leadershippresence and being able to trade Castillo for other value once Montero was acquired. With Montero on board Castillos value was probably better allocated elsewhere rather than getting  starts max. In short Beef provided too much value to be a backup he value wouldnt have been maximized or optimally used. So you figure you sign Ross to be a very servicable backup and trade the excess value for other parts Medina as we now know. gthes been catching lester for a while.Yeah like  of his total starts.

4286653,0,t1_cs8qii4,the thing about everyone is doing it is that you cant really take this case and extrapolate it beyond just this case. A Cardinals former executive used the same passwords at his new job and allowed vengeful current Cardinals employees to hack his database. This all stems from the computer that leaked all those files last year.

Even though I will wholly admit Kershaw has probably been the best of the three the BBWAA will not give the award to the guy who is last of the three in ERA and wins because he has the best FIP and strikeouts. You cant argue with Greinke. The guy currently has the best singleseason ERA of the past  years and nd best WHIP. You cant argue with Arrieta who has three more wins and a better krate in more innings than Greinke while only having the fourthbest ERA in that time span. ,CHICubs,cvh0sfy,9,t5_37k90

5373100,0,t1_cvyf8bj,Because thats just how the game is called from the very youngest levels of the game. You dont want pitchers at    trying to crowd batters when theyre just learning how to control a fastball. So you take say half an inch to inch off the inside of the plate and add it to the outside. Thus pitchers learn that not every rule book strike is a strike. And batters learn this too. They even teach you it as a home plate ump. Thus at every level you have every part of an at bat basically being told that a rule book strike isnt always a strike. ,CHICubs,cvyh2q6,1,t5_37k90

Thats something I feel like most Mets and Cubs fans have in common.  Were born into this madness we call baseball.As a partial season ticket holder I have tickets to all the games at Citifield this postseason.  Ill be there tomorrow and Sunday cheering loudly for my boys but for tonight I wanted to come in here and congratulate you guys on a killer season.Like any other fan I believe my team can make it to the World Series and win.  If thats not possible Im immediately jumping on the Cubs bandwagon.  How can you not?  Talk about a Cinderella story.  Id be really surprised if Bryant doesnt win ROY and Arrieta doesnt win the Cy Young.  I can tell you I believe that either of our teams has the edge in the World Series over the American League teams.I cant hate on the Cubs.  I just cant.  You guys are Americas sweethearts!I really hope we have a great series filled with exciting baseball and free from scandal.If you told me back in April that we would be facing you guys in the NLCS I never would have believed you.

Oohhh catch I thought to myself.  That sounds fun.  And as a Right Fielder I think a few backandforth tosses with the ole ball coach will help keep my shoulder warmed up for that inevitable moment when I have to rifle arm some punk ass bitch rounding third.  Yeah Id like that.I glanced to my left.  No volunteers.  Peered to my right.  Still nothin.  So I raised my hand faster than a robbery victim hopped up on meth.  Coach smiled gave me an appreciative nod and then he...walked away.  ??? minutes later I was still sitting on the bench looping that bizarre conversation in my mind when the coach walked off the pitchers mound staring daggers through my tiny little soul.What the hell did I do? I wondered to myself.  Youre the one who reneged on your offer tograb the what?  What mask?  Oh.  Ohhhhhhh.

And I think its safe to say the  year old who is the best defensive RF in all of baseball will be better than someone on the wrong side of  who has a  UZR for his career. Ill trust that Theo knew Heyward could play CF when that was the original plan. I dont see why anyone thinks Szczur plays a damn good CF. He is an average defensive OF. I would say there is basically  chance that your optimal defensive OF of Dex in LF Szczur in CF Heyward in RF ever happens. There are plenty of people who can play corner OF and at least  who can play CF. I would think thats enough flexibility. If you have Szczur as one of the  bench spots when Baez comes back then your bench consists of Soler Baez Ross and Szczur. I doubt Joe would be ok with half his bench having dead bats.,CHICubs,d1ibspn,1,t5_37k90

Cubs are something like  in their last  or so and still up  in the division. Sure I want Ws like everyone else but baseball season is the definition of a marathon not a sprint.

In most cases male birds sport brighter bolder colors as a way to attract mates during the breeding season. Female birds are usually duller with less distinctive markings that make it easier for them to blend in to the surroundings while they mind a nest or protect young birds.Female Cardinals fit into this category therefore making Fredbirds mother the bright red one in the dress a male of the species and the father the darker colored grey one a female.,CHICubs,d4h47aq,6,t5_37k90

Why set a goal that you cant control your success?  wins last year and we were rd in our division. rd best team in baseball and one of the last admitted to the postseason. Other teams can win against other teams and end the season with more wins than us even if we swept them. It doesnt make sense to set a goal you cant ensure you achieve. We can however win our division we have a lot more control with that goal. Winning our division ensures October baseball. And honestly the whole goal is to play baseball in October and win the final game of the year.

For the lb burger challenge I went to the restaurant with my two brothersinlaw all of us very capable of putting away a ton of food. My one brother in law had completed the challenge years ago and kept bragging saying how I wasnt going to be able to beat him. Long story short I ate the burger in like  and he didnt even finish. I could tell he was pissed but I still gave him shit because theres nothing wrong with a little friendly jabbing. Ever since that day he hasnt talked to me the same.

Anyway in re that Russell thread I responded to your comment saying that Russell deserves his number back which was clearly a shot at Heyward given the fact that Heyward wears Addis old number btw its a number that Addi gave up willingly he wasnt forced to give it up and that youve spent literally months on this subreddit taking boring unprompted and repetitive potshots at Heyward. Defending a player that I genuinely like probably qualifies as obsessive too but to a lesser extent than your obsession. By the way Heyward wears  to honor his high school best friendteammate who died. Implying that he doesnt deserve to wear that number is a bit tone deaf though I shouldnt expect anything approaching decency from someone who spent an entire game thread saying how much he wants to have sex with an ABC reporter.,CHICubs,d6gsiqv,12,t5_37k90

8668561,0,t1_d6p637g,I agree.  Im not saying Torres for JoFer was going to happen. But obviously Torres had a pretty substantial value.  Going into the next few years we will need another young near the top of the rotation starter.  Torres gets that conversation started.  Chapman is great regardless of tonight.  The problem is any reliever only helps for one inning and no reliever is guaranteed.  Its a sample size thing.  Beyond that this Cubs team is very good but cold streaks happen.  Going strong this year but hurting the years to come is not how championships come to be.  Everyone likes to talk about the Giants even year magic but the reality is they werent even the best team on paper any of those years. The playoffs are weird and the goal is always making them.  We were already going to make them. The Chapman trade hurt making the playoffs going forward.,CHICubs,d6p6v2c,1,t5_37k90

9304668,0,t1_d8v8udb,Our run average is exaggerated by a bit of luck. We got three runs from pitchers in game  who hit . and and . on the year. Decent for pitchers but you cant count on that. We got another five off a fluke grand slam that even if you think Miggy is picking up was flukey in just that scenario of Roberts trying to get Chapman out of the game put that many men on base the Fowler HR for the fifth was almost certainly the result of a broken pitcher hanging one once mentally shook. So of the twentyfive post season runs weve scored eight were pretty lucky. Not counting them were averaging . runs per game. Thats probably not enough to win seven more games this year considering its less than the lowest scoring team in baseball averaged this season Philly .. If you count Jakes three run shot off MadBum as flukey our flukeless average is less than three. Jake hitting isnt flukey but hes not in the nine spot every day either. Also while it was a heads up play you could reasonably argue Javys stolen home was a bit lucky as well.Five games isnt a huge sample size so Im not in panic mode but bats need to heat up and generate some more traditional runs if were gonna go all the way.   ,CHICubs,d8vfmq2,1,t5_37k90

9541898,0,t3_5bk2j4,My thoughts Fowler will be gone and Almora should start in CF. Hes a  WAR upgrade defensively and hes underrated as a hitter due to a bad couple of months he had in  in the minors dropping his hype value. Note he followed that up with a game or so onbase streak. Outside of that hes been solid and is always improving. In the majors this year he showed that with consistency and atbats he can be a solid  or  in the lineup next year with an OPS in the  range despite not walking much. His coverage also takes some pressure off of Schwarbers defense in LF.Heyward will improve back to his average on offense. Thats substantial enough for a few extra wins.I think well go hard after Chapman and I can see us signing him. If so I think Rondon is traded as he really doesnt fit anywhere that we cant already fit Grimm Strop and Edwards and Rondon has the highest trade value due to being a true closer.I think Arrieta is gone after next year. Just a gut feeling huge money in a year everyone is saving up for. That leaves us with Lester Hendricks and Montgomery in  and probably Dylan Cease. We need to at least partially prepare for that now.So I think well go after another starting pitcher and that Montgomery is more suited for a  again in  longrelief with a spot in the rotation if theres an injury and then as a solid  starting in . Gone Wood solid resume teams will offer him more than were willing to pay Cahill SmithSo if I had to place a bet Id say Chapman resigns and we will package Soler  Rondon  maybe Happ for a  level pitcher with  years of control.Leadoff batter is Javy. He has the potential to be a  SB guy and putting him in that spot with an adjustment in his plate approach along with less pressure to knock it out of the park could turn him into a paragon.,CHICubs,d9p8jkc,1,t5_37k90

I just dont see how this signing changes much for him given that Jay doesnt usurp Soler in any role. Maybe it gives Szczur a marginally better chance of being a platoon partner for someone in the corners?

Profar is a former top  prospect but has had multiple injuries. Gallo is trueoutcomes player and may never hit his ceiling based on K. Mazara seemed to play pretty well. Andrus never truly became an allstar and he just had a career year all things considered ... vs Career ... Delta is pts on the traditional slash line. ShinSoo Choo and CarGo are Xfactors  if Choo and CarGo can restore their former glory then this offense will GO. If not  more averageish players near or over .Overall the Rangers are barely treading water defensively   in  with a DRS of .X. So we cant really say that hes playing behind a stellar defense that will prop his numbers up.The move just seems strange. Maybe it was  driven. Maybe hell get more playing time with the Rangers. Maybe he cant hit the little white ball and wanted to play in a league with a DH doesnt make sense for his fiscal future AL ERA is on average .. runs higher than NL gtgt. Just seems that from a comparative perspective the Cubs have routinely chased him for  years have a good defense and offense as well as a slot for him next year to start when Lackey andor Arrieta leave.

Maddon confirmed this today saying Zobrist will be the B most the time.

In  I moved to Chicago and I said screw it Ive never had a better reason to root for a team than living near their stadium! So I became a Cubs fan.
