3186038,0,t1_cos869e,Look are you interested in help or not? All I want to do is suggest things that might help you feel better about your own life since you seem to be in a tough spot at the moment. A routine of cardio stretching and weightlifting with proper form  coupled with a proper diet will regulate your hormones and neurotransmitters. Over time Itll alter your biologyneurochemistry to a point where you cant help but feel better about your own life.I dont mean to criticize or judge. You can take my offering or leave it.,isfj,cos8ead,2,t5_2r39e
3525586,0,t3_30gsow,My boyfriends the ISFJ. Im an ENSFP  Strengthwise its probably that Im good at coaxing him out of his shell in a gentle nonaggressive way. I bring him out without being pushy. Also as one of the more introverted types of extroverts I appreciate his need for alone time. We balance each other well!Negatives? Sometimes I need too much attention. p Also I love to socialize which is sometimes too much for him. Also also I dont always openly express my feelings so it can be hard to tell if Im genuinely happy.,isfj,cpu545n,4,t5_2r39e
3863889,0,t1_cqwob94,Thank you very much for your insights! Ive been reading up on N vs. S functions lately and it is really interesting how hard it is to conceptualize the differences between them. As of yet I have not found a universally understoodagreed upon hypothetical situation which illustrates how the approaches differ. This makes me think you are correct that the difference must often be transcended rather than understood. I think that for turbulent ISFJs like myself our attention to detail coupled with F may lead us to become personally offended about a lot of little things which are just other types blowing off steam or stereotyping for convenience of analysis. I accept and thank you for your advice that I should stop taking people on the internet so seriously an easier pill to swallow after your sweet compliments of the ISFJ comunity! You guys are equally fascinating and can often be pretty swell too  ,isfj,cqwpux7,1,t5_2r39e
3895193,0,t3_3508pb,Ive been dating an ENFP for almost  years now. Instead of feeling like our personalities clash its strangely complimentary. ,isfj,cr0ab7t,3,t5_2r39e
4020500,0,t3_36iunt,I think its in our nature as ISFJs to have lofty goals for ourselves and feel disappointed and ashamed if we fall short.  One thing Ive been practicing is allowing myself to treat slipups as learning experiences on the journey toward the ultimate goal rather than as failures.  When you widen the timeline for a goal you give yourself more chances to succeed  and ultimately to reevaluate what constitutes success.  I have a broader definition for the word than I used to.,isfj,crekfz1,2,t5_2r39e
4352238,0,t3_3au3dg,You might look into any resources your college provides as far as career exploration options. Mine offers a combo MBTI and Strong interest inventory test that helped inspire me to try to figure out what I want to do. Im also going to be a college senior this year but it is yet to be seen if I know what Im doing or not haha.,isfj,csg8a8p,1,t5_2r39e

5482877,0,t3_3q1rc7,I made rules for myself. Sick? Dont work out. Emotionally drained? Work with less effort. Mentally drained? Reduce personal responsibility of emotionally intense situations. If two of the three things I listed are an issue absolutely no skipping on sleep under any circumstances. Before the rules Id stretch myself too thin and break down.,isfj,cwchljj,1,t5_2r39e
7386180,0,t1_d2hjmdy,its a username i made when i was  and never stopped using it. its the name I gave the main character in the game final fantasy  because he swims a lot and it looks like he waxes his chest. dont care much for the game but ive been using the username for so long that its sentimental now.,isfj,d2hraul,2,t5_2r39e
7827506,0,t1_d3u7zqn,I should mention that this distraction came at the worst time. I was extremely devout  almost fundamentalist in my convictions. However Ive recently been reading through some literature and listening to some lectures on the controversies of Christianity. As a result Ive been experiencing rather intense existential insecurity.Your words come at a good time. It is interesting that you say that. Releasing dogma and habit have been devastating me inside. However I know that it is the inevitable byproduct of truth. Heres to hoping that the truth will expand in me.,isfj,d3vvmnf,1,t5_2r39e
8021401,0,t1_d4hjsqg,I happen to feel the same way. But before you base your understanding of self on the appearance of other INFJs remember this NO type is better than another. People may like certain types better but there is no reliable metric of the goodness or uniqueness of one type. The INFJs who post here arent entirely representative of all INFJs. There are many different filters and the sample size is too small. Many of us are in their youth teens to thirties but there are many who hail from their elder years and the distribution may not accurately represent the average INFJ if it exists.Also take into consideration the echo chamber that is Reddit the vocal minority may seem like an aligned majority when the rest are scattered. INFJs are notoriously hard to nail down. It can be hard to find someone you can relate to and even then they are a completely separate human being who will never understand your complex personality values and tendencies.I only hope that people can continue to try to understand themselves better. You may call into question your perception of self but it is essential if you wish to improve and learn. Please dont resign yourself to a type of you are not entirely sure I for one am still deciding!!,isfj,d4hoiyt,2,t5_2r39e
9390414,0,t3_54nwhq,I.T. is pretty great because its about  doing stuff at my desk and  walking around fixing things. Not too much people contact but enough to not get sad about being in the office all day. ,isfj,d96avcp,1,t5_2r39e
