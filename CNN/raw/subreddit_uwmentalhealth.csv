2249075,0,t1_ckru7oo,In my opinion I feel like that is a failure on the profs part not the AccessAbility office.While getting a paper signed may seem old school I think it is good to connect with your profs  if you need an accommodation the prof should be a resource you should feel comfortable discussing this with. The profs should be seen as another tool to go to for support. imo anyway,uwmentalhealth,clpphx6,1,t5_332ul
