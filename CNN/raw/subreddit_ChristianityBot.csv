Its always been something I was selfconscious of. Its not to the point where I cant be myself and still be happy or anything like that. I think it would make me feel more feminine and sexy. I do want to have breast implants. I should also say that I have a fiance who is the one I desire to feel sexy for specifically more so after we are married. He wants me to do whatever will make me comfortable and give me confidence in that part of my body. I also want to be able to give him that as a woman. Dont get me wrong though he isnt solely the reason why I want them. He wouldnt mind either way.gt The thing I have been struggling with is that I dont know if its wrong in Gods eyes. I know he made us perfectly with no mistakes but Im not sure if that type of surgery is just sinful and if this is something I should just forget about. I have been researching the topic but havent brought myself to take steps beyond that because I dont want to take a step in a direction God wouldnt be pleased with.

I mean it seems like a lot of the internet atheist types are very young not all obviously. Many of them are really just discovering a world outside their religious backgrounds for the first time. When that happens at least when it happened for me people tend toward a complete negation of what they once thought was true. That inevitably ends up in a lot of ridicule and mockery.gt gt As for more moderate atheism groups I think you dont find them because atheism just isnt that interesting. Christians Jews Muslims or any other flavor of religious group they all have something in common to talk about. The only thing atheists have is we all dont believe in those other things.

Its been a long two years but hell finally be home. Im more happy for my mother. Its been hard seeing how much its hurt her that he was in prison. This was her second son that was locked up. My oldest brother did close to  years and got out on . My brother that is coming home got locked up in  and is coming out now in time for Christmas! He had Gods favor and guiding hand during his hearings. He was looking at  years with the DA refusing any bargains and she kept rescheduling the date. But we declared favor and victory and we prayed wholeheartedly and after the third reschedule the DA decided to give him just two years. He was locked up in a maximum security prison that was  hours away and we continued to pray and out of nowhere he gets asked to join the fire crew. They sent him to San Diego even closer!  hours away and he spent the better part of a year there. That camp was awesome. All of the guys there were on good behavior and they only hold them for a year and then theyre released. If they mess up then its back to maximum security. So they all made sure they all got along. He loved it. He worked with the local fire department and finally got in shape. He used to be an overweight guy and now hes muscular. To sum up what a fire camp looks like think the bookmovie Holes but where the whole place actually cares about the inmates.

There are plenty of subtle intellectual fallacies which Christian thinkers have perfected over the years from blunt instruments like the ontological proof to more subtle sophistries like the first mover argument.

Obviously by my tag Im a nonbeliever. Want to give a bit of background on my history in hopes it will better help a recommendation for a book.  Raised Roman Catholic confirmed at  years old. I didnt really believe back then but was more forced to do it then anything else. gt gt Early s I decided I wanted to find God and read much of the bible OT and NT. The bible seemed to not make any sense to me and the Catholic Church seemed so corrupt and out of touch with reality led me to look in other religions. Wicca Buddist Taoist Islam and Jainism are a few whom I read there holy books and looked into. gt gt I chose wicca cause I liked the reincarnation ideas and its more environmental focus.  Ended up ditching that after a year or so and started to look for a deeper god.  Was a Pantheist for a few years before eventually realizing I wanted to know what evidence existed for a god.  Ive been an atheist for  years or so and have continued to educate myself on the bible and its history.  gt gt So now we get to my question what is the best apologetic book for a skeptic free thinking atheist you can recommend? I heavily suggest not putting forward anything denying science or evolution.   I genuinely would like to know and I do plan on picking at least one to read as honestly as I can.  edited for grammar,ChristianityBot,cnwi9og,1,t5_2xbgs
