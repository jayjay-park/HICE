33313,0,t3_1uhrcy,My story is only truly enjoyable if you are a fan of the TV show Futurama...but its still one of my favorite stories to tell so lets do this.Its either  or  and Im flying to see my high school girlfriend who is doing an externship in Charleston SC. My flight has one layover in Atlanta but I dont leave NY until about  minutes after the intended take off. Get to Atlanta only have a carryon and run to my connecting flight. I miss the flight by minutes. Delta puts me up in a local hotel and will fly me to Myrtle Beach on the red eye. Get to the hotel Im starving. Ask the concierge where the closes  is and they dont know what Im talking about. They direct me to a waffle house close by. I leave the hotel walk about  minutes to a main road where I see a closed down McDonalds and a Waffle House sign behind it. Walk down the main road and between the McDs and the Waffle House is a night club. As I walk past the night club  cars go flying out of the parking lot and down the street. Seconds later multiple cop cars come flying up the road into the same parking lot.I walk inside the waffle house where the waitress asks me whats going on. I explain Im from Jersey I have no clue whats going on but Im starving. Shes sweet jokes around with me and i get some delicious food to eat.I leave the waffle house and walk past the night club where now there are a lot of cop cars and a lot of people being interviewed. As Im walking past I see one random dude catch eyes with me while being interviewed and he points at me and yells that I was there. I start to panic and call my buddy Bill. He picks up and I tell him whats going on and that I need someone to talk to so no one stops me. I get past the night club walk to the hotel and to my room with no problems but I was still kind of shook. I thank Bill for talking me through it and hang up.I get to my hotel room and my phone starts blowing up with messages from Bill telling me to turn on cartoon network. I oblige and see that tonights episode of Futurama is none other than The Lost City of Atlanta. I watched laughed my ass off and went to sleep. Obviously nothing bad happened but I can never watch that episode the same way again. ,cigars,cei82v8,2,t5_2r090

54468,0,t3_1uq78n,Profiling is a bitch. When Ive visited BampMs in farflung cities Ive learned its not uncommon to be escorted to ensure that no cigars are stolen. This is especially true in shops that dont have security cameras.  It helps to be a regular at one or two local shops. It helps to dress older or more professional instead of casually. I frequently stop at my favorite brick and mortar on my way home from work dressed in suit and tie. The first time hung out at that BampM lounge dressed in shorts and tshirt the owners ragged me for underdressing.  Shoot the shit with the owners and staff. Let them know that youre knowledgeable about cigars. There is a local wine and cigar shop that has WAY overpriced cigars. Im very confident that I know more about their cigars than the poor girl thats on staff there to mostly sell wine. They are one of the shops where the staff hovers to make sure that customers dont steal cigars. It sucks but Ive come to expect that thats just how that shop does business.,cigars,cekmqaa,3,t5_2r090

I can kinda understand the delay on Wednesday but subzero temps are NORMAL for winter here and the weather has been good for  days.  This is not a big town and im betting they had higher daily volumes during the holidays than this little backlog created.

102751,0,t1_ceq35zz,The Deep Dish is going to be similar to the Blondie.  Sweet and if you arent a fan of the Blondie you probably wouldnt enjoy the other blue label offerings such as deep dish and Kuba Kuba.  The cold infusion tea was one that took me a couple times to enjoy.  It has a smoked black tea flavor to it imagine that right?  Very light though and not heavily aromatic.  Might be a good selection to try.  Another one to try would be the Acid One.  It is nonaromatic as well and we have gotten strong toasted marshmallow flavor from it every time and proves to be enjoyable.  Personally I didnt enjoy the Nefasto as much as I would have liked to.  Didnt get any infusion from it.  I liked the Atom for its maduro wrapper and smooth finish.  It has been a long time since I smoked it so I forget exactly what I was picking up.  I did not enjoy the toast liquid and extraordinary larry at all.  I actually pick up bitter notes in the toast.  Similar to burnt food when it gets bitter.  The liquid and larry were just bland to me.  Those are going to be the easy to find stuff for the most part.  Have smoked a windy city and have some new shortys but those are not the easiest to find.  Shameless plug time our website tappedthatash.com has numerous different Acid reviews some in video format and some in written format.  Might think to check those out if you care enough to.  If not lots of people seem to review Acids and Im sure you can find a good review to get you the basics.  Hope this post didnt ramble too much.  tldl lots of Acids to choose from.  Maybe try an Acid One next.   AB,cigars,ceq4o6h,2,t5_2r090

108647,0,t1_ceqsq35,I completely agree with the ventilation system!  Even smokers dont like tons of smoke in a room.  When we built our lounge we added a system that pumps all of the air out of the room and up  stories and out the roof.  It changes the air in the room  every  minutes.  I do also agree that loyal customers will return for purchases.  But through my time with the store I see even the loyal customers spending less and less.  Though they are still coming in they arent buying boxes or restocking their humidors anymore.  Its only a cigar to smoke in the lounge and rarely anything more.  Its just a little unnerving to me.,cigars,ceqsv78,2,t5_2r090

111736,0,t1_cequh4w,I do but I havent found one I really like yet there is one in seattle that isnt too bad... my problem is budget.  Every BampM Ive been to the cigars worth smoking are all usually  each with a few smokes in the  range.  I like to smoke a couplefew cigars a week but I cant afford to do that if I wasnt getting smokes on cigarbid for usually under .  The last few hauls I got I didnt bid more than  on anything with a couple of rare exceptions and I got some decent well decent for me smokes.  If you take into consideration this time last year I was buying  packs of Swisher Sweets for about  at gas stations and now Im smoking Black Pearls and Gurkhas for slightly less than what I was paying for the swishers... I think Im moving up in the world.  I got enough sticks here that should be wellseasoned in the humis and last me until the end of this year and hopefully by then Ill be making more money and can smoke Undercrowns and Behikes every night,cigars,cer5jtk,1,t5_2r090

I prefer the latter personally but they are all great.  These things are true beauties.  Chocolatey smoothness everywhere and they mellow very well with age.  GoFs are all made by Fuente and I put them on the same level as Opus.  Oh and theres a  year anniversary version that came out last year I believe.

I would also have great coffee espresso and cappuccino  I would like to go have a couple cups of good coffee and smoke a nice cigar from time to time.  Atmosphere?  Personally I would go total old school cigar shop.  Big old cigar indian out front old memorabilia such as signs hanging up separate section for the lounge area and retail sales of cigars lighters cutters and humidors.  Lockers would be cool to have.  I would make them to look like old style refrigerators.  Big screen TVs in the lounge area with several seating options  at the bar big tables poker tables smaller tables  leather chairs everywhere.

297168,0,t1_cfbb2w6,Oh internet you take all kinds Im not really sure where to begin here... So i guess Ill just start from the beginning...I assure you my friend I am not confused Its not an assumption that its difficult to get Cubans in America it is for various reasons Ill discuss later.Really? Cigarbid is by no means an accurate estimate of how much a cigar should cost have you seen how much they pay for any ligas? People are stupid! And if youre going to pretend to use my original example at least use the correct cigar. I did not say lost city. I said Opus X which I can walk down to my locan BampM in NY and pick up one for . Also I never made any mention of the cost of cigars in my original comment but if youd like to argue those semantics we can do that as well.Like I said a single opus X is  so  of em will set me back A  pack of Cuban Cohiba Siglo IV is..... Now you tell me which costs more? A  pack of Padron  Corona is Or this site has a  pack for  Once again you tell me which one gives you more cigars for your money? But lets take things a step further lets compare Cohibas TOP cigar to Padrons TOP cigar.The Behike BHK The Padron  th anniversary  And lets go ahead and bring back your Opus X Lost city for this example. Any size about . Except the shark is .Once again both the Dominican and Nicaraguan are.... CHEAPER than the Cuban. Not only that but Ive also heard a lot of people express their opinions on the BHK and it wasnt very good. The Opus X and Padron however... I cant remember the last time I heard a poor review about them...Moving on to your bullet points... Cubans are hard to get  I didnt say impossible but I did say that Dominican Nicaraguan and Honduran cigars are easier to get your hands on as an American. Im curious how you could possibly disagree with that? If you walk into ANY BampM in the nation what are you going to see? Cubans? pretty unlikely. Nicaraguan? Yup! Dominican? Yup! how about Honduran? Yup! And why is that?? oh yesbecause its illegal let me say that slower so those of you with a simpler mind can take it all in IlLegal! And like all things illegal there a certain je ne sais quoi that comes with partaking in the enjoyment of said illegal product.So back to my original point.. Are Cuban cigars HARDER TO GET than Nicaraguan Dominican or Honduran cigars? uh yes!  Cubans are overrated  fortunately you agreed with me on this point so youve at least saved my yours and anyone who decides to read this some valuable time that they otherwise would have wasted reading another paragraph and would not have been able to get back.  One last thing Ive never had trouble locating a Padron Anniversary. My shop always has em and theyre always online. My shop doesnt carry Cubans though. So tell me how are the Padrons harder to find than the Cuban cigars?EDIT Cuban cigar sites removed,cigars,cfbkfmo,1,t5_2r090

Because I gum my cigars like a baby munching on a pacifier when the flavor runs out I get hit with the tobacco. I have it in my mind that the flavoring covers for lesser quality Im sure its in my mind and the enjoyment is simply not there. I will say that I immensely enjoy the Java from Drew Estate... Perfect amount of flavor...much more subtle. I also think it may have to do with the gaugetime it takes to smoke. Lesser caliber and length  quicker time  more enjoyable.I will say I dont really get how people can be negative or even critical about what people like. Just like food cars women or men if thats your preference etc. If you enjoy it just remember that haters gonna hate. Except Gurkha...

616712,0,t3_217c0d,I just finished seasoning a pretty big humidor. I fit in as many damp sponges as was possible inside with air flow around them. More surface area means more evaporation.Only use brand new sponges that dont come with soap in them thoroughly rinsed first and then dampened but not dripping with distilled water. I cut open a Ziploc bag to place beneath the sponges so the water wouldnt directly contact the wood.After two days the humidity read  on my digital hygrometer. It let it sit another day with a bunch of  Boveda packs inside and it held so it was time to add cigars. The whole process took  or . days. I will have had the humidor a week tomorrow and its sitting right at  and seems pretty stable even with all the opening to pick out cigars to smoke. Once these Bovedas are done and wont recharge anymore I may try something else but for now it seems pretty good.,cigars,cgaddmo,2,t5_2r090

821863,0,t3_23ju7l,I dont know much about this brand but I bought two boxes around  and this was my last one.  So another dozen year old cigar meets the flame and you get to read about it.  I really wish I knew more about the blend because these were always good cigars over the years.Anyways this is a proper Churchill cigar  long with a  ring the Julieta  vitola.  The wrapper was a solid dark maduro with a texture like suede leather.  I took it for a stroll with the dog and puffed away.  The prelight flavour was good.  Sweet maduro wrapped and a spicy cedar and tobacco flavour.  The draw was a bit tight though.  Probably over filled as after  years in a humidor it cant be too wet.  I lit it up and was disappointed.  There was next to no smoke! I had to double check it was lit and pulled hard but barely got any smoke.The smoke I did get was tasty though.  Thin but flavours were present.  The sweetness of the maduro was met with flavours of molasses and clover.  However the smoke was so thin in texture that I barely tasted it.  The cigar burnt crooked too.  It ashed itself after an inch revealing a cone of a cherry.  Obviously the blend of tobacco was uneven or it would have burnt better.  After the first ashing it improved significantly.  Flavours stayed the same but smoke volume and thickness increased.  The photo I took was after the second ashing and the cigar really took off.  It was great.  A Scotsman walking the river mentioned to me how good it smelled.  Flavours were not complex but favourable.  Honey Rose and the sweet molasses flavours.  The smoke got thicker and thicker ad it went down.  Smoked it to the last inch.  Not a bad cigar but the thin smoke really drew away from the experience early on.  If the first two thirds of the cigar was like the last third then it would have been excellent.  That just wasnt the case today.  ,cigars,cgxp4n2,1,t5_2r090

846605,0,t3_23trpb,This is gonna be more of a love song to a cigar rather than a review. To say I adore this cigar is an understatement. It has all of the qualities that I enjoy in a cigar. Its beautifully constructed the band is exceptional and then there is how it smokes. I like strong strength cigars and this one has more than enough kick to make one feel slightly euphoric when walking away from it nearly two hours after lighting it. This one is the double Robusto and I took my time with it. The flavors start off spicy with white pepper on the tongue that blends in and out with woodsy tones of light cedar and then more full like that of red oak. I also get a hint of dried apricots here and there. There is also the rich Congac flavor that is ever present but not overpowering. Its complex and flavorful but all the while just as smooth as a babys ass. For such a strong cigar to also be like silk in your mouth its an achievement as far as Im concerned. The cigar doesnt bleed smoke when at rest but take a pull on it and be sure to blow away from your face or you will be sitting in a cloud of smoke for the next ten seconds. The ash is a silver almost white with only an occasional fleck of black here or there. I was  minutes in before it let loose its grip of the cigar and fell promptly on my lap. I was pushing to see how far it went and Id happily do it again. The Opus cigars were like royalty in my book when I first began smoking and as Ive tried more of them not all are as good as their price tag would suggest. At close to  the Lost City is an investment one that I waited over six months to cash in but well worth it when the time is right. ,cigars,ch0ihf0,1,t5_2r090

A clip of the capped torpedo end reveals a smooth open draw. The cigar has a spice element accompanied by flavors of hay and maybe a little chocolate. The ash is weak bordering on flaky and doesnt hang in for long. I had these regularly a year ago but since Ive moved on and come back to it its not the cigar I remember.

PreLight Ive never made any bones about this but the th is one of my favorites. I prefer to use a VCut on the th. I find the punch to be too restrictive and a straight cut for the shorter vitolas allows too much air to pass through. Like the smell of the wrapper the air passes through the cigar and carries wheathay pepper and a bit of sweetness.Overall impression When I drink wine I like a fuller flavored dry peppery red wine. On occassion I will try a white wine and that is the analogy I like to use with the th. I like a full flavored cigar that is made of pepper and pain. The th is not that cigar. It is an elegant cigar that is consistently smooth creamy buttery and oaky with an essence of wheat  light pepper and a faint sweetness like honey. I find the flavors in the th to be mellow and lingering like a Chardonnay. The th is among my favorite cigars but  like a Chardonnay it is not a cigar I smoke all the time. But when I do I always enjoy it. The construction of the th is impeccable. While I do prefer the Toro the Robusto is an excellent substitute. I have found that the th can build up a lot of tar in the last third leading to a less than amicable finish which is why I prefer the Toro. The extra inch acts as an excellent filter for the cigar. I always marvel at how cool and slow the th burns. Its one of the few cigars that I have smoked that I consistently underestimate the smoking time. I typically torch a Robusto in an hourhour . This one always takes a bit longer. The ths flavors can be subtle subsumed its not a blunt instrument like a lot of the fuller flavored cigars are. I prefer to smoke this cigar in the morning breakfast  brunch Brunch...with Mimosas or when I have absolutely nothing to do but focus on the cigar. Floating in the pool  watching satellites pass by is also a great time to smoke the th. I find a lot of smokers take a pass on the th because it can be a subtle cigar and that is a shame. The th is a great cigar with a great flavor profile. Sure its a Mild cigar but that is a bonus.I can smoke a th around anyone at any time. The subtle pepperwheathoney flavors make up the room notes and are very pleasant. Every one of my friends who has expressed interest in cigars I have started them with the th or  when out of supply  another NicConn Shade cigar and have swayed them to the light side of the force.  F U  Communist Swine The th is a great cigar. Solid construction. Beautiful wrapper and color. And the band is awesome too. If youre new to cigars the th is a good starter. If you like to smoke a lot of cigars without the chainsmoking cigar smoker smell the th is a great way to go. If you are a hard core full flavored smoker and you are looking for a little balance an appetizer or a nice breakfast cigar the th is a good way to go. Hell if you like cigars Drink a glass of water cleanse your palate  and smoke a th. As a bonus they are cheap enough to smoke all day every day.  maintain an entire humidor of just Perdomo Cigars.

893467,0,t3_24crja,The COTD for the USA side is My Father No . I chose No.  the lancero.The smell is a bit woody peppery and like dank flowers.Firsttheres a light pepper cedary sweetness and a zing of spice on the tip of the tongue. Theres a bit of a herbaceous flavor to it in certain puffs that is interesting. Second the pepper taste comes to the front but isnt spicy just the flavor if that makes sense comes to the forefront and a bit of chaulky milky fruit sweetness that reminds me of nougats.Draw is good and surprisingly good burn for a lancero. I havent had the best luck with them in the past not going out if Im not puffing furiously.Im not feeling well and I think I might throw up and I still smoked tonight because I made the commitment to do it... and sat here and realized why the fuck am I doing this? I had to go just lay down. Why did I make myself have a second job smoking and writing this whole month? I kept pushing....and just am swallowed in discouragement by the overall tides today to not push further. I barely get feedback on reviews anyways. I put the cigar the fuck down. I had to get it off my chest. I ran out of civility and fucks to give. Im a positive person and even I hit a wall. Ill try again tomorrow morning to muster the last of what I got to finish the last two reviews.  current submitted reviews and  partially written for the end of the game and  more cigar COTD left to smoke.Overall sometimes cigars dont cure what ails when what ails you is cigar related. However what I did taste was tasty and it was the best burning lancero Ive had so I will be smoking another one in the future soon when I have a clear mind. I definitely havent had a bad My Father yet.,cigars,ch5uaon,2,t5_2r090

925944,0,t1_ch9iuix,I have experienced a few cigars here and there that were cherry picked recommendations from BampMs here in Athens GA and several with friends. I like to try to educate myself and be somewhat knowledgeable about things before I speak of them and so I did with cigars. I have been lurking here for awhile and scouring the internet learning everything I can about cigars. My palate is still new and unaccustomed to the nuances and slight hints of insert flavor here but in every cigar I taste a spiciness and something that makes me want to continue to try other cigars. I suppose I was attracted to cigars because it was something that seemed to me a more refined hobby. I dont mean to say that people who smoke cigars are prudes by any means more so that when I see someone smoking a cigar or someone who is knowledgeable about cigars I look upon them as someone who knows about the finer things in life with a sort of reverence. It is this that I hope to get out of smoking cigars the satisfaction of being able to define slight characteristics of a cigar. I get a joy out of it. Does that make any sense?  ,cigars,ch9j9jo,2,t5_2r090

1086008,0,t3_26jyh6,I was going to do a review comparison between an Arturo Fuente Anejo and the Liga Privada No.  to provide a contrast between what was the king cigar manufacture during the s craze when I first smoked cigars and what is now one of the new generation of blenders with no cuban roots that Im still learning about.  Well the No.  was plugged and unsmokable so I decided to smoke what I assumed would be the strongest cigar Ive got in order to crush my bitterness in a nicotine buzz and instead found a great cigar in its own right.Review Cain F LanceroThe Cain F is under the studio tobac company which was spun off from Oliva.  The Cain F is another creation of former Oliva master blender Sam Leccia.  Most of the Cain cigars have a blend consisting of  Ligero.  Ligero is the upper most leaves of the tobacco plant making it the most potent due to increased sun exposure.   The Cain F series has its  ligero distribution as  esteli ligero  condega ligero and  jalapa ligero.  These different ligeros reflect were the leaves were grown in Nicaragua with the esteli being the strongest due to increased sun exposure and the jalapa being the mildest of the three Nicaraguan ligeros as its grown in a shaded valley.  The distribution being heavy esteli ligero makes the Cain F the most potent in strength of all the Cain series cigars.Storage  Wineador for  days at  RH.  Dry boxed for  hours at  RH at room temp.PrelightThe Cain F lancero has a rustic looking habano wrapper with some noticeable veins.  I like this rustic appearance in a lancero and the band on the foot helps to show off this look.  The pack has a bit of give with no mushiness.  First ThirdOn the first draw its rich tobacco and black pepper.  Finish is a spicy red pepper.  About the inch mark the black pepper has faded.  Im getting a rich cedar and still a pleasant spicy red pepper finish.  Creamy smoke and not dry at all.  I occasionally get some sweetness kind of chocolaty.   Body is mediumfull right now.  Draw is a little tight but not annoying.  Second ThirdCedar is really noticeable on the draw.  A smooth leather has joined the party on the finish with the red peppers tying it all together.  Still getting some sweetness almost molasses.  Flavors are both smooth and pronounced at the same time without any one thing being overwhelming.  Very nuanced at this point.   Noticing the nicotine now but its not over the top.  Body is maybe a mediumfull probably close to medium.    Last ThirdCedar has fallen off and now its a smooth leather on the draw with the ever present red pepper finish.  Nicotine is continuing to ramp up causing a tingle on the tongue and lips.  Very potent.   Body is medium but strength is definitely strong.   Ended it with an inch and half to go as it was starting to be too much nicotine tingle to really enjoy the flavors anymore.      ImpressionsIve been wanting to get a good base line for what a strong cigar is and glad I picked these up.  I expected this to be nothing but pepper and overwhelming nicotine but surprisingly this is a very nuanced and enjoyable cigar.  I was able to get a box of  tubos of these from Atlantic cigar when they had them for I think  dollars making these an insanely good value.  If you like a strong cigar these are well worth it.,cigars,chrqc9i,1,t5_2r090

I hear they can vary with each one since theyre made from leftover filler leaves and they arent always the same inside.This one started with a nice bit of pepper through the first  before mellowing out into a smoother leathery and chocolatey flavor.Burn was awesome.I didnt want to stop this one at the end so I kept it going for as long as I could till my fingers were getting too hot.Ill be picking up at least a tin of these next time I see them around. And if that doesnt happen Im ordering a box. I loved this quick little smoke all in all it took about  minutes. Paired up with an ice cold cranberry juice went well with it but may have killed a bit of the flavor of the smoke.Great way to end the middle of my work week!

1259012,0,t1_cib7njd,Hey BOTL I know you do not know me from a hole in the sand but I truly know where you are coming from. Im  years old I have severe PTSD from Iraq amp  years in the military grew up fucked up been through every substance abuse imaginable until about  months ago and Im still fighting everyday too.Reason I mention this is that I also happen to have a Masters in Psychology and was a practicing Psychologist for just over  years after grad school prior to deployment. I teach psychological stuff for Homeland now but much like the saying of there is no such thing as a former alcoholic there is also the saying in the mental health field of you have to be a psycho to be a psycho. Psycho being psychologist for the gifted PI will never proclaim to have all the answers. I will never tell you that XYZ is the only way to stave off depression suicidal thoughts twice Ive sat with a shotgun and once with a SampW  in my mouth after coming home from overseas trying my damnedest to pull the trigger but couldnt and the simple struggle like you said of just fucking getting out of bed in the afternoon taking a shower fuck man even eating once a week is beyond crippling. Im more than happy to chat with you over PM or Instant Message over Skype work prohibits video over Skype due to recording anytime that you would like. I only sleep about  maybe  hours a day. I can simply listen I can listen and we can talk about shared experiences just like with cigars you can yell scream defile my mother tell me to pound sand tell me to eat shit and die we can converse back and forth about coping methodologies root causes modern psychological ideologies as they relate to CBT and modern pharmacology or just talk man. It doesnt have to be a fucking thing related to depression or cigars if you will. It can be any topic for any length of time. Its a diversion to get you out of your head and mine frankly. Sometimes thats just what it takes. Just talk man and Ill listen if that is something that you would like. Its just like what I go through daily with addiction fuck man hourly I cant tell you how many times Ive thought about drinking today and its only  its one day at a time. You do the best that you can with what is given to you each day that you are here. It might not seem like the best at the time but when the clock strikes  it was the best that you could do Travis because you are here and its another new day that you are fighting for which says more than any words ever could about the strength of your character and your resolve.James,cigars,cib95og,18,t5_2r090

1271182,0,t3_28mwo7,When I came home from grad school at age  I moved back in with my parents for a while until I found an apartment with a childhood friend as a roommate.  While still living at home I went to the same pool I had gone to as a kid and teenager with my parents and they had this one friend and old guy named Irv who used to bring cigars to the pool but he would get banished to a corner of the grassy area around the pool while everyone else smoked their cigarettes at the card tables.  His wife used to call them his stinkers even though SHE was one of the cigarette smokers.  He smoked cheap machine made fiveinabox Antony y Cleopatras or Garcia y Vegas or something of that caliber but he enjoyed them.The second time I went to the pool that summer having seen Irv smoke a stinker by himself I brought him a couple of premium handrolled  well a couple for US one for him and one for me.   He thanked me but declined he liked his cheapos.  But I fired one up with him and hung out with him while he smoked and while the rest of the group smoked their cigarettes.  This repeated often during that first summer.By the next summer I was in my apartment and didnt go to the pool as often as my apartment complex had its own pool but when I DID I still joined Irv in the corner and had a cigar with him and then after that second year I moved two hours north.Irv died sometime while I was north and when Id go back to my parents pool Id still look in the corner half expecting to see Irv firing up a cheapo and going over to join him.To this day whenever I go to my parents pool I still stand in that same corner and smoke a premium handrolled where Irv and I stood that one summer smoking our cigars.RIP Irv.,cigars,cicmifm,3,t5_2r090

1310624,0,t1_cih1h70,Thanks for the response. I was more thinking about the effect of policy changes. For instance Im in Minnesota and the tobacco tax structure here turns a  stick like an Undercrown into a  stick all over the state. However I can go into Wisconsin and pay  for an Undercrown or  for a Liga Privada No.. My worry is that policy changes on a federal level would turn every state or even the online marketplace into what we see in MN. I dont mind inflation driving the cost of cigars up a quarter or fifty cents at a time but if all the six dollar cigars turned into ten dollar cigars over night because of some new legislation I would be pretty pissed. ,cigars,cih28ce,3,t5_2r090

1322555,0,t3_2989jy,Yes but not easy to do legally gtQ. Is there any exception to the one lighter only rule or the no torch lighters rule?A. You can bring up to two  additional lightersincluding torch lightersin your checked baggage when you use DOTapproved airtight travel containers for lighters. Major lighter manufacturers such as Colibri Prometheus and Zippo have secured DOT special permits for their lighter travel containers. They are available from specialty stores and online. These DOTapproved containers are the only way you can carry the torch lighters that the TSA bans from the aircraft cabin. They are also the only way you can carry lighters in checked baggage unless the lighter contains no fuel see Q.. Most of these containers are designed to hold one lighter some hold two. When shopping for a travel container for your lighter make sure the container is marked with the DOT special permit number and that you read and follow the instructions from the container manufacturer. These DOT special permits only apply to U.S. domestic air travel.Or you can just put it in checked baggage and roll the dice but its an expensive lighter to loose. ,cigars,ciiekd3,2,t5_2r090

1452494,0,t1_cirnjya,Totally works!! Some notes thoughThe brown Boveda packs work the best with this method. If you somehow still have the white ones like I did the recharge works just as well but be wary of chunks in the pack that could puncture it. I also recharged some of the Arturo Fuente Bovedas that come in their boxes. They recharge the same but that Fuente paper will come off of youre not careful. I kept the pouch of the solution to see how and if it would work without the paper. Be warned Boveda solution looks like male reproductive fluidAlso Im making sure the outside of the pack is dry to the touch before putting it back in my humidor. Im not gonna ruin sticks! And if you recharge to full capacity and you already have some Boveda packs in your humi the older ones will absorb some of the recharged moisture.

I think I might try another round and use a longer length of wire to support more of the cigar and have it curve around the edges more but so far this thing seems perfectly functional.After a search on the forums I see Im not the only person who has made an ashtray like this.

What I really got was an Arturo Fuente Hemingway Short story. Which is what it is. The construction was great as always burn perfect. The tastes were the same as any SS. Still an excellent cigar but I guess I got lost in the hype a bit because of its being rare. Its good and I will smoke another if it presents itself.

Compare this with SBs noticed you didnt add your rcigars discount code for your most recent order I went ahead and applied it for you. .

Julio told me that people make some more money on the side by stealing boxes seals and cigars. So they can make their own producht make it legit and be able to sell it. Kid told me that the code didnt work makes sense since the seal was most likely stolen from the factory before it was ever used.

Medium  but tons of flavor and aroma. A Dominican San Vicente is the star of the show in the filler and the Habano Ecuador compliments it very well. La Fortaleza is the cigar that put us on the map.

1681404,0,t3_2dn6bs,Got up this morning fed the kiddo and then noticed there was some black smoke coming up from down the driveway. So like any curious individual I went to see what was up. Upon reaching the bottom of the driveway I came across a terrible scene of wreckage and burning debris everywhere. But oddly there laid a package at just at the foot of my driveway untouched and addressed to me. So in my excitement of receiving a package I completely forgot my dead mailman and the wreckage that laid smoldering in the road and bolted back inside my house to see what this could be. Boy oh boy was I surprised to find an awesome verification trade from a new BOTL who really knows how to quickly become an instant hit with me. Not only did he send the followingKristoff Maduro lanceroRomeo y Julieta Reserva RealGhurka Park Avenue East Indian Trading Co. Gurkha Red Witch Perla del MarHe also sent along some companions an awesome local brewed root beer called Wasatch Bringhams Brew a vinta Skipping Stone summer lager local as well some local chocolate called Amano and a shot glass for REAL Salt Lake soccer team. Which slowly soccer has been growing on me so awesome addition!Anyways awesome package brother and glad to have helped you get your plus! Look forward to!future trades and as a fore warning....warn your mailman and brace your mailbox!Cheers!,cigars,cjr3qyz,3,t5_2r090

1810783,0,t1_ck7btyj,Im not insulting him. Im saying he lacks good judgement and a solid understanding of the role of the AOTM and its importance . As I have said Im not mad just disappointed. He should know better and I expected more from him. As far as the litany at the tail end of your post I do stand against almost everything you mentioned except the Liga. Comparing having the LP as the COTM is easily distinguishable. LPs are available in a host of stores in the US and abroad and are usually in the  to  dollar range here in the states.  Moreover they are available on the primary market. Here we are talking  minimum for one of these sticks and they are only available on the secondary market. As I said it benefits noone but the middleman. I could certainly see how some people might think he had some skin in the game when he made his decision. The real closest comparison would be the TESA Shaman but Ive already heavily distinguished that scenario.  Additionally I would augment my discussion of the CCOTM to note that it was created due to this very scenario where a person picks a rediculously expensive or HTF cigar. ,cigars,ck7di6c,8,t5_2r090

His first message was about creeping my posts and he nailed a few of the sticks Ive enjoyed the most. Second post? Laundry list of quality sticks that he likes with a couple left off the list so theyre surprises in the verification trade and he lets slip that he worked in BampM in college. Gentlemen this is no rube that weve welcomed. We got a badass over here!He sent LA Aurora Letros Padron  Natural LFD  Natural Davidoff Demi TasseThat last one? Yeah he left a note that its not as part of the trade  I guess he thinks thats going to make me only send him  sticks. Normally that might work no it wouldnt.

Instead I have and will continue to try to work with people to address their issues.  Does it mean theyll get everything they want?  Nope just as we see here.  What the folks calling for Nicks head are forgetting or dont know is the massive amount of work that he puts into the sub to keep spam and such off the front page in addition to his CSS and graphical work.

The Four Kicks is a beautiful cigar. Almost pornographic. After lighting the flavor is...bitter? But not in a bad way. After a couple minutes I place it as something akin to walnuts with a pleasant aftertaste a mix of slight sweetness and maybe cinnamon? And only a slight pepper on the retrohale. Along the way a cedary flavor joins the mix with the pepper rising in the retrohale to have quite a bite but thats entirely possible to be caused by me smoking faster. Its cold. The smoke is nice and thick as it wafts away into the night sky. At the end I have really enjoyed this cigar and Im sad to see it go. My first two sticks from Crowned Heads have blown me away and Im looking forward to a Headley Grange and getting my hands on a Jericho Hill.TLDR Those guys down in Nashville really know how to make a fine cigar! ,cigars,ckhr1c2,5,t5_2r090

1959948,0,t3_2gzoss,I too was at a My FatherTatuaje event last week. It wasnt at my BampM considering I took a  hour bus drive to get to this place and it wasnt even a real event to push sales just a Meet amp greet before the InterTabac trade show.Even though it wasnt a sales event I bought a box of the new Tattoo and a box of Pudgy Monsters and Pete came over to offer singing the box before I even had the chance to ask him.If any one of you ever has the chance to go and meet Pete Johnson absolutely do it. The guy is a pleasure to talk to and be around as were Janny and Jaime Garcia who sadly almost no one talked to but maybe thats because Jaimes english is very broken and everyones afraid to ask Janny to translate. I went and asked them to sign the box too since My Father and Tatuaje is one big family. And this is what it looks like. Very neat evening smoked a La Antiguedad no freebies but great memories.,cigars,ckpdjef,1,t5_2r090

1965906,0,t3_2h75uy,At the stage I am in which is smoking for about a year and just starting to be able to discern flavors I have to make a conscious decision to review a stick and pay attention to it the whole way through even before lighting. I usually write the review in rough format at the same time as I am smoking. I chose my pairing differently as well such as water instead of a beer or whatever. I am dicking around taking pictures. The amount of time and thought that goes into trying to do a decent review even a newbie review would surprise people.  I smoke completely different when just relaxing or working around the yard. I pay way less attention to the stick and just pretty much smoke it. I will still try to detect flavors and get excited when I do but it is much less formal there is no agenda and it is far more relaxing.I find both styles enjoyable in different ways and it is really nice when you get some comments or upvotes on a review you worked on specifically for the sub.,cigars,ckq3crb,2,t5_2r090

2049929,0,t3_2iaax0,Good review!!gtBig vitolas generally burn hotter due to the larger cherry but this pig is at the temp of a lancero.I believe this is backwards... Large vitolas burn more cool than smaller RGs because of the larger volume of air passing over the cherry and down the larger barrel... Small RG vitolas Lanceros especially are notorious for burning hot because every bit of hot air is channeled straight into your mouth like a straw instead of being cooled by the relatively large amount of filler and cooler air available in a large RG.,cigars,cl0e33j,3,t5_2r090

I think coolerdors are a better long term option for space but throwing some cedar in the tupperdorcoolerdor works just as well as having the humidor. If you notice changes in a cigar that has been in your humidor for less than a year its probably just from acclimating to the consistent RH not the fact that its surrounded by cedar. Aging in the sense that people think of it takes closer to  years and in some peoples opinions .

2140692,0,t1_clbxdqe,you are correct on what a touch up is. if you have one part of the wrapper that isnt burning as fast as the rest try holding that part on the underside of the cigar. this can help it even out. for me it seems like preference on what to use for corrections. i use a single flame torch but a soft flame or match will work too. i purge after a correction and ive never really noticed any bad flavors after manual touch ups. im a bit more ocd than most so i tend to give it a little help earlier than some others would. you just want to be careful not to blast the wrapper if youre using a torch. i just sort of clip the top of the area that isnt burning and let it catch up on its own.,cigars,clbxgo8,3,t5_2r090

Appologies friends D Allow me to go more in depth...So the context thing to me is HUGE because as a FNG I need material to learn and if all I see is Look  dat gurka then I will get discouraged and walk away almost knowing less than before. The flip side is if you keep it text only context based its easy to see who puts in time with their work. I am not saying you need to do a  min review via typing to put in work but I would love to see more than  lines. Also if low context is a thing maybe we can push that person to a better spot and help them with it too I dont think people always post minimal context on purpose so lets help them!I think overall its just nice and really feeds a better community to have it this way. I was not sure at first bc omg the karmas but if thats your thing pay it forward in the form of a bomb to a new guy just starting or give it to someone that you have learned from I think the pros FAAAAAAAAAAR outweigh the cons in this situation.

I mean I know not everyone is familiar with unwritten BOTL code but treating cigars which are clearly meant to be smoked in celebration when offered at a wedding like hotel toiletaries is a bit iffy to me.

So fair enough I didnt but I still put a RJ No.  in my jacket. When the fire pits were lit I fired up the stick and lo and behold  just about everyone is asking got any more of those?

2880717,0,t3_2t43q6,Pairing a cigar with a peaty scotch is a little tricky in my opinion. Laga  and a Liga  has paired well for me but sometimes I want to taste more scotch than cigar and vice versa.  Does that makes sense?My best advice is to give a few different cigars a chance and as a general rule of thumb pair lighter smokes typically a Cameroon or Habano wrapper...also many Cubans with a lighter scotch Glenlevit Macallanetc. and a peaty scotch with a full flavor Maduro wrapper or something with a lot of ligero. Trying out pairings is a lot of fun.  Enjoy!,cigars,cnvjg3k,1,t5_2r090

2921145,0,t3_2tfsq0,My cigar barlounge is amazing. Im going to start with that. I was a regular before I moved to my night shift now Im lucky to be out there once a month. The barpatio are both wonderful spaces but they can get full on busy nights. About a year ago they opened up a lounge sponsored by Ashton. The lounge has the same chairs and everything the normal bar has but a little more space as they dont have a bar on that side. It also has  TVs I think which is more than the main bar. When it started the prices were month for lounge membership access only  for a humidorlocker in which you are only allowed to store sticks you got there I have about  boxes  bags of sticks and a bottle of tequila in mine or  a month for lockeraccess and  in store credit. Ive heard these have changed a bit. While they dont offer discounts off sticks over all they have events on a regular basis where you get discounted sticks  sometimes special members only sample packs as you would at any event. The advantage is you get a nice time to meet and talk to the repblenderowneretc closer and normally a free stick or two for showing up. Quite often they will also have liquor tastings which are free for members. On top of this for big events you get a priority chance to order packages and sometimes even a discount on the event. The hours are the same as the bar but thats not too much of a worry for me. Ive been debating it its worth it as I have the top package and cant get out there too often but when I do get out there I enjoy it. For me Id be fine not being a member but its nice to know if I ever get out there on a busy night I have a much better chance at getting a chair than I would in the bar or on the patio.,cigars,co055tx,1,t5_2r090

The people youve met perhaps but theres no location with such a mentality for everyone there or most there. There are many people in a community after all and you go to specific places. As for being rude by asking that may be a possible perception or it may not in majority but  that isnt the majority view across the country or else you would have had some very different developmental or restriction laws I wasnt trying to defend him I was simply trying to show you that he has a very majority view and further while he may have come across as rude without really knowing what he was thinking or expecting to classify him is simply wrong. As for overstepping bounds perhaps and perhaps not but even so every human steps over boundaries when it comes to expressing themselves this includes yourself and me too because that is human nature we may not do it all the time but we do it all the same.Anyway I still feel my last reply is appropriate.,cigars,cp80sg9,-3,t5_2r090

Been to Cuba several times know many more who have gone dozens of time spent time on the farms know the rollers some Habanos execs etc.  Tons of excellent torceadors both longstanding and up and coming. The ranks have grown greatly since the crappy  tent peg era.  The soil is top notch.  Bad weather has ruined a lot of leaf the past two years not shitty soil.  But still they output some phenomenal cigars.  No imported tobacco no exported tobacco.  Just more stupid lies by bitter expats.  And sure they have their reasons to be bitter but enough is enough. If your product is that great then let the market decide. Right now the worldwide market for CCs continues to grow.  Cubas politics stays out of the tobacco fields.  The Vegueros before Castro didnt get kicked off their farms back in the day.  Theyre still around or their descendants are.  Stop spouting off these lies.  There is no veracity to your statements.  I know too many oldtimers who practically live there that see the machinations of the industry from seed to banded cigar.

3513419,0,t1_cpsfbcj,The proximity of the leaf means the flavours will literally meld  flavours of one will move into another and vice versa.  This makes for a more consistent smoke.Also I know at least with pipe tobacco a lot of the starchy sugars break down into sap which then crystallizes.  This happens anaerobically because you age pipe tobacco in a sealed environment.  There is debate about the role microbes play in consuming oxygen to do this.This differs from cigar aging in that you dont seal the cigars in something airtight  in fact I think cigars need to offgas as they age or they get acrid edit ammonia stank.Im guessing a big factor in cigars mellowing is due to the notairtight environment  the flavour of the tobacco is literally though gradually seeping out of the cigar and blowing away.  Cigars contain much more tobacco than the equivalent smoke length of a bowl of pipe tobacco so it has less of an impact.  But ask any pipe smoker what tobacco tastes like when its been stored in a ziploc bag for  months.  The flavour of the tobacco seeps out through the plastic remember plastic is water tight not air tight nor scent particle tight and it ends up tasting like smoking cardboard.,cigars,cpsr764,2,t5_2r090

If you enjoy a cigar or you enjoy a whisky why would your understanding of how it is produced change that enjoyment?Perception is everything. Theres a reason why whisky companies dont prominently advertise this information and the same is true for cigar companies.People make emotional judgments based on an incomplete understanding.gt What big names use it and which ones dont?By Scottish law you can look for scotch products that are advertised as natural means that no coloring has been added. A bottle labelled as nonchill filtered means that chill filtration has not been used to remove compounds in the whisky that will turn it cloudy when water is added.,cigars,cpxxvg7,2,t5_2r090

3598309,0,t1_cq2f9kh,I never denied a nicotine buzz with a cigar. You will still get a nicotine buzz indeed just like you get one from chewing nicotine gum or from using a nicotine patch. What I am saying is that only a rapid dump of dopamine is addictive in nature as far as true nicotine addiction goes. You still have dopamine release again stated above already but it is not rapid. Of course if you were to inhale cigars it would be much more potent then cigarettes but that is not the point at hand because you dont inhale cigars and if you do you have much worse things to be afraid of than addictions metaplasia and neoplasms. I am strictly talking in the true fashion that a cigar is smoked there should be little to no risk of addiction unless you have an addictive personality. I can point you to plenty of scholarly resources if you would like me to. I can even send you the podcast for the hour long lecture for smoking cessation I had to sit through for medical school. PS I am not the one downvoting you... I dont play those games. ,cigars,cq2fm8h,6,t5_2r090

3602638,0,t1_cq2vhev,TLDR Guy takes a trip to Cuba and then takes a big shit on their cigars. As interesting as the article is the guy seems to both know what hes talking about and not know what hes talking about simultaneously. Or maybe its just me getting that vibe.It raises some important questions in my mind regarding the validity of what hes saying. Without getting into the numerous places where it completely contradicts what Ive read about Cuba as well as experienced for myself there if everything is so haphazard then the consistency and quality is mind boggling. I have several PSD in my humidor as its one of my favorite smokes. Many of them are from different years and yet they all look absolutely identical. I mean I cant tell them apart at all they are exactly the same. The only way I know is by where I place them in my humidor. I dont see how this level of product could be possible if the production in Cuba is as shanty as its made out to be there.I havent watched the OP video so sorry if this is redundant.What are your thought Mr. Cavejohnson ?,cigars,cq2xczv,2,t5_2r090
3603001,0,t1_cq2yigc,Hmm Ive never really heard about that smoke angle interesting. I love piramide and torpedo for a couple reasons. First is that the draw is totally adjustable depending on the cut. Second is the way the taper feels against the lips. Third is the gradual increase in RG with the piramide I always feel like it adds another dynamic and feels great in the hand. Oh and I guess fourth is the aesthetic appeal I just love the shape especially if its box pressed then the deal is really sealed. Cheers!,cigars,cq2yunt,1,t5_2r090

3624299,0,t3_31fhmm, So last night I had a cigar nightmare.  I remember coming home from work to a package waiting for me in my kitchen.  I open it up and its a box of Edmundo Dantes!!  My eyes widen with excitement and waste no time lighting one up.  I remember picking one up out of the box the shape was odd color was odd felt real soft but I proceed to light it up anyways. As I am smoking I realize I am getting nothing out of it.  Flavor was off the touch of the cigar felt weird the smell was different.  So I lay it down on the ash tray and proceed to inspect the rest of the box. I pick up another cigar out of the box and it is just deformed such a weird shape looked like a turd.  I start rolling the cigar around in my fingers trying to feel how good the roll is.  I then notice this weird slug looking thing start crawling on my hand I am like beetles? But it didnt look like beetles like tiny little slugs.  So I continue rolling the cigar around in my fingers and the damn thing just disintegrates and all these beetles and slugs come crawling out all over my hand.  My hand was covered in them and they were making their way up my arm! I freaked out and ran upstairs to check my humidor to make sure it wasnt compromised.  I then woke up realized my hand was asleep LOL.,cigars,cq5eau8,2,t5_2r090

At the same time a very med to full strength. Woodsy cedar leather notes. Light spice left on the back of the tongue with a bit of chocolate flavor. For  bucks for  sticks it was a no brainer for me.

3660151,0,t3_329372,I am a student at the University of Michigan dual majoring in Political Science and Arabic Language though Im also brushing up on my French which is a surprisingly useful supplementary language in many Middle Eastern countries and I am a member of the Michigan Research Community. I am currently helping out with research mostly compiling data in the Linguistics department and applying the paradigm of Critical Discourse Analysis to the Ukrainian Crisis and seeing if the discourse compares to the Cuban Missile Crisis. I was recently awarded a grant to conduct my own research project so I will be staying in Ann Arbor this summer. I will be nineteen on April . I am rather new to the world of cigars. My first one was on my eighteenth birthday and was an offbrand party store cigar that was labeled Its a Boy which I found hilarious. I very quickly learned that one shouldnt buy offbrand cigars with novelty names even if they are funny. I used to just buy a cigar at the store and just smoke with my friend but this winter I finally decided to buy a humidor. Poor diet during high school made me slightly chubby so I used cigars as a mechanism for losing weight. For every week or so that I avoid fast foodsoda I reward myself with a cigar to add to my collection. Ive since lost twenty five pounds. For the sake of my health I avoid smoking them more than once a week or two but that only means that my collection has grown.As for my hobbies? I play the violin ten years or so now ukelele mandolin bass Irish Pennywhistle and I sing in the Mens Glee Club. I used to do a lot of theatre but have lacked the time since starting college. I hope to get involved in a production or two this summer. Ive played my violin in Carnegie Hall and paid for the trip there by being a street musician for a summer. I also love learning other languages outside my studies and hope to pick up some Farsi and Esperanto this Summer. I also consider myself an aquarium enthusiast. I hope to somehow get into woodworking in the future as Im fascinated by people who can do such wonders with wood hehe but seriously.I look forward to filling up this humidor and many more! in the near future.,cigars,cq9hdw6,2,t5_2r090

They did not do this out of the kindness of their hearts.gtRight or wrong they provided a small discount to their customers.

4467630,0,t1_csttd5r,The thread linked below is better information but the TLDR of the whole thing is that yes they are a complete replacement. They are little packages that keep your humidor humidified. You simply open the pack the ones I get are wrapped in cellophane and put it in. My humidor has a little cedar plank bottom that I can remove so I generally put mine under that.Still go get a hygrometer so you can measure the humidity. The packs last for only a period of time before they have to be replaced. I am sure there are  factors on how often yours will need to be replaced but I replace mine every couple of months unless I am opening and closing the humidor often depends on how much I smoke.Good luck!,cigars,csttjwb,2,t5_2r090

4485900,0,t3_3ci4g1,Slow down and dont hesitate to purge.  A lot of stuff builds up in lanceros as you smoke so blow it out into a flame and burn it off.  Should improve the draw and flavor.  As others have said lanceros often suffer from tight draw because of poor construction.  If thats the case sometimes a draw tool can help.  Just be careful if you go that route because its incredibly easy to poke through the wrapper.  I always use a guillotine for lanceros.  If you smoke too fast or pull too hard with a tight draw you may get some tar in which case youll need to cut again.I love lanceros.  While conceding Mr Sakas point about the blend limitations I find the higher wrapperfiller ratio can lead to some exquisite smokes.  It doesnt always work and its obviously not everyones cup of tea.  I wouldnt waste a lot of time or money trying to like something if its just not your bag.  I wouldnt give up on them until you work out the draw issue but thats about it.,cigars,csw40di,2,t5_2r090

4590559,0,t3_3dvajp,Something is afoot here.  The cigars dont look great compared to all the Genios Ive seen.  The packaging looks right though.  Ive heard that AltadisSpanish stock has become somewhat suspect.  I could see fuck ups in the packaging department as demand to move cigars can fall victim to supplies at hand.  Habanos vs Cohiba hinges?  Ive seen both as well.  My Genios came out of an LCDH several years back and have the Habanos hinges.  If you recall the  release the outer box was oversized for the wooden box.  A last minute fuckup.  As for the vendors CoH is pretty solid.  With that said there are some ugly looking cigars coming out of Cuba these days.  Some vendors turn them back by the mastercase if not satisfied.  My buddy works at the Montreal LCDH and had to send back a few boxes of PSDs with practically Candella wrappers!  Did you do a serial  verification check?  Go here,cigars,ct98hp9,3,t5_2r090

But I can see where it would make other female members uncomfortable and devalued and thats a huge problem.  The cigar community is already enough of a good old boy society as it is.  The guy talk aspect of it isnt ever going away.  I think most women understand that and are probably ok with it to a certain point.  But a line has to be drawn so that culture doesnt become hostile or unwelcoming toward SOTLs.  If it comes down to girls posting naked pics or women who participate and have something of substance to contribute Ill take the latter any day.  There are a million places to see nude women on the internet.  True SOTLs are much more valuable and desirable for a cigar forum.,cigars,cttjsbz,2,t5_2r090

The experience that really got me into cigars was when my best man bought me a Padron Family Reserve for my bachelor party. Once I smoked that it changed my opinion that if it wasnt a Cuban it wasnt worth my time. While Cubans are still my preferred smoke I have found quit a few nonCuban sticks that are amazing. Padron and A. Fuente are my favorite brands now but Im still all over the place trying everything on this cigar adventure. ,cigars,cvvv43d,1,t5_2r090

5717755,0,t3_3tg0ah,I would go the route of saying they are DR cigars but the fact that the spreadsheet indicates Box of Cuban Cigars it appears that they are violating OFAC regs.  Even if you want to claim that someone can give away their  worth of Cubans to another person who never visited the island which is contradicted by the OFAC in this FAQgtIn addition travelers areauthorized to acquire in Cuba and import as accompanied baggage into the United Statesmerchandise with a value not to exceed  per person provided that no more than  of themerchandise consists of alcohol or tobacco products and the merchandise is imported for personaluse only.Even if you toss that out the value they place on it is .  Way over the  limit.  So unless its a box that they built from several folks buying a few Montes at a time... its very likely a violation.,cigars,cx5udpk,5,t5_2r090

Pulled from the Sobremesa Circle Jerk thread last week which I gladly participated in.  Can you fill us in on the decision to go with this artwork rather than a complete original?  What ties if any does the Sobremesa share with the La Lunda?I apologize if this has been covered already.  I love you. ,cigars,cxin9mq,3,t5_2r090

5831521,0,t1_cxin9mq,I missed the circle jerk.. oh well. Hope it was enjoyable for some... ltsnickergtThis is a copy of a reply I posted earlier to a question that was regretfully down voted. As I said there I have no issue with anyone asking me any question this is an AMA.  I have reposted the answer for all to read but at the bottom I added some extra content.Thanks!As I stated before the Vista art work is not original or my own creation nor have I ever tried to pass it off as such.The La Lunda vista IMO was one of the greatest pieces of cigar art ever created. The brand debut in  but was already gone by ... I guess the cigar wasnt as nice as the art.  Anyhow I saw my first La Lunda label about  years ago and bought it.. really poor condition. While the image itself is nice what really makes this bit of cigar art impressive is the engravingembossing  it is by far one of the most meticulous and intricate sculpted labels I have ever seen. Since that time I have bought five other copies of this vista always with the plan of someday bringing it back to life.It took about  hours of digital reconstruction of the image itself to get back to a condition where it could be printed in dpi on modern presses while still having that authentic stone lithography feel.  The embossing was a totally different beast. We tried to create it using digital files and modern cnc engravers but I just could never get it to have the right feel or beauty of the original. And that was the entire point to begin with I wanted to pay the respect to this amazing piece of cigar art it deserved.  Ultimately I ended up contracting a Master Gun Engraver in Germany to hand engrave the entire plate from scratch with nothing more than an image and one of the originals to reference. It took him nearly eight weeks and cost me over  Euros but imo it was TOTALLY WORTH IT!  Just run your fingers over the Vista and you will understand the incredible level of workmanship.  I am very proud to have resurrected this amazing piece of cigar art. It pays homage to the beauty of cigars and the work invested in the endeavor.  Fwiw the cost of the work is not in the price of the product. I paid for this out of my personal pocket because it simply was something I always wanted to do.Extra Content  As for the ring I do not know what the original looked like. I decided to use the Crown design from the Vista as I thought it would be unique and make for an elegant presentation.  As for the name I never really liked the La Lunda name... and I have no clue what it meant then or might mean now. So I always knew I need an new name and imo Sobremesa is perfect.The DTT logo is original but Warranty Seal is a combination of a variety of images from old stock certificates that were modified with some custom design elements created to make the finished piece. I am a collector of this turn of the century ephemera as I cant help but admire the level of detail and artistry.I have disclosed this to everyone when discussing the brands packaging design and I believe it was written about in detail in the original CA story introducing the brand.,cigars,cxk1euu,2,t5_2r090

6737411,0,t3_47xqns,This all really depends on each individuals taste preferences.  I think when smoking a cigar an important question to ask yourself is does my experience and enjoyment of this cigar match the price point? If it does then it was worth the price paid. I have had cigars from a range of prices that were awful and phenomenal. Ultimately there are cigars at every price range that are amazing.The only way you will ever know if its worth paying extra is if you pick up a  stick every now and then a try it. If you are a Padron fan I recommend the th Maduro or Natural. First expensive cigar I ever had absolutely worth every penny. I to this day always have a few for special occasions waiting in my coolerdor. As far as the video is concerned I feel wine is similar yet different from cigars.

6921886,0,t3_4aj2af,maybe not something for each individual review but rather part of the info that is linked for each tobacco but what about flavor profiles expected from the types of tobaccos? Sort of breaking down the expected flavors by leaf type so I can see what each leaf contributes to the overall blend. This could go along with the different wrappers you mentioned in your post. This way if I know what flavors say Dominican Piloto lend to the blend I would then know if that is something that would draw me to another stick without having to play hit or miss with the names of tobaccos alone.

7137756,0,t1_d1phaoe,Well part of the issue is that many of the comments existed in your original lets talk thread which has been deleted not really sure I understand why either. I recognize its a complicated issue but to me it seems that some members may be receiving preferential treatment. When the number  upvoted post in response to your question was to ban them then it would seem the community has spoken. It wasnt slightly higher than the devils advocate post either it was  points. A significant difference. How does this play into the idea of preferential treatment? Not saying its happening just the appearance. Because the guys who sell the most are the guys typically with the biggest collections and those are typically the guysgals with the longest time on the sub thus it appears they are being appeased over the wishes of the peasants ,cigars,d1phh7y,1,t5_2r090

I would probably throw in a boveda pack and at least double bag them to keep it seals as best as possible or have them get a dollar store tupperware at least. Cheap cutter maybe some matches or like a cheap djeep or jetline.   ,cigars,d1rvvu0,3,t5_2r090

Its bolder and spicier than many of the others but its still pretty mellow for a Nicaraguan blend.The Undercrown is earthy and spicy. Not really my style but I figured if you havent gotten to try one yet you probably should.CAO Flavours are pretty good flavored cigars.

7482812,0,t3_4hv6hn,So back in  I was working for a racing company as an Advertising Assistant.  I was showing product at the Temecula Rod Run and I had run out of cigarettes.  I saw this smoke shop across the way and thought well maybe they will have something that would tide me over.My preferred brand was Kamel Red and I saw they had all  types of American Spirit which was a close second.  I ask for the smokes and this tall bald headed handlebar mustache wearing gentleman across the counter said in the most polite way Why the hell are you smoking those Gawd Damn things?!  Theyll kill ya!He then proceeded to take me around his shop and show me the humidor and gift me a couple sticks.  Shawn quickly became a mentor of mine.  He showed me the value of hard work.  He showed me that it was okay to take a break and focus on yourself.  He also taught me several life lessons over excellent sticks.Ive gone back to cigarettes a couple times but finally completely quit around  years ago.  Ive had one cigarette since and it made me sick to my stomach.,cigars,d2sr5nz,3,t5_2r090

The Natural Dirt was my first premium cigar and I really enjoyed it. Havent had another one since but thats another story. What Im wanting to understand is thisEverything Ive read about the Natural line on here states that these cigars use pipe tobacco in them. Where does this information come from? Also there are several varieties of pipe tobacco Burleys Virginias Orientals Latakia Perique and dozens of subcategories... So which pipe tobaccos do the Naturals use? I understand that this varies between vitolas too. Maybe the DE rep could shed some light? ,cigars,d3dmc9k,1,t5_2r090

Make sure youre rotating as you smoke bottom burns faster AFAIK and obviously make sure the cherry is full and even before you start smoking. ,cigars,d58t7da,1,t5_2r090

8912038,0,t1_d7ixvfc,I agree on opus X fuente fuente. They are excellent smoke but at the price most shops have them at Id rather let the golfers buy them.I dont know if I can bring myself to use the word perfect for anything but these are getting close. Its not just the blend but the construction. The bonchero has to get the right type of leaf in the right part of the cigar for the flavors to develop the way the blender intends while still burning right. Im horrible describing flavors but Ill try. The Carlito starts out with a creamy flavor that reminds me of some Cubans a moderate spice and a hint of sweetness. The first couple of puffs can be deceptively mild. As you continue the sweetness remains but the other flavors take center stage in turn as you make it through the cigar the spiciness picks up and I normally get some cedar.  The series B brings the same type of complexity with different flavors taking center stage as you smoke but the mild sweetness is different as you get the flavors from that rich Ecuadorian maduro wrapper.  The don Carlos is excellent as well but its been awhile since Ive smoked it I think Id confuse what I remember with the Carlito and Ive never had the anniversary series.  So ya the price means something different for each of us and Ill be the first person to tell you theres plenty of excellent sticks lower price but if you periodically pick up a higher cost stick like i do to try it out these should be on the list. ,cigars,d7j3hoy,1,t5_2r090

As a newbie to the cigar lifestyle theres a lot that I havent tried but Ive began to make a list and your cigars are definitely at the top of the list.My question for you is how do you decide what vitola youre going to make a new cigar in?  Is there a deep thought process that goes into that or do you just pick random sizes and go with it?  Im favoring shorter cigars more and more lately and a Luchador Little Guy would be right up my alley.  The El Hombre will do for now though.,cigars,d85ubd7,1,t5_2r090

9723053,0,t3_5ec9ji,Yes. I have had a  year old cigar that wasnt strong to begin with and its definitely past its prime. It taste fine but its lost a lot compared to a younger. Blend plays a big factor in being a good candidate to age or not but also storage. Something stable is going to keep better than something with a lot of fluctuations that affect the cigars oils and its flavor retention. That of course gets a lot more iffy on cigars as old as youre asking about...often times it seems old cigars have passed a few hands or come from estates where it could have a drop in care by relatives. If possible find vendors who deal in aged cigars to ensure a better stored item. ,cigars,dabku6h,1,t5_2r090

Not because I like the shop or the selection all that much but because its between work and my apartment and they have  off cigars on Sundays. Last time I checked they had a box of AF Between the Lines for ea after the discount. Thought I might try one next time I go through. I also like Cigars amp More in Trussville my family is from Gadsden and my wife is from Crossville so we drive right past Trussville when we go home for a visit and they have a couple of other sister stores. I know one of them is on  and another is under the name Vitola so Id expect both of those to be good too. Dees is a package store that happens to have a walkin humidor but Cigars amp More is a fullon cigar shop with events and some HQ stock the whole nine yards. Check out their website if you have time. Honorable mention goes to The Briary Its mainly a pipe shop. They have a huge selection of pipes and pipe tobacco but they also have a pretty big walkin humidor with a decent selection of gars. Oh and The Briary is in an old historical house that oozes character. The lounge there is something you should check out at least once. Edit  Short Stories makes no sense...

9832865,0,t3_5g33u9,Ill tell the tale of my very first cigar and the wild party night that ensued after. This all took place at Queens University in Kingston ON. This was my first year of university and I had just come back from the Christmas Holidays. Having been given some money by family I had decided I wanted to try some cigars and share with me and my good friends. I went to the single cigar shop in town and bought a er of Guantanamera Tubos because they said Cuba on them and were decently cheap. Got back to the residence where me and my other football player colleagues broke open the cigars realized we didnt have a cutter and used our teeth to make an opening. Once the cigars were going we all started passing around the whiskey and wine bottles getting ready for a night of partying. One of my buddies about  minutes into his cigar had to quit because well he didnt realize you werent supposed to inhale. Once the cigars were done and the wine and whiskey were out we headed for the student ghetto in search of the Jewish Frat House which was throwing a kegger that night. We finally reached the kegger only to find out it was packed and decided to head downtown because some of the seniors on the football team were bouncing at the club and we knew they would let us in despite being underage. We get to the bar and Im pretty wasted at this point now being young and drunk in a university town bar is a recipe for disaster as drunk me decided that the bar tender was hitting on me and I had a shot. Well  later I was informed i didnt have a shot and me and my buddies left back to the residence. We get back to the residence around  in the morning and decided that the circular shaped dorm would make a perfect racing track. So we decided to take some rolling office chairs and have races around the residence at  in the morning. Well that ended as well as one could imagine with my best friend getting sick from going around in circles. He passed out on his floor and i passed out in his bed. The next morning I wake up in a haze smelling of booze and bad decisions. I noticed we still had some cigars left so I grabbed one and went for a long walk along the water front to try and clear my head. About  minutes in i realized that . I liked the idea of going for a walk to clear my head with a cigar. . Guantanameras that I had bought were terrible and I needed to start learning about cigars. Many years later here I am still good friends with all the guys from that night. And we still get together semiregularlywe all went our separate ways after school for a smoke and to reminisce about the good old days. ,cigars,dap8sjo,3,t5_2r090

10060278,0,t3_5jpd2r, Cost Pipes are way cheaper smoketosmoke. Compare  for a nice cigar one smoke to  for a whole tin of nice pipe tobacco  smokes. A good cob can be had for  give or take and from there you can decide whether its worth buying a briar.  Flavors Different but theres a much wider array of flavors to be had with pipe tobacco. Cigars are a thousand variations on a single theme while pipe tobacco has  different varietals which can be cured aged and blended in innumerable different ways. Each pipe tobacco manufacturer has their own interesting quirks too. Like McClellands virginia blends smell like ketchup but taste amazing for example. That said youll find that pipe smoke is thinner. The flavor is still there but youre not gonna get thick chewy clouds like with a cigar unless youre smoking certain blends.  Time required Less than a cigar usually. Again this depends on the blend and the type of cigar though. I typically expect  minutes out of a typical smoke session.  Maintenance required The act of pipe smoking is MUCH higher maintenance than cigar smoking. Cigars are pretty much plugnplay. You cut the cap toast and light and then smoke it down. With pipes you have to set out the tobacco dry it pack it char the top of the tobacco to form an ash then tamp that down then light it again. Then depending on the blend and your packing method youll have to deal with relights and running pipe cleaners down the stem to remove moisture. Storage Pipe tobacco is way easier to store than cigars. You dont have to worry about humidorstupperdorswineadors boveda packs monitoring RH and temperature etc. Just throw your tobacco in a mason jar and dont worry about it. Unscrew the lid when you want some tobacco and screw the lid back on when youve got out what you want to smoke. End of story. They both have their pros and cons but theyre both wonderful. Thats why I do both!,cigars,dbivmwf,1,t5_2r090

Naturally everyones tasteslikes are different and you cant tell people what to like. So by all means provide info about the flavor notes the type of wrapper the burn the draw etc and let them decide. But absolutely throw in your own personal opinion as a separate aside by rating it like smoke again buy again box worthy etc like Hemingway suggested. Just as an aside I used to follow this movie review website back in college called Spill. They were based out of Austin and after they talked about a movie theyd each rate it as something you should see as a rental a matinee or a full price. I always appreciated that input and Id imagine your audience would feel the same about cigars if you had a similar ranking system. ,cigars,dbx51ez,2,t5_2r090

11584413,0,t3_65ccaj,I am fairly new to the cigar hobby  months so I cant say with any certainty that no storing the cigars properly are the cause for the nausea you are describing. In my experience this is more likely caused from the strength of the cigar. Since you smoke a cigar so rarely I would recommend a lighter more mildmedium stick. As far as cigar storage is concerned there is no need to an expensive humidor. All you need is some Tupperware with an airtight seal and a Boveda pack to maintain the humidity. That can be done for about the price of a case of Natural Light. Hope that helps and welcome to the hobby. Stay smokey. ,cigars,dg93m7p,2,t5_2r090
