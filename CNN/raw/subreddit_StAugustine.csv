1321262,0,t3_297s65,The Columbia restaurant has great food and a nice ambiance for dates   Also the new Ice Plant Bar iceplantbar.com has more of a city nightlife feel and good food and drinks from what Ive heard. The St. Augustine Lighthouse does a wine and moonlight night but check the schedule to see if theyll be doing it while youre here. Then stop in at The Chocolate Turtle for dessert after dinner. There are lots of good places to eat here. Hope you have a wonderful visit!,StAugustine,cii9c1g,2,t5_2sfnn
