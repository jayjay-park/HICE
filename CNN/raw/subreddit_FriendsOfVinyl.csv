3875323,0,t3_330tce,I was told that using powered speakers doesnt solve the problem if they dont have a built in phono preams in them as the signal from the turntable would still be too low and require an additional phono preamp.  Maybe these speakers have that? But I couldnt find it on the page if they did?  also see to help inform where my confusion comes from  ,FriendsOfVinyl,cqy0qlo,1,t5_33fhu
