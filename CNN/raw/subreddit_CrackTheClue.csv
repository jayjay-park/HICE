8281290,0,t3_4suoyy,Very very interesting. I wish we knew if MMKs comment was  BS or not because while this all seems accurate it could just be a crazy coincidence and with OSRS being so big especially now with Zeah Im sure well run into lots more coincidences. Id say his comment was just a joke simply because we were also told that we have everything we need ingame implying we dont need outside clues from mods. Though maybe farther down the line we wouldve figured out the relevancy of this clue to necromancy anyway and MMK was actually giving a clue guess theres no way to tell but this theory does sound somewhat promising. And I originally thought he thought Highwayman was so funny because it worked and he had no clue but it does match up to your theory here as well. Hmmmm.....,CrackTheClue,d5cpxwp,3,t5_3fd1e

8390733,0,t3_4ukfmt,This is the fake week  clue.It was confirmed a troll quite a few times. I dont believe any posts get removed here. It would also be odd if by putting all four of these clues together you needed a fake fifth clue.Also as Ive personally tried it those lines dont make a difference in the fake clue. You can spell TEN N FIVE W quite well with the first three anyways using the fake fourth is hard to line up and doesnt add to anything. ,CrackTheClue,d5qe0tc,5,t5_3fd1e

What if the biggest clue has been in the title all along and the word Crack has something to do with the solution.Remember that arrow on Xerics lookout? The one pointing West?...Or is it pointing at something else? A crack in a ground?

11475437,0,t1_dfwpe6s,Not necessarily back when this first came out we kept solving one piece after another.  However since Nature rune island we have had many theories that seem to fit our current information.  We as a sub are all split on certain theories.  We need to systematically work through the top few theories and find any discrepancy in the logic and move away from that theory.  The faster we all agree on a certain theory the more resources we can devote to solving.  I think Kieren want to simply state that there are currently so many theories that it would be hard to see if anyone was progressing. ,CrackTheClue,dfwqipw,0,t5_3fd1e
