3711548,0,t3_32rg04,I say keep on playing but amp up the difficulty so we can have more drama and a higher chance of the colony crashing and burning resulting in us going over to A anyways.As for mods if we do get them I think we should try to get mods that dont change the gameplay all that much. Just my opinion but I feel like we shouldnt just dump in a bunch of mods all at once.,StoriesOfRimworld,cqfcbdc,2,t5_37kqf
