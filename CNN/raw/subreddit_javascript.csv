27937,0,t1_cehhe1u,Inline javascript requires global variables which are just bad practice in general and moreso in javascript due to how scope works.Unobtrusive javascript means a website degrades gracefully progressively enhances the page and improves usability.

163580,0,t1_cewysrh,Sure the source is on github but the backdoors like the one abramz mentions DualECDBRG are not backdoors in the traditional code sense but in the cryptographic sense eg. the algorithms are very subtly tweaked to make them weaker instead of adding if key  xffffff return true or whatever in the middle of the code.I doubt too many people on the planet let alone on this subreddit are wellversed enough in cryptography to pick up such backdoors in something originally published by the Stanford Computer Security Lab.  in DualECDBRGs case recommended input values given by NIST in the standard seem to be fishy allowing someone who knows how they were generated to guess the random numbers generated after seeing only a little but of input. ,javascript,cex2bl6,4,t5_2qh30

439334,0,t1_cfq97u2,Added link belowStudy after study shows women simply do not gravitate towards these fields.I cant recall the study Swiss? but after  some years of attempted social engineering the results were obviousWhen women are bombarded with and sought after by STEM fields their numbers grow  for  years.  Then drops off again.  Then another program to recruit women results in?  You guessed it  years of interest.Women are simply not interested in these fields as a general rule.  Does that mean effort shouldnt be spent recruiting the best minds possible be they women or men?  Of course not.It does mean however that comments like yours are shortsighted and lacking an understanding while attempting to come off as the opposite.  Programs like this are more detrimental to society in my opinion  the longer we keep isolating people and alienating others in the name of equality absolutely regardless of any actual demand then were continuing to drive wedges in society.For that reason I would wish that programs like this are abandoned entirely.Not to mention if were actually convincing ourselves that were in touch with the female gender wouldnt it stand to reason that creating a cash incentive carries a certain connotation?  That women cant be bothered to educate themselves to better their position in the tech industry through an absolutely free course no less unless you dangle a few dollar bills in front of them?Nah people are just holding them back.EDIT For anyone inclined this series of videos is based on the study I mentioned above.  Also ignore the fact that umissnyankitty goes on to admit below that men and women are wired differently thats just anecdotal evidence to prove her point that were identical in biological makeup and disposition and society is responsible for gender roles... s,javascript,cfqavon,27,t5_2qh30

775702,0,t3_231cs9,There is no good answer to your question.  I have found that the field is too diverse now and to have a full understanding of the field you need roughly  years experience or PhD equivalent education dedicated to the field.  I know this sounds completely absurd but there are a couple of reasons for it.The best thing you can do is to get to know the company your prospective team and your interviewers.  I know this is hard but do it anyways.  Find out if there are certain technologies or tools they favor.  Discover if they are an Agile shop or what their planning schemes look like.  Discover if there are patterns or frameworks they favor.  You will have to talk to people to discover what best to study in advance.Personally I have been doing this a while and so I no longer care what is important to the interviewer.  I am an experienced technician and either I am a good fit or not.  For instance if a team is dedicated to using jQuery UI for absolutely everything because they are Java developers who fear the DOM and I were a vanilla JavaScript fanatic I would gladly fail out of the interview.  Experienced developers are so desperately in demand that if I fail to fit the culture of one team there are several more on standby waiting to interview me.  The demand is crazy high and I dont even live in the bay area or anything like it.If you REALLY want to look prepared extremely unnecessarily pump your confidence then go the extra  miles by studying these concepts and knowing them well accessibility semantics security privacy MVC test driven development QA automation algorithms parsing strategies data transmissionencapsulation data analysis data service integration mashups XML Schema markup language design namespaces and translations all the latest and greatest of HTML  even though nobody is using it yet vanilla JavaScript JavaScript design patterns OOP in JavaScript lexical scope closures in JavaScript without any OOP native DOM jQuery presentation CSS node.js grunt npmbower gitsvn AngularEmberBackboneDojo you can just pick one and be just fine progressive enhancement vs graceful degradationKeep in mind that mastering all these topics will allow you to cover most though not all the topics that could arise in your interview.

1128736,0,t1_chwkzbj,I didnt say that you should use prototypes because they are fast. In my original comment I said If he doesnt care about execution speed thats fine. But pretending that its faster is majorly misleading.. If using module patterns is the right abstraction for your code then by all means do it. Im not solving every problem with prototypes either. But you shouldnt not use prototypes because of the myth that they are slow.The optimizer should optimize common patterns sure. But if the optimizer can more easily grok the structure of your code that often implies that tooling can more easily understand what you are trying to do. And most importantly the next guy reading your code.Aside Crockford seems to have the unhealthy habit of saying things along the lines of I didnt test this  but it should be faster!. And this is one example where he was using JS semantics to reason about runtime speed. Which fortunately is pretty far from how JS is actually executed in reality. I just wanted to prevent people from thinking that just because Crockford said it its correct. Using a structuretype definition in line with the upcoming ES semantics shouldnt be shunned just because of misconceptions about how JS engines work.,javascript,chwlbur,6,t5_2qh30

1534905,0,t1_cj8o1ua,gt I know the implementation is different but from the end point of call function from a class it works.I think youre confusing the concept of object with the concept of class. Youre not calling a method of the class in JavaScript rather youre calling a method of an object.There are some languages that actually allow one to call methods on the class for example C. Theyre called static functions.Class is simply used to define a.. class of objects. You can think of it as a type definition. Using it one can create new objects of this type. Classes by themselves are not that useful but once you add inheritance youll start to get the true benefits of objectoriented programming with classes.Prototypes are just a different solution for providing inheritance in an objectoriented programming language.One could also in principle construct an objectoriented programming language without inheritance but I cant recall off the top of my head any examples.,javascript,cj8octu,1,t5_2qh30

1580175,0,t1_cjecfg4,I guess Im being very pedantic... But I would say the property you speak of is tracking changes not immutability. An alternate way to do it would be to have a single mutable collection that lets you perform all the push etc. methods but just sets a dirty flag to true and lets you call map.isClean method instead of comparing map  map and in the false case youd reset the dirty flag for next iteration. Obviously this solution doesnt scale well with multiple subscribers to the state but I hope it explains why I dont really attribute the optimization to immutability alone.Edit Just to be clear in case it didnt seem like it from my first comment I truly do believe immutability helps you write better and more foolproof code. But the way the article was written seemed to imply youd get a performance boost from simply using this on your JSON with no other changes. This is simply not true you need to write your code around immutability from the ground up before you can actually benefit from the principles it comes with.,javascript,cjecrbc,3,t5_2qh30

1729887,0,t1_cjx255h,There are a few very specific things that we suffered under Backbone While I originally loved the models and collections the sync portion was useless because we dont have a RESTful API and it was much easier to write our own I eventually grew to dislike the models and collections as well.  The most frequent performance problems were from the sheer volume of events that would get triggered on model changes especially when related models caused cascading updates to views or other models The problem with collections were especially egregious theres an inherent cyclic reference between a model and the collection that it gets put into.  This means that model can really only belong to one collection if for example you wanted to create a collection that represents a filtered set from a master collection youre out of luck the best you can do is get an array of filtered data and lose all of the nice builtin methods as well as your custom methods To get around the fact that Angular does not provide models or collections we wrote a very simple model concept they should have no methods except to and from json and a set of collection type classes loosely based on Backbones.  They dont trigger events a model triggering an event collection was BBs reason for the cyclic relationshiop BUT with Angulars dirtywatching that wasnt a problem.In the end our model layer is much cleaner we dont have to worry about zombie views we get free dependency injection for unit testing and we cut down the size of our code base by a pretty decent chunk.There are some things that I liked about Backbone dont get me wrong.  It was even my framework of choice for quite awhile. Having shaken off the this looks like obtrusive javascript impression and getting over the learning curve was probably one of the best decisions that Ive made for the project and its gotten me to think about how I write JS a bit differently as well.,javascript,cjx7tls,2,t5_2qh30

2220162,0,t3_2kjolg,Id go for method  though Id write the functions differently ex. currying a function that can return undefined is not a good idea. Im talking about the overall approach here.My reasoning and some of this is subjective I know If this isnt being called hundreds of times a second then performance takes a backseat to readability maintainability and reusability. Ill gladly sacrifice a few cycles per second to improve any of those things. Of course none of those are mutually exclusive you can rewrite the code in Method  to be a lot faster than whats written in the OP without losing any readability. Each function is short has a descriptive name and is easy to understand at a glance. When youre working alone maybe this isnt so important but when youre working on code with  other people contributing it makes the whole process much easier. See Clean Code You can easily reuse parts of the algorithm in Method  eg. isShortMessage could be part of an if statement somewhere. The other  methods solve one problem and one problem only. If you suddenly find you need a function like isShortMessage somewhere youre either left duplicating code or rewriting those functions to make them more generic.  Method  is easier to debug. This is a pretty minor point and its somewhat nullified by the function currying at the end but its something to think about. ,javascript,clm1anb,1,t5_2qh30

Provides a duplex connection whereby the server can push events without any voodoo or hacks.Socket.io is probably the most commonly used server for achieving this.Theres also sockjs which operates at a lower level compared to socket.io.Finally theres primus which provides an abstraction library so that you can swap out the underlying websocket socket.io sockjs etc implementation as you desire.,javascript,clv4qjc,2,t5_2qh30

You can read through and likely understand the source code in one afternoon.Why React?This one is more tricky to explain so Ill leave it up to  However I will tell you that I started writing a bunch of view code in react about  months ago and Ive been very happy with it so far. Ive writted entire apps and small widgets in React. Im not exactly sure why but for some reason my React code tends to be more reusable and easier to debug and refactor.I would also say stay away from big frameworks Angular in particular in the beginning.

2838887,0,t3_2slyxb,Think of every function as taking one more argument so instead of    function addx y         return x  y        You would have    function addself x y       return x  y        Note that we do nothing with self but it is there so when we call the function we have to pass it first. Since we dont need it we can just pass null    addnull        Now imagine you have to do this every time you want to call a function with no self it would be convenient if by default self is already setup for you and you can change it when you call the function if you so desire    add   addnull      At this point we should make self hidden so it is not part of the function arguments. We can write the function normally like function addx y and make a special keyword named this that will refer to the hidden argument within the function. By default this will be the global object or undefined in strict mode.    In some cases however it would be really useful to make this something by default other than the global object. For example we can say that whenever the function call is preceded by a dot like obj.add then this inside the function will refer to obj.    var obj        add functionx y         console.logthis x  y                   It logs the object because we used a dot    obj.add   obj     Notice that this rule is very loose there are no other constraints this is dynamic and depends only on how you call the function. In other words the caller is who decides what this is. If you were to assign the function to a variable then you get rid of the dot and this will no longer point to the object but to its default value the global object    var add  obj.add     add   window     Now that you understand how implicit this works you need to know how to make it explicit. For that we have call apply and bind       this inside add is set to obj explicitly    obj.add.callobj    obj        same as call but you pass an array of arguments    obj.add.applyobj    obj        bind creates a new function where this is bound permanently    obj.add.bindobj   obj   ,javascript,cnqs0ay,1,t5_2qh30

I decided to simply not use anything and built everything myself. This taught me why one framework is better than the other as well as how they work. You really get to understand the problems these frameworks are trying to solve which makes it really easy to judge which one is useful and which one isnt.This very primitive approach has one huge benefit I started realising  of the tools are completely useless unless you are in a company and even then most projects dont require a  lines grunt script along with bower git node npm and the mean stack.

All they would need to do is say that ES is the blessed language if you want to use uncompiled code or you can use the typepnaclbytecode version.. and use whatever backend language you want.This also solves other problems ranging from protecting source code to optimization of the bytecode before shipping to boost responsiveness and performance.,javascript,cqm0u0b,1,t5_2qh30

3960639,0,t3_35tslc,Closures in javascript allow a function to use variables from outside its immediate scope. Like many JS features closures can be powerful but they can also be dangerous.The first example that comes to mind for using closure is in higherorder functions functions which return functions.     function adderx       return function addToXy          the addToX closure has access to         the x variable even though it belongs to         the adder scope.        return x  y                  var addToFive  adder    addToFive  In this type of scenario closures allow us to create functions which configure other functions. Functional Javascript by Michael Fogus is a great book on this subject and talks in length about the role of closures in functional programming.On the other hand closures can be dangerous when used without intentionality. Passing around functions in JS is so simple thats its easy to lose track of your scope.You might start out with something simple like this    class Person       constructorfirstName lastName         var fullName  firstName lastName.join                 this.onaskForName  gt            This callback has access to the fullName           variables which is outside of its immediate scope          this.replyMy name is   firstName                  But as the Person class gets more complicated you may want to refactor out the askForName callback    class Person       answerWithName          Oops! firstName is undefined.        this.replyMy name is   firstName          It may seem clear in this example what went wrong but as your code gets more complicated it can be really easy to lose track of scope. Having access to variables outside of your function scope makes it easier to write code that puts you in this situation.EDIT Mozilla has a nice writeup on closures for anyone thats new to the concept.,javascript,cr7qvjs,6,t5_2qh30

4034393,0,t1_crfqi2d,gt Or did you just name that parameter function callback and in reality its just the computer waiting for a return before it reads the next line?Yes! Exactly! Try going to the fiddle and rename callback to cb another often used convenient name. Remember to rename it both places. It will work the same way. To illustrate you could also do this    function moveTiles         functionWithSetTimeOutrunAfterTimeout        function runAfterTimeoutmessageFromCallback         console.logmessageFromCallback  Done! Increase counter!        counter        console.logCounter increased!    Get it? I just call functionWithSetTimeOut with another function as a parameter just like had it been a number or a string. As you can see runAfterTimeout expects to be called with the parameter messageFromCallback. This is what we do in the line    return callbackDone! Increase counter!callback is actually just a variable that holds the function  runAfterTimeout so when we write the above line it actually just means    return runAfterTimeoutDone! Increase counter!And you could actually call it that way but it would be impractical if you needed the function functionWithSetTimeOut to return another function than runAfterTimeout at some point. Using the variable callback is just a handy way for us to always be able to define which function should be run afterwards.I hope it makes sense. ,javascript,crg5grr,1,t5_2qh30

I will give you a couple of recommendations for each.  Mentors....Maybe some will... but all of the best mentors Ive met wont do something  for free... you are there to be their slave labor. The reality is that they will take less out of the deal than you will but they will at least get something in exchange. So find someone that you can proposition like thisgt I will help you with your project paperwork random shit any of the things you care about infinitely more than any person in existence but just please show me the beautiful world of programming in exchange.... Most people are sympathetic to that cause... and you will be once you get there and someone asks you to be sympathetic to them. Small problemssmall problems are anything and everything. How can you programmatically breakdown the space that you live in get a big list of beer and break down what the best deals are based on APV and your personal taste preferences access your grocery shopping list after iterating through what you want to eat coming up.... literally anything that you can do to break it down with programming.

You can be semantic about it all you want and you will continue to accomplish nothing. Just because a language doesnt implement classes exactly like Java does implementation details and all doesnt mean that language lacks classes.Imagine a language say  had only goto for control flow and later added if and else as sugar on top. You could argue with your colleagues and say that  if statements are really just sugar over goto and you would be technically correct.

4364609,0,t1_cshlg31,Id say your perception is off the mark. Allow me have a bit of a rant. Whilst I saw a handful of bloggers complain about the fact that constructors have side effects if called without new last year Ive never seen any prejudice against constructors in my professional experience. Just because Eric Elliot or whoever promotes their personal idiom as the One True Way doesnt make them a canonical source or reflect how most experienced web developers actually write JavaScript. And what happens when the selfappointed experts disagree? Douglas Crockford is happy to use constructors and regards ES classes with suspicion and from what I hear many parts of ES more generally. Does he trump someone writing in Smashing Magazine about how extends has solved the collective ache of the entire web dev community? Sooner or later youre going to have to make your own decisions.It seems to me that you should worry less about what selfappointed experts propose and make your own judgements about the patterns on the table. For instance some sources put there will tell you that in order to write idiomatic JavaScript you must only ever use prototypes for inheritance even though that means you cannot inherit from objects that have private state lest you share unwanted state between instances or jump through various hoops to achieve what constructor closures gave us from day one  or abandon privacy entirely. Do you think object orientation makes much sense without private state? I dont so I dont use delegates. I may read about different approaches but ultimately its my responsibility as a developer to reason about my preferred style based on my priorities as a programmer.Anyway ranting over.

At  all microservices function independently of each other and are fully functional if other services go down. All source code changes are automatically tracked via git. The only way one services status could affect the other is if they are piped together as a composite service. The composite would fail because one of its components would be offline.As for breaking changes and versioning the interface for all microservices described here is functionreq res where req and res are HTTP request and response streams.

This will give you option to reuse logic without having code duplication. Look into unobtrusive JavaScript. Error handling when working with numbers is a must. I know this piece isnt very complex but dont get into the habit of not making assumptions when working with JavaScript at any given time a variable can change types or become undefined. I also check my variables for type and not being null or undefined. This will give you a much cleaner and more maintainable piece of code for years to come. Youre on the right track. The break isnt really necessary and I would have used a for loop. Just my preference when working in loops. forvar x   x lt  x logic  Maybe look into switch statements as they are sometimes a cleaner way to check a single variable against multiple outcomes or ifelse if else. Try to limit the amount of work your code has to do to reach the final output. Meaning if its greater than  it doesnt need to check its going to be the same as the random number.

Mithril doesnt really enforce anything but it encourages good practices for structuring applications that will pay dividends later on. For example in Mithril all components are structured in a nested MVC hierarchy which makes tracing the flow of data and reasoning about the code base very easy whereas using vanilla javascript this could quickly devolve into spaghetti code mess. It also provides some basic abstractions like a virtual dom and diffing algorithm optimized in a raf loop and redrawing the dom only when needed. Of course this could all be done using vanilla javascript... but its just more work. Its like using smaller lego blocks when some larger well built well tested and well maintained block already exists for those purposes.

Even their example on github server only uses http and doesnt mention that.  Second it probably should not encourage putting the JWT into the cookie to be sent back and forth between the server and the API.  It would be better to only keep the bearer token where it belongs and thats with the Authorization Header.  Then force the web clients to store the token securely client side if they must in local storage and pull it out into memory for use to send over.If one must use cookies theres better options such as expressJS sessions which use a SID in the cookie and keeps the session information on the server rather than using cookies to continuously send the JWT again and again.  I find it wincing to see any data other than a session sid sent over the wire these days with a cookie.  The article should also mention if using cookies to set the HttpOnly and secure flags so that the cookie cant be hijacked with XSS javascript and also again only be used with    The article also doesnt talk about where to get the JWT and important aspects of the contents of the JWT and how it can be signed with either a shared secret or a pubpriv key.  It should have at least talked a little bit about the audience flags relationship to the confused deputy as well as the expiration of the token in relation to the user having to relogin again or revalidate through a rolling token system.I understand some of these recent JWT articles are trying to be the Hey look at me Im Mr. Security Meeseeks but theyre missing a lot of links and other important informational security thoughts that are required to secure sites if the owners decide to use JWT.  This might mislead a lot of people into thinking that just any ole JWT token thrown onto their stack is a magic security panacea when it really is not and might be worse than them setting their plain old cookie auth they originally had.        ,javascript,cvhtnab,5,t5_2qh30

5379023,0,t3_3oomj1,Sure you could probably argue that you could always create a parent class that would encapsulate any common features you would need but then you would be forced to recreate the hierarchy in classical inheritance.  Prototypical inheritance doesnt  really care about that.  You can bindcallapply the this of whatever method to another object and use that in the context of another object.  This makes prototypical inheritance very flexible.  Overall your inheritance tree becomes less deep and a more wide with prototypical inheritance because you can haphazardly inherit random objects.  EDIT  when thinking of prototypes think class interfaces except the methods are already defined and the context is whatever is using the interface.In a more classical approach youre methods become tightly bound to the type of class youve built.  With JS you can pass in any object as a parameter while in more classical languages you need to make sure your object is defined as a certain type before being able to pass it through.  Yes I know generics and all that alleviate this but that is just a workaround to a problem that shouldnt really exist.  Why should objects be typed in the first place?You could always recreate classical inheritance from prototypical inheritance if you truly wanted to.  You cant do the opposite very easily. Also with JS I dont see too much inheritance to begin with other than React components and scope in Angular.  In reality many things can be done in a functional manner and thats where I think JS really shines.  Well designed higher order functions removes the need to set up so many objects.

When you make a lookup on an array it converts the key to a string and uses that like it would for other object keys.    var a      console.loga      console.loga      var b  a     console.logba      a.foo    the array object a now has a new key foo    console.loga      console.loga.foo      console.logafoo      console.loga.length      a    this creates a hole in the array where a and a havent been created and there arent any keys for the values in the array object,javascript,cwlwase,1,t5_2qh30

5969597,0,t3_3x69c1,First off lets try and specify things clearly.  Your app has a state S and you are applying a series of actions A through to An such that the state Sn is the result of applying An to Sn.So for a simple app that doesnt need to interact with external systems you could simply store each state and a user can undo or redo by replacing the current state with some previous saved state.  If your state is very large and complex this may be impractical either do to the amount of memory used or to the slowness of serializing and deserializing the state.A further problem arises when you want to talk to an external system ie to persist something to a database.  Possible solutions. If your app is very small you could simply serialize the entire state and send that.  So user performs A and A so you send S and S to the server.  User hits undo so you resend S.. This will not scale.  So the next solution is to implement your entire stateactionundo system twice once on either end of the network link and just send actions back and forth.  So user performs A and A you send A and A and the server applies them to its existing state to hopefully! get S and S.  Then when the user clicks undo you send an undo event and the server reverts back to its stored S which hopefully! matches yours.  Sync issues will be an issue plus this is still slow and resource heavy.. So the next interation if you can pull it off would be to formulate every action An with its inverse An such that applying An to a state Sn will return you to state Sn.  So if a users A action is to set the name on a contact record which was originally Bob to Robert then the A action is to set the name back to Bob.  Now you dont store states you store As and you can send those across the wire.  User performs A and A you send A and A to the server which stores them.  User hits undo and you pop A off the stack and perform it.If you think about it youll notice that this last option requires the least about of serialization and deserialization the lowest memory usage and the least network traffic.  Its still prone to sync issues but you can issue checkpoint updates and if you ever detect a sync issue just do a full resync from whichever side you trust more the server or client.  On the other hand its probably the hardest to implement.  And some corner cases may be very hard to deal with.  For example the inverse of deleting a  gig file is creating a  gig file which means naively your action would be  gig.

6161761,0,t1_cypyy0o,ok got it. Personally I think jumping through so many hoops to implement privacy is probably much more trouble and performance sapping than its worth. What real problems are you guarding against with slightly stronger privacy than with privacybyconvention?Id just use underscoredandprefixed ie pigprop or Symbolkeyed properties. Then you avoid the cacheunfriendly indirection of the extra object and if you initialize the values in the constructor the VM can more easily guess the shape of the object and allocate a slot for the property.    const CowOwner  base gt class extends base       constructor...args         superargs...        this.cowOwnercows                  getAnimals         const cows  this.cowOwnercows        if super.getAnimals          return super.getAnimals  cows                return cows                  addCow         this.cows                  const PigOwner  base gt class extends base       constructor...args         superargs...        this.pigOwnerpigs                  getAnimals         const pigs  this.pigOwnerpigs        if super.getAnimals          return super.getAnimals  pigs                return pigs              addPig         this.pigs                  const Person  base gt class extends base       constructor...args         superargs...        this.name  null        this.age  null                      class Farmer extends mix.withPerson CowOwner PigOwner is a lot less code and much easier for the VM to analyze. Since the VM can see the property initializers in the constructors itll allocate slots for all four properties so they will be fast as opposed to being allocate the in property map which is slow. The downside is that privacy isnt strictly enforced but it really wasnt in your code either it was just more of a pain to get to. Whos going to be modifying the objects anyway? If you have a true security need for privacy then the values should be stored in a closure.Im an exJava guy so I used to think not having privacy was crazy but these days I think its a bit overrated and especially not worth adding much complexity for.,javascript,cyq11qf,1,t5_2qh30

6190103,0,t3_40by0z,The Nylas N email client is an example of a JavaScript frontend with a Python backend. But in that case the Python part runs on a server.If you use Electron to build your frontend as N does you could alternatively spawn a Python subprocess from the JavaScript code to run everything locally and to get the benefits of Electrons ability to produce easilyinstalled artifacts.To combine JavaScript and C or C in one app use Node Addons to call into shared objects from an Electron app or other app implemented with Node.EditYou mentioned that Electron is taking a long time to install. I find that the easiest way to develop with Electron is to structure your app as a NodeJS project with a package.json file using npm to install dependencies and to include electronprebuilt as a dependency in your app. electronprebuilt comes with an executable that is used to actually run the app located in the project hierarchy at nodemodules.binelectron,javascript,cyt8zxa,2,t5_2qh30
6195445,0,t3_40ef75,As coming from PHP world I actually LOVE the simplificity of project initial configuration in Node compared to PHP or Java world.Typically a PHP project is written in this way so you must to download repository install composer modules install all php modules that this project uses like phpmcrypt phpgd and a lot of times you will learn this once your app will fire  error you must dig around config files that sometimes may be really huge like  config files in laravel or symfony at start?. you must create correct directories make sure you have correct access rights. you must figure out if this project has migrations and a lot of them doesnt have   if not you must dig a databse and make schema dump from prod server. and this is just starting because after that you must dig into apachenginx or whatever server you use and configure directories vhosts etc.java ee is just even more overkill to configure and everyone knows why.a node.js was a bit of fresh air for me. ive developed a project few months ago that was stalled by my boss to be resumed after few months. few days ago he decided to resume it while I have had my disk format recently.So I just pulled our HG repository went to dir looked at dir for certain pointsa config.webpack.js lt so we are using webpack hereb .configdistdatabase.json  .configdistapp.json  ... lt so we have template config directory okayc package.json lt so we are using npm dependenciesd index.js in root dir lt so this is entry point of directory.so Ive typed in terminal npm install ampamp npm install g webpack and went to make some good coffee in meantime.after I came back I just copied files from .configdist over to .config  opened it and looked that default values from json files were OK for development. so I just left them as they were here.finally I just typed webpack watch to compile client side things and started nodemon index.js to run my app. console outputted that my app is listening at  so I went just there aaaaand its done! mongodb is schemaless so I ddidnt even have to dig with migrationsschema things.installing this on prod server was just same steps just messing a bit in config values and it took like  minutes of my activity to setup.,javascript,cytuu9i,4,t5_2qh30

You pass the bound crazyUpdate action creator to the component and fire it onClick. Using thunk we can fire these actions asynchronously and your component remains ignorant to the structure of your application.This way your component fires a single action which seems more in line with singleresponsibility and dumb component philosophy actions arent duplicated across reducers even though there is a case for this and reducers only receive properties used to update the state,javascript,cyvot8f,1,t5_2qh30

6238610,0,t1_cyyo8na,Let me preface this by saying jquery is awesome and used to be really useful. I got nothing against it. I just havent used it professionally in years and dont see why Id ever go back.Your response touches on a lot of things. Im going to try to respond to it point by point.gtThe DOM is still a steaming pile of garbage it just completed some missing features bizarrely recently! and made it more crossbrowsercompatible except older IE which was the main issue to begin with.Im not sure how you came to this conclusion but as a front end developer who writes a shit ton of javascript and interacts with the DOM ceaselessly the DOM is really pretty simple and the API is pretty great when youre not on ltIE. And lt IE isnt even supported by jquery .x anymore.gtThe AJAX parts are obviousThere are better alternatives for AJAX that dont require a monolithic library.gtbut my favorites are actually the event triggering system.Same thing here. If I want an event library Ill grab one off npm I dont need jquery for that.gtAnd honestly even the simple DOM manipulation and traversal looks all over the place.What? Need to get an element? One method and youre done document.querySelector. Manipulation? Theres plenty of standardized methods appendChild style textContent etc. As for traversal...you know honestly I cant remember the last time I actually needed to manually traverse the DOM. But you should be fine element.parentNode element.children etc.gtOf course if React does all of the DOM manipulation and event handling and you dont use AJAX those arguments arent really relevant. And I suspect that this is the case here.Again Ive been using React daily at my day job for probably a bit over a year now and React doesnt do anything except render really well. Thats the beauty of it. Its a targeted library it does one thing render and update the DOM and it does it well. This is as opposed to jquery which is this massive toolbox that most of the time you need maybe  of it at all.tldr Ive been writing javascript targeted at browsers up and including IE for like  years now and havent touched jquery in any of that time.,javascript,cyyrgo4,7,t5_2qh30

If you hire additional developers theyd have to learn your code base and there would be  help on stack overvlow for them. Youd have to write extensive documentation if you want others to be able to help maintain your  off app.. Cross Browser Compatibility  Youd have to rewrite all sorts of helper functions to maintain cross browser compatibility especially if you need to support lower versions of IE.. Youd be wasting a lot of time reinventing the wheel  When working on a project the first thing you should be doing is seeing what out of the box solutions are available and if they meet the criteria for your project. While theres some initial time dump in researching the solutions and familiarizing yourself with them in the long run youll be in a better spot where you can be much more productive and focus on implementing the business needs instead of reinventing a framework so you can do anything.I agree with what your statement about writing a lot of boilerplate or basically reinventing the wheel and it would be a large waste of effort to keep it up.

Meanwhile this is exactly what you do with some javascript compilers.Even if you start including F you still dont need to configure the compiler. VS is smart enough that when you add F files itll just hook everything up for you. And typescript too! Hell if you install some plugins you can do that for things like LESS coffeescript and SCSS as well.Compare that to webpack. Every single file type needs very tedious and errorprone module loader setup.

6624243,0,t1_d04eqps,Its both.  But the term proxy also isnt meant to mean Proxy as the implementation rather a proxy in theory.  Promises wrap operations that resolve into values into a single object with a consistent interface.  Whether the operation has completed and a value is available or not the Promise behaves the same way.  You say promise.thendoSomething and doSomething will always get executed some time in the future when the value getting resolved is available.  Even when the value is available its not returned right away and you still have to wait for it just like youre waiting for the operation getting that value needs to complete though the timing will likely be a lot shorter.The whole proxy concept really only goes so far.  You cant truly treat promises as you would your actual value other than it being a reference that you can pass around.  Generally with promises you tend to wait for your value once you get ahold of that promise so you can use the value normally.,javascript,d04i526,8,t5_2qh30

6889509,0,t1_d0x4418,The key is to understanding what variables are actually storing. In most languages you have the primitive types which are generally integers floats and booleans usually a couple more. You also have a reference type which is a bit like a pointer if youve done C or C. If not its exactly what it sounds like it points to some place in memory where an object is stored.When you pass around values you pass around one of these things whether it is a primitive or a reference. You can think of a reference as just a number which is pretty much the memory address of the object so like  or .When you pass primitives to functions it makes a copy leaving the original as it is. So    var a          function somethingarg         arg          somethinga    a    true.The same thing happens for references. It copies the number of the memory address it does not copy the object it points to. So if your reference was to an object name joe but the reference itself is a number like  the number gets copied and given to the function.    var someObject  name joe    function addSurnameobj         obj.surname  smith        addSurnamesomeObject    console.logsomeObject  name joe surname smithWhen we do .surname were saying that object at memory address ... add a surname key to it.Now if you create a brand new object inside this addSurname function youre going to get given a referencenumber to store in a variable. So say at the start obj has the address . We create a new object which is at the address . We can change obj to point to . But this doesnt change someObject that will continue to point to .Disclaimer I dont know the internal way JavaScript does this but the analogy holds well and its approximately how it is done in languages like C.,javascript,d0x8rjp,3,t5_2qh30

6966636,0,t3_4b4826,What youve encountered is a reentrant binding loop. These can be somewhat common as your application scales.You can trace the loop using the call stack. If youre using Chrome DevTools tick the Async checkbox. That will include the async MutationObserver frames in your call stack allowing you to look all the way back to the beginning.Worth noting that this is the problem that unidirectional data flow architectures such as Flux attempt to address and why most of the current crop of frontend frameworks eschew twoway databinding.I think that you should prevent this by architecting your way out. Whatever component is responsible for these mutations should be aware that it also mutates the IMG tags and should perhaps maintain a piece of state that indicates to itself that its responsible for a particular change allow it to prevent infinite recursion by only calling fixImage if it is actually required.,javascript,d1605ip,6,t5_2qh30

This will be removed in  for consistency. Source There are other deprecations happening too so take a look.This absolutely destroys our app as our major selling point is its offline capability. Were not happy about it.Based on this timeframe We have to get EVERY SINGLE CLIENT on SSL by midjuly and every single one of their web client users has to reload the app on the secure origin well use an IIS redirect to send them there but theyll lose any clientside database data from the nonssl origin.

7470246,0,t3_4ho9n5,I plop this out whenever someone asks about framework choice.Javascript frameworks tend to be in one of three camps  . Kitchen Sink    These are opinionated and have an idea about how you should do things from AZ. Their opinions tend to cover how you should organize your app how you should write your files etc.    Meteor    Angular    Ember    DoneJs    Aurelia  . Batteries included     These have less opinions about how you should structure things and tend to be much smaller overall. Youll make more architecture decisions but there will still be some ideas provided. Youll typically still have things like a router here.     Mithril     Riot     Knockback     CanJs  . BYOA bring your own architecture     These do one thing and only one thing. Typically thats the V part of MVC. The rest is up to you from routing to validation etc.     React     Vue     Rivets     Polymer     Knockout     BackboneWhat you choose depends on your familiarity with JS how comfortable you are making architectural decisions etc. Groups in  and  require you to make more decisions but you end up being less tied to the framework as a result. I would advise trying a few tutorials or doing a few  minute projects to see what you like. As with so much in JS there isnt really an easy decision here and theres a lot of nuance to each of them  they all appeal to different groups of people for different reasons.,javascript,d2rbl67,66,t5_2qh30

7556039,0,t1_d30q8by,I think theres a huge stretch between fetishising and beauty. I also think things can be beautiful without hanging on my wall. That something be appropriate for a photograph is not a requirement for beauty.Michaelangelos sculptures and fresco paintings are often said to be beautiful. But I dont really want them in my living room. And taking a picture of them doesnt capture the same thing. Theres a physical element to the beauty.Nor do I think labelling things I think are beautiful diminishes anything else.Beauty is about pleasure and satisfaction not visual appeal. Its an emotional response but not necessarily driven by a visual precursor. We have a phrase for the other one by the way good looking.Theres fairly widespread agreement that there can be a concept of beauty in maths Proofs are often labelled as elegant a key component in beauty. I dont think its unreasonable to extend it to computer science or to computing. There are certainly different solutions to a problem some of which may be judged more elegant.Ultimately beauty is a word. Now you may attach a meaning to that word beyond the definition but that is your meaning and not necessarily common to everyone  though communication demands we share some common understanding of the word to exchange knowledge it does not demand that we believe exactly the same thing.As for the argument about it being a tool I feel like that is you trying to grind something down into small pieces to argue it away. A sunrise is little more than the after effects of a massive explosion a long way off. Something can be collectively beautiful without it being ascribed to any individual component.,javascript,d313317,2,t5_2qh30

The XML spec says either single or double quotes are fine       AttValue       ltamp | Reference       |   ltamp | Reference And XHTML is supposed to be valid HTML.  The XHTML spec doesnt specifically mention singlequotes vs doublequotes but does list the differences between XHTML and HTML and while it mentions that XHTML requires quotes it state specific ones are required.  It even has single quotes in an example where XHTML is mixed in with HTML    ltp xmlns          This is also available lta href      ltpgtIts quite likely that youve run into a style guide or style enforcement program that forbade single quotes but the spec allows them and generic user agents that arent requiring a specific style should too.,javascript,d3ueli7,1,t5_2qh30
7816329,0,t1_d3ul1me,Thanks for the reply!gt Why should I use an ORM?An ORM in this project merely means two things . Data we receivesend to RESTful services isnt always in the formatdata type we want to have in our JS. . You can define relationships like A user has many posts. With this definition you can say many things    when I save the user  save the posts   when I add a post to the user.posts collection  add the foreign key and save the post   store the posts directly on the user object  as you save posts  update the user record how to work with relational data in nonrelational backends like documentstores   when I save a post and the user is not yet saved  wait until the user has finished saving in order to avoid foreign key errors on the RESTful backendIll add that to the FAQ on the websiteREADME rewrite the answer some based on your feedback if you can.Rekord was developed with the idea in mind that we should steer away from the fill out a form  hit save  watch progress bar  ok it saved and more into an optimistic approach in order to make a users interaction with an application more responsive. Rekord has events which communicate when there are problems with saving a record youre offline the record still has unsaved changes the record is pending a save or removal. Ideally all of these possible states should be seamlessly communicated to the user through the UI. Maybe a yellow hint if the user is offline and a record isnt saved to the RESTful service  maybe a slight disabled look if the record is actively saving etc. These are only cases where something might be wrong  but since Rekord is aiming for offline amp realtime applications it would be good to nicely communicate to the user the status of their actions.Thanks for your input  I definitely plan on making the Lists example an application you can use online or download for your phone maybe without a backend  havent figured out a cost effective way of doing that yet,javascript,d3umbt8,1,t5_2qh30

8071287,0,t1_d4mukrk,Im going to have to take a look at React but strictly better seems a very bold statement.  My impression and I could be wrong its only what I read is that React is largely a library for handling page rendering whereas Angular is a complete framework for clientside development. By being minimal React seems to give developers a lot of choices about how to implement much of their app. Angular  looks to be much more opinionated about how things should be built. To me theres fairly clear pros and cons of both choices  its great having and being expected to have loads of flexibility but all of those choices take time. And its fairly likely that in most cases the designers of a framework like Angular are in a better position to make those choices  than my developers are.My point isnt that Angular is better  Ive not used React so I dont know.

If you already have a good foundation then a starting with a framework is probably a good idea. Id look at Todo MVC to help you evaluate some. But if you are starting at  or close to it then I think a frame work is the wrong way to go. Frame works have a lot going on obviously and can be very overwhelming. You will need to do a lot of very specific reading before you get up and running. If you just start building it thing out simply. With just some jquery for dom manipulation then you will be able to get someting on screen and running much more quickly.

8685920,0,t1_d6rbkkj,gt Also many frameworks are written by extremely experienced people and harp on best practices. I dont really agree with this in the JS ecosystem. Angular React and Ember are all very different architectures that accomplish the same thing in very different ways. If you declare Angulars approachdesignarchitecturestyle as best practice then by definition React cannot be best practice and viceverse.As such if you take to learning JS using Angular as your reference point you just end up learning Angularstyle JS not necessarily fundamental best practices.gt Learning core Ruby was pretty much a waste of timeMy experience was the opposite with learning Laravel. I had a severe case of NIH which ironically ended up serving me well at the time. I forced myself to learn not just OOP but also how to build common architectural tools like IoC containers routers an active record ORM etc. This exposed me to the underlying complexities behind these toolsconcepts and how you use programming fundamentals to solve them in maintainable testable ways. Only when I realized I was literally rebuilding what already existed and what already existed was more featurecomplete than what I was writing did I say Ok I get it now. Time to just use the framework. But because I had started from the ground up learning fundamental programming principles and applying those to build common architectural elements of a framework I had a much more thorough and complete understanding of frameworks in general and also how to properly augment what they give you out of the box or build what they dont.That fundamental background also made it MUCH easier to overcome all of the horrible limitations of things like WordPress.

You need to call load before play if you change the audio.src.The audio will keep loading past the end time until you stop playback as far as I know. Not sure how to get around that.An easier option is to just trim your audio files first outside of the browser if thats feasible. If you have a list of files and their startstop times you could write a script that uses something like ffmpeg to do it for you.

And for thats pretty irrelevant which edition you use.ES makes it easier for programmers of other languages to join in because it sounds more like traditional OOP languages.The only thing thats not that brilliant in ES right now is that you need at least a module loader or some sort of transpiler for the more interesting parts.As closing words go At least you teach them.

9613668,0,t3_5cnud4,Thats a Pyrrhic migration if Ive ever heard one. The main thing modern frameworks solve is the coordination of the DOM state with a separate model state. This significantly reduces the amount of code you need to write  IME. There are lots of widget libraries for the current set of frameworks. My experience with commercial support is that its a complete waste of money and probably the best reason to not use closed source software but commercial widget libraries almost universally offer support.Companies interested in long term code stability should look into Ember. You cant put the codebase on a shelf forever but having a clear migration path is one of the primary considerations by the maintainers and the process is open so you can ensure your needs are met if you spend time engaging with the community. Outside Ember going with a commercial widget library in any major framework is another reasonable option.The other reason to invest in a currentgen framework is stability. I believe were largely through the major disruptions in the JS language and DOM environment until wasm becomes a reasonable target  years out. Ive been doing serious js development since  and the history has been a continuous set of shocksparadigm changes  ajax  x perf increase  component model  vdom  ESweb components.

No digging in three structure or searching for the right file. When we remove a CSS class from the code we get a linter warning that the class in the CSS file is no longer being used. In production we generate classnames that is  char long hashes and almost no nesting which makes the css files really small while still able to have long telling classnames in development.I have to say that I could never go back to global CSS.

Think of it this way if I write a simple function that iterates over x values is it going to be much faster in C or JS node? Furthermore JS is compiled JIT compilation so Im not convinced that execution time will in general always be significantly quicker. It will depend on factors like bundle size.

So you gain a benefit of not having to reason about consuming an event but you lose out on the semantic side. That is you skip the event side of event sourcing.My opinion on this isnt that its a good state container but that its essentially an immutable stream tree.Why is this abstraction any better than connecting together a bunch of steam combiners? Like merging and combining RX streams? Conceptually this feels the same. ,javascript,dc5psh0,2,t5_2qh30

10257284,0,t3_5msilu,There are a number of reasons why people like myself have a strong dislike of jQuery though some of these reasons go back to much earlier versions.In short jQuery was at the beginning shitty.  I know folks are not going to want to hear this but there is no other word that can reliably be used.It tried to cover DOM differences without understanding the basic most basic and fundamental things about the DOM ... such as the difference between properties and attributes on DOM elements.The old attr method had a lot of internal switching to try to do the expected thing through the same interface and it led to a great deal of confusion because it would behave very differently in different contents.That has been finally fixed with the introduction of the prop method but nonetheless it showed a basic lack of understanding.In addition jQuery attempts to be more than simply a DOM manipulation tool but wants to provide other utility functions that are better served through specialized tools.  Extended array handling was better served by underscore or lodash for instance.  Now we code duplication and people using lodash or jquery methods depending on who wrote the code. As a multipurpose tool jQuery simply did too much and most of it  not terribly well.Add in jQuerys botched Promise implementation via deferred simply throws more fuel on the fire.jQuery also encouraged people to code without understanding the basic ideas of what is going on.  Event delegation for instance is often misunderstood.My last great dislike of jQuery comes from the culture  the culture itself encourages people with minimal knowledge and minimal skill to bodge things together.   Software development shouldnt be a bodge  it should be a skilled discipline.   It encouraged people to grab jQuery grab an assortment of plugins of unknown quality and slam things together on a page.The sheer fact that jQuery comes with a noConflict option so you can run OTHER VERSION OF JQUERY ON THE SAME PAGE is simply insane.In todays world There is simply no need for jQuery.   You never needed jQuery simply for the selectors  the sizzle engine that drove it was usable stand alone. querySelector and querySelectorAll are almost perfect crossbrowser replacements. Event handlers are clean now that we dont need IEs old method. Event delegation is simple and elegant. ajax handling is better done via fetch and using real promises. ... the list could go on.,javascript,dc6pwp0,11,t5_2qh30

10314395,0,t1_dccxg0s,Thanks for the response. I do think your example does do a good job of introducing map and filter. And I agree with some aspects of your code like pulling out and defining passable map and filter functions however I would personally not using arrow functions in this case as they cannot be named so youll get less readable stack traces. I would use arrow functions if I need the context not to change or if Im writing one directly in a function call where the passed function doesnt need is own context.Also I dont agree that Functions should do one thing and i have read the cleancode rules before I dont fully agree. Function calls have a significant cost so to me it seems unwise to go that far. Im well aware how to do functional programming I just choose not to use it all the time. In JavaScript its not one of those things where everything you write has to use it. Sadly this seems to be the trend people are trying to spread lately and Im actually quite pissed about it. The performance implications are often left unmentioned. You get people coming up with the Functions should do one thing rule which actually if you take it for what it says could simple mean it should have one consiquence. That could be the return value or concise mutation of some state that to me is actually an okay rule.,javascript,dcd6ykt,2,t5_2qh30

10819677,0,t1_ddvo8gq,I concur. Like countless critical apps written in Python. Or a ton of Ruby apps. There is no silver bullet here. The main cause of problems with software is in our processes to build it. Unit test your code and have integration test so you maintain contracts between your components and services. Keep your code simple. Dont build abstractions prematurely. Get your code reviewed. And with many mediocre developers in enterprise favour pairing and mentoring. That will do a lot more than the sugar coating of TS does.,javascript,ddvz1vp,2,t5_2qh30

10986404,0,t3_5wuj1e,I keep a mental list of what tools exist and what they do but I dont go learn them. If there are several tools in the same space e.g. HighCharts and D I do some quick research to find out the highlevel differences. If the need arises for one tool in a project then I do a quick trial miniproject to evaluate easeofuse and whether it fits my needs. This includes looking at the documentation and deciding against it if the docs arent up to snuff.My rule of thumb is one or two new tools per project maximum. So for example if the project is going to use ElasticSearch and the team never used it that counts as one new tool. Or if the client requires integrating to a rd party SaaS we never used that counts as one new tool. Its quite possible for there to be more than two new tools in a project but crossing that line comes with loud warnings about risk of severe code debt ahead.If the project is a boring cookie cutter CRUD then its allowable to try out Vue or RxJS or Falcor whatever but again the rule is one or two new techs maximum.This is for peripheral tools i.e. tools that may or may not be used from project to project. I also have a core set of tools that I try to master to the best of my abilities for me those are Mithril.js Express PostgreSQL Redis. YMMVReplacing a core tool requires an overwhelmingly strong argument. For example MySQL used to be my goto database but I learned PostgreSQL feature set is much more powerful. returning alone can save a ton of network requests in a typical app. Express replaced .NET MVC because thats what my current company uses. etc.Btw notice that I listed a lot of technologies that arent javascript per se. Full stack means being able to quickly evaluate and use a very wide range of technologies so when you have room to learn new tools then prefer one that will enlarge your toolset e.g. theres very little to gain from mastering Vue coming from React  since theres little to learn to begin with  if you compare to learning ElasticSearch or RabbitMQ or Twilio or Docker etc.Theres a third category of tools that I call nicetohave tools. Basically if a tool and its competitors didnt exist and you could still finish your project within your deadline then its a nicetohave. For me Babel is an example because I can write ES without whining. Maybe for you Babel is a hard requirement for team dynamics reasons but maybe HMR is nicetohave. Or browsersync or PostCSS or whatever. For a nicetohave tool I learn enough to get by if Im stuck with it in a legacy project but for new projects I dont generally bother with them at all since I usually end up picking another tool to fill my oneortwonewtools budget in boring projects.,javascript,ded9vk2,5,t5_2qh30

11052091,0,t1_deknqaa,interesting question.  I like it but maybe thats because its so common now and a competitor hasnt risen up to challenge it or take its place.  Before MD there was TinyMCE which I believe WordPress still uses.  As a frontend dev I would never be satisfied with the HTML markup that TinyMCE created but for nontech clients it was fine.  So yeah I guess MD is aimed at programmers.  I guess its nice not to have to deal with writing HTML markup for simple things like commenting in reddit and creating READMEs in Github.  Also it allows sites to use styling in comments without having to worry about stripping malicious code.  TinyMCE allowed you to switch between the HTML and the WYSIWYG so you were still needing to worry about dealing with that when sending it to the server.  I would imagine that was one of the biggest reasons it was created.  An interesting fact Markdown was cocreated by Aaron Swartz  I had no idea. ,javascript,dekqhil,1,t5_2qh30

Its still possible with some hassle older version or community maintained fork Babels doesnt work but youre using that as your main argument? gt its usable without a transpile step which IMO is crucial for beginnersThat doesnt matter any longer. Transpiling is part of what Javascript is. If a beginner chooses to disregard that the language itself is disregarded. Especially in the beginning the tools are more important than the language. But ill stop arguing here. As ive said JSX has proven its worth. The DSL is a small cost for what is the cleanest smallest and most performant way to define UI.

Do I not use them to break up a particularly long statement that could otherwise have been written in one line e.g absurdlyLongFunctionNameabsurdlyLongArgument absurdlyLongArgument  absurdlyLongArgument  ?

11641060,0,t1_dgfhjc8,gt Scalability as in having a code base that a developer can actually work on without going insane.I know what you meant.gt If I were to have done that imperatively I would now have  different imperatively declared data tables that all have to be maintained and updated manually.You are still misunderstanding the difference between declarative and imperative code.  Code reuse applies equally in both styles.  Some common and serious flawed assumptions many developers make is that imperative code means procedural code or that functional programming must be declarative.  Both are false.  Functional programming can be completely imperative which is absolutely not procedural.,javascript,dgfj06m,1,t5_2qh30

You can separate every kind of thing into separate files constants action creators reducers selectors etc or put everything into the same file.  You may also want to read through Dans article You Might Not Need Redux where he discusses some of the actual tradeoffs that Redux asks you to make.FWIW Im writing a blog post that clarifies what actual technical limitations Redux imposes and wherewhy they exist vs how you are encouraged to use Redux vs how its possible to use Redux.

11740564,0,t3_67gvic,Honestly even the slightest bit of crosscomponent communication becomes easier to reason about when you use redux. Any time one component depends on state that another component has to mutate Ive found Redux even with its boilerplate makes it more sane and logical. Rather than trying to pass around a singleton service which quickly balloons into a quagmire of too much responsibility or several singleton services which quickly balloon into a tangled mess of dependencies upon one another or broadcasting events from one component and registering listeners in another component you have one single central place where your state lives different components can make use of it as they see fit and there is a single unified interface for updating that state.Ive found even relatively simple apps benefit from this.One such example is a list component I wrote. The component includes a table component and a tab navigation component. When you start selecting rows in the list a compare selected tab has to appear which then lets you filter the master list by the IDs youve selected. You should also be able to save that filtered list and generate a share URL.The share URL and save functionality happens in a totally separate component. Neither the tab you click on or the table are aware of this behavior. The tabs only job is literally to be a tab and indicate whether its active or clicked on etc. The tables only job is literally to render a list of items its given. That means some other components need to know. Which items have been selected in the table.. When the compare selected tab has been clicked on so that it can filter the master list and give the new items to the table and also so it can display the sharesave options.. The sharesave options need to know which IDs have been selected so that a share URL can be generated and also which IDs to POST back to the server for saving.Before I introduced Redux to this it was a mess of emitting data from one component and passing that data up through one or more levels of components to get it to where it should be. When I introduced Redux everything got really simple and straightforward. ,javascript,dgqtmqg,10,t5_2qh30

Using styledcomponents is not the only way to define CSS in JS but the author writes as if it is.. The author recommends BEM style css definitions but then doesnt use it or any other global conflict resolvers when comparing the length of styling code between native and styledcomponents. Since the former will conflict with other styles this is not a legitimate comparison.. The author talks about how global conflicts with CSS are solved with technologies that are either not fully supported by a significant number of browsers shadowdom or are themselves predated by other solutions that solve the problem JSS predates css modules by over six months.,javascript,dgyo1dw,5,t5_2qh30
