5031736,0,t1_cus258y,Yes. I was trying to learn wheatpaste techniques paste toolspasting by simply aggressively pasting this simple head a bit everywhere around . There is no art being displayed here. I made this to learn techniques and spook the people in my town. I had no intention to do this forever theres little to no content behind it. If you look at the pastes closely tho most of them are placed on rather useless walls and abandonned buildings. With the exception of this one and a couple others. You can totally be a paster and use paste as a territorial marker just like graffiti artists do. Look at invader he didnt glue his ceramics in abandonned parking lots or abandonned houses. Anywhere you are in Paris you cant walk  blocks without seing one of his little ceramics. Most of them were illegally pasted. Here ,wheatpaste,cusiko4,1,t5_2sd0w
