350149,0,t3_1y3dib,Cold Air intake bumps you out of Street class and into Street Touring.If your tires are no bigger than s then you would be in STU.  If you have tires bigger than s you would be in DSP I think.Honestly the only place you would get protested is a national event.  Even then a CAI is something so minuscule that you could run locally and people wouldnt give a damn about it.  That being said you dont want to be that douche who shows up with a car thats improperly classed.  Id go with STU unless you have too big of tires.  Have fun at your first event!

3500769,0,t1_cpqbnpy,gt. taller tiresspeedo reading will be off gearing will be affected taller tire means taller gearing so if you used to redline in nd at lets say an actual mph with a taller tire you will redline at  actual mph also your center of gravity will be raised since the car now physically sits highergt. wider tireswider tires offer more lateral grip resist overheating compared to a narrow tire. Some concerns would be fitment too wide a tire and it may rub on suspension components and also daily MPG wider tires make for greater drag..

No major cities nearby so that means no large high schools no major industrial lots sports stadiums etc. And if theres any new construction  they all include stupid curbed green spaces in them now to break it up.Outside of the Watkins Glen paddock we use a shopping mall lot this one a community college and a college athletic center.

9381263,0,t3_59212o,Awesome!First lesson in dodging cones should be dont get lost.  Get that figured out first then the rest will come to you.  Oddly enough when youre bored read this Thats a good guide as to how to design an AutoX course.  Why read that?  Because you then be able to figure out what youre looking at during the course walk and then hopefully youll be able to translate that into a clean run without getting lost.Once youve got that down your next step should be to go out there and hit cones get sideways and abuse the tires.  Why?  Without finding what exceeds the limits of your car you wont be able to find out what the limit actually is.  When you go over the limit dial it back a bit and youll be closer to where the limits of the car are.  In time it will become instinct rather than something you need to concentrate on.That should get you through your first season.
