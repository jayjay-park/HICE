82416,0,t3_1ucbcv, years on and its still a brilliant game. Recently picked it up for the first time since  and its still a really fun FPS experience. Just like HalfLife  the bad graphics are forgiven by awesome gameplay.,GameSociety,cent8c4,1,t5_2sysj

I avoid black holes in the first place even with the  chance of surviving until I have a pipeline.I really like the idea of ground troops but I can see where it gets very crowded especially on a contested planet.,GameSociety,cfu19um,3,t5_2sysj
1429573,0,t3_28aa3u,Always too late to really add anything PIll just say I believe FF has one of the absolute best storylines youll find in ANY video game.  Youre looking at tons of interesting plot points and multiple scenes which are truly emotionally impactful.  After replaying it as an adult simply hearing the World of Ruin music brings a tear to my eye because of how amazing the leadup to the first time its played is.The gameplay is passable not good by any means but enjoyable enough that it doesnt ruin the far stronger aspects of the game like music and story.,GameSociety,civh2q1,1,t5_2sysj
