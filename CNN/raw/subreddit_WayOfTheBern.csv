They are frugal not by choice or planning. It is a survival skill. They wont spend time making saltine crackers when they can stop at the dollar store on they way home from work for crackers and a package of hot dogs to use in soup made from odds and ends from the food pantry. They are not only short of money but short of time. As far as dried beans and rice goes they have that down to a science. I have even learned standing in line at the food bank how to solve the problem of gastric gas from beans with the use of a common Mexican cooking herb that you can buy at Walmart.  That can be a problem when you have to eat beans for a week and still go to work because the car broke down. The trick is to mix the famine in with the feasts so you can make your food dollars or stamps last from pay period to pay period. To hoard what you can to use when a money crises happens.

BERNIE SANDERS As Americans our goal must be to elect progressives at every level. And I want to mention just a few of the progressive candidates who Our Revolution will be supporting. And there will eventually be over  of them in every region of our country candidates from the school board to the United States Senate. Vernon Miller a Native American is running for the school board in Nebraska. And let me tell you we need hundreds of candidates all over this country to run for school board. So I wish Vernon the best of luck. Jane Kim is a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and she is running for the state Senate in California. By the way their state Senate districts are like the equivalent of the entire state of Vermont so its not a small thing you know. I campaigned with Kim when I was in San Francisco and she will be a great addition to the California state Senate when she is elected.That seems to conflict with your statement in a separate comment that cs cant directly or indirectly participate in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office.

This allows weighting of races removing the principle of one person one vote.Weighted votes for example could look like thisOne person  of a vote .One person oneandahalf votes .This weighting can allow for an extraordinary amount of rigging precision.  This could be by specific voting machine absentee batch precinct or even by polling places in predominantly Black or Latino neighborhoods college areas or religious and partisan strongholds for example.Candidates can receive a set percentage of votes. For example Candidate A can be assigned  percent of the votes Candidate B  percent and Candidate C the rest.,WayOfTheBern,d7aajm3,6,t5_3ff8l

Actually a few do and its a subtle dry always understated humor.My guess?  and its all Ive got as I dont care to pick them apart too muchThey and I mean all of them are obsessed with the rational.  Everything is a debate.  They dont understand what advocacy is.  They want to believe deep down that its all simple rules and that people and market forces will sort out all the other stuff.Think doing politics from first principles and its in the pocket.  Close.  Want to blow their minds?Suggest to them they have a sell job.  Frame politics as advocacy in the majority case which it really is but they and a lot of others wont really talk about that and that the debate isnt sufficient to win the day.  Watch as they will push hard for right just true and go right for absolutes they cling to all the while ignoring what people actually value their priorities etc...Meritocracy is deeply ingrained in them.  Oppose price controls on wages links right to anyone can do the job equals essentially zero wages due to supply and demandHonestly that is my very favorite one to go after.  How we value people doesnt even resonate in their frame.  The markets value them. Soon after exploring a few of these one comes to a realization that disassociation belief in a few first principles set pieces etc... means not actually taking ownership of anything but themselves.  And unlike a Republican who will be honest and say fuck you I got mine go and get yours the Libertarians will say Pay me and Ill help you get yours but Im still gonna get mine... or some variation on that.Poor is a choice.  Never mind that basic labors always need to be done.  Never mind that we dont actually have work for everyone though to be fair to them elimination of public property focusing on the extremes of sovereign people etc... will create one hell of a lot of work sorting it all out!I jest with some of this but really the lack of humor comes from the reduction of a complex world into a few basic ideas.

And while there is some evidence that women who never marry and never have children and go into certain professions and careers are starting to achieve pay parity its not universal there are all sorts of genderbased obstacles to women being promoted and paid equally and if you want to assert that we should stop breeding to create an equal employment field thats your right. But then we need free birth control that women can use without their partners interfering and much better juriprudence and justice around rape. Just for starters.Just because Hillary Clinton is a terrible person who lies about being a feminist and falsely claims that her road to the Presidency is primarily hampered by her gender does not mean we have achieved gender equality in this country.Im guessing youre a Trump supporter.

The left has been systematically undermined crushed corralled and corrupted by corporations the ultrawealthy and their minions like the Clintons. I agree with you that the left failed to successfully counter this reactionary movement.

What do you think about the state of politics today?HST I would say that I am more into politics now than I was in . Yeah I was mesmerized a little bit by the access Clinton offered me  like total access. Come on down you know? Go out drinkin with Hillary. Yeah they did a good job on me. But I was set on beating Bush. I thought we were going to beat Bush at the IranContra hearings and I worked overtime. He was guilty as fifteen hyenas and he got off and it really bothered me. So I would have been for anybody in  just to beat Bush. And thats a dangerous trap to fall into  you know the lesser of two evils. MH Theres a lot of apathy today. People dont want to go out and vote.HST And why should they? I felt that way and I didnt vote for Clinton in . I voted for Ralph Nader. Theres a terrible danger in voting for the lesser of two evils because the parties can set it up that way. MH What do you think about the current twoparty system here?HST I dont think it is a twoparty system. And I think the reason Clinton was reelected is that he understands the same thing. He took the crime issue away from the Republicans and now hes taking the tax issue away. Hes proposing a lower capitalgains tax than the Republicans already had. So now the Democrats are champions of big business. Hes an extremely skilled fucking politician. The Clinton people all had email beepers ...MH They were wired in.HST Yeah as opposed to the Bush White House. The Clintons moved into the White House and it was like they moved into a cave. A good friend called me  a photographer very close to the Clintons  telling me ye gods we move in here and they still have a phone system that Abraham Lincoln would have appreciated. MH Clinton had wanted to be JFK. Thats who he talked about in his campaigns.HST You tell Mr. Bill theres a reason that Jack Kennedy was shot and he hasnt been. Theres a very good reason that Jack Kennedy was shot and Clinton hasnt been. MH Whats that?HST Theres no reason to shoot Clinton. They didnt hesitate when Kennedy seemed to be going against them. They shot him. And they shot Bobby. ,WayOfTheBern,d9c785t,14,t5_3ff8l

Thank you.gtIt was either  or  days ago when I had this aha moment that felt very profound to me. Ive actually been busy working on this for most of that time.

So I wanted to provide more of a complete picture especially for persons who dont live on these sites night and day if you know what I mean.gtI was actually working on another project a way to capture the best of the reddit sites because I realized that I could do a certain something that I knew how to do. And while I was working the kinks out of that all of a sudden I realized that at the heart of my fears about Hillary is my belief that she will be very dangerous for the country and that idea is really what national security is all about.

Looks like I nailed it myne  points  months ago From outside the US allied and never having been there I like to think I have a somewhat more rational perspective since it wont really affect me.I would have preferred Sanders if only to bring the people of the US the joy of never having to worry about paying a doctor so they can remain alive.Rationally hes out. The machine wont let him win. Hell get writeins. An unprecedented number I expect.Regardless the choice is between two narcissists of varying degree. So which is better?Well objectively the US system is corrupt and the nations infrastructure desperately needs a lot of work according to damn near any reputable report.The corrupt machine has ordained Hillary and despises Trump.Whod you pick if you believe the machine is corrupt?Trumps wealth come from buildings predominantly. Hillarys comes from tailgating her husband and flirting with despots. Whod you pick to rebuild a nation?You know the answer there.Objectively the SandersTrump platforms are very similar but with a different methodology. They both want to focus on the American people  both have advocated what Im calling noninterventionistnationalism.So Id say its unfair to say its only fringe Bernie supporters whore seeing a shift. If people can step out of the trees take a rational viewpoint and try to view the forest as coldly and objectively as they can manage they should note the similarities of Trump and Sanders and they should note the very well documented history of Hillary.I expect Hillarys skeletons to grasp at her ankles from beyond the grave. I expect the American people to one by one recoil in horror at her deeds and slowly work through their denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance that they were in fact thoroughly misled into liking her.Then I expect Trump to win.,WayOfTheBern,d9sel7o,18,t5_3ff8l

I guess hes not big on entitlement reform depending on the day but hell follow the money in the end.  Hes a greedy capitalist after all.  Pence and the Congressional Rs are going to be running this thing.gtIf we use it as context to show that was due to fearing the Clintons and the threat of making the oligarchy stronger then no I do not. Maybe Im crazy but I just dont think I voted for the white supremacist billionaire in order to defeat the oligarchy is going to go over too well with the people Trump built his campaign around maligning but thats just me.gtI am not against this I just dont like spreading more lies and propaganda.But like youve never identified the lies and propaganda that we are supposed to be combating.  A Trump presidency will be bad for minorities bad for immigrants bad for labor bad for the poor.  Like that aint propaganda.  Thats the obvious conclusion from looking at the policies Trump campaigned on as well as the people around Trump and the forces that will wield power in a Trump administration.  Shits scary.  Like not to make this all about myself as I will be in a better position than a lot of people under a Trump presidency but the only reason I have access to insurance is because of Obamacare preexisting conditions.  Trump has promised to repeal Obamacare as have the R majority that now controls Congress.  I am on a medication that is unaffordable without insurance.  The idea that I wont be able to get it anymore and will return to going into anaphylactic shock all the time and luckily I at this point probably have enough money to afford epi pens but so many people dont is really scary to me.  And again this is not because of any propaganda.  This is just going by what Trump and the Republicans promise to do and the obsessive way in which they have pursued the repeal of Obamacare.  And yes I want singlepayer as much as anyone but thats not what were going to get under a President Trump and an R Congress.

But the fact is except for Ross Perot who I didnt like no thirdparty candidate has been even remotely close to winning in many decades not in my lifetime anyway. So I voted pragmatically. Realistically it was a choice between Clinton and Trump. I wasnt a fan of either but I knew one would probably appoint some reasonable people to the courts at the very least.

Because the mods are liberal in terms of permitting discussion and content there are a number of folks who post here who for example advocated voting for Trump in an accelerationist notion of hurrying up the revolution blowing up the corrupt DNC which was seen as a corporatist neoliberal cesspool owned by the Clintons etc.  And there are people here who vociferously argued that accelerationism is a really bad idea that we cant ignore what a horrible guy Trump is.  There are many people here who think Trump is protofascist.  There are people who think he is not.

10104267,0,t3_5kj06p,I do think theres a deep state. I dont think its illuminati or any of that crap though. I see competing oligarchs vying for control. The republican party is an oligarchy the democratic party is an oligarchy. They both serve similar sometimes the same monies interests the only difference is the emphases they place on things. These interests are private citizens corporations and sometimes government agencies. They place priority on expanding their interests especially money. They control the parties via donations and fund campaigns and if you bite the hand that feeds you theyll fund your opponents.The system seems rigged against grassroots movements. It seems imperialist in nature. It allows some spectrum of debate but anything that threatens the oligarchs interests is squashed. Overseas it is worse. Theyll freaking kill you if you threaten their interests overseas. Theyll install corporate friendly dictatorships to remove uncooperative democracies. Here they only use dirty tricks and party machinery to shut you down. Overseas they will KILL you.I wonder how free America really is after this election. We talk about democracy and freedom a lot but our actions show we care more about money and natural resources. We seem to be very oligarchical in practice. The people have little say in government.

10134635,0,t3_5l352j,Nathan Tankus wrote an article called The Crackpot Realism of Clintonian Politics back in February that gives many of the actual reasons that Clintonism should rightfully be dead after this election.gtThe most bizarre thing about these desperate calls to realism is our modern context. In what possible way is it realistic to continue voting for the lesser evil when we have an ongoing climate catastrophe no mainstream Democrat or Republican is willing to discuss let alone actually do something significant about? During Obamas first term he even pressured environmental groups to stop or tone down their discussions of climate change. Each lesser evil candidate just happens to be a greater evil than the last one. Each of their politics is unimaginable even as one is in the throes of the attacks on basic human decency engendered by the last one. The slogan of the Democratic party is it could always be worse while the promise is it will always be worse. When your realism involves supporting a trend that could quite realistically mean the end of human civilization forgive me for holding you in contempt.snipgtWhat they miss is these right wing Democrats have profoundly shaped this status quo. Bill Clintons treatment of poor people was unimaginable before him and par for the course after him. Obamas treatment of ordinary homeowners would have been a preposterous fictional story of campy villainy. Now its just how the world works. Sanders for all his faults on issues like Israel and immigration He got much better on these issues during the primary. is actually looking to push the center to the left for once and is hoping to galvanize ordinary people to do it. Its the realism of the psych ward that says well solve climate change help ordinary people and build a workable economy by supporting an endless series of politicians who care less and less about the issues that matter and exploit hopeful supporters more and more cynically. Admonishing young people for both not voting and desiring anything other than a debtcrippled climatologicallyunstable future feels more like admonishing serfs for being insufficiently pious and for caring about what happens to themselves or their children on this plane of existence. In short realism is just a code word for shut up sit down and be quiet. ,WayOfTheBern,dbsjpx3,8,t5_3ff8l

A mixture of first black president the positive media surrounding him the energy of his campaign and the progressive rhetoric he dressed his campaigns in really made it seem like this man was a giant who was going to change Washington. Then all throughout the years most MSM was very positive covering Obama so the only negative things I saw were sources like Jones and FOX peddling stuff like the birther theory. I thought if these people are so desperate maybe Obama really is doing a fantastic job. Throughout those eight years whenever I would see him speak or interact w world leaders or other U.S. politicians he conducted himself with immense grace and poise and always seemed in control of the situation hence why he seemed like a giant. Now? Its hard not to pity the way his administration is ending. Everything literally everything he did in the past eight years will be wiped away the first two years under Trump. ACA executive orders certain foreign policy decisions etc. His final days are like those moments in stories where everyone in the kingdom knows the King is failing and the King gives some crazy order but then everyone in his court ignores it and stares at him. The King gets angry and shouts at the guards to arrest everyone becoming more manic by the moment but the guards just stand there and stare at him. Then someone more calm and respected orders the guards to arrest the King and thats how his legacy dies. ,WayOfTheBern,dbuhqzv,2,t5_3ff8l

Best work comes when people of different skill sets come together and tackle problems.  Maybe some neurobiologists can get together with electricalcomputer engineers and robotics engineers and do this.  I mentioned in another reply my lab did work on neural networks grown in culture and used them to process information for robotic arms.  Very preliminary but it does work at a basal level.  So yea I didnt know about nonbinary computers.  Thanks for bringing that up.  There are other things wed need to tackle but like you said we simply dont have the answer yet doesnt mean the answer doesnt exist.  Another thing that would need to be tackled is neuroplasticity.

I doubt it.gtSomething like  of the voting age population affirmatively voted for Hillary Clinton half her votes came from people propagandized into thinking she was safer and to the left of Trump when she is not and maybe half of those passionately cared about electing her. Im not too worried about them.Like it or not these people are the real Democratic base. You cant just say lol nope at  million people. If Bernie really can get people in the system then they will be joined by the  million  assuming he doesnt selfdestructively insult as traitors. Besides do you really think Bernie could win Nebraska or Utah just on increased turnout? I dont.gtOur problem is the structural obstacles the legacy parties have created so they can maintain their corrupt power and continue their destructive immiseration of most of the population. Those  of rich racist white people who really really cared about Hillary Clinton and her repulsive plans are not that big a deal by comparison.But who does Sanders want in its place? He has never been totally clear.gtWhy on earth are you insulting a community working for progressive change if you voted for Stein?Because I am annoyed and scared at the growing push for a redbrown alliance against the establishmentglobalazation simply because fight the common enemy neoliberals. Yes neoliberalism is cancer its unfair its structurally racist its antiworker it destroys communities and cant be tolerated by anyone with any basic belief in fairness.But fascism is worse.When people like Sanders reach out to Trump when they ignore the white nationalist pandering or dismiss it with whataboutery when they suggests that we should work with groups like UKIP or the Le Penists it means weve lost sight of who we are. A lot of leftists are increasingly okay with allying with extreme right groups as long as they dont openly chant Third Reich slogans. Those groups are worse than neoliberals. They should not be accepted or tolerated.I dont actually hate Sanders or even most of his supporters but theres a vocal subelement of his base that seem to be going toward the redbrown road by allying with Trump voters. Thats a bad direction.

10242935,0,t1_dc4xhqj,I see the difference this wayI want to talk about this some.  Its a good dialog to have.First I do not advocate an increase in tolerance for racism bigotry and theocracy.  Those things remain unacceptable.The dialog can go a couple ways racism as an exampleFirst way is You are a racist.  In this mode of dialog a personal judgement is made other person is on the defensive and the potential for any positive outcome is generally predicated on their acceptance of that judgement.Lets hold the thought of it being correct off to the side for a moment.  The second way this conversation can go is That comes off as racist.  The difference here is a judgement on the person isnt made directly however a judgement on the actions or perception related to that action or statement whatever is made.In this scenario getting something good to happen is not predicated on a personal judgement being accepted.  Additionally we could offer to help and or give them an out to act or not act and do so in both a positive way as well as not in a way that inhibits doing good.One thing Ive learned over the last  years is personal judgements are a major league sticking point.  Prior to experiencing how Bernie does politics Ive had some experiences that showed me there are multiple ways to get at these social problems and there is no one size fits all.Notice how rarely Bernie will make a personal judgement?  About the only one I can think of is Trump and Bernie flat out said Ill do everything in my power to avoid having a bigot be President of the United States.In most other cases he will take it back to an issue and or speak to it in a way that leaves the other person free to improve their position without the direct threat personal judgements tend to carry with them.Im for the second way a lot more than I am the first way.  For years I conducted most of my advocacy in the first way.  And part of how this sub runs is linked to that.  We do call out that which should be called out.The idea being anyone who doesnt like that can make better choices.  Fair enough.  Applying the second way that comes off as racist works in subtle ways that may actually be more potent than a declaration of a personal judgement does.Say they say or do something racist.  Or say they have a history of this stuff.That history is known and if they are a public figure at all its not like they havent heard it all before either.  They have and they do not care or its worth it to them somehow.So they do a racist thing or say a racist thing.  Whatever.  Now there are grounds to make the judgement and express it.  But say that doesnt happen.  What does?First that thing they said or did will be judged.  Thats clearly racist to me.  Or Where I come from that kind of thing is racist as hell!  Sure glad I didnt say it.Then verify or reinforce shared good intent.Isnt this more about making sure everyone has health care?  And You didnt intend racism did you?Very few people will say yes to that.  A few will.  Judge the fuck out of them.  They are lost to us just not good humans.  But the ones who wont say yes to that are already inhibited already are feeling heat on it.Look I know you didnt mean it how can I help get this back on track?    Something to that effect.  Offer them the out.  They will either take it or not take it and its on them to do that.  They judge themselves and we imply that judgement but dont actually do it full on directly.At this point in the whole thing we will have established its racist racist isnt good they can get help and the intent is to do right by the people not discriminate against them for things they have no control over.  What Ive noticed is the moment that personal judgement is out there its full stop.  Whatever dialog happened stops happening and typically its a big ass subject change.Ive also noticed that I can take that indirect path speaking to the thing action statement leaves the door open to continue doing the good.  How about I handle this and you go do X we can talk later.  Or We cant get this done for the people if we are going to make it about those people.  Economic need for example here isnt a racial issue.  People are hurting.  Now you arent wrong about this  If you say racist shit and support racist policies you ARE a racist.Truth.However norms vary widely.  Say that in Portland Oregon and yeah.  No worries.  Say it in Baker City or Antelope and maybe get shown the door hard.One of the things that has helped move Oregon politics along is using the second way to have those conversations.The primary obstacle is personal judgement.  Yes at that moment they are racists or very ill informed or broken somehow.  However they may not desire to be racists or may choose to begin to end being a racist too.The public personal judgement endures.  Once a racist always a racist despite the fact that people can and do change.  The second way allows for that while also not allowing the racism.  Its entirely possible to be firm manage the dialog discourage the racism while leaving them every option to demonstrate good intent both in terms of not furthering racism and getting whatever good done.Putting class at the front means its the foundation for the intent to make it better for the people.  Objective very hard to deny human need is the root justification.  Above that are all sorts of things and including identity.  Maybe more black people are in need than white people.  A pure identity argument would actually invite who needs their need fixed first?Truth is there is just need and good policy improves on it for everyone.You are also not wrong about Trump getting a LOT of racist votes.  Thats obvious as hell.  But we as a group including Bernie also arent wrong about the economic roots for change here too.Tons of people didnt believe in the Democratic Party deal voted Trump for change and did so not really believing Trump would make for good change as much as they did a very difficult to deny statement about the Democratic Party deal for sure not being fair at all.Just had a good friend tell me this.  We had not talked for a few months.  He voted Trump for one singular reason the establishment deal isnt fair period.  This friend is an islander.  Seen his share of racism.  We worked together a lot and found ourselves in the heart of Alabama for a gig.  The first way would have sent us packing.  The second way saw the work get done a few friends made and some apologies given one from an obvious racist who ended up feeling pretty bad and came out about it over a few beers at the end of the project too.Had we done the first way for sure failure enemies made.  But we did the second way got it done and friends made.  Now that guy may still be a racist but hes not gonna be one around us and we arent enabling him either but we did find common ground to get the good stuff done.The way I see all of this is class runs under everything.  When something like racism comes up its almost always possible to identify that as the wrong conversation to be having take the dialog back to the right conversation to be having leave them the out to play it differently in the future and not make enduring enemies along the way like what always happens with a full on public personal judgement.Being about the ideas first and foremost brings with it some new work and some costs.  Has to or we arent about the ideas first and foremost.So which is it?Im about the ideas.  That doesnt mean Ill put up with or approve of racism.  But it does mean I will absolutely work with others to get a good thing done and do so in ways that leave their racism behind or personal to them their problem.  And Ill even give them help too and let them know its OK to seek it.  So far in my life both personal and professional the second way has played out better across the board.  Ive had those chats How do you guys do it over there in Oregon?  The real hard core racists are never ever going to give it up.  The best we can hope for is to beat it back discourage it make all the alliances and set all the positive norms we can so they are left to one another in dark little clubs or other out of the way places.  They can stay there and jerk one another off too.  Fine.But out in the open overt?  No way.  And by handling it as a gaffe or error or any other thing but that personal judgement the door is open for them to play along suppress it and the good gets done.If needed the fight can be done later or separated from getting that good done.IMHO Ive kind of botched this.  But the talk is worth having.  So lets have it.  DTrump is racist as hell.  I have no doubt.  I also cannot ever prove that or get the real hard core racists to demonstrate acceptance of that fact.  They themselves must do that.But if Trump wants to do something good for people and its a class action not racially motivated or racially implemented etc... its got to be possible to have that dialog or the good simply wont happen and we are left with OPPOSE EVERYTHING and back to the same general shit that got us here in the first place.Ill bet if we can get some good done take the second path on these conversations where we can and we cant always do that a whole lot of these people who may trend racist or who just are due to various peer effects may see the good toss in want more and just quietly quit being racist.And thats fine.  Nobody needs to know.  Just stop and yes Ill help you do that.  All you gotta do is ask.  We all want to be good people doing good things got your back no problem.You wont catch me enabling or validating racism bigotry and theocracy for good reason.

10277307,0,t3_5n6fu8,gtNow you might object that all this is well and good as a way for small groups of people to get on with each other but managing a city or a country is an entirely different matter. And of course there is something to this. Even if you decentralize society and put as much power as possible in the hands of small communities there will still be plenty of things that need to be coordinated from running railroads to deciding on directions for medical research. But just because something is complicated does not mean there is no way to do it democratically. It would just be complicated. In fact anarchists have all sorts of different ideas and visions about how a complex society might manage itself. To explain them though would go far beyond the scope of a little introductory text like this. Suffice it to say first of all that a lot of people have spent a lot of time coming up with models for how a really democratic healthy society might work but second and just as importantly no anarchist claims to have a perfect blueprint. The last thing we want is to impose prefab models on society anyway. The truth is we probably cant even imagine half the problems that will come up when we try to create a democratic society still were confident that human ingenuity being what it is such problems can always be solved so long as it is in the spirit of our basic principles  which are in the final analysis simply the principles of fundamental human decency.  ,WayOfTheBern,dc8zlfm,1,t5_3ff8l

10463802,0,t3_5pmy3f,Hi Aquapyr just wanted to say thank you for this post.  It was lovely to see your money is like water analogy I have held this view for quite some time.  I think of it when it comes to offshoring jobs.  When wages are paid to a worker that worker then has money in their pocket and they can use that money to buy products and services.  When they buy it is called demand.  Businesses notice that demand and try to fill it buy creating products and services to sell historically this has meant hiring workers to make those products and services and thus the cycle begins again.  Wages are spent workers are hired to produce products and services wages are earned.  Lather Rinse Repeat.When offshoring happens the wageswater is sent out of the country.  This is great for those countries as now those workers have money in their pockets.  Because the money is now THERE businesses now strive to make products and services that are attractive to THOSE WORKERS.  As this process occurs America will literally become a kind of economic desert.  Folks here will not have money in their pockets to spend and the lack of demand will also be noticed so products and services available here now will slowly disappear.  I consider offShoring to be economic treason as it does in fact inflict damage on Americas economy significant amounts of it will turn America into a wasteland.  This is a national threat to our general Welfare and should be treated accordingly.,WayOfTheBern,dcu6fkm,4,t5_3ff8l

10652937,0,t3_5sfk8a,One thing I find frustrating in the extreme is the way the term progressive has been coopted corrupted and rendered nearly meaningless by politicians whose ideology represents the antithesis of what the original Progressive movement  dating back to the s  was truly about.  According to George Washington UniversitygtProgressivism began as a social movement and grew into a political movement. The early progressives rejected Social Darwinism. In other words they were people who believed that the problems society faced poverty violence greed racism class warfare could best be addressed by providing good education a safe environment and an efficient workplace. Progressives lived mainly in the cities were college educated and believed that government could be a tool for change.Rejection of Social Darwinism  one of the key philosophical underpinnings of the socalled Gilded Age  was one of the most important and critical components of progressiveism. But what is the neoliberal embrace of meritocracy  extensively discussed in Thomas Franks recent book Listen Liberal  but an updated and somewhat more sophisticated variation of Social Darwinism? Both promote the notion that it is in the natural order of things for the strong to prosper and the weak fall by the wayside. Left unsaid but implicit in the Social Darwinian model is the notion that a primary role of government is to help facilitate this process of natural selection. Thus the phenomenon we have observed since the s  when neoliberalism became the dominant philosophy of both mainstream political parties  of the rich continually getting richer and the poor getting poorer is not a bug but a feature.Sadly I dont think theres any way those of us who actually honor the tenets of the original Progressive movement can ever reclaim or rehabilitate that term.  Tom Perez is just the latest in a long line of neoliberal corporate sellouts who have ostentatiously applied the progressive label to themselves despite a long history of embracing policies diametrically opposed to what true progressiveism represents.Personally I prefer the term egalitarian which dictionary.com defines simply as asserting resulting from or characterized by belief in the equality of all people especially in political economic or social life. Though I doubt it will ever catch on nevertheless I believe the term captures the essence of what the genuine Left  not only in the U.S. but all over the world  is advocating far better than any other single word description.,WayOfTheBern,dderoe1,8,t5_3ff8l

At best such attempts are wellintentioned at worst they are establishment sheepdogging but in either case they are doomed to fail and will waste misdirect and blunt any popular demand for real change from the left. Another way to look at this To create real change we need real power. To achieve that we need to form a movement based on a broad coalition of the working class across the political spectrum  from hard right to hard left  to either force our political system to pay attention and see to our needs or to tear the whole thing down. The Democratic party will never be able to do this because it is and will always be the lefthand silo of our deliberately divided and conquered political system. Right now the fight is left vs. right which serves the oligarchy just fine.

Khan added antitrust laws arent updated to properly assess companies in the internet economy.  Due to a change in legal thinking and practice in the s and s antitrust law now assesses competition largely with an eye to the shortterm interests of consumers not producers or the health of the market as a whole antitrust doctrine views low consumer prices alone to be evidence of sound competition Khan wrote. It is as if Bezos charted the companys growth by first drawing a map of antitrust laws and then devising routes to smoothly bypass them. With its missionary zeal for consumers Amazon has marched toward monopoly by singing the tune of contemporary antitrust.Scary stuff especially because our government is too dysfunctional to make the corrections needed to prevent a complete takeover by Bezos vertical monopoly.,WayOfTheBern,ddt4uqe,3,t5_3ff8l

All of it so far from what Ive looked into seems about as flimsy as Trump claiming that there were millions of illegal voters in the general election. If the DNC had truly rigged the primaries Sanders would not have gotten  of the vote. He would not have pulled off that upset in Michigan. The Clintons would not have allowed it to drag on that long if they were really capable of just changing the votes.I think the easier explanation is that he didnt get enough name ID amongst minorities until it was too late and also I think ageism and antiSemitism played a role in people not voting for him.

Not that Im saying that there isnt the possibility of biasmanipulation with the mods  in some cases that is pretty obvious.  Even so its like a political marketing war out there.On the one hand you have David Brocks messaging which I think is change the party from within dont be a baby you are too pure  or something along those lines.  He might also be behind change first past the post before creating a third party and the third parties dont work and Jill Stein is Satans spawn and of course the classic but the republicans are worse etc.I think the Russians or Trumpsters angle is more Bernie sold out andor the DNC doesnt want your stupid vote anyway could be David Brock as well.

11145716,0,t3_5z2wns,In  I decided to go back to school to get an associates degree in land surveying. It took over  years because of all the required classes I needed so it ended up costing more then expected but it was community college so I wasnt ridiculously expensive but still not cheap either. So I get a lucky break and get a job as a survey tech while Im still in school it paid  an hour but at that time I was just happy to get in anywhere.Well over a year later no longer in school unable to finish my degree because I ran out of money and Im still making  and hour for a job I spent over  years at school learning to do BTW most of the schooling was useless. My boss was a nice guy but he just refused to give me a raise. After a year there I asked and he said I was still in an evaluation period whatever that means and couldnt pay me anymore. I also realized that if I did get a raise it would only be a dollar or so because the guy I worked under who had been there for years was only making  an hour.Anyway I ended up having to quit because I just couldnt make ends meet and I was working my ass off in all weather condition in nasty thorns and poison ivy and I wasnt getting shit for it. Its expensive to live in NY state and I didnt get health insurance either luckily I got Obamacare for that or I would have been shit out of luck.Well now I work a job that has nothing to do with either of my degrees and I make more money doing it although still not enough it seems.

The French enjoy a level of economic security and living standards that most Americans can only dream about universal health care free childcare and publicuniversity education a hour workweek higher life expectancy and lower per capita energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The new government say people who oppose Mr. Mlenchons views will have to focus on reducing the public debt.gtBut the numbers do not bear them out.gtThe most important measure of a countrys public debt is the interest burden it must pay annually. The interest France currently pays on its debt amounts to . percent of GDP which is modest by both historical standards and most international comparisons today. The United States by comparison had interest burdens on its debt ranging from about . percent to about . percent of GDP throughout the s and during that time it enjoyed the longest economic expansion in its history.gtThere are however constraints from the European Union. France has no problem with its current account balance at the moment but were it to try to jumpstart its economy while growth in the eurozone remained sluggish it could eventually run an unsustainable deficit. Under the Maastricht Treaty France is supposed to keep its budget deficit under  percent of GDP. That requirement along with Frances commitment to the European Union program for deficit reduction would appear to preclude spending increases such as the ones that Mr. Mlenchon proposes.gtBut Europe cannot endure another decade of mass unemployment which denies a future to so many young people and fuels the xenophobic far right. This is the reason Mr. Mlenchon has called for renegotiating European Union treaties. Some argue that position is too radical. Yet it is those who champion strict adherence to the European authorities failed economic policies who stoke antiEuropean sentiment and endanger the future of European integration.

My understanding is youre one of the people who did not go.  Why did you not go?Bernie gtFor precisely the reason that you gave.  These supposedly highly classified briefings always take place in what is called the SKIF room in the Congress which is a very well designed room to prevent any cybersecurity issues or security issues is general.  What I did not want to be is part of a photo opportunity or a political effort on the part of the White House.

11769672,0,t3_67y4zu,gtTheir white working class males lack of hope is the direct inverse of the lie theyve been sold for decades  that prosperity is within their reach because America is the land of limitless and neverending prosperity especially for the naturally superior. In the reality of their economic suffering this lie torments them and they see no way out. The possibility of a revolutionary solution has been taken off the table for them by those who profit from the status quo. For Blacks Latinos Women and many Asians in America revolution has always been a possibility because weve grown up knowing the table was tilted against us recognizing the lies spread about us by the corporate media and demagogues knowing that we lived in a culture where some profited from us being underpaid from us being denied jobs denied housing denied absence of selfworth  just as all of these things we know and understood about their own circumstances by preWWII nonHispanic White male workers. The Red Scare designed to depoliticize them and the postwar job boom convinced them revolution was unnecessary. They spent the next twenty years living in a Middle Class bubble and the next thirty years living in a state of enforced denial a denial sold to them by a corporate government which needed them to not understand the actual cause of their situation. Now all they are left with is despair.,WayOfTheBern,dgu4ga1,5,t5_3ff8l
