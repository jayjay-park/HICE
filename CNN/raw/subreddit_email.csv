If they allow you to POP or IMAP you can bring your own mail client  a good one like Thunderbird which supports a much wider ruleset for filters.Or you can use Gmail as the POP or IMAP client and let Gmail filter it out for you.You might also try opening a ticket with the abuse desk at your host and provide them some samples of the spam mail they can use to tune their filters at the server level.,email,cex5u36,1,t5_2qmv4

The former is free and clear in terms of CANSPAM because they relate to the servicegoods provided. It sounds like you might have some spam traps hiding out in your email list. If youre only really emailing for transactions then people crying spam is a lot less likely as their engagement level is far above the norm. However theres a point when email addresses end up dying on the ESP level and when the actual ESP gets an email to a very inactiveunengaged address they start flagging as spam.  The customers you have that are saying your messages are in spam ask them to move those messages into their inbox. Gmail especially pays close attention to customer interactions and will adjust your reputation accordingly based on how they interact. It sounds dated but you can add one of those add xyz.com to your safe senders list to your header it can help if people do so.  How are you sending thesewho are you using? Are you sending from Outlook or a private email provider like Gmail? That type of solution is only so sustainable. If youre using a smallbusiness solution like MailChimp or StreamSend those companies use collective IP addresses and you can talk to customer service about how to improve your delivery.  Depending on your method delivery if a youre sending from Outlook or Gmail please stop and consider a smallbusiness platform to send from. Many are nominal in cost and they handle these problems for you actively and on top of it many provide mobileresponsive templates as a bonus or b you are sending from a smallbusiness platform talk to customer service or seek out a reputation monitoring service such as ReturnPath or okTo your last point there are so so many resources available to provide mobileresponsive designs. You can find free opensourced templates or theres many companies that offer bundles of  or so templates that are easy to customize with drag and drop designs. I recently went shopping for the same and settled on PSDHTML theyre expensive ea but you can design an email template in Photoshop or have someone do it for you and they take the PSD file and convert it to an HTMLCSS document thats mobile responsive. This was beneficial because you own the content legally and you can create a template that contains multiple design elements and just cherry pick what you need per email. Hope this helps I can take a look at your code examples over the weekend if you need. Good luck! Getting into the inbox can be a bitch but you will see such amazing results.,email,cri7ahf,1,t5_2qmv4
