The gladius is stock other than removing all the fairings cat delete midpipe and a yoshi cat back. Ill try the heavier fork oil in the front and it would be nice to get an adjustable shock for the rear suspension but Im a pretty light dude so the rear springrate works for me. I think the main issue with the brakes on the gladius is that it uses a single banjo bolt off the master cylinder for both brake lines instead of one bolt for the front and one for the rear like the sv. The brakes on both my bikes look exactly the same other than that but the sv bites so much harder and I like the pressure progression as you pull the lever more. I think they both have the same total braking power but you really gotta take a fistful of lever on the gladius when I could use two fingers on the sv and stop the same. ,SVRiders,cwg6pnq,1,t5_2sbsn

The evo and the Hella were both exactly the same brightness with a photography light meter but the hella gave much better night visibility due to the standard color.

6734696,0,t1_d0f74u7,gt Definitely Loctited!So were the screws hard to get out? Did you have to heat them with a torch or just use brute force on your screwdriver?I was reading my Haynes manual last night and it appears that the secondary throttle valves close further on K and K models than they do on K through K models at least in startup mode where they open all the way and then return to the  degree open position.The earlier model STVs return to a  open position.Logic tells me that the TPS signals the ECU that the primary butterfly on the rear throttle body is closed and so the ECU tells the STV servo to close also making the FI system work like a CV carburetor.Now Im wishing I had bought a first generation SV with carbs they are a lot simpler than FI.The STV sensor on the rear throttle body is just telling the ECU what position the rear STV is in.Given that my warm idle is at  RPM now I dont think I will have to reset the TPS as long as I dont remove the STV butterflies.Im hoping that the problem really was just a matter of too much slack in the opening throttle cable but I wont know until I go for another ride next week.,SVRiders,d0fxcuh,1,t5_2sbsn

10002120,0,t3_5isi6v,I put on a set of Denali D led they are so bright they kill my night vision on Hi beam so I normally run them on low beam and use my bikes high beam for night riding.If I use Hi beam to encourage a left lane hog it blazes the inside of their car and they cant see in front so they invariably hit their brakes. I learned not to do this.I only use Hi beam on the Denali when Im in the mountains maybe coming home late when Im tired and going slow just stupid bright.,SVRiders,dbbazib,1,t5_2sbsn

10988636,0,t1_dedikwg,Yeah I actually looked a lot into the rr issue and the previous owner said he swapped the rectifier so Im gonna remove the rear cowl and check if its the original today. When you swapped it was it a pretty involved process or did it just plug right in? ,SVRiders,dedizhp,1,t5_2sbsn

11345192,0,t1_dfhunnk,Yep all I did was cut out the bracket and then I took two pieces of aluminum stock and bent them to where I wanted them. I cut holes in those pieces of aluminum on each end and I bolted them in to the bottom of the triple where the cable holders are. And yes I did paint them black halfway through the process,SVRiders,dfhyhah,1,t5_2sbsn
11435777,0,t1_dfs55x9,gt  is there any way to know which cylinder was firing? In other words which valves I should check for damage? Or will I have to check both cylinders?Start with the front cylinder which is what you were working on. If the front cylinder wasnt firing the porcelain nose will be blackened from the soot of unburned gasoline and even oil.gtgt need to think seriously about how to avoid things like this in the future if Im going to keep working on my engine.Read the manual carefully and ask questions and view as many yoiutube videos as you can find on whatever project youre working on.And dont feel bad youre not the only owner who has had problems setting the valve timing on an SV.,SVRiders,dfs8fr7,2,t5_2sbsn

11527405,0,t1_dg26n2i,Thanks I wasnt sure about the color at first but after seeing it completed it was a good choice. This particular color is Stealth Grey from the Ford Focus RS. I like the darker contrast to the bright frame. Originally I wanted to do white bodywork and black frame but the leaking tank bumped up painting and didnt want all the extra downtime right now to do the frame also. ,SVRiders,dg2mszx,1,t5_2sbsn

11646312,0,t3_665h4c,In D.C. I paid k for a  and the price of living here is really high. Probably pretty close to the same as your cost of living. I used to live in CA so I at least have a similar baseline. Our bike would go for around  to k here. However our riding season isnt as long as yours so you may be able to squeeze an extra hundred or two out of it.,SVRiders,dgg4g5v,1,t5_2sbsn
