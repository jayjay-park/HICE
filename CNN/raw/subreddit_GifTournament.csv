The point Im trying to make is you cant distinguish the two based on who had the most effort and time put into finding the optimal footage. This simply makes voting a little unfair seeing as its more about the footage rather than the skill or creativity. Its just for sake of voting nothing else.

6939092,0,t1_d12v8iz,If you want to get into Anime theres no better place to start than Cowboy Bebop.It was the first Anime I watched that wasnt Dragon Ball Z which is infinitely better in abriged form and its incredibly accessible for several reasons.First and foremost its widely regarded as one of the best Anime of all time. Second its a closed series. There are  episodes and a movie the movie is optional so you dont have anything crazy like One Piece which is almost at  episodes. Third its one of the few anime where the English Dub is widely regarded as the best version. Many anime especially older anime Cowboy Bebop is from the s suffer from horrible lazy english dubs. Bebop is a rare exception. So much care and effort was put into the english dub that it surpassed the original Japanese dub.Even if you simply dont like Anime watch this series. Even if you dont like cartoons at all watch this series. Hell the sound design and music is so good that I would go as far as to say that even the blind should watch this series.

6987691,0,t3_4bahkr,Its time for the semifinals the sequels prequel the final dictation of who endures.MATCHUP NUMBER ONEThe Bus that cant stop running people over Working Titlevs.The HairLineThis is a hard fought decision. One that I might be changing my mind on many times Im even changing my mind right now!. This is one of the real battles where to make a real decision the finer tenants of quality need to be analyzed in HairSplitting detail.This one might get long so lets talk about the other matchup first.MATCHUP NUMBER TWOThe Birds and the Beesvs.STOP man!This is a little easier of a decision. We have a metaphorical process of conception against STOP man! Unfortunately STOP man didnt make it to the podium to stop this conception. To me seeing the big reveal at the end of the conception gif was a big payoff and I was carried through the entire setup. But the length of the conception gif is a big point of contention so it wouldnt surprise me to see some votes lost as people get really tired to the point that the payoff no matter how big the payoff might be could be enough.Nevertheless I give my vote to The Birds and the BeesNOW BACK TO MATCHUP NUMBER ONESo first of all like I said were splitting a lot of hairs to come to this decision so lets discuss this point by point.gt Length The two gifs handle length differently for their punchline. The Bus gif does its best to stretch the payoff as far as possible while the Hair gif brings all of its punchline early and gives time to lament. So who wins?To me this category goes to The Bus gif. The Hair gif in my opinion didnt take enough time before putting up the punchline. This criterion was what led me to initially vote for The Bus. However something else bugged at me so that needs to be brought up next.gt Consistency This has to do with the scenery over all. One gif completely breaks consistency by introducing the Futurama scene. The other has text to work with but makes an attempt to fit it into the scene. Whether this text choice sits with you worse than the scene choice could be personal preference.The Futurama Scene was a huge blunder in my opinion and would have required something other than text usage to still be ok in this category.For now the final vote still goes to our NonStop Bus but this will be the hard fought matchup that Ive been waiting for. Tune in later this week to hear the final verdict and how it stacks against the winning opinion.,GifTournament,d18e9cv,3,t5_32ukt
7013539,0,t3_4bpux4,First of all congrats uharris. Your gif was great and it was a joy competing against you. MFW the round was postedFor those who didnt realize the title Just Two More was a pun on the cancer gif. It was actually really hard coming up with a pun that didnt spoil the joke. To be completely honest I was a total idiot and thought this week was unexpected not combined gifs and didnt even bother checking again until after the deadline. It still was a combined gif but I was planning a different gif for this round. uharris had an amazing gif this week so I dont know if it would have even made a difference. Sorry uButcherofhope I tried to make your bracket with me winning be prophetic. Onto the sources since I used things that no one would have recognized. You have no idea how hard it is to find footage of a guy getting ready and talking to someone. Seriously. Think about it. Theres a lot of footage of women getting ready in media but not that many of men. I ended up having to photoshop an entire person out and do a lot of color correction from this video to make it fit the gif concept I wanted to do.This was the cancer video I used. It was a rough night at the laundromat watching so many videos about cancer. Being misty eyed in a public place isnt a good look on me. ,GifTournament,d1bbzin,40,t5_32ukt
