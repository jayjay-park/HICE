5338637,0,t3_3nu4rf,Ive put much more serious time into LLSIF than I have Starlight Stage so far but Starlight Stage mechanically feels like a better game by far.That being said there are much better otoge you could be playing out there than either of these two.,idolmaster,cvu2ivt,0,t5_2t4t4
5780937,0,t1_cxdbu64,Its mostly on nico nico if you dont mind. Although there might be some to find on sound cloud too.Remixes under this tagMashups under this tagTheres an album in particular I found interesting called Yukipo Nation. It was released by a Yukiho fan for her birthday years back. I think the beats are original and it has Yukihos voice clips to go with each track. There was also one before that. Sadly they never released another after that at least that I know of which is a shame as the nd one was an improvement on the st.Links here its a free download.For Official remix albums not including remsters or  offs like onegai cinderella jazz mix theres Famison BITiDOLMSTER which has bit remixes of existing songs  some new songs based off popular namco games one of my favorites is the Agent Yoru wo Yuku Hoover amp Acid MIX The Remixes Collection THE IDOLMSTER TO DNCE TO and the perfect idol series. I also like the remix of FOUR on THE iDOLMSTER Vocal Collection .Also Im from Florida.,idolmaster,cxdohjw,3,t5_2t4t4

8450413,0,t1_d5ttf3q,This is a little very late but I got my copy and been able to play it so if youre still curious and havent found a rundown yet The gameplay is divided into seasons and weeks like OFA. There dont seem to be any more rival battles or auditions just lives. Work and lessons return but you can only do one action a week and lessons take up time unlike OFA so you have to choose wisely. Lessons are permanent boosts again but VocalDanceVisual is different its AppealOmoideBurst which increase the power of your regular appeals memory appeals and burst time respectively. Theres lessons for each of them. The VocalDanceVisual buttons youd hit during lives to a constant beat are now turned into one central point to hit predetermined different buttons on kind of like a traditional rhythm game. You produce all  idols at the same time like OFA. At the end of each season theres an All Star Live again like OFA but its every season instead of just at the end of Summer and Winter. Ranking up your idols works the same as in OFA you gather fans and then challenge the rank up festival. Getting your idol to B rank gives you access to the Extreme Live Festival and when you beat this you beat their route.,idolmaster,d5xu6of,1,t5_2t4t4
8457161,0,t1_d5yo3sp,Ranking the producer up is based on how many Fan all your idols have accrued cumulatively. Personally I think the best way to Rank up is to focus on three and then five idols. Youll eventually want to do this by the time you get an Idol to B rank anyways so you might as well start sooner than later. Switch your Leader and rank up your idols whenever you have the opportunity to. At the end of each year youll have access to a special set of Concerts Usually they have ALL Star in their name completing these concerts also net you a massive amount of fans as well.Basically the quickest way to Rank up is to start grinding as much as you can sooner than later.,idolmaster,d5yohlx,2,t5_2t4t4
8463324,0,t1_d5zbnzi,ahh same i got into the series round when Ms had their final live im a huge fan of aqours though. do you have any particular  songs youd reccomend?,idolmaster,d5zga1e,1,t5_2t4t4
8800052,0,t1_d75g5cf,From what Im aware its a project started for a TV show  its gonna be about them being cast for the project then theyll make a drama or something. Unless it just relocates the premise to South Korea its p much only related in name. ,idolmaster,d75na83,3,t5_2t4t4
9365849,0,t3_58ojqv,During st Vision I was a YukihoP then went ChihayaP when the anime came out but became a HibikiP when I first discovered the live concerts. Love them all.,idolmaster,d936snw,1,t5_2t4t4
9973086,0,t3_5ic9ob,Three I havent played OFA yet but I got Ims last month and am having a blast. The Japanese isnt a problem for me and I enjoy the story aspect and talking with the idols. Edit I think even if you dont undestand it all you can still enjoy the game. Also there is a guide. below. Two. There is an excellent guide online in English for ims Wiki fandom one which has strategies various stats and the best answers for replying to characters in the game. Just pause the game and select the suggested reply in the guide. Ten I havent bought any DLC...because they are so expensive! Last year they apparently had a  off sale...If they have another one I might be tempted to get some DLC content.Seven In ims I think its the same for OFA  each costume and accessory have points for appeals Dance Visual and Vocal. For example a costume might have DA  Vi Vo . ,idolmaster,db7iqms,2,t5_2t4t4
9990746,0,t1_db74t2k,Like totooria mentioned  has its own unique points that were removed in OFA. I enjoyed the strategic elements that were in  it was really important because you had limited time to clear your objectives weekly schedule planning was super important lol. The storydriven aspectsrivals were great too I had a great time with the festival battles. ,idolmaster,db9tle8,2,t5_2t4t4

10505094,0,t1_dcyuiwr,Wait so the no piracy rule isnt that strict? Because thats precisely what I was getting at lol. Im not too picky about the DLC songs since all I really need is more Ritsuko in my life. To my understanding all these games have unlockable OVAs and the Ritsuko bot on Twitter has recently started posting a bunch of screencaps from them. I could just cheat and watch the OVA by itself but this is the one Idolmaster game that doesnt require learning a new language to play so I might as well go for that if possible. Ive had no luck in finding a download for the app anywhere so I was hoping somebody here might be able to help me out.,idolmaster,dcyv43o,3,t5_2t4t4
