6261470,0,t1_cz1b52p,Yes overheads really do punish the low population powers.  That being said its not quite true that replacing  low value systems with  high value systems would leave you in the same spot.  Getting high value systems and shedding low value systems improves your economy over time.The TRULY soul crushing bit is that the standings dont reward this.  Shed a bad system?  It punishes you for it.  th Column collaborates with the ignorant to prep and expand to a terrible system?  The standings give you two thumbs up.  Hey a system is a system right?A power that succesfully held only high value systems until it ran out and only had low value systems around it would be punished in the standings for refusing to expand to systems that hurt its economy.

We aim to break his fingers  every joint  so that both Imperial and Federal systems may slip through them and back into prosperity and freedom.And while our two great nations may not view freedom in the same way we both know what freedom is not.

6719221,0,t1_d0btnhy,What the hell Ill reply.You complain of lame ganking whenever the odds are against you.  Thats serious spin.  We were in the system opposing an expansion.  You showed up with the tags of the enemy that we were opposing.  What the hell did you want?  For us to line up like an old Hercules cartoon?   Its not lame ganking for your opponents to fight together especially when you enter a system and fly around their wing waiting for them to interdict you.  If you have any skill in PvP youll know that actually getting a kill instead of just chasing someone off requires either a specifically catered pvp build rails torpedoes etc. which those merit grinding are unlikely to have or else coordinated effort unless the person who dies is clueless.  Expecting your enemies to respect a v so you can get your youtubes is narcissistic.  Grow up.Incidentally an FDL with prismatic shields two pulse lasers a burst laser and torpedoes is the perfect onevone ship.  Its no wonder you flee from any encounters that arent vs and talk shit about your opponents for not letting you fight them v you actually think youre impressive for winning v with that setup.But then theres the best part.  After all this theatre about vs and mocking us for ganking you showed up later in a gank squad that was happily targetting people  v even when the  was a sidewinder.  So in addition to behaving narcissistically youre also being hypocritical.  But dont worry.  You can fix that in post.  ,ElitePatreus,d0ebqkp,2,t5_38ic5

7529679,0,t1_d2y1tg9,Classic case of cherry picking.  You were held in the bottom three for months and often had long periods without expansion.  Torval and Patreus have each met one or the other criteria for extended periods but never both for extended periodsand its the conjunction of the two that was described as being required to produce collapse.,ElitePatreus,d2y369s,6,t5_38ic5

I dont know where to get an official weekly score from FDev since we have recorded that week differently but lets go with what you are saying.  Patty wasnt in the bottom  then was in the bottom  for  weeks while he didnt expand then got out of the bottom .  Sandro mentioned that Patty was close to triggering collapse although he wouldnt mention any of the specific periods when this happened lets assume it was for these  weeks.  Antal was in the bottom  from cycle  he expanded at the start of cycle  and didnt expand again until week   or  weeks depending on how you count it.  Antal was not mentioned as being close to collapse but Patreus was.Thats what makes me think there is random chance involved.,ElitePatreus,d2yappd,0,t5_38ic5
7915102,0,t3_4nk6ut,It is not about what promises Frontier did or did not make but rather ones personal decision as to whether or not this project is worthy of their own support. Personally I have invested near  AUD in supporting rd party resources for community management and other things not to mention the lifetime pass paint jobs and so on purchased in support of Frontier. It is not an impulsive decision to withdraw from elite dangerous. It appears to me that personal issues are driving specific commentary here. Other groups and players with far greater foresight than us have withdrawn from elite dangerous before on identical grounds without derision from those outside of their own circle and so not understanding the situation. It almost seems that Frontier became a cult overnight and that withdrawing support hinges on blasphemy now. What this is centralised around is the community aspect and competitive nature of powerplay that sustained our group. It seemed worth the investment at the time. My monetary contribution to our community however is insignificant compared to the investment of time from individual commanders. The problem lies not in the fact that Frontier do not feel a priority to further develop and expand upon powerplay but that they cannot maintain it in a standard form in its current state. They stated that they wish to do so and regret the issues but this is in stark contrast with what is actually occurring. It does not matter what the intentions are but whether or not goalstargets can be reached and so far there is nothing showing that Frontier can achieve these things. Our time in elite dangerous has progressed from enthusiasm as to the potential of what is around the corner to a feeling of stasis in a dead end factory job that is a chore and all one can long for is their own retirement that may be a decade away. The only difference being that one is paid for this chore Frontier have created a chore where the labourer themselves must pay for the privilege and have a high rework rate due to poor management.   For a group thats only interest is powerplay sustaining oneself in the game is problematic where the focus of maintenance is on other things. Arguing that we are the minority and so it is not reasonable that powerplay should be sustained to a greater standard is fine but then it is also reasonable that the same minority should look elsewhere to dedicate their time. We have no interest in supporting frontier on a development path that is of no interest to us so lay off the accusations of childish rants! ,ElitePatreus,d45qdwe,7,t5_38ic5
