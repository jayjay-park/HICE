10493652,0,t1_dcxj2p1,I dont really care about items being in weird places I might give it a try but i often get borred with games on normal because they are too easy.,ResidentEvil7,dcxkdbo,1,t5_2vxs5

10529959,0,t3_5qpte8,I was surprised at how easy the last boss battle was but overall the game was awesome! I also picked Mia. ,ResidentEvil7,dd1op20,4,t5_2vxs5
10533852,0,t3_5qu7tx,Wouldnt recommend going from easy to madhouse. You probably dont even have the secrets of defense or the essence of defense ,ResidentEvil7,dd24muq,2,t5_2vxs5
10548550,0,t1_dd3p6o4,So Ive watched the gameplay... but still confused why Mia and Zoe arent as insane as the rest of the family? Did I miss something? And why can ethan leave without being cured???,ResidentEvil7,dd3so92,2,t5_2vxs5
10549867,0,t1_dd3wbgo,I thought Lucas got cured by the corporation to act as a spy of sorts? And from that point on kept acting to fool her? Maybe I read wrong  But yea I keep reading different things about Ethan. Like some people said he was infected cause he was seeing the hallucinations made by Evie which could only happen if he was infected with her mold. But Im like eh it could just be game tactics where you just heal with first aid kits lol. I love this game but man  I just have more questions the more I think about it.,ResidentEvil7,dd3y20y,2,t5_2vxs5
10554577,0,t1_dd463ts,YES Im so glad someone has the same questions as me. I havent found any answers to those yet either ,ResidentEvil7,dd4haph,2,t5_2vxs5

10581976,0,t1_dd75euj,maybe. my point is you dont staple your foot back on and your walking around fine the rest of the game. So idk why the staples were needed in one case and not the other. ,ResidentEvil7,dd7g6iy,1,t5_2vxs5
10584044,0,t1_dd61oxp,Then who do you think that guy is?,ResidentEvil7,dd7nv6g,1,t5_2vxs5
10593188,0,t1_dcwtb4k,Yes Ive played the demo and it was ok but just not feeling the hype.  Perhaps Ill wait until RE is on sale and try it then. ,ResidentEvil7,dd8lt2b,1,t5_2vxs5
10624240,0,t3_5rzsy4,Could you keep walking down?  Is she just stuck there or did she fix herself?,ResidentEvil7,ddbt5ds,4,t5_2vxs5
10632276,0,t3_5rfrn3,Same here. My wife lost her dinner half an hour in. Half the reason we have this game is because she wanted to watch.I killed camera wobble set blood on screen to less  and upped the brightness so hopefully this does the trick. ,ResidentEvil7,ddcmzyc,1,t5_2vxs5
10761834,0,t1_ddptemn,I agree with you that its all strange. I can come up with possibilities but these dont have any evidence Zoe or Lucas would have had the motive and means to transport the Dseries corpses there. As for why the Dseries have to remain in that state? No clue but maybe it has something to do with how the serum ingredients work. The ingredients only properly manifest within the right arm of this particular Dseries corpse and its easier to not lose the arm if you keep it with the body?? ,ResidentEvil7,ddq054m,1,t5_2vxs5
