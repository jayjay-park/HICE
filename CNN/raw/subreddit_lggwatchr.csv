2255200,0,t3_2l133j,Depends on if you are within your  days  if you are an elite member.  If you are just put the watch back in the tin with the little foam thing pack it up exactly the way it was when you got it.  They WILL NOT remove it from the foamy thing to check the back of it for cracks they just want to see it power on when you return it so they can factory reset it if you havent already done so.If its outside the returns window you might be able to persuade them to give you a refund in the form of a store credit  which you then could use to get a GwR.  Again dont show them the back just let them power it on to check its functionality.,lggwatchr,clqgqli,1,t5_337gk

4089011,0,t3_37e72i,if you manage to get into the bootloader you should be able to recover the watch by sideloading the OTA update or flashing the various componends through fastboot.If you dont want to send your watch in I can provide you with some links to XDA,lggwatchr,crmdel4,1,t5_337gk

4150945,0,t1_crtezkq,Krona can be a tad bit difficult to read at first a lot of people say its confusing. But it really isnt. You learn it in a minute and get used to it in an hour or so. After that youll never look back. Tip Make sure to compare the weather on the watch with a weatherservice you trust for your area. Or just use a bloody themometer lol If its off you can change the weather provider between two options in the settings for the watchface in Android Wear. I find that one was off by several degrees here but there other was spot on. ,lggwatchr,crtf6xr,2,t5_337gk
4157952,0,t3_38av35,Can you addremove links from this band? I really want a nice metal band for my GWaR... but I have MASSIVE hamhands and wrists. Im hoping I could buy two of these bands and Frankenstein them together.,lggwatchr,cru7urr,1,t5_337gk

5007011,0,t1_cup69cf,Indeed but this is what confuses people. They think a shower or swimming with it for  minutes is therefore fine as it never gets below  meter.The  meter reference is the pressure at  meter with the watch stationary. When water is blasted out of a shower at it or you move your arms to swim the speed of the water pushing against the watch is the same as having it in much deeper water.Basically you can drop it in shallow water and splash it while washing your hands but I wouldnt shower or swim with it.Also all of this aside water running over the screen triggers swipes and presses. Ive had the water swipe and press in the right places to trigger a factory reset which was more than annoying. Dismissing notifications I havent seen is also a huge problem.Just keep it out of water! Its not worth the hassle or risk.,lggwatchr,cupj7t6,1,t5_337gk

6613864,0,t3_468aw5,Mine has recently developed a few dead pixels about  months after I purchased the beastie. Much as Id like to get the device fixed I probably wont bother. Theyre not too noticeable most of the time with a dark watch face so Ill probably just hold out until I find a watch that I like better.,lggwatchr,d03fh9x,1,t5_337gk
