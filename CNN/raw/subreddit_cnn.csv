11382795,0,t1_dfm54o2,Then you havent been watching CNN at all. I have three televisions on at work that are always playing the news one has CNN one has Fox and one CSPAN. I can tell you for a fact that CNN covers other things and in fact their entire evening lineups Thursday Friday and Saturday are generally devoted to none news programs like Parts Unknown History of Comedy and Finding Jesus. And once again let me remind you top republican officials as well as SEVENTEEN separate intelligence agencies have corroborated that Russia meddled in the election. It blows your mind that they are blaming Trump for it? Are you fucking retarded? He has key members of his administration who met with Russian officials that is fact. No one is disputing is except for Trumpkins. Many of these meetings were kept in secret until the investigations began. Why? Seriously when all is said and done and your god king emperor has to leave e White House in shame youre going to fe like the worlds biggest douchebag. ,cnn,dfm7y7z,6,t5_2s30n
