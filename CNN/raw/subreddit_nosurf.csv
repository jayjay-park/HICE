1333035,0,t1_cijikq4,Ive also noticed something like this. Offline social interaction can satisfy me so that I feel okay while alone afterwards but online social interaction cant. Textbased online social interaction fails to satisfy me for any length of time even if Im talking to people Ive known for many years andor even if Im talking about important and deep personal stuff. Voice plus video chat better but still inferior. Yet despite all this I still crave online social interaction and it may be the main factor driving me to spend time online.I think this is because online social interaction lacks a lot of the body language communication that happens in offline interaction.,nosurf,cijkzrm,3,t5_2st2y
2694825,0,t1_cn9s4fq,sounds like youre adjusting your structure wisely. Ive had similar struggles with training myself to use my bed only for sleeping.The baggage part mainly referred to avoiding coping mechanisms that will backfire  because thats what were trying to do cope with boredom and other feelings we dont want. For me this means avoiding games on my phone. E.g. if Im angry at my wife and dont address it I will inevitably play a game. While I play the game Im not really angry but as soon as the game gets boring and I start to feel the frustration again I have to up the ante. Either Ill start spending money on a freemium game or Ill start hunting for another one. Another distraction is putting on a podcast or audiobook while I play through the boring part of a game. Hours pass. Ultimately I feel tired like shit and ashamed that I wasted so much time. This is a baggageladen coping mechanism for me. Its not as harmful as some addictions but it doesnt actually make me feel any better.A baggagefree coping strategy would be going to the gym or for a long bike ride. After some solid exertion things dont seem so frustrating.Some people paint or read or I dont know what...Im still trying to figure this part out.Ultimately my goal is to feel more confident in my life and thats hard to do when Im lugging all sorts of baggage around in the form of compulsive video game playing newsfeedfacebookreddit checking or my other favorite addiction...apple fritters.More power to you.,nosurf,cnabz8m,1,t5_2st2y

5608516,0,t3_3rxuh1,Thanks for writing. Your description of your situation and your goals is remarkably clear so I imagine you will do very well!gt Ive been reading a lot but must be careful even with reading.I hear you. Ive over indulged in many distractions over the years reading making a hobby of listening to distant radio signals idly wandering around the city at night I cant put my finger on it but there is some common theme of not wanting to pay attention to my immediate surroundings.,nosurf,cwsah94,4,t5_2st2y

6643093,0,t3_46ifci,This is an interesting method. I quite like the idea of having to leave the house if you want to use the internet especially for browsing. However that may not be practical in all cases for example people who work at home may not want to hang out at Starbucks for  hours a day. My workaround is to only use the internet for accomplishing goals. I try never to use internet for entertainment purposes and only sit down to it when I have a predefined goal to accomplish. I will occasionally surf reddit for relaxation for a defined period with that being the explicit goal.,nosurf,d06gbu0,1,t5_2st2y

7801212,0,t1_d3skyol,the current system has all kinds of problems  fixing it is a whole hell of a lot bigger than one person.  ive figured out how to get mine and provide for the people i care about and i think thats about the best anyone can do.and nothing exists in a vacuum.  undo the current system that is pretty damn easy to figure out because i aint no rhodes scholar and something will takes its place.look at human history  how admirable were the states in which people lived prior to today?  ,nosurf,d3sx0qf,1,t5_2st2y

10378649,0,t1_dcim6ju,I think my main problem is I dont feel comfortable in my apt theres too much noise to sit amp read so its easier to go online amp put the headphones on.  I would go to a cafe or library or something but my transit options are pretty limited at the moment.  I might have to just put off the no surf thing til my living situation has improved.,nosurf,dckhfeo,2,t5_2st2y

10963484,0,t1_de91tbh,Thanks I have started getting back into bodyweight exercises again getting into mindful meditation getting better sleeping habits  and Ive also started readingstudying more need to find a way to get more books though via ebooksinternet. Ive also been on redditplaying games less as before but I dont think I can fully cut either out. Maybe its just positive thinking but Ive noticed a minor change already but I will wait till at least two weeks until I really evaluate my changes. ,nosurf,deat158,1,t5_2st2y

11333179,0,t3_61q30p,I believe thats normal thats just how our brains work. We are shaped greatly by our environment by the people around us what we read what we listen to etc. Over time you can get repeatedly exposed to very radical ways of thinking on the internet and you can eventually often unconsciously internalize it as beliefs and these things may affect your worldview and how you respond to things or your mood or relationships. I mean as kids and even as adults we learn by imitating. So you might want to hang around positive and succesful people read inspirational or spiritual stuff or even poetry like Whitman who I personally think has a very beautiful view on life.Or you might wanna try looking into metta meditation. Its a type of meditation where you wish yourself and other people to be well healthy and happy and people that practice it often report higher amounts of emotions like joy and awe and even better relationships with other people. ,nosurf,dfglh56,1,t5_2st2y
11480994,0,t3_63ubfb,It really depends on how long youve been using your phonePC.
