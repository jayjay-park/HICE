5025623,0,t1_crdgh3r,I just came across this. A postdoc and myself are about to submit a manuscript to the Journal of Mathematical Psychology. The main purpose of the paper is to help Psychologists without a strong background of math to use Dynamic Systems Theory DST. We outline a theoretical model of triadic reciprocal determinismcausation from Social Cognitive Theory using a set of differential equations. We talk about how we created the equations had them evaluated by others in the math department then talk about the pros and cons of these models e.g. Deterministic and Stochastic modeling. We then apply that model to simulated data to demonstrate the utility. We do this in both Python and R then provide the codes used. We also go over the issues that need to be considered when using this type of modeling in the social sciences. There are a few assumptions that need to be addressed.The main book the postdoc worked off of was Differential Equations by Courtney Brown. It outlines the process extremely well and provides code for SAS. We decided to utilize R and Python instead they are both provide much more utility. I personally found Chaos Theory Tamed by Garnett William to be more useful. You can likely find it in your universities data base like I did. The book specifically outlines dynamic systems theory for social sciences and breaks down a few semistatic models that can be used. It was referred to me by a Psychology Professor who teaches a course on dynamic systems for graduate students in his department.If you are interested I could send you the manuscript in about a week after we submit it.,mathpsych,curs1um,1,t5_2s61c
