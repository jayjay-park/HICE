4947372,0,t1_cui18vy,gt i think if you would have posted this AMA on the actual AMA subreddit a lot more people would jump into get involved. but thanks for coming out to this specific one to answer questions from the devoted fans!i always kind of think that too. but i figure rather then them setting up their own AMA in rAMA for publicity or whatever being reached out to and invited to stop by a sub full of fans hopefully shows how much we like them and the show. also with a sub comprised just of fans i think it cuts down on the goofystupidoff topicaggressive questions and the fans are more appreciative. plus as fans i think it is cool we get our own smaller and more focused interactions with the people from the show we watch and like.  you also have a much better chance of your question actually being answered here in a smaller sub  and counting though! rather then getting lost in the noise of the larger rama.i dunno at least that is my outlook and why i keep reaching out to the contestants.,nakedandafraid,cui5n3k,3,t5_2y3jy

4992250,0,t3_3ipru7,That finale was just plain awful in every way. I cant believe Im going to turn into the reunion show next week but since its been teased by multiple of the survivalists as revealing important details not shown on camera Ill foolishly watch it thinking that the editors arent going to shape the shit out of that as well.They really fucked up the NampA brand with this XL season. Fingers crossed that they dont do this again when the regular NampA comes back but I worry that theyve found a formula that gets viewers and wont go back. Im guessing the main qualification that theyll be looking for on future NampA episodes is a Greys Anatomy credit.,nakedandafraid,cunr3ff,2,t5_2y3jy

5047068,0,t3_3k366i,You cant possibly see anything on a TV screen and think its not scripted to some extent. I dont have a problem with any produced segmentsits entertainment. However as far as Dani and Honora these two are probably the least credible folks in my mind from this crew so its hard to take anything coming from them seriously. ,nakedandafraid,cuud2l5,29,t5_2y3jy
5056779,0,t1_cuux6jx,Whats stupid is someone repeatedly commenting on a matter that she knows very little about. When was the last time you diagnosed anyone or understood the process of diagnosing someone? I worked in a psychiatric hospital for a decade Im not a doctor but I saw a lot and its pretty clear youre clueless about the process and yet you continually act like you know what youre talking about. You havent the foggiest idea and yet you stubbornly cling to your views. Its idiots like you that make the world such a difficult place to live in. ,nakedandafraid,cuvj6yg,-2,t5_2y3jy

Then the group eats the same fruit and watch Ryans puke video and a couple go down to illness.  I thought it could have been just watching the video that made folks sick.,nakedandafraid,d6skwsg,4,t5_2y3jy

10049528,0,t1_dbhfb0b,Its pretty nuts how both of the people who went crazy were the minority in the  groups. Seems like either the lone girl or lone guy feels like the two are ganging up on them. I dont know if the producers mean it to come off this way but the girls in that show just seemed to be so outrageously crazy. Shane had his moments but the girls in his group would literally just lie around all day in the shelter that he had created for them and complain non stop. Then tell him to take a hike they didnt need him then mooch of everyone elses food and resources. Honora was clearly insane. The trio of girls seemed to be somewhat normal but even had their moments. The guys throughout seemed completely normal. ,nakedandafraid,dbhh96z,2,t5_2y3jy
