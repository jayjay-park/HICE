3931396,0,t3_33la6u,I did a Google search on Exuma fire truck to find out why the island did not have an engine and found this article which was from last December.The article stated that the island received a used engine. Does anyone know what happened to that engine and why it wasnt available for this fire?,bahamas,cr4exmb,1,t5_2rld2
5054016,0,t3_3k4m70,Highly reccommend doing power boat adventure tours to Exuma.The graycliff cigar and chocolate making tour sounds like it would be up your alley.Also try the Bahamian walking food tour and the Watlings distillery tour.As for food....dont buy on Paradise Island you will get ripped of.  Take a short cab to Solomons fresh markets in Harbour Bay. Grocery storeFor fish look under the bridge or at Montague. A cab driver will know all of this.There are set rates so make sure you get the cost up front and always ask the bellman how much he thinks it should cost too.,bahamas,cuv78ar,1,t5_2rld2

11277322,0,t3_60vtk4,Ask your driver to stop by fresh market at old Fort bay shopping center. Its right by the airport. Or super value on cable beach. Your criteria should be whats near the airport. Please dont go wondering around on Mackey street etc. Stick to the tourist areas. In addition there are some bodega type options on paradise island too for your list. Enjoy your visit! ,bahamas,dfa9nsd,2,t5_2rld2
