Im also really fascinated by some studies Ive read about feedback from our gut bacteria causing us to crave the things we regularly eat. Looking forward to enjoying healthy food more and more over time as I starve out those sugar fed bacteria!,sugarfree,coyz3ti,1,t5_2unk0
3621701,0,t3_2ykb1x,I can relate to your first comment about others possibly feeling bad about their choices when Ive made a choice to not eat something sweet. Its just....awkward. Mostly because I dont know what to do with myself. Usually Im the first to dive in. Props to you for putting it out there weirdness and all.,sugarfree,cq53mv7,2,t5_2unk0

6456815,0,t3_43xidf,Things have been going well for me so far. I have been cutting back on cookies cakes etc. for awhile now so not much has changed for me besides replacing jam with fresh fruit in my cereal. I eat an apple or banana plus some nuts as a dessert after dinner. The only thing Ive really been craving the past few days is coconut butter. They dont have it at any stores around here so I think Im going to have to order some online or just make my own.,sugarfree,czn6epv,4,t5_2unk0
6459266,0,t1_cznam9k,Normal amount minus the crappy snacks I usually have.Porridge and toast for breakfast Pitta bread pizzas for lunch with vegetables on the sideDinner was a large helping of chilli with vegetables and rice.Youre right though I probably ate fewer calories than normal. Maybe I should incorporate an afternoon healthy snack although I wasnt actually hungry at the time,sugarfree,cznfjbh,2,t5_2unk0
6505302,0,t3_44ljjj,Concentration how are people finding their mental clarity? I know that when I am eating sugar my focus and concentration suffer and I get a lot of brain fog. I also know that when I am clean of sugar I am far more sharp and focused.My concentration is terrible and my mood bad but I have just done a long stint of many days hard work and so probably am also tired but Im so bad tempered as well. I think it takes me about three weeks off no sugar before my concentration really improves.I have been bad tempered since Thursday. I wish I could stop being so grumpy though. Im not a nice person to be around at the moment and I am regretting a few terse emails I have sent  . Im off now until Thursday and then have leave for a week.  I expect my colleagues are delighted!,sugarfree,czs73pw,3,t5_2unk0
6542448,0,t3_44zy5p,I forgot the biggest staple in my diet my morning smoothie! I drink it every morning and it keeps me full from am until am without making me feel overly full or bloated when I drink it. Heres my recipe approximately  cup kale removed from stalk one large leaf or two smaller ones.  avocado  to  cup of unsweetened almond or soy milk I alternate between the two  scoop of vanilla protein powder I use Kaizen whey protein or isolate which has stevia in it though Im learning more about protein powder types and might switch it up.  frozen banana  cup frozen blueberries  tsp ground flax  tbsp psyllium husk sprinkle of cinnamon and ground ginger small splash of vanilla extract enough water to make it blend usually just fill it up until the liquid level is about  under the rest of the ingredients.The trick to a smooth velvety texture is to blend it for longer than seems reasonable. Ill turn the blender on then go put away all of the ingredients and start making my lunch. Its loud and annoying but it makes a big difference.,sugarfree,czw1iyw,2,t5_2unk0
6663816,0,t3_46v6yl,Still kicking. I feel like this week has been when I became a lot lazier with my food choices like the initial enthusiasm has gone and its more of an afterthought now i.e. oh I forgot Im doing that sugar thing. I didnt eat any sweet things this week but Ive had takeaway a couple of times where Im sure sugar has been added. I guess this meh feeling is probably the breaking point for a lot of people?Anyway Im still sticking with it and if at the end of this Ive broken my bad snacking habits then that is a great outcome for me.,sugarfree,d08lgo8,3,t5_2unk0
7833484,0,t3_4mlhs2,Ive never kept track that closely.  Partly because about every  months I slip up and sneak a single cookie then get a headache and hate myself for an hour.  Thats usually enough to motivate me the next three months or so.  Its great that you have a healthier system than that!,sugarfree,d3wjv3f,1,t5_2unk0

9420990,0,t3_59cxg1,I guess this depends on your interpretation of sugar free but artifical sweetners can be just as harmful as sugar if not more harmful.I looked up the syrup mentioned below and it has sucralose and aspertame.Whatever you decide is fine but if you are focusing on health more so than less calories be aware of artificial sweetners    From what I hear stevia is the safest sugar substitute.  ,sugarfree,d9a6bse,2,t5_2unk0
9471802,0,t3_5agkex,simple answer no you cant because carbs are fuel to the muscle without carbs the body will produce energy burning muscle.BUT.. you can be refinedsugarfree.
