3147882,0,t3_2w5dhb,Regi long time fan and supporter of TSM here. Looking back over your career you truly have accomplished so much its quite impressive. I always was a fan of your style of mid play and wondered what would happen if you were surrounded by the playmakers that are also on the team today I feel that for certain there are more playmakers now than the tsm of old that was pretty much based around you making the plays and everyone else following up. How do you feel you would synergize in the current team set up?  This post is nothing against Bjergsen as he is my other favorite midlaner of all time and obviously he is perfect for the position just curious as to how you feel you would sit within the team. ,TeamSolomid,coo9wgm,1,t5_2t8co

Its about jungle support adc and mid jungle skirmishes since everyones so tanky. Bjergsen only needs to be on par to win. They have great teamplay smart pb and decent to good early gamemacro play. They are adaptable. Its all about preparation for tsm. Their biggest chance at losing is to a team like Uol where cheese picks they cant prepare for come out. And tbh the way the Korean teams use their subs can definitely put a wrench in tsms plans. Thats their biggest obstacle for msi imo even though only  sub is allowed. ,TeamSolomid,cqqykhf,6,t5_2t8co

4402774,0,t3_3bgezt,Going to respond as I read through Ill edit this.  Captain boots are fairly uncommon and if on an initiator anniealistar distortion is a much better upgrade regardless of the macro play. Banner of command more than fixes this issue during the mid game and in the early game making minions move faster isnt worth a quick boot upgrade.  Reksais ultimate is used for applying early gank pressure and later on dragonbaron pressure. When no objective is up in the mid game there is usually not a reason to split push in the first place split pushing is done by top laners at this time  the jungler should either be at the objective or reksai in base about to ult to a tunnel if she had to buy so this point is null and void. EDIT My LPL knowledge is close to  I didnt think about utilizing her ult to split push late game. We havent seen Santorin on reksai recently but I guess the way he uses it is just sticking with the team? We have seen Dyrus on split pushers like gnar a lot to be fair... maybe if we see Dyrus on a top laner that doesnt split and the enemy top laner doesnt either Santorin might do it. Still in light of top lane carries I dont know if this would happen. TSMs playstyle changes as they find out what the current metagame has to offer. During season  there was a lot of different changes made jungle items i.e feral flare trinkets at the beginning tower tankiness which lead to a meta that took a while to develop... basically what made you good then was how well you could laneswap skirmishteamfight or punish mistakes excluding the obvious. But in season  the meta shifted and there are other aspects of the game that are more important. At the moment I cant really tell what they are hell just this week  fast pushing randomly became a regular thing. THE POINT IS TSM is a team that has always changed their playstyle to the meta sooner or later besides focusing on getting Bjergsen fed. Whenever their playstyle shifts they tend to lose some of their previous strengths and hang on to others. Apparently the teamfightingfinding ability from s worlds up through iem katowice is no longer the most necessary ability for TSM to have so they adopted other strengths. Ideally it would still be good to have practiced it too... but right now other aspects of their gameplay is more important to them.  Mentioned earlier it could have something to do with the recent meta change. We seem to be back into this laneswapfastpush thing so very early wards wont spot anything meaningful with all  members always showing on the map. I think this is just you trying to find a critique I cant really find this to have been an issue. Besides I remember Dyrus doing lots of early invades to ward gromp when playing red side. ,TeamSolomid,cslxebq,1,t5_2t8co

4454735,0,t1_csrhbbu,It feels like they plan on replacing Turtle anyways.

I feel like they were SUPER quick to make this move on Turtle though. Everyone has their slumps and although he wasnt amazing last split he was still pretty good. But this is mid split and they hardly even tried out Keith before confirming they wwanted him.

Streaming is only harmful if the player divulges their mindset or strategy while playing talking about how they play matchups or what they think is a counter to some picks.The only way to really hide soloqueue is making a brand new account that isnt used in scrims or anywhere else and only play that account off stream but even then you can easily identify accounts due to key binding rune pages mastery setups champ pools builds and summoner skill order.,TeamSolomid,cudu8vg,2,t5_2t8co

5125743,0,t1_cv3cvlb,True. Im just wondering whether the players not taking the soloque initiative themselves is a good sign or not and whether it means theyre too stressed to do anything else. The high tier teams certainly managed to balance both. For example I know YelloStar hasnt been active much and its probably because he has other responsibilities but the rest of the players are finding time. Plus it seems to build their confidence from an observational standpoint. ,TeamSolomid,cv3ueop,1,t5_2t8co

5273677,0,t3_3n8i7w,There are lots of problems.  My go to point is always to look back at IEM the last time where TSM looked dominant.  In that tourney they werent mistake free but they constantly made plays.  They set the tempo they controlled their games and they didnt just wait for mistakes they forced mistakes.From MSI forward the team looks and plays like they just wait for the other team to make mistakes and even more like they are desperately trying not to make any of their own.  Its why they look so bad its why Santorin doesnt gank like he used to its why they look like they are afraid.Where does this come from? Who knows Regi probably doesnt help in the way he hammers on mistakes constantly.  You have to focus more on what you need to do rather than on what you need to not do.  If you want to get better you look at mistakes but you have to look past them as well.  How do we move forward from that mistake? Both individually and as a team.  Regi in the videos never even gets to this analysis.  Its just you cant make that mistake or dont make that mistake.Thats why Hais shotcalling is legendary you can see it from outside the game.  Did they make a mistake? Well now the shotcalling calls for more active playmaking.  More mistakes? More risky plays with big rewards.  I think the coaching or the focus lately has moved the players towards a mistake prevention focus instead of a game winning focus or a recovery from mistakes focus.  Honestly its hard to watch.  This team would get torn apart by their former IEM winning selves.This is getting long as fuck but lets look at WT.  Not the best ADC as he makes mistakes more frequently than others at the world level.  However look at his career.  He always made mistakes but he also always used to actively make plays.  Often at the worlds level.  It seems like they have coached away some of his mistakes but at the cost of his aggressive plays.It feels like they havent even attempted as an organization to go back and unravel the success of spring and IEM in order to reincorporate it.  Also those hoodies are a fucking tragedy being back the jackets.,TeamSolomid,cvlrt28,48,t5_2t8co
5273793,0,t3_3n8i7w,Trust me Regi would rather get rid of Santorin turtle and lustboy before he lets go of bjerg.. and bjerg knows this.As far as I am concerned all  of them can go to. Nothing against them but at this point they just arent performing. I can see Santorin being kept definitely not a bad player. However at this point TSM needs. a carry top laner.. I think its been discussed impact would probably be an ideal pick. can play a lot of champs. an ADC. sorry turtle is just not what he used to be. I like the guy too but weve had a weak bot lane for a while already.. a support maybe?. I have mixed feelings but I cant help and feel that comms is an issue. Yea his English has improved a lot and his performances have prob been the second best. I dont have that much of an issue keeping him.. but I guess it depends if WT stays.. one thing is for sure I dont think keeping both of em should happen.,TeamSolomid,cvlscap,2,t5_2t8co

5638251,0,t3_3pfkes,Rumour has it that a new Elementz super team will be created with KaSing mentioned as their support. They go both ways but as for KaSings response to the rumours of him going to TSM I think its unlikely he will come. Yes he might have been trolling but so many other EU players commented sarcastic and if you are in the EU LCS you often know a lot of what is going on behind the scenes. Hello guys I am in this comment going to briefly reflect on the roster options for TSM as well as give personal opinions regarding players and performance. Please have a read! DNow I reckon KaSing joining new Elementz is more likely then him going to TSM because according to the rumours he wil take Hjarnan with him. The article also mentions Cabochard as the toplanerI dont like that we are going in for Svenskeren. He has had a bad past and I dont think he is a very good jungler. He has had terrible performances on supportive junglers in the past. I dont like his attitude and I dont like his championpool regarding what he can play to a very good level such as Lee Sin.All the shit HK has dragged TSM through is annoying if you look at it from a branding point of view however I believe in Regi and I believe we are in the right and that this will hurt HK more then TSM. If we do end up getting Svenskeren for jungle Adrian as support and Hauntzer for toplane I will have to say I am going to be a bit dissappointed and no this is not because of the rumors and talk with us getting players such as KaSing Spirit Rush and Piccaboo but its the case that we are getting a toplaner that can be hit or miss I think he will do well in NA but internationally its really hard to predict Svenskeren basically gave TSM their win in  Worlds hasnt had very good performances internationally. We get Adrian who was good in NA. I do not rate him above EU supports such as Yellowstar KaSing Mithy and Vander. In NA he is in the top .If TSM has the goals to win Worlds this team wont do if they dont all exceptionally overperforms. I do understand things take time and I do not write this to complain in any form because I trust Regi but I kind of question our intentions if we are not going for the top freeagents when TSM can outdo most offers that other teams are throwing out.If the roster looked more like this Hauntzer RushSpirit Bjergsen Doublelift and PiccabooKaSing you would look at a roster that has the potential to crush. Now I know a lot of you are saying Piccaboo is  unrealistic and it might be but if you have to some degree any idea of the economic power TSM has I believe that there is many players we think of as unrealistic that TSM has the economic power to give an offer that will heavily outdo their existing one or a different offer. Then it all comes down to wether the player wants to leave his team and move to NA. And without official statements from players we have little to no idea on what they are thinking and what they want for the future.EDIT After Regis new TweetLonger it seems like Svenskeren is basically confirmed. So I guess we will have to hope for the best and hope that TSM will create a video with Sven apologizing to the asianfans for what he has done in the past and that he will never repeat it again blah blah. TSM is good at that stuff and I think some action is necessary if they dont want him to get booed at by asianfans in the future I dont know how they think about him right now but it was a heated discussion after he did it many asian fans were mad.

So you had expected performances for what you thought or hoped since bjerg was the main carry for tsm he had to play a fucking fat damage champ since he played supportive midlaners and wasnt able to pull the flashy plays part of that being champ picks you were expecting more from him regardless of how he did.

The months before they got picked up by TSM they were tied with  with VP or Nip whatever team was doing shit at the time. The argument I am making is I dont trust in Reginald to sign a good NA team. From what I know talking to players is that we will have a shit team. You can praise Regi and trust him in LoL but in csgo he has no idea what he is doing. ,TeamSolomid,cynla64,1,t5_2t8co

6753296,0,t1_d0hp0qp,You sure are optimistic. Considering how TSM performed against TL a week before and three weeks before Im not sure what is the true TSM anymore. It really makes me think that TSM is lucky to have such record. I mean yeah bot messed up but what is the excuse for it? That was an obvious level  spike dl ignored and enemy jungle gank that Sven should have been aware. Sure you can say TSM may do better for bo or  but you can make that case for every team. IMT is number  no doubt. CLG looks solid and too consistent. C looks very strong and fearless. These  have more than good chance beating TSM. TL has a good chance beating TSM as well. Remeber how TSM almost lost against TL? So yes TSM will likely to be shit on by IMT C and CLG on bo than not.,TeamSolomid,d0huj8y,2,t5_2t8co
6754059,0,t3_489838,After more thought I think this split with them screwing up as much as they have is actually a semi good thing. Itll address the issues that will need to be patched come summer split when the games are BOs. TSM has always seemed to shine in BOs like C. All of their games will be watched time and time again by the players and analysts. Hopefully they keep the same roster of players. They just need to be competitive this split and hash it out. Summer split is where well truly find this teams worth. If theyre playing then like they are now then its time to flip some tables. ,TeamSolomid,d0hxd69,3,t5_2t8co

6904170,0,t3_4aalrv,The thing is trying to determine what change needs to be made. Like does the team need a sports psychologist or do they need a life coach to facilitate discussion about the game or do they need someone to set up efficient practice.All we can tell is what is going on in game and it is pretty obvious that there is something wrong with the shot calling. The individual talent is there but that only takes you so far which seems to be about th or th place. Also the supportjungle synergy seems to be nonexistent for some reason we almost never see Sven and Yellowstar working together to get vision control which is another issue in itself as well.Personally I dont think doing an archaic system where multiple people shot call is the most efficient FOR THIS TEAM I think that parts needs to be stressed heavily. Especially given the fact that the main reason YS was brought in was for his shot calling if you do a single shot caller YS with a backup shot caller Bjerg is the most efficient as the comms will have less clutter in them and the outgoing personalities of Bjerg and Doublelift wont interfere with Yellowstars calls. The goal is to have The main shot caller do all the calls but if they might be stumped on what to do next the backup can take over if they know and the main shot caller can agree or disagree. If the backup shot caller makes a call the main shot caller can agree or disagree and the team follows them .Not only is this more efficient in making the comms cleaner but also makes improvement of the shot calling easier to fix if a bad call gets made.It is like that saying from Bruce Lee I think said it where he says I fear not the man who has practice  kicks one time but the man who has practiced one kick  times. How this applied to shot calling is that a bunch of calls number of kicks come from one person the kick then they improve on whenwhen not to do something if multiple people are shot calling the different kicks there are more calls that can go wrong number of kicks.The worst thing you can have in comms is multiple people saying either nonsense or an important call. The only things that people should be saying besides the main and secondary shot caller is wards summoner spells ultimates possible rotations recalls and purchases thats it. Everything else is not important. The goal is to feed to shot caller with as much relevant information as possible.I mean I could probably go on for a long time about shot calling but yea I hope Regi figures out what needs to change since from an outside perspective we have no insight on what goes on behind closed doors. If I wasnt busy with school I could really go indepth I feel about more in game stuff about TSM from an analyst side of things as I dont know how much I would help with the coachingsports psych side of things. I just want to see the team get better and it has only been a down spiral since S worlds. ,TeamSolomid,d0ywnsv,7,t5_2t8co

7030119,0,t1_d1cxflr,Id wish I was cherry picking. But your entire post history does not provide any traces of support. The only thing you do is post hate propaganda about Bjergsen. Youre an interesting individual however. How does one get so full of hatred for a single player? How do you manage to ignore every single statistic opinions and claims from various professionals about Bjergsens performance? He was just voted  in the midlaner by the vote of every player in the LCS. Yet you claim to be more informed. Various people throughout who have been associated with TSM such as Amazing Weldon Woodbuck and Locodoco have all praised Bjergs work ethic and put heavy emphasize on what caliber of player he is many even saying he is still the best mid in NA. Yes even the Locodoco whom you associated a fictitious quote at earlier convenience saying he stated that Bjergsen was uncoachable. Au contraire he actually stated in his most recent appearance of Summoners Insight how much Bjergsen was the only reason the team had any success. Your rationale for blaming Bjerg is limited to the deductive reasoning that Bjerg is the only constant on the team from then to now so therefore he must be the variable holding the rest of them back. Do you even realize how absurd and unscientific this rationale is? Youll have to go back to the th century to find any backup in this ability of yours to conclude on such a vague basis. I dont know which delusion of yours is bigger. That you actually consider yourself a TSM fan or the completely unfounded hatred you hold towards Bjergsen.,TeamSolomid,d1d7v2k,3,t5_2t8co

They chose urgot TSM shat on them rest is history. rd game they played standard composition for their standards before the playoffs and TSM won. Community will do anything to lessen TSM and give props to other team and you should get used to it every fan of TSM has to be ready for that.

7591199,0,t3_4jaf1j,Weldon is right. Think of traditional sports for a second  there are backups for couple reasons to keep the starters from burning out if they need a break to help improve the starters by practicing with the starters and pushing the starters competitively  if you want the job you have to earn it and improving themselves. IMO a CS team just makes sense if you want to do a man roster and I have an idea on how to do it. When you sign the backups to a contract you put in their contract that if the CS team qualifies for LCS that they stay in the TSM brand and get a bonus because they earned the brand a nice chunk of change of course if their contract is also bought out there is nothing you can do but that way there is stabilitycompetition behind your man roster.,TeamSolomid,d352yb3,0,t5_2t8co

7802250,0,t3_4m5688,Hauntzer  regular split was a major factor in holding the games on his shoulders the fact he didnt need sven was massive Playoffs the same again although sven actually helped him more and translated it better into late game.Svenskeren Regluar Split Very lacking in performance of his previous EU showings Playoffs The Sven everyone in EU loved showed up and he was a monster and he made other junglers know he was a threat.Bjergsen Regular Split Bjerg played to as he needed not great but definitely not lower of the pack out of midlaners he would have some games where he showed he could carry then other games he would let DL carry more weight. Playoffs He went full supportive playing on Lulu and similar more teamfighting orientated champions he didnt so much carry with damage but he allowed his team to snowball around him.Doublelift Regular Season very mediocre he showed big flaws in communication with his support Yellowstar the misscommunication was so bad i would actually say they played bottom  bottom lanes last split Playoffs Still not unstoppable clg saw to that but clear improvment and the fact that Doublelift played more towards Yellowstars style of more laid back and not hyperaggressive allowing for sen to also help his lane much more.Biofrost were going to have to wait and see well we are yet to see him perform but I believe from what ive seen on streams of their bootcamp that he synergiess very well with DL in their aggressive playstyle and his thresh is super clean.Going off their last season review my personal review which is completely opinion based I think that if sven plays to his playoff and USUAL self TSM can EASILY be top  along side CLG and Immortals. Im pointing out sven because as the jungler he is like the glue to the cracks If hauntzer plays like he did all last split then he wont need much attention which means sven has more time to pressure midbot while also pressuring the enemy jungler.,TeamSolomid,d3t17y9,-1,t5_2t8co

The support role has always been viewed as a safe role to shotcall from due to the less mechanically intensive early and mid game. All Im saying is that when you have A.

If the players can handle it they will know when theyre strong enough to take the fights and when theyre capable of doing all of the dmg they need to.  Obviously if their shotcaller was a support they could communicate this but I think it helps that split second decision making when the two power houses are shotcalling ready with their cooldowns to fuck shit up.,TeamSolomid,d51ci2b,1,t5_2t8co

8321747,0,t1_d5h9a66,I think its really hard to tell I would say they are pretty close.  The reason Fnatic could have looked so much better because of the dominating fashion they were winning games similar to Immortals but instead were the top team in the league almost like immortals did last split.  The reason Immortals crashed in the playoffs was becasue they were exploited and their style was figured out and they were beaten.  Fnatic was never tested in EU until the finals when they faced OG there one can argue Soaz had a better series than Huni becasue individually he was outplaying Huni.  Then Worlds rolled around and they were smashing teams there until they hit a brick wall.  Fnatic were able to rip apart a unorganized EDG who failed to adapt to the meta and Fnatic looked  unstoppable.  Then comes the series against ROX.  Well...haha  Huni basically was torn a new asshole in that series something he has not experienced before Smeb single handedly shut them down.  Fnatic was unable to win because they relied on huni to win lane and make tp plays in their passive bot lane and gain advantages that way something no other EU team could counter besides OG to some extent.  It did take the second best Korean team to stop them but Fnatic was a very strong team they just failed to compete with the top level. The Korean teams are really good playing towards pressure on the map like a team should and the current TSM is looking like one of those top teams.  To me they look better than the Fnatic of last year.    ,TeamSolomid,d5hrw1h,3,t5_2t8co

Thankfully we all get a taste of just how idiotic he is when he opens his mouth on Twitter. Should I make this post on reddit? Y  N The way they treated Doublelift after his departure from the org was frankly revolting. Aphromoo particularly showed absolutely no class and no semblance of humanity throughout the whole situation. They took a world class midlaner in Pobelter and made him second string to an unknown SidTheSloth looking mother fucker from Korea after he brought them to their first ever split victory! And this is just recent shit I havent even touched on the older rivalry with the ever annoying Chauster and other Hotshotgg fuckery.

Either way it honestly doesnt make sense for DL to say this if there werent some truth cause that would be ridiculous.

8901340,0,t1_d7hl5la,YellowStar doesnt manage his ADCs. Its quite the opposite he fucks off.Yellows strength in S was his roaming plays and deep vision control. It was good in combination with Rekkles whos a passive positional ADC so he didnt mind just taking a step back and farming in lane while YS was absent.Double by comparison is a lanedominant ADC if his support roams too much during lane its valuable time wasted from DLs perspective. Double would much rather have crushed lane harder to convert his laning strength into a lead.This was where we got the synergy problems in Spring. Double would always want to play aggressive and Yellow would much rather impact another lane. It didnt help that Yellows mechanics dropped off the face of the earth this season. Half the time in vs or skirmishes theyd go for opposite plays it was painful to watch.Mata on the other hand... As far as I know Mata doesnt micromanage his ADCs too much. From interviews Ive watched back in S amp S when he was with Imp Mata sounded like he was in control of their lane. However Imp would still make stupid plays by himself every other game. Imp was a very hypey player. I distinctly remember an interview after Imp had fucked up doing something stupid and Mata just said Dont do that again. and Imp never did.Maybe Uzi just isnt used to dealing with leader within the team like Mata. It was pretty apparent that both iterations of Royal that made it to Worlds were centered around Uzi and his needs in the game. Their combination does look sexy as fuck itll be unfortunate if they dont get their shit together in time for Worlds.As for Doublelift... Chauster famously actually used to micro Double hard back in the day. In fact a lot of his frustration surrounding his supports after Chauster left the position were about how they needed to be cued on what they had to be doing in lane. Which is why he loved playing with Xpecial so much it was in an interview probably around Allstars S. Xpecial would do the thing that Double was about to tell him to do. Double would honestly have been just fine if he had been laning with Mata this split its a testament to Doubles versatility and continued longevity as player that he can fill so many niches in the ADC role he just wont be a CopRekkles while shotcalling.You got to the right conclusion bro but your working was a little off.,TeamSolomid,d7htag1,24,t5_2t8co

9113396,0,t1_d876lrf,I gotta agree with them here at least from what we have seen so far from TSM. Most of their losses were due to them being behind in gold and not being able to come back. When TSM is behind then tend to play as though they are ahead and often time they get punished for that.

9152604,0,t1_d8b1st7,There are many kinds of sugars.  Simple sugars like fructose in HFC etc are a pathogens best friend because these organisms simple digestive pathways can easily break down fructose.  Sucrose also called table sugar isnt much more complex since its just two simple sugars bonded together.  On their own sucrose and fructose feed bacteria like crazy and are one of the major reasons for things like bad breath.Honey is good for several reasons.  Firstly it stays sterile and has a virtually unlimited shelf life because it has a low water content.  Similar to dried foods peanut butter etc.  This means youre not consuming any extra pathogens when you eat honey.  Secondly honey has a large matrix of sugars with more than  different sugars detected.  Thirdly and the main reason that honey is good for disease fighting honey is filled with natural antibiotic enzymes.  It literally breaks apart bacteria that try to eat it.Interestingly honey also has a pretty low pH further helping it kill bacteria.  Its still soothing to humans because we can dilute the pH with just a little bit of saliva and make it more neutral.,TeamSolomid,d8c5q4b,2,t5_2t8co

I wouldnt actually be too worried about getting nd seed either ROX definitely hasnt looked as good as they did in LCK super weak early game Hk is decent but not that scary and then SKT prob st in their group but they showed weaknesses too against strong early game pressure and TSM is really good at that.

9857974,0,t1_dasiaq4,To be fair you didnt do the best job of explaining yourself in your initial post and I assumed you were cajoling the people who wanted Pray as our ADC in with said fake and cruel fans. Could he have flopped? Sure and we wouldnt know until we tried him out but considering he still hasnt won a World Championship yet something tells me hes still got the fire and he also speaks decent English already which is something most of the imports thus far have lacked. Even LustCena himself barely spoke any english before he came here the team had to teach him and that investment was worth it at the time. Imagine someone who already knows as much if not more than LuBo coming in off a stretch of being the most dominant at his role in his region which also happens to be the best and most competitive region to our team. Im not saying itd be instant results but he wouldve been a damn sight better than going back to Turtle knowing everything we already know about him and seeing how poorly he has shaped up over the past year away from TSM.,TeamSolomid,dasimk0,4,t5_2t8co

9871474,0,t1_dau9pxp,That is exactly what you are implying and my point is that if you actually consider every NA player that has attended Worlds and their subsequent seasons even those that attended multiple Worlds the only guys that became better were Bjergsen and Xmithie.  Everyone else either stayed the same or looked worse.  So the whole attended worlds as some grand experience level up for future international performances has in reality been meaningless in the bigger picture.Hell Stixxay in his rookie season this past year was probably the most consistently best and arguably outperformed the veteran worlds attendees from NA considering all of their individual games.Sure keep throwing out that argument and ignoring that basically all evidence has proven it to be negligible for many seasons now.,TeamSolomid,dau9ypz,4,t5_2t8co
9878374,0,t1_daur7fw,No one cares about the regular season because TSM has been to every NALCS final and the org itself has said international play is the goal. I judge them according to their own stated goals.DL has improved because he kept practicing. By his own admission this is his first ever major break. Why would you assume he would continue to improve when he is no longer doing the very thing that got him good in the first place? Since when do you improve by NOT doing something? Totally illogical.Its obvious that ADC is the role we should improve because its the only role that decided that they may not want to play anymore. The same if any other TSM player decided to take a break. We would want at least as good if not better replacement.Who said anything about Biofrost becoming a beast? Strawman. Giving Biofrost a weaker partner sure isnt going to help him improve though.,TeamSolomid,dav6beg,2,t5_2t8co

The point of roster swaps is to change the environment and team cohesion which will of course take time and effort. Everyone knows that.

I think that notation has been put to rest.  If some of that could rub off on Froggen anjd Froggen could become more of an economy player and less resource heavy like DL did I think they could be good on the same team together.  Personality wise the two of them fit in my mind.  Theyre both shittalkers .  I think any difficulty either of the players had working together would be a bit hypocritical because the downsides of both players are quite similar.  ,TeamSolomid,dd61bvi,0,t5_2t8co
10589950,0,t3_5rj546,Highly doubt that TSM will be able to pick up the French superteam.. The name TSM doesnt mean too much in the CSGO scene other than being one of the most popular Western LoL orgs. After a few mishaps with the Astralis crew and Misfits crew a lot of the casual fans dont see TSM in a positive light. The good thing out of the whole situation is the Regi interview with Thooorin. Most of the CSGO subreddit agrees that Regi was mostly in the right but both sides were at fault in terms of communication. . To add on top of TSMs reputation within the CSGO scene much of the pro players seemed to have sided with sgares. It doesnt help that Regis relationship with the Misfits squad broke down as well. Its going to take some convincing to rebuild relations with pro players. . The recent ELeague tournament was by far the most competitive tournament in Western esports history. Besides minor roster swaps we wont see any major organizational breakdown. The players that have been dropped are most likely seeking a wellestablished org where they can compete immediately. I think its important for TSM to establish brand loyalty with their future players. So what does this mean? I think it means that TSM will once again have to pick up the scraps that other orgs have left behind. Maybe its best to make TSM popular by getting popular personalities. Maybe we get lucky and pick up a vet that needs a new environment to shine. Maybe we get lucky again and find a rising rookie. But well still be working our way up again from Premier tournaments into majors. Depending on the success of our new Tier  roster this will take half a year to see results. In my dream and somewhat realistic scenario Id like for TSM to. A vet that is serviceable enough to build around not like FNS or Semphis. . A vet that is serviceable enough for Phase  of the rebuild but can be replaced by a Tier  player. . A mix of known young players and up and coming talents. ,TeamSolomid,dd89snp,8,t5_2t8co

11119403,0,t3_5ymcd8,I only got into playing league near the end of season  never saw a competitive game of it before. Then one day during the season  world championship my friend was telling me about how he was going to watch the TSM vs SKT game so i decided to tune in I didnt understand too well about but thought it was pretty interesting. So when season  started i began to watch the NA lcs and being that TSM was the only team i recognized i decided to cheer for them from there i just started to become a bigger fan the more games i watched and here i am today still supporting my favorite team!,TeamSolomid,desdj5z,1,t5_2t8co
11121037,0,t3_5ymcd8,Im way too late to the party here but I used to play World of Warcraft with Reginald. I played League since beta and was pretty good back in the day my peak was  on the ladder shortly after ranked was released so I played withagainst him a little in solo queue back then every once in a while. A friend of mine told me to start playing WoW with him after Cataclysm came out and he and Reginald had a mutual friend so we all ended up in the same guild. For a little while Reginald wanted to try adding WoW to the TSM reportoire and since I was a veteran of the game and Reginald was a huge noob he made me one of the forum admins for the WoW section of the TSM site. We ended up playing WoW almost everyday together for a while and because I was much better than he was at the game he would bring me into his ventrilo channel a lot of the time to ask questions and play arena games. This was all when TSM was in the very early stages of its success and I even remember having talks with Reginald about what we wanted to do with our lives and stuff because keep in mind he was pretty young at the time. All in all it was a cool experience and if I have any regrets its not trying to become even more involved in the brand seeing where it is today.Ive been a fan since then.,TeamSolomid,desk6yp,1,t5_2t8co

11290880,0,t1_dfbr25j,Ok let me spell it out for you. A lot of TSMs winning conditions this split has been Hauntzer snowballing from the top lane. Not necessarily with the Svens help but by either outplaying a gank or just straight up solokill his opponent. However Zig has been the other monster this split. Hes undefeated on his Kled and GP hes like  or something ridiculous like that on carries. Yes there will be a lot of factors in deciding the series as it is a team game but I do think the top lane will be a big factor that can swing the series to either team depending on which player plays better. ,TeamSolomid,dfbszik,1,t5_2t8co

11372086,0,t3_62a5w8,They mentioned theyd already have spent the entire split with Wildturtle so having Doublelift just jump back in would be a jarring change to team synergy that had already been built over the split and also because the goal the entire time had been for Doublelift to come back after this split but having him on TL and easing him back in ended up being something that they were ok with doing Doublelift was ok with doing and Steve agreed to knowing Doublelift would be leaving but he was literally that desperate Steve even put in increasingly higher bids multiple times because he was that desperate to get Doublelift.Besides honestly Doublelifts spot on the team is not guaranteed.  You may argue that he is likely to win the spot in trouts over wildturtle but that is not a guaranteed spot hes just going to get just because. Hell have to earn it and at that point he wanted to come back hed literally done nothing to earn it so why should he just be gifted the spot especially considering it was his decision to leave?  Also why split precious scrim time between them at this point during the split?,TeamSolomid,dfl06km,1,t5_2t8co

11635669,0,t1_dgejkih,Well just wait to watch Bjerg rip C apart with Zed again completely reking their back line while Jensen failed to do the same on Ekko that everyone says is amazing. Also Bjerg has a higher average csd at . Vs Jensens . I actually think this Jensen better in lane circlejerk is just frustrating as as you said hes just far greedier and his understanding of the map and how to influence the game stem from solo queue where crushing lane is good enough whereas Bjerg has learned how to impact the map from years of LCS and shotcalling. Bjerg isnt afraid to sacrifice laning stats to get a roam at a chance of a double kill botlane or play a weaker champion for the team whereas Jensen just sees the missed cs or laning potential. Bjerg is the more complete player and probably will be for a long time. Not saying Jensen is bad hes obviously the second best mid in NA and close to Bjerg. ,TeamSolomid,dgewzeb,6,t5_2t8co

11729380,0,t3_67bw2n,If we had a rotating Top C or rotating MidJungle SKT then Id be more on board with that kind of  man roster. Having to essentially telegraph for bot lane and giving the enemy jungler a huge pointer as to where to try and disarm your advantage doesnt give us any advantage. We already had to play mostly midtop side. Plus the fact International teams capitalize on those mistakes more frequently and more punishing than any NA team does.The only way Turtle is still on this team is either as some kind of positional coach or Sub and lets be honest hes probably hungry to still play maybe Liquid?.,TeamSolomid,dgpk0nu,6,t5_2t8co

11779437,0,t1_dgv7akj,I think a similar but more realistic scenario is that WildTurtle sees a majority of the starts in the beginning rather than a split but that number dwindles as the season goes on. I dont know if well ever see the alternating stuff that C pulled. What I really wonder about is if theyll try to come up with an innovative use for having two LCS ready ADCs. For Mid you could argue champion pool but I dont know if that will ever be the case ADC. For example I have no idea how many champions DL feels like he can play at a high enough level for the LCS at one time. Maybe its  or ? Maybe its a lot higher than that. DL did awfully well with a champion pool of  in the summer split tho.  If in theory that number was only  or . It wouldnt be crazy to see a use for two adcs with very different champ pools. Maybe they swap out whenever there is a patch change because the other has to continue playing on the old patch for competitive reasons. So that the other has the advantage of knowing the new patch better. There are a lot of ways to try to utilize a second strong player. I just dont know that in the end it is worth splitting scrim time to do it.,TeamSolomid,dgv8j5v,8,t5_2t8co
11779895,0,t3_67pmrg,That they loose every game. Bc every time I do they win and the moments I have expectations that they will win they loose. Its a shitty mentality that brings me stress with every series they play but at least they win in the end.
