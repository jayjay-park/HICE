101959,0,t1_ceq0vrt,gtMainstream feminism has a long history of being racist and as a white women I acknowledge the depressing reality that white feminism is an honest and realistic way to describe it.Speak for yourself.  I dont think its meaningful to say that mainstream feminism has a long history of being racist anymore than its accurate to say that mainstream antiracism has a long history of being misogynistic there are some racist or racially insensitive feminists and some misogynist or insensitive to gender issues antiracists but these do not fairly characterize the movement and indeed most feminists white or not are also antiracists.  If you see examples of racism coming from feminists denounce the example and the speaker dont slander every feminist who through sheer accident of birth happens to be white.  gtAlso you cant be a racist person regardless of race. Racism is defined as power  prejudice and being that only white people have institutional power only white people can be racist.. Racism refers to multiple related phenomena.  Your power  prejudice definition is actually unhelpfully narrow because it only considers racism as a characteristic of people with power and prejudice.  Institutions however can also be racially discriminatory without any prejudice institutions dont have minds and hence cannot experience the state of mind of prejudice or they can reinforce race based power hierarchies without any sort of formal discrimination or prejudice.  . It is simply false and reductionistic to say that only white people have institutional power  Barack Obama Clarence Thomas Condi Rice Colin Powell have or had tremendous institutional power for example.  It is instead the case that fewer black people have institutional power than white people.  . However this is rather irrelevant to whether or not someone can be racist it is possible for a powerless person to express racial hatred and contempt and it is only a strained definition of racism that would deny that such a person is being racist.  .  Additionally the fact that a person is for example hispanic does not in and of itself exclude the possibility that they may practice or promote antihispanic institutional racism.  For example a hispanic person could support draconian laws that allow police to harass people who they suspect of being undocumented immigrants  laws that are in effect racist.  Similarly some women are misogynistic and work to uphold patriarchy and male supremacy.  ,feminisms,ceq1f0r,-6,t5_2qhba
109027,0,t1_cequ880,I figured typical use would be a better statistic than perfect use since... its what actually happens. Perfect use is a theoretical that exists in labs for the purpose of discussing actual longterm sexual activity. In any case even the perfect use of a condom is still only  effective that is over the course of a year three out of a hundred condomusing couples will still produce a pregnancy yes I know thats not literally true and how statistics work but you get what I mean. Thats kind of a lot.I dont think its necessarily an injustice to men or anything I think its more a reason why more reliable reversible male contraception needs to be a thing for the good of men and women. Plus it would really put an end to the myth of spermjacking which would be nice. I just dont like the argument well he could have had safe sex I suppose. If people were using that as a reason to deny women a choice that would be fucking appalling and in fact people have done that and it is in fact fucking appalling. I dont think that this suddenly means that men should get to dictate what a woman does with her body I just dont think its a good argument to use.,feminisms,cequff0,2,t5_2qhba

Islam is no worse for women than is Christianity Judaism Mormonism Hinduism or hell Capitalism.And no as nonmuslims we shouldnt stand back and watch.  We should acknowledge and uphold their voices as the best critics and saviors of their own realities. We must acknowledge that their struggles have as much and as little to do with Islam as Eurocentric feminist struggles have to do with Christianity and capitalism. And most importantly we should stand behind our Muslim sisters when they fight for the feminist issues that rightfully make the most sense to them within their own cultures.  It should never be about us saving them from anything it should be all of us standing in solidarity together with our sisters who understand their own realities best leading the way.  Islam can be a beautiful religion that some feminists can find strength solace and legitimacy in just like for women of other religions and cultures.  We need to examine the ways we as feminists uphold oppressive kyriarchical views.  Labeling Islam as bad for women is unjust and does nothing but uphold these views and deny women their agency their right to find meaning and value in what they choose.  There is no contradiction in Islamic Feminism.  No one needs saved from Islam.Edit They are fighting against cultural beliefs institutions and sexist oppression the same as the rest of us.

Mother? Nurturer? Weak? Desperate? Emotional crying? Whore? Wants to get married to a man and have babies? Bitch? Cant make her own money so has to marry a man? Credit card addict? Shopping addict? Likes pink? Squeals if she sees a mouse? Likes housework? Nag? Knows how to get stains out? Multitasker?gtWhatever you add these are all simply labels what gender roles basically are and countless women will vehemently disagree with being pigeonholed into these labels because we know that whats inside us is unique and that the only thing women have in common is a uterus.gtFor that matter what is a man?gtThe boss?

It turns out that in all feminism is hated more than I thought and sex negative feminism IN PARTICULAR is hated way more than I see sex positive being accepted.gtWell telling women how to express their sexualities is totally the point of feminism right? Controlling their kinks is  aok.As a BDSM kinkster this makes me violently angry. IThe hate in this one runs deep.gtSexnegative feminism more commonly radical feminism is concerned with attacking the actions of those who wish to limit womens freedoms.gt.... Fuck anyone who says the sex positivity movement is poisonous. The roots of the movement are to stop slut shaming or sex shaming. Whats wrong with doing what we were biologically born to do? If I want to get boned  consensually fuck anyone who says I cant.gtSex positives are pretty much the only feminists I like pgtPersonally I find the concept of sexnegative feminism confusing. To me part of sexpositive feminism includes being accepting and understanding of everyones sexual preferences including when that preference is to be asexual. If youre telling people that they should be having and enjoying sex thats not sexpositive. Therefore sexnegative feminism doesnt really make any sense.gtNow fair enough radical feminists are way worse than a postfeminist or sexpositive feminist or whatever subset denomination of feminism one wishes to identify with howeverJust some food for thought.,feminisms,cfxhnqz,-3,t5_2qhba

Perhaps there is some laudable goal behind identity libertarianism but the kind of outcome you describe is surely an example of going too far.I think in a lot of ways were actually in broad agreement. Ill just pick up on one other thing you saidgt And neither experience is the same as being a person who was born and raised female.Of course. There are a number of experiences Ive never had.One of the things that has surprised me is that even though those missed experiences seem like they could in theory be a huge deal in practice in my life where I live thats not the case. Its so rarely an issue that its actually weird. At one point I thought it was going to be odd that I would always have to say When I was a kid... while my friends would say When I was a girl... but whats crazy is that my friends dont say that they seem to be surprisingly genderneutral in describing their own past.When Im with female friends we often talk about the present rather than the past but when we do talk about the past Ive always found that we have enough commonalities that we can share personal stories that bring us closer together.,feminisms,cg41rsa,2,t5_2qhba
563600,0,t1_cg3xznt,No doubt this makes me a traitor to transness or at least trans activism but to me these are valid concerns.Using how well people and especially children conform to gender roles as a primary driver for categorizing them as transgender seems like it could be something of a slippery slope.Historically a number of gays and lesbians have been somewhat gender variant as children yet grown out of it ultimately deciding they were fine with their birth sex. Sometimes I wonder if those people had grown up in a more transpositve world maybe theyd have grown up differently and wanted to change their sex.On the other hand if someone ultimately will transition the earlier they do it the less baggage theyll have to deal with so there is at least something to be said for helping people deal early.Ultimately Ive concluded that if a more transpositve world means a few more trans men and women its a bit weird but whatever. There can be multiple right courses for someones life and it may be just as right for someone to grow up trans as gay. If however we end up with more heavily policed gender roles and a more heterosexist world that would be bad so we need to watch to make sure that doesnt happen.

Shit I can name offhand several rock songs that involve hair length being used to determine gender.Wanting gendered thingsactions labeled immature or childishYeah Im sure women who dress up like teenagers in their s dont get targeted for ridicule or humiliation at all just because of their magic cis privilege.Whether or not I have had a specific medical procedureAKA dont consider me a person with a penis just because my penis hasnt been removed!My willingness to risk loss of sensation in my genitalschestThis is not privilege this is a specific inconvenience caused by trans surgerynot by oppression.My financial resourcesMy willingness to accept an unknown amount of health risksMy ability to access treatment that is deliberately made hard to access see .Yes we know its inconvenient to get elective surgery.  Unfortunately many cis people experience similar things especially if their body is especially gender nonconforming.Bodies like mine are represented in the media and the arts. It is easily possible for representations of my naked body to pass obscenity restrictions.Nope.  As a fat woman nope Id bet I see about the same amount of stuff with bodies like mine that I see about trans bodieseven though fat women make up FAR more of the population than trans people.  Whats more when fat women are depicted in skimpy swimsuits and such theyre more likely to get deleted for violating standardsthis has happened on several websites.  Cis people who dont have an ideal body type are also subjected to thisits not an example of class privilege over trans people.I expect the privacy of my body to be respected. I am not asked about what my genitals look like or whether or not my breasts are real what medical procedures I have had etc.This is an example of MALE privilege.  Women are indeed asked these questions on the regular.Wronging me is taken seriouslyMale privilege.Those who wrong me are expected to know that it is hurtful and are considered blameworthy whether or not they intended to wrong me.Male privilege.  Women are afforded no such thing.I have easy access to people who understand that this wrong is not acceptable and who will support me.Male privilege.I have easy access to resources and people to educate someone who wronged me if I am not feeling up to it.You think trans people dont have this?  You think women DO have this?  Yeah I remember how much education men always get when they wrong women and how easy the access to resources and people to educate the men whove wronged me are to obtain.If I am being wronged I can expect that others who are around will notice.Male privilege.  How many women have been RAPED IN PUBLIC while people stood around doing nothing?I expect that a short term arrest e.g. for protesting will not have serious consequences.This is literally not true for anyone.  Incarceration is fucked up and can result in sexual assault etc. even on a shortterm stay.I expect access to and fair treatment within sex segregated facilitiesHomeless sheltersDomestic Violence sheltersDormitoriesDrug RehabilitationPrisonsBathroomsLocker roomsGymsHostelsJuvenile justice systemsYup.  here we gothe one place again where the privilege checklist actually classifies something cis people get and trans people dont.  So this is all about getting access to womens spaces huh?  Because I sure dont see FTM people saying that its urgent for them to be told to use mens facilities.Institutions and authority figures do not force me to adopt a different gender presentation or deny me medical treatment.Parents foster careJuvenile justice systemsSchools all K schools some religious universitiesDrug rehabilitationNursing homesPrisonsHospitalsMental HospitalsClose relativespouse unless otherwise specified in the event of a medical emergencyMANY parents foster parents prisons hospitals spouses etc. regulate and police gender expression of cis people.  A man in a dress is treated with the same bullshittery as a trans woman when it comes to gender role policing.Commonly used terminology that differentiates my gender from other genderssexes implies that I am normal and that I have unquestionable right to the gendersex I identify with.

Its also difficult to miss someone who was never even born or spent any significant amount of time in the womans body.

Victimised sex workers are underrepresented in these organizations because they lack the resources time and freedom to throw themselves into political activism as they are victimised.That  of sex workers are greatly damaged by the work they do is abysmal! In what other industry would people accept that level of harm to labour market outsiders as just some kind of policy problem rather than as a structural issue? Even if it was something like  Id feel queasy but  is ghastly and not something which can be handwaved away. Considering that sex worker associations almost universally push for more liberalised regimes which would increase the amount of sex work and by extension abuse how can we take these people at face value? I just dont see how its at all feminist for us to just nod our heads to a privileged subset of sex workers whilst ignoring both the women who are already hurt by prostitution and those women who currently arent but who would be victimised sex workers under the liberalised regimes these associations want.Its not divisive to consider the damage done by prostitution to be a higher priority than whorephobia.gtIt would be easier to recognize and accept and admit to oneself that this is not a job for everyone.People especially the economically vulnerable and poor very often have to do jobs they do not want to do for the level of pay they receive. Arguing that women who do not want to be prostitutes will somehow select out of being prostitutes in a more liberalised market is the solution to harm and abuse within the industry is nonsense and comes dangerously close to blaming the victims of abuse from johns for their own attacks for doing a job which is not for them.,feminisms,cmigf4s,10,t5_2qhba

So women making these choices are looked down as bimbos considered traitors to their own sex not smart enough to realize they are just buying into patriarchal expectations etc. just for caring too much about their appearance.

Figures range from  in various studies. Study finding  figure referenced here Data really isnt lacking we have a wealth of research going back decades detailing exactly the physical and psychological harm inflicted on women by these industries. It is a situation in which unfortunate generalities based on data can easily and accurately be made. To deny these generalities is to deny that the vast majority of women in prostitution do in fact experience them. The data is here the only question that remains is whether it is morally sound for us as a society to place more value on the rights of a privileged few at the top than on preventing harm towards the vast majority enslaved against their will at the bottom. gtIt seems to me that the primary concern should be harm reduction for the people that perform sex work and that does not include ending what is in many cases our only means of livelihood.There is also hard data that programs such as the Nordic model do reduce physical violence against prostitutes. If one wants to reduce rates of rape serious assault and murder the Nordic model is the unequivocal winner. Regarding livelihood programs such as the Nordic model dont just criminalize johns but in recognizing prostitution as a social harm against women also increase exiting opportunities and assistance. In areas where buying access to womens bodies is decriminalized and treated like any other job we lose the ability to claim any logical reason why a woman would need assistance to exit and these resources lose support and become more and more scarce.,feminisms,d0r82y7,4,t5_2qhba

In some societies like our current situation living as the opposite gender was shamefulfrowned upon but tolerated so long as you performed the social roles duties associated with that gender while in other cultures it was seen as the mark of someone more spiritual or touched by the gods. You can read about the phenomenon in numerous huntergatherer societies around the world as well as a variety of historical and sociological texts. Western society is hardly the be all and end all of human culture.In theory I agree with you that the ideal number of genders is zero ... but in practice I suspect that since humans are prone to pattern recognition bias as well as correlationcausation people tend to look at breasts and think woman and penis and think man. Arbitrary and inaccurate as such broad classifications are theyll likely continue to be relied on by the masses which means as long as people try to individuate through self expression there will no doubt be some form of gender performance since gender itself is a social construct existing in tandem with social constructs like religion and the patriarchy and so many of the performancesbehaviors are subconscious and indoctrinated on automatic levels.

I couldnt bring myself to spend USD on something that from what Ive read probably wont be right for me first off  but will require several cycles to figure out if its the cup or my terrible application thereof while leaking into my undies throughout. And then having to fork out for another cup that still might not work...? Noooo.  If I got monthly periods I might bother trying and its certainly something Ill suggest to my daughter when shes old enough but as it is its not for me. And I think a lot of people overlook the fact that for many women the initial outlay of that much money is a big deal.,feminisms,dfgoh57,1,t5_2qhba
11406284,0,t3_62lqch,While the context and history of the issue is important if youve been pregnant anytime in the last few years it is impossible to believe there is not incredible pressure to breastfeed and very intentional shaming of women who do not. It has been institutionalized into baby friendly hospitals and normalized in mothers groups. Context or no pretending the experiences of so many women are irrelevant or imagined is pretty markedly not feminist. ,feminisms,dfovz8r,4,t5_2qhba
