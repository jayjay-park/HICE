1159926,0,t1_ci039vt,gt If what I assumed were the case i.e. your tool ruined rreportthespammers  he would not have been thanking you! In the situation given in my assumption running with that assumption it is reasonable to assume the admin thanking you down the line would never have happened. So citing him thanking you as a reason that even if my assumption were true it wouldnt be a big deal is illogical and untrue. Would you mind reading that back again and telling me if that made sense? Anyway . Admin post about rts. We change toolbox to work with spam. . An admin thanks us for doing that. . After all that happened you make a comment that reads like this   . Hey did you just change your tool to do stuff that the admins dislike?    . What is your response to that?. Or the way it is phrased it can also read like    . So toolbox is one of the tools responsible for destroying RTS?    . What is your response to that? All I said is that that . should have been the biggest clue that you assumption maybe was a bit faulty. Then you could just have checked toolbox before asking tabloid journalism style questions. So with that in mind I think that responding with meh to either  or  is perfectly acceptable imho.

1453371,0,t3_2asaq6,Some people have an unfounded belief that reddit is for promoting the work of others. When someone posts their own video or other work especially when that particular work leads to the creator making money they are labeled as greedy spammers with money symbols as eyes.One counterargument to that is to look at celebrities who promote their work on rAskReddit all the time. Another counterargument is to look at reddit itself. Reddit makes money via reddit Gold and is effectively making money from the works of others.All in all I feel that as long as people promoting products or services are posting in relevant subreddits AND the moderators of those subreddits approve of the posts then everything is fine.For example Ill use rParkour a subreddit that I moderate.  Sometimes there are posts that link to a brand new shoe that someone designed and is selling. Im not okay with that because the purpose of the subreddit is to share links about the practice and methodologies of parkour not to sell shoes. Its a slippery slope with allowing commercial ads. There are some things that would be very useful to the subreddit that can be bought and sold. If too many people start selling things on rParkour Id likely create rParkourEquipment. Whereas if someone posted a self post listing the pros and cons of certain shoes that would be considered useful information.  Wheras if someone were to post a link to their blog that has advertisements on it thats fine. Blogs about methodologies and training journals do contribute to the quality and integrity of parkour.,modnews,ciygedz,1,t5_2ro4m
1454508,0,t1_ciykzfd,Precisely which is why the admins should not have a blanket rule to govern this issue sitewide but rather allow the mods to deal with it as is necessary for their individual communities.,modnews,ciylj6i,2,t5_2ro4m
1455477,0,t3_2asaq6,Before any solutions can really be considered we have to look at the true scope of the problem. Essentially we want to allow selfpromotion where it is reasonable to do so while still leaving the spirit of reddits community curation intact and avoid undue workload on the admins but In a community this size things like griefing gaming and general abuse provably break consensusstyle moderation Mods can be easily corruptible lazy abusive andor selfserving and there is no easy way to prevent this so leaving the decision to them is a poor choice There is no simple automated method to cull out abusive activityBasically as things stand right now the only good choice to avoid turning reddit into a toxic advertising mess is to stay the course. As it is larger subs already have problems with selfpromotion that can be very subtle and intricate such as the quickmeme situation.I believe it would be possible to open reddit for reasonable selfpromotion but the entire system would need an overhaul. You want out of the box heres out of the box.Phase  moderator vetting and restrictionsAs it stands reddit allows anyone to mod anything. This would need to stop. We would need a code of conduct for moderators and a system in place to more easily hold them to that standard. I would start by creating a tiered vetting system.To break it down the admins would need to vet a small group of users who would be considered power users. They do not oversee any single sub but instead oversee the rest of the system vetting the next tier down and dealing with complaints and situations regarding those mods.The next step would be a larger group of mods who again cannot moderate subs but instead vet subreddit mods and deal with complaints and issues about those mods. These could be called supermods or something.The rest of the system would be tier ranked mods who actually moderate subreddits. These mods would have certain restrictions placed on them based on their tier. For example a Tier  mod could only be the primary mod for a subreddit of up to k subscribers or any number of subs where the total subscriber count is k or below. Further tiers would follow the same standards with a larger subscriber count.The other part of this is that users would be able to submit formal complaints about a mod to the super mods who can look into the situation and remove mod power as needed when a mod has committed actions against the userbase.I understand that this isnt a perfect system and that many of the elements need to be polished but I feel like until we can trust in the mods or at least that if a mod is abusing their power that it will be addressed we will never be able to give them the power to decide on selfpromotion issues.Phase  Systemic ControlsSo now with the mod situation sorted out we need to be able to give the mods some stronger tools to deal with the whole selfpromotion situation. For this I propose a two level black list. Basically a moderator on a subreddit can mark a certain link post as Blacklisted. It removes the post and adds the link to their blacklist perhaps giving them enough wildcard control to block an entire subdomaindomain. If enough subs have a link blacklisted it will be added to the global blacklist.From there mods can choose to subscribe to the global blacklist which will automatically filter everything on that list on top of everything their subs blacklist blocks. Subs subscribed to this will also have the ability to whitelist posts automatically removed because of the global blacklist.To help prevent abuse and give transparency the local and global blacklists will be publicly available. If a user feels that a link was blacklisted in error they can submit a report to the mods to have it reconsidered. The global black list would be handled by the super mods.A mod should also be able to control how often a particular link is posted through simple subreddit controls. For example a link cannot be posted more than once every ltX timegt. It should also allow some level of oversight on near matches as well. This would cover for example someone posting multiple articles from their blog. They could set it to allow near matches report near matches but allow them to post or automatically remove any near matches.Phase  Community EmpowermentOkay so now we have some good mods and a few tools to help them control content on their sub. The final phase is to put some of the power back into the hands of the regular users. Allow them to report spam but have the spam reports go to the subreddit mods or send an alert if the number of spam reports exceeds x number. Allow them the visibility to see what is being blocked on their subreddits. Hell give them the option to see any posts that have been modremoved.Im off for the night but Ill happily defend my ideas here tomorrow so feel free to post Ill have all day to argue.,modnews,ciypwob,0,t5_2ro4m

He and his fellow developers have their own subreddit for making announcements discussing the game etc. Its basically the official forums for the game.This is me basically. I mod rRodina only because I made the game and the subreddit for it.I chose to make a subreddit for my game because having been a redditor for a long time I knew the power of reddit and prefer the way it presents discussions over traditional forums. I was wary of breaking any rules but I saw a specific mention that you could make a subreddit for your project so I went for it.That isnt the ONLY reason I use reddit by far but its definitely an important resource for keeping in touch with fans. Id be deeply disappointed if things changed and my subreddit was banned or something.I also dont really think Im doing anything wrong or sketchy.

2543820,0,t3_2os55i,CSS junk as far as I knowa. Inspecting the elements in chromefirefoxie should tell you the class or id of a particular element. From here you can pretty much just do the code for that particular item with CSSHow to do that Right click part of the page click inspect element for chrome or firefox or use f in IE. use control b to trigger the element selector in IE dev tools. edit This will let you click part of the page in IE to tell you what the corresponding html code is.For reading materialand Now for the relevant code stuff.For instance    ltdiv classsidegtis the html code for the sidebar. not all of it because that would be large but just enough to see the class for it.From here you can determine that the class is Side so when you want to use css code that will change it you can just reference that.you can either use it with the element div or by itself and both should work.code    div.side           backgroundcolor pink     or    .side           backgroundcolor pink     This code will change the background color of your sidebar to pink. It wont look pretty but it will do that.Class vs ID does matter because they are syntacticly different in css and I never remember either.That said you can probably google how to do either of them in css if you forget I recomend mozilla dev network for all the cool info.Basically find the css property you want to use e.g textshadow and then find the part of the subreddit you want to change. If you need ideas or want to see what other people do use aboutstylesheet on a subreddit like rmuricaaboutstylesheetTo be reasonably good at css you should probably use developer.mozilla.org and webplatform.org as good resources but this post deals with subreddits specifically.edit Now for an actual example of what you can do with css    .mdafter       content YEAH!

I had a large part in implementing digital signatures as a developer some  years ago and when I read esignature above and I just got my hopes up thinking there were someone else that was doing the same thing.Here is a link to explain what is an electronic signature in Europe  and the relevant legislation  from .EDIT  I was probably wrong about US law. Bill Clinton singed the ESIGN bill into law on June    Title . It baffles me even more how signing with a picture of a signature is considered legal given that it can be trivially forged. EDIT a I cant find any definition of what a digitalelectronic signature is in that document...

Is there any plan to put some kind of one line header on subreddits for links to rules descriptions etc?,modnews,deldd6v,14,t5_2ro4m

11070224,0,t3_5y33op,gt Respect the Platform. Reddit may at its discretion intervene to take control of a community when it believes it in the best interest of the community or the website. This should happen rarely e.g. a top moderator abandons a thriving community but when it does our goal is to keep the platform alive and vibrant as well as to ensure your community can reach people interested in that community. Finally when the admins contact you we ask that you respond within a reasonable amount of time. I see the ban on blackoutswe can take over any community at will rule stayed. It seems pretty obvious that theres been very little consideration for the objections raised in CommunityDialogue just who are you trying to fool here?,modnews,demssl0,26,t5_2ro4m

11073471,1,t1_demzv5b,gt This is ridiculous and divorced from reality. Moderators should not have to be concerned that not putting up with the rude shitheads that make up the majority of our interactions will result in an Admin swooping down to remove them from their position. Unfortunately its quite often the mods who behave that way. I detailed some very severe behavior of this sort hereAnd others shared more in the comments. There are a bunch of subs some quite big dedicated to rampant mod abuse and terrible mod policy. gtUntil I see a paycheck from Reddit in my bank account it is not appropriate for Reddit to dictate my behavior as a moderator to this degree. Mods have the ability to make the site unusable for large sections of people such as people who come here to share amp discuss certain topics only. So there absolutely needs to be globally enforced rules like this. gtShould we start publishing our entire AutoMod ruleset now to comply with this nonsense?Yes. In my opinion the only valid argument against that is fighting legitimate spammers. To be honest you seem like exactly the type of mod that these rules are needed for. ,modnews,den61xy,0,t5_2ro4m
11075906,0,t1_demyvsp,ltrantgtrimaginarymonsters allows xposting but the mod doesnt want xpost subreddit in the title. rmoescape allows xposting but apparently you have to look out for your posts being removed because that means someone reported them and now you cant xpost anymore until there arent any xposts on the subs front page. None of these things are mentioned anywhere in either the subs sidebar.Hopefully this mess will be less messy in april when I can report mods for removing stuff first and then thinking about putting the reasons why up on the sidebar. Though to rmoescapes credit they were a lot more reasonable about it than rimaginarymonsters where I was banned for like half a year for a different unwritten rule.ltrantgt,modnews,denfzqj,3,t5_2ro4m

Its only a problem if the admins start giving them heightened promotional ability.Second I dont think this update is intended to solve the problem of power users assuming that this is a problem in the first place.

11253826,0,t1_df6ku76,My concern is that this is exactly the same as far as I can see unless Ive missed something as creating your own subreddit. For example I use rtheonefoster set to private for my own stuff but Ive seen many content creators who just have their own subreddit usually set to be the same as their username. How would this be different? They could be the sole moderator or invite friends to be mods and they could restrict submissions so only they can submit but everyone else can comment. Seems exactly the same to me.,modnews,df7lrj8,2,t5_2ro4m

11556362,0,t1_dg5n0m3,Thats not what Im talking about here. When a moderator removes a post the post is still there but is visible only to the original poster and the moderation team as youve described. Im talking about userdeleted posts which are gone forever. Even the records on the mod logs are compromised. This is problematic because there are no native tools on reddit for tracking users who do this  you have to resort to thirdparty tools which are not available on all platforms and could break at any time if Reddit decides to change the site. ,modnews,dg5x1ic,1,t5_2ro4m
