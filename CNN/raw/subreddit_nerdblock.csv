2119397,0,t3_2j827r,I signed up this month specifically for the Deadpool stuff but at  a month I cant say how long my sub will last.  I mean being guaranteed a shirt which can run anywhere between  and  retail is nice but I dont know if I find it personally worth it.  I will find out when my block arrives.,nerdblock,cl97z7r,1,t5_2yffn

2737623,0,t3_2qlxb6,Having been subbed to loot crate the last two months  I regret not going for nerdblock instead.Loot crate has been a joke  over hyped and terrible customer service ffs they have taken over the subreddit and remove anything negative.Ghostbusters exclusive!!!!  .... Paper door hanger,nerdblock,cnf983l,2,t5_2yffn
2869178,0,t1_cnu6zsg,Oh! sorry I  must have misread. Actually I have no personal experience but a friend of mine had to email them to  different accounts and wait more than a week for them to answer. But if  they dont answer there are other ways to cancel your subscription,nerdblock,cnu85uv,1,t5_2yffn

3968223,0,t1_cr8lw99,I know what you mean. Mine just registered with UPS yesterday and gives the th at its earliest delivery date. So Im still gonna have to wait a week. Its a bit disappointing but considering I only signed on for a month Im not too irritable. I was just worried it was never going to come.,nerdblock,cr8m0hw,1,t5_2yffn

4448115,0,t3_3bk98i,Honestly this was my first disappointment with Arcade block though Ive only been subbed for a few months. ive had other monthly box subs in the past so Im not new to this only to arcadeblock    Max Speed Watch Total whiff for me. I guess its suppose to tie into racing games.. ? I mean its a cool idea and all but the only type of car games I like are destruction derby ones for the laugh or mario kart and mario kartesque .  Not to mention the damn thing is HUGE. Im a woman and that thing makes me look like a little girl wearing daddys survival watch.  I ended up giving it away to a man and it still looks fairly big even on him.Side note Its a bitch to read. You have to read the  different parts of the faces to get the time by.. counting dots. Not even kidding. Its a neat concept but incredibly impractical and I feel bad because the person I gave it to feels obligated to wear it lol. Shirt This was okay. I actually had a lot of fun back in the day on Team Fortress   but it actually took me a solid minute or so of staring at it figure out wtf it was suppose to be. I like old school game art styles and I like TF so in theory this shirt should be awesome for me. Even the little tag line stuff was clever and neat. But it was just .. too busy for that style? I dont know. Ill probably still wear it I have skirts that match the primary colors so it works but its not an OmgThisIsAwesome shirt like last box  .  Coexist Bumper Sticker Another complete whiff. Wat even r this. Seriously though this looks meh its application is meh not too many people use actual bumper stickers anymore given how hard they are to remove and really even as bumper stickers go this one is kind of very lack luster. I was actually really dissapointed that this was an item. It feels like a really cheap after thought and like something LootCrate would throw in as filler. Theres a reason I dont have my lootcrate sub anymore after a year of them.  Portal  magnets A hit! I really enjoy these. I loved Portal and Portal  and Ive been wanting to get some more portal or apeture merch. I dont have anywhere for these to go just yet but we are planning a mini fridge for our gaming den so theyll get a spot there for sure! Until then theyll hang out in their case on my desk. I really like them. Retro Magazine  More magazines .. ? Another item that feels like filler  . Not to mention Ive seen a lot of people subbed to this block that are already subbed to quite a few of the magazines sent out. If I wanted magazines Id sub to magazines  . Anytime I want to learn about cool stuff game stuff retro stuff etc etc I find online sources. Its faster easier and less clutter. I find anytime a magazine is added to any box subs it just feels.. weak. Another item for this block that is worthless to me. Metroid Print This was alright. I loved Metroid as a kid and when I found out Samus was a ladychick it made me really happy as a young girl we didnt really have game role models that WERENT damselsindistress so this was bitchin for me growing up so I was excited when I realized what the print was. I get the restrictions for the size but it was still a bit of a dissapointment given how they were toting on about a Metroid item. In the end though I love new obscure art based around things I love and a big part of why I signed up for ArcadeBlock was to collect new.. well collectables! And art is always a cool way to collect a beloved game.Over all Im still pretty disappointed with this. Only  item did I really super love  I liked  I felt indifferent about and  I did not like at all  and ended up giving away due to being useless for me one of which was the main item.Id say Im sitting at  around  .This is a pretty weak box this month even compared to some of the other boxsubs Ive had. But Ive loved every block that Ive gotten before this one so lets hope this was just a fluke and next month will rock ! ,nerdblock,csrdcq0,3,t5_2yffn

4744099,0,t1_ctsavpr,Actually looked at mine and its the same.  for the shirts fat bloke size . for each other item. Just got lucky with the customs I suppose.Thats a pisser.Looking at the latest Comic Block and an old Horror they do list the shirts at close to ShirtPunch prices  . not as fat fat bloke size.So yeah. Normally a block is listed at  summut bucks this time with the bonus shirt  summut. Wish I still had me older boxes knocking about so I could see what the labels said on other double shirt blocks.Sorry the customs bods picked yours out matey. I still hold that the labeling is wrong. The cost declared on the form should be how much the goods cost you not including shipping. They fucked up far as Im concerned.,nerdblock,ctsje8n,2,t5_2yffn
5169855,0,t1_cv5shjb,Doesnt surprise me LC had a falling out. Thats probably another reason they are holding on to their exclusives since they probably wont get more after that. If NB gets them inside whatever I get both lol,nerdblock,cv95oyo,2,t5_2yffn

6216867,0,t1_cyvt1wl,Thanks for the update. Mine also updated today with arrival at the hub in Richmond. Should be delivered tomorrow.Its still weird how our tracking never tells us when it is actually shipped. Just the initial electronic information submitted and then nothing until it shows up at the local hub.,nerdblock,cywahmk,1,t5_2yffn
6258612,0,t3_3zs61v,Convention freebielevel tier and paper trash.  Nothing all that great about this one except I did enjoy the art on the cards.  The quality of the deck is pretty bad though.  Only thing of any real value were the TLOU Titans but Im really not a fan of this style of figure.  .,nerdblock,cz11ahk,1,t5_2yffn

6603204,0,t1_d029kl0,I had to debate with the customer service person as to what they should do. Originally she said they would be willing to send me out a new shirt either on its own or with my next box. When I said yes please they sent me a message saying theyd give me ten dollars off a shirt punch order. Which just is in no way good for me. So I said no thank you couldnt I just have what they offered in the first place? Eventually they said theyd send me out another deathly hallows shirt. So well see what happens.   ,nerdblock,d02bqqv,1,t5_2yffn

8191112,0,t3_4ri7qp,So far I really like Scifiblock...its been fairly consistent.  Overall the nerdblock classic and scifiblock seem more thoughtfully curated than lootcrate which at least for me seemed like a way to dump clearance and overstock more than an actual curated sub service.  I also get Bambox which so far has made everything else pale in comparison.,nerdblock,d51fv8x,3,t5_2yffn
