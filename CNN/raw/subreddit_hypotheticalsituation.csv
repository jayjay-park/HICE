742744,1,t3_22ntup,Peace. Total and pure peace. If your neighbor has a new flat screen and youre jealous you dont have to kill him you simply go get one from the local store. Work would still exist for at a young age children are taught that to have the things we have we must work to create them. Hunger? No problem. Have a big family and raise a farm at no cost to you besides a little hard work. Stress? None. You can easily take a day off and not be missed for there would be a plentiful supply of workers. Hell stress would exist for people who dont work because they feel as if they arent contributing. If you were to take money away from the world and induce labor based rewards and give everyone the opportunity to live like kings then there wouldnt even be any true anger. Crime? Maybe. But since evetything is free why steal? Why murder? You dont owe anyone anything you cant do anyone wrong. If you destroy property all you do is go pick up another to replace it. At no cost to you. Now heres the downside. Gratitude would slowly fade to nonexistence. Only graditude for the work put out by you and I for the things everyone enjoys. But that fancy car in the driveway? Lets say someone totals it. Oh well go get a new one. That  if there was money involved TV fell off the wall? No tears except over missing your next episode of QVC to see what else you can add to your collection. And to dig the rabbit hole deeper doctors would slowly die out. You get sick you either beat it or die. Primitive ideas of health. Why would you take  years of your life to be a doctor if you dont have any real reason to? Everything is free and youre selfish. Good samaratism dies. Chivalry is dead. You see a man die in a car crash. Oh well he should have gotten the safer car over the cool one. You see a man who is deathly sick. Stay away I dont want to die because you cant stay healthy. Obesity? Sickening. You should work to help repay what you own. As time goes on laziness slowly runs rampant as people begin to realize they have all these new toys and no time to play because they work to supply it for everyone else. Why do you care? Society crumbles. Millions die of disease and organ failure. Hunger begins to run rampant as the hoarders take over society. No one is angry except the ones who are being screwed. And then the cycle beings anew. Peace crumbles riots spread. Desolation. Greed. Life. Death. But no one cares. ,hypotheticalsituation,cgopec4,0,t5_2uccy

If its the first one theyd resort to diplomacy and they might be successful. They could increase the administrative duties of the Holy See use this to justify increasing the number of people there and use this to create an excuse to ask for more land. They might be able to buy a larger piece of Rome from Italy.Italys GDP is about  trillion and the Catholic church is believed to have an operating budget of around  billion per year so if theyre willing to pay they could probably get a lot from Italy. Still I dont think they could do much better than convincing Italy to move their capital and taking over Rome. Italy isnt going to sell Italy.If they dont mind losing their existance as a contiguous country they could try to establish a small presence in each nation. Since they no longer have a particular reason to buy cities of political and historical importance it probably wont cost nearly as much.If they actually want an entire country to themselves it will get harder. One strategy would be to convert a dictator and get them to donate their country to the church. This wouldnt be easy but it would be doable. Unfortunately it will also turn public opinion against them. Theyll lose members and with it tithing. Hopefully theyll get a country rich enough to make up the difference.Another thing they could try is operating in secret. They could topple governments and replace them with puppet governments.
