4922651,0,t1_cuf18ny,depends of the rooting method if it was done through Odin I believe the Secure Boot process might be flagging that. Waiting for people to test it and confirm though.,ledgerwallet,cuf1e7v,3,t5_35ity

11310004,0,t1_dfdyq9c,Im not in a rush to spend my money I only sent a small amount as a test. Im just trying to figure out if the ledger infrastructure works before moving the rest of my funds to it. I dont want to have to rely on MEW over the long term. Do you not have an idea of what could be causing my issue? Im sure Im not the first person to have had this problem?,ledgerwallet,dfdyzow,1,t5_35ity
11486990,0,t1_dfy1hzt,yes we do but BIP  is not exactly normative for Ethereum so different paths can be used. In that case the software interacting with the hardware wallet needs to provide the right path  its a minor change in any case.,ledgerwallet,dfy1rrh,2,t5_35ity
11686930,0,t1_dgkp6bx,Not sure what secondary pin you are speaking about.When you access your Trezor you are asked for a pin number and after that for a passphrase. If you dont enter a passphrase and just click on ok then it opens your default wallets. If you do enter a passphrase then it opens the wallet corresponding to that particular passphrase.To recover your Trezor all you require is the  seed words. When you recover the device you are asked for the  words. You enter this as requested and afterwards your device and all wallets are recovered.Then once again to access the default wallets you enter your pin and a blank password. To access a passphrase protected wallet you enter the pin same as above and then enter the applicable passphrase.There is no place in the setting or anywhere else where you set the passphraseth seed word. You just enter it when asked for a password or leave the password box blank if you want to access the default wallets.,ledgerwallet,dgkqbub,1,t5_35ity
