1718845,0,t1_cjvpxyi,Though I love the theory of cooperatives Im pretty ignorant as to the laws regulating cooperative capital organization in the real world. The little bit I have educated myself thus far seems to uncover inappropriate structures imposed as a result of trying to recraft regulation for corporate hierarchies stretched out of shape to poorly accommodate interest in cooperatives. It seems decidedly bent on hamstringing a truly cooperative arrangement. This seems to lead to a distortion of intent. How do these coops reach the point of becoming bureaucratic tyrannies? Why hasnt the organization split into relevant sized organizations that are federated under core values?,cooperatives,cjvtngu,2,t5_2rbmr
1719329,0,t3_2e3ckj,This doesnt seem like a real coop if management isnt communicating the decision process to the shareholders. Furthermore its pretty selfdefeating to have a consumer cooperative that doesnt include the workers.,cooperatives,cjvvuqz,4,t5_2rbmr
