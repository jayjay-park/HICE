5690169,0,t3_3t27z3,TLDRIm glad I finally got to hear the hype on these little speakers. They sound nice for the price play pretty deep look good enough and are well built. Anyone who already has them should feel confident in their choice. If digital EQ is your thing then they take to that very well and you can get some very impressive results.  I still like other speakers better but they are also just a bit more expensive.,AverageJoeAudiophile,cx2f5o0,1,t5_35kfx
