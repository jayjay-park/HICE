2528553,0,t3_2om5do,Being sort of new to Reddit in general I am not sure about ways to grow the subreddit or to improve it. But what might be fun and could possibly help is a competition themed around the Holiday Season. So maybe we can post a word or a quote can and vote and first place can get featured or something.

9687295,0,t3_5ctyuy,This actually brings up an interesting question that has probably been debated before.Are there any contextual clues that should be used to tell the reader how it is orientated? I could see being handed a sheet of text without a header or footer and not being able to tell where to start. I could probably figure it out after trying to decipher a few words in each direction.Are there any texts that you have found that make sense when read from different directions?
