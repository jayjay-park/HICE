16841,0,t3_1u9w3j,I think there are different typeslevels of helpdesk jobs. I work helpdesk I have an assocaites degree and  certs ASec and Windows . My wrk phone almost never rings. I spend most of my time setting up new PCs installing software creating new Vms in VSphere setupinstall switches patch panels cable terminating user support printing Excel PowerPoint...  hardware troubleshooting and replacement phone setups making diagrams writing scripts to automate and more... More or less I am the systems Admins bitch. My job is more of a jack of all trades helpdesk type position. OPs job seems more like a first level phone tech support type job. Maybe you need to find a jack of all trades helpdesk job. This way you get exposed to lots of stuff. ,computertechs,cegcnas,1,t5_2soz7
102055,0,t1_ceq0u0m,As a system engineer for an MSP I think Im doing pretty alright.But if youre talking to a customer on the phone about one thing and doing administrative paper work youre going to screw up.Im not saying only work on one computer at a time Im saying that you started updates on a computer boom move on to the next thing while that does what it needs to. You can have multiple computers doing multiple things because thats fairly straight forward.Dont try to fill out financial data while typing in commands on a repair while on the phone with a customer who is not related to either or. Youll either say something wrong write in the wrong information or just wont get the computer to do what you need it to do because you cant focus on the task at hand.OP said that he has trouble. So you slow down until you until you can get to a pace where you can do everything you need to do without screwing up. For me that meant when a customer called me I stopped working on computers for the duration of the call because I know that Im going to have to look up something about their order or answer their questions. Phone calls are about  minutes at best. But when I was actually repairing I worked on  or so computers at a time and got them all running what ever scan update installation that I needed. During those wait times I moved on to another computer till one of the above took over.,computertechs,ceq1t6n,2,t5_2soz7

I do server work and when someone tells me they understand and then causes me a couple hours of clean up it is frustrating.  It doesnt hurt to Google things but at times you can run into custom in house stuff that wont be on the web.Take notes on things you are learning. There have been too many times I have trained new people only to have to do the same thing again the next week and the week after that just wastes times on both sides if you have to be trained in the same things over and over. Dont be afraid to take on something new. If you can show that you are willing to learn and are willing to put in the extra time and effort to take on new products or jobs it can serve you fairly well and make you a very valuable member of the team. These are the things I learned in starting out in tech support and it has been a boon to me over the years. ,computertechs,cfja1oa,1,t5_2soz7

I had . beta x installed with an icon pack and Tron updated it to . leaving the beta version installed. That caused my compressed files to be unable to open and the icons went back to default. I had to uninstall both and reinstall the program and the icon pack again.Im guessing it may have done the same with Adobe Flash and Adobe Air since I was using beta versions aswell.

3061017,0,t1_cof7nke,I love me some SnappyDriver but theres a few very very tiny things Ive noticed after daily usage doing enterprise desktop support. this applies to other similar driverpack setups too Manually installing video drivers doesnt run WinSAT thus the system doesnt have a WEI score assigned to it. So when setting up Vista and Win you have to remember to go refresh the WEI score. In Win and above this doesnt apply the new WDDM runs an accelerated GUI at all times  Why does this matter?  New users that log into a system are defaulted to the basic nonAero theme when Vista doesnt have a WEI score. Not a super huge deal especially if its a singleuser machine but this was something I noticed when imaging lots of machines for common areas where lots of different users log in. If updating bluetooth drivers with SnappyDriver Ive seen several occasions where newer driver it installs gets the device stuck.  BT device is flagged in device manager cannot start etc.  So if the Windows base image has a driver or if one gets pulled from Windows Update I just leave well enough alone when it comes to Bluetooth.  Or if you dont want to run on the generic BT stack at least get the drivers straight from the manufacturer site. Touchpadaudio drivers. On  of systems you wont have a problem.  But for some newer Dell Sony and a few other systems the touchpad amp audio drivers that things like SnappyDriver DriverPack Solution etc install may not quite work correctly since the manufacturer has a driver package with extra software that the device might need for specific functions.Examples for  Sony Vaio laptop install Realtek audio driver from SnappyDriver and audio is superlow volume port detection doesnt work. Audio driver may BSOD. Upon removing that driver and installing the one from Sony you see that it installs not only the audio driver but also a Dolby software device and some extra software for controlling audio. After that everything works sounds great and runs fine amp stable.Or install Synaptics touchpad driver from SnappyDriver on any new Dell XPSPrecision ultrabook. Postinstall the touchpad is too choppy multitouch gestures dont work missing the SynapticsDell Touchpad entries in systrayControl Panel so you cant even adjust the settings. Remove it install touchpad driver from Dells site and everythings aokay!Or install Realtek or IDT driver from SnappyDriver on a new Laittude E. Audio jack detection doesnt work no Dell Audio or Realtek HD Audio Manager available in Control Panel. Remove it install audio driver for that model from Dell website.  Now jack detection works fine and youll see Dell Audio in the Control Panel.TLDR  Use SnappyDriver only let it install missing devices dont touch bluetooth if it already is running and if its a really new system get touchpadaudio drivers from manufacturer site dont forget to run WinSAT on Vista.These may be minor annoyances for someone like me doing inhouse support that we can fix with a quick visit worstcasescenario.. But for you guys doing independent onsites amp inshop work these may be the difference between a happy customer potential bringbacks and sour opinions about your work for something so seemingly small amp unimportant. e.g. you worked on my laptop and it broke my headphones!Remember fine details test things before you declare it done!  ,computertechs,cof9s3s,11,t5_2soz7

3116093,0,t1_coklg5m,I love Anker as a company. Their customer support is second to none. Ive looked at buying our aftermarket batteries from them but the price has never been right. Im fine with paying a premium for a good product with good support but for what they charge I can usually buy an OEM battery from eBay or somewhere similar. If it were my own PC Id buy Anker. But a lot of my clients only want OEM. Even if the warranty is a pain in the ass. I have tried a few times to explain that a wellmade aftermarket is just as good but it never seems to win them over. I generally recommend Anker anytime theyre an option for what its worth.,computertechs,cokzdqy,1,t5_2soz7

4094985,0,t1_crn0hsz,USUALLLYYYYY businesses that can afford legit AD will have a sysadmin to maintain it but you should probably do a three part exam. the first part is have them install a server os and deploy a domain with x amounts of users x shares etc then on part two disable a user account and or other common scenarios like dns requests not functioining etc having to create a new user and then a third part where they have to ts a local printer thats shared on a workgroup a file share that isnt connecting and other such common issues. Thats JUST the basics nut if youre supporring AD odds are youre also going to be supporting VLANs and websites as well and exchange servers as well or other forms of servers. if youre a mom and pop shop and you find someone that can do most of these things imo youre going to have to ask yourself whats wrong with them. someone that can do that that is looking for a most likely lower paying position is not a normal situation. a qualified or competent sysadmin can easily make k and up.

5665350,0,t3_3spbxr,Please correct me if Im misunderstanding something but it sounds like youre offering more of a USBbased rescue device than an actual antivirus solution. This would very much take away from our bottom line allowing a customer to possibly complete a virus removal from home. In addition a strictly antivirus solution will not save end users from things like annoying toolbars PCSpeedFixOptimizer Proetc... which is where a majority of our users issues arise from. USB rescue software has never touched a piece of software like this  it is always manual removal or by using a tool such as ADWCleaner or JRT while running inside the customers OS. Very rarely do we actually encounter a truetodefinition virus.    How do you handle licensing all of these various antivirus engines for sale while being able to keep the price point comparable to the solutions that users are already buying?    In your proposed support scenario your company would be providing support to our users. This does not seem like an ideal scenario as our continued relationships with regular customers is one of the most important things to our business.    Truthfully from my own perspective this just does not seem like a viable or worthwhile solution for either our customers or our business.,computertechs,cwzcbdc,3,t5_2soz7

The video card drivers NVIDIA Go  did not play nice with Windows   a couple manual edits of a INF was required as was enabling installation of unsigned drivers.Secondly after Windows Updates there is still a missing driver for the coprocessor the installation of the nForce drivers kept failing for me so I manually browsed to the property directory and it installed perfectly fine.Afterwards a screen calibration later and you should be good to go.Note Havent tested remote as my battery is dead and the DVD button doesnt do anything not that I care a whole lot.,computertechs,cx0vqy4,1,t5_2soz7

Avoid heavy thirdparty libraries wherever possible.  Dont bother with web fonts. They arent worth the page weight. Go static or cache as much as possible. For your blog or whatever consider using a static site generator such as octopress. Youll withstand the heaviest of reddit hugs be immune to web security issues and your site will be the fastest around. If you really need to use a dynamically generated website such as wordpress configure it to cache as much as possible. WP Super Cache is pretty good. Optimise your image content. This will make your pages load faster and save bandwidth.     Run your PNGs through optipng strip all o and advdef z i     Run your JPGs through jpegoptim stripall     Run your SVGs through svgo. Check the result carefully it messes up some images but can provide huge reductions in others. Set up clientside caching. Configure your servers expire headers for static content to cache it a reasonable amount of time. For repeat visitors your site will load very fast and youll save bandwidth.,computertechs,d002env,4,t5_2soz7

I work for an industrial pc integrator and we frequently have to send off devices with XP embedded windows  and we even had a request for NT. Some of this hardware and software just do not run on new stuff and rewrites or upgrades are way too expensive. Having said that definitely stop doing his job.

8503845,0,t3_4vro3j,Ezzep youve gotta consider that a lot of heavy machinery used in industrial settings are super expensive and tailored to run on a particular OS. Its not uncommon at all for a business to run machines that are   even  years old if the processes are still working fine. Companies that make industrial equipment fold up and go out of business and are no longer able to provide software interfaces for new OSs that will support their old legacy industrial machines. Yes its a pain in the ass to find parts for dated hardware but if you can still find the parts it may be . the cost of replacing the PCs and then getting all new industrial equipment that link with software thats compatible with new OSs industrial equipment can cost s and s of thousands of dollars... source I do IT work for mass production facilities all over Phoenix including cabinet makers steel fabrication wood working print design companies etc...As for your other problem if youre doing all the IT work Id tell the owner. Id say hey look I know you and the IT guy may have some family ties but I also know that most business owners want to see their money utilized in the most efficient way... we have a problem in the IT department... youre literally paying him to do nothing... hundreds of dollars a week are just being flushed down the toilet... and Im the one doing the IT work... we need to fix this ... if youre open and up front about it you may find that hell side with the best use of the dollar and figure something out. Also as other people have suggested stop doing what youre not being paid for. Youre enabling the IT guy to be lazy. Youre not his mother.,computertechs,d64j97x,1,t5_2soz7

Inform her of what exactly needs to be fixed and fix it at your cost except for hardware of course and make her happy. If you leave and she is unhappy then word of mouth will kill you. She will be guaranteed to tell multiple people about the bad experience she had with you and you will lose referrals if you can make this person happy.You dug your own grave now fill the whole back up.
