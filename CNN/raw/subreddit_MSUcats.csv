Let me give you a couple scenarios. you consume a mind altering substance and try to climb into bed fall backwards crack your skull wake up with a broken face on the floor because you rolled over in your sleep You want to make sex with someone but with a loft that tall it sways and makes noise and sex is less funproductive.Even just the hassle of getting in and out would suck. What do you want to do underneath your loft jumping jacks? Pretty sure most of the lofts I ever saw were about  feet tall underneath perfect for sitting on a couch or putting a TVchair underneath or whatever.,MSUcats,cszy8e2,1,t5_2spa2
