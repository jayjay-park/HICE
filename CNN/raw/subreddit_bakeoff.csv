Like others have mentioned the UK names for some stuff is confounding icing sugar? and the hyperspecific regional associations with some baked goods is understandably largely lost on us but after a while its easy to get the gist of even those finer details.,bakeoff,ctuzse6,6,t5_32xrn

8732138,0,t1_d6wnw70,I had the exact same reaction to Candice. I think it was the harsh lipstick that does sound so mean.  Unfortunately my gut instinct on Selasi is that hell be very accomplished in some areas but will tank when they hit bread or pastry or something that he doesnt have a lot of experience in. The blue cake would have looked amazing if the icing was absolutely flat and shiny but those swallows were dire also.  And who knew you could bake your own jaffa cakes!!?! Ive got the recipe off the website and added it to all the other recipes I fully intend on baking one day but never get around to it. Rock on biscuit week!,bakeoff,d6x5w3j,10,t5_32xrn

9178610,0,t1_d8ffgki,Theres quite a few countries in Europe and a good amount of culinary diversity. Some countries like France have a long and celebrated culinary history so obviously theres a lot of source material to study.Another thing since the s theres been a huge shift towards the study of fashion food and other household essentials. To be honest its super fascinating to me as a history nerd as it makes imagining how people lived ages ago so much easier. ,bakeoff,d8fgf7u,9,t5_32xrn

9397123,0,t1_d961zm5,OK having given it some thought I see why people love Frances. She was always prepared and she always had something extra to add to her bakes. Ruby on the other hand always winged it and kind of got by on natural talent. I think those are the exact reasons why I loved Ruby and didnt like Frances and why other people felt the opposite. ,bakeoff,d975gik,2,t5_32xrn

In the subsequent series they stayed in the same place but presumably they kept the tent because it had become a bit iconic.,bakeoff,dgr8fqr,5,t5_32xrn
