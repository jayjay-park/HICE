6910458,0,t3_49wd0b,For my own personal thing I call my body nonbinary. Male and female are words used to gender the body and I know Im not intersex so I think of my sex as nonbinary to match my gender. If it helps Ive had top surgery and a hysterectomy but no hormones.For doctors and medical stuff the gender marker on my medical records is now N in most places which I think stands for nonspecified. That may well be specific to my medical system which is UK NHS. Its probably a good idea to ask your most accessible doctor what their system allows you to use what options there are. No marker? Fill in the blank? Other? Unspecified?,NonBinary,d0zmd25,2,t5_2vcez

8217616,0,t3_4rmvdt,Ive been wanting to purchase a binder instead of just wearing tight sports bras but I have some of the same concerns. My style is definitely more fem than masc and Im not out to anyone. I try to have a somewhat androgynous style but I do still wear some of my feminine clothing. I have tried to wear more masculine clothing but didnt feel very comfortable in them it wasnt my style at all. The only thing I can think of to hide binder straps when wearing more fem clothing is to wear scarves but that doesnt even help all the time. Ive been doing this when wearing shirts that should be worn with a normal bra to hide the sports bra but it gets hot and sometimes the clothes move so you can obviously tell Im wearing a sports bra with a nice top. If you figure this out please let me know! ,NonBinary,d54ra2e,1,t5_2vcez

9127901,0,t1_d88simp,Ehhh. As a multiattracted trans nonbinary visually ambiguous person theres a world of difference between going out with a friend and being assumed to be a straight couple and versus being assumed to be queer. Its the same operative difference between being seen as an acceptably genderconforming man versus being seen as an extremely nonconforming woman. Conditional privilege is still privilege as long as the conditions are met. I think that if you have conditional privilege in a situation where others dont the ethical thing to do is let them speak before you do because while youre aware of the effects of discrimination outside those circumstances that is not a situation where youre experiencing it as directly as folks who dont meet the conditions for that conditional privilege. ,NonBinary,d890znc,1,t5_2vcez
9141607,0,t1_d8apszq,Thank you for responding to this I just needed to get it out there. It wasnt an ace bandage it was a like a scarf thing I had it to hand Im an impatient person. I felt silly at first but something felt right about trying at least. I think that something Ive noticed is that although this is the beginning of a journey questioning and being curious for me there are people who are non binary experiencing things that I seem to be too. I will see if I can talk to someone I assume I would need a referral from my GP. Ah I had actually seen that they are separate. I suppose Im trying to figure out if how my wanting to express myself is changing potentially means my gender identity is likely to as well. I at first thought that I was suffering from internalised misogyny. But I am aware that women can do all the things men can and not conform to conventions. I just sometimes really really dont feel feminine and for others to see me that way as you mentioned.I think youre right. It just feels like all this time I thought I was just an ally doing some thorough researching for a friend when really it may have been more without me realising it until now. And I wont I hear bad things!,NonBinary,d8arj22,2,t5_2vcez
9451597,0,t1_d9d4luh,gt Reasonably inferring that people means most people This gets tricky.I still feel extremely uncomfortable with generalizing like saying people to mean most people.  The reason is that this exact practice is usually used to erase me.  I encounter people doing it almost every day of my life.  So on one level this little linguistic pattern actively reminds me of trauma that I experience almost every day of my life and have experienced since I was very young.People are either male or female. or White people dont want authentic Chinese food they only like the Americanized stuff. or Teenagers are so irresponsible. or You know how college students are. or Thats just how boys are. or You know how grad students are. or Thats just how corporate America is. or Americans want... or People want... ugh.  Just about every period of my life I have been subjected to a barrage of generalizations in which my identity needs preferences strengths weaknesses desires dreams values passions were erased sometimes passively often actively and in coercive ways with people using generalizations to directly contradict things I was trying to express to others in direct simple terms.Generalizations have been used to justify me being sexually assaulted and then explaining away the sexual assault.  I.e. Men someone gendering me male always want sex. therefore me saying no I must actually just be being politeSo like because of this I feel like generalizations are a weapon that is usually used to reinforce oppressive power structures that most harm marginalized groups.  And because of this I dont want to use them and I dont really want anyone to use them.  Even if your intention is completely benign in this particular instance and even if you and everyone reading this thread knows exactly what you mean and this is doubtful given that were on the internet and anyone could be reading this thread when you make those generalizations youre still setting an example and establishing a pattern or habit of a sort of lazy communication that is highly likely to come back around and hurt us all in multiple ways.Does this make sense?TLDR this type of generalization triggers trauma in me and I suspect in others?. It also is a pattern that is frequently used to oppress and Im super cautious of using it even in benign ways because of its potential to reinforce oppressive power structures.,NonBinary,d9e21or,1,t5_2vcez

10705766,0,t3_5srqsh,If you find highwaisted pants look to feminine you could try wearing shirts or other tops not tucked in that go down lower and are a little baggy so that they cover up the top of any highwaisted pants you wear.  This could include mens section stuff if youre able to find ones that fit comfortably.  If youre  and size  you will probably have no trouble finding tops that are a bit longer in the womens section too.There are so many gender signals other than shape.  Some thoughts of things to consider include color  pattern.  Mens clothing is usually more drab with subdued earth tones with more grays and browns.  certain patterns of striping i.e. certain widths and colors also look more masculine.  look at lots of people and get ideas and then look for stuff that you can wear that will project that vibe. fabric texture.  More rugged textures slightly stiffer less elastic or formfitting usually are more masculine.  they also hang off the body in a way that will make you look more bulky but in a more angular way rather than a curvy way. consider slightly frumpy at least in certain ways.  A lot of people I know who are AFAB and trying to present femininely end up struggling because they look so dapper and it ends up somehow looking feminine because they look too nice and most men dont look that nice.  You might want that but to be honest I think one way to look more masculine is to care a little bit less about the appearance...and in casual dress there can be some guys who put care into their appearance but take care to do it in such a way that it doesnt look like they care too much...spend some time looking at men as you go through your life and youll see what I mean. body language.  I find body language often overpowers any sort of signals originating from clothing.  body language is great too because it can change how people treat you or interact with you even if theyre consciously gendering you a way that you dont want to be gendered.  It also changes how you feel which can be great.  body language can include subtle mannerisms and gestures as well as whole body poses and posture and facial expressions.  body language can also really help with height there are some people who are short and I always remember  imagine them as taller than they are because they have such a bold presence. try shoes that have a slightly thicker more rigid sole but not much of a heel.  womens shoes on average tend to be thinner soled and more flexible and this is true both of dress shoes and casual sneakers but even if youre wearing womens shoes you can find stuff structured more like a typical mens shoe.  this will change your gait in a way that will make it look more masculine i.e. youll be able to take slightly longer bolder strides.I hope you find this helpful!,NonBinary,ddk7xi4,3,t5_2vcez

10838101,0,t3_5uvvaw,This is certainly where things get messy!  Personally if I was dating another NB person I wouldnt consider it a gay relationship... but thats because Im not gay and I take the stance that for example a bi cisman and a pan transwoman dating isnt a hetero relationship just because it contains a man and a woman  neither member of the couple is hetero themselves.Im NB and pan and I tend to just go with queer.  It covers all bases for me!  But is that how your character feels?  They dont identify as any particular gender but are they attracted to all genders?
