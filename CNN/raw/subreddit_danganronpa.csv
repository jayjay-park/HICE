However we saw that Hajime did not and it was implied that the other survivors did not as well. From this we can see that there a possibility that the other survivors might wake up albeit low. .I like how they presented chapter  to us.

2464993,0,t1_cmfuvxo,Yeah I get what youre saying. The way I see it Gundhams plan of murdering guarantees that at least one person still dies no matter which of the three outcomes was chosen so by Nekomaru and Gundham agreeing to fight theyre basically signing up for one of them to be that one person not to mention the other person still has to get through a class trial. He didnt seem to force Nekomaru into the situation since like Fuyuhiko brought up Gundhams plan wouldnt have had any problems if Nekomaru showed up because he could just act like nothing happened. I think that he did that to call things off in the event that Nekomaru didnt agree to join in on his plan. Like he said Nekomaru could have just done several other things but he agreed to fight because he shared Gundhams mindsetthat they can potentially save at least one persons life but somebody has to die to do it and both of them were willing to do that. As for why he didnt bring it up until the end of the case Gundham doing that would just be giving up his life so just like he did with Nekomaru he refused to back down until he was locked into a checkmate after the PTA. Unlike the other killers sans the one with the deeper murder plan in trial  Gundham doesnt get offended when hes accused of being the killer. He doesnt say things like why are you treating ME like a killer or anything like that. When hes found out he doesnt try to justify his actions either. He doesnt back down and give up his life without a fight but still gave everyone an opportunity to save themselves. Again his plan had guaranteed success. He wasnt necessarily trying to save his own life but he just didnt want to throw away an opportunity to keep at least one person of the group alive. When the group is agreeing to have everyone die he felt the need to go against that. Even if they voted wrong one person would have lived. In the actual situation where he was found out his actions still benefited everyone more because it still beats all the people dying. He set up a murder plan instead of confessing for the same reason he fought Nekomarudoing so is resigning life so while hes creating the opportunity that the others couldnt bring themselves to do he sees the situation as no different as one animal eating another to survive. Its why he encourages everyone to crush him when he surrenders. Now that hes in a checkmate and has no more room to argue he stops fighting.Its true that the students are clearly smart enough to figure out even really elaborate cases but in this situation hes not necessarily trying to save his own life. His plan isnt to kill someone to save himselfits just to kill someone so that everybody can move forward and someone can live so even if hes caught as the killer he actually succeeds in his ultimate goal. Hes just doing his all to fight and survive because thats what drove him to kill in the first place. I would argue that his plan was pretty solid as there were three situational things that got him caught. this trial cannot be solved at all unless at least one other person cleared the final dead room  and we saw that people werent willing to go after an ultimate weapon since none of them intended to kill if they were willing to starve. Nagito only went in for the sake of the investigation not for the weapon. His murder not only killed Nekomaru and gave him an option but it also meant that half the students including Hajime and Chiaki two of the smartest students there from even having an opportunity to investigate the Final Dead Room. Obviously I know that this isnt a perfect point but being able having to go through a death chamber and having only a  chance of living at the very best still helps people from finding you out. Nagito just happening to have a compass on him. The point about the elevator spiraling around the houses couldnt really be answered unless you just happened to have that on you so Nagitos luck really just got this guy killed. Fuyuhikos interference when he tried to return to his room. Even if the other two points didnt happen Gundhams plan would have been solid had he secured his alibi and returned to his room as planned. He definitely should have accounted for the possibility of someone being outside.He wasnt necessarily trying to get away with it in itself he and Nekomaru just made the choice that nobody else wanted to make. ,danganronpa,cmgdgjh,1,t5_2wcd0
2570067,0,t1_cmtwyir,Again Im not questioning that Ikusaba isnt the mastermind. I get the point behind the situation but its still clearly contradicting points made earlier.Im just kind of perplexed why theres this huge contradiction and people just go with it. The game kind of does that at times with Kirigiri. Like in trial  when she brings up the fact that Yamada always refers to people by using their full names she completely ignores the fact that he just took a severe blow to the head and may not have kept his usual speech patterns.Its true it eventually came to the correct answer but at the time she couldnt confirm her guess for sure yet so to just piece it together based on an assumption like that is what makes it problematic to me.,danganronpa,cmu1o21,2,t5_2wcd0

3556323,0,t1_cpxfdzy,My bad. Youre totally right about Chapter  not making much sense for some reason the fact that Teruteru and Twogami would now be alive only came to me after I wrote most of the Chapter  murder. Oh and I didnt even think of others continuing my story Im sorry.  Anyway on to the conclusionThe students quickly realized that someone wanted them to suspect Mikan but several things didnt add up. Considering her smyptoms it would seem weird that she went to the Pharmacy and passed Nanami twice without harming her not to mention her tied up state. The possibility of this someone to only kill Ibuki while Akane was still killed by Mikan also didnt seem likely because the culprit would gain no benefit from it. This fact made Mikan seem a little bit more on ease though she still didnt stop crying the whole trial. After lots of arguing they decided on the following turn of events  The killer must have went to the Pharmacy for the sleeping pills then to the hospital to carry Akane into Mikans room to kill her. Afterwards they commanded Ibuki to also go into the room lock the door behind her take a lot of sleeping pills and untie Mikan if she started to get dizzy. Mikan then most likely mutilated the corpses until the disease started to wear off.  The suspicion quickly fell on Nanami because she had the hospital to herself and may have been infected with the disease during her care. But after not speaking for a long time Nanami suggests that she may have been narcotized by the same sleeping pills that killed Ibuki. Evidence is found in form of a small amount of white powder on the bottom of a half empty water bottle she still had in her backback.  They didnt have much more clues and Monokuma started to get bored but after arguing in circles for a while Hiyoko asked how the killer even managed to take Akane to Mikans room. There were no signs of a struggle in Akanes room she would also have screamed in panic if anyone besides Nanami or Nekomaru were to...  Nekomaru!From there on conclusions were reached in quick succesion. He must have been infected while carrying Mikan from the restaurant to the hospital. At this point Nekomarus despair disease personality started to appear and his insane babbling about love and despair quickly persuaded everyone of his guilt.,danganronpa,cpxn7zc,1,t5_2wcd0

Its allencompassing despair  the fear sadness hate and other assorted emotions that drive someone over the edge.. The hope that springs forth after being relentlessly pummeled by despair is most brightest!  Nagito. Basically he wanted to keep creating more despair in the event that a shining hope would rise up and eclipse it. The root of his insanity is hope you see Nagito abused hope to create despair in a vicious cycle to force more hope to spring forth and absolve them once and for all..

4686772,0,t1_ctksj7x,What it comes down to for me is that Chiaki should have spent less time pandering to what the writers thought players might want and more time fleshing out her character in interesting ways. I would agree with your assessment that no Danganronpa character is especially deep and most of them live or die by how  much they can connect with the player. It was hard to want to connect with Chiaki during day to day interactions when I felt vaguely insulted by their attempts to sell me on her with throwaway video game references If this was a video game the difficulty level would be very high isnt a sentence I can imagine ANYBODY saying. I dislike when an assumed persona is used to explain away character inconsistencies unless its very clear what is and isnt real which I dont think is the case here. Is Chiaki faking sleepiness or powering through it when things get serious? Why wouldnt she always be serious when its obvious that murders can and will happen? This is part of why I found her inconsistent.I do grant that there is a lot of effective foreshadowing about Chiakis nature although I think it serves to makes the plot twist cleaner and more believable more than it gives Chiaki depth. Its nice that there are plenty of hints to it but I hold that for the reasons above she feels like a character who is trying to simultaneously be two different things. You brought up harem anime characters early and thats what Chiaki felt like to me in her day to day interactions. She tries to win appeal in cheap and easy ways. When she stops messing around during serious moments she got more interesting but I didnt feel like it was enough to carry those less interesting stretches.,danganronpa,ctlb8xe,1,t5_2wcd0

Komaru makes contact with her brother around halfway through this period which gives Future Foundation more information.As stated in the game they would have come eventually but I think the situation along with Byakuya being captured would cause them to pause for a bit and take time to decide upon an action. ,danganronpa,cv0o532,1,t5_2wcd0

5230066,0,t1_cvgdnsm,s I find his motive consistent with his thought process like you said and some examples youve mentioned already. In line with his belief that people should never give up on life you can draw two other conclusions as well. Gundam couldnt just give himself up as that would be going against his own philosophy no matter the reason. Thus he made a feeble effort to defend his own life.s Two the others had already given up on life. Sure Gundam could kill someone and save them but what good would that do? They had already resigned themselves to their fate and were okay with dying there why would Gundam waste his efforts into saving these people? What about next time? He wanted them to fight for their lives and find a reason to keep going forward which clearly works looking at Sonia. Itd be too easy with nothing to learn if he just up and said Hey I did it saved you guys no problem. Waiting for death and waiting for salvation neither lined up with Gundams ideals so he had to let the others piece it together.s Though we can see his true intentions anyways considering his lackluster defense and basically admitting it after a slight push plus leaving extraneous evidence at the scene.,danganronpa,cvgex2g,1,t5_2wcd0

5286742,0,t3_3nekcy,As a disclaimer I cant recall if this is how they explained it but this is how I assumed it worked.The virtual reality of the Neo World Program was beyond any comprehension as far as we know. The students had no way of knowing it was not reality. Essentially because they cant differentiate reality from virtual reality when they die in the virtual reality their brain believes they died in reality. Sonia makes a remark about this somewhere but whether it actually applies to NWP Im not sureEven if they could recover and upload the avatars what do you think will happen if you upload memories of being killed? Im pretty sure that might not end the way we want it to. The avatars were created from removing memories from the original bodies. I dont think Makoto and co. made backups of the memories in case they need to run it twice before uploading the avatars into the NWP. Remember the NWP didnt even have the concept of killing it was only because of the Junko virus that it was possible. As a result I think its pretty likely they didnt think they needed backups because the only situation where they would dying doesnt actually exist. ,danganronpa,cvnfz4x,2,t5_2wcd0

5999844,0,t3_3xmzeg,I actually think having a few characters that are less likable makes the cast stronger for DR. Not everyone you meet will be someone you want to hang out with so it makes the cast feel more real. And while they arent all likable as umahirunayo said they arent bad people.It actually makes Hajime seem like a more robust person than Naegi he can make this entire rainbow of personalities become his best pals and gets everyones cooperation with cases while Naegi has trouble coaxing a bunch of reasonable people into helping him so they dont all die while they actively push toward voting for the wrong person.Then theres the story dissonance. DR spoilers s In DR all the students are people who hung out for a year together and were all close friends before being brainwashed and Junko probably selected them for the game partially because they were the type of people nobody would consider murderers. The despair of knowing anyone could be forced to kill another was probably one of the main objectives.DR spoilers s Meanwhile DR is occupied by Ultimate Despair a bunch of mass murdering psychopaths who were brainwashed to before they went crazy so of course some of their people are going to be assholes. Even in Island mode with Usami telling them to live peacefully they ask several times whether they should start killing each other and it didnt take much pushing for the murders to start.,danganronpa,cy63z6o,3,t5_2wcd0

6206603,0,t1_cyulank,Ok I got a bit distracted but I finished the story.The format is awesome. It even feels a bit like the first game including the React feature.About the story itself looks good although there a few part where it seems like things happen too fast. Like this one it breaks the pacing. A few new lines of just huhs and ...s like in the game could be useful.Also I liked how you ignored the whole rules and explanation part and went quickly into actions and coexistence. Every other fanfiction out there writes it again so it was a nice touch. But it would be wise to add a line saying they passed through it anyways.The free times fulfilled their purpose. Now I genuinely want to know more about Cynthia Robert Yvonne and Sasha. The format helped a lot too.And talking about the format again... I got curious and checked the source code. Squiffy seems like a very interesting tool but the way it handles the nodes of the story is a bit weird. Im not going to go over technical things but I got how you plan on making the trial variability you talked about in the introduction. This format really has a lot of potential.I know it requires more work but you should add some conditionals inside the phases. For example if you did Bastians free time he should have called you Kyle instead of Mr. Grey when you asked him whats he doing after the meeting. Or make Willow be less harsh when you ask her if you chose the correct path in her free time.Anyway you brought a great way to tell this story to this subreddit. I say go on.Oh and about the murder be careful on how you develop it. So far looks dangerously similar to the original.,danganronpa,cyv4hot,1,t5_2wcd0

6245426,0,t3_413xm1,Im not sure if Ultimate Gamer HAD to be bad but the way it ended up being used was uninspiring to say the least. I think theres a LOT more that could have been done with it. Just off the top of my head what about a character whos obsessed with metagaming and speed running and applies those concepts in real life? Like he swims across the pool in the morning instead of walking around it to get to breakfast faster.

6282588,0,t3_41nnj8,Okay first off props for making an obvious baitandswitch work so well. You go up to Hiyoko small girl in a kimonoyukata expect her to be all petite and it turns out shes killing bugs because she likes the way they feel and sound as they die. Of all the fucked up things Id seen in my time that was the fuckest upest. Or something.Beyond that she goes on to attract a lot of cheap heat calling everyone names bullying Twogami and especially Mikan. So uh I didnt like her. But that was the intention. She attracted heat but not XPac heat in the same way as say Nagito. Or Mahiru.Mahiru and Hiyoko are entirely intertwined and not to give away all of my material on Mahiru now but Hiyoko latching on to her so seemed kinda selfserving. Hiyoko needs some anchor for empathy so she doesnt come off as a completely unlikeable asswipe you want to see killed off so who better to give that role to than the person who does nothing else in the story? Not only did it seem way transparent it also didnt strike me as the relationship having a lot of chemistry.Hiyoko is...well shes a troll and while Mahirus sisters doing it for themselves mentality might find something to latch onto in Hiyokos carefree attitude I would have thought her own nononsense outlook that doesnt put up with a lick of bullshit would have clearly defenestrated any friendship the two could have had. While its just believeable enough I think it would have been better if Hiyoko had had a connection with say Akane.But then she couldnt have mourned over someone at the beginning of Chapter  I guess. I liked that it gave her a sympathetic role for a short window of time and that it took her a damn long while to even think of forgiving Fuyuhiko. Its subtle but the two play off each other incredibly well during their visit to the hospital. Hiyoko is a firespitter Fuyuhikos recently been put in his place and while sorrowful and apologetic is not in a mood to argue.And then she dies.This death I did not like at all because it seemed like a very obvious portrayal of the writing process. Shed gone through her character arc served her purpose had her moment of redemption and now that the story was starting to get really serious with its overarching mystery she had to be written out of it. Its literally through coincidence of timing that she is found and killed at all and...it literally makes no sense that her body was discovered. What reason would Mikan have for uncovering the wallpaper hiding her body when she leaves the bar?I struggle to think of a way she could have been meaningfully integrated into the story past that point when her connection with Mahiru hit its peak in the aftermath of Chapter  which was the backbone of her character but as I said I didnt think its foundation was that strong to begin with. Certainly she deserved a better death than the old leave no witnesses treatment.Not much else to her than that though a picture of her older self being a clue to the big reveal was great. Because it really emphasizes how her youthful appearance is what sets her apart from the rest of the cast so when a picture of her is noticeably older you really feel the dissonance.,danganronpa,cz3rcwt,5,t5_2wcd0

6434391,0,t3_43t9ht,Nagito is one of my favorite characters. I really like how brillant manipulative and twisted he is. People usually dislike him because he end causing the death of nanami but why dont you view his characterization? He is one of the most immersive characters in the series also as people thinks nagito is one of the villains i might think he is a antihero. First he decided to do something after knowing that the students in the jabberwock island are the remnants of despair. It was his selfish way to do the things but his motives are clearly understandable giving the situation he was in. Also just like i end understanding Mikan and now she is one of my favorite characters how about we understand Nagito? He clearly have a story of good and bad luck. Not to mention he didnt had a good relationship with his parents and neither friends. So all those stuff that happeend with him end making he think he was useless and worthless. Not to mention he is sick and have health problems. He is a good character.

Maybe I should make a guide on it or something since a lot of people seem to hate it but I never had problems with it the first time I played and I only like the system even more now.Didnt care for logic dive. Its just multiple choice questions which the game already had but it gets stretched out in a pointless racing mini game.Panic talk action is fine with me.I love rebuttal showdown. You can go back and play DR  and tell why they made it because it helps to make the trial feel more alive and reflect when individual people are pushing back against the trials.

Additionally concerning their uniforms they lack the jackets seen in the anime so we can assume the Sato event took place during the summerspring as Japanese schools make blazers and jackets mandatory for the colder seasons which is likely when the anime will take place again considering the designs. Hiyoko also has her early hairstyle which we know she had when she first entered Hopes Peak so if shes moved to a single ponytail in DR thats likely a year later result so we can possibly take a guess that the Sato event happened a year later or so after their admittance. Theres also Mikan with the extra bandage in DR but I wont look at it then again this is anime so eh.I mean if Im actually correct wed likely get the Sato event in flashbacks but I really hope Im wrong and we see it happen.,danganronpa,d33tg5w,3,t5_2wcd0

7618375,0,t3_4jl8l4,We dont really know all we do know is that Hajime kept his memories.During the last trial in a moment many seem to forget Hajime merged his mind with Izuru allowing him to keep his memories in true anime fashion and turning him super saiyan for the remainder of the trial. It may be that the entire reason he kept his memories is because of that allowing his avatar into his body before the program was shut down and that the rest of the crew lost their memories and just respects Izuru enough to follow his lead.However theres also the issue of the program being untested so even the assumptions about the options we were presented might not be accurate. They mention how Usami showed up despite presumably being dead and Chiaki stuck around for a most of the final trial so its entirely possible that the profiles of the dead students are still there. The graduates of the first game seem to think the Ultimate despair survivors have escaped with their memories so for now well have to assume they did. However since even Makoto and friends dont know theres not much certainty apart from Hajime keeping his identity...,danganronpa,d3864b7,2,t5_2wcd0

7856858,0,t3_4mtorc,That Killer Killer image really got me thinking about Twogami. I dont think we can definitively say that postUD Imposter looked like that. While I wouldnt be terribly surprised if that ends up being the case it does seem rather odd that he would reuse the same identity again. Hiyoko is also small so could they simply have  used the familiar look of those characters as the readers would know them? While we could figure out it was him simply by the process of elimination we would never actually recognize a silhouette of any of his identities beyond Ryota and Byakuya.Having said that the implication was that starting with the first recap page where the empty space outside of the main panel is black instead of the usual white we were actually reading the mangakas inuniverse manga version of The Tragedy. In which case he could only know them by their appearances after becoming Ultimate Despair.But this still contradicts Hiyokos appearance. From what we learn in DR she had her growth spurt during her time at the academy before becoming UD correct? her smiling grown up photograph seems to support this. The mangaka couldnt have known this and even if he did why would he depict her preUD appearance in a picture of UD?So while the Imposters look can be explained by him simply reusing one of his previouslyused identities for whatever reason Hiyokos cannot. Which brings me back to the conclusion that explicitly using their DR appearances was simply a concession for the reader rather than any kind of canonical statement about their appearances during their time as Ultimate Despair.Again not saying that he couldnt have used that identity just that we still dont really know anything for sure. I hope this didnt come off as too nit picky. I just had this thought after reading and ran with it.,danganronpa,d3z6k5k,1,t5_2wcd0

His relationship with Asahina is different then his one with Togami for example. Im mostly speaking hypothetically but based on said personalities people could interpret some bonds stronger than others when in fact they are all strong relative to each characters respective personality. But I will admit that many dont think so deeply into this as we are and that the phenomenon of shipping really doesnt rely much cannon justifications so perhaps its futile to try to figure this out. LolI do hope for the same in  however. My fear is that they will end up killing off who ever he is interested in lol.  years? Thats great! I hope you can get it published one day. Beginnings are hard for me because unlike the rest that for the most part flows naturally you have to think about the beginnings appeal as a hook while still having it fit logically in the narrative. And its not just you its not the easiest to find a plot that fits the world you created or build a world that compliments your plot. Im sure your characters are really interesting. Yeah I can tell youre good at analyzing. Lol. Its a good trait. To be honest Ive been taking the casual player side in these discussions. Im not as well read as you on the interactions and such but hey in my defense initial interpretations are important too since it speaks for the majority of players. jk I highly respect your in depth perspectiveI could never do mysteries either. Having to make a good mystery and build the audiences suspense is something I couldnt do. Im open to anything though so if there is a way I can help you just ask. But you seem pretty competent.

8394688,0,t1_d5quxtx,Interesting. Koichi definitely seems pretty mysterious. Outside of Kimura who seemed to be looking for others he was the only person traveling by himself. And his laidback attitude while he is trapped in a game where people are dying left and right is offputting. Plus his insight into the others characters could explain why the NG codes seem so appropriate for each character such as Naegi being unable to run when he is constantly being pursued and Asahina unable to defend him. Hmm....Thanks for sharing this. I had not really heard much about him but thinking about it now he does seem one of the more suspicious people.

I doubt its going to happen but it makes the most sense. At the very least its a red herring.Whats interesting about this type of reaction is that in the game I dont think people would be as mad. Wed see her get up again in a minute so it would be a quick fake out.

8417934,0,t3_4upgwy,Your theory is interesting but some details dont match up. First it is shown that it is sakakura who takes a look at chisas body. But it is also shown that they are friends from a long time they were friends when they were students at the kibougamine academy. He would have definitely immediately seen that it wasnt her if your theory was true even if the dead body was very similar to chisa. Then you have to consider that in your theory the sleeping miaya would still be in the chair and if I think that it is possible for the chair to  hung people I dont think that she could let miaya fall on the ground and then put her back in the same position when the work is done. Both crimes implied a certain amount of blood miaya would have definitely gotten some on her.Finally I dont see how the chair could bring tomato sauce put it on an exact part of asahinas body then bring a knife and put it right between her boobs. Think about it it may not look like this but it a very complicated operation that requires hands or at least something very similar to it. Its impossible to afford with only ladders from the wheelchair cause miaya would have already used mechanical arms if she had some.,danganronpa,d5ts9p4,1,t5_2wcd0

8435120,0,t1_d5vsrks,Im sure people will argue with me but the first anime really is pretty much a waste of time.  It was my introduction to the series but I stopped it a few episodes in because I could tell it was suffering from visual novel anime syndrome. Actually I guess its not a waste of time so much because like many of these VN adaptations its kind of fun to watch after you already know the characters.  But to introduce yourself to the charactersscenario  well I think it would come off hokey and the characters flat.I was going to use Umineko for my example instead of Higurashi but whereas Id call the Higurashi anime more like flawed and incomplete I thought Umineko was one of the worst anime Ive watched. Perhaps it didnt help that I watched it right after enduring Pupa which I think is literally one of the mosthated anime of all time and with good reason.  If anyone reading this looks it up and thinks the premise sounds cool let me tell you  the premise IS cool and you dont want to see the way they squander it.  Maria is a perfect example of a character I couldnt stand in anime but felt quite sympathetic toward in the VN.  In the anime I almost rooted for her to be hurt that sounds awful I realize and its not like me at all because I didnt see her as a kid or even a person at all.  In the VN she seemed very much like a child to me and really switched my protective instincts on.,danganronpa,d5vxgqs,1,t5_2wcd0

Also Munakata has been presented as a really shitty judge of character what with him trying to kill Naegi so him failling to notice that Chisa who was a genuinely nice person became evil would actually make sense. Also this is basically the biggest meeting of the hope fondation this means the despairs are basically sending their full ressources for this.

Ruruka was claiming that she made the effect in the sweets without crediting Seiko at all. Yes Seiko likes being praised. Ruruka basically trained her into enjoying the praise of friendship so that she could get more drugs.The only way I can see it working is Seiko gave Ruruka the drug because she wanted to be her friend.

The ending to DR shows Hajime appearing as Hajime with Hajimes name in the text box and with his voice announcing that he is living as Hajime. Its super obvious that the implication was that Hajime was back regardless of any fact.To use another example MGS ends on a hopeful note. Raiden meets Rose in person Snake gives a big spiel on freedom the implication was that he was free from the patriots and can now live a normal life this was the end of his story. In MGS we learn that this was not the case he was separated from Rose and turned into a cyborg killer. There was nothing in MGS that prevents this from happening but it doesnt follow the theme and tone of MGSs ending which was a hopeful happy and concluding one. Thats what I mean.

8664287,0,t1_d6on3d4,We dont know if he will join her now.And I think this is really unlikely.He will probably join her after the first mutual killing game if you know what I mean but not now.Besides if Junko and Izuru have the same ability to analyze it would mean that like Izuru in DR chapter  Junko can predict chaos she can probably she regularities among irregularities to quote Izuru.So since shes kneedeep into despair she probably knows that despair can be predicted so she probably tells all that bull just to tempt Izuru.Also Junko probably think despair is boring too thats why she changes her personality so much.,danganronpa,d6onk7p,1,t5_2wcd0

8669098,0,t1_d6p8f84,. sure Mukuro isnt in heaven considering her already having the highest body count in the DR animation for only being around pretty much one and a half episodes Then Sakura is questionable just as theres a few religions that consider suicide to be one of the greatest sins and while she did it for noble reasons it wasnt like she dove in front of a speeding car to save a kid. Her suicide just had a chance of getting the outcome she wanted and it happened to work out just barely. So it all depends on what the true religion in the DR universe is which I doubt even Kodaka would tread into that territory with how volatile discussing religion has gotten nowadays... And I didnt know that about the manga thanks for sharing! However unless Ive missed something over the years here the games are the canon material for   and AE so things like the anime and manga are more supplementary. For Leon even the game even said that he had left Sayaka defenseless in the bathroom and could have walked away but he went to his room grabbed the tool kit grabbed the knife knocked out of Sayakas hands and broke open the door solely to kill her.Really from what Ive read and heard about the manga I think more than anything its meant to give more backstory and moments to favorite characters that didnt survive just like how Celeste got her character expanded on. Doing something like that also would allow them to paint different characters in better lights then such as Leon not looking so coldhearted.,danganronpa,d6p9a59,1,t5_2wcd0

8713331,0,t3_4zbn9o,So four things I gathered from this from least importance to most importance It says a lot about Hagakure when Naegi has something to say to both Asahina and Kyoko but nothing to him. Although perhaps this is because Naegi assumes Hagakure is safe on the outside.  Kizakura is the best. Jin is yelling at him to do his job and the best he can reply is I know... And then when Chisa is saying that they should work together his response is to leave it completely to her. Juzos in the Despair Arc is definitely hinting at some feelings for Chisa. The fact is she straight up says I wont let you have him and the best he can respond with is an awkward Yknow... as though he wants to say something but decides to stop himself. Something seems really odd with Bandai. Outside of Tengan and possibly Miaya he is the oldest person there and yet he has no connections to anyone? Freaking Hagakure has a onesided connection to Naegi. Hell we even know more about the real Miaya than we do about him such as the fact that she helped create the Neo World Program and weve never even met her in person. Then you consider the fact that Bandai has a unique character design and then showed up in Munakatas flashback in episode  even though he has been dead in Future and hasnt made an appearance in Despair. Its way too suspicious. Im thinking he is definitely in the Mukuro role where he knew a lot more than he let on was in fact one of the people responsible for engineering the game but got taken out early by the mastermind which is probably why he had such an ludicrously unfair NG code. ,danganronpa,d6usxop,6,t5_2wcd0

8772184,0,t3_5075p7,I cant really feel bad for her after all that she did. Its not like she became a horrible person due to the killing game she repeatedly complained about Seiko not eating her sweets despite being told over and over that Seiko would die if she ate them she used Seikos willingness to please her and didnt care if it upset Seiko she tried to make the judges judge her food better by using an energyboosting drug and got Seiko and Izayoi expelled with her. I personally think if Ruruka had confessed to convincing Seiko to give her the drug Seiko could have gotten away with suspension like Komaeda did that bullshit lucky student... And then in the killing game she threatens to kill Seiko unless she kills Munakata then later kills Izayoi because hes going to inadvertently kill her like you couldnt have just talked it out? If Izayoi really cared about you he would agree not to open the door... Maybe its just because I hate her but I think its more unfair for Ruruka to prevent the others from leaving just because shell die.

8793252,0,t3_50kmok,So this is supposedly a confirmed silhouette of the cast for the next Danganronpa game which has nothing to do with DR and DR SO GET OUT WIT YOUR THEORIES ON WHO THE FUCK THEY WILL BE CONNECTED TO THE OTHER MAIN CAST!So first off lets go through each character.Yellow Girl with long hair and has a short skirt. Being at the end may be something significant so lets keep her in our thoughts because nothing else can be seen with her.Orange Wearing a long dress has short hair and is seen holding hands with Red. Possible lesbian couple or just friends like Mahiru and Sayonji? Who knows?Red Her hairstyle is a bow and she has high knee socks. Is holding hands with Orange so this goes back up to the top theory.Reddish Pink Short bending over and WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT HAIRSTYLE. Edit Oh... shes a witch... CUTE x  OH MY GOD!Pink Very mysterious figure wearing some sort of cloak. About same height as witchy girl.Purple What I notice is that the feet are pointed inward. Does this signify that she is clumsy since she cant even stand up straight?Dark Blue Is standing with a confident post long hair and has a short skirt as well. Not a lot to go off.Girl  We have COLOR! She has a bow and some red eyes and pigtails and she is so red oh my god. Is that a school uniform? We shall see...And onto the guys!Light Blue Oh look its another big dude! Does this mean we will get some sort of same formula to the last game? Personally I would hope we dont but that doesnt matter for now.Pale Blue Another dude with a bowl haircut shorter than the last guy and has no other distinguishable features.Pale Green Taller than the Pale Blue guy but not taller than Light Blue guy. Has a large collar? Something is covering his face... GUNDHAM?! Guy  And more COLOR! Now we have a purple dude. Geez what is it with the developers and setting a certain color on these guys? Purple eyes and hair plus a magenta jacket. Looks super badass.Robot  Wow he is short. I did not expect him to be that short. he has a HUGE monobrow and also a high techy collar. Big white Komaeda hair and a cool jacket. Will he be just as crazy?Green Another guy with no features other than an undershirt and a slight ahoge. HOPE CONFIRMED GUIS?Yellow Green Small Chihiro looking dude standing like the last dude. Maybe siblings or just a copier?Now lets notice the colors. ALL of the people are shaded a certain color besides the confirmed but why? What is the purpose?Well I propose that the people will have a certain emotion tied to them. These all look like one dimensional characters for now but maybe their personalities will show a different light. Take the red girl for example holding the orange girls hand. She could have an attribute to that color red such as anger or maybe an advantage with the color red association like is not as prone to anger just maybe. or it is to fit the coolness of the Psycho Cool fashion. Im just curious and this is making me really hype EDIT OH MY FUCKING GOD THERE IS A TINY COLORLESS MIDGET IN THE GAME NEXT TO Guy . I DID NOT SEE HIM THANKS uBarePS,danganronpa,d74tvug,2,t5_2wcd0

8826766,0,t3_512mj9,Gundham placed Nekumaru in a situation where he intended to get him killed. It happened on a different way the gundham expected but he still set it up with the intent to kill him. Anyone can say anything in danganronpa so gundham saying that nekomaru should have been able to save himself is cheap talk. In the end Gundham was the killer because he put Nekomaru into the situation where he panicked and died.Remember how monokuma said that Nagito used what happened in the previous trials to orchestrate his. he messed with the apparent time of death as discovered in Mikans crime the no way out from Pekos and the reverse situation of gundhams crime but see the same logic. He created a situation where he would get killed just like Nekomaru was in a situation where he would die. The trick in both comes from the situation where they would both die. Therefore whoever strikes the final blow is the killer. Similar trial four in danganronpa one where everyone confessed to killing Sakura. ,danganronpa,d78ushb,1,t5_2wcd0

Its completely irrelevant. No obviously every female death is not a fridge. None of the female deaths in DR were you could argue Sayaka but her antagonistic role to the main character kind of defeats the purpose and none of this DR deaths were at least that I can think of.We literally know that Makoto is the key to all of this. The person behind all of this needs him and the women in his life are just pieces in a game. Thats the only reason Kyoko was given the NG code she was to create despair for Makoto. If thats not a fridge what the hell is?Fridging A female side character is helplessly killed by the villain to trigger something in the male character most related to the victim.

8892678,0,t3_520wqm,I think the thing is more that Dangan Island is Dangan Island and I dont know how much of the FTEs count as canon. Not any revelations about the characters those are true but just whether or not any given conversation even happened. So really were left with a character whos defining traits are mild sexism and being stern. And she dies too early to really grow out of either even though supplemental material says she can. So while theres clearly more to her than that I mean holy shit you basically wrote a ten page essay on the subject I dont blame people for not having the best lasting impression of her. Though I dont think its as common as you imply.I do think its interesting DR basically wrote out both of said negative traits though. Of course its entirely possible getting to know her classmates particularly the male ones made her grow out of them.

8955573,1,t3_52wezt,Not gonna lie this episode wasnt all that great. I was already worried how they would handle despairifying the whole class in just one or two episodes and it went about as well as I expected. I couldnt even bear watching the whole scene.Theres also the fact that nothing in this episode really surprised me. Well maybe the exact way Chiaki died wasnt exactly what I was prepared for but everything else was so predictable and boring that Im starting to wonder what Junko sees in despair because I dont get it.At least the ED is as awesome as always.

8970560,0,t3_52wezt,Ok I know theres one more episode of despair to go plus a special apparently but I think its gone on long enough for me to say this.I fucking love this show I love it. Dont get me wrong I think its very well done and this in no way makes me love it any less but I have a criticism. In all honesty now knowing that the students were turned to despair via hypnosis I cant say Im not a little disappointed with that turn out. Junko has always been hyped up as this master manipulator so when it was announced that we were all going to find out how all the students from class  fell in to despair I was so excited. What I was hoping for is that Junko was going to manipulate each one of them on a more personal level. Corrupting them one by one manipulating traits in their personalities and using events that occurred Twilight Murder to her advantage further pushing them to despair. Now I realize its not like we didnt get to see that side of her. We got to see her manipulating Izuru Ryota and Mikan. Some scenes I really liked I might add but I felt there could have been more. The fact that they were all just hypnotized which turned them from mostly good hearted people too psychotic serial killers. It just feels like it was too easy.Now to be fair to the creators. I know theres  characters in that class and  episodes so it might have been a time issue. Not to mention we got a whole game about class  so I can understand the idea that they might have wanted to put more focus on other characters that havent been explored such as the new characters Junko Mukuro The Imposter and Ryota. Still I guess I wish they would have had her manipulate at least a few more characters from class .Again this is just me nitpicking. This series has been great and waaay better then the watered down anime based off the first game in my opinion. This is one Ill probably end up returning too sometime to rewatch overall Im really happy with how it turned out. Im just curious if theres anyone who felt the same.,danganronpa,d7q4iov,1,t5_2wcd0

Shes certainly more energetic than I had pictured her but shes still true to what I thought she was in DR and DRIF. Shes not a lover of despair like Junko. She just has a very unhealthy need to make her sister happy.Admittedly it got a bit more...sexual than I imagined it with that scene on the rooftop. But thats fine since I can explain it in my head as not as incestuous as it appeared. Maybe its like Chisa except instead of despair giving a pleasurable response doing what Junko wants does.

9084687,1,t1_d83tb6b,I agree they both have their own strengths.  Kodaka is generally better at writing likable characters while Uchikoshi is better at writing complex stories and themes.  Im simply saying that Kodaka seems to be trying to shoehorn the idea of a death game into the anime rather than playing to his strengths and making it a long characterfocused saga of the clashing ideals of FF founders.Though for what its worth I do actually think Kodaka is less talented than Uchikoshi in general  or at least more willing to compromise his vision for waifus.  Even his characters are generally pandering to his fans while Uchikoshis characters are  while not immediately likable  much more subdued and grounded.  This manifests in Danganronpa depending much more on tropes and having a more anime plot with good writing while the Zero Escape series is considerably more complex and nuanced.EDIT Im going to remove the Uchikoshi comment from the original post since its not necessarily relevant to the idea that Future Arc would be better without the murder game.,danganronpa,d83txz0,0,t5_2wcd0

I imagine theyre pretty loose on those rules too. Hiyoko is the ultimate traditional dancer so she could argue that the kimono is a requirement to use her talent. Also its still a school so delinquent students not obeying the dress code out of spite is probably a thing and considering class is optional I dont think they really enforce any dress rules its just there for the goody twoshoes students like Chiaki and Nagito.,danganronpa,d853xb8,7,t5_2wcd0

9099337,0,t3_54tv2f, Naegi I like Naegi a lot more now.

But I like how they kept him consistent in the anime and didnt try to back down from some of the unpleasant parts of his character because he is popular. So the DR anime helped me appreciate him again.  Izuru I liked him to start with but I LOVE that they made him not some ambivalent pawn of Junko and a force all his own in what happened. It makes him far more interesting in my opinion.  Imposter Honestly that was the SDR character I felt the most need to get some more info on and I love him even more now.  Junko Used to be a Junko fan and I still like her but the anime did make me not like her as much. She didnt seem as impressive of a villain to me,danganronpa,d85ld8m,5,t5_2wcd0

The dilemma would have been simply a moral one.gtLike I said we know the specific way it works and we knows exactly what it does. What I said still holds true the NWP erases and then rewrites memories. gthuh... what? Literal brainwashing being in DR and being mentioned in SDR have nothing to do with each other? Even though they were created roughly at the same time? Thats newJust because brainwashing was mentioned twice in the same series doesnt mean theyre referring to the same thing. Specially in context when no one but Junko the Remnants and Chisa should know about the brainwashing.gtAnd just because the majority believes in something theyre jutified? No they misinterpreted and created their own personal headcanons about the situation thats itThe main problem with this line of reasoning is thisThese things werent baseless and certainly not headcanon. The game directly references to them. If Junko was lying then why didnt anyone call her on this?. Plus why would she even lie? The truth would have been just as despairful if not more.

Now whether hed actually be successful in doing so is well... Thats another thing entirely.

I mean in the previous installments we have had  people Sayaka the Imposter Yuta and Yukizome promoted heavily in promotional materials be introduced and then be the first person killed off in the story. At a certain point Kodaka has got to break the trend right? Its gotten to the point where all of us are saying Okay which character that seems important is going to be the first victim? I think Kodaka has realized this and is going to change up the formula. I think that if anything the person that seems important Amami Saihara Kiibo in the beginning is going to turn out to be the first culprit and that the victim is going to be someone more random Angie Gonta. This will serve the purpose of having the new fans surprised that someone they trusted planned a murder and was killed off so early as we were when Sayaka was killed first after planning to betray Naegi while at the same time keeping older fans in the dark as to what will happen.,danganronpa,d9ofqiq,5,t5_2wcd0

9548354,0,t1_d9q0nl9,oh right. I guess that makes sense.But series dont need MCs. Well except for maybe the character you play as. But even then that doesnt really need to be either.Danganronpa relies on this big cast it is a major part in its popularity. This is not just a regular series which has the main cast of like  then has a bunch of side characters.I dont think DR should be like any of those other series. I guess saying this series should have no MCs is a bit dishonest what I really mean is that this series should have No entire story MCs. More it should have chapter based MCs. People are relevant when they need to be relevant. Not just shoe horned in for basically no reason.Look at DR. Depending on the chapter different characters have different roles in the group. Sometimes Ibuki is important or sometimes Chiaki is important. Chiaki is the best example of this she doesnt really do anything when she isnt needed for the story. She was useful in Chapter  because of the motive. She was useful in chapter  because of the way the murder was layed out and she was useful in chapter  for her being the traitor and all.While on the other hand Nagito is shoved into this situations he doesnt really need to be a part of.,danganronpa,d9q15hm,2,t5_2wcd0

Your opinion of Kyoko may change since she appears in DR. You could to it where people answer and you average each value but then you run into issues of people picking only certain characters even if theyve played a game featuring that character and the averages are based on different pools of people.Id take the sacrifice of cutting out unknown characters over people who havent played the games over trying to base averages off of different numbers of people.,danganronpa,da75gbd,8,t5_2wcd0

Hes funny cynical energetic  and human . I love how much I can identify to him being a cynical high schooler who doesnt have any particular talent . And also he rickrolls the audience during Chapter  . Also I cant forget how great of a character he is when he beats Junko  with his hair turning white  fighting against his Izuru side  with the help of best girl nanami and how hard of a breakdown he had during the final trial . All of that to say  happy birthday  Hajime  youll always be one of my fav protagonist of all time .,danganronpa,dbvuqen,1,t5_2wcd0

Now I obviously prefer Sonia over Makoto Makoto in the first game was nothing more then someone who was riding Kyoko back which didnt help shape his character much and even I can admit DR existing helps shape Makotos character for me while Sonia? Shes just plain fun! Out of all the group she was level headed she knew a lot about the occult stuff some of the group didnt know about and it pretty useful during the trials. Sonia is easily in my top  and thats saying a lot with my character taste.     Sonia Nevermind gt Makoto Naegi forever!     ,danganronpa,dbyw71o,1,t5_2wcd0

10544604,0,t1_dd3af0i,Thats a difficult question because even though I follow and personally know Japanese Danganronpa fans and I had a feeling that Ouma is pretty popular for example its difficult to give an objective opinion......so what I tried was doing a quick search for each characters name in Pixiv and I think the results give a quite accurate insight on that based on my experience as well. Heres a list based on number of fanarts as of today     . Kokichi Oma     . Kaede Akamatsu     . Shuichi Saihara     . Rantaro Amami     . Maki Harukawa     . Himiko Yumeno     . Kiibo     .

Tsumugi ShiroganeCosplays are generally more complicated to make so there arent that many right now and theres also the fact that even if a character is popular the difficulty of replicating the costume in the case of Kiibo or in matching the  appearance of characters like Gonta might make people whos a fan of the character not cosplaying himher anyway but searching in one of the most popular cosplay sites Cosplayers Archive gives these results in this case the number is number of different cosplayers     Kokichi Oma     Korekiyo Shinguji     Kaede Akamatsu     Shuichi Saihara     Miu Iruma     Maki Harukawa     Angie Yonaga     Monofunny gijinka,danganronpa,dd3cjz3,9,t5_2wcd0

10742009,0,t1_ddndup4,gtMiu had herself set as an object in the simulation which should have rendered her unbreakable. Why isnt it explained how she died despite being practically invincible?I dont know if you assumed this yourself or if you read someones mistranslation but the objectperson thing is a classification in name only. There is nothing actually different about an avatar labeled object other than it can go where people arent allowed. This is explained in the game.Invincibility refers to the fact that nothing in the game world is breakable but that doesnt mean that the users are immortal. She died because the program causes any person who receives a fatal injury ingame to die in real life. also explained in the gamegtAll of the students have their previous highschools listed in their profiles except for Miu why is that? It cant be something they just forgot to put in.The first thing that came to my mind was that it meant she skips class but yeah thats a little odd. Her profile does have a school emblem though.gtCould she have faked her death being part robot seeing as she has no physical injuries and she died of shock? No one whos killed in the simulation has physical injuries. Thats just how the simulation works. Its not evidence that Mius a robot.,danganronpa,ddnygmw,7,t5_2wcd0

Even in her free time events she showed little redeeming qualities.  DRSPOILERS and her death wasnt even satisfying because her murder wasnt personal it was caused by imo the dumbest motive in either of the first two games. I didnt get any satisfaction from it because of that nor did anyone who liked her get satisfaction cause her and Ibuki were barely even mourned.

After finishing the first chapter and getting used to the characters my favs from the cast were Gundham Peko and Hiyoko.  Chiaki grew on me throughout chapters  and .

With that said though there is definitely more voiceacting in this game overall. And unless youre going to mess with the bonus contentoptional stuff the game really isnt that fanservicey per say.

They finally made a game where it wasnt just  characters dominating the trial and the rest being there as fodder with the occasional helpful comment.
