3855591,0,t3_33n9uo,Im back. I saw a few people respondedYes techinically I am a sellout but im not upfront and personal about being a sellout.Some may think that this will ruin or kill vine it wont. These types of accounts are all over every social media platform. You dont see it as much on Instagram do you? The themed accounts are generally ad free dont get ads confused with promotions....at least in the theme community theres a strong difference. WRONGGGG instagram is the biggest market for these types of ads and the ads are practically everywhere youre just not quick enough to catch it on instagram because the owners take it down within merely seconds or minutes. Regarding the person that refers to people making a living or at least some money from their talents and skills ive done it and ive seen other theme owners do it on their personals and the posts do quite well. That being said wed rather not do that and instead just do what we do now. Most of the theme accounts are declining doing rr with impersonation pages. Rather we just turn to singing accounts or dancing accounts or viral video type of accounts. This in turn will piss off people A TINY bit less.,TalkVine,cqvru7m,2,t5_37y9v
