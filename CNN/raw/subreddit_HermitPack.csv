9409323,0,t3_59ggfg,There is a possibility that it is the config file for Actually Additions on the public server that I am playing on.  Bit of a pain and the owner just said that they have not changed the configs.  They did the same regarding us not getting broken spawners on our server again something that can be truefalse in the configs.If someone has the problem there is a section in the actuallyadditions.cfg file about mob spawning and this is the bit about batsmob drops  If Wings should sometimes drop from BatsBBat Wing DroptrueI had another session killing bats and got a few stacks of leather a lot of Reliquary bats wings and no Actually Additions bat wings.  I was using a looting III sword.,HermitPack,d98p4j9,1,t5_3gttb

9434429,0,t1_d9bou2r,Mine ONLY works when I drag.  Even if I want to chunk load one chunk Ive got to drag the mouse in the box to get it selected properly.  Weird....,HermitPack,d9bvo9b,1,t5_3gttb
9525469,0,t1_d9n6604,I use the x and it works fine for me.  The x eats up all of my RAM but make sure you are doing the x on both sets the patch and the standard.,HermitPack,d9n7rr8,1,t5_3gttb
9613319,0,t3_5co437,Is your base in a deep ocean biome?  If so the Cyclic mod is to blame.

9757580,0,t1_dafdnnf,Actually Soulbound is pretty common to find on mob dropped armor or just vanilla enchanting. You can transfer it to to a book with the Actually Additions Atomic Reconstructor equipped with a Disenchanting Lens.,HermitPack,dafu95f,3,t5_3gttb

10010140,0,t3_5j0jp7,Yea those allow you to spawn the ender dragon. Just place one crystal on each side of the end portal  total. ,HermitPack,dbccm83,5,t5_3gttb
10028467,0,t3_5jaquq,Not sure why this is a problem however if I had to guess why this is happening I would say it is Javas garbage collection kicking in.,HermitPack,dbeqjha,0,t5_3gttb
10067247,0,t3_5jxy65,Am I thinking of OpenComputers? I thought I saw something like that on one of the hermits channels where youd just give it a jpg URL and it displays the photo on the screen,HermitPack,dbjsa8r,1,t5_3gttb
10096629,0,t3_5k901w,Im getting a lot of that behavior too. Im still trying to figure out if its my configuration running the server in a VM or if theres something in the pack causing it. MemoryCPU isnt an issue. I think it started happening with hermitpack ..,HermitPack,dbnlsz0,1,t5_3gttb

10269443,0,t3_5mo9zp,SOoooooo... any word on whether or not TechReborn is you know usable now?  Ive had problems ever since Hermitpack genesis and it was kind of a relief to see Biffa have issues as well.,HermitPack,dc83iv4,1,t5_3gttb

10570577,0,t1_dd62hz6,I built one solar panel and immediately switched back to Geothermal Generators. I thought they may have been useful like in other modpacks Ive seen but like you said it doesnt scale well into the later tiers. I might look into Yellorium generators as I have a metric ton of the stuff either unmined in my quarry or just resting in ore or Uranium form in my storage modules.,HermitPack,dd69srm,1,t5_3gttb

11597764,0,t3_5akm3v,Sry for the necro but found this when I was trying to fix this issue. A work around is putting a hopper under the Vac chest then putting the transfer node on the hopper.,HermitPack,dgam5gr,2,t5_3gttb
