1014062,0,t1_chj8xrt,Hey! uOttawa does not specialize in musical theatre but we do have some great theatre profs and courses available to first years. Those courses should be available to you through Rabaska with the course code THE and a minor is available also  If you ever have any trouble with registration calling the facultydropping by is your best bet to get into programs you want! Also we have a great club called Broadway Off Broadway which does a big musical production every year you can find them here  and the great thing about doing it as an extra curricular is that you meet people from various other programs and also have elective room for anything else which may interest you in academic fields  Katya,uOttawaEcon,chjk0yo,1,t5_30bm3
