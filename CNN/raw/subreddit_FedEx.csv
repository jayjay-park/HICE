10215925,0,t1_dc1hnhb,Yeah I guess its not too farfetched that both our packages followed the same path. My phone broke so Im waiting for my replacement to arrive. Waiting on this package has been difficult knowing its only a  minute drive away  and FedEx said Im unable to pickup the package at their warehouse. ,FedEx,dc216vn,1,t5_2r73z
