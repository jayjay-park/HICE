10612436,0,t1_dcs7eyc,Try to stick it out it took me a couple months to get out of the funk sertraline put me in when I first started it. The Nausea was pretty crazy my doctor recommended me maybe taking my dose at night instead of in the AM so I could just sleep it off. Tremors most definitely. Jitters need to move that sucked also. I twitch a lot now not sure if thats a side effect or something or just me. ,SSRIs,ddalbf8,1,t5_2yhc1
