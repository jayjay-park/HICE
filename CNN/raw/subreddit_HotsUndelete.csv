11741464,0,t3_67jr2p,gtSo yesterday in TL I had the opportunity to play against ArcLord a Bronze  NA player former Bronze  player and current streamer. I did so using Raynor one of the easiest characters in the game. I ended the game with about k xp for my team. We loss pretty convincingly.gt  gtThis isnt to cry or to say ArcLord played amazingly well.  He played a decent Gazlowe and was middle of the charts in hero damage. That said it confirmed to me that Im artificially too high in my MMR and that I cant lose in QM and HL enough because my teams are so good that its a slot machine pull as to whether or not my teammates are professional players or are preparing to go progtgt  gtCase in point same day I loss to the bronze player in the game with one of the easiest heroes in the game I was carried by my teammates in HL after I picked Lili against a comp that pretty much demanded me to last pick a tank they had Chromie Jaina Probius and BW... like seriously. They proceeded to say nice things and encourage me the entire first half of the game although I had switched from Muradin to Lili... allowed me to play solo lane... and the top lane remained empty for the enemy team the entire game because mine kept ganking him. This despite me dying in the top lane about once a minute.gtgt  gtI basically want to confirm to you that you can lose to the worst players in the game the Bronze players and still climb the HL ladder because you cant make your allies decisions. Theres gotta be some way to drop to the lower levels of matchmaking other than intentionally feeding in hundreds of games over months trying to drag down  of teams across the line who will do their best to carry the game v. In  man TL its  on you and your allies you picked... but in HL youre contributing at best  of the outcome to each game. I watch Bronze streams and can only imagine how much fun this game would be if I wasnt force to play nearly every game with some allies who are way above my level.gtgt  gtAnywho... there ya go. Im sure others are experiencing this same thing.gtgt  HotsLogs Match History to Prove I feed a lot gtgtThis post is a reference to this although it isnt too far from the truth.  I average like  deaths a game lose to Bronze players in TL and am GM.gtgt,HotsUndelete,dgqxayd,1,t5_3ftlv
