There does need to be some allowances for unique experiences that can be provided by talented teachers.Im not so sure that teaching to the test is a real problem however.  Id think of that more as teaching the necessary things that experts agree need to be taught.

1364290,0,t1_cimpr7a,Hi. Ive been in cable for over a decade mostly here. I have system prints for everything Comcast services from Brunswick to Welaka Melrose Lake City etc. and work a little over half of the serviced area. Im not the guy that comes to your house when you set up service or have a problem anymore they dont get to have them There is a metric that is strongly looked at by any Major Service Operator and that is customers per mile. One could define that as how many possible accounts exist per mile of mainline that would need to be built in order to service them. We dont look too good when you look at the area as a whole. Good luck to any company willing to run fullservice infrastructure downtown. How much phonecable stuff do you see there while walking around? Yeah its tucked under the streets and sidewalks in a vaultconduit system. That increases cost to build immensely especially if there isnt much room although I dont personally know how packed those duct banks and such are here. That being said there are huge areas with good CPM ratios here but any incoming service would have to take the whole deal. We also have more rural areas with very low CPM ratios. Theres also areas with split governmental jurisdiciton like Baldwin and certain Beaches areas. Then theres some apparent need to cover nearby cities too. Back on costtobuild even though we do still have quite a few areas with poles and aerial utilities much of the new construction is underground here a service method that increases costs by nearly double. There are also areas where we already have  or  companies on a pole and in that case more than one of them are already fiber. Comcast has fiber all over the place. ATT does too. Theres also Level and TWtelecom fiber in plenty of places. The reason I bring this up is because of the obvious need for space to put new equipment but also that there is a competition factor  many people will simply not switch over even with only one other provider available. Its becoming more generally known that companies like Comcast wont overbuild more than one competitor and for good reason. If they or Google or anyone else can put their investments in areas where they can blindly get a rough  penetration just by being there why bother with places where that figure drops to ?,jacksonville,cinaxez,0,t5_2rhkx

1423877,0,t3_2afa6h,Yes the  Million did supplement for most of the two main scoreboards. But thats not all it paid for the stadium went from sqft of video screen space to sqft of screen space for the ENTIRE stadium. Lets not forget the many other upgrades the stadium is seeing during this time. Everyone has to remember that EverBank Field does not just house the Jaguars. There are plenty of other events that happen regularly there and the stadium must evolve in order to stay relevant. Everyone is complaining that the city is spending money to upgrade the stadium while NO ONE was complaining when the city built the thing in the first place. Shaad Kahn has invested just as much money into the JagsCity almost as much as we have with our tax dollars. No one complained when he spent  million to renovate the Jags locker room none of us will probably ever see that place in person. The city built the place that means the city has an obligation to keep it relevant. Dont like it? Move to a place where the city doesnt have as much invested in their team.

1502266,0,t3_2bcxbf,Being stationed at NAS Jax you will hit traffic no matter HOW you try to come into the base. Orange Park always has bad traffic and poor drivers. Otherwise it is a nice area. Stay away from rd. Mandarin is a nice area but as others have said the Buckman bridge is horrible for traffic at rush hour. Then again so is Hwy Roosevelt near the base. Basically when dealing with NAS traffic is going to be bad.... Riverside is a really nice area to live in but be prepared for a little flooding. depending on rate you could get all sorts of places to rent in SanMarco. Beautiful safe and fun. My favorite dog park is Dogwood Park best beaches... none are really pretty but the farther south you go the better try Ponte Vedra Beach. Access the river? EVERYWHERE. When you arrive do a search for boat ramp on your phones map. Youll understand what I mean. Shopping Higher end would be the St Johns Town Center. More Country shops would be River City Market Place. My favorite mall is The Avenues on the Southside nice mix or high end and cheap stores. There are lots of places for day hiking camping etc as well. Remember Jacksonville is made to help you spend your money if you love shopping and eating you will love it here.

So HROs are needed legislation to fill the gaps where constitutions are silent. The reason that people can be fired for voicing political opinions is that the st amendment protects Americans from government intrusion on free speech rights. Private employers can fire you for any reason or none at all in Florida since we are a right to work state. I am in favor of beefing up st amendment protections for private employment but we would need legislation such as the HRO to better protect peoples rights.,jacksonville,czh451c,16,t5_2rhkx
