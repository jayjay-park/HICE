419742,0,t3_1yu3dh,Pretty rad article. If were going to keep growing Hattiesburg weve got to be able to offer the things people want to see in a growing city. Down town revitalization is pretty hot trend nationwide right now and Ill all for it. I only moved here  years ago for college but Im proud to call this city my home and Id love to see it continue to grow. Its going to take pretty much every one working together. The city government the businesses the universities and the citizens. The citizens especially have the most responsibility. If we cant get out there and make new business succeed or help keep current ones open the city becomes atrophic. ,hattiesburg,cfo9sps,3,t5_2sgsr
