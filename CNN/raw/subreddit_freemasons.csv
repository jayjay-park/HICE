First off his memorabilia may well be of great interest to the lodge that he belonged. Outside of that lodge it probably wont be of much interest like an old matchday programme for Arsenal wont be of much interest to a Leeds United fan. Within his belongings is likely to be a summons or some other paperwork that tells you what lodge he belonged to. If it isnt too old then there will still be contact details for other people in the lodge but your first port of call will be the Secretary. If you tell him that your grandfather has passed away and has left some masonic belongings they may well want to know more about them.    If you are unable to locate any paperwork you will need to contact the Provincial Lodge. This will depend on where you live but this will most likely be based on the county you live in like the Provincial Grand Lodge of West Lancashire for example. They can help you locate his old lodge.    If you want to know more about freemasonry in general then the United Grand Lodge of England has a good website with more info www.ugle.org.uk.    As for your grandfather by virtue of being a freemason you can be assured that he was held in high esteem by many people. He will have spent many years as a good man trying to be better as we all are. I wish you success. ,freemasons,daibcqu,5,t5_2r4xt
