4771066,0,t3_3g7tgn,The first of his works? American Gods is his third novel I believe. His first novel was Good Omens cowritten with Terry Pratchett. His second novel was Neverwhere which was a novelization of the Neverwhere TV show he did for the BBC. Both of those books are excellent by the way and if you liked American Gods there are two short stories that continue with Shadow and Anansi Boys which is kind of a sequel though it is really just set in the same world and can be read as a standalone story.Sorry I cant help much with the paper. I mostly listen to unabridged audio now and read things on my Kindle.  I do have a bunch of first edition hardbacks of my favorite authors but for years now Ive really just had them on display in my bookcase and then get the audiobook version to listen to.,neilgaiman,ctvxp0n,3,t5_2slf5

6349085,0,t3_42lone,I live in California so theres nothing that is very old. But I think at least for southern California it would be the Cabazon Dinosaurs off highway . Called the worlds biggest dinosaurs but they are basically ignored because they are right next to an outlet mall. They even come with their own strange little theme park that is super rundown and totally bizarre. I love it so much. Or there is Calico ghost town. Ive never been but apparently its a real mining town that sprung up during the gold rush and is now a teeny little pit stop tourist trap.,neilgaiman,czbbjj8,4,t5_2slf5
