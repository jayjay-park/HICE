1343859,0,t1_ciks891,Unfortunately you have been misinformed. It seems that the brands that everyone seems to think are the greatest thing out there tend to be some of the worst. I dont know if Science Diet is available where you live but in the states Science Diet is recommended by every vet Ive been to. The truth is they sell it at the vets office and they get a little money out of the deal and its got to be some of the worst food out there.When my GSD was still a pup I dutifully fed what the vet recommended. We always thought it was a little strange that this growing active puppy hardly ate a thing and was far more interested in cat food. I went to visit my parents and he devoured an entire bowl of the Beneful that they feed their dog. We figured it was better to feed him something he would eat than trying to coax him to eat enough. I dont think it had so much to do with the type of food but that he was finally eating enough to get the nutrition he needed. The poop eating stopped along with quite a few other nasty and annoying behaviors. But who could blame him. The poor guy was starving. Check the ingredients list. Try to avoid some of the fillers like corn and wheat and anything that includes the words byproduct. Thats just code for nasty stuff we cant find any good use for so well just feed it to dogs. Do some research so you know what to look for and read the ingredients and nutrition information on the dog food. Dont be afraid to try some things. Buy a small bag see if he likes it and see if it helps. Best of luck! ,germanshepherds,cikssq9,1,t5_2s83q

2263792,0,t1_clrigpk,gt I had to lay on top of her with all my weight to get a paw done.Ooo stop doing that. By forcing her into trimming her nails youre just showing her that grooming is a scary experience. Always always start slow. Heres a good video on how to get your dog to be accustomed to grooming. You can always ask the dog wash if they would allow you to just come in and test it out a couple of times. See when theyre the least busy so you wont be taking the spot of a paying customer and just associate the building with happy things see treats. Once the pup is happy about going to the dog wash start really slowly like just getting her paws wet on the lowest setting. Id imagine most dog washes would be totally fine with you getting your dog used to the process gradually. If you makes you feel better my guy is incredibly vocal and howled almost the entire time he got his first bath there. Even when he was enjoying it and leaning into the water he was still making some kind of noise. Not sure how the other customers felt but the guy that owned the dog wash just thought it was hilarious. So no worries about throwing a fit! Just try to make it as enjoyable for your pup as possible. ,germanshepherds,clriwdj,1,t5_2s83q

3021648,0,t1_coav8mx,Ive gotten this question while walking my shepherd before and its a combination of reasons.While they look mean the prong or pinch training collars are actually safer for dogs who aggressively pull versus standard flat collars.  Though you need to find one that doesnt have the ends flat cut off as those have sharp points which can cause damage.  Rounded points like on a Hermm Springer spelling collar are required as these will not cause damage under pulling situations.With a flat or even chain training collar an aggressive puller can collapse their tracheawindpipe leading to an emergency vet visit.  This style of collar focuses the pressure on points instead of a flat band so it essentially is the exact opposite of a choke collar.Also the discomfort felt from pulling against this versus a flat collar isnt from lack of the ability to breathe.  Instead it causes some pinching and thus corrects the pup before they try to hurt themselves.  I tried the collar on my arm to ensure I wasnt hurting my pup even with a hard pull it isnt painful just uncomfortable.So yes they look mean but for leash reactive and aggressive pullers they work and are safer for the pup.  And remember they are training collars.  So the goal is to have it where the pup moves off onto a harness or other item once they have learned how to loose leash walk.,germanshepherds,cob6w3q,2,t5_2s83q

My breeder drove down there to pick her up. The sire came from a supposedly reputable breeder who never sent the papers to my breeder but is Czech. Daisys line can be traced back for generations on her papers but where Sarges papers were never sent hes the first on his side of the registry. My breeder did explain that the NKC has a bad reputation because of puppy mills but he also explained why they were through it and how he was working on getting AKC papers for the dam after he had given Sarge to a fellow officer who wanted a Shepherd.,germanshepherds,cqmsnx5,1,t5_2s83q

Youve stated your girlfriends dog got in fights with previous household dogs so why  are you expecting things to be any different with a new dog? I would seriously hold off on getting a new one until you are convinced the other one has been fully rehabilitated and trained. Otherwise every time you leave them alone the though in the back of your head is going to be is this the day my girlfriends dog at attacks my Shepherd? To introduce a new one just seems like you are setting your girlfriends dog up to fail. ,germanshepherds,d4sg6zi,2,t5_2s83q

8180745,0,t3_4rd8g0,gtGets on soapbox about weight while using examples of dogs in a forced stack which displays how weve bred them to be full of hipback issues.Good post with good info...just find that a bit ironic. gtIf your dog is actually at this healthy weight youll get your fair share of your dog is too skinny! and are you actually feeding that thing?Yea people have lost their sense of what a healthy weight is. Plus you have the issue that owners want to force their thoughtsopinions on their dog like its how things should be. A good example is food. People see things like liver by products xxx meal and they freak out just because it doesnt sound palatable to them. In reality though there is nothing wrong with those ingredients at all. In a lot of cases owners need to take a step back and realize that the health needs of their pet dont perfectly align with what they think is healthy. gt Also just like in humans excess weight can cause other health problems and just plain shortens life spans.Exactly. Its always better to be too thin than to be too big. ,germanshepherds,d5055ek,6,t5_2s83q

9421562,0,t1_d99eyl3,Eve and Elias wrestled a lot and would lie on the floor heads pointed towards each other and make wookie noises while pawing each other and biting each others faces  not to cause pain but in play. We let them do it but monitored it so that neither puppy hurt the other by accident. There were lots of teeth showing but it was never aggressive or mean between them.As for the littermate symptoms those came a little later around the four month old mark. At first they were easy to train sit wait toilet train eating without getting possessive of food etc.. Eve in particular was and probably still is very motivated by food Eli is more motivated by wanting to please but they were coming along and learning nice manners.But around the fourfive month mark they would simply ignore basic commands get super whiny and anxious if separated  both of them destroyed things to get to where the other dog was including breaking out of their crates at night which could have been harmful and were backsliding into mouthing and nipping people the way they did as very young puppies. That only got worse. By the end they rarely responded to our commands because they were so wrapped up in each other and they were getting a little aggressive toward other dogs at the park and would work in tandem to bully other dogs partly stemming from an incident where Eve was picked on by an older bigger dog and Eli went to her aid and chased him off. We knew then we had to separate them because if they hurt another dog or a person trying to get their dog away from them we could be in a lot of trouble or even forced to surrender them to be destroyed.When they were apart they were better behaved and you could remind them of their training and theyd catch on pretty quick but together they were a nightmare. Eve started eating poo and took her stress out on all the rugs in the house pooping on them after months of no accidents and chewing them and an antique armoire Eli displayed stress by vomiting whining A LOT and eating Eves poop. So yeah not good.Now that Eve is rehomed she stopped eating poo almost immediately she is no longer destructive she did apparently pull some eyelet lace off her new owners blouse but thats it and the new owner said it was an improvement. Shes happy and eager to please and learn and loves to cuddle with her new family and is great with kids and other dogs.Eli is more confident and he also stopped eating poo when Eve left and his confidence is high now he no longer walks with a bowed head because Eve isnt there to be dominating toward him or keeping him from receiving affection from us she hated Eli getting any attention.I dont mean all this to scare you but I would say that if you start seeing these symptoms get on it right away and DO NOT blame yourself for their behaviour. All you can do is whats best for the dogs and if that ends up being to rehome one that does not make you a failure as a dog owner. Littermate syndrome is hard to correct once the behaviour is entrenched so dont feel like you did everything wrong if it happens. Just do what whats best for them and results in happy healthy welladjusted dogs and youll do ok.,germanshepherds,d9a8xs1,2,t5_2s83q
9435374,0,t3_59uzxm,Once you have her sitting on command you can work on catching a ball. With my GSD pup I had him sit then I gave the command catch and carried the ball through the air toward him and let him take it from my hand. I began doing this while rather close to him and slowly moved a bit further away from him to where I was doing an underhand very slow pitch to him. This technique is called approximation and each time he took the ball or later caught the ball he received praise. I do warn you that this will take some time and a great deal of patience on your part but your dog should get the idea and begin to play with you.Getting down on the floor or ground with the dog is a good thing as well. You can even pretend to mouth a toy to show the dog play. Remember dogs understand body language and there is an invitation to play position for dogs. For you to initiate play get on the floor on your hands and knees. Now this is going to sound strange but watch dogs and you will see this next behavior. While on your hand and knees you move your forearms to the floor with a bit of a slap on the floor while keeping you butt in the air. Dogs will keep their hind quarters elevated while going down on their front legs and most often slapping the floor with one or both front legs. Now it is play time so enjoy rolling on the floor and playing with a pull toy or ball or whatever you have for toys.If you have access to a dog swimming pool you might want to take your new girl to the pool. Water is great for older dogs and people too In my community there is a dog swimming pool and the staff take time to check the dogs to make sure they are ok in the pool and this is done as a one on one with the staff member and one dog. If you have access to such a facility talk with them about the history of your girl and they may be able to give her some individual pool time. I get a wading pool for my boy in the summer and he loves digging the water out of the pool faster than I can get it in.Femur bones are great for big dogs and can keep the dogs busy and happy for quite a while. I know some people give their dogs raw bones but I choose to do a slow roast of the bones since they are marrow bones and tend to be smelly and greasy in short order. The slow roast I do is in a  degree Fahrenheit oven for about  hours. If the bones are really greasy I will drain the grease out of the pan and continue roasting. I do remove the marrow and it is a special treat in my dogs food. I do not get the bones with a ball joint as the joint is easily splintered when the dog chews the bone. Some people feel that cooking the bones makes them splinter but I have found this method does not produce a bone that splinters. I do know that boiling the bones will produce a bone that will splinter so I would avoid that method of cooking. Your girl is accustomed to raw meat since she was raised with wolves so a raw bone might be ok for her.,germanshepherds,d9bzznj,1,t5_2s83q

11039625,0,t3_5xk0f8,My  month old does this. She will whine until we let her lay on our pillows between us. It was cute when she weighed  or  lbs. Not so cute now when you have an  lb dog plop down on your head. ,germanshepherds,dejbloe,1,t5_2s83q

11423172,0,t1_dfqdaxf,Me too. Artoo has become quite the ninja since the baby was born. But the ninja skills are all geared towards the goal of licking baby toes. This time he just boldly walked right into my shot and went for the face. The focus is awful but Im glad I caught something. Theyre too cute.,germanshepherds,dfqszu8,2,t5_2s83q

11532230,0,t3_64kd3k,Yikes! Im glad the kitty broke it up. My animals are the same. If two fights the third goes crazy and breaks it up. My GSD went after my cat a little too rough a few months ago still playing mode but scared my cat and my other cat went crazy and tried beating the dog senseless. My boyfriend tried breaking it up but also got beat by the cat. I had to go calm the cat down while my boyfriend protected my GSD. Ive always gotten shelter cats but have only adopted one shelter dog who I later returned within a month for unabated cat aggression. I find that not raising a big dog from when heshe is a puppy makes the dog much less predictable. People always give me a lecture about dog breeders and how Im making the situation in the shelters worse but I would rather be safe than sorry.,germanshepherds,dg36i5d,17,t5_2s83q

11578003,0,t1_dg8dbzj,Oh for sure! I grew up with two female GSDs and they were great. But up until last year we had my boyfriends dog who was a chowRottweiler and he was kind of a jerk who didnt like other dogs or kids really so its nice to have a sweet and lovable dog again.,germanshepherds,dg8dfmq,1,t5_2s83q
