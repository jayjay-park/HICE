7039106,0,t3_4bi9c6,Yes anyone in the Mafia has to be extremely careful about what they say because of the nature of them being criminals.An associate who is on the record under a specific solider has to follow their rules and they can get killed for going against their superior. For example if an associate is told to kill someone they themselves can be murdered for not declining the order.,Mafia,d1e8mbf,1,t5_2rhkv
7586944,0,t1_d34ko1v,I honestly do not have the time to argue with you endlessly.  gtI never once said I trust reporters. I simply said he is paid for information. Thats it. In a free market people can provide a product and be compensated for it.We can go on and on about the free market I dont believe it exists. This is an entirely different topic that we can discuss endlessly so we will unfortunately have to agree to disagree here.gtYou failed to mention my point regarding tvs or books.. or how about mafia documentaries?These are all companies profiteering off of the victims of crime. By law a criminal cannot profit from their crimes yet these people can. For most its a grey area for me it isnt. If criminals cant then nobody can. Journalism has fallen so far that these people are licking their lips as soon as they hear about a murder jumping at the chance to interview the victims relatives. Its sick depraved and just because these people are fed to you through a screen it is somewhat acceptable. It isnt. Everything I viewed was for free on youtube or streaming websites. The few books that I bought for instance The Iceman were so full of total bullshit that I could not even consider giving these people any more money.gtThey according to you are feeding off victims.And with your last statement youve truly shown how naive you are. You think every victim of the mafia was some guy who owed them money? What about the shops that have to pay protection money? What about the BILLIONS of taxpayer and private money wasted due to their schemes?  the balls to do it Absurd.This all ties in to my original point. If a criminal cant legally make money off of crime why are these people allowed to? At least the criminal did something. It might be completely abhorrent and reckless but they did that action. These people went and spoke to the criminal and are now making money from it at the expense of the victims. It is fundamentally wrong to take advantage of people like that to turn a buck simple as that.Are you going to comment on anything other than this? I have studied LCN for a long time read a lot online watched a lot of documentaries from its founding to what is present. I am particularly interested in the modern mob. I dont glorify these people anywhere near as much as these selfproclaimed experts do. I simply want facts and information. I didnt see any new information brought to the table by Scott Burnstein he just seems like another profiteer. What is your opinion on his utterances?,Mafia,d34lk4a,0,t5_2rhkv

It does help people justify good and bad things though. Joel Olsteen is rolling in cash in the name of God. Somebody shot up planned parenthood in the name of God. Suicide bombings in the name of God etc... If you feel like youre a soldier of God  or a child of God you can justify anything good or bad. In the name of God. Dont forget that most criminals donate to religion since religion is super prevalent in low income areas. Helps them feel better about there wrong doings or what not. Shit the sand creek massacre of Indians was in the name of God. Damn any man who sympathizes with Indians! ... I have come to kill Indians and believe it is right and honorable to use any means under Gods heaven to kill Indians. ... Kill and scalp all big and little nits make lice.Col. John Milton ChivingtonWhat Im getting at is its easy to justify running a sports book and juicingbeating up a debtor because he owes you thousands of dollars. Takes food off of your families table. So forget God get your money and thank him for the food at dinner. Pretty much the way it works.,Mafia,d590hjy,1,t5_2rhkv
