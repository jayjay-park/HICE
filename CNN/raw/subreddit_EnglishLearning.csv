1832865,0,t3_2fjv6x,It means that someone is free to go wherever they want in the land in question. For instance you could also say that your cat has the run of the house and it means the cat can go wherever it wants in the house  you havent put up barriers or stopped it going in any rooms etc. As far as I understand it this expression has nothing to do with prosperity or favourable conditions or anything like that it refers specifically to freedom of movement.For context I am a native Australian English speaker so usage may vary for other dialects.,EnglishLearning,cka1yxe,3,t5_2u8ap

2959102,0,t3_2u1r0s,Alright so my ability to answer your question depends on the kind of answer youre looking for. If youre asking about their use in situations where absolute grammatical correctness is important as in youre writing a dictionary or some kind of grammar textbook then Im not sure. The sources I looked at contradicted each other but it seems like the majority of grammar experts prefer me neither as a shortened form of Neither do I. They also said the me either could be used in the middle of a sentence but not on its own. When it comes to everyday speech in everyday situations at least here in the US however your friend is correct the two phrases are almost entirely interchangeable and using one in place of the other would never come across as odd to a native speaker. There may be situations where one sounds better than the other and you could always use neither do I although it might be a bit too fancy in some situations but to be perfectly honest with you I dont really think about when to use which one I just say whichever one feels right at the time.Theres also the possibility that Ive just been wrong about this my entire life so if anyone feels the need to enlighten me then feel free to do so. ,EnglishLearning,co4gq6j,2,t5_2u8ap

7459307,0,t1_d2ppix0,Keep in mind that Im not a linguist or English teacher just a native speaker who is happy to help out but Ill do my best to explain these things as clearly as I can.. Here share in and share are both grammatically correct but they mean different things. If they shared her humiliation they would feel humiliated as well but if they shared IN her humiliation they are taking part in it experiencing her humiliation and possibly adding to it. The implication here is that they might be entertained by her humiliation.. Its been a long time since Ive seen it but I believe in the movie a teenager is given a cute furry creature as a pet and told not to feed it after midnight. Either that creature or another creature is eventually fed after midnight which causes it to transform into a murderous monster.. Keep in mind that here she says I like drive... not Id like to drive.... Its not something she wants to do just something that she does. You may know this but in American English like is a very common filler word. Many people myself included are guilty of using it too often. Anyway the out of my way section actually serves an important function here. If Im going out of my way to do something it means that I am traveling an extra distance or putting in extra effort in order to achieve something. Here Anna is ashamed of eating at Taco Bell and doesnt want to be seen eating inside so she drives out of her way to find one with a drive through so she wont have to walk in the restaurant. You could convey the same information without this useful phrase but using it makes it clear that she has to drive an extra distance in order to avoid feeling ashamed. ,EnglishLearning,d2q2rml,2,t5_2u8ap

So you fly to Florida ready to go to the beach. Youre thinking the timeshare presentation will be  minutes.

Found the simple explanation on StackExchangeWhat happened  Past Simple What had happened  Past Perfect What has happened  Present Perfect. So this is a matter of Past Simple vs. Past Perfect and as it turns out the correct one to use in this case is Past Perfect. Past Simple is for single events in the past whereas Past Perfect is for when youre talking about a sequence of events in the past.So! According to this rule since its been established that the president HAD suddenly passed away you will then use how it happened rather than how it HAD happened because you wondering about it comes AFTER finding out the president passed and the would you HAVE waited bit.

11314140,0,t3_61fw7b,I think if you really want to perfect your accent you have to work very specifically on pronunciation. Just talking to native speakers wont get you there IMO because A youll reach a point where youre perfectly intelligible but still have an accent and youll never have any incentive to improve from there and B You wont realize that your pronunciation is off because youll hear two sounds as the same when they actually sound different to a native speaker.I dated a girl who wasnt a native English speaker and her English was great but her accent was still just as distinct after living with me for years. Sometimes Id try to coach her on how to say something but in her mind she was already saying exactly what I was saying. A skilled accent coach no idea what theyre called would know how to teach those distinctions in a way that makes sense to the learner. I think if you were really dedicated you could probably use IPA as the other user suggested with sound clips and pronunciation videos to get pretty far as well.Take this all with a huge grain of salt since Ive never mastered another language but thats just my two cents.,EnglishLearning,dfefufr,3,t5_2u8ap
