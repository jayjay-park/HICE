11028065,0,t3_5xffz5,How old are you? Have you had any suicide attempts in the past? Are your parents and therapists aware you self harm? If you want to stop and face your demon you will have to be honest with them unfortunately. They have the capacity to help you. It really comes down to how much you let them help you. Hospitals and treatment centers are hard but might be necessary. The common treatment goal for self harm is to be free of urges. To do that you obviously have to be honest with yourself and with your treatment team staff about EVERYTHING. you are experiencing.Acute care hospitals are about showing your capacity to behave in a healthy psychological way and being able to keep that routine in some formwith the goal to keep that behavior when you leave and go home with the help of the correct medication. Its a stepping stone so dont expect to be completely cured. You probably know of more effective coping mechanisms than cutting you just arent good at them now. A hospital will allow you to practice those in a safe environment and get good at them. If you focus on that you will see yourself stop cutting as much.Also hidden and repeatedly open wounds can very quickly become infected. The deeper they are the more risky an infection would be. Make sure you are at least treating it with Neosporin or an antibacterial cream.Keep your head up and know that change just takes a little self discipline and motivation. You seem to already have the motivation.,Radical_Mental_Health,dei08de,1,t5_2vomi
