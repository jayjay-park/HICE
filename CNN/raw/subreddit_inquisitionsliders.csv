2718725,0,t3_2r7bcx,This is my first real character creation. I was actually trying to model it after Chloe Moretz but ended up with something else instead. Hope you like it! ,inquisitionsliders,cnd3vnv,1,t5_353v7
2720111,0,t3_2qfh2u,I really like her! She looks wonderful. I see too many dolllike female elves with very delicate features tiny noses tiny pointed chins insanely huge eyes etc and I am always pleased when people create characters with more realistic and prominent features. ,inquisitionsliders,cnd9jpg,2,t5_353v7

2897342,0,t3_2tb470,I could be wrong but from what Ive read right now there are only a few things that can be edited with the file mostly colors because they are easier. The shape of the face and the hairstyle are not modified at all. It is really useful for fixing makeup and etc that ended up different than you thought it would look.Once the tool is improved to be more comprehensive and stable I can totally see the value especially in a game that has already been started. Ill probably mess around it when you can swap whole faces.,inquisitionsliders,cnxfl6w,4,t5_353v7

4589960,0,t1_ct0gyp1,  Both hair colors not sure if I like the white or blackblue better? Your thoughts? I hope you still think shes pretty! Her makeuptattoo coloring is the same in both versions just looks different due to lighting. ,inquisitionsliders,ct95shq,2,t5_353v7
4592535,0,t1_ct95shq,Hmmm yeah thats a tough call. Id probably be swapping them back and forth all the time in game.  She looks good with both though! Thanks for the ingame shots. ,inquisitionsliders,ct9he9g,2,t5_353v7
