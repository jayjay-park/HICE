7417994,0,t1_d2ks2r1,There is no set time requirements but everyone on the clan plays probably  hours a weeks not because we force ourselves to but because we all enjoy playing together. everyone has jobs school or kids and grown up stuff to do but everyone in the clan loves spending most of their free time playing crucible. Your stats wont be the deciding factor. If you run solo or play a lot of sweats generally your stats will be low. if you only play public games with a set team all the time your stats will be high. so playing sweats with us will be more of a factor though its nice to see someone stats.Science has proven that tbagging while reviving increases the revive rate and the hilarity of the situation. We as a general rule dont tbag others or act disrespectful or send hate msgs to people. if someone i bagging you all round and you kill them to win the match sure return the favor. Any game with multiplayer or competitive play will result in most people being toxic most clans like BSK Primal and ourselves might joke around or even get heated to each others teammates during competitive matches but still keep a chill mentality and show everyone respect regardless of skill or the weapon they use everyone plays and enjoys the game differently.,CrucibleDestiny,d2ldmd3,1,t5_35m69
