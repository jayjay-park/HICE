9817196,0,t3_5fix06,Hello! I am a high school senior moving on to college next year. In deciding what I want to major in I am trying to decide between computer science and genetic engineering. I know that computer science has had such a huge effect on our society and in our humans need not apply times it is a great area to go into but I also see seemingly infinite possibilities for genetic engineering. What is your opinion on where people my age should focus? The huge but still growing area of computer science or the infinite possibilities of genetic engineering?,Cortex,dan76a8,1,t5_2xfm4

10661277,0,t3_5sitz0,We have recently switched from Daily budget to pennies. Whats cool is that instead of adding your savings or losses from one day to the next as daily budget does  it spreads the difference across the month so this way you get much less variability. Example. Lets say your daily budget for a month is . In Daily budget if you didnt spend anything on a single day the next day you get . Whereas if you spent  the next day becomes . In pennies things are different. if your daily budget is  and you spend  the  is removed from the Total budget for the month and divided by the days remaining. so for example if you have  more days in the month total. the  are subtracted from  and total becomes  which is then divided by the remaining days  and your daily budget becomes    for the rest of the period. ,Cortex,ddfmocu,1,t5_2xfm4
