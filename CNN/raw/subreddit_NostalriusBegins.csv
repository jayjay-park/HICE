3907900,0,t3_353f1o,I usually PvP or level an alt for farming. I always have the character I raid with usually tankhealer and then I have an alt I use to farm. Its extra work but Ive played DPS in raids and I dont find it nearly as rewarding. In Vanilla to be the best you have to pick a focus... you can be great at one thing at a time unless you have to time to earn enough to constantly respec. These occasionally will overlap and you may have moderate success in PVP as raid spec or vice versa but if you want to be the best your spec must reflect your goals.,NostalriusBegins,cr1qhc3,1,t5_33zpm

5068445,0,t3_3kes0r,I think they should remain blizzlike as much as possible since thats what the original point of the server was. In retail people did not have much time to achieve certain things either like Rank  or the original mounts.

5993837,0,t3_3xjz2x,Technically in Vanilla both Prot Pallies and Feral Druids can tank. The problem is that its not optimal for raid teams so they typically dont bring them. The general mentality is nonWarrior tanks will slow down the raid in some way so why bring them?Prot pallies require a solid amount of setup to execute well most of which is gear and raid configuration. Even with the ideal setup however youll still run into aggro troubles when compared to a similarly established Warrior meaning raid DPS must slow down to accommodate the difference. Still there are typically some rather casual raiding guilds that enjoy the challenge of off builds. Molten Core and ZulGurub especially should be fine considered the ease of content. Blackwing Lair is a significant maybe though I can see you having success as an off tank for trash and AoE pulls. ,NostalriusBegins,cy5bmbj,5,t5_33zpm
5996498,0,t1_cy5nomi,Interesting suggestion but from my point of view this is not the purpose of Nostalrius and kind of defeats the point of Blizzlike. Its not an improvement of Vanilla its the exact recreation of it. ,NostalriusBegins,cy5o71n,4,t5_33zpm

I would be willing to pay but only for less than the current fee given how old the content is and the fact that no new content is being developed for it. I already paid my dues  years ago man.

7709757,0,t3_4kwzet,Its probably just coincidence. I said I wasnt going to buy it but damn was the game really fun. Me and my friend had been looking for low attention span type of game that isnt too grindy and short enough to not require an hour long commitment. Since were both csgo players but dont always have time for an hour long game. And tf had gotten really stale. The  out comes the beta it was everything we were hoping for. Personally not a big fan of the graphics but it seems to work well in attracting a large audience. ,NostalriusBegins,d3ijqc7,4,t5_33zpm

9440515,0,t1_d9ck1el,gt Because by launching a Vanilla server they immediately admit they failed when brainstorming for new expansions.How have they failed?
