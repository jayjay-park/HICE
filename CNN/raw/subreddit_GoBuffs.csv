4406552,0,t1_csmcg9h,Its too bad Craig Watts doesnt seem to want to flip right now for whatever reason hes giving us a ton of love and stopped giving UW any.  The time until an OV gives UW too much time to sway him with BS.  Hope we can still flip him then though..  Also hoping Julmisse is referencing a commit in the next couple days with his recent tweets.,GoBuffs,csmcplw,1,t5_38274
5122956,0,t3_3l0d5h,Normally Id agree with what youre saying but we have a serious  apathy problem right now with students. Anything that can give those kids a sense of camaraderie with each other to build our student fanbase back up and most importantly put butts in the seats Im all for it. ,GoBuffs,cv3iazq,1,t5_38274

6014964,0,t1_cy7xdw0,Good to know thanks for he info. Im clueless about TV scheduling but from pm on FS has garbage on the air and its all their own programming.  Seems like if you wait  mins you can televise cu penn st. We are all used to late PAC games and its Vegas. I really hope we turn down any future tournaments that cannot get games televised between two major programs. ,GoBuffs,cy837t1,1,t5_38274

6709077,0,t3_47h54p,We tried our hardest to lose those game. Is there something wrong with our conditioning? Is that why we always stall at the end of games? Every single time.,GoBuffs,d0d9y01,1,t5_38274
9143024,0,t1_d8ahhph,But this year is different because for the last  years or so we have had more talent than a team like Oregon State but we played down to them and made the games closelost at the end. This year so far at least we are really putting it on the teams that we should put it on CSU and OSU and learning how to win the close games. The team looks fast and for real.,GoBuffs,d8axzk1,2,t5_38274
