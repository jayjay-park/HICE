5056101,0,t3_3k4mdu,Im not a good player myself but Ill try to point out some things I noticed.  Firstly you shouldnt go for sideb so often. This chibirobo was pretty bad at punishing the move but the move is really easy to avoid and punish accordingly.  Secondly Captain Falcon is a combo driven character. Try to use more shorthop up airs or nairs to string your combos. Also his throws are nice combo starters so use that more often too.  Lastly I noticed you went for the dair spike to kill at least  of those stocks. In competitive it wont be as easy to land again this chibi robo was pretty bad at avoiding those but only spike in optimal situations.,SuperSmashFlash,cuvg95u,2,t5_2vpmp

I freaking hate Naruto I will stock anyone that tries to use him but Im not going to let him stop me from playing my favorite Smash characters.,SuperSmashFlash,d6kotem,2,t5_2vpmp

I dont understand why youre so butthurt about some characters that are in the game that you dont like. Youre not gonna accomplish anything with this.,SuperSmashFlash,d6soc3f,1,t5_2vpmp
