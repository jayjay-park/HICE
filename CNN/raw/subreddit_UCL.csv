3576415,0,t1_cpzv2f5,My main two reasons are that its cheaper and you dont have to have breakfast at a particular time Im a strong believer in the afternoon breakfast. Also having a kitchen is really handy not just for cooking meals we had parties baked cakes the kitchen was our social space. Another thing personally for me is apologies for the massive generalization and no offence to people who cant cook at all people who cant cook at all tend to be the people I dont fancy hanging around with. Not sure why it might be a maturity thing or a shared interest thing who knows. ,UCL,cpzxt13,3,t5_2s23m

10641822,0,t3_5s9pak,The medic community at ucl is amazing and theres a massive effort thats put into sport and societies here which really adds to your time at uni. You can talk about living in London its one of the best places to study in your clinical years internationally because of massive patient and case diversity. On top of that theres the intercalated Bsc to mention. Hope that helps if youve got any other questions just ask. ,UCL,dddmf6s,2,t5_2s23m
