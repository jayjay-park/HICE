I have my host port as my public ip and the appropriate ports forwarded to my Unraid IP but the OpenVPN container can not complete the connection test successfully. It appears as if the OpenVPN container is having trouble making a connection out  rather than in because the connection test tool doesnt even display an ip that it tested only that a connection could not be made.,unRAID,d3m6eze,1,t5_2sn94

8551551,0,t1_d6a3cwc,It is in RC as well and it definitely works as intended. I can easily saturate my Gigabit Ethernet with it. It removes the need to read from parity disks before writing to it but requires all disks to be spun up and read from.

10977047,0,t3_5wo7sp,Why should I waste perfectly good drives because they might maybe possibly be near the end of their life? If everything looks fine Im going to keep them going. The moment one shows any sign of an issue then it gets swapped. I have drives that are  years old and going strong. No plan on replacing them right now  although I am keeping an eye on them. From my experience and many many drives  years is way too short to replace them unless youre constantly using them.,unRAID,dec8cj4,8,t5_2sn94
11034540,0,t3_5xj3jx,OP relax on the temp concerns. Its easy to get hung up on a drive temp spiking because unraid likes to make a big deal about it. The rebuild is tough on drives during initial build. Parity is being calculated and in general the drive temps are going to spike. I assure you this is no higher or of anymore concern than if they were being built as a Spaces array in windows. The temp data is fetched from SMART so its the same. Give the array a chance to prove itself and to settle down. You should notice lower overall temps and also greater performance overall. In addition since unraid has better alerts youll notice spikes on your alerts these are normal as the defaults are pretty aggressive as Ive found.,unRAID,deiqnmw,3,t5_2sn94

11045002,0,t1_dejx9tn,I found it just by clicking on that icon i don remember doing anything to enable it per say.So my SSD cache wasnt moving files and it was getting many errors.I think its because it was already transferring to the array and I went in and changed it to Not use Cache causing it to get backed up. mover just finished.I went and change the drive back to using SSD cache and restarted mover. Now its emptying the cache correctly.I guess after this is done Ill go in and shut cache off until the  TB transfer is complete.Its transferring at MB right now so TB will definitely take some time.,unRAID,dejxjuu,2,t5_2sn94

11154383,0,t1_dewba19,If you are using the same container I am here After you gain confidence in how the container is running you may want to change the action from copy to move. FileBot will move the files from the input to the output directory then clean up any leftover junk in the input directory. If youre going to do this then its also probably a good idea to store temporary files and incomplete downloads in a different directory than the input directory just in case FileBot decides to move them.,unRAID,dewc5vp,1,t5_2sn94
