7635075,0,t1_d39yfzo,Well yeah. Archetypes sucks when writing characters. I can see why he did it. He wanted to create blank shapes for the different fans of the Blair Witch to identify as. At the time it made sense the problem is that decade later all that you have left is shit characters.Most movie easter eggs are by default put there for the foam at the mouth crowd to begin with. You forget that when the movie was made there were a lot of people obsessed with the Blair Witch people who wouldve notice some of the easter eggs then would go on to comb the whole movie for the rest. As such clues hidden in  frame of the film are a bit excessive but then I think that was kinda the point.And yeah the movie was never going to be a masterpiece but clearly it wasnt quickly thrown together sequel. The director wanted to make a movie about mass hysteria and submerging once self into a narrative until you loose your connection with reality and how people react and deal with it. Maybe it wouldnt have been a very good movie anyway but we will never know because the producers went out of their way to rape the movie. Dont get me wrong the producers having a bit of input about the project they are funding is normal. Heck the lack of supervision can lead to some great stinkers Star Wars . But what we have here is a band of megalomaniacal Paul marketing types who decided that they know better than the director and the writer of the movie had bunch of gore porn filmed and sprinkled without rime of reason trough out the film. The sheer contempt these people held for both the creator and the public is staggering. And it happens a lot in Hollywood. There is Exploring The Crow  on the same channel. Go watch that.This shit happens over and over again. And the reason why it continue to happens is that when the version of the movie released turns out to be a pile of shit the public blames the actors and the director for making a unwatchable train wreck and not the producer who had the original cut put under the knife ether because they thought they knew better than the director or to make more money short movies can be showed more times a day than a long movie and were cheaper to distribute. ,nostalgiacritic,d3a2dkb,0,t5_2tnb0
