Blackwing holds...great potential  but it has proven time and again that it cannot be contained. The Virus centers itself upon a host and from there it sends out tendrils of the force. This first host acts as a nexus point for an almost hivemind structure in which its cognitive powers are outsourced to the brainmatter of the various corpses it reanimates. Using the force patterns of Ysalamer lizards I have created a device that can block the tendrils from accessing the corpse thralls which can then be safely incenerated. This method should be able to keep the virus from spreading. The key to ending the infection however will be to kill whatever being the Virus has adopted as its host. It is this final task that I am still researching though I believe it may be possible to the virus connection to its thralls to locate the host.,EmpireDidNothingWrong,d05nlhm,1,t5_397yx

10257773,0,t3_5m356i,Citizens and soldiers of the Galactic Empire.It is with my utmost pride I am pleased to announce that Project Cockatrice has been completed.This Star Dreadnaughtclass craft measures twenty kilometers from bow to stern. I have made extensive modifications to the standard SSD hull. The cityscape on the dorsal hull has been minimized and covered with armor plating. This warship is designed primarily as a fleet carrier. I have removed its garrison as well as many of its turbolaser emplacements. It now boasts three ventral hangar bays and carries  squadrons of TIEIn SA D H ad rc and ag craft. As well as several landing shuttles gunboats and boarding craft. It possesses a small stormtrooper completement for boarding operations. The hull is painted black to reduce visibility against the starscape. It is also covered with bulges that further break up its silhouette. Each of these bumps contains a droid controlled TIE Raptor starfighter. Controlled from an advanced tactical supercomputer in the heart of the vessel. In the event of jamming each is designed to operate independently. The vessel is capable of deploying  of these fighters with  seconds of realspace reversion. Due to its decreased power requirements and weight it is faster and has stronger shields than a standard SSD. My vision for this vessel was one that would be able to terrify rebels into submission by its arrival alone. Not by some easily targeted superweapon but by sheer numbers and imposing image. Upon the arrival of this vessel I foresee our freezing in fear and finding themselves unable to move. For this I christen it the ISC Basilisk after the creature from Terran myth said to be able to kill with its eyes alone.Once again I would like to express my greatest thanks to uJabbaland for his generous contributions to the project and would like to invite he and Commodore uarkguardian to tour this vessel.Engineering disconnect umbilicals.
