133937,0,t1_cetnksp,gtThe point where I would disagree is the technical matter you use to judge the artwork as nice or bad. With this way of looking at art you will probably like Classical Realism a lot.Sure and I do.  On the other hand on a purely emotional level I dont like the piece... but I already made that clear when I said this does absolutely nothing for me..  I dont know what else to add to that or how to quantify it.  I do know how to quantify the technical aspects of it which I also found lacking... so I did.gtThe things you describe as bad are the same things that make this work so meaningful to me. While on one hand showing nearly everything of the girl Schiele also manages to leave space to the imagination of the viewer. I am intrigued by the contrast between the body and the face it seems like he is trying to show both sides of her in the same drawing The pretty side of the girl she was born like but at the same time the broken and depressed side of her created by the hard life of working on the streets of Vienna as a prostitute in .Sure and thats fine as an opinion and just as valid  important as mine.The real reason I posted was because there was absolutely nothing in the comments section when I looked and you would think that with  at the time upvotes someone would have said something.

2675112,0,t1_cn42hp9,I dont disagree. IMO Goya is overrated as an artist except the Black Paintings which may not even be his own work. His only real importance lies in his introduction of previously unseensuppressed subject matter like witchcraft and the horrible side of war. But as you say his technique isnt great.I think thats a major reason the Chapmans are so obsessed with his work. Since Goya prioritizes ideas over technical skill he could be considered a forerunner to conceptual art which they practice. They suggest that theres a link between Goya and Hitler namely that the quality of their art has nothing to do with their historical importance and it can therefore be altered without causing irreparable damage.,museum,cn7rc1s,1,t5_2rti0

It bears also no resemblance with the stylistically different Excersise One he painted.You also seem to focus merely on one point the rich colorness of the painting.

Sarah Bernhardt had seen this woman on the seashore and was moved by her story which ended tragically with the death of the child. But in Bernhardts sculpture the the childs right hand grips the womans garment perhaps suggesting the possibility of a more hopeful ending.gtThe artist allegedly took anatomy lessons specifically to convey the intensity of the subject. Her ability to render textures from smooth skin to rough nets adds to the naturalism of the piece. Bernhardts arrangement of the figures suggests her knowledge of works such as Michelangelos Pieta in which the Virgin Mary supports the dead Christ on her lap.gtWhen the large original plaster cast for this work was exhibited at the Salon in  it won a silver medal. Two years later the artist sold the rights to reproduce Aprs la tempte to the dealer Henri Gambard who appears to have commissioned very few duplicates.

3718555,0,t3_32zn1t,FitzAlan lived a unique political life serving in the highest ranking offices for every monarch from Henry VIII to Elizabeth I. That included at least two complete changes in the national church which were accompanied by purges of the elite. FitzAlan even signed his name to documents proclaiming Lady Jane Grey as the successor to Edward VI. Upon the young kings death Grey was proclaimed queen and held onto London for a couple weeks before Mary seized power with FitzAlan cunningly on her side and beheaded the teenage Grey.In other words FitzAlan played the game of thrones and won. He lived to be  and also had the great fortune to commission a prayer book that included this coat of arms. Strictly speaking I think the coat of arms is just the oval in the center with four quadrants so I presumably the rest of the image was largely left to the artists or artisans? discretion.The border references traditional illuminated manuscripts which often feature plants growing around the central image. But here the effect is less abstract pattern and more trompe loeil. The background also grabbed my eye because its a landscape showing a rather grubby looking patch of life in the foreground with distant Italianate blue hills. This puts it squarely in the British landscape tradition which from the thth Centuries was the most British form of art.Its tempting to think that FitzAlans main devotion was to the realm which was why he was always willing to serve whoever England chose as leader and in the th Century chose was surprisingly common. But this seems like a modern interpretation informed by th Century ideas of nationalism so perhaps its invalid as a result of being anachronistic. Or maybe FitzAlan was ahead of his time a man who lead the way to the modern era despite being totally of his time. And you see where this is going the same could be said of this paintings relation to the British landscape tradition.,museum,cqg53yl,1,t5_2rti0
3719063,0,t3_32zueu,For the most part my interest in de Hooch is in comparison to the slightly barely younger Vermeer  who according to Wikipedia was influenced by de Hooch de Hoochs generous lighting makes clear the subtlety of Vermeers sparse patches of light.Thats not to say de Hooch is a bad painter and at least on a narrative level he shows signs of genius. The woman handing her money to the servant is dense and hard to unravel.At first I thought the servant was the protagonist she clearly works hard torn between a demanding child and a lazy mistress. She also has the example of Venus pictured above the mantelpiece with her son Cupid to remind her of the life she could be leading if she didnt work also on the mantelpiece seem to be some pieces of fruit representing the passage of time and with it dwindling fertility.Then I thought maybe the young girl is the center. She is surrounded by role models the contrasting red and blue dresses of her mother and maid are both options for the girl currently dressed in white. Venus and Cupid are in a painting and thus removed from her world because they represent twisted alternate versions of this girl one is innocent and young but male the other female but worldwise and both are perversely naked pagan gods.However my real interpretation is this is all about the woman in red. After all she probably commissioned the portrait. The painting takes the form of an invitation to a prospective husband like many of Vermeers works. We see the womans wealth as exemplified by the rich fabrics and the blank mirror shows that she is waiting for a man to fill her life. But of course she already has a daughter so maybe shes a widow? Or perhaps a woman of ill repute  she does look disheveled and is drinking alone in the middle of the day. Or there may even be what at the time were considered darker undertones of homosexuality its like a scene at a brothel complete with a painting of the Roman god of sex as she hands money to a young woman  were she a man this would be a standard scene in Dutch genre painting.,museum,cqg773u,4,t5_2rti0

3833792,0,t3_34c7mv,Like all of Browns work this sculptures starting point as visible at the base is a copy of a traditional sculpture depicting a fanciful low subject in this case a flower fairy. However Brown here gives himself much freer rein than usual allowing his absurd squiggly brushstrokes to obliterate the original image.My feelings about Brown are generally negative. His artistic mission is to blend gaudy abstraction with tacky appropriation which was an interesting experiment but IMO his oeuvre proves its failure. I wish he would evolve his style more than simply changing his subject matter as hes gone from Science Fiction to Dali to Old Masters. My opinion here may sound stupid since Im promoting exactly the kind of conditioned expectations Brown wants to dispel but now that were a couple decades into his career I think its clear Browns ideas are outdated.Browns sculptures are seen as his weakest work but this actually interests me more than his painting.

Because... it was so popular that you couldnt really have a rational discussion about it... I think a piece like The Reason for the Neutron Bomb is much more nuanced than The Other Vietnam Memorial... The Other Vietnam Memorial risks being didactic... The Reason for the Neutron Bomb is absolutely neutral. Its taking some information and making a physical model of those numbers. And it takes absolutely no point its morally neutral.

Yoko was not from the Beatles own admission a driving factor in that breakup and that the tensions were present and building for some time before.In my opinion its a common thing for the spouses and partners of musicians and artists to be blamed for other personal difficulties in the artists life when it begins to impact their work.

6676140,0,t3_3znmmz,My understanding is that this painting is a copy of a painting by the Dutch Master Frans Van Mieris the Elder which was painted around .  Betsy Wieseman Curator of Dutch and Flemish Paintings at The National Gallery was consulted on a painting The Violin Player in the collection of Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council which was identified as a nineteenthcentury copy after Dutch master Gerrit Dous The Violinist.  She concluded that Dous painting is also a variant of an original painting by Frans van Mieris the elder executed in c. and now in a private collection.  Was wondering if anyone can shed light on this?  I have been unable to find an image of the Frans van Mieris painting even though my understanding is that it was sold through Sothebys London at some point.,museum,d09vd13,1,t5_2rti0

6935512,0,t1_d11yl35,gt I hate neon art. I posted this in the hopes of starting a conversation about it.Ill bite!TBH Im not wild on the stuff either. However I think its at least possible to appreciate the medium even without liking much within it. If for no other reason a lot of cuttingedge art made in the last  years has used neon so its hard to understand contemporary art without taking neon into account.I think the objectively best work in neon was done by Dan Flavin. His bold geometrical installations are notable in their own right as icons of the Minimalist era but by using neon he subverts one of the dominant interpretations of Minimalism. That movement is often seen as in some ways the apex of Modernism with the artwork reduced to a single monolithic standalone object. Flavins works fit this description but the light they cast suggests the work actually has no bounds.Then came the dominance of conceptual artists probably most famous neon worker among them being Bruce Nauman. What I find most interesting about his installations is the noise they make. As the lights go on and off so many of his pieces make clicks or whirs or other aggressive noises that cannot be ignored. Theyre like oblique metaphors for TV in that they contain both sound and bright lights produced by tubes as TV used to be yet they remain distinct enough from TV to not be heavyhanded critiques as opposed to a lot of video art which I often find too blunt.My personal favourite neon artist perhaps unfair to say this as shes my favourite artist in general is Tracey Emin. Her neon works are a great example of the shift in art that took place under neoexpressionism by putting words in neon she clearly draws comparison with the cold conceptualists but this clashes bizarrely with the messy handwriting of her words. I think its an honest expression of the frustrations of artists in the modern age who wish to free their inner selves but know their expression will always be mediated and edited to perfection. Also Emin has recently turned to figuration in her neon works creating pictures of animals that are simply beautiful.,museum,d12gtr0,7,t5_2rti0

10181098,0,t1_dbxwdok,Tadema was endlessly famous in his day actually just like Bouguereau et al. The issue is that all of academic painting was eclipsed by Modernism and its giants were largely forgotten. The Modernists hated Academicism and their view became dominant because their art was ascendant. With the passing of Modernism in ss Academic painting got some renewed interest.When I was studying art history I didnt have much interest in it actually. I later started to enjoy it because of the qualities many Modernist painters and critics hated about it. Not ironically but really unlike a Modernist works they more consistently deliver at any scale and in any context. They have a low sensitivity that Greenberg et al hated but which makes them robust.,museum,dby310v,7,t5_2rti0

10958492,0,t1_dea77bn,gtAt the risk of repeating myself I think youre looking at art through one set of paradigms and accepting them as truth.Im not especially interested in art Im interested in aesthetic response. With what Im discussing there is a true and a false in the same way that someone can hear a sound as loud or quiet. Its not true or false in the same way we might speak of a proposition of natural science which is a binary. Aesthetic response is true or false in a gradient it will either ring in a way we would refer to as true or it will ring in a way we would refer to as false. If you prefer it can be shallow or it can be deep. It is very easy to be misled by language in such matters as Wittgenstein put it Misunderstandings concerning the use of words caused among other things by certain analogies between the forms of expression in different regions of language. gtFrom certain perspectives it quite clearly can. If were talking about art that provides and illuminates common experience  art that has had the most influence on other art art that has the most influence on its contemporary world art that is masterfully produced etc. etc. I can easily argue that Shakespeare and Milton have more value than De Sade. The postmodern relativistic appreciation of art is not the only game in town.Some art is objectively better than others but its not quantifiable. Were not verifying the truth or falsity of a proposition when we evaluate a work of art but the capacity for depth of response embedded within the art. That can be experienced but not measured. gt Scientific endeavour certainly doesnt seem to have anything to do with that for me.Right I agree but youll note I did not write science I wrote scientism. This is a great article explaining what scientism is.gtI mean this can be summarised as bad things are bad. This is what I mean when I say De Sade is virtually valueless This is all that art is and does. It takes something that cannot be expressed in spoken language it displays it before us to be seen. There is a distinction between knowing something in the way you might know the cat is on the rug and between knowing Schindlers list is a sad film. Both statements might be true presupposing the cat is actually on the rug and that you have empathy for other human beings. But you see how each statement being either true or false rests on entirely different conditions? One is a matter of empirical observation validating or negating a proposition of the world. The other is a statement about the capacity one has for depth of response someone who does not think Schindlers list is a sad film may be said to be lacking in the capacity to respond with empathy towards his fellow human.Sade has nothing to do with the first one you are right that in this sense his work is utterly platitudinous but in the second sense it might yet show us something. You apparently do not see it I do.gtThey exist theyre old and interesting but I dont value them above the lives of the people lost to them.Neither do I. But we cant change that they exist and they were made to be by human suffering. That you admit they are interesting does denote that at least to some degree you see value in responding to them aesthetically. Id imagine you dont see much value but thats fine aesthetic value is intuitive you either feel it or you dont. You dont in this case others do the facts of how the work came to be has no necessary place in that response. It can have a role of course depending on ones disposition This conversation shows as such.gtIf the holiness is in question then the Quran is just another piece of poetry.Its a piece of poetry that rings true to me. Thats all scripture is. Its poetry that rings true and we accept it as that in our hearts if not in our heads. It was not written for our heads it was written for our hearts. I dont for instance literally believe that the devil has a physical presence in the material world. Its a metaphor. What does something that is just another poem look like? A poem that has no value which is to say no value to you which is to say it does not ring true. The Quran rings true to me so I read and feel value and I connect that value with faith and God. gtOne that Ive read and one that if critiqued purely as a poetry doesnt really hold up to much. To you. Others would disagree it has rung true to them so to speak. King kong vs. Godzilla is one of my favorite films because I saw it as a child and was mesmerized. Should the fact that its not as technically sophisticated as a film like Pulp fiction which I hate keep me from enjoying it? From responding to it aesthetically?gtPagliaShe is a complete waste of time. Come on. The basics we need when discussing these matters is authenticity and it plain as day that she is insincere.gtbefore Barthes came along there was plenty of discussion about art without that idea.Sure but Im interested in discussions of aesthetic response. The word art is pretty vague and nonspecific. Its like the word ethnic group useful for communicating but it can also get in the way.,museum,deaah1h,1,t5_2rti0

11598805,0,t1_dgan9m9,It is sure that Brancusi looked for inspiration in other cultures than his own preWW Romanian background but the source at the time was rather African masks cf Picasso. We would have to see how similar your replica and his statue are keeping in mind too that sometimes artistic spheres isolated from each other can produce objects that look familiar. What museumcollection does the original belong to?Another thing is Brancusi is a thcentury artist and his works are authentified while anonymous ancient Celtic art is much more difficult to trace back and th and thcentury historical and eclectic movements created many approximative gothic or ancient or Renaissance pieces or artefacts that were presented as neoyounameit but sometimes even as real ancient pieces which was not true  heres to you Charles Dawson! Thats also why it would be great to see the official institutions study around its original Celtic piece.But it would be a good surprise if they were indeed connected! ,museum,dgaqeit,2,t5_2rti0
