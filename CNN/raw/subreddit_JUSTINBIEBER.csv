4161631,0,t3_377o24,Thank you for posting! Im  and Im a recently returned Belieber. I was in love with him when he first did One Time which is an awesome song that I still jam to. Then I went off him for a while when he was making too much of an ass of himself. When Journals came out I became reobsessed. Its an amazing masterpiece of an album. My favorite band is Radiohead and I generally like music that would never reach the mainstream or hit the top charts but Journals is fuckin awesome. Every song is beautifully written and his vocal range is super impressive! Bad Day has made me cry several times. All my punkaltwhatever friends think Im weird for liking him but I just think they are following the other cool kids and rejecting him. So it kind of sucks that all I have in terms of a Bieber community is little girls. Theres not even a proper subreddit . Anyways. Yes he is SO talented. An amazing dancer performer singer etc. And whenever hes coming off like a dick thats full of himself I just justify it by remembering he grew up with millions of girls loving him and it would take a very tolerant person to not let that go to their head.,JUSTINBIEBER,crumway,1,t5_2r4ze
