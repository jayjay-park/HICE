97880,0,t1_cepcqqp,From a userexperience point of view waiting for a GoG download and waiting for a Steam update are two TOTALLY different experiences.With the GoG download its something youre actively making the decision to download. Youre mentally prepared for the wait. Even if youre impatient and its slow and you want it nooooowwww on a more basic level youre able to understand the wait as a direct consequence of your own choices. And its something you want. Its satisfying when it finally finishes and now you can install and play your game.With the steam update it may be much shorter than a game download in real wallclock terms but because it comes seemingly at random and takes away some of your choices no matter how trivial the emotional impact of the wait is magnified greatly. It feels longer and it gets under your skin more. Once you start steam and it starts updating theres no option to say I dont want to update right now I just want to play. I understand from a technical reason why it needs to do that but to the user it feels oppressive on a subconscious level at least. And that feeling doesnt go away the moment the update is finished. Unlike the GoG download you dont come out of that wait with something to show for it generally nobody gets excited about the latest Steam update. So it doesnt even end on a positive note the way the GoG download does.,pcgaming,cepknip,1,t5_2qhfg

143287,0,t3_1voyov,I used to read MaximumPC. They have interesting articles reviews and great guides. I like that they do a lot of revies on several items. My favorite is the antivirus one. They test and compare several poluar products and offer the best one a kickass award. Also they have a dream pc section in which they build three different machines depending on budget budget midrange and highend. Its handy so that you can keep a lookout of the best hardware at the moment. ,pcgaming,ceur1q0,1,t5_2qhfg

147302,0,t1_ceunflc,I dont mean to be a downer but I feel like people have hyped this game up so much that its never going to live up to expectations.No gameplay footage has even been shown and people are already going nuts over the game spending hundreds on ships etc.Just seems like a recipe for disaster to me.That said all their stuff that is out so far seems very cool and high quality.

152246,0,t1_cevp5fi,well i dont know about you but i always use my mouse so that my entire forearm is resting on the surface and when on a couch or recliner nothing does that better than the armrest. when using a computer you need to be able to quickly move your hands from the keyboard to the mouse so having an obstacle between the two would be counter productive.  putting the arms closer together is not necessarily desirable but it makes the whole unit more compact. go slouch down in a couch get super comfy and look where your arms are. the mouse and keyboard need to go there.,pcgaming,cevrt9a,1,t5_2qhfg

Im running games on ultra on a laptop and Its not even as heavy as people think it is.The only reason really that AMD is behind this little thing is because it ships more chips out the door AMD GPU and CPU thats moe chips moe moneh moe amd of course AMD is excited about this if it becomes popular that means xbox one PS Wii U and tango will be shipping AMD chip after AMD Chip.I dunno maybe I dont get it but i think this thing is dumb outside of like business or something for maybe Divorced parents Kids.

194798,0,t1_cf0lzoc,Ouch.  That turned out bad.  They are backer beware.  I mean they cant show you the game until they make it.  So its a difficult choice. Best they can really show early is scripted combat to show what they want gameplay to be like.  That is the run animations in the engine.  Its good to look at qualifications and vision.  People who tend to like early backing and early alpha are people who want some of their opinions to shape a game and dont feel current games are good enough.  That they are all the same game over and over.People threw money at Chris Roberts because he has a proven track record of making space sims that are fun.

208274,0,t1_cf25s1a,I think its mainly because the beta was only on a single map and playing that map in the main release really had no bugs at all. Compared to the beta though the release didnt seem to crash as much and had a better frame rate at least on mine and my friends pcs on most maps. Overall I think it is reasonably balanced in terms of infantry combat true there are  or  guns that are better than the rest but overall most of the guns are effective enough that it comes down to player accuracy and positioning. Im not really defending EA here BF was released a mess and is still in a few ways broken both in balance and game engine. However I will argue that it is still a good game and recently they have really been stepping up there bug fixes and balance patches. ,pcgaming,cf25z5t,1,t5_2qhfg

Only difference with the k version apart from the much lower price is that it cannot be OCed. If you are not planning to OC the CPU nor eventually get another  Ti for a SLI then getting a Z motherboard might not have been strictly necessary.Also not sure a  Ti was worth it considering youre going to be playing on a p screen. A R  or even a X would have cost sensibly less and still performed extremely well at that res.Finally I would have suggested getting a good and cheap studio . headset and separately a decent attachable mic. . headsets usually sound crappy compared with . headsets and most of the time make positioning harder. . is a useless gimmick. Plus my experience is that headphones more than often pair an average headset with an average or less than average mic.Beyond these youve gotten yourself a beast rig.

307225,0,t1_cefg935,Said Id use the trial and report back. So trial is over and heres my views Dont know why because its unlikely anyone will ever read this....Ive budgeted since my early s when I was unable to work for  months due to an injury and had to live off state benefits for the period. Im in the UK which has a good state support so things werent too bad but finances were horribly tight during the period. Being not long out of university my mathsspreadsheet skills were good and I used them to budget. It was a huge help because being aware of where of where all my money went and allocating money meant I never ran short. Because of this Im passionate that everyone should budget. Problem is the maths is very complex and needs a spreadsheet amp most people cant use spreadsheets well enough. I hoped this program would offer an easytouse budgeting solution.The software is very basic with regard to the cost. I was expecting it to do more. Main gripe is that it cannot handle weekly or biweekly budgeting. The official forums basically advise you to work with monthly budgeting and that attitude is terrible. I feel the developers have decided to sell it as specific budgeting system a bit like a type of diet and dont want to change things.From my experience there are several options that could be made available but which are missing. To make things simple they could be hidden in an advance options section but to have all of these potential options missing suggests its being made deliberately simple.The trail period is too short.  days is not enough. Since many expenditures happen randomly over several months you needs several months to get a hang for budgeting works and how it saves you money. The trail period should be  year. This isnt a computer game and if people keep using it theyre more than likely to be happy to pay for it. Seems there are hacks to reset the trial period but once again Im certain people would pay for this if they kept using it so there is no need for a short trial period. Final price is expensive but Id argue you save far more than that by budgeting. Still it could be cheaper though.It doesnt have an option to automatically import spending from bank accounts. Many users appear unhappy about this. I agree with the developer about this. This is about getting engaging with your spending and you cant do that if you automate things.So overall I passionately support budgeting but its a shame this software has limitations and is expensive. Since Im not ware of anything better I recommend it.,pcgaming,cfcm0z0,1,t5_2qhfg

Infact you just admitted that..gtThey were trying to tone the game down to run it on consolesAs for this part..gtor older PCsYeah no you dont tone down your game for PC. Video options exist for a reason. They allow someone with a shit PC to still play a game that has features best seen on a highend rig.The fact that Crytek has trouble figuring that part out the moronic reason why you have to tweak cvar files instead of tweaking video options ingame which are all preset for some fucking unknown reason says a lot about how much they give a shit about PC gamers.Adding some engine tweaks they were already going to add in their engine in a patch doesnt mean they care.

Even though last game went fullretard with the ending the game will still be remembered to have delivered some of the best characters and cinematic moments.The only thing Crysis is remembered for is a bunch of fanboys pissing themselves over better visuals.,pcgaming,cg0e21h,-2,t5_2qhfg

744961,0,t1_cgowbd4,Probably because EA is paranoid. Paranoid that any bit of access to the inner workings of the game will lead to some sort of exploit which could lead to piracy or cheating in online gameplay. Or lead to a vulnerability that could also exist in a console version thus leading to the same results. Its highly unlikely but if your code is poorly written or very buggy its not entirely outside the realm of possibility that it could cause trouble somewhere along the line. Remember MechAssault for the Xbox? Not a PC game but it was insanely popular and well known because it contained an exploit in the savegame system that could allow people to execute arbitrary unsigned code on the Xbox leading to softmodding. EA doesnt want any of their games to be known for that.Its also possible that EA doesnt want any disabled but not purged code to surface. Remember the whole Hot Coffee controversy? A minigame that developers removed from the primary game but still existed in the installed content. I wouldnt be too surprised if little things like that were still hidden within their games maybe not that controversial probably just little things like incomplete maps and demo content but its always possible that some of it was never meant for wide dissemination and could be embarrassing if it was made public.But a more likely reason is because they want to sell you stuff. Free community created maps would compete directly against DLC maps and when people see free versus . for something like maps or hats or anything else generally theyll go with free.,pcgaming,cgoyig5,2,t5_2qhfg

773075,0,t1_cgs3iye,Dark Millennium was a project under development by THQowned Vigil Games creators of Darksiders one and two and probably borrowing some of the tech of fellow THQ development studio Relic Entertainment creators of the Dawn of War series and Space Marine.As described in the linked article Dark Millenium was going to be a Warhammer K MMORPG in traditional MMORPG style read basicaly WoW. There would be cities questing pvp and alliances. Supposedly large scale PVP was going to be a major focus. Expectations were not very high.As described in the article the development was not the smoothest in the world even before THQs other troubles. Eventually the decision was made to scale it back to a normal RPG possibly with coop. And then THQ died and so did Dark Millenium.Eternal Crusade on the other hand is a still upcoming MMO thats distinctly less of an RPG. Specifically indications seem to be that it will be much less about faffing around with questing and hub cities and more about taking the fight to the enemy and murdering the shit out of them. The larger game flow will be more like Planetside than WoW where the PVP is the game rather than a sideshow. The gameplay itself seems to be similar to Space Marine third person over the shoulder running around choppingshooting things.The problem? Well... its being developed by one Behavior Interactive. Whats that? You dont recognize that name? Why they are the folks behind such classics as Naughty Bear Panic in Paradise and Doritos Crash Course and Kung Fu Panda Legendary Warriors Im not cherrypicking either. Out of their entire list of titles on wikipedia three are not licensed shovelware. One was the PS port of Mercenaries .

915153,0,t3_24lb58,I got one for WoW but it was disappointing. Personally I could not decide on what action to put on the harder to reach buttons. It bothered me having buttons that did nothing. I also had issues finding the right button and pushing it with alacrity. I was ultimately really frustrated and got a logitech g with a couple less buttons. I think having more than six or so buttons on a mouse beyond the standard left right and middle is counterproductive. In Warcraft I found it to be x easier to just use your keyboard.Later I came back to the Naga when my logitech broke. I cut out little bits of rubber and glued them to the middle row of buttons and this improved the mouse loads. I think it actually comes with little rubber stickers you can put on the buttons but i lost them. I was really annoyed with it overall but on WoW people tend to love it.

Uber high requirements are part Intel  part poor optimization and part overpowering FPS dips caused by DirectX.  Recommendations are for a high min FPS.

While the game is not exceptionally good looking and not terrible as everyone seems to be bitching about it does seem to load a lot of textures into VRAM so even if someones video card is capable of rendering the game with ultra textures they may experience performance issues because the game has nowhere to load them and has to wait to load them off your hard drive.,pcgaming,chsaa6y,1,t5_2qhfg

1131022,0,t1_chwu37x,None of those games change the world itself based on your actions. They merely change some dialogue in the game the most dramatic being the endgame results.I understand there are games that have stories that change based on your actions but not many have the world youre actually playing in change. Fallout  didnt change anything in the world itself once youve completed anything aside from a select few scripted events Megaton for example. Youd be freeroaming after completing all these quests and no one would react to the things you did.And that was a common complaint with it as well as several other more modern RPGs. Small things like having NPCs comment on your actions after completing a plot line was something quite common in older RPGs but seems to be less common in more modern ones.The things like the story cards at the end of any Fallout game which is quite common among RPGs were originally done out of necessity. They couldnt do more fancy things like altering the world cheaply and easily once the player did something so they made compromises and gave the illusion that the player had an effect.Its  we have vastly improved technology for speed rendering storage etc and were still given games that use these design tricks for no apparent reason. They can easily make things change on the fly. Im by no means extremely skilled in programming but I know enough to alter or insert code to mod as well as using scripting languages and tools that allow one to set up these kinds of events with a few clicks of the mouse.I grew up playing games that are far more grand in scope than most of the games coming out today though if you judge them solely by looks youd never guess that a lot of games in the late s through the s were vastly more complicated than anything make in the past  years or so save a few independent projects. I expected to see those games evolve on every scale but have really only seem them improve visually. In every other regard many genresseries have actually regressed to be less complex ie the dumbing down you often hear people talk about.Ive grown cold to expecting even the old story cards in modern games let alone more physical impacts on the world.,pcgaming,chwulj4,1,t5_2qhfg

AMD users have been fucked over SO many times in the past and I can talk to you in Skype Mumble Teamspeak Jitsi or Ventrilo in real time about it that I can link you at LEAST  articles which show how incompetent AMD has been with their GPUs especially in driver and game support that I dont know how ANY serious gamer would tolerate their bullshit. I wish nvidia had competition but theres none. Ive been seeing from AMD owners specifically completely misrepresenting GSync and ShadowPlay over the past  months and I want to talk to each and every one of them over voice chat because Ive NEVER seen them admit they were wrong except in voice. Fine you have some sort of an option to record but you made a huge blunder buying an AMD GPU. How many times does a gigantic peener have to be pushed into AMD owners bungholes before they accept how crappy AMD is? Its as if you guys LIKE to be abused. Its as if you DONT want your games to behave and run the best. Its as if you LIKE to have inferior performance in emulators such as Dolphin. No desktop recording? Look. I make heterosexual YouTube tutorials. I bought my GTX  Ti and I didnt even realize it had an h. codec on it. It was a bonus and what a fucking HUGE bonus it was because I record a lot of video. In fact if you look at my previous username useethewaterfall youll see that my last message contained a youtube link to one of the videos I made with shitty frapsand then my reddit account was deleted. It now says invalid password when I try to log in. Why? Because posting my own YouTube videos is banned from this shitty website. Dont tell me to calm down. Because of misinformation  of Americans deny evolution and  of them believe in the paranormal. Because of misinformation you cant even find me the best objectively Super Nintendo emulator for the PC in  hours of research. Go ahead. Try. In fact Ill give you  hours to find the answer. I bet you cant do it. Why? MISINFORMATION. I know I wont hear from you again with the answer. THATS why Im so fucking pissed.gtbut its still considerably better than ShadowPlay No it isnt. Make a new Skype account or give me the one you have now because I want to talk to you and prove you wrong. By the way its been confirmed that split audio is coming in a future version of ShadowPlay.

Most of the Assasin Creed games have female characters so they werent doing anything they hadnt already done before. What changed between those other games and this one? The only thing I can come up with is that a female character was not nearly as much a priority as in earlier games. So I think it is reasonable to ask why the female character wasnt a priority in this game. Its hard to accept the excuse its too much work if it was never an issue in the past.

PC gamers however tend to not do this since we are accustomed to messing with settings and trying to get it just right for each system. We PC gamers are always benchmarking or going through the settingsfiles to see if we can improve the performancelooks of each game to match our rigs which shows more when you get someone who has a high end rig and is disappointed when their game runs like ass and looks like it as well.,pcgaming,ciat9bo,2,t5_2qhfg

This is not limited to one game and one GPU. It happened on both of my older GPUs one from the  and one from the  series and I see it on my brothers PC as well who updated his Nvidia drivers recently also an older GPU  which rendered one of his games nearly unplayable cut the framerate in half.

There are multiple ways to emulate things.. emulating on identical hardware. this is pointless as you would have to buy a console and gut it to begin with.. emulating by approximation. this is the most common form of Soft emulation that creates engines that do not perform the same way as the original but close enough to be runnable. These are often basically costum built software engines that are hard to code and have to manually anticipate everything for every console game. which as you can assume is hard.. precise emolation. this is running a software that takes a console command transforms it to PC command processes it transforms it back executes it. now as you can see it takes a lot of steps and all of that requires processing power. due to consoles being completely diferent design such as PS cell processor a lot of power is needed for translation of every command of which there are thousands a second. you also have to do same with pooling memory ect. This means that power consumtion would increase tenfold if not more however the result is precise emulation of target hardware without needing to manually code it for every native software.We need a lot of work and professional coders for nd.

1712118,1,t3_2dylh4,Ill just relate an experience. First level D modeling classes are predominantly female. Second level gender bias went to about even. Third level it was smaller class sizes period and it was almost all men. Ive made a lot of female friends in those classes and I kept in touch. They changed majors back then because their families were allowing them to experiment but began to pressure them to choose a field less sexist because they were fearful of their daughters being abused or refused work. When you paint an industry as a hive of disgusting behavior as if it were a greased up garage in the sticks no responsible parent is going to want their daughter to give it a shot. Its really sad to see some of the girls I really liked to work with get pulled from the industry and put into Business majors theyre not at all content to be in. I dont see the gaming industry as sexist not with Anita Rice being responsible for huge swaths of warcraft lore. Not with Roberta Williams being the first woman in this country to make a million dollars from her work and not make a million through marriage or through inheriting it. I see assassins creed dragon age KOTOR games and many many more that are ships which are captained or navigated by extremely beneficial and positive female figures. Yet theres this bad light cast on us as if were strip clubs. Its gross and offensive to be thought of like that when were practically bending over backwards in American gaming to be unoffensive on the grounds of sexism and no we cannot help what japan does with its games. Thats a cultural problem were not a party to. Were not responsible in America for what team ninja does in japan.   ,pcgaming,cjuz3ho,-2,t5_2qhfg

1721443,0,t3_2e2rqy,Seems about right.The last time I was in a Gamestop granted this was many years ago the PC section was basically the latest WoW expansion and what ever MMO was being billed as the WoW Killer at that time. They had more space dedicated to used Gamecubes than they did PC games.I cant blame stores for not carrying PC games though it makes sense when you think about it. There really isnt a used market for PC games anymore and that is something that stores like Gamestop thrive on. Any game that uses Steamworks Origin or Uplay for example is a single sale. Youre not using that key again so you cant sell a used copy of that game like you can the console version. So shelf space goes to the more profitable products and the PC versions go more and more into digital sales. I do have to wonder how much of that remaining eight percent is made up of collectors editions. If I were to hazard a guess I would say most of them. The day of the disc has pretty much passed for PC. ,pcgaming,cjw5gwp,2,t5_2qhfg

1727240,0,t1_cjwu4ng,Indiegogo is similar in terms of the getting funds to people that need them to make something new. But its less productoriented and their fundraisers dont have to meet a certain goal to get the money thats donated. Because of this its plausible the people you donate to might be underfunded and make something not as great as a fully funded project.This also means that sometimes people start Indiegogo campaigns when they have enough resources for their project already. In good cases they put the money towards making the project better and in bad cases they take it as return on initial investment.Its not always a bad thing though. A lot of indie theatermusic goes the Indiegogo route instead of Kickstarter even if it means making less for their project.

LOL is not as deep or complex which brings the learning curve down but has a smoother more intuitive game play experience.If you want a game that is easier to pick up and have fun with right away go for LoL.

Overall the only thing I do not like about Redux is the bugs.  I had to replace the intro movie file with a empty text file to get the game to load and a few minor other issues but the biggest annoyance was the night vision.Sometimes when equipping them they dont equip instead you cant take any action other than running around and moving the mouse until you quit.  Also in any type of cutscene after you get them they equip themselves.  This is very annoying in vehicle levels and peaceful levels where you cannot turn them off until battery dies.

But I havent been able to really determine whats happened here and even if its what you say I think the wave of bilious misogyny and rage directed at her in the wake of this scandal is way out of proportion especially given that the more intellectual arguments for that side seem to hinge on this being indicative of systemic issues endemic to the entire industry rather than one woman.Would you mind linking the biased Depression Quest review you speak of as well as whatever evidence there is to support the idea she slept with the journalist before it was written?  Its been incredibly hard for me to sift through all the hyperbole to find the facts around this and on top of that I cant shake the feeling that this is all just friction caused by the formerly inclusive and somewhat marginal world of online gaming culture becoming mainstream and encountering a much broader level of social criticism and scrutiny as a result.  After all I dont think any selfaware gamer would deny that there always has been and still remains a serious problem with misogyny racism and other forms of intolerance in gaming culture seriously just think about the things you hear on a daily basis over the mic in most multiplayer PC or console games that remains far from being simply the domain of idiot  year olds who dont know any better.  It seems like many gamers refuse to accept that those sorts of people are part and parcel of the same gaming culture they identify with and react violently and often hatefully to any implication to the contrary which is an immature and counterproductive attitude.Dont take this post as dismissive though please I really would just like an unbiased and factual accounting of the timeline of events here so I can actually understand what is happening past all the rhetoric and outrage.  What my limited understanding so far affords me really isnt all that pretty and Id prefer to think there is something more substantial to this whole thing that falls in some kind of middle ground between the raging btards howling for Zoe Quinns blood and the snooty feminist warriors condemning the entire gaming community over it.,pcgaming,cklj2b2,2,t5_2qhfg

Ive seen the benchmarks and almost all mid range graphics cards that came out in the past  years can play it at Max settings even modern lowend cards like the gtx  run it easily.

The problem is the chair so that needs to be taken care of rather than try to remove the problems that arise from having a bad chair. The key is support and flexibility. The normal chairs are made for a wide spectrum but doesnt necessarily fit everyone perfectly. Hight adjustable chair and armrests are key. For the lower back you need lumbar support and a slight angle backwards is good. Your feet need to to touch the ground or a footrest dont leave them hanging. Go out and try some chairs. Dont think that because they have lots of pillows it will be nice think support instead.

A programmer named Baddit said he had physX running on AMD cards and that he was going to make drivers.  People said Nvidia would crush him.  Nvidia game him the PhysX source code.  He said that he was unable to get needed help from AMD.  AMD was the roadblock.  CUDA is open and they actively support opensource compilers like LLVM.  Nvidia funds GPUOcelot that ran CUDA on AMD GPUs.  It was PTX  gt AMD CAL.  AMD then killed CAL.  GPUOcelot is rebuilding with PTX  gt AMD Intermediate Language.  I guess we will see if AMD kills that.  AMD is the roadblock.  Nvidia suports all of the open standards and has better OpenCL support.  Nvidia supports AMP OpenMP ext..  When will AMD fully support OpenCL?  Good Guy AMD huh?  Good guy Nvidia was the first to publicly offer support this display adaptivesync AMD is pushing.

As far as I remember the only civilians you kill are by accident with White Phosphorous. The ending to Spec Ops is that during the war you have gone insane from being surrounded by the effects of war. The entire game is about how fucking shitty war is and how the military arent as heroic as they are made out to be. This just seems to be hurr columbine looked like fun. Its a game aimed at the sort of people who think going on a gruesome mass innocent killing spree would be a laugh. People made fun of me at school so everyone deserves to die!Sure other games have offered similar situations but its very rare that the entire game is built around it or that the kills are so gruesome and in detail.The closest thing to it is Postal and this makes Postal look tame.Just in case you are unaware this isnt the original trailer.

It legitimately doesnt take too much effort to get companies to pull their sponsorship from a website when their writers are proclaiming that the consumer base they sell to is over or that we needed to bring back bullying threats of physical assault on anyone in a public setting who mentions GamerGate vile human beings such as Patty Hernanderp who honestly think that nerds needed to die in high school and folks like Zoey who have a paper trail going back years demonstrating they are awful human beings.

2280045,0,t1_clsnam6,gt What makes you think you can refute what someone had to say in a half hour long video by watching only the first five minutesskipping through for five minutes.Didnt say that.gt Your only argument against TF is one that can similarly be thrown at Anita wheres her BA in PC gamingUm again that was the point. He makes the argument that Anita shouldnt talk about video games because she once said she wasnt a fan of them and then applies no standard to himself.gtI encourage you to rewatch all the videos. I really do.Id rather pick my teeth with a pizza slicer. Ive seen most of his earlier ones up until about six months ago I doubt hell make a revolutionary point that I havent heard some variation of.gt Watch Anitas Trope videos up until TF does a response then her videos again then response.I have barring the last two Women as Background Decoration ones. And its remarkable how much he cuts out. His original video of her first TvW focuses on only a couple of moments that amount to one minute maximum out of a  minute video. And Anita does make some good points especially in the later ones.Now conversely some of TFs points are valid like how Anita says that women are not a naturally weaker gender thats simply not true. Sexual dimorphism is a real thing. Doesnt further his argument much considering there are a handful of ways to refute that that phenomenon should have any effect in games media but just because I dislike the man doesnt mean hes irrevocably wrong. Some are also invalid like his saying that hospitals are objectification centres by Anitas logic because patients are merely acted on which is a very shortsighted comparison given that patients have a massive amount of input and agency in how they get treatment.Anita has many good points a few that I disagree with and another few that are invalid. Thunderft has a fair amount of good points more than a few that I disagree with and a handful that are invalid.gt Im just bugged that you gave a person only five minutes but gave the floor entirely to someone else.I didnt.

The k can still handle pretty much everything so you can wait till end of  when the Intel Skylake or AMD Zen cpus arrive. Those will be worthwhile upgrades for you. Going from a k to a   motherboard will cost too much to make it worthwhile and in a few cases its a downgrade. There are still a few games like Arma  Skyrim and SC that dont make use of the extra cores. I have an r x and Arma  struggles to get over fps with only  gpu usage.

Worst of all when I go to a radio tower and break the box up top it resets it permanently to default making me close the game to revert it.

Obviously its a GB Vram game and thats all there is to it. Its absolutely gorgeous most of the time and the massive crowds give it a really unique feel. But it costs. Dunno Crysis ran like shit for me too until I upgraded  but at least they told you that youd need a beast to make it look good. There might not be a way to optimize those crowds for low level hardware and without the crowds its just not the same game. A recall isnt going to fix that. But being able to get a refund would be really good for folks who found out that they cant make the game perform acceptably.

2457251,0,t1_cmfagb9,Ive never really found that to be an issue in the game.  And even if it did ruin the suspense its a single player game not a multiplayer shooter where a higher FoV actually gives you a competitive advantage so thats no reason to avoid having the option. and in the case of a competitive shooter everyone has the option available to them  FoV is more about adjusting the view to suit the distance that you are sitting from the screen than anything else. I find myself having to sit as far back from the screen as I can to play the game comfortably. Everything feels very zoomed in otherwise. The FoV has clearly been chosen with console gamers in mind that sit ft from their screen rather than PC gamers sitting a couple of feet away from a monitor.,pcgaming,cmff2dq,1,t5_2qhfg

2463989,0,t1_cmg8i3f,Can you be more clear? I was simply saying that console gaming was way worse than I remember it being and that the  version of Far Cry  seemed exceptionally medioce enough to make it go from one of my favorite games of all time to one I probably wouldnt even play at all had I tried it at a friends house. But also that recently Ive seen TONS of comments about how the Ubisoft ports suck and the console versions are way better and I even heard someone say directly to me that Ubisoft intentionally made the bad ports because of the elitists on PC. I dont have much experience with the new systems but from videosteams and recent experience with last gen systems Im saying that even with issues these notably subpar PC titles somehow are probably still better overall than their relatively more consistent console counterparts. For the most part thats usually expected but there are far too many people with little to no PC experience attempting to claim otherwise.,pcgaming,cmg8zxa,1,t5_2qhfg

2601046,0,t1_cmxrm4k,Inspired by your comment I tried out insurgency for the first time since I got it with the humble bundle a while back. My previous FPS experience isnt as much as some peoples  hours in CSGO maybe  in . and  in TF.here are my first impressions within the st hour of play. Quite impressive visuals on a indie game built on the Source Engine Inconsistent movement. Strafing speed does not match up with the speed while walking forward. Kinda was weird especially when you try to strafe around angles. Air strafing seems almost nonexistent and crouch spamming is possible which is bad for gameplay unless the hitboxes dont change as fast the Firstperson view shows it to be. Maps were well designed but the PostProcessing ruins the fine details. The fog is even worse than CSGO by a mile and the fog in CS is annoying as fuck. If there was a way to remove this I would be very happy. The huge gun models sights also block a lot of the screen Viewmodel FOV is incredibly low and it takes up a sizeable part of screen space. This seemed weird to me since the HUD is very minimalistic but the models take up insane amounts of room. I would much prefer smaller guns and bigger lettering for those with larger displays. Why is viewmodelfov blocked by Svcheats?  The smoke spam. Feels like home. Hip fire and recoil mechanics are very strange. Unscoped accuracy is very poor for rifles worse than an Unscoped AWP. Console commands seem to be lacking. I didnt try much out but showfps was nonexistent and netgraph covers the HUD.Overall This game is good overall and there are some rough areas. I tend to focus on negative areas so take my impression with a grain of salt. I dont know the update frequency or community interaction the devs have but the future seems bright for this game.edit I really like the flashpoints gamemode. reminds me of CP.,pcgaming,cmy3eog,1,t5_2qhfg

The one thing I noticed is that its really poor at loading assets in the background Id get little stutters as I drove around and my system monitor was showing disk activity when they happened. But they were very minor stutters though...although I am running off raid SSDs. For what its worth it ran a hell of a lot better than black flag did on the same system no problem at all getting it to run at a locked fps aside from the stutters.

2678842,0,t1_cn86t1e,Consistency is the biggest factor by a country mile. A highly variable FPS is really jarring to look at especially at the lower end. If its jumping between  and  fps then a consistent  will be better than that pretty much all the time.Console games are typically locked to  fps to maintain consistency it might be capable of a good bit more most of the time but to avoid inconsistency they just lock it down. Ive done this myself when working on mobile games to make them look a bit smoother when they were suffering with jumpy fps issues.For anyone interested in the boring side of it this is mostly due to an effect called spiral of death. Basically the work from the last frame like physics game logic and anything not graphics rendering dependant that couldnt be performed in the last tick due to time constraints needs to be carried forward to the next tick. This can occasionally cause the frame rate to drop really low for about a frame or two where it tries to catch up. The frame rate will still read over  because its an average but the viewer will have seen a very obvious stutter on screen.,pcgaming,cn88uh0,10,t5_2qhfg

It will improve and its nice that rd parties have freely been able to create their own implementations on AMD cards.As for D Id say there is slightly more support for it on the Nvidia side however surround support is vastly superior on AMD systems with their Eyefinity technology.SLI vs Crossfire is another complete toss up. They both have advantages and disadvantages in implementation and it ends up being which game uses which better type situation.Physx is the one thing that theres really no alternative for on AMD cards and if thats a significant selling point in conjunction with the other tradeoffs between the two companies in the various technologies aforementioned then its advisable to go with an Nvidia GPU.,pcgaming,cngkxr0,1,t5_2qhfg

With friendly fire on and the difficulty at nightmare watching Vivienne stun my own players repeatedly makes me shake my head. Anyway unlike Skyrim and such the gameplay draws me in enough that Im enjoying myself and going forwards towards a th game I can easily see it being the top dog in western RPGs. Skyrim has a similar issue to this game in that story was kind of left behind in favor of go kill another skeleton for  hours but unlike Skyrim the castmain story behind DAI is intriguing to fill gaps.Well see.

But you have to offset this with the time it takes to learn how to do everything again and the doubt that you might not be able to do what you want. I have both Linux and Windows computers and a couple of Macs but that is not relevant now. There are things that I should know how to do on Linux but dont because whenver I go do them like manual install of things not covered by my software manager I find myself choosing to use Windows just because I can do it in my sleep. That is worth the cost of Windows. Most people dont even think of defragging their drives because this is done automatically behind the scenes. Great I dont have to install drivers but I can also go to my local computer shop and pick up any part knowing that I will be able to run it on Windows. If it isnt autodetected by the system and its drivers downloaded and installed for me then I know that it will come with the drivers that I need. For older hardware Linux wins. For the stuff that gamers want to use Windows wins. The scalability argument works for Windows as well as Linux.

2959730,0,t1_co4iu6q,The difference is that big companies have seen that they can lower their own financial risk if they release their games in early access. Which is not what early access was meant to be.It was a way for indie devs to secure funding they would otherwise have difficulty to get and continues to be so.It started with minecraft and ended with Squaresoft starting their own kickstarters and Molyneux saying this Theres this overwhelming urge to overpromise because its such a harsh rule if youre one penny short of your target then you dont get it. And of course in this instance the behaviour is incredibly destructive which is Christ weve only got  days to go and weve got to make  for fks sake lets just say anything.So how can developers still earn trust from their crowdfunders? By being as open about the development as possible. They still cant disclose their financials because how much people earn is nobodys business and protected by privacy lawsAnd that is what Star Citizen does and thereby earns a lot of trust by their community. They also made the experience that sharing stuff too early can be harmful too. So theyre trying to find the middle ground and seem to have found one.,pcgaming,co4jabs,1,t5_2qhfg

3292301,0,t1_cp3guz2,Im not sure I follow your reasoning.How is supporting Vulkan any different than supporting OpenGL for a developer? OpenGL already is an open crossplatform capable graphics API yet the majority of developers chose DirectX especially in the past.There are reasons why developers would not want to adopt Vulkan as their API Performance reasons. How fast will the Vulkan drivers be adopted and how fast and reliable will they be? Im sure AMD will be quick to push drivers for their cards but will Intel and Nvidia follow suit as quickly? If I remember correctly Nvidia was very sloppy with supporting OpenGL in the past. Insufficient vendor support is a huge reason not to adopt new technologies. Legacy software. Developers dont always build everything from scratch. If your old software only works with DirectX you need a good incentive to rewrite all of that. Corporate deals. If Microsoft pays or owns you they decide what you do. Platform exclusivity. If you only develop for consoles theres no incentive for Vulkan. Xbox runs on DX PS runs on a modified OpenGL if I remember correctly. So for PS it may be useful. For Xbox it just doesnt matter. How good is it anyway? Right now they only thing we have is a name. Whether the API is actually any good and whether it matches or exceeds DX in capability is to be determined in the future.Oh and funny how you dismiss my valid points with none of that matters.,pcgaming,cp3jrwq,1,t5_2qhfg

Theres a million tutorials for this just google Windows on a mac.  This is probably most likely to run the most things.Free Install Ubuntu or some other linux and run Wine.  I have Ubuntu  running just fine on a Mac and the nvidia graphics seem to work.  Havent tried Wine on here since this is my work computer and my cube is close to the bosss office but I use wine at home on my desktop PC and its played most games Ive thrown at it.  No guarantees but you can check online if the game you want to play runs on Wine.    The advantage of this method is it costs nothing and if it doesnt work all you did was waste some time.Note both methods are risky if youre a noob becuase you might accidently erase your whole computer instead of partitioning it properly.  Get an experienced friend to help you out or make sure you put a copy of everything you care about on an external drive.

3453695,0,t3_2zs3jt,Any added support for steam will just come at a cost that gets passed on to the user in game pricing. If I had to pick between cheap or well supported I would pick cheap. Ive worked in tech support before and for every  or  people with a legit issue thats its on steam to fix at least  other will either be people with a problem on their end or people misusing the support system. I also get why they dont issue refunds for games and nowdays its so easy to read reviews and check to see if its total garbage before buying it yourself that if you buy a game with nothing but terrible reviews that unless you were one of the first people to get the game or preordered you arent without some of the blame.If movie theaters had a sign on the way out the door that says stop here on your way out if you didnt like the movie and want a refund do you know how many kids would be there every week? Such systems often just allow people abusing the system to defer their costs to the people that arent. The costs of giving you better support would only get compounded into your costs for games and with people abusing the system accounting for a larger portion of those costs it would not even be proportionally.As it is now prices are cheap so if you end up with a shit game along the way its offset by underpaying for all the other games that were both cheap and good. ,pcgaming,cply4ip,1,t5_2qhfg

Bungled menus unconfigurable controls and or incompatability with popular hardware random crasheslockups...issues that rarely ever get fixed crummy multiplayer support meaning bad or disfunctional online game browsers and crappy netcode....

Did you skip the part where I said I just find PoE to be way more challenging and tactical? Ive played and beat BG both solo and on a party at the highest difficulty with very few OH SHIT moments. That was personal experience. Im just having a much harder time playing PoE but maybe thats because Im new at it. Anyway you can retreat from combat on PoE! Just kite them from far away to attract their attention instead of rushing them head on. If you think things are going bad sacrifice the tank and move everyone else alive away. The enemies should reset and return to their original position.And Im not influenced by any marketing at all. My opinion comes from actually playing the game! I disagree that you can completely dump perrescon on DPS and expect no major drawbacks. If I do that on a cipher or a wiz and theres someone shooting arrows that means getting interrupted every single time. So resolve is kinda important. CON I agree not so much unless you play a barbarian. PER is also good for a rogue with fast attacks to keep interrupting casters. Anyway every stat is somehow useful even if only for the sake of dialogue choices. Tanks yeah are way easier to minmax PER and RES the most important stats.

You cant assume an open world game will be more intensive than a single player just based on map size alone.  Max Payne  uses models with greater level of detail compared to GTA IV and likely V too it also tracks bullet damage visually in a lot more detail a key feature of the game is that you can shoot a body to pieces in slow mo after killing them  bits fly off bullets pass through flesh and bounce off bone etc in gory detail and it uses a more advanced lighting model and rendering features too supporting SSAO and Tessellation features many games of that era didnt support.If anything MP serves to indicate that Rockstar are taking PC seriously now with the engine having been substantially upgraded and updated since GTA IV.  Most importantly it also shows that they are taking the time to support PC specific features such as high detail textures shaders and the aforementioned lighting and model enhancements.,pcgaming,cq3liu9,2,t5_2qhfg
3608880,0,t1_cq3mion,Seems like I wasnt clear. Heres the relevant partgtAre all the textures and models the same?gtYes there is only one version otherwise we wouldnt be able to make the game in time. We would have to take it all apart and then build it and test it on three different platforms at the same time which is impossible to do. Therefore we have one common basis and then transfer it to other platforms.One version of the game. With a texture and LOD pool that will be distributed across platforms in accordance to the hardware capabilities.Its how it works for multiplats. Even back in the PS days the medium or low or whatever they were called in any given title textures on PC were the same ones the console versions used as the one and only option. You could say they had the same textures and youd be  right for a given value of  right. All versions generally used the same base meshes too with PC sometimes having access to techniques like tessellation or having better LOD scaling.I very much doubt there isnt an ultra textures setting that goes beyond what the console versions use. Frankly it would be bizarre if there wasnt.,pcgaming,cq3mzw5,5,t5_2qhfg

3636495,0,t1_cq4kh5j,I made the switch two years ago. One of the main reasons was the freedom PC gaming allows. On most games I can change whatever I want. I went from playing ME on consoles to PC and I was able to fix that god awful FoV that gave me headaches. On CS if I feel the need I can have no crosshair at all or a million other types of crosshairs. It can be simple stuff like that or the ability to turn Bethesda RPGs from average games into great games.The other part was console games just dont appeal to me. Im not into annual  million budget games. Give me multiplayer games that are about longevity like CSmobasStarCraft and not just something to keep me busy for the next  months where ill be forced to buy your new title. Give me great singleplayer games like Pillars of Eternity Wasteland  etc. I would probably never play Cities Skylines but the fact that its there is still a huge positive for me.

The implication is that the antagonist has this increasingly difficult set of things that hes holding back the nearer you get to his lair.Sure maybe hed be surprised by your tenacity to survive his first boss but after that hed surely just go all Gary Oldman from Leon?Get me everyone!Everyone?EEEEVERYOOOONE!!!Boss fights are a gaming fossil that only exist because noone can come up with a decent alternative to reward the player for all their hard work.Perhaps Im in the minority but I groan every time theres a boss fight.  Theres so little variance in the format closed arena no way to escape predefined pattern to the bosss movements one single point of weakness etc etc that I happily switch on God mode just to get past them.So credit to these devs for allowing me to achieve the same thing without feeling guilty ,pcgaming,cqbrnqr,1,t5_2qhfg

They looked and saw how popular the modding scene was and said How can we profit from this? then tried to sell it as some big boon for the modders.Well yeah. Thats how business works.gt Sure it may take work for the developers to implement modding and workshop support into their games but its paying for itself by selling games.... and now they have more incentive to implement modding which in theory will lead to more games with mods both FREE and paid.gt Thats like saying we should pay extra for online functionality in games yes I know console users already do this. that online multiplayer that they invested in helped to sell games. Without it they wouldnt sell as many therefore the investment was worth it and already factored into the money theyve made from sales.I understand why youre making the comparison but I dont think its accurate. This helps incentivize a rd party group to come in and mod their games by allowing them to profit from their work.gt And what reason would publishers have for wanting modders to be able to charge for their mods besides getting a cut of the money themselves?

3782686,0,t3_33n9oq, The issue few seem to be bring up is the nature of the open collaborative world of modding. If you allow for profit you kill collaboration you create competition. This may increase the quality of work for mods that are oneman jobs but what if you want to include something from a fellow modder in your mod or if it requires a lot of man hours? There is a limit of how much people will pay for mods and how much a profit motive Already undermined by said limits and the cut steam and the publisher of the original game will take can potentially increase the quality.  Now two people have to share the profit from a mod or  or . The most powerful and popular tools in software have come from opensource collaboration  be in R or the web browers most people are viewing this thread on. Nobody is forcing anyone to work for free. This is the most insane nonsense from TBs video If a modder is very talented they can try to make their own game in an era where steam supports indie developers. Or they can try to found their own company or join an existing company. Modders create because they want to see something in the game for themselves they enjoy the process and want to improve their technical skills releasing the mod to the public allows for recognition Valuable for their CV and for others to maybe improve upon their work and establish connections to work on something greater together. Putting things behind paywalls will simply lead to people not use mods as much and allow companies further justification to crack down on the whole area.

You forget that many phones have haptic feedback motors for providing feedback during texting with the onscreen keyboards and those minute vibrations wouldnt be nearly enough to throw you off your game. On the other hand theyd provide just enough feedback when firing ingame to give you a bit of physical connection with your weapon and the actions onscreen. I think youre way overstating the vibration amount and also ignoring the fact that motors can be finely controlled and programmed. Besides you could use an included application like Razers Synapse to simply configure games you didnt want it in. No vibration in CSGo? Done. Vibration in Sleeping Dogs? Done.

I believe that the only issue here is the game developer not wanting to spend the time to integrate two physics options. ,pcgaming,crc0m46,0,t5_2qhfg

3999313,0,t3_3687yd,For people wondering about why the downgrade happened I believe I can explain why which can also be applied to Watch Dogs as well which shared a similar fate. In  some game demos were shown at E without prior knowledge of how the consoles were going to be spec wise. So really they were anticipating better console hardware than what actually came to fruition. When you look at these demos you have to understand in a lot of cases much of the rest of the game isnt completed or in the same state that the demo areas are they are only showing you a small sample of what the final game is intended to look like. Because of this textureslightingmodels are not completed yet anywhere else.When these devs found out what the hardware specs of these consoles were going to be they realized that they could no longer make a game of that caliber. You may ask why not create the best possible game for PC and then downgrade it for console? Well most devs have neither the time or the money to do this. If they create highend assets they still have to create a second set of lowerend assets. Just because you have really good assets doesnt mean you dont have to spend much time making it crappier. And thats what it all comes down to. In the real world there are deadlines and whether you like them or not you have to stick to them to maintain profitability. These devs only had time to create one set of assets and at this point you have to go for the lowest common denominator.,pcgaming,crc5j98,4,t5_2qhfg

4006788,0,t1_crbwr50,gtA game that has made a ton of money by selling ships to people for hundreds of dollars even thousands for some of those packages in a video game that isnt even close to being completed.The game has made money by selling packages of all different values what a ridiculously asinine comment.  The average price is  for over  people how is that a ridiculous when you consider that there are guild packages that sell for ?  That brings the average way up.  The vast majority of players have spent  on the game.  You obviously havent followed the development how does that qualify you to make an overarching statement on the game?  I find your comment absurd and incredibly ignorant.  Next time you make an off handed comment I suggest you do some research so you dont make yourself look like an ass.  If you dont know what youre talking about then dont fucking talk.Also the Witcher  had a budget of  does that seem like a ridiculous sum to you in this day and age?  No it doesnt. With private investment thats easy to achieve extremely easy in fact considering the position CD Projekt Red was in after the Witcher  being a popular and proven franchise.  Youre talking out of your ass you have no idea what youre talking about.  If consoles didnt exist more people would have PCs end of story.  Consoles dont contribute to gaming budgets they spread it around.  If there was one platform then developers would be able to focus on that alone instead of having to code a game to work on multiple platforms.

My link brought you to Resolution Fullscreen Vertical Sync. This is the first page that has charts and screenshots but I still strongly suggest starting from the first page General System Optimization.reading the entire guide really does not take that long maybe  minutes.This guide teaches you a LOT about things that you might not have known about the effects of many of the games settings. For example the game taught me the differences between Cinematic DOF and DOF cutscenes. These are two seperate settings and they do different things. The chart made me realize that Cinematic Depth of field added almost nothing to the visuals in the game but heavily taxes your computer. Without this guide it likely wouldve taken me a long time to learn that I should keep Cinematic DoF off but keep DoF Cutscenes on.I know this because of what he wrote and the chart he shared.Obviously most games might not require  minutes of research before delving into game optimization but personally I got a lot of satisfaction out of knowing exactly what is was my settings were doing.,pcgaming,crfqukv,3,t5_2qhfg

4085324,0,t3_37dwzj,The daysweekmonths in actual hours I put into Project Reality mostly in HOG servers makes me excited to see this. I loved the tactical side the teamwork so to speak of this mod.I really hate the modern games that focus around military combat. The fast twitch lone wolf quick respawn approach.When moving with a well formed squad point to point objective based approach nothing touches close to PR. The enjoyment of being last on KD but the most pivotal unit winning the map for the ENTIRE team. Being nothing but a sentry in a lone tower albeit never firing a shot but saving a squad or even a team from complete obliteration is amazing. Laying down an IED while your squad sets up a distraction and destroying a Stryker before it decimates your team.Nothing Battlefield      Call of Duty all Crysis ... can even come close to the feeling of a well oiled machine rolling across a map with strategy and tactics. You want to see a game that gets your heart truly racing while pinned down? Get into a firefight in an alley of Muttrah City or building in Fallujah West.I am amped for this.

His mouse is actually one of the best around and theres a very good reason why it doesnt have inbetween DPI steps.Adjusting your sensitivity ingame or through config files after figuring out your mouses native DPI is a much better way of doing it as you can get all your different game to have exactly the same sensitivity instead of just guessing it.Also adjusting through Windows is pointless since most games these days use RAW mouse input which completely bypasses Windows mouse speed setting.Theres more points Id like to cover sadly Im not very knowledgeable as far as the intricacies of mice sensitivities and DPI I just know these basics.,pcgaming,crmaqnz,2,t5_2qhfg

I understand that sometimes developers do very frustrating even gamebreaking things that certainly would make you want to pirate but do you ever think why??? Especially for single player games like Witcher TES Fallout like Crysis I know people had fun with Crysis Wars etc but lets face it MP in those games is shit there is even more incentive for people to pirate. No game with a huge MP base will be pirated as much because it is much harder to play. I know people are going to come back and list a whole bunch of pirated games with MP... but can we just use common sense? Everyone here gives PC Developers SOOOOO much SHIIIIIT and promotes really negative practices and then complain when that affects developers. YOU DONT have a RIGHT to try something before you buy it.

Unfortunately I still depend on Windows for some things I cant go  Linux yet.  If they pull some crap like charging yearly fees or chopping up the OS and charging for extras Im screwed.  Ill either have to give up gaming almost anything AAA or pay up.It also worries me about the Windows store.  The free upgrade is so that they can get everyone on a level platform that has their store.  How long before they try to push this on us?  If they try any walled garden type stuff where its more enticing to use their storeharder to buy games or other software outside their store it will screw over the consumer.  And everyone will freak out for a month before they all just go well I guess this is how it is now.Makes me pretty sad to see something like an OS move in that direction.  It is fundamental for the operation of your hardware no reason to make it into a service.  Selling it as a product I can live with they are a corporation and this is their product to sell but the rest of it pushes me further and further towards Linux.quick edit because I KNOW someone is going to say it.

Im only renting my place and there are no wooden beams in the wall so I made a stand out of pipes from home depot.Im using the Sony vplhwes. When projecting a black screen its very close to invisible. There is a game mode for  fps and this particular projector had the lowest latency of any I could find up to that price point. I run my gaming PC consoles and cable box through a Marantz SR and my speakers are Ascend Acoustics.My only complaint is the trouble of finding a good keyboard  mouse setup while sitting on my couch.

4198512,0,t1_cryr9r9,gtHonestly what do you think physics is?You might want to ask that question to devs and Nvidia. See how stone tiles fly off from explosion  and how smoke reacts to batarangs  compare that to reality. To me it looks like someone likes to play with sliders that enhance gravity sensitivity and density. This is not how you use engine that tries to emulate reality. This is how you abuse it. Or maybe the engine itself was never intended to provide realistic feelings in the first place ever since it was acquired by Ageia.gtYou have to remember its always a trade off between performance and accuracyIn a case of PhysX its a tradeoff between it can work on any CPU what about multicore? never heard of it and look at our great effects LOOK AT THEM there are so many of them.gtSo turn off demanding settings if you dont have the horsepower but let the people with  Titan X turn them on?So your logic is if a person with   GPUs can run GPU physics in the game fine then its a good option for physics and the game absolutely needs that instead of any other physics implementation?gta the cpus back then and the ones now available cant even be compared as Im fairly certain when nVidia acquired AGEIA most people were running things like the q and even then I would wager more used dual cores the i  had just released or was about to be released I think.What do you mean by that? CPUs still cant handle PhysX it was  fps back then its  fps now.b Seeing as they are a company and they are in business of making money I wouldnt be surprised they just didnt give a shit about cpu performance because why would they?Maybe because there are other good examples of companies that support open standards and generally not being shit about their technologies who dont do things like thatgttheir completely optional effectsI discussed that in other topics. It turns out that in most cases devs dont care or someone tells them they dont need that to implement a halfdecent looking alternative for disabled PhysX effects. Making PhysX effects not optional but the only viable way to experience any physics in their games.gtHell some companies were given the source code so they could compile it in SSE if they so desired.Unless there is a good source on that it didnt happen. Its not even about SSE vs x its more about threading model and amount of effects applied. Neither of which were taken care of by any game developer even though Nvidia said its up to developers to do that.,pcgaming,crytq8y,1,t5_2qhfg

However if theyre doing a large ship with simple geometry and filling in detail with a single texture that has the potential to look really really crappy.Not being an early adopter I cant really speak for the state of the game now.

Buy new chili pots only for ..  nope.Bad thing at least for me is the preorder perhaps it could be justified for the large combo but you can buy notyetcooked sides right now without any guarantees to deliver a product according to  features given on the menu.Ive heard about pickupdelivery integration but if that would require continuous effort  this is yet  another bad thing for BK.,pcgaming,cs6zyjq,-1,t5_2qhfg

4321287,0,t1_cscnb7u,gtmost likely over accusing AMD in a roundabout way of lying to the public in the latest video and then making factually incorrect statements about the new cards.  What was factually incorrect?  The numbered cards are all rebrands and not dropped a tier as is normal for rebrands.gt I saw two large reviewers that had covered the issue previously got in both reference cards for thermal benchmarking. Not surprisingly their tests showed that AMD fixed the thermal issues while increasing performance and decreasing power draw.  The reference cards werent throttling much.  It was the consumer cards that were.  Some used the review cards to bench against consumer cards and found rather large discrepancies.  Both were reference cards.  Some sites followed up and found the same results.  The cards were not close to hitting the advertised clocks.,pcgaming,cscqkyg,0,t5_2qhfg

We are missing out on games we might want to play at the whim of the hardware vendors.If people are willing to boycott games over things like Day  DLC and developers that wont patch bugs I doubt that wed be missing games for long. Gamers are a vocal group.gt Then whats happening at the moment with AMDs poor performance? Are AMD not focusing enough on driver tehcnology? Or are games developers ignoring AMD customers in favour of Nvidias bribes? Either way its a company cutting themselves off from money no?If there were solid evidence of collusion or nVidia interfering by forcing partners to lower performance on nonnVidia cards you dont think that there would be a class action in place? Anticompetition laws? If a developer chooses not to optimize for hardware then thats a shitty developer isnt it? Maybe nVidia bribes them and maybe not but that doesnt mean that a game shouldnt run on AMD hardware. But Ive seen firsthand the differences in openGL calls on varying hardware for video playback streamed to a texture I program for digital signage and while performance is similar across nVidia hardware all Radeon cards performed in unexpected ways to the point that optimization was going to take so long we dropped it cost was important we WANT AMD hardware altogether. I honestly just believe that AMD needs to fix their driver solution. If developers dont have to optimize manually then games will run more consistently across like hardware between vendors. ,pcgaming,csfawrd,2,t5_2qhfg

4386018,0,t1_csjtork,gt Edit I also lost  pounds in  weeks by changing my diet. I dont know what youre talking about saying you can only lose a pound a week. Ive done more than that a dozen times in my life.Thats quoting you Given that youre lbs and that the first  lbs was water weight thats being generous you claim to have lost  lbs in  weeks. Its true that you can lose  pounds of water weight for example if youre a boxer messing with your weight before a weighin but if done incorrectly you face massive organ failure. Not to mention that boxers usually dehydraterehydrate  under the supervision of a professional team and  dont do this for  weeks in a row. Since youre by no means a professional boxer prepping for a fight and claim to have lost this by changing your diet lets examine the validity of this claim.Lets be generous again and say you burn about k calories per day. Thats the caloric requirement for an active  minutes per day on average  foot male. That means you lost  lbs which translates to  calories total. Thats a caloric deficit of  calories per day meaning that you only ate lt calories per day. Thats equivalent to eating a small bag of chips a day for  straight weeks.Severe anorexics eat much more than that amount of food per day. To quotegtAverage kilocalories per eating episode differed significantly among categories of day F   . p lt .. The average for the binge and purge day was .

May it be music to your ears Another new thing I havent seen covered in here yet is that they opened a US East Washington DC server available currently on expansion beta only but will go public with expansion release. As a US East player my ping now averages at ms instead of ms through their current nonexpansion allinone America server based in Dallas TX  which is also available as a realm choice in the expansion!  All realms display and refresh their ping on the login screen too. EDIT  The sync briefly falls apart around the  minute mark however this was normal for the time of this recording  around May  Lockstep had only just been released for initial testing mere days earlier with the understanding that it still needed work.  Stage  test basically and one point on the todo regarded Flicker Strike crazy fast teleportattack skill as seen in the video also arguably the most reliant on proper sync.  Several weeks later as far as I have been able to tell in my own gameplay theyve pretty much resolved all of the issues with Lockstep.

If you could the internet would stop working and become a bureaucratic loading screen where one would have to prove every image they upload is owned by them. As much as it must be frustrating you cant do anything to stop people using your images. How they found your photo is interesting but again unhelpful. It wont change anything. My opinion is that they targeted you. When you registered on their forum you probably gave them your email. When the deleted your account they would have made a note of your email address. While its only speculation when you exposed your side of the story for the second time on steam they identified you as the guy from the forum and searched your email through google and possibly facebook. While there argument for why is weak petty and dumb its clear they are resorting to mild harassment because you are hurting their company by simply stating facts.IMO you are doing potential buyers of this product a huge favour by highlighting the companys deceptive ways.

They are both looking to be great games though will take time to complete. Though with ED going to XBOX there may be some delays and less of a PC focus as some have pointed out. In the end they will probably have their similarities but they will also cater to different crowds. SC is looking to be more like a EVE lite with economy and full on world immersions sim. ED is looking to be more of a casual fly through the deep reaches of space game.

4471528,0,t3_3ccfi1,There are two games that get mentioned most often. The first is Starcraft  which is very fastpaced microheavy and has the largest playerbase. The game is designed to be difficult to do everything at once which gives it a high skill ceiling and a frantic feel while playing. This is done by giving most unitsbuildings special abilities basing your economy on dozens of worker units that you build individually and discouraging unit build queueing by using resources when units are queued. These design decisions encourage the player to multitask. I should also mention that being a Blizzard product this is the most polished RTS on the market today.The second game that is often brought up is Supreme Commander Forged Alliance. This game is much slowerpaced and has a much larger scale. With this grander scale you will see many more units in a typical game a focus on macro as opposed to micro and a more userfriendly UI including infinite unit queues map zooming etc. With this game it is always recommended to get the Forged Alliance Forever client which is a communitybuilt version of the game that improves and updates it. The community for this game is not as large as Starcrafts but they are passionate.So what are you looking for? Fastpaced action fun unit abilities and  APM gameplay? Or a largescale robot army war on land sea and air?,pcgaming,csub5im,10,t5_2qhfg

4505422,0,t3_3csncu,Great to hear.  Hopefully everything does indeed pan out that way.  In retrospect CPRs prelaunch comments on the amount of content in TW seems to have been pretty spoton  at least it was in my experience.  They said it would take about  hours to finish everything in the game my playthrough on the hardest difficulty took me about  hours IIRC and Id say I probably got to about  of the side questsWitcher contracts and maybe a third to a half of the little question marks.  If I wanted to go through and explore all the points of interest on each map Id easily be putting  hours into the game  Im not going to do that though since now that Im done Id rather just save the stuff I missed for a later playthrough.Anyway if there really is enough content in the expansions to rival TW theyll be a sure buy for me.  As far as Im concerned the Witcher  is still a longass game.  TW was simply gargantuan and in my opinion there wont be another RPG along to eclipse that experience for years.  Im not sure what their expacs will be priced at but I for one will happily pay another  between the two of them at the very least.  Its obviously a dangerous mentality to get into but at least as far as TW specifically is concerned I have absolute faith in CPR and I will throw money at them because I think they deserve it.  Theyre making an excellent demonstration of the fact that you can make a shit ton of money by making good games and pricing them fairly. ,pcgaming,csyk4vf,56,t5_2qhfg

4650243,0,t1_ctgjzrv,Meh its story was ambitious and admirable but I think it all ultimately falls flat once you start to reflect upon the details. Significant Plot Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Your small team is a highly trained group of specialops on a recon mission in a modern conflict in Dubai. Your lead character goes totally batshit insane and talks to voices unbeknownst to you for a significant portion of the game. A minor scene is shown early on with you grabbing a radio and conversing with the enemy. This is later revealed to be an obviously broken walkie talkie and just you babbling to the voices in your head. There are other such scenes later highlighted between delusions and reality. You make many extremely questionable decisions and continuously press deeper into a conflict. The thing is it doesnt make much sense if you were to play this from the perspective of a sane person in that other team. What was their motivation? Theyre not just mindless grunts and their loyalty in following orders from a madman babbling into a broken radio goes from skeptical to outright laughable as things escalate. Wouldnt you think these guys would detain him and assume control? They were there with clear orders for recon and a mission. They have orders to report back. They werent there to be heroes such as your character they were there to do a job and I have a lot of difficulty in believing their motivations. This is all obscured because at the time youre not thinking about it but once the clearer picture begins to emerge it raise a lot of flags. I admittedly havent played this game in quite a few years so many of my memories are hazy but there were a lot of such scenes that left me skeptical. And SURE Im definitely nitpicking a detail but it was one that really stood out to me but theres other likes it. I wont even get into the nonlinear story elements and what was real or just a dead mans vision or any of that nonsense.The other thing that gets lauded is the emotional impact of particular scenes. This can work on the basic superficial level because the games narrative is carrying forward elements of classic novella and films. War is Hell. Thats totally fine. The problem is when you try and subvert that with Fight Club twists and other nonsense. Yes youre insane but you dont know that at the time. Those emotional scenes with the white phosphorous and the dark plot of the CIA operatives are totally justified within the context of the reality you perceive. War is hell and tough decisions have to be made. Thats interesting all on its own. However its utterly bullshit to equate those with a grand statement on the gamers own actions and influence over the narrative for too numerous reasons to list right here.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ill continue here with a bit of the above sans spoilers but I dont buy for a minute the generic and boring gameplay is intentional subversion. It feels like a poor excuse especially since if the gameplay was amazing it would actually hammer their point home much better. Youd should be replaying and murdering more and more people for the pure joy of the experience within that dark context. With this game youll be bored outside of cutscenes and pressing forward just to partake in discussions about the game or because youre curious over the plot itself. Its actually in sharp contrast with their overall point. The game will ask of you to reflect upon your actions not as the character but as a player and youll be left baffled going Uh... why am I playing? Well... a bunch of YouTubers and people on the internet said this was an amazing game and I just wanted to check it out. Im honestly only still here because of that and would have turned it off in  minutes had I not heard there was a great twist and story. Doesnt help their point at all. Quite boring to get through and Id honestly recommend just watching Apocalypse Now or watching someones Youtube Lets play if you really want to see the story. Fast forward through most of the shooty bits. TLDR Its highly ambitious and attempts to subvert military shooters as a whole and is to be respected on those merits but it doesnt hold up as either a game on its own messages.,pcgaming,ctgq44b,12,t5_2qhfg

4654169,0,t3_3eo393, Prey  This game went completely under the radar for like  of the PC industry and its a tragedy! I rank this game very high on my list as it introduced some new mechanics that only the more recent games are finally using. It was the first I played that used portals the way the Portal games use. It had low gravity and gravity walls you can walk upside down on. The story was fantastic. Its the only game Ive seen that has a Native American as the main character and its not just a gimmick they used the Native American culture and beliefs into the foundation of the game Spirit Walk is sweet and is needed a lot of the times. Graphics are very good for todays standards. Cant say enough good things about this game. One of my alltime favourite game. Singularity  This is another game that didnt get enough recognition. This game is a combination of Half Life  Bioshock and Timeshift. As you play through the game you will think the Story is okay but it picks up at the end and you realize its fucking awesome when the game is over. Gameplay is as good as the Metro games some really cool timebased combat mechanics. This game that will always have a special place in my gamer heart. TimeShift  This is one of the first games I played that used time as a combat mechanic. The graphics are okay and I didnt care much for the story but the gameplay is what makes it good. The level design was also really good. some nice timebased environmental puzzles. Painkiller The Original  This game is just tons of fun there is a minimal story didnt care for it at all. Just wanted to make demons explode into millions of gibs using a large arsenal of weapons. My favourite being the stake gun. Call of Juarez Series  I dont have too many good things to say about this series but it deserves a mention as the games are pretty decent. The stories in each are aboveaverage and gameplay is fun. If someone is looking for linear singleplayer storybased FPS games After youve played the top  on this list these games will quench that thirst and you will enjoy the time you spend playing them.These are most underrated games Ive ever had the pleasure to find on my own and play.Edit Its quite ironic that my favourite underrated games always ends up not getting the spotlight they deserve in threads lol.,pcgaming,cth7udh,13,t5_2qhfg

4809089,0,t1_cu0pi6f,All of the RPGs. I first got hooked on them when I picked up Divinity II randomly when I was browsing at Best Buy. Id heard good things about their first two games Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity but had never played them and I was in the mood for a new RPG. And... it reminded me a lot of what I loved in older RPGs. The entire game world is handcrafted not procedural. There are a finite number of resources in the world you can for example use all the health potions in the game if you are not careful. It doesnt hold your hand and because of the way its structured it does expect you to explore. There are opposing quests in the game that youll only discover by exploring the world and talking to many people... and interestingly many of these quests are not ones with a clearly good or evil choice more a matter of who do you want to help who do you want to screw over? The writing is great throughout a good story with lots of humor but never to the point that it gets in the way of the story or descends into pure comedy. Also about halfway through the game you gain the ability to turn into a dragon and fly around and fry your enemies with dragon fire. That part is really really fun. Anyhow Divinity II is my favorite RPG of the generation it was a part of whatever the last generation was called Divinity II first came out in .After that I went back and played Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity and... theres a reason they are both cult hits. All the great writing and attention to the game world that is present in Divinity II is also present in both of these games. Id recommend you get Divinity II before these however as its just a much more modern game.Dragon Commander I honestly havent put more than an hour or two into so I cant really provide an opinion either way.,pcgaming,cu0q4gu,2,t5_2qhfg

4811735,0,t1_cu0ynuw,I know youve gotten several answers so far but my main objections to it are twofold.  I fear it eventually will promote laziness from developers.  Take Skyrim and Bethesda for example and assume that paid mods were implemented.  What incentive exists for Bethesda to spend the money to pay designers and developers to implement more than the bare minimum of skins or other enhancements when they could let the community do it for free AND make money while doing so?  Furthermore one of the more popular mods for Skyrim fixed a lot of the bugs and issues with the game.  What incentive would Bethesda or any studio have to spend the money for their own developers to fix bugs and glitches when they could let the community doing and make money from it?.  Theres too much of a gray area legally and ethically when it comes to paid mods.  With games like Skryim there are some mods which depend on other mods in order to work.  If Mod B depends on Mod A what happens when Mod A is free and Mod B is paid?  Should the maker of Mod A get a cut of Mod Bs sales?  What happens when Mod A releases an update that breaks Mod B and Mod Bs maker doesnt want to fix it?Stuff like this is why Im opposed to paid mods.  Now I would support a donation button if implemented nonintrusively.,pcgaming,cu1253k,11,t5_2qhfg

And no Ive never played that mod or even heard of it.Of course there are PC games with a younger player base but generally at least thats my experience youll encounter more adults on PC games than on console games.Its hard to find any numbers on this but based on my own experience and some logical reasoning Id say the average age of console gamers is lower than the average age of PC gamers. Its very rare to encounter an annoying  year old on PC I cant even recall the last time I encountered one. While playing GTA and Halo  on Xbox  pretty much every game had at least one of these.Id rather play online games with adults or people behaving like adults because theyre often easier to get along with theyre more patient theyre more willing to play as a team and their voices dont make your ears bleed.,pcgaming,cu144y8,1,t5_2qhfg

While I try to stay away from overly difficult games frustration issues the Witcher series has always given me challenging gameplay experiences which is a nice change of pace without the frustration or tedium of artificial difficulty spikes see Dark Souls. TW does not deliver as well on this regard instead favoring more simplified mechanics.Regardless TW still suffers from overt consolization in the sad facsimile of an open world they promised a massive world with minimal loading screens... a promise undelivered. Not to mention the graphical downgrade but that horse has already been beaten to death so Ill say no more on that.The storylines and quests are as great as one would expect at least.

4860372,0,t3_3hc45f,DD is going to be very interesting because it will mostly allow the raw hardware to be the sole distinguishing factor between AMD and Nvidia. I believe it is known that Nvidia have lighter and more efficient drivers but raw hardware wise both are very close when factoring in their different approaches. I would naturally expect a X to match a . Its going to be more difficult for Nvidia because of consoles packing GCN and multiplats being tuned for it theyll have to teach various devs efficient techniques to reach decent performance on their hardware while I assume the transition from low level GCN on consoles to DD is going to easiermore straighforward on AMD.Definitely interesting to see how this will pan out. I have Nvidia hardware  and no intention to switch side but I expect AMD to be more competitive this will only lead to a better GPU market. Nvidia know they will no longer be able to rely on their driver supremacy and will have to take compute more seriously than in the past.

4912700,0,t3_3hxs9a,First of all a mouse does not have a steeper learning curve than a controller. In fact you will probably find it more intuitive after a while. When I first started gaming on PC the uncomfortable positioning of my hands on the keyboard is what got me and the way you had to combine only four direction keys to have the same type of movement. Most people who are saying it has a steeper learning curve are pushing some kind of agenda. Advice to lower your DPI is good. Secondly if you are good at FPS on consoles some skills will transfer over. More specifically I am talking about where your eyes focus on screen and general awareness of your positioning. I think if you find making the switch hard its because you arent coordinating your eyes with your movements effectively enough which you probably wouldnt have learned on consoles if you played mainly military FPS. The best way I found is to focus on the target while having an awareness of where the reticle is and constantly trying to move it towards the target. Arena FPSes will help with this but sadly most people will recommend CS which is excellent because most arena shooters are dead or have very small communities. And lastly you could start with singleplayer games until you figure out movement. Dont be afraid to try games that arent on consoles. I highly recommend Dota . FPS games are so simple and mindless in comparison but still fun. ,pcgaming,cuds69h,1,t5_2qhfg

Rome  is fixed at this point it had an abysmal launch so just pick a time period that interests you most and go with it. Rome  is very good if your PC is lacking in specs. Shogun  is supposed to be the easiest to pick up but Ive never played it. One piece of advice is Id wait to purchase on Steam  the entire Total War franchise will randomly go on massive discounts   discounts significant enough where its worth waiting for the sale. I think you can get the entire franchise for  during these sales. Edit  also dont binge buy any of the DLC  most of it doesnt add anything of worth. ,pcgaming,cug9kp7,3,t5_2qhfg

4936728,0,t3_3ifcqg,I think I may have the most unique setup here. We have two different subscriptions to two networks both wireless one is just a normal BT rural broadband connection and the other is a satellite connection. The BT is uncapped and costs around  a month. The satellite net costs around  a month but is capped to GB a month during the daytime PM  AM the cap is unaffected.The BT is around Mbps with a ping of under ms if no one else is using it which makes it the gaming network. The satellite network usually sits at around Mbps before AM and bumps up to Mbps post AM with a ping of ms so its relegated to downloads only.The satellite network is used exclusively for my dads work until PM every day because of the data cap he needs to send a lot of press releases. My PC is blocked from using it until AM so any time I want to download I need to stay up and enjoy that sleep loss. Since everyone is blocked from the sat net till PM the BT with its Mbps gets flooded by about six devices as a side note iPhones are ridiculous with their bandwidth use which spikes the ping from ms regularly just try playing an FPS competitively I dare you. TLDR we pay  a month for a network which becomes unplayable with more than one device connected pre PM and offers uncapped downloads from PMAM only really AM  AM. Gaming has never felt like more of a chore and also BT can sincerely go F themselves ,pcgaming,cugtbbt,1,t5_2qhfg

4943505,0,t1_cuhjiui,Depends on how you look at it. I dont think any game on GoG is exclusive however there are a TON of them that arent sold on any other online shops so youd have to find an old boxed copy... if you even can at all. Remember GoGs major point of interest is that they release updated copies of old games meant to work on modern PC platforms. That in itself also means that the original games might not even work on your OS at all lending another layer of artificial exclusivity if GoG is the only place you can get versions of those games that actually work on Windows  for example.,pcgaming,cuho2f9,3,t5_2qhfg

4963490,0,t1_cuk0avv,Watch the video. They differentiate between crowd and NPCs. They are claiming  NPCs PLUS the crowd you see in the video. The crowd congregates in areas but likely never or rarely move outside of scattering if you make a big commotion. The NPCs can all be targets in the other mode they mentioned and will likely make their own pathing choices based on different factors. Going to watch the show then maybe get a drink and then the bathroom. If they just stood still cheering like the crowd and never moved their AI would be very limited and they wouldnt be very interesting targets. If it was all the higher level NPCs wed be talking way more than  and it likely wouldnt be doable and without the generic crowd it would feel pretty empty so you can see why they needed different systems for both.Also Id say because the levels seem so large they likely have some sort of culling system to simplify the NPCs movement and decision making when not in view or near the player. Most games dont render or animate things you arent looking at and most of the time the only way you can tell is by modifying the camera without the game engine knowing. So in Witcher  if you freecam NPCs behind the original camera position right before you switched could be completely broken. And in say CSGO if you play in D mode which artificially widens the FOV beyond whats expected you can see straight through tons of objects that choose not to render while not on the screen. Having the highest level of AI going for  units simultaneously would largely be pointless unless the game was suddenly a topdown shooter or RTS with a really zoomed out camera.,pcgaming,cuk6qe5,18,t5_2qhfg

Most review sites get free pre release samples. There is no option for a site to buy a pre release sample if they arent given a free one. They have to wait till after the embargo after all the initial interest is gone at which point its likely not even worth it to do the review. Especially if you have to buy the card as well. Manufacturers know how important it is for most of these sites to have their reviews up the minute embargo is lifted. They can use this to influence the review market. They can not give sites prerelease samples culling sites they think might give them a bad review and this makes other sites think twice before criticizing them. You are right we do need to move away from free samples given out by manufacturers. But you will never get all sites to agree to this and those that dont agree will just benefit more. It also doesnt excuse what AMD is doing. They are gaming the system and people are defending it. Its dishonest and Anticonsumer which is what we all constantly criticize Nvidia about. AMD does it nah guys its fine!What we really nee to get rid of is the AMD are the good guys complex. They are both big corporations whose main goal is to get your money.

Youll only run into performance problems with a competent PC if you really push the higher res rendering in certain DSGCWii games and gameplay ones with Wii titles specifically meant for complex motion controls such as Skyward Sword. You CAN make a standard controller work for Skyward Sword but its ludicrously complicated and youre better off buying a real wiimote lightbar and a bluetooth dongleadapter if your PC doesnt already have one.PPSSPP is probably the most impressive Ive seen UI wise as it runs like a console OS and lets you configure everything with the controller or mousekb.

My belief is that open worldsandbox games are the only thing that AAA games do well anymore.  Thats not to say that there arent exceptions every now and then but I much prefer having a surplus of open world games as opposed to a surplus of FPS titles which felt like the case  years ago.Despite that I am a bit worn out with the genre right now.

So far in  I have played and beaten AC Unity GTA Episodes from LC LEGO City Undercover Batman Arkham City GTA and Mad Max just last week.

Theres a lot of misconception around and seems I got the worst sources when I went to check.I do wonder how invasive Oculus Home may be tho so far it sounds is not optional and thats slightly worrying.OpenVR doesnt seem to play well with Rift so them sticking to their own API makes perfect sense even tho I read some developers have found ways make it work well.In the end while exclusive games is a shitty thing to do on PC Steams massive predominance is doing the same with games being solely on their platform and doing things like the Steam controller drivers requiring you to run games through Steam to have any semblance of GUI for it.The lack of any OS support outside Win and above seems like the biggest drawback of the Oculus but that doesnt affect everyone. I do wonder tho other VR headsets are adoptingadapting to OpenVR or OSVR and they are both cooperating with each other.I think the first year of sales and the first year of games developed with VR in mind will tell how support will be and how easy is for developers to support multiple devices if it ends up being developing for all devices  Rift it may come down to just pick the one that has more widespread support.That said tho hardware exclusive games are shitty no matter how you look at it and it makes me see them in a lesser light than before.,pcgaming,cwa8ka5,1,t5_2qhfg

5550158,0,t1_cwin7mq,I would encourage you to give Hots Hero League a shot prior to making too serious a judgement it is a much better experience and I believe quick match is more of a practice mode than what should be the default game mode people play. The winning team in Quick Match is often decided by a team comp you have no control over Blizzard is adjusting matchmaking based on player feedback but its still pretty shoddy when it comes to balanced comps mmr is also all over the place. QM is where you go to level and experiment with new heros finish daily quests and grind out enough gold and xp to get into Hero League.In Hero League there is a draft pick mode currently no bans but it is likely just a matter of time before bans are added same with trading heros with your teammates. Bans and Trade are both used in professional play they just havent been added to the game yet and Blizzard has only hinted at it bringing those features in afaikHL games are generally much better as a result of the team comps. Being able to build a team comp while knowing what map you are playing makes the game a lot more fun and makes your choices on heros and talents much more rewarding. The quick match experience is a bit of a letdown to me simply adding blind pick so you have a chance to build a team comp would go a long way to help but I believe this is blizzards effort at pushing more people into ranked. So I would say  hours is enough to get the feel for how the gameplay works what the maps are like and so on but the competitive and rewarding aspect of the game is mostly realized in the other game formats which you likely were not able to participate in after only playing  hours.As for the other points  Team XP this game is less about individual play and more about teamwork team xp rewards the ability to play as a team people who are looking to be a hard carry will first need to learn teamwork. Team XP plays a huge role in the flow of the game and making the right plays to get or stay ahead is the primary means to control a game. No Items Simplifies the user experience by giving you  talents to choose from every  or so levels without the requirement to go back and use a store. This makes balancing the heros much simpler and still provides significant variation in player builds just not as significant as other games. I would argue that in most other games people are using only slight variations on cookie cutter builds or best builds in most games of loldota and so on whereas in Hots the talents change how your abilities work and can drastically affect how you play with your team. Its more than just providing stat bonuses it changes the playstyle of the hero by changing how their kit works. Also shopping takes time this is a faster paced game and being able to select talents out in the field helps keep it that way. Satisfaction in player kills You dont get a bunch of gold to go buy items with but you get xp for the team. From that standpoint I agree that it is less rewarding for a single player to get a single kill but the benefits to the team and the match can be just as significant. Again this is something core to the design in Hots and focuses around team play rather than individual play. Team fighting strategy not as deep as other mobas Generally I will agree with this hots definitely has its nuanced game mechanics in team fighting to work with at higher levels of play but it is not as difficult and rewarding to master as some of its competitors. Hots is more like an arcade style moba in that it is faster paced and less complicated.tldr Quick match is fun for messing around and completing quests Hero League is a much better experience hots is more about teamwork than individual skill. Many of the design decisions seem based around having a faster paced game which is a variation on the format that I believe is well executed enough to warrant fans of the genre to give it a serious look. ,pcgaming,cwl1rak,1,t5_2qhfg

It doesnt make sense to waste one of the three available responses assuming B is always just the get me out of this conversation button with a skill check that not all players will be able to pass so unless they have some kind of deal where holding a modifier keytrigger swaps in a different set of responses I feel like theyll just eliminate the skill checks more or less entirely.  If thats the case thats pretty damn lame.  I guess lowIntelligence characters will no longer have different dialogue options.

But you dont have to like the same games I do if you dont like it you dont have to buy it.For what its worth Id set fairly low expectations for graphics. They look really good for a Bethesda game but most of the objects in the world are their own model with their own textures so their style of game tends to use up its GPU and VRAM budgets very quickly because of the sheer number of things that have to be rendered. It wont be as pretty as a more linear game that can render most things as either parts of textures or parts of a larger model in lower detail. Since so many things can be moved they have to account for that. Im shocked by how good the .png images I saw were theyre WAY above what my expectations ever were for this game.

However Bethesda is so notorious for releasing super glitchy games and then taking so long to fix them that eventually modder do it for them. Knowing that I dont want to play this on day one.

Now there are settings that are right for everyone! When Pascal comes out it may be able to run this game in max with fps in k but new games will come out and give better max settings for the people who want more graphics on their p monitors or even p monitors.What Im trying to say is max doesnt mean shit. Neither does high medium or low but at least those are more relative to a baseline expected system.If you got a k monitor youll probably need to run games at lower settings.

5598032,0,t3_3rs4u9,I think the biggest problem is that developers dont build it themselves and they dont build it from the start. They outsource it to some third party once the game is near complete and then expect them to somehow make a good port. As an example HUD scaling isnt really needed on consoles they have like  resolutions they play at. PC has a bunch of resolutions. If the development team goes well we dont need hud scaling so lets not design for it and just hardcode everything to be a fixed size. Then when they give it to the PC developers they are gonna have figure out some way to fix the mess. If it was designed from the start and implemented with HUD scaling it wouldnt be that difficult but once everything is complete. Having to rework something thats already been completed and used everywhere is not fun. A crude example but stuff like that can be applied elsewhere. Resolution is a common issue with console ports though. There are some good ports though like GTA which i believe they said they had planned for a PC release from the start and the PC developers were inhouse and not a third party.,pcgaming,cwqzmi1,1,t5_2qhfg

5608395,0,t1_cws3wdp,Those benches dont show games under VRAM pressure. PCIE speed doesnt make a big difference because theres not that much coming across the bus. And if an engine with real time streaming has a stutter when an asset isnt in memory and has to hit the disk its broken. The whole point of streaming is that it doesnt stutter it just renders the low quality placeholder and blends in the high quality one when its ready. The issue here is games designed for a console with tons of VRAM and all too often a dev just dumps it on PC without properly designing it for PC architecture. Because consoles have so much VRAM theyve actually starting pulling out real time texture streaming from engines because they dont need it anymore on console. Call of duty ghosts was a good example of this  on PC with a GB card it looked like garbage because you had to reduce texture quality significantly vs the consoles to prevent stutters. Older CODs didnt have that issue because they were primarily built for last gen and had proper streaming. ,pcgaming,cws9xrv,1,t5_2qhfg

5626466,0,t1_cwued57,I dont like crossfire very much. I think its good for Battlefield  but it takes effort to get it running well for lots of games if at all.  GTA V runs better without it.

5627241,0,t1_cwuhdvh,check out Scott Manley on youtube for some excellent easy to understand guides tutorials and builds for KSP. He is like the KSP guru and taught most of us a lot about the game and rocket science in general. the reason you would not fall down to a planet if you stepped out of a spaceship is that you would still have the same speed as the space ship. you would just stay in orbit alongside the ship. you are basically hauling ass around the planet so fast that gravity can only keep you in orbit. in order to fall down to the planet you would have to reduce your speed. for example by firing a rocket in the opposite direction you are traveling. ,pcgaming,cwum2pu,1,t5_2qhfg

5630185,0,t1_cwuryom,The way consoles are going to win the market isnt by it being a naturally better environment. Its from developers releasing FULLY broken games to PC and spending all their time making it work on console. Hackers frame drops crashes its not the PCs fault its not the benefit of the consoles its crap developer teams being controlled by publisher and investers to only work for the minimal amount of time to port to PC. Why does MGS not let you use mouse in the menus? Why does BLOP crash computers and GPUs why does Arkamknight run like ass still these are all MODERN RECENT and huge budget games. And yet they all run crap on PC purely because the developers obviously dont give a shit about PC People cry that games like Star Citizen omg theyre a scam theyre taking so much money yet its a direct result of people throwing hundreds of dollars at a time to these crap AAA developers that release aids in the form of ports. People are sick of investing money and then being shat on with  support meanwhilst being banned for trying to fix it themselves just like this case now. So fucking stupid. A PS and XBOX ARE LITERALLY SHITTY LIL PCS yet obviously theyre getting a hell of alot more support. People get mad about piracy but yet its fine for companies to just take your money for something that doesnt even work as promised?

I gave the edge to the PC though for mouse precision I alternate between Battlefield  on PS and PC and find PC the usually far more enjoyable of the two due to being able to use a mouse.,pcgaming,cwvk7ki,2,t5_2qhfg
5635039,0,t1_cwvk6e6,Oh dont worry about player count unless they completely ruin it definitely dont preorder it regardless of platform there will be a pretty strong playerbase I assure you. With BF Hardline it was essentially a slightly tweaked but lesser version of BF so almost everyone went back to  or never even bought Hardline after trying the Beta. And DICE went back to BF as well even releasing big changes recently. Battlefront on the other hand not only has a gigantic IP to draw in players its not really the same as Battlefield and is more of a side thing that a replacement game that they wanted Hardline to be.Id say the console version will have more players and a higher percentage of bad players because of all those buying in purely for the Starwars IP. PC shooters  are in a whole other tier of speed and difficulty but even with a tiny bit of practice your mouse play should be better than your controller play. So maybe on console youre an  player and on PC youre say  the scales are different and your PC self should wipe the floor with your controller self even though you might have been higher ranked there. Because of the fluidity and responsiveness I feel that even if its challenging youll have a better time because you feel more in control of all your actions where console play is pretty sloppy and you can often feel slighted by the limits of the controls.,pcgaming,cwvkwcv,3,t5_2qhfg

5654104,0,t1_cwxxvj8,Some post process effects are a good thing. Antialiasing for example is a form of post processing. Screen space reflections is another which adds a lot to a scene visually for very little performance impact. Ambient occlusion something pretty much necessary for dynamic lighting to look halfway decent. Subsurface scattering an amazingly useful effect for vegetation that doesnt look like plastic.Post processing isnt necessarily a bad thing but the better the effect looks the harder it is on the hardware. We should be fighting against things like chromatic aberration and heavy blurring of a scene and instead try to get more of the effects listed above that really add to a game visually.,pcgaming,cwxy3gf,6,t5_2qhfg

Yes its funny to see but at the same time......really? You couldnt fix something like that? I wasnt even doing anything different or weird. I was sneaking around and I see off in a distance a raider just floating in mid air. Also the AI is really really really really fucking stupid. I can be crouched in broad daylight  and apparently they cant see me. Theyre suspicious of something take about two steps look into the sky and conclude that their minds are playing tricks on them......again really?All in all theres a lot of small things thats wrong with the game from a technical stand point. There are some design choices that I question but overall I like the game. But it sure as hell isnt a . or even a . Id put it solidly at an . Its a fun fun game and I definitely recommend that others play it if this is your type of thing.

When someone posted this information on the official forums a CDPR employeecommunity managerhonestlydontrememberexactlywhomybad responded by implying that those codes were gray marketpotentially illegal even though they werent and played the victim by further implying that they didnt see any revenue from whatever sales GMG made which again was untrue.Later GMG responded by explaining the situation that they werent able to reach an agreement with CDPR and had instead bought from other  still approved  vendors to make sure their customers could still get it there which some people apparently thought made CDPR look bad. Ever since then it became a hesaidshesaid of stupid PR bullshit but in the end didnt do anything but make BOTH companies look stupid for a bit.Thing is The Witcher  was pretty awesome and CDPR has far more fanssupporters than any one retailer is going to have so most people only remember the first part of the story and didnt bother listening to the rest.Regardless of why they might have been banned from rGameDeals or whatever else might be going on with Battlefield right now I honestly dont know Battlefield doesnt interest me and I barely pay attention to that subreddit there has never been any evidence beyond a guy I knew told me it happened to him that any GMG game has had their codes be pulled or go inactive without fixing the situation somehow at least when its under their control.

5700534,0,t1_cx3p3na,Yeah the sizeweight of CRTs was a definite downside  although keep in mind were talking fabrication and construction tech from decades ago.  Who knows what miniaturization or other advancements they could have done with the last  years of RampD.There was a semirecent technology that made some noise that was similar to CRTs but competed briefly with LCDs.  However it offered lower profit margins so was summarily dumped by display manufacturers during the concept  prototype phase.As far as eyestrain and flicker goes that was primarily an issue with older CRTs at lower refresh rates.  Refresh rates and resolution go up over time with consumer demand I consider that a nonfactor when considering what CRTs could be in .  Eyestrain could still be a concern but I strongly suspect that more modern screen films or other developments would have covered that easily.  Shrug.  The main question as to the theoretical viability of  CRTs would be the size and weight IMO since those were an actual issue that would be harder to resolve.,pcgaming,cx3pg2b,2,t5_2qhfg

5735541,0,t1_cx56v73,gt For sniping range and perhit damage are key. I actually modded the laser rifle that Paladin Danse gives you to be a sniper weapon. You need to be able to see and land hits on targets at frankly ludicrous distances and kill with a single headshot. That being said a regular sniper rifle with a . caliber barrel swap is supposed to be very good. I just like my laser sniper rifle.The laser sniper has higher base damage but a . caliber sniper rifle has the advantage of being the only weapon using its ammo type other than the inferior bolt action pipe guns where you can change their receiver to . caliber as well but theyre worse than a . caliber hunting rifle in all regards unlike the laser sniper which has to share fusion cells with all laser weapons and you can suppress it which is massive.Suppressed guns basically lose none of the potency of unsuppressed they have next to no recoil you dont get spotted and best of all it synergizes with Mister Sandman and Ninja to stack your sneak attack multiplier. Right now mine is .x versus the default .x. Hence my laser sniper does more base damage like  with full upgrades and  Rifleman points but the . caliber does more damage on a sneak attack only has like  less base damage but it gets a .x bonus instead of .x. I do a good  damage on a sneak attack and since my . caliber is a legendary that does double damage against enemies with full health it does about  damage. Compare with a laser sniper doing less than  on a sneak attack.,pcgaming,cx81tfm,1,t5_2qhfg
5736840,0,t3_3to8ch,The simple ruleofthumb is pretty much this any game where you need some control over speed or degree of turning rate for example games of stealth that require you to creep along slowly or racing games where you absolutely need degree of steering control are much better played with any analogue controller gamepad joystick wheel etc but games more reliant on speedy accurate aiming such as FPS titles will be much better with a mousekeyboard.  Fallout games require more aim than speed control so keyboardmouse are better choices but as Fallout isnt really a fastpaced FPS a controller is doable too.The wired XBox  gamepad is pretty much ubiquitous and backwards compatible with thousands of games and is worth having in your collection regardless.  The new Steam controller is wireless but takes a bit more getting used to wireless is only an essential if youre not playing at your PC but streaming instead.  The Steam controller should be almost as backwards compatible as the XBox gamepad but its still a bit too new to say right now and its twice the price of an XBox pad.  As youve found more specialist controllers such as wheels HOTAS and flight yokes can be much more pricey from    and unless you really enjoy a particular genre of games such as racingdriving they arent all that essential.  If you DO enjoy driving games a good wheel with clutchgears IS worth saving for but yeah costly.,pcgaming,cx87m2p,2,t5_2qhfg

Right now Im waiting for early access for it. Arma  is in my opinion the absolute best large scale FPS. Its on a massive scale. BF has nothing on Arma Armas maps are hundreds of kilometers sometimes. For example taken directly from the sitegt ALTISClockingin at  km Altis truly is the star of Arma . From expansive cities to rolling hills from wind farms to solar farms whether steamrolling your tank across the southern plains or waging asymmetric warfare from the northern hills the Altis landscape lends itself to some of the most detailed locales and varied engagements.Then weve got Stratisgt STRATISWith rugged terrain expansive forests and a manmade airbase Stratis offers a wealth of opportunities with which to wage war. Take to the skies in an attack helicopter or fight on foot across this  km nearfuture battlefield. The choice is yours.In BF you can travel by foot across the entire map in a few minutes. In Arma  you might actually spend a few hours just running.Arma  has a much larger and more in depth system. There are a ton of support vehicles everything from resupply to artillery to transport which all can be used by players and are often deployed during large scale PVP or PVE missions. Arma  also has AI that you can COOP or solo fight Then we move on and we have a somewhat lacking navy but wait mods! Then the airforce which is better off than the navy but some feel its lacking again mods! Infantry vehicles range from pickup trucks to MRAPs to APCs. Then theres tanks and artillery. And again mods add whatever you want from Halo the video game to modern day vehicles where you can have ten different humvee variants. RHSInfantry loadouts are much more varied as are roles in Arma . There are hundreds of guns and I keep saying mods but they add literally anything. Its quite amazing what theyve done.Arma s graphics are IMO amazing. The first game I played on my gaming PC that I built was Arma  and I was blown away. Honestly I still am every single time. Its simply amazing. Performance is sacrificed in multiplayer at times so if you are unable to accept anything beneath fps you might not enjoy it. Thats one of Armas few flaws the other being it has a few bugs and glitches.TLDR Arma is fucking massive.Also you should keep your eye on Squad. Theyre planning on making an amazing large scale tactical realistic FPS. It looks amazing from what Ive seen so far and I cant wait. I believe they have plans for  players on a server  v  maybe even more.

Even the Xbox  have pretty decent support for tessellation due to the AMD hardware in it. The PS running Nvidia hardware could run it but will run it like shit.

This update poses to strike a verysignificant blow against the trading community in addition to punishing users who even if they decide to use the app are hinderedsimply because another user not having the app forces them to sit through a delay they have no control over to get their items. ,pcgaming,cxd0fxv,9,t5_2qhfg

Everyone praises Obsidian as gods of writing but they apparently dont count Lonesome Road.All RPGs carry the basic assumption that your character is at least marginally interestedinvested in the main plot. Bethesda games actually are a bit more open about this as it is  plausible to ignore the main plot as you go fuck around for  hours. Compare to New Vegas where roughly everyone has opinions on the current politics of the Mojave and if you want to avoid the main plot youre going to have a very rough time. Note that this isnt necessarily a bad thing.

5779901,0,t1_cxcfzhi,gt Doesnt that prove my point with a full release version it becomes less of an enthusiast product and more a consumer oriented product.My point regarding this statement was that CSGO is merely a new iteration of Counterstrike a game whose community had already been built up and matured over more than a decade. In other words they wouldnt have brought in many new users to Steam since the target audience was mostly older CS folks who likely already had CS. andor CSS and hence access to Steam.gt While they arent really easy games to master it pretty easy to get into. Most casualmainstream gamers at my school own and play cs dota on the other hand while less popular than lol the most played game on pc is cashing in the popularity of the genre. Also the fact that lol is the most popular game on pc shows what mainstreamcasual pc gamers want. My use of casual here wasnt referring to the people that occasionally play candycrush on their phone but to the people that play some cod and lol.It comes down to a few things. DotA and CS have historically had some pretty poor reputations in terms of welcoming newbies. While I dont find this to be any truer than various games of the same genre its a mentality that many still maintain to this day swayed by what other people say. A lot of gamers are impatient and so hopping into CSGO or Dota  for the first time will no doubt frustrate a lot of players especially since you can potentially die with  shot in CSGO and be CCed out the ass in Dota  by even bots.I cant at all agree with Dota  cashing in on the popularity of the genre. For one DotA had already amassed a following in the millions even as a custom map on Warcraft . Dota  was already being drafted by  with talks between Valve and the developer Icefrog before LoL was even in beta. The genre wasnt even extant at the time and LoL didnt really become a thing until the end of  when Dota  was already in late alphaearly beta. Regardless of LoL Dota  wouldve managed to find its own audience in the millions due to its original fans. It could even be theorised that it lost out on some fans due to not being released sooner.gt While valve probably still cares about thier game income it isnt the main focus of the publisher. They arent really working on more games they havent released a game for a while now. Instead they are working on ways to increase income form the store platform the community market paid mods increasing the amount of preorders by offering free hats. Valve probably could have made more from dota if they used the lol business model but choose not too in the hopes that would attract more users.Well of course Valve understands that Steam is their primary source of revenues but the microtransactions from from top  generators isnt a small sum either. Im not so sure that Dota  wouldve made more money using LoLs business model. The funny thing is that Dota  actually generates more revenue per capita than LoL in spite of not having an equivalent of unlocking rune pages and champs via .The problem with this assessment is that it ignores the fact that many Dota  players played the original where all heroes were available freely. Locking them behind a paywall couldve been a very bad move. I mean just look at HoN which is considered Dota .. It locked its heroes behind a paywall and at the start most of the heroes were merely replicas of DotA ones. See how that turned out.gt They made tf fp in the same period. I think you could count that as rereleasing the game. But with the exception of portalIm assuming I didnt play it because I dont like puzzle platformers all the games valve made while theyre sequels dont require any previous knowledge. You can buy csgo and start of fresh you can download dota without having any background wc and you can play tf without having played arena shooterstf.They transitioned TF into a fp game as their own trialling of the fp price model. After a short period they noticed it was highly successful and thus applied it to Dota  which already had a good reason to go fp given that all heroes were free in WC DotAAllstars and if they didnt then the fans wouldve become spiteful of their developer Icefrog. Its not about requiring previous knowledge its about the community they already created surrounding the first iterations. Sure you can go ahead and buystart playing Portal  LD TF and CSGO without having played the originals but its far more likely that the majority or at least a large minority of its players were already fans who played the original. The same could be said for Dota  and WC DotA.,pcgaming,cxdjup0,1,t5_2qhfg

5793918,0,t1_cxexx8x,So I watched TBs video and Ive played beta and probably ish hours into the game now. Probably a bit more? Heres what Ive found Ive come to decide... The shooting mechanics arent as bad as he claims they are. They are by NO means perfect and could use optimizing but they arent so bad that I find it unfair. The pick up cards have always been a point of contention even back in beta. But I definitely die more from blaster fire then orbital strikes or proximity mines. In fact Ive gotten out of more orbital strikes than been killed by them. Hes over playing the time you have to get out of one. If your dead small in the middle youre screwed. But as soon as it pops up on the map if youre somewhere on the outside not near the center you can make it out. Individual skill absolutely plays a role in winning or losing. This is the part that I probably disagree with the most. Ive played all maps all game modes and on both sides. At rank  I have all weapons unlocked saved for Hans Blaster and this is what I can tell you about player skill. The maps were one or two people are clearly killing it and leading there team that team usually wins. There individual contributions are what allowed the others to capture the pod take the Intel or activate an up link. Its a collective thing. A bunch of small personal successes means the team wins. Ive jet packed onto an escape pod and killed two enemy players and died but my contribution to that was so my team moved in picked off one straggler and claimed the pod back. Rinse and repeat scenarios like that all over the place. Then Ive played maps where a few players that are leading both teams and thats when things become very intense. The only time things arent fun at all is when youre just on a bad team where no one is contributing to the objective or are just really bad while the other team stomps you. But thats a frustration experienced by players of any FPS. All in all. I agree the hit box mechanics could be polished up as well as having the in game pick up be more smart meaning optimized for certain maps. But most everything else he critiqued I just disagree with based on my own perceptions of playing the game at a somewhat respectable length of time. Apologies for typos.

Sorry to break it to you but it isnt going to get any better. This happens in real life when things get too big it is very hard to optimize. I love how people just say a game is unoptimized. If it is a huge world with tons of destruction that will be very taxing. The reason that consoles sell more games is highlighted in your comment. All you care about is how well the game runs not the game itself. From what I can tell people who play on console just want to play the game where as it doesnt seem like you play games for the game.

5848436,0,t1_cxm6flr,Yeah you and the top comment are probably correct theyre just full of shit. Im not so sure its good PR though not really since theyre not doing a great job of giving the public what it really wants. If anything they are very very slowly alienating their loyal fanbase with their vampirism while making it seem like theyre really swell dudes. Theyll pay for it in the end with layoffs most like.I do worry that the injection of the fresh fantasyWarhammer blood will actually increase sales so in a year theyll be looking at their numbers and highfiving themselves instead of reconsidering their position. I almost find myself wishing for a colossal fuckup like Arkham Knight so someone somewhere can maybe learn a lesson. Yet on a personal level I also want to play the damn stupid game.To your last statement though I wouldnt get too caught up in these gaming politics to the extreme. Gaming is better than it ever has been before. The sheer amount of choice content and experience we have out there is truly incredible. And OS problems aside its not like the older games are gone.

That the entire last act was missing that there are huge gigantic plot elements are just dropped cut from the game that the entire final boss encounter had been cut. Its a glaringly unfinished game. You reach a certain point in the game and it just starts recycling previous missions and then rather abruptly without context you get the ending mission.

If youre a console developer youd want to target either  FPS or  FPS which means keeping the game locked to that framerate even if only a few sections will have it sink that low.With variable vsync the game could still target  FPS minimum but comfortably output in the  FPS range the majority of the time.A prime example is Xenoblade Chronicles X which just came out on WiiU a few days ago.  The game virtually never dips below  FPS despite wildly varying amounts of geometry on the screen which means itd probably able to run well above  FPS . of the time.,pcgaming,cxtkf6n,1,t5_2qhfg

5905645,0,t3_3w2odh,Heres how I feel about this game and the critical reception towards it. Everyone saw the word DICE and thought Hey Battlefield is pretty awesome... Battlefield sounds like Battlefront... what if they were combined?! And upon the thought of that everyone collectively had an orgasm. Everyone saw the word Battlefront and thought OMG I loved Star Wars Battlefront  that was one of my favorite games ever. This is going to be a Battlefront  the sequel Ive been waiting for my entire life along with HalfLife  Psychonauts  KOTOR  and a good Final Fantasy game.All us gamers thought this was going to be a beautiful immersive somewhat competitive in the veins of Battlefield a game designed in the vein of Star Wars Battlefront  and Battlefield.EA marketed the game as a casual experience. They called it Battlefront because thats an established IP thus we gamers are far more tuned into the title than if it were some other shitty name. They got DICE to develop it because DICE now has like three studios and EA wants there to be a different DICEFPS every year but knows theyll shit the bed if a numbered Battlefield game comes out yearly. DICE is really the only studio at hand that would be any good at developing this title who else at EA makes shooter games that isnt already busy with some other title?EA designed and marketed this game exactly as what we got. They didnt market it as being the Star Wars alternative to Battlefield they never marketed it as a hardcore experience. They marketed as a casual game designed to be authentically Star Wars in its visuals and soundscape. They aimed it as younger kids who cant get enough Star Wars whos parents might not want them to play a video game where youre shooting humans and blood by the bucket pours out my best friend growing up wasnt allowed to have toy swords or guns but lightsabers were okay. They never said it was going to be brimming with content they never said it was going to have Galactic Conquest.We as gamers made assumptions about what the game was going to be like based off our past experiences. And yeah its kind of dickish that we didnt get Star Wars Battlefront  but then again no one making the game said it was going to be SWBF. We even got a demo of the game you literally got to play the game before it launched and see people playing the game before it launched.Honestly I think everyone angry with SWBF was expecting something other than what they were playing in the demomarketing materials. If you bought this game you really only have yourself to blame because they were completely transparent about everything. If you didnt see what you were getting into its probably because you were distracted by Battlefront and DICE. I hope one day the game we all wanted is indeed developed but Im not angry because this game wasnt designed for me so how could I be angry? Its pretty childish getting angry that a particular product wasnt tailored for you. If you walk into a toystore and get angry that the new Star Wars toys arent as fun to play with as the ones you had as a kid well those toys werent ever designed to be enjoyed by you. Now if you walked into to a game marketed as the sequel to SWBF youve been waiting for the brilliant and expensive DICE made sequel thats everything your little mind could have hoped for and then you launch the game and find that its everything but then you have a very legitimate reason to be angry. But as it stands you walked into the Origin Store with everything you knew about the game and walked out disappointed by the game you knew you were getting.,pcgaming,cxtri18,6,t5_2qhfg

Also I cannot help but feel that youre the guy who never liked Bethesda games to begin with which begs the questionwhy do you speak of degradation of quality if youd rate Elder Scrolls the same as Fallout ?And I am not overlooking anything. To my knowledge Bethesda have never claimed to be making a game focusing on the main quest or the characters. Its not something they claim to do. Half Life  didnt call itself anything other then a linear FPS yet it had large environments and a big story regardless. But its still a linear FPS so judging it by non linear standards would be stupid.

Instead youll have two supports or two snipers. Lame.That... doesnt really make much sense. From what I understand people who play locally are an exact clone of the original player in terms of what he has unlocked and researched. That doesnt bar a player from not being able to play a role that they want. If player one has the REP unlocked player  could be be using satchel charges while player  uses the REP to be a healer. The game doesnt force you two to use the same load out. Yeah it sucks that player ones research is the only research that sticks and yeah you do have to do a bit of hunting for stratagems to get the load out that everyone else wants but saying that the game doesnt allow you to make a diverse team with different abilitiesroles is flat out wrong. Its just far more annoying and resource stretching to do so which I agree is a problem on the games end.,pcgaming,cy3dkb1,3,t5_2qhfg

With reselling on consoles Publishers adopted Day one DLC microtransactions and selling  a game on disc and the rest via DLC CoD and Battlefield series Im looking at you to recoup the losses from reselling.   Download codes were the least aggressive strategy they employed to combat reselling.   Because of the utter bullshit publishers use to combat it reselling on PC is a terrible idea sadly.   It will just drive them make games far more expensive and pull even more games from online services to help offset resale losses.

6102266,0,t1_cyiwfir,The retailer and the manufacturer have one job To make products that people like so that they will buy more of them.Returns policies are sales tools just like a warranty is. Having a fair returns policy which to my mind includes being able to return the item within a reasonable time for no reason at all is only in place so that people will feel safer buying the product and thus make them more likely to buy.For example If I had to buy a piece of computer equipment right now and NewEgg and TigerDirect both had it for the same price then I would absolutely buy from NewEgg since TigerDirect doesnt allow refunds anymore. Even if it cost more I would probably buy it from NewEgg. The price proposition would have to be extreme for me to ever consider purchasing anything from TigerDirect because theyve decided to get rid of one the most important sales tools a company can have.Now if we were talking about a service or about something that cant be reboxed and sold again then the return policy will be different but in most cases fair. For instance I do a lot of custom oneoff work right now so Im always upfront that once the customer has signed off on a design then its locked in and there are no refunds. Im happy to make changes after the fact if it turns out the customer doesnt like the end result but Im super insistent before we finalize anything that they understand theyre going to be on the hook financially for those changes.,pcgaming,cyj9kid,1,t5_2qhfg

6146433,0,t3_3zppoo,I have trouble believing this. I upgraded to  GB RAM  years ago and I noticed a difference BACK THEN. Battlefield  and Planetside  ran much more smoothly.I have trouble also believing some of the results here. I know ghosts runs like crap on less than  GB RAM so why would AW run well? If I noticed differences going from  in BF...why would BF remain unchanged? And I know some people are noticing performance improvements in Black Ops . Heck jermgaming tried the potato masher on black ops  with  GB ram and it was a stuttery mess. it was playable on  GB though. I mean you could probably argue that the difference between  and  is minimal nowadays since few games actually push  i heard black ops  uses more if you have it and in my experience the only game to really push my  GB was planetside  using over  GB a few times. But I was under the impression that these  GB RAM requirements are serious business most of the time. Not always I know sometimes people get away with using  the potato masher videos demonstrate this but seriously. Based on my own ram usage and how my system performed at  GB I cant imagine taking out half my ram. ,pcgaming,cyoa9km,2,t5_2qhfg

6149902,0,t1_cyol0co,I doubt theyll undercut them but I imagine they could make it seem much better value for money. Oculus has picked the sort of price Id anticipated Vive showing up for and they dont include proper controllers. Theyve bumped up significantly from their development kit price and I think many people will be quite shocked by the price and hold off whereas theyd probably jumped on a device kit type price. Even if HTC pick the exact same price in April it will seem better value especially if it includes a proper controller simply because people will have accepted VR is expensive. ,pcgaming,cyooh2q,4,t5_2qhfg

However it would be financially smarter to make renting a game less appealing due to the price staying the same after the rent period. So maybe during the rent period have it full price  rent cost then after have it full price again.

6175554,0,t3_404ylt,Dying Light can last a long time theres a free update coming up that adds  levels of grind and a paid expansion pack. Excuse me its a FREE expansion pack if you already paid for it. It starts off difficult but after a bit youll start getting weapons that do tons of damage so even the spooky volatile zombies are not a threat. Well would not be a threat if they did not infinitely spawn on top of you. Theres also an exploding zombie enemy that will instantly kill you and you cant do a thing about it. Its like the suicider in Fallout  except really fucking annoying because the exploding zombies stand behind doors and theres literally nothing you can do to dodge the blast.Theres Diablo  an isometric ARPG. Its a grinders paradise and Blizzard was so incompetent it took them  years to make  hours of gameplay. After a few more years they finally fixed the game so you can just kill monsters nonstop for hours on end. Every few decades they add  more minutes of content that they stretch out over  hours.Marvel Heroes is the worlds most casual ARGP if you die you just go back to the last checkpoint. Its free to play and has well over  playable characters. Playing through the story missions nobody cares about gets you up to max level but theres omega points to get more powerful daily and weekly missions to run. There is also a never ending supply of random missions and a few large areas where you can just kill monsters nonstop forever.Warframe is a free to play third person coop shooter.

The reason why survival games are popular because you play in open world with perma death with no story mode. You make your own story. Here you will follow a story mode with the pvp zone. Once you max out your character finish the story and all other things then there will be no point in playing because you will be loaded. Now if they come out with some expansion maybe adding outside city dayz like expansion where its open pvp everywhere and so on then the game will last. would be stupid to expect this game to live longer than a year if it has no actual expansions,pcgaming,cz0cka8,1,t5_2qhfg

6278385,0,t3_41ixph,I recently purchased an Oculus DK and it comes with a lot of caveats so make sure to know what you are getting into BEFORE you put down any money. Read up on the software youll need your GPUs particular performance with your headset of choice and keep in mind that running out and buying a dev kit may limit the type of commercial games if at all that you can play in the future.After about a week with my DK I can see the appeal of VR and just how immersive it cam be. While I am not running the best hardware in the world in fact for what I paid you could just go out and buy an OSVR unit but here are a few of the limitations I noticed on the DK Headtracking isnt always supported from version to version of the Oculus SDK as of current. In fact some versions of the SDK . I think told me no hardware was hooked up when it was in fact correct. If your game doesnt support features like SBS side by side D or head tracking you can hack them in using things like python scripts to map mousemovements to your face and SBS with stuff like Ignition D. Even if you get a game to work with SBS and headtracking via third party means there is no guarantee it will work perfect.  Elite Dangerous runs like a dream on my rig on my DK solid FPS and fully immersive head tracking. Fallout  was a complete mess with blurry text and menus that were outside my field of visionTLDR Unless you prepares to debug the VR experience for each game individually use a suite of third party software to make your VR experience work and be prepared for your DEV hardware to NOT support commercial games dont buy a dev kit.,pcgaming,cz3a5k2,4,t5_2qhfg

Elite Dangerous with steam controller and without. Then report back. Are you getting more kills with the steam controller or regular controller because I went through a similar experience. I got use to using it a joystick not a steam controller but when I went back and played with mouse and keyboard I realized I basically wanted to like it so bad that getting use to it was an achievement that became gratifying but overall a gimmicky nonfunctional purpose.

6314811,0,t1_cz7b55x,first of all your other reply is wrong. you said the word optimizing implies they lower the quality. it doesnt because thats not what the word means. even if it was common practice to downgrade already released games to make them run better this is so rare I cant even think of an example that still wouldnt change the fact that the word implies nothing of the sort.optimizing doesnt mean lowering image quality. lowering image quality is just another thing you can do during development to make it run better. optimizing is improving the efficiency of the game and its various components in order to make it use less resources and to eliminate bottlenecks. this can be anything from correcting bugs that werent supposed to be there Planetside  is a good example of this they almost doubled performance by addressing a bug that was allowing the shaders to interact with the UI all the way to removing outdated systems and replacing them with more efficient ones I.E replacing an A.I system thats too heavy on draw calls which is what they did with Assassins Creed Unity. Optimizing also refers to programming a game to make use of available system resources. an unoptimized game will max out  cpu cores and suffer frame rate issues in larger areas etc. the first step in optimizing a game like this is to enable it to distribute its load onto more than  cores and the same goes for GPU and RAM usage if thats an issue.,pcgaming,cz7fa68,0,t5_2qhfg

Street Fighter is getting a PC release that has been solid so far based on betas and the support of SFIV. Killer Instinct will be getting a PC release of some kind. Skullgirls isnt a big name like the others but has been solid on PC. These other companies are finding PC worth it so Im not sure what the excuse would be for MK. Oh also Injustice did fine on PC as far as I know and that was a WB game from before MKX.

Ignoring the wealth of information on why its a bad CPU thats years past being common knowledge at this point as a personal experience its the worst gaming CPU Ive ever used. It produces perfectly fine average FPS as will any CPU. What it doesnt produce is low variance low ms frame times. Its absolutely jarring to play on compared to a Skylake or a Haswell refresh CPU. Boot it up in BF and FX  and i  will both produce  fps average but the i will have a ms frame time variance and the FX will have a ms frame time variance. You can feel it in your bones. Its just a caching issue because its really only a  core but it insists on trying to be a  core.  core packages with  threads each is an even worse setup than  core packages with hyperthreading. AMDs method they used for FX is like  less efficient than hyperthreading for putting  threads of work on a single core package. I also own an Ivy i a Sandy i a Haswell i and a Skylake i.

This is coming from someone who played far cry  and  and enjoyed them..

Im running xx in crossfire and even tho potentially the performance of these cards is good tend to suffer in games requiring vram.

When on the chapter replay mode  of the time the game will crash when I reach a certain point in the nd part of chapter . The game itself when working runs reasonably good even with everything at max SMAA and purehair on max I get  ish fps if I lower shadows to high and turn off purehair I can get a fairly stable fps. Thats IF the game runs properly though when it doesnt it chugs harder than Meshuggah often taking around  seconds to sort itself out as the framerate drops to  fps on the shadowplay counter.Edit uMegaSquishyMan was right it was the VRAM usage I didnt notice that at very high textures vram was getting maxed out on MSI Afterburner dropped it down to high and max usage was only . gb solving my problems.

6432576,0,t1_czjo9xd,Im not against denuvo Im against all DRM and by extension anything protecting that DRM.Its why I like GOG so much.  If devs stopped caring about antipiracy measures and put more effort into their pc ports maybe we wouldnt have issues like Arkham Knight.Not to mention the costs of implementing things like Denuvo.  With its success rate I can only imagine they charge a hefty fee to use it.  That money could be put toward game development.DRM is a pointless measure.  What I would like you to do is prove that piracy affects sales in a negative way.  You cant prove it.  So until that is proven DRM is pointless.At places like GOG I dont have to worry about ownership. I know I own the game once I buy it. I get a game installer DRMfree to do with what I want.  I can back it up and use it on any system even without the need for an unnecessary client.  And if GOG ever disappears or falls on hard times  I know the games I bought are safe with me.  If steam ever met a permanent end pretty much everything on it would cease to function including my games.  As most steam games have basic steam drm.  So Id have to go and find a crack for such titles and Id have to keep the game files directly as steam games dont download an installer to keep.DRMfree means I can claim ownership of my purchase.  I shouldnt have to suffer this drm nonsense just because a few people wanna pirate a game.  Especially when it cant be proven that piracy affects game sales in a negative way.

I played this game yesterday for the first time and was stuck for a while on a boss fight.

The way your character moves and handles obstacles are so absurd that it comes to the point where it starts to disgust you.

6474238,0,t1_czol6gc,I did not mean to imply that the mere presence of a linear plot is somehow pandering or unintellectual or inferior my apologies if I did. I love a good story! I was trying to convey what I believe the developer himself has said. He didnt want to include any modern gaming tropes that didnt directly support the specific experience he was aiming to create. I am on board with your description of Shadow of the Colossus the plot is just there as a loose framework for the game to hang its emotional storytelling on. The cool thing about art is that it is personal and people have personal reactions to it. Personally I feel an emotional bond with The Witness as I did with Shadow but it is more personal for me. In the Witness the connection feels like it is between me and the developer rather than me and the characters. Im ok with this but there is nothing wrong with only appreciating certain kinds of art. Some people are really into music and dont feel anything from paintings. For others paintings are boring and only good literature can evoke emotions.  Youre absolutely right that good stories are about emotional engagement but stories are not the only art form that can do this and stories are something that can be told in almost any medium. The sort of emotional engagement Blow aimed to create was one that embraced the medium. Whether or not he succeeded is individual to the observer i.e. what did it do for you?,pcgaming,czozden,2,t5_2qhfg

Microsoft is going to try and become a platform like Steam or Origin that really shouldnt be that shocking.  I said it is the strategy Microsoft is going to take. They are doing whatever they can to push integration between PC gaming and Xbox.  Having the game locked to their store is about the easiest way they will control that. Add the fact that the infrastructure is already there and no percentages are taken by anyone else and Microsoft has no reason not to at least try to push their storefront.

6581332,0,t1_czzs74m,Thats pretty much what the developers of Rust did and it worked out pretty well. I think there are tonnes of redundant features and ideas that the devs of DayZ would do well to get rid of. Things that come to mind the whole damage system and the temperaturedampness effects. What use do these things actually have? Theyre awesome in theory but being cold has a negligible if anything at all effect on the survival of your character there is literally no difference in utility between a badly damaged item and a pristine item and the only negative effect being wet has is that it becomes fucking irritating seeing that status message pop up every  seconds.Some of these things might have have some effect on a single digit variable in some obscure line of coding in the DayZ engine but as far as Im concerned it has no tangible effect on the way you play the game. All these features do is remind me of how shit DayZ is at the moment.Id go one step further actually and suggest that the dev team take steps towards phasing out zombies and accentuating the whole idea of surviving against nature. To do this they would obviously have to think about implementing a more robust weather effectbody heat system improve the animal count build upon the crafting system and increase the rarity of canned food and clothing.I just honestly dont see zombies ever reaching a state where Id consider them either frightening or a threat to my safety. ,pcgaming,d002amo,0,t5_2qhfg

6643993,0,t1_d06j0t6,gt That sounds a whole lot like dying light on release.Was it? I bought it on release and the only issues I had were when I set details to max but then again what should I expect from ...  Not like F crashed about  times before I even left vault  admittedly I played on W so maybe that was the source of problems first sidequest one with closing  valves underwater bugged out when mirelurks aggroed quest giver quarry itself got stuck on low detail textures and on  it dropped to FPS when I climbed skyscrapers near Goodneigbor. nd game Ive ever returned for a refund.gt Fallout  is the same exact shit as fallout  but with better gunplay and crafting. Neither game was intended to be a roleplayingheavy game.Then neither deserves to be called Fallout. You cant just for example make a MOBA FPS and call it Gothic  even if its set in Myrtana. I disagree on F though  it still had most RPG elements from the franchise.gt Fix what?FPS drops CTDs AI pathfinding quests UI that is in current form a giant pain in the arse to navigate on PC... You know the usual shit thats broken for months in Bethesda games.gt Yeah with their amazing development choices like implementing Hairworks without even bothering to lower the tessellation used on cards that dont properly support it.. Strawman argument but lets roll with it  stop using potato PCs and maybe youll see why it has advanced graphical options. Hairworks looks awesome and if you like low details play on consoles.  . Tesselation is being used in many games because it looks best for the computing power it requires.gt Or better yet turning off hairworks all together on cards that have  support for it.So let me get this straight  youre blaming CDPR for disabling technology on cards that dont support it? Are you stupid or just trolling me?gt Why not? Bethseda just bundled their new DLC in a previously existing season pass. Why cant techland bundle the new DLC in the previously existing season pass or Enchanced edition version of the game?I imagine it has to do something with business model. Techland probably havent expected DY to take off massively and they had restricted budget on game with money from additional sales going to shareholders. This way they have no extra funds for developing more DLCs than planned initially. To get funding they either have to get money themselves through season passes and prepurchases or convince sponsors to grant them money and the best way to do it is to show sales figures and prognosis.  Bethesda planned at least a handful of DLCs for F from the beginning so none of those announced ones are sudden ideas. They can afford to put more value to season pass especially as means to sweeten the deal or people that understandably dont want to buy barely working game with little to no Fallout content.,pcgaming,d06joiw,1,t5_2qhfg

Even having just one more person with you makes a tremendous difference. But once I got my hands on the legendary gun and some decent blue and purple items it felt like I was a death machine. It drained all the fun out of it. It seriously feels like the entire game will be gearbased not skill based. Even the coop became a cakewalk with good gear.

6749560,0,t3_47w2qj,No I dont think we do. I think people dont just compare apples to oranges. EA is huge and has long standing talent behind it and the studios it employs. With that we would hold their standard higher because we know what is put into it. With Indie games we dont know the developers and often they are tiny teams with almost no financial backings often done out of pocket in spare time. When that happens and a game turns out to be fun and not have insane bugs that is a good sign and they usually garner praise.Again it is really hard to compare giants to ants it is better to compare them to each other. I see Jim Sterling rip into indie devs all the time because some of those games are just garbage on any level of development. However we have seen a lot of really simple and short indie games become popular. Undertale is praised and love to no end. It is a short as hell game it is simple as can be but it is satisfying. Now you mention price too that is always a good factor. I personally would pay no more than  for SUPERHOT I agree there this is poor pricing. Likewise people scorn battlefront for being  but it provides less than people are willing to spend on it.So much of it is subjective the lines are blurred. However en masse when people point to a game and said it was good it usually is. The most fun indie games are generally solid games that are less robust. I think what makes people praise them more these days in part is that they are like AAA releases were  or even  years ago. The game is solid on release it is finished and you dont expect any DLC or microtransactions if anything you get some little free updates but even that is a long shot. It feels more honest to people and I think that gives some peace of mind. There is a lot that goes into it but again I just think it comes down to expectation versus reality. With AAA our expectations are high and the last few years especially the reality has been lots of unprofessionally released games trying to get more money often on day  of release. Indie games have generally lower standards we dont expect much but we expect it cheap. When it is a solid release and is fun and the price is right no one asks for more. The graphical fidelity is often lower and so is the amount of interaction but I believe the core game experience often makes up for that in peoples minds and they dont expect more.tldr comparing AAAples to  Indie Oranges,pcgaming,d0hgm1c,1,t5_2qhfg

I disagree with his opinions about console exclusivity  Nintendo or anyone is not forced to publish anything for a system other than their own.There is no justification of piracy BUT how a person values his own money is his own problem. Nintendo specifically has a really awful track record of . bad consoles .awful pricing Even if its wrong from an ethical stand point  I can see the reasoning behind it. I own a Wii U  but I couldnt see myself paying for a ROM of SNES at  euros. And restricted to Wii U. Ever. I dont have that luxury. And since the original dev team is getting almost nothing  I dont even want to. The only way I could possibly justify the purchase of a Wii U game is by buying a retail copy on sale. Because eShop is a joke.In other words if the publisher is a lunatic with billions in reserve  there is no impact from piracy.

Ill just leave a quote from TVTropes because it explains better than I did. gtBioshock Infinite uses this to provide a meta commentary on the nature of video game storytelling and how the player interacts with it through the theme of Constants and Variables. There is always a man a lighthouse and a city and while there are a few points in the story where you are presented with a binary choice it has no effect on the ending or the path you take through the story. Certain events are fixed such as the fact that Spoilers s  Booker never rows to the lighthouse the coin always comes up heads and he always picks ball  at the Raffle even after being explicitly told not to. On a meta level the plasmids and weapons at your disposal as well as environments that support multiple approaches mean that the number of ways a given playable encounter can pan out are effectively infinite just as the title suggests.

7059205,0,t1_d1ghttn,There was an exploit where leaving a controller attached to the computer allowed to use aim assist with a mouse because the game detected the controller as main input device but you were still able to use KBM. Naturally aim assist wasnt inteded for KBM users and the devs fixed it.After the patch the game keeps to constactly switching between devices when different inputs are detected so that when you use a mouse aim assist is disabled. Nothing has changed for controllers there is still aim assist.I personally use a controller and I think that aim assist should be nerfed a little bit because now its bad implemented but I tried KBM and they are vastly superior to controllers when it comes down to FPSs in fact I dont think aim assist its such a big issue. ,pcgaming,d1girqb,3,t5_2qhfg

Its not totally fine and normal for any women to want to feel sexy once in a while without it being a defining trait of their personality.  s Having played the game and enjoyed her character I have  trouble believing Tracer would have a little fun like this once in a while   Without her needing to be a  sexual all the time person.

7080137,0,t3_4cgkkf,The first one was a flawed game with a lot of cool ideas in place.The Nemesis System was especially surprising to me. When they announced and described it I remember dismissing it just as the old shitty level scaling with a new marketing twist on top.In the end I had to admit it was much more. Of course it has its limitations and in the long run youll start noticing some repetition but its still noteworthy. Uruks dynamic hierarchy an enormous amount of aesthetic differentiation and their ability to memorize their previous interactions with you in a simplified way of course but it works all contribute together to make mooks feel like real characters who play a part in your story. Sometimes even a memorable one.Before I familiarized with the system enough to learn how to exploit every single weakness the game even manage to give me my actual nemesis.This fucker of a hunter captain started as immune to melee attacks which were at first the only subsystem I was somewhat familiar with and opened his way into becoming a virtually unkillable beast just kicking me on my teeth every single time.He wasnt just hard to kill he also dealt a shitton of damage with his poisonous spear and he turned constantly out of nowhere even when I was facing other commanders.He became my nightmare until I had a chance to exploit his only actual weakness which was fire and explosive stuff.And of course he never stopped remembering me how many times he already kicked my ass or forced me to retreat.When I finally got how to deal with him and managed to kill the sucker I cheered then I had to stop for a moment to realize Goddammit how cool was that?.Now for the bad parts. What I liked the least about the game beside the dull plot and the longterm sense of repetition which to be fair is almost inevitable was the Assassins Creedinspired collectathon garbage.I get its optional stuff but Jesus Christ when you are designing a world and your idea to fill the map is We should totally put in dozens and dozens of shiny spots that reward you with  exp each one you need to stop and reconsider what you are doing.Heres my suggestion dear game designers the next time you feel like you need to hide treasures in the game map dont bother with hundreds. Put in tentwenty of them at most but be sure that finding them is a bit more challenginginteresting and the reward a bit more exciting alternate weapons? unique upgrades? alternate outfits maybe even with their unique bonusmalus? etc.Youll be surprised by how much more filled with cool stuff the world will actually feel even if there is factually more empty space.Anyway the TLDR version is that Im very curious to see how they will improve the formula assuming they will in a sequel.,pcgaming,d1iwcna,1,t5_2qhfg

7092073,1,t1_d1k7vau,Bloodborne is the best game of this generation so far IMO absolutely phenomenal game and lore thats insanely deep and interesting. That aside ps has uncharted and a ton of others that I wont go into a list about point is both consoles have exclusives and while Im a huge halo and gears fan I play my ps way more than I play my Xbox one nowadays PC still the most though.Edit everyone is bringing up Witcher  so I should mention that it is my second favorite to bloodborne. Witcher  is a damn good game and the best rpg of the last few years at the least. My issue with the game is that the combat is somewhat weak and while the story and many quests are really great there is a little too much repeated worthless stuff on the map. Im a completionist and I ended up getting so damn bored of the game at a point that I stopped playing it for almost a month. I picked it back up and forced myself to finish but by playing everything available to me kinda ruined the experience because it slowed the pace of the story down to a crawl. Bloodborne I beat without even knowing what the story really was but I have now beaten it  times and done tons of research into the lore and now its story blows my damn mind. The truth is most people who beat bloodborne never delve into its lore and dont gain the same level of appreciation for it that the more hardcore fans do also the combat is insanely good. I dont expect others to agree with me this is only an opinion. Witcher  is definitely the larger game and a masterpiece of its genre but I just ended up appreciating the artistry behind the bloodborne world a bit more in the end. Both are amazing games.,pcgaming,d1k975y,4,t5_2qhfg

As the game director I have final creative say over what does or does not go into the game. With this particular decision it was an easy one to makenot just for me but for the art team as well. We actually already have an alternate pose that we love and we feel speaks more to the character of Tracer. We werent entirely happy with the original pose it was always one that we wrestled with creatively. That the pose had been called into question from an appropriateness standpoint by players in our community did help influence our decisiongetting that kind of feedback is part of the reason were holding a closed beta testbut it wasnt the only factor. We made the decision to go with a different pose in part because we shared some of the same concerns but also because we wanted to create something better. We wouldnt do anything to sacrifice our creative vision for Overwatch and were not going to remove something solely because someone may take issue with it. Our goal isnt to water down or homogenize the world or the diverse cast of heroes weve built within it. We have poured so much of our heart and souls into this game that it would be a travesty for us to do so.We understand that not everyone will agree with our decision and thats okay. Thats what these kinds of public tests are for. This wasnt pandering or caving though. This was the right call from our perspective and we think the game will be just as fun the next time you play it. If it isnt feel free to continue sharing your concerns thoughts and feedback about this and other issues you may have with the game please just keep the discussion respectful.

Also repetetive enemies. Splicers and big daddies. I really couldnt enjoy it.I skipped Bioshock  for that reason. Then I bought Infinite on sale without big expectations. And it rocked. The enviroment was a huge leap from System Shock  climates which some people did not like. At first I hated the idea as well but Columbia grew on me. But most importantly  the combat. It was finally enjoyable. Mixing vigors with proper FPS gunplay really worked for me. Maybe Infinite needed more gore but overall infinite was a good FPS in my book  far better than the first one.,pcgaming,d203406,5,t5_2qhfg

Out of the box console controller recognition no maintenance or debug of thrd party drivers or applications required. Easily migratable hardware have a new rig and dont want to reinstall your whole OS just swap drives or swap internal parts and never be bothered to have to reactivate your OS license. Completely usable with ANY recognized controller not only the Steam one.There now anyone correct me if you think Im wrong but how are these not advantages over Windows for an enduser?And again is fine if you think Windows have more advantages which can be debated just like the ones I mentioned and choose it over SteamOS but those dont invalidate the ones I listed..,pcgaming,d25mgjo,4,t5_2qhfg

Now granted every game including this juggernaut is bound to come to an end sooner or later maybe.  And a gradual decline in subscriptions is going to happen at some point...Right?But that isnt whats happening here.  People still WANT to play the game that they love...  But they want it to be a game that they love and the current retail iteration is not that.In fact so many people want WoW to be a good game again that with the Warlords of Draenor release the subscription levels spiked so high that it almost returned WoW to their glory days.  They went over  million subscriptions again for the first time since Wrath of the Lich King.  And then people were so bitterly disappointed that the numbers went from that nice high point to the lowest point in the games history in a matter of months.Clearly the game is moving in the wrong direction.Blizzard has alienated over seven million fans.They definitely need to do something to get those fans back and at least a partial return to their roots is a great way to start doing that.People want it.Blizzard can either offer something to those fans or watch their cash cow die a quick death.And then everyone will be on private servers.,pcgaming,d27i7rz,1,t5_2qhfg

It is a challenging game  sure  but try to think of it as a collection of scenarios you are asked to master.  Once you master a portion of an area  and get all the goodies  you can speed past most of it to get to  what you need to do next.

There is a lot of artificial difficulty in the game and you are even encouraged to cheese certain enemies by making half of a pair reset. And instead of making journeys to bosses after a death the cheap difficulty and uninspired world connections result in most players running straight from their spawn to the boss trying to avoid all enemies and damage.The game just isnt worth playing in my opinion.,pcgaming,d2f1tg2,0,t5_2qhfg

But yeah the movement is fun as always never really had trouble navigating around in FP a lot of critics like Yahtzee said on the first game that in first person it was hard to navigate which I just dont see in catalyst.But yeah I really hope such a different game does well for EA and DICE to show that you can do other shit that isnt generic shooter  and still be successful. ,pcgaming,d2fv7l7,1,t5_2qhfg

7381392,0,t3_4gclq7,I have a large bedroom with a couch and a king bed. Kind of like a studio. So for me I have my computer and TV right next to each other. I game exclusively on the TV despite the p monitor. I bought a Steam controller and only use that now. For a while I only played games that supported the  controller now I can play anything. I find it works better emulating kbm than  controller anyhow. I used to have a . set up as well but now I just use TV speakers because my surround sound receiver blew up. The only limitation right now is voice comm. I am weighing my decisions. I have a nice set of cans  Fidelio X  but they sound like shit on my mobo sound card. I might just stick with the TV speakers and use a bluetooth headset for voice comm.Personally I wouldnt ever go back. I do IT for a living and sit at the computer all day. My last job I actually sat at the desk as little as I could I was usually proactive and moved around the office all day instead of waiting at the desk. The couch is much more comfortable than a desk at home. With the Steam controller you can also set it up to use on the desktop with some mild success. I used to use my older  TV as my only monitor. I bought the  p and a  TV and I really couldnt use the TV as a main monitor too big to sit at and do normal typing stuff. The  was fine because my desk was big and I sat back a good distance.Like I said though Steam controller makes this all possible. I would say I am maybe around  as good as KBM with it.

7390905,0,t1_d2i5l3d,People keep acting like Dark Souls requires intense player skill in order to succeed. Thats just plain wrong. It doesnt really require you to have amazing reflexes most of the time just decent ones. You dont have to memorize combos or utilize advanced strategies to win. You just need to learn enemy patterns and take advantage of their weak points. You dont have to dodge  of every boss attack to beat them. You actually get quite a bit of leeway. By the time you get to Pontiff Sulvayhn you should have like  chugs of your  Estus flask. Thats a ridiculous amount of healing in comparison to Dark Souls or Demons Souls.  You dont have to be incredibly good at video games to beat Dark Souls you just have to pay attention. And again I have to stress this if you take away the difficulty from Dark Souls youre taking away a lot of the game. The controls are rather simple as are the RPG mechanics. When you explore the game you really only get excited about finding some good armor or weapon or a new spell because they give you an edge against the horrifying world your character inhabits. If the game is a cakewalk  and make no mistake an easy mode would make it that  then there really is no fucking appeal. As for making it appeal to those who want easy mode why should they? Why should From alter the game they want to make to cater to those who arent really interested in the game as it is? Why water down a unique experience for the sake of those outside their core audience? Not every video game is for everyone nor should it be. I dont like sports games but I dont demand they add explosions and power armor to Madden so that I can enjoy it. I just play a different fucking game. ,pcgaming,d2ianiy,3,t5_2qhfg

I just didnt want to code forrun an empty server. Especially when I was doing it for free as a passionlearning project. but all that aside basically everything else was made available. I think the monetisation factor really brings out the shittiness in a lot of people and that i really worry that if valve has another shot at bringing in paid mods and I strongly suspect we havent seen the last of it the modding scene will become even worse for it.

7394597,1,t1_d2iko3n,Im with ya I love DooM I love DooM mp amp coop. People saying they dont play DooM for the mp or the coop well they are missing out and have been since the early to mid s. I dont think they could be more out of touch.      Loadouts are not DooM loadouts are Halo loadouts are Battlefield. The two weapon system comes from consoles because they had to find ways to limit how many weapons you could carry and they only had so many buttons to select said weapons. Now yes some games like DooM  did not have loadouts on the console classics like GoldenEye did not have this problem either. There were other trade offs to make that happen for years they withheld leaning in CoD games even after CoD  Modern Warfare allowed you to do it PC players were pulled down to the console level were leaning is not allowed thats going backwards. So dont act like consoles arent holding us back and encouraging this BS.      Sure you can play the original DooMs on an Xbox but the gamepad is going to slow down your reaction time and your ability to aim as accurately. They dumb our games down for the lowest common denominator and so many defend it like its just the modern way to do games. Look at Minecraft original Java version thats how you do a modern game its not about graphics its about options as many as possible. Im not going to bother with a mp that doesnt allow me to pick up a weapon off of the ground that is ridiculous.

This isnt another Star Craft like game but a different take on RTS.  If you havent notice games that are more focus around economy or business tend to not sell as well as those with combat.  I know its a no duh but this is what you get with more niche games.  gtHasnt cracked the top sellers list on steam yet hopefully it will be able to over the weekend.It likely wont.  I be surprised if it did.  gtJust because a vocal minority whine about something it doesnt mean the majority of people agree with them.It wouldnt irk me if it was truly the vocal minority.  I am saying I am seeing more games like you saying what ever the price is is too high no matter what it is.  Only exception is games gamers are so in loved with the price point is thrown out the window.  Dark Souls  is a perfect example.Visit the Steam forums and more specifically the forums on Steam for games themsevles and you see loads of posts saying game X is too expensive. ,pcgaming,d2m195h,1,t5_2qhfg

And in fact on some of the larger maps I think it could potentially go even higher.I do agree with you though that  players on some of the smaller maps and for certain game types is just ridiculous. Operation metro anyone? Thats just the stupidest clusterfuckiest map ever when playing with  players. Granted it is fun sometimes.But I think that highlights the biggest issue with BF is that it seems like there was one single focus bigger maps mostly and more players. So bigger is not always better and trying to make every map fit every game type is just... dumb. Thats what I remember liking most about BC the maps were focused.

There might be a small amount of screen tearing but less so than if youre running above your refresh rate. Frame times will be all over the place.With Vsync Your GPU will wait for the next refresh before displaying the next frame. This delay means that if the GPU takes longer than  refresh to render the next frame then it has to wait for another whole frame before displaying that frame so you get frames that last twice as long.

Theres a lot of support behind Vulkan just not from Microsoft.B Exactly.  Thats my point if you develop in UE Source  you can easily port to Linux using Vulkan API. If you develop in Visual Studio you develop with DX which doesnt support Linux.  VS does not port to Linux.C Maybe but were not talking about porting an exe were talking about developing from the start for multiple platforms.  You write one source and compile it to multiple platforms with minimal changes.  If you develop in VS and want to go to Linux you have to port and write new code with Vulkan you dont.D Xamarin does NOT port to Linux.  If it does please provide me with a source but nowhere can I find anything that says Xamarin supports Linux.E You can port Vulkan to DX you cannot port DX to Vulkan.I dont care about how UWP works what I care about is how UWP is developed.Vulkan is trying to change the game making it easier to develop for multiple platforms at one time.

Therefore a broader range of playstyles with more emphasis on dynamic hero choice and counters. You like being a healer? Well theres  healers here all a bit different instead of just . Just generally more accessible. TF is very competitive. So is Overwatch but in a different way. E.g. ultimate abilities. From other comments it seems like a lot of people dont like them because they feel theyre lowskill. But its infrequent chances to feel like a badass even if youre not especially skilled that make people feel like its a game they can enjoy. And actually high skilled players can mitigatecounteravoid ultimates relatively easily with practice. So skill is still valuable but lack of it isnt just a demoralising crushfest that puts people off the game. Some nice small but smart decisions. Like time limits that get extended so if a team is dominating the game doesnt get dragged out too long for the people getting crushed. Or game modes that are designed to evoke a sense of pace to the game e.g. attackers have it easy on point  but harder on point  so games often feel like they a have a sense of progress but also b get really tense at the end. How much of this TF already does I dont know been ages since I played it. Just the general level of polish you get with Blizzard games which I think outshines even Valves games and theyre bloody topend awesome dont get me wrong  I just think Blizzard edge them out slightly.  An intriguing backstorylore that is expressed ingame. I love TFs story elements but its mostly outofgame.Basically Blizzard have never done anything outandout new. Im not sure why anybody would expect them to at this point. Their entire MO is to take a type of game thats popular then a polish it to a shine and b make it a game ANYONE can play and enjoy and beat the people who popularised that genre at their own game.And finally even if you disagree with all of that  TF is an old game at this point. I think a lot of people are just ready for a new TF and for many I think Overwatch might be it.

7585460,0,t1_d34e1tm,Personally that doesnt kill the game for me. The lack of server browser does. But I do think its a big disadvantage.There are lots of reasons. FPS obviously is different to refresh rate. In some games going above the refresh rate of your monitor with FPS will result in hideous visuallyobvious tearing. But others like competitive FPSs are typically designed not to do this. This is partly because once you get to say twice your refresh rate you dont see anything like as much tearing even on ordinary games. Its also partly because the game itself is optimised avoiding things like significant drops. So theres no disadvantage. But you still get parts of the screen on different frames. Whats the advantage then? Well although you dont get all of the frames independently displayed you do get them displayed even if only partly. This means that you do get that extra info. Thats a very minor advantage in competitive gaming. I do recommend you try this yourself in CSGO. Thats also not accounting for the fact that stuff like vsync and FPS locks very frequently always in the case of vsync give you added input lag. Probably the most noticeable game for this Ive played is Mad Max no input lag with vsync off but so bad that cars are uncontrollable with it on.Anyway this seems like a niche thing. It is. But this is exactly the sort of thing that distinguishes a casual shooter from a competitive one. Having the sort of walledgarden lockeddown approach that typically comes with Blizzard games and R for that matter wont work for creating competitive FPSs.,pcgaming,d34fhb7,3,t5_2qhfg

People who intend to pirate a game arent costing the company anything by pirating the game and if anything might decide to buy the game because they like it so much. Very few people who initially attempted to pirate a game will go on to buy it because of some super strong DRM system. People who pirate things generally just cant afford the game. This is especially true in places where games are expensive. Canada where I live has a very high rate of piracy compared to the rest of the world and our games also happen to be  bucks a piece these days. Combined with the tax rate where I live it actually comes out to about  bucks.  CAD is about  USD but salaries dont reflect the lower value of our currency so a kid working minimum wage has to work  hours just to play the new COD game or whatever which is ridiculous. DRM also encourages piracy in some respects you have to deal with a lot of bullshit when you actually buy a game these days when a pirate can just pass right through all that always online crap and stuff.,pcgaming,d3hn7hf,1,t5_2qhfg

I was also introduced to DOOM and Wolfenstein D by my cousins around that time.My parents got our first PC maybe around a year later it was a Gateway . It came with some games including Mech Warrior.

I think that was probably the first PC game that I actually bought. Played that until I saw StacCraft Brood War at another friends house where I almost had a stroke because of how cool it looked. I just remember thinking Terran Marines were the coolest things ever. Still play StarCraft off and on casually to this day and rock a Terran Marine avatar on Steam B.net etc.Something about PC gaming just always felt more natural and convenient to me. You have everything that you need right there in the PC gaming web browsing work literally anything. You have a mouse and keyboard which help you avoid the cumbersome controllers but you also have the option to use a controller if you desire. No competition for me. Ever.,pcgaming,d3kdayu,1,t5_2qhfg

Pixars Renderman with REYES algorithm was the industry standard not pure raytracing. This started to change in recent years but Toy Story wasnt rendered with raytracing. Even Avatar wasnt rendered with raytracing only some light baking. Gravity was Arnold renderer and Avatar  will be too Wetas Manuka renderer.gt did consoles hold everyone back again?Consoles didnt hold anything back but a console with realtime hardware raytracer is . technically possible. . would be a game changer greatly impacting the industry. Its super hard to release a raytracing card that doesnt work with the entire PC library and is meant for new kind of software chickenandegg problem but its not a problem to make a new console that does things in a different way and without backwards compatibility. Mark Cerny from Sony admitted that devs specifically asked him to not design PS for raytracing. I think the only traditional console company that would be interested in this kind of disruptive change is Nintendo because it doesnt really that much on the billions spent on RampD and tools in the AAA multiplatform industry.gt what happened?AFAIK two reasons . The classic Kodak digital camera problem. Imagine that you are Nvidia and invested billions and spent so many years on perfecting rasterization. Would you want to completely drop it change the paradigm and start pushing new tech where you dont have that experience and matured hardware architectures? This is why the best electric car is made by a startup not an old industry giant.. Actual technical issues with raytracing. How do you want to impress people with physically correct but expensive raytracing when the industry pushed all these fake tricks of rasterization so far that we can fool our eyes with pseudophotorealism at much lower computational cost? On the other hand that cheating will only take as so far and side effect of that arms race with optimizing incompetent tech base for photoralism at the lowest possible cost is one of the reasons why s Crysis is still one of the most photorealistic games. Modern games have crazy amounts of realtime photoshoplike filters that try to approximate real physics like SSAO or screen space reflection. These things fall apart even on a monitor to an untrained eye. In VR they are so bad Oculus and Valve push to go back to traditional forward renderingNow something more optimistic more and more highend effects in games go away from screen space hacks and use distance fields and... raytracing like raytraced shadows. This may be an incentive for Nvida and AMD to put some dedicated hardware modules in future for a perf win. Otoy does some amazing things with Brigade engine running on traiditional GPU with CUDA. FPGA coded for raytracing can raytrace x more efficiently than a GPU. dedicated raytracing hardware ASIC can be even x more efficient than FPGA in other words it may be possible to get lets say x better efficiency in raytracing than using GPGPU like CUDA just by making transistors for this specific task. eye tracking with foveated rendering is much more raytracing friendly and can easily boost performance x while rasterization struggle to use that approach efficiently with low res overhead my even decrease the performance. there are more things that rasterization does in a way that is a technical dead end. Planar projection of a rasterizer makes rendering for nonstandard displays like VR terrible and already causes some serious inefficiencies. Nvidia came up with a workaround called Simultaneous Multi Projection but its still much much worse than using raytracing which solves this problem beautifully.  speaking of VR there is a mobile! VR headset in the works that will use hardware raytracing   ,pcgaming,d3rprkc,16,t5_2qhfg

I can only assume they believed it to be keygenned and then banned it.gtWhy didnt you send them a photograph of the physical key with some identifier so they know its you? Or a receipt? How about contacting the store you bought it from for additional support?Because I didnt contact support before buying the second game. Just didnt cross my mind. It was like . Big deal. And the first game I had bought when I was probably . I have no idea where I had bought it from. Even if I did I dont think theyd do much for a purchase made  years before.gtThen you bought another physical copy and the same thing happened? Sounds sketchy honestly I wouldnt buy from whatever store youre buying the games from ever again.Yeah I dont. I think it was from Amazon. Probably some nonofficial seller which was the problem may have been a used copy. Regardless I played online for a couple days then CD Key Disabled again. Thats when I contacted support. The second copy I bought off Amazon when I was in college. The first I bought when I was .Its been several years and it wasnt important enough to me to follow up on. Starting Brood War online in  was simply not a good idea for fun.EDIT And again Im not one to bitch about downvotes but I dont get why Im being downvoted for this. I bought a game CD Key Disabled before ever playing online. I bought the game again used I think CD Key disabled a few days after playing online. Not once did I cheat.

If the yields are very bad but are stable on the lower end parts then it would make more sense to stop chucking the silicon back through the factory and just release lower end cards while you internally work on bettering the chip yields. ,pcgaming,d48mqbw,2,t5_2qhfg

They just need to really evaluate optimisation techniques instead of fancy new lighting features like PBR and godrays.Although I do agree the core engine needs a reboot the animation engine is ass and the physics implementation is unstable.However replacing it with UE Frostbite etc isnt going to make a good RPG at least not the kind that Bethesda was known for. Those engines are not designed for player driven emergent gameplay. They each excel in various areas but are generally designed for linear narratives.

Heck Valve didnt even announce this funding thing until Oculus became controversial in this regard. lolOculus is doing a LOT to grow the VR industry inspite of timedexclusives.. Actually partially because of it! Possibly more so than Valve was doing at least up until now.They may offer additional bonuses for timedexclusivity deals but theyre not requiring developers to take that option and theyre also not asking for permanent exclusivity. What they ARE doing is helping many developers big and small who couldnt take the Risk to get into making VR games to take that risk. By doing so Oculus is making sure that VR wont fail and that there will be plenty of VR games out there.And also what do you call a heavy focus on ergonomicscomfortqualit and easy of consumerexperience and encouraging good VR experiences that dont turn people off to VR? I call that good for consumers. Oculus has put an enormous amount of effort into making their headset comfortable for consumers and a lot of research into bringing people as good a VR experience as possible quality wise.So no I simply do not agree with the unfortunately common opinion here that Oculus is being greedy and evil.. No they may be behaving a bit foolishly at times but theyre not being evil.

8008468,0,t1_d4g11ts,No need for EA to distribute their titles on other platforms if the consumers go to origin anyways to play them.Valve didnt do it differently either. From the start Steam flourished only because of exclusivity. CSS HalfLife  EP and later the Orange Box were huge accelerators for Steams growth. They could not be played without steam. Then as the years went even retail copies of games had to be activated on steam earliest I can remember was CoDMW? The  FP rerelease of TF Dota and CSGO also drove attention to steam. Right when origin launched with that bad reputation because of privacy concerns hah as if steam wasnt a concern for privacy.Also steams recent  fuckups regarding userdata leaking were abysmal. Shit hit the fan back then but the sheeple went back to feast in the sales.BTW Ubisoft does not rely on exclusivity. Every single one of their important titles is on steam with uplay added as rd party drm.,pcgaming,d4g86p1,3,t5_2qhfg

To quote one of the EADICE staff To really do justice to the French army in multiplayer and once again to show a side that was not used to see we have chosen to dedicate an entire premium extension with special treatment after the launch of the game. translated from french,pcgaming,d4kc1kx,1,t5_2qhfg

8156973,0,t1_d4wsn17,wrong. i assume youre referring to the Interrupt stat which is indeed not clearly explained. a percentage would have been more clear for people rather than a flat number.however i am referring to the counterparryriposte system which is based on timing. a properly executed block in any stance done at the correct time during an enemy attack animation results in a smooth slowmo block that leaves the enemy open to a counterattack your subsequent counterattack when also properly timed will also activate a slowmo effect and the attack is a guaranteed hit. these can be chained together up to  times with the right skill unlocks but you dont need to spend a single point to use this tactic.also the ranger stance additionally allows you to dodge backwards with the same slowmo guaranteed execution mechanic for good timing which is excellent for dealing with groups of enemies but you did not invest any points in this tree   and almost none in warrior despite relying entirely on that stance  so i guess you didnt know this either. the game has a stance switch button to do this on the fly for this reason. you didnt mention any of these mechanics in your video or in your post here. in fact you claim parries and counters dont exist. why should anyone listen to your criticism of this developers combat system if you dont understand how it works?,pcgaming,d4x648x,6,t5_2qhfg

8235855,0,t1_d56wvpb,Denuvo seems to be unintrusive for most people now which is half of what we want from a DRM. The other half is we want to be able to play our games indefinitely. When I have kids I want to be able to show them Doom as it was in my day or maybe I just want to play the game I paid  for when Im older.Unfortunately the first half is all that is noticeable to most people since they get to play the game while its popular so it doesnt matter if its playable in  years. Like its mentioned in this OP it doesnt even take  years for DRM to break games. GTA  is still considered a pretty modern game. Its been out for like  years now and broken for many people for at least a couple of them. I recently got a new computer and wanted to play some GTA  with mods and stuff but I couldnt even get the base game working. I didnt have a computer capable of running it back when it came out so I guess I missed out on that game and probably wont be able to play it until Rockstar rereleases it on a new console and everyone has to repay for the same game.,pcgaming,d571cn6,39,t5_2qhfg
8236686,0,t3_4s5p2q,gtValve promised that if Steam goes down worldwide they will do everything they can to keep games working and libraries intact. With games that only use their Steamworks API Valve actually has ability and power to do this. DENUVO like any other DRM provider promised nothing to gamers. And they are in no position to distribute fixes and updates to gamers.Somebody is going to get led down the wrong path by this.Somebody sent an email to Valve about DRM. Maybe it went to Gabe Newell directly I dont remember. The response they got was that if Steam goes away Valve would like to remove the DRM so that games are still playable but there was never any guarantee or promise behind it. It was only something one person expressed a desire to do. Any number of technical or legal limitations could prevent that desire from becoming a reality. Furthermore the only source on this was one email that was sent to one person that contained a personal response. It was not a public statement that was approved by PR that and meant to be circulated as gospel.Also unless you have more information than I do it is dishonest to assume that Valve has the ability and power to do this for any game that use Steamworks API. It is quite possible that publishers will not legally allow it. Perhaps you have seen agreements Valve made with publishers saying that Valve can remove the DRM if Steam falls but unless you have dont assume.,pcgaming,d5753fn,1,t5_2qhfg

8244784,0,t1_d584si6,It is a breach of contract with Steams EULA to purchase games in one region with the intention of selling itusing it in another region. Yes it does fuck over developers when most of those arent just bought in another region theyre bought with stolen credit cards and sold for  the price. Even f its not literally  of keys being stolen theres clearly a large portion of them that are stolen. Thats proven by the fact that developers on multiple occasions have stripped thousands of keys from them that were stolen. Look at major game examples customer service tickets in three days over AAA games being revoked because they were stolen keys. We can assume that not everyone that got screwed over submitted a ticket as well. Almost k stolen keys sold in three days I repeat. And this is only when they actually crack down on it theres no reason that massive credit card fraud should be an isolated instance. Once again the fact that they make you buy insurance against purchasing stolen property should tell you all you need to know. What about the recent scandal where ga fucking blackmailed an indie dev after selling  stolen codesSo fuck that of course its your right to not use it.

8399981,0,t1_d5rc1aj,Its not  Valves job to maintain games. Their games work greatSteam itself works basically as well as it does on windows with a fewthings like Vive support and broadcasting off the top of my headmissing. Vulkan isnt Valves responsibility either. Some things justtake time. Gabe has said in the past that he didnt anticipate it beingan overnight thing and at this point if Microsoft locks downeverything to the windows store valve has a valid way out. Its goodenough that they could bail if they HAD to.At this point it is up to developers to actually follow through withpromises. All valve can do is offer support and pay developers to bringtheir game to the valve platform... but giving priority to your ownplatform kind of defeats the point.Also being a wrapper  does not matter. Having crap performance  doesmatter. the Doom beta ran amazing on linux through wine. I would take awine wrapped port that gets fps over a native port that gets fpsany day of the week. eON has improved  and the witcher  port works finenow.I have  out of  games with Linux clients but Ive been only buyinggames with linux support for a while now.It takes some sacrifice I cant play some XBPS exclusives on mywindows either so some exclusives are just something to accept. Andvalve is still making updates to SteamOS its not completely abandonedits just to a stage where theres not a ton of huge development to bedone on it its into more of a wait for the games to be releasedstage which is not  on valve to do. Adding in steam broadcasting isdefinitely on a smaller scale of importance than being able to launchgames at all.Steam for Linux is in a pretty good place and going forward will be smalleriterations than before because the remaining issues are smaller. Andjust because they are fully investing in Linux does not mean they arespending  of their time on linux. SteamOS isnt going to pay off forquite some time even at  time invested so they need to make surethey keep the lights on by handling their real money maker until thepoint where Linux is paying off.,pcgaming,d5rjlgt,16,t5_2qhfg

Someone at Valve obviously liked the look of my game and let me through despite the low number of votes maybe the high  made a difference.

Unfortunately  of MMOs I play involve the same rinse and repeat side quests until level cap then just run the flavor of the year dungeon until the next one comes out. Games like Star Wars Galaxies and Anarchy Online were great because I remember the developers interacting with the community more often. Random side events would pop up hosted by GMs just to get the players more involved in the story. I remember Darth Vader landing on Tatooine and then Luke walking up to him and having a conversation then suddenly force pushes him away and a balls out war just starts taking place with players from both factions landing from different planets and joining the fray. Stuff like this unexpected randomness is what makes a fun MMO. Not kill NamedBoss for the th time hoping to get that  piece of rare gear. Make every encounter meaningful and let you walk away with something be it gear or the experience. ,pcgaming,d63vwa3,1,t5_2qhfg
8500010,0,t3_4w0a1o,A lot of the stuff in this thread are just people listing their favourite games. Like I fucking love games like Fallout New Vegas its biggest flaw being the janky ass engine there are lots of mods to accommodate for it but no amount can really fix core engine problems Deus Ex the GMDX mod actually fixes pretty much all the problems I had with the game like the AI though but in its vanilla state it is very far from perfect Morrowind same situation as the other games mods can fix it a bit but it wont ever fix the ever present jank that is always there etc theyre amoung my favourites but man are those games flawed and far from perfect.I think perfect games are the ones that reach their fullest potential and are just great on all fronts. That doesnt mean theyre the best games ever as I said above most of my favourite games ever are ridiculously flawed.So I think games like the HalfLife series are basically pitchperfect particularly when it comes to pacing. Another example of a perfect game would probably be the Portal games as well. Shorter yet completely focused and polished games that set out to accomplish something and do it with flying colours. And there are games that are smaller yet more mechanically focused entirely are just pitch perfect in my eyes. Crypt of the Necrodancer and One Finger Death Punch are games that come to mind theyre completely centered around their gameplay with one nailing the feeling of moving with the beat in a challenging dungeon crawl whereas the other  gave off the feeling that you were playing one of those Xiao Xiao animations.Then theres Hotline Miami Brothers A Tale of Two Sons Undertale... most of the stuff Im listing are more indie games that have a very specific focus and that I feel that the games nail pretty much every aspect of what they were going for.I cant think of a lot of bigger games that nail perfection like that with having a focus and sticking with it. Some may disagree but I love how focused Overwatch is and I guess is another game I would put as perfect. It focused entirely on being a unique herobased shooter and thats what it achieved.Also on the other side of the spectrum I just love how Wolfenstein The New Order was single player only and it shows that all their effort was put into the game particularly with the incredible story and setting. I dont think I would call it perfect either but Im just spitballing at this point.,pcgaming,d641xm6,1,t5_2qhfg

We hate the idea of the bottom line but when youre being financed by outside investors and not a kickstarter or early access you have to make decisions around a projections bmetrics and c market conditions.

THAT is something worth finding when exploring the world... and procedural generation systems cannot create anything even close to that. There has to be meaning behind what you find when you explore not just shallow aesthetic variations that are ultimately meaningless.There are countless quadrillions of combinations when shuffling a deck of cards... but that doesnt make any of them any more interesting than any others.

Its a huge chat room you pretty much post that you are looking for a game and within seconds you will get a response from another random user inviting you to their channel. You join that specific discord channel and boom have a group of  people all with mics and the community is pretty good so the people you will play with are usually are pretty cool nice and not vile like most online matchmaking lobbies. Essentially its expanding your friends list times . Edit I feel like discord is growing fast and if they can implement some sort of matchmaking that takes away all the posting and stuff you have to do it could be truly revolutionary.

The meat of the gameplay revolves around infantry with a few shallow vehicles that arent very interesting. More hip firing unloading on people. There was far more tactical and countering in BF a team full of tanks and APCs? You and a buddy grab a soflam and jav. Team full of snipers? Go aggressive assault and cap on them.Ya battlefield  was super spammy at times but it felt far more tactile and strategic than whatever BF is deliver.

8803047,0,t1_d75nc77,I think so too. I wouldnt really call the first  harry potter games anything special. In fact they are pretty sub par. I played the first  games on pc and played quidditch world cup. Quidditch game on other hand i like a lot. Its basically FIFA.First  games are more like D platformers. You have to get to the end of the level which is mostly platforming and some light puzzle solving. Combat is non existent. All the boss fights are solved by using your environment basically more puzzle solving. You have these beans and card you can collect throughout the game but they do nothing really. The story telling part in those games is weak compared to say the movies. A lot of reviewers at that time gave these games .I played the th game later on years after its release. It reminded me of WB lego games minus the humor. But it was alright. I wouldnt really call it the worst.I love the th and th. Played both on PC. They practically simulated the harry potter world in those games. It felt like an RPG in all honesty. Hogwards was basically the open world and everything was very detailed. Combat was good too. You had like maybe  spells altogether and to cast them you had to use your mouse in various ways. Stuff like holding LMB and moving mouse up and down or left and right. There are many combinations and each is for some spell.The only problem with those games is that as a pc gamer i found it disturbing that it had no settings capped at  fps and such. Basically a console port.The fun ends here cause th part  and part  are easily the worst games in the series. Basically rd person shooters.,pcgaming,d76092g,2,t5_2qhfg

8808552,0,t1_d76idyk,Its a real expansion to an unfinished game regardless of whether you thought you got your moneys worth. Lets not pretend ARK is even close to a finished state. Its still got tons of bugs balance issues and awful performance. They put out free updates because that is what early access is. The game is unfinished and they are giving you the content you originally paid for. Just because you have a put a lot of time into it does not mean the game is finished or worth the asking price. There are many people who find the game unplayable due to the awful state it is in.gtThis game could have launched officially months ago and they could have taken the money and jumped ship. They didnt.They didnt because it would be a huge shit storm if they called what the game is currently or what it was a year ago a full release. If anything them staying in EA while releasing this expansion makes it even more dishonest. They avoided the shitstorm so it didnt affect the sales of Scorched Earth. If they had released out of EA then people would at least know what to expect as a finished product and let that inform their decision to buy the expansion.This DLC not only asks you to pay more when they havent even delivered what you originally paid for. It slows that development of the original product down. The ARK team will now be split across two products. They now have to put significant time and money into supporting scorched earth. Which will have its own set of problems. The base game will also take a backseat because Scorched Earth will be the main money maker for a while.,pcgaming,d76o1yk,1,t5_2qhfg

I dont think reputation has anything to do with Frosbite games hardly being a new Crysis ressources are the bottleneck.Multiplatform games need to run on the base consoles but that does not prevent them from pushing highend PCs. I mean they are designed to be scalable.You cant pin it down on consoles. The investment necessary to make a new Crysis is simply unjustifiable financially speaking. Im positive EA could instruct their teams to completely overhaul PC versions but whats in it for them ? Its money wasted. The reason why there is no new Crysis is because the PC platform is not anywhere near profitable for that to happen. Publishers goal is to survive not to kill themselves stroking PC gamers ego. ,pcgaming,d7abq1o,10,t5_2qhfg

Consoles do a lot more with the same horse power thanks to being one set of hardware and having more low level access What DX and Vulkan are partially bringing to PC. Especially since if you look at the relative performance of the cards there it appears its very much memory bottlenecked. Smarter management of VRAM could help a lot.And Witcher  is one of the most demanding games around. There are a bunch of other games that arent nearly as taxing that could very easily do it.And thats just talking max settings. Ultra style settings are often unoptimized and dont give you much visual improvement vs their cost.

8871547,0,t1_d7e7ym3,No I dont buy Denuvo products. There are a lot of reasons I dislike Denuvo not the least of which is because I think the thing that makes the PC Platform so great is Freedom. We have an exceptional amount of freedom on this platform and like all freedoms that can be used for good or ill.But publishers dont want freedom. They want control. Control of a closed ecosystem lets you do all sorts of scummy things to jack up your profits. Windows is trying to take control with their new windows store nonsense. EA tried with Origin they wanted more control. Denuvo is a big step toward them taking that control. If it becomes industry standard then a very big step toward killing the freedom of the platform will be taken.And the worst part is Denuvo does not benefit a customer one bit. People defend it and support it like its for them. It isnt. Its for the publisher. Its nothing more then a gross abject display of unrestrained greed at the expense of their  paying customers and makes me certain that if successful they wont stop there.,pcgaming,d7e8gsx,2,t5_2qhfg

9027182,0,t1_d7w4ahj,gtI dont know much about OLED above the chemical level but if they do suffer such brightness loss its probably because of the specific molecules used not because theyre organic. Thats like seeing a rusty old iron car and saying that metal is inherently a bad building material for cars.That whole metaphor just went nowhere. A car using an iron frame isnt the same as a device using an OLED display. They both degrade over time but they arent built the same and an OLED display losing some of its brightness and clarity after  years of use isnt the same as galvanisation wearing off and the cars iron being corroded after decades after use. This is besides the point as I disagreed with OP and I dont have a problem with OLED displays but using that comparison to paint the statement of I dont like OLED because I think they degrade faster than LED displays and I saw a test of it which proved my point as flat out wrong because of cars is weird to me. ,pcgaming,d7wxbtf,0,t5_2qhfg

But running a LAN connecting up and having to sit right next to someone you might not know or know what their into.The rise of individuality and online personas can make it harder to form a connection for a group of kids who have varying levels of maturity based on interactions with others who frequent discussion boards they go to.LANs were a melting pot and while youd get the odd person who was weird and wanted to show you stuff they had on Real Player  most people were there to play games  Now youd get the Bronies or whichever fandom wanting to be grouped up together and exile themselves or be exiled by others.Things that happen on a microlevel can be expanded to a macro level  also my explanations suck more its am and Im struggling to stay awake with  hours left of work.,pcgaming,d89u26n,3,t5_2qhfg

If both oculus and valve did that things would be worse off and wed have hardware incompatible games on both sides.

9329390,0,t1_d8y6q0e,Thats not why Im calling them scumbags maybe you should do more research before opening your dumbass mouth. Theyre scumbags because they released awful PC ports for past games like GTA IV because they overloaded GTA Online with microtransactions because they let it get completely infested with hackers without banning them and instead chose to ban normal players just because they had a Discord overlay on their games and because their customer support service is possibly even worse than Steam it consists of a few idiots recycling the TOS to people who were unjustifiably banned and then hanging up on them. Do a quick Google search amp educate yourself before you start mouthing off fanboy. And while its not why I called them scumbags their decision to not release the game for PC is a little bit scummy because we all know theyre gonna port it in a few years with a few new features so that they can get the people who caved and bought it on console to double dip and get it again on PC like they did with GTA V.,pcgaming,d8ykgsd,1,t5_2qhfg

Its not like GMG were able to wait until the game was out and buy a bunch of keys like a gray market site to give out. This was all for preorder sales.

9365358,1,t1_d932rp1,Well probably both get downvoted to hell but I agree. This hype for such a recent game that will still have more and better mods for a considerable amount of time regardless of the  bit kinda feels ridiculous.  rip off on consoles to bank off the mods. Great its free on pc but anyone whos modded it in pc has already played and modded the shit out of it. Just feels like kind of a waste of a remaster but obviously the easiest one for Bethesda to do. Ive already spent the time modding a full loaded stable skyrim. Why do it again? Its not like theyre going passed the  limit. Unnecessary remaster imo tho. Pointless hype for an already available game that people on consoles especially are already looking at with rose tinted glasses. We should be encouraging steps forward if anything. Not back. Recycling the same recent shit. ,pcgaming,d934jzh,-4,t5_2qhfg
9365578,0,t1_d934w6x,Rigger gargoyles are similar but not so much they were actually much more painful to deal with and very easy to overlook in more dynamic sequences of actions.What you are saying is basically why nobody will make a game like that  because people love the feeling of developing a character even if the upgrades arent adding much besides that. We have all the games with upgrades and RPG elements to capitalise on that they are just another hook to make people more willing to keep playing.A game that would slowly depower the character would be tricky to do and would need a setup where the character or their equipment becomes lost or fails but the player has the time to learn the system enough to use his own growth as a player to overcome these obstacles. It is tricky and it is interesting so I love the idea but that can only come from indies really. AAA will never try this because it goes against the char development addiction I mentioned above. ,pcgaming,d935k4z,1,t5_2qhfg

9383268,0,t1_d955c4l,Or the other way around its possible for the early hours to seem promising but later on your realise you wont continue to enjoy it. For example in the early hours you were matched against bad players and therefore had a good time. Once the matchmaking catches up and you start playing fair games you realise that the game is actually quite frustrating and you were only enjoying the early games because you were winning. After you reach a certain skill level the players discover that one particular strategy or weapon is overpowered and ruins the game. Below that skill level noone realised it yet or perhaps hadnt even unlocked it. Another example in the early hours you had few expectations for yourself so you dont really care when you lose and youre really happy when you win. After a while you start expecting to do well and therefore getting frustrated when you dont.

9445625,0,t3_5a1la0,His YouTube comment regarding quality of his videogt I get a lot of these kinds of comments so Im just going to explain how I do itgt gt I do whole paragraph takes and I do throw out bad ones. I have over four hours of bad takes for this video alone. Its just that nailing  three minute segments is very difficult while maintaining rhythm and cadence. So if I feel like I made a minor mistake that doesnt tank the overall flow I leave it in so I can get it done.gt gt I actually have a nice microphone but I have no idea how to reduce static. All of the tools Ive tried make the audio sound tinny and washed out. This is the best I know how to do. I reduce the volume of the audio to try and get the low level static out and I honestly dont even hear it in this video it sounds clear to me. Im sorry its unacceptable to you. But the idea that I put it in deliberately  because I hate my audience is kind of offensive. gt gt I also try to get the clicks out snipping the ends off the audio clip but I genuinely dont notice or care about these things myself at all. The Doom video is an exception but I played the game and made that video in a  hour no sleep burst so theres that. gt gt I recorded this audio in a hotel room. Im moving into a VW bus. I will never have a fancy audio setup. But I actually get a lot of content done. I had a cool opportunity to have coffee with Daniel Floyd of Extra Credits and he said one reason huge videos are a pain is the hundreds and hundreds of hours you can spend on video editing. I dont prioritize that. This is the only way I can make close to an hour of content per month and still maintain personal relationships and part time incomes. I have a lot of plans and a lot of life to live. I choose to be casual about my video and audio editing. gt gt Thats why I do it the way I do it the way I do it. Its not out of spite or laziness its because if I wasnt casual about some aspect of the production Id never get them done. Flat out.I wish he would spend some time in getting a better audio setup isolating it to remove static is not rocket science.,pcgaming,d9dasyb,5,t5_2qhfg

9453315,0,t3_5a6jof,I think some people might be missing the point here assuming this is accurate. Its not so much of an issue that EA wont allow anything to be bought from said countries under sanctions they should protect their business its more of that fact that previously bought stuff was also denied from what I read. Im no expert on sanctions but I dont see why they needed do that rather than just blocking future purchases. That would have effectively ended them doing business with said country countries?.That fact that they can do that regardless of TOS or legality of such actions is probusiness which gives them complete control and not in favor of consumers at all. It should not be supported by anyone who values having any type of control over items they buy. EA couldnt take physical games from these locations nor should they be allowed to take digital games.All this does is add fuel to the flame that you get treated worse by actually being a customer amp  buying said games.,pcgaming,d9e9wcr,8,t5_2qhfg

9485877,0,t3_5apf37,Humbles discount programs that interact with the Monthly provide an interesting loop.Typically buying any bundle at at least  or more gives you a  discount on monthly which would be . making it pay for itself. That is if you can find at least one weekly bundle worth putting a dollar into.Buying the Humble Bundle gives you a  discount at their store for the month too. Which can be worth it depending on your shopping patterns.So these are added bonuses to the game selection for the Monthly. Which has been fair to middling frankly.When it first started the nonhidden bonus was a game from the previous month making a monthtomonth subscription seem to be worth less. I think in February they changed that to each month being completely separate and just having a headliner from the bundle be the buyer bonus.That said the buyer bonus is probably going to be the best game in the bundle with the other games being less known or less expensive.My experience has been that the selection usually has one game I kinda wanted and  games I dont mind having and  games Id have never considered buying. The selection is almost exclusively games that have not been bundled and mostly not even discounted heavily so thus far the value has been okay on that front.So largely my attitude towards it is lukewarm.  or . a month isnt that much money and I enjoy the anticipation and unboxing as it were possibly more than the games themselves.,pcgaming,d9ic62r,1,t5_2qhfg

9550709,1,t1_d9q7ls5,For what its worth and theres no unpicking every issue in this thread I think this gets close to the truth of it. The critical community can be an echochamber and this is true for films and books and all sorts of other things. I also totally get that people get angry because this is their passion and they dont want to see it attacked.I certainly dont want to paint the current status quo as perfect trust me when I say that nobody has more opinions about who is doing good or bad games journalism than another games journalist. Weve got to complain about something in the pub you know. Ill confess to not really understanding the fuss of the GJP situation but Ill also concede that its hard to tell youre in an echochamber when youre in an echochamber that applies to both sides of this debate I think.Im also conscious of the issue you raise re playing more games for less expense than the people you write for. This is I think a big danger of our profession  and astutely put. I try to guard against it in my own writing  it factored heavily into my recent Titanfall  review  I loved the game but the price on Origin gave me pause. Ultimately I talked to friends who had paid full price for it and their enjoyment of the game gave me confidence to give it a high score.At the end of the day though all this us and them rhetoric stands in the way of actually getting to the bottom of some of these specific issues  as do the conspiracy theories. Thats what I give out my email address. If somebody really wants to talk about how this job works and why we make the decisions we do and so on then I welcome that. But I think that understanding needs to be established outside of the echo chamber  which means leaving the rhetoric behind as much as we all possibly can.,pcgaming,d9qblmz,1,t5_2qhfg

9551659,0,t1_d9qeoot,Ill list the others real quick before giving a recommendation Critical Role is streamed on Twitch utilizes various voice actors in person and is probably the most popular of the other nonHarmonquest shows I mentioned.  Its been a while since Ive checked it out so I have no clue whats going on atm. URealms Live is also streamed on Twitch and reuploaded on Youtube utilizes various people the creatorDM has worked with in the past on youtube done in tabletop simulator due to distance issues one of the PCs is a barowner in Ireland the DM lives in Canada etc. is supported through direct donations which can trigger events and consists of related or sometimes unrelated one shot campaigns as opposed to a focus on one group of characters. Its the smallest of the three. Twits and Crits is a production from Funhaus a part of Rooster Teeth. They upload prerecorded episodes on the Rooster Teeth Website with a cut down version of an episode available for free on Youtuber for nonsponsors. Initially follows a group of mercenaries as they attempt to hunt down two orc brothers that are wanted. Its between Role and URealms in popularity but it does dwarf URealms in viewership.Personally Ive really enjoyed URealms Live the creator was responsible for the original Unforgotten Realms Cartoon which helped get me into it originally. Hes put a lot of effort into improving the show over the past year and a half ranging from rebalancing the game he made a tabletop game specifically for the show getting the guys to improve on character creation the music used on the show the maps they use communicating with the fanbase etc. Of course the main downside is that because its largely a small production in comparison to the other shows mentioned it will get delayed if necessary iirc the thlast campaign of the season was supposed to be in September at the start of the season but the th barely came out two days ago. It also has the misfortune of being a time sink for newcomers all of the campaigns including side quests shorter campaigns made during the hiatus of the live show behind the scenes episodes and CC amount to roughly  hours so far which hes working on addressing by planes to make condensed narrated shorts of the campaigns.

9560075,0,t1_d9rgt4g,Case fans are really simple to replace  basically Ikealevel. Trace the fan wire back to the mobo and make a note of where it connectors. Unscrew the old fan screw in the new one make sure it points the right way and then just hook up the cable again. All done. There are tonnes of fans out there so just make sure you get a decent one and match the dimensions of your old fan. And worst case scenario you can just remove the fan and leave the spot empty case fans help but they arent essential. You can replace it later.Now graphics cards fans are a trickier deal... some are userreplaceable most arent. Likely need to do an RMA for that. CPU fans are also trickier than case fans generally you need a whole new heatsink unless its built to be serviceable but are they definitely userreplaceable.,pcgaming,d9rh4or,1,t5_2qhfg

9576358,0,t3_5c0nlu,I havent been a Call of Duty fan really since Black Ops . Ive bought a few along the way since then but usually on some kind of sale Ghosts for like  Black Ops  Multi only in a Humble Bundle etcI think the games are pretty fun but the ports are currently garbage tier. I had to apply fixes with Nvidia Inspector to get them to a playable framerate with a ik setup no OC because Im too lazy to for the moment but COD shouldnt need it They run at  now unlike outofthebox settings but I still get pretty good stutter especially in Infinite Warfare. Activision is apparently aware of the problems and is working on fixes which I believe them because theyve improved COD games in the past on PC performance wise after janky launches.MWR is basically COD exactly as I remember it but a little bit prettier and theres no promod and no server browser how important those things are to you will tell you if its worth it or not. IW is very much like Black Ops  from my limited time with each of them but I enjoy the changes to the formula. IW is a lot more fast paced than COD was and the weapon missions I got a mission to kill everyone using a sidearm only last time I played for extra exp can help add some variety to the game.In the end though its still Call of Duty youll know what to expect to an extent.,pcgaming,d9thcjk,1,t5_2qhfg

9618742,0,t3_5cr5nq,Yeah lots of shooters and a lot of good multiplayer games  but the singleplayer parts leave a lot to be desired.  Doom  The return of run and gun. Entertaining for the first half of the game after that you have already seen and unlocked everything  game gets repetetive and I just couldnt go further. I dont know about you guys but I was tired fighting the same monsters on similar looking maps using same guns. I felt like the gunplay was pretty weak compared to newer Wolfenstein games.  Gears   heard good things about it but downloading  GB on my crappy mbit internet AND using Windows Store which has a tendency to restart your download? Until this gets fixed I am just unable to play the game  sorry.  Titanfall   probably the best campaign of the year. The Titan moments were so awesome and I got Shogo MAD flashbacks from that. Guns were okay and movement was so fluid. Loved it while it lasted.. too damn short. Battlefield   Disappointment of the year. Dont get me wrong the multiplayer is beyond awesome and the opening level made me scream oh yes its CoD all over again. I was so hyped to see WW in AAA game. Last one I saw something like that was Codename Eagle. But the campaign went downhill right after the intro. Not only was it boring the vehicle sections have nothing in common with MP controls but the atmosphere itself was fucking laughable. Especially the Italian story... good lord what a bunch of crap. You went from You are not expected to survive to mawing down Austrians while running up the mountain with a machine gun and plate armor. Come on. And I finished the game in like . hours. DICE simply cannot make campagins. BFBC was a fluke. Next time just give us offline bot matches. Spare us the cringe. Infinite Warfare  It was far better than that abomination of campaign Black Ops  but its just a modern CoD game. I didnt like the whole space combat thingy but once you were on the ground it was fun as it always is. Story? Ehh. I didnt really care. It had the typical CoD campaign length so I didnt have any expectations here. TLDR. Lots of games but they were all pretty mediocre when it comes to single player except Titanfall  wish it was a bit longer. That is of course only an opinion from a salty  year old gamer. Maybe I just saw too many things but I expect more quality from AAA devs. Repetetive back to retro campaigns or short emotional stories just dont do it for me anymore. Still this year was a lot better than  and   because at least you had SOMETHING to buy and play. Prior years were completely empty when it comes to FPS games so at least there is a positive here. ,pcgaming,d9yphp3,5,t5_2qhfg

9720733,0,t1_dab512y,Yeah sorry. This is patently untrue. Every BF up until  have had private server rentals that fostered vibrant longlasting communities around each game. Private clan matches? Check. Nonclusterfuck conquest? Check. Badmins? Unfortunatelym check but this is the exception to the rule. It is the private rentals that keep these games alive long after official server support has evaporated....and I would go further that it is private servers with active adminning that have kept the game playable for years after release. Finally the only cheaters I ever encountered in BF were in official servers precisely because there is no policing. Dice released an unfinished halfassed experience yet again but without the game crashes. This time its the forced crappy  player conquest forced matchmaking for Operations and the cynical deconstruction of server rentals which serves them and their paymasters by giving them complete control over the games sunset. ,pcgaming,dabaitk,11,t5_2qhfg

Expect bigger jumps every  years when a new console releases. This one pisses me off a little   but its understandable. A much bigger issue though is that compared to gameplay from  years ago so many big budget games are simpler lazier less innovative just churned out. Dont get me wrong there are still people like CD Projekt many indy devs etc that put a lot off love into their work but right now with current hardware easily supporting the best looking games I would love to see a shift towards quality of gameplay for the next few years Im looking at you DICE UBI etc....  ,pcgaming,dae9j4f,1,t5_2qhfg

9792952,0,t1_dak49jc,Ive been reading through the comments on here and I keep seeing you say this exact same thing without really explaining anything else.The problem is that this sets a standard for the game and shows that people will buy low end content instead of actual maps weapons things that would actually affect gameplay in a meaningful way.The most recent weapon that was added to the game was the R revolver which was so grossly imbalanced that the community straight up split in half. I am more than sure that adding that weapon in caused a lot of problems for Valve that they then had to fix. Why would they go through all that nonsense repeatedly when they can just doll out skins and be much more profitable.I mean from Valves point of view why should they spend the time and money into developing new maps and weapons when they can slap some stickers on your gloves and rearrage a few boxes on old maps and make just as much money if not more.This is why people are getting upset. The people who actually play the game and dont just go to the Bellagio simulator. They want actual content but they will never receive that content if whales are there to endlessly buy keys and crates.,pcgaming,dak6zg5,4,t5_2qhfg
9794514,0,t1_dakdjas,I think I understand where youre coming from but I do blame valve. They design and implement their system so I think theyre responsible.    Its a bit of tricky subject though.   What I feel is important is that it exploits a flaw in human nature for everyone. In capitalism that might be fine but I find it morally reprehensible.   Valve knows people are going to throw money at the game because they didnt get the skin they wanted and get caught up in it hoping to get that sweet skin.    They know what theyre doing. They know people will be spending a lot more of their money because theyre not getting what theyre paid for.  And really if somebody starts spending thousands of dollars on their system that really is their system just working like they intended it to.   Hence I hold them fully responsible. On the topic of tame paying for skins at a set price is probably the fairest system. Proper DLC and expansions are also fair. ,pcgaming,dakdwct,3,t5_2qhfg
9795899,0,t1_dakbjp2,I do know there are some people that rationalize cash shop cosmetics as detrimental to their game since it takes development time to make those things which could have been put free in the game.

Personally I see it as extra income that the devs generate to hire more employees to work on the game.

I mean even games like their Ace Attorney and Monster Hunter games have been fairly solid. I dont think its doom and gloom over there at Capcom and they are failing all their IPs. Theyve had some shit releases for sure and Id love to have another Megaman or Breath of Fire but I wont hold it against them if they dont.

As soon as I enabled borderless mode I got ms constant which made the game incredibly smoother at  fps of course.Another disadvantage besides the increase in input lag which is totally worth it btw is that you have a small decrease in performance since the gpu is being shared with Windows around  or more.,pcgaming,daw5zzu,7,t5_2qhfg

9957751,0,t1_db5ig2q,I have multiple monitors at my desk and a TV in front of my couch. DisplayFusion gives me monitor profiles so that I can swap between have the monitors at the desk enabled or having just the TV enabled. Those monitor profiles also swap the audio device you set so that I can go from my headphones to soundbar. Those profiles can also be bound to keyboard shortcuts which Controller Companion can bind those to controller shortcuts.Prior to this when wanting to play on the couch I had to open up my monitor settings enable my TV make TV my main display and disable each monitor one by one while having to deal with the dialogue box every step of the way while also having to change the audio device and causing me to have to go to the PC to do so. Windows  P doesnt work for these types of set ups when you have multiple monitors. After I was done I had to go through the process in reverse to get back to my desk. It can be tedious and inconvenient and often caused me to avoid the couch.Being able to bypass all this saves time and makes it convenient enough to be on the couch more often for gaming. I can go between the TV and couch without even getting up or putting down my controller. Pressing a single button to do all those tasks at once as well.,pcgaming,db5iqte,1,t5_2qhfg

10156163,0,t3_5lagf7,When they released demo for this game in  before release I was hooked. I played it almost everyday until the game came out. I bought it for full price on release and damn. The combat is so good and versatile that its unmatched to this day. The world was full of secrets and finding them all was so time consuming but fun. Each skill you learned changed the way you played the game significantly from a powerhouse kick them to death  warrior to sneaky backstabber from the shadows  assassin. You could interact with any item and use them to your advantage in the fight. Environments were interactive. You could throw a freeze spell on the ground and enemies would slip on it! Put it next to an edge and laugh at your enemies when they slip to their death. Throw oil on the enemies and set them on fire with a fire spell which you could guide with the mouse! Kick them to spikes or fire to murder them! Block and disarm your enemies to make them helpless and then shrink them with a spell only to squish them like a bug. Elements worked together for example lightning spell on water would shock enemies in the water.Boss fights were intense and they have many ways you could kill them mostly. Story is weakest part of the game but it took you places to mess around so it did its job. Its an amazing game and I recommend every single time it shows up. Its the my top  best games of all time.edit And I didnt even mention the rope bow! The best thing in the game! You could shoot a rope to any wooden surface in the game. It didnt have limits so you could chain them next to each other and jump from rope to rope. This opened up ways to sneak behind enemies find secrets avoid death when floor broke under you and much much more.,pcgaming,dbv9a3h,3,t5_2qhfg

The first chapter introduces a lot of interesting characters and concepts but the second and final chapter is only there to undo everything. Nothing holds any weight in the first place because we already know what happens to all these characters and all the new characters and concepts disappear without leaving any lasting impact on the series as a whole.The story of V as it is now is just a  hour timewaster that also happens to explain away a decades old plothole that barely anyone actually cared about.The story has no closure. Every side mission is the same and every story mission is barely different a third of the story missions are literally just hard mode versions of previous levels. The difficulty curve and paytowin multiplayer make the lategame absolutely unbearable.I hate open world games. MGSV was the best open world game I ever played for one reason unlike most open world games it didnt control like complete garbage.

10211049,0,t1_dc1dwkt,There is at least one small team doing football for PC. Axis Football  on steamI havnt played it but it doesnt look too terrible. the models animations and graphics in general look to be about on par with Madden titles from . which...ok isnt ideal but for a small studio its actually really good progress. I imagine they could catch up pretty close to Madden within  years given enough funding. Also its important to note the bar they are trying to pass is Madden  not Madden  as  is the last Madden available on PC so ifwhen they can surpass Madden  in terms of polish and presentation mechanics etc they could actually see an incredibly huge boost in sales as in not small time indie money but more on the level of AAA sports PC titles. The devs seem pretty cool and aware of the fact that they should balance their own ideas with the wants of the community which is to have a game that is fundamentally similar to Madden in most ways. my worry is that if they get successful EA will just port Madden to PC for one year only. say  just to shut axis down and remove competition. thats probably all it would take. ,pcgaming,dc1haek,9,t5_2qhfg

10241572,0,t1_dc4rlq9,I have Doom  and KF.  Theyre really actually not better than TF.  In fact I daresay the lighting effects are better in TF.  Its a hard comparison to make applesapples precisely because so much of the set is hidden in darkness in those two games and most of TF is not obscured in that fashion.I dont have SW and havent really seen much of it.  Everything Ive seen of Witcher  leaves me unimpressed graphically.  Witcher  reminds me of Oblivion it looks so dated in every video and screenshot Ive seen.Im intentionally skipping BF because historicalpastera shooters do nothing for me.  Im a futuristic shooter person.  WW has been done to death and I cant imagine WW would be anything but even more primitive and boring to me.I had the original Crysis and Crysis Warhead.  Honestly if you go back to that era Far Cry  was actually a superior engine to CryEngine .  It looked better it had better lighting it was nowhere near the resource hog and it ran a lot smoother partially due to excellent use of motion blur.  FC managed to look and feel fluid even when it would drop to fps while Crysis would absolutely not.  I think you have an idealised memory of how good Crysis was.  As someone who ran a Crysis server I can say that I loved that engine but it definitely had limitations and some questionable design.  Then theres the optimisation they did for Warhead which actually made things worse not better.,pcgaming,dc4xtoh,1,t5_2qhfg

10279397,0,t1_dc95hho,Im so very lost in this conversation. As I understand it his videos argument went like this AMD had technically superior products competing against Nvidias  series. People continued to buy Nvidia anyways because of mindshare. This gave Nvidia more money for RampD to create technically superior products for today while AMD had less money to work with for RampD. Nvidias undeserved win back in the Thermi has rendered AMD unable to compete in todays market. All the while Nvidia continues to have more money which allows them better RampD which allows them to get even more foothold into markets like the OEM and mobile markets that help build their brand and mindshare. Conclusion AMD was dealt an unfair loss by the consumers which has snowballed into Nvidia basically being untouchable.And my rebuttal is this He only talked about their attempts at branding from the GTX HD  series and onward mostly. AMD did a pretty bad job at marketing prior to that as well choosing to put more effort in RampD to develop better technology. Nvidia put a lot of effort into their marketing and branding during and prior to Thermi. This can really be seen in Nvidias attempt at securing the OEM market. I dont know if the OEM market just wasnt as much of a focus for AMD at the time or if Nvidia was just that determined but Nvidia won that battle. As a result of Nvidias branding efforts mindshare was built and Nvidia sold more cards than AMD during the GTX  and HD  eras. My conclusion Exactly as Mikutrons comment said it feels like a copout to blame consumers or Nvidia for AMDs loss during Thermi and where AMD is today. We can talk all day about how consumers made uninformed purchases and shot themselves in the foot by purchasing a GTX  or  card instead of AMDs alternative but a company like AMD should know that most consumers dont always make informed decisions and will go with an inferior product if its from a more popular brand. But Nvidia understood that in order to gain the upper hand in the market building their brand was more important than just beating out the competition on a technical level. AMD entirely deserves to be in the position theyre in today.My point about power efficiency was just a comment on how Nvidia has continued to build their brand and mindshare since the  series and onwards not on why AMD lost to Thermi.,pcgaming,dc9856r,1,t5_2qhfg

10300387,0,t1_dcblbi9,No it doesnt really work like that you are only thinking on the chars and how they shoot. Damage movement mechanics map design objectives recoil weapon variety ammo management hitbox persistent damage health management and so on affect the game just as much.For example Overwatch has almost no recoil or really low recoil on most of its weapons and CSGO has spray patterns and high recoil on almost all weapons. At the same time this is affected by movement which is slower on CSGO and faster on OW and health you die faster on CSGO than on OW. So keeping your aim on an enemy is easier on OW because lack of recoil but harder at the same time because everyone moves more and lives for longer CSGO you die faster but who dies will depend on attack opportunity flanking surprising tool usage aim and recoil control most of the time you cant turn around and fight back.My whole point is that you get into CSGO to get better at CSGO not to get better at shooters because it will take a while to understand CSGO fully.The only shooters that are easier to get into are arcade shooters like BattlefieldCoD and Hero shooters like OverwatchPaladins because they have either streamlined mechanical skill or removed systems compared to other shooters so they are far less messy and far more friendly to understand. Getting better at them is still lots of work tho.,pcgaming,dcblryi,2,t5_2qhfg

I experienced very few driver issues. What ever BSODs I faced were mainly because of Windows updates.But honestly ask yourself which games do you wish to play.Because at this point in time very few companies are actually putting all these useful and FREE features to good use.Dont wait for these feature implementations to become mainstream. Both cards will be outdated by then.Just grab any one and get gaming .BTW you should ask the linux community if you are into linux for driver support.

Requiring a connection in an online game makes sense. After all being online is the entire point of the game. But what is the purpose of it in single player?My main concern with online only games are what happens when they decide to shut everything off? Are they going to put in an extra patch that makes it so the game no longer required you to be connected for the few people that still play it? Or will they just shut everything off and leave it to modders to figure it outwhich is what happens  of the time? This has happened countless times already. I still like to go back and play older games. Im not supporting game developers that remove that possibility.Besides once in a great while my connection does go out.

As someone who games on console and on PC what youre saying is simply not true. Big communities can be fostered around games without dedicated servers Halo    Reach  Gears of War Judgement and many others. Ive made several legitimate friends that I met while playing games on my Xbox. I used to be very passionate about Halo and Assassins Creed and still am about the older titles.

10651010,0,t1_dde8dvo,Once you see how this sort of terrain generation works it seems less impressive.You basically overlay various frequencies of a noise function  low frequency noise gets you your gross terrain features while higher frequencies generate progressively smaller details.  You dont even need to be a programmer to immediately see an easy way to do less work for distant terrain  just skip the higher frequencies.Minecrafts terrain generation is slow in part because it doesnt do anything like this.  For Minecraft landscape is split into fixedsize cubes so its not just making a surface for you to look at its making the subsurface layers as well and these cubes are either generated entirely nor not at all.  Being Java doesnt help but primarily its slow because its naive Java.For a fairer comparison try Space Engine  I think it does a much better job of handling LOD than NMS and also generates vastly superior planetsize planets  The only thing that really lets it down is smaller scale details  NMS has the opposite problem generating planets that basically all look like homogeneous cantaloupes.,pcgaming,ddekioa,6,t5_2qhfg

Design is even more important and the idea is to somehow layer silicon or form them in more  dimensional structures.

Please note that this is nonexhaustive and not a hard line. Simply removing these elements today would not ensure removal from our list of prohibited games.That sounds suspiciously like we want your game banned so even if you adhere to our arbitrarilyenforced rules well just change them to ban you again. Personally if you have a list of reasons for denying someone a service then them correcting those points and entirely eliminating those reasons should be sufficient for you to then remove your restrictions upon them. Refusing to do so even after they have complied with your terms is prejudiced.Now to be clear Twitch are entitled to refuse service. They have the right to refuse to allow anything they like but they sure as hell dont have the right to pretend that this is anything other than personal prejudice because it simply is.,pcgaming,ddm36o8,60,t5_2qhfg

Even FF has left behind the turn based combat it is historically rooted in.While yes it is one of the very very few first person REs and it doesnt have Umbrella as its centerpiece villain nor does it have the catastrophic crisis like its previous games RE is survival horror and puzzles. The action varied between over the top to scrappy.I would argue that RE is another reboot of the franchise like RE was. In fact some people think that every th game is a break from previous entries    were a series of games with tank controls and fixed cameras.   and  were another series of games with TPS and high grade of action now  probably  and  will be First Person like  is and will be survival horror like  is.,pcgaming,ddtwvln,1,t5_2qhfg

10803297,0,t1_ddsoo6p,I agree with some of your points but the rest have me scratching my head.gt Missions were very scripted walk too far away or too slow and MISSION FAILEDI would like an example of this if you can. Ive played through the SP two and a half times and have never had this happen to me a single time and yet the way you listed it here among other issues makes it seem like it was a common occurrence when I just dont see how thats possible.gt And well it was short. Way too short for a GTA gameAside from San Andreas V was the one that took me the longest to finish. GTA  and Vice City have less shorter missions and MUCH smaller maps. SA had a much smaller map too but it had more missions. GTA was somewhere in the middle.gt Then there is inferior gunplay VASTLY inferior physics and deformation.I agree on the deformation but I think thats more the result of the game having a lot more going on in the background as well as it generally being a more arcadey driving game. GTA level deformation would have made driving harder because of how bad you could total your car. I still wish it had GTA deformation but I dont think this is an objective downgrade. However I thought the character and object physics were on par. The gunplay though? How can it possibly by inferior? Its largely the same as the previous games as far as controls go but handles way smoother. Smoother transitions to cover smoother combat animations more impactful weaponsfor the most part etc.gt but the gameplay has no depth to it so I just give up after  minutes.I dont understand how this is possible. The game is the most mechanically deep of the entire series not only in terms of actions you can do during driving flying and combat but also in terms of vehicle weapon and character customizationokay you cant gain or lose weight but I never saw that as a downgrade just an overall very arbitrary mechanic in the context of a GTA game even if it was cool in SA. It also has some of the largest variety when it comes to missions definitely way more variety than  and it has the most variety in locations as well aside from SA. I just dont understand how you can say the game has no gameplay depth but praise GTA which objectively had less gameplay depth.I do agree about the humor though. Something was off about it and the writing just didnt feel like it was done by the same people as the previous games. However I also felt like the more serious tone of  actually severely detracted from the core GTA experience since that was the first game where they tried to play it off like you werent playing as a total psychopath for the first time in the series instead playing as a dude who wanted to redeem himself and build a better life but the game still let you run around and cause chaos while free roaming.  VC and SA were never dark games imo GTA has always been a comedyparody series but I think they went overboard with it in V.Also holy shit sorry for the wall of text I didnt realize I wrote so much lol.

Loved it.Would definitely recommend Vanguard to any ME players even if they hate biotics or love sniping etc. Totally turned the game around for me as I was  bored of playing until I changed class and then I played it through probably  times overall now.,pcgaming,ddvlh7h,2,t5_2qhfg

It also doesnt mention that the tweaking tool wont work unless you run it with administrative rights.Another problem is that the games framerate needs to be capped at fps. Now doing this on Nvidia is fairly simple. You just use the Nvidia control panel. Doing it with AMD is a far more complicated affair.And one thing to keep in mind is that if you have a Hz screen or something like that youre not going to be able to simply force vsync. I would recommend using a framerate cap injector but unfortunately the game like Syndicate seems to dislike framerate cappers since it tends to run at fps instead of  when capped to .,pcgaming,ddxgy8q,3,t5_2qhfg

10841269,0,t1_ddy6upf,Of the top of my head and in no particular order things I subjectively like about Rockstars open worlds more than Bethesdas They feel denser. There is barely anything that feels like filler. In Skyrim there are many dungeons that feel very alike Its fun enough to traverse their worlds that GTA never felt like it need quick travel and I think the only reason they implemented quick travel taxis was because it fits into the world The world feels much more alive. Meeting the same guy hundreds of times in the same place in Whiterun and hearing him always say the same thing isnt exactly believable More attention to details. Hitting someone so hard their glasses fall of or being able to ignite the gas leaking out of a damaged car with your cars backfire wouldnt exist in Bethesdas games even if they had cars and glasses.Obviously they are making games in very different genres and some of Rockstars techniques just dont work in RPGs but thats not what this post is about.,pcgaming,ddy77zk,13,t5_2qhfg

What the terms are saying is that neither Fig nor Kickstarter are responsible for fulfilling the promises made by developers.In the particular case of Fig backers should have far more confidence that the developer will fulfill their end of the bargain. Developers and projects are curated by Fig and Fig has a financial interest in the completion of the project and responsibility to game shares investors via the licensing agreement. Fig takes no fee on rewards.Kickstarter only has reputation to lose they make all of their money by charging a service fee on rewards before anything is fulfilled.

Depending on your location your local server could be congested or perhaps have weaker infrastructure. The Miami steam server is slower for me than Texas.Wireless speeds also differ than wired connections. A mb wifi connection will not actually work at the mbps depends on hardware anywhere from   . Wireless is also notorious for slowdowns due to everything from noise to poor connectivity to congestion. The USB device could be the bottleneck but it depends again on the hardware but also the USB format.  shouldnt have any issues as long as the controller is capable.

10969193,0,t3_5wl7uw,I dont know why people are saying it doesnt make any sense.Being a CEO is still being a CEO. Its not like they are extremely different jobs. Certainly in different fields although he was the CEO of EA Sports.Not to mention that EA is on the top  biggestmost profitable gaming publishers of all time excluding Sony Microsoft and Nintendo since all of them make more than just publish games. I think the only company in from in EA in terms of net worth is Activision Blizzard which includes Activision themselves.But I would say EA will most likely overtake them in just a matter of years. CoD is definitely dying. Unless they make the most innovative game ever it will just become another franchise that sells fairly ok. But Battlefield has been gaining track with every release and EA are investing in more and more franchises while Activision Blizzard has CoD Destiny Heartstone Diablo Starcraft Overwatch and World of Warcraft as their big names. But with CoD dying off and Destiny losing some traction since Destinys launch was pretty much like a Watch Dogs type situation I doubt those would see better sales figures than the absolute hogs EA puts out every year.,pcgaming,debe80a,4,t5_2qhfg

10973004,0,t1_debq08a,I think youre misunderstanding the point Im trying to make its less we shouldnt have highend PC exclusives because theyre anticonsumer its more PC exclusives are just as anticonsumer as console exclusives so to complain about one while ignoring the other is hypocritical. Some games simply wouldnt exist without exclusivity and if that means you have to buy a console to play them on then so be it. I absolutely agree that Sony or Microsoft walking up to a publisherdeveloper of an already finished game and saying heres a fuckton of money give us exclusive rights is bullshit and needs to be stopped.    PC exclusives are a different kettle of fish I realise. You dont tend to get the same kind of exclusivity as mentioned above because there isnt a single entity that would benefit from PC exclusives Microsoft would be the main one but theyd just go for XBone exclusivity if thats what theyre after but you do get games that could in theory run fine on consoles hardware specs meet minimum requirements keyboardmouse support not essential to gameplay etc. that arent and my point is if were decrying consoles for not offering some of their games on PC we should hold PC games to the same standard.,pcgaming,debsksk,1,t5_2qhfg

Titles that are paid to be a PC exclusive are not.I absolutely understand that and that was what I said in my last comment. Paid exclusives where the game would have been released anyway without exclusivity are a shitty thing and need to be stopped.    gtOr theyre exclusive because a console isnt capable of doing what a PC can and lowering the capabilities of the game to the lowest common denominator that is console gaming takes away from the quality of the game.    See this is what I mean PC exclusives are there because consoles cant handle it. Come on man Im not trying to start a PC vs Console thing here Im just trying to get you to accept that PC as a platform does have flaws and as much industry bullshit as consoles.

11052297,0,t1_dekkj89,The point of these p benchmarks arent for high framerate gaming its to remove the GPU from the equation as much as possible its also why they use titanX. The idea is that CPUs delivering higher FPS in the p benchmark will fair better years down the line at your preferred resolution be it p or p when the CPU and GPU demand of games increase a few Years down the line and you have replaced your GPU. A point gamersnexus made abundantly clear in their low resolution benchmarks. The idea being that you keep your CPU across multiple GPU upgrades. So a chip that is fine delivering FPS at p with a GTX  in shooter game  modern shootfare might not be fine Delivering FPS at p with a GTX  in shooter game  shootpacolypse.Now of course where this gets complicated is that p performance is probably too far into the woods p is a compromise between realistic and the what if attempting to be presented. On top of that AMD has a core count advantage and the general trend is towards better threading which means AMD could close the gap as future titles continue to thread better but then there is also the odd case that turning off SMT has lead to higher framerates in multiple titles.,pcgaming,dekrbtq,9,t5_2qhfg

It felt clunky slow path finding was bad and it wasnt snappy at all. There was a huge group of players that wanted the game to basically be StarCraft  in terms of unit control.Now DoW is exactly that aaaaand people complain about it. Yeah being a game dev must suck so incredibly hard. gt I can look past the backflipping terminator but I honestly wonder why it wasnt a powerful type of teleporter he was equipped with that also released a massive shockwave essentially doing the damage instead of the backflip.

11065942,0,t1_dem4yqy,Yeah and the sad part is that as more players leave the game it makes it harder to even change that. A big player base is needed for the matchmaking to take character levels into account. When it gets to the point where its mostly a dedicated community around with all Max level characters then level based matchmaking would make it impossible for anyone new to find a game. So that would cause new players to leave but the funny part is that putting them in games versus maxed characters also causes new players to leave.

11106411,1,t1_deqv518,The complaints about Wildlands are wildly well that may be a bit much but I wanted to have the pun exaggerated if you ask me. Its not a bad game it just has some flaws. Even the greatest games have those. Because its UbiSoft these flaws will be blown out of proportion by the haters  of gamers at this point I feel. Ive been let down by Ubi before so I get where this is coming from but the blind hatred for Wildlands is ridiculous in my opinion.Not saying its a  by far but multiplayer with friends is insanely fun. Either messing around doing stupid shit or tactically picking apart an enemy base. Id say MP deserves an  barely though.

Makes me think of the Salvador Dali painting with the melting clocks.From Dragon Age Origins Ostgar  Inon Zur presumably Aside from the great desktop menu theme everyone knows when launching DAO this tune is the one memory of the game that will always define the Dragon Age universe for me. Brothers in Arms Earned in Blood Menu  David McGarry Love the way it builds low cellos then strings then wind instruments all interweaving rising and falling and taking over for each other to carry the melody then brass instruments restate the theme until there is just the lone woodwind and the military drums. Coupled with the imagery of the menu background or the AARs you can unlock and read its such a moving piece to me. Also if I remember correctly the guy who scored EiB is none other than our Sgt. Joe Red Hartsock in the game.,pcgaming,deqzm8o,1,t5_2qhfg

11108002,0,t1_deqjql8,gt All their games are wimpering when it comes to streams vods and official trailers. I mean what do they have?Infinity Blade an iOS game. The most recent of which came out  years ago.Gears of War seems like their most popular series of all time. I assume its more successful financiallyplayer numbers than Unreal just because gaming is overall more popular than Unreal was during its own hay day. Either way GoWs latest entry was also  years ago.Paragon... Wikipedia says it hit Early Access last year and then Open Beta later that year. So I dont think its entirely fair to judge an unfinished product. That said free to play multiplayer battle arena games are so over saturated. If late s  early s were full of MMOs wanting a slice of the WoW pie MOBAs are definitely the same thing the past  years or so. Just another game on the pile of titles wanting that LoLDOTA money. I dont mean to say its a bad game I havent even played it. Just that the genre is too crowded and people arent willing to get invested in a similar title.And then that leaves us with Unreal Tournament. Im quite excited for UT but honestly I dont even know if Ill actually play it all that much. Its mostly just nostalgia at this point as I enjoyed Unreal Gold and a few of the UT games as a kid. But Im just not into competitive multiplayer nearly as much as I used to be and I dont know how much of a market there truly will be. I commend them for making what seems to be a pretty true to its original reincarnation and I hope it succeeds but we will see. Last time I installed it though it still seemed quite early on its development. I dont think there were many completed maps.So... Across the board I dont see how any of their recent works would attract much attention on twitch in the news or wherever else.,pcgaming,der2z2b,1,t5_2qhfg

I dont think that it works in everything but I dont really think that its bad in and of itself.  Attractive women are visually appealing I think it makes a game about as low brow as filling a game with purple prose makes it high brow which is to say not at all.You could make the argument that Annah of the Shadows in Planescape Torment is a fanservice character just look at her design not to mention she speaks entirely in the made up slang of Sigils slums which serves little purpose but to please fans of the Planescape setting but she fits the setting and shes well written FallFromGrace is better though. Does that design improve her character?  Probably not but I dont think it hurts it either its just part of her.

I apologise for that. Microsoft makes a ton of money from enterprise solutions. Heck consumer versions of Windows arent even significant to them. All of these solutions leverage on Windows running whatever x Win application that all these businesses require. And this stretches from traditional PCs to servers to embedded systems. Locking all of that down means betraying their enterprise customers. And not just that plenty of their other partners like HP offer solutions in the same way thatll kill them too. gt that they have the full power to do right nowAnd why arent they doing it? They have that full power. If they wanted to they wouldve done it already. It doesnt matter if they do it now or later the backlash will still be strong. There is no long term benefit to doing it. Even if they are as dumb and doing this actually earns them loads of money to be worth the public backlash do you really think they care if we push back? Windows is running on over  of all PCs right now and Linux is still a can of worms for the average user. They virtually have a monopoly on this.

11223878,0,t1_df3w0d0,I dont think the issue is gaming becoming incessantly competitive so much as the people who are becoming competitive and the attitudes they bring with them.Ive thought about it extensively when teammates are spouting off about nonsense like you suck kill yourself and I think about my days playing footballbaseball and how that behavior would NEVER fly under the watch of any decent coach. Which isnt shocking because the stereotype of pasty nerds playing games in dark rooms isnt so far from the truth in most cases and when you hear them talk to teammates or message the other team it is like they have never had a chance to compete before and either they talk faaaaaar more shit than they could ever back up or they get down when things take a turn for the worse and ride their teammates into the ground.Basically what Im saying is that people are ugly when they are given a chance at some form of competitive glory that is foreign to them. They most likely never had the chancedrive to play a team sport and to see how having a positive attitude can be infectious and how good it can feel to pick your opponent up after you defeat them and tell them they did good and encourage them to whoop your ass next time.If there had been a point in my life where I was a poor sport and told my teammatesopponents that they sucked and that they should fucking kill themselves I would have been too embarrassed to walk back on the field again.

On the other hand this is among a handful of titles that I truly feel people shouldnt pirate. This title along with Zero Horizon Dawn RE and Nier Automata so far stand out as games that shouldnt be pirated since theyre just that good.

TTK too fast  Im dead before I even know someone is shooting at me.Rounds are too short  no time to get invested in the round no time to change momentum.  Round winner is pretty much decided in the first minute theres no coming back once youre down in points.  I get one titan before the round ends maybe  if Im on a hot streak.  That makes this just an average deathmatch game.  I thought I would get to drive some mechs but its mostly just running around on foot like any other deathmatch game.Kicked back to lobby between rounds and have to wait for another match.  No momentum built with the same teammates between rounds.  I spend more time waiting for a game than playing.

11316208,0,t1_dfenyhh,gt Yes theyre subjective and people may disagree with your criticisms but theyre still valid criticisms.I dont see why him saying he felt the movement system is forced isnt valid then. I loved Titanfall  and I was pretty disappointed with s multi because I felt like the maps didnt encourage the movement well at all. As for weapon unlocks I personally quite like them. In fact I wish there were MORE. It encourages me to keep playing. However critics like Totalbiscuit have spoken heavily against this type of system saying its unfair for new players. As someone who has bought all of Treyarchs CoD games on launch Ive also seen a lot of people who play Black Ops complain about weaponattachment unlocking. gtIf you said Titanfall sucks because the wall running is stupid Id think you misunderstood what Titanfall was aiming to do. If you instead said Titanfall sucks because the wall running is poorly implemented and relies too heavily on aimassist to work properly then youve made a cogent argument that can be agreed or disagreed with and supported or refuted.Yeah but he did elaborate on it. gtthe movement system felt really forced such as there was a few places to do each thing like the grappling and suchI mean he could have maybe said more but I feel like this is a perfectly valid thing to say.

11339232,0,t1_dfh7x53,gtWhile they have a lot more control than games with medium to large publishers they are still bound to the promisesstretch goals they set up to their backers. They cant promise epic fantasy adventure RPG and end up delivering space action shooter because they changed their mind early in development.They can they can even fail to deliver completely. The kickstarterpromises arent contractually obligating promises. It would be probably the end of the studios respectability but they could do so.gtIt means youre trading in a single large stakeholder company that may demand even more control than just your promises during development for thousands of smaller stakeholders But the single stakeholder company isnt just a stakeholder its the owner. Hence why the games are called independents as the creators arent doing a work for hire.Also keep in mind that while the collecting money from future customers is novel thing to do on the internet it isnt a novel thing to do on a larger scale. Many TVproductions for example are made on a model where the TVchannel buys the the broadcasting rights for a limited time before the show is actually made on a discount against the risk that the programme isnt actually popular. The programmes are still independent because they arent commissioned by the stations.gt with that definition You cant just make up your own definitions and then claim Im wrong because I use some other definition. Heres the wikipedia definition of an independent film gtgtAn independent film or indie film is a feature film that is produced outside of the major film studio system in addition to being produced and distributed by independent entertainment agencies. Independent films are sometimes distinguishable by their content and style and the way in which the filmmakers personal artistic vision is realized. Usually but not always independent films are made with considerably lower budgets than major studio movies.And heres the wikipedia definition on an independent gamegtgtAn independent video game commonly referred to as an indie game is a video game that is created without the financial support of a publisher. Indie games often focus on innovation and rely on digital distribution. Indie gaming saw a rise in the latter half of the s primarily due to new online distribution methods and development tools. Some indie games have been very successful financially such as Braid World of Goo Flow and Minecraft.gt I usually think of whether it hits a few of the following pointsYes those are common indicators in a similar way as saying that most birds can fly and most mammals cant.,pcgaming,dfha63t,1,t5_2qhfg

11394179,0,t1_dfnh2oh,No that is not how RPCS or the games themselves work. Games are generally programmed to run as fast as possible up to an upper limit of  or  fps. RPCS is an HLE emulator cycle accurate emulation is not the goal. Therefore if your computer is fast enough the game code will be executed faster than the real hardware can. You can also already run some D games like PS Terraria at  fps with close to zero loading times. And the game isnt running at turbo speed like in other emulators it is actually outputting  unique frames at proper speed.To answer the original question PS RDR could absolutely run at a stable  fps all the time given enough development on RPCS and a fast CPU.If you dont believe me I am a moderator of rrpcs a code contributor and the person who wrote the progress report. ,pcgaming,dfniixl,5,t5_2qhfg

Fuck you you cant do that unless you remembered to bring your own Switch.Look at how they treated AMR an insanely high quality labor of love from dedicated fans.  Compare this to how SEGA and Capcom also huge nearly monolithic Japanese companies from back in the day treated fans who made fangames using their IPs.Theres a lot of reasons to dislike Nintendo.  They represent the absolute nadir of Japanese developers and are absolutely ridiculously arrogant in their behavior and treatment of their fans and consumers.

As you digitally reduce volume you reduce the dynamic range very slowly but that also lowers your own ability to hear that dynamic range since sounds get quieter so inherently less perceptible and you run into your rooms ambient noise which is quickly going to become higher than the noise floor.Youd need to lower your volume digitally and crank up your amp to potentially notice the difference but at that point youre doing it on purpose.,pcgaming,dg6447s,4,t5_2qhfg

Im not an old gamer by any means but I remember just having to wait until reviews came out on GameInformer magazines to see if the game is worth playing. Now people are crying that devs arent giving us a free demo to try out the game? Everyone in this thread has some extreme reactions. Yes Dishonored  had some bad performance issues. You wouldve known that if you just waited a few days to wait to see what the consensus was. People shouldnt be preordering games these days to begin with. If you stop giving the devs your money ahead of time you wont get your hopes crushed when a shit PC port makes you regret your purchase. DOOM didnt have early review copies and that game turned out great. Demos Betas early access reviews before the game is released are all luxuries that we are absolutely not entitled to. We are however entitled to great games that we pay money for.

Now I need to sell the steam link.I would recomm and a steam controller for games that work well with a controller mostly third person games. But for anything first person or simulation based cities skylines civ games you will want a mouse and keyboard. I endedded up finding a small lap desk the one i got has adjustable legs instead of actually sitting on your lap would highly recommend and bought a wireless mouse and a wireless  mechanical keyboard.

Campaign was pretty standard without much history one good mission with jumping in time. Multiplayer I though will be fun to me because its fast and I really liked Urban Terror and Enemy Territory they were considered fast but it turns out that gunplay is hurting because of the speed of gameplay. Shooting isnt really skill based you dont even have to control your  recoil and can shoot for really long distance. Im playing on PC and this feels more like consolecontroller FPS than aimskill oriented game. I much prefer gunplay like the games mentioned ET and UT or CSGO than this. Maybe thats also the reason Im not big fan on Battlefields and dont even want to try Call of Duty.

But if I can get my  year old mom who last played a NES not wanting to take the thing off so she can try for  again in bowling or explore another city in Google Earth I can probably find an experience everyone would really enjoy. Any game will only entertain for so long VR or not. Thats why people buy new games. Great thing about VR is there are always new experiences or ways youre playing to try out. Youre not stuck there alternating between Battlefield  and Counter Strike Gold Version. One game youre in a submarine using a periscope and loading torpedoes.

And only for the people who choose to pay for it. I watch youtube all the time but if something happens where I have to pay more money to watch youtube Im simply not going to do it. If I have to pay more money to watch netflix on top of the subscription Im simply going to stop watching netflix.This will apply to many other people as well. ,pcgaming,dgtzu2v,1,t5_2qhfg

11774042,0,t1_dgujvkn,Thats because in the EU the cost is partly socialized and population to land density makes providing everyone with good coverage a far easier affair. There are a lot of reasons small businesses in this country are not as able to compete with larger corporations and almost all of them have to do with government regulation as well as central bank monetary policy in the case of the banking and finance sectors we could get into that btw.   I have no faith in the federal government whatsoever but it is true that you can have better public policy in one government versus another doesnt mean we need we need governments in the first place. You dont force people to compete competition relies on the noninitiation of force from state intervention in order for genuinely helpful incentives to materialize on the part of market participants. I can give you plenty of examples from the federal registry of what happens when government begins to heavily regulate an industry. If your a traveling merchant for example you can be arrested for selling goods at too low a price. If your in the trucking industry you are not allowed to simply enter the business of transporting consumer goods to retail centers because monopoly leeway rights have been granted in addition to licensure obstacles which of course are not overseen by the state so much as by the companies who are already wellestablished in that industry. You can go on and on down the line the healthcare industry education banking the most regulated sectors of the economy are routinely and habitually the most corrupt and anticonsumer.   Removing these regulations is exactly what we need to ensure equality of opportunity visavis new entrants into a given industry or profession just as the data I mentioned earlier has borne out. In Hong Kong and Singapore for example the least regulated countries on Earth where are all the monopoly corporations? In fact Hong Kong and Singapore have a far greater percentage of employment in small businesses than that of America. Yes there are very large upfront costs associated with providing Internet service but nothing in the kind of environment Im advocating to you is stopping a Google or whoever else from coming in and disrupting it. The reason for this is simple if ISPs really do start charging too much  that is they charge an excessively higher price than the underlying cost  then that attracts new competitors who see the opportunity to gain market share taking it away from the established ISPs. This happens all the time in markets investors and entrepreneurs are constantly looking for where profit and market share opportunities might be and the more the ISPs raise their price beyond that which can already sufficiently support a successful company the more they will attract new contenders.   On your other point who are you to tell people how much they should value safety over price? Yes a U.S. car may be safer in some respects but its also made a lot less safe by fuel standard regulations that can only be met by keeping the car unnecessarily light in weight using flimsy or inadequate concentration of materials to meet those fuel standards. In addition consumers have to pay a much higher price and now were getting into one of the main reasons why the U.S. auto industry is less successful than it once was. These are decision that should be left to consumers we dont need some bureaucrat to tell us what we want we will tell you businesses through profits and losses. Thanks for the discussion btw. Oh and yea pollution is a genuine externality issue but it exists in staterun societies as well you think the Soviet Union didnt have pollution? They literally had signs next to rivers warning you to be careful because they were flammable from all the dumping that went on for lack of private property. Also China is going through what we already went through a period of much more crude industrial development lots of factories but yea I agree more attention should be payed to remedying this but I trust markets to come up with a solution not the state. ,pcgaming,dgumekc,0,t5_2qhfg
