504930,0,t1_cfx6ylf,One because the schools in the area have already been built around a gendersegregated communal bathroom plan and a lot of people arent comfortable sharing a bathroom with someone of the opposite gender especially women for some reason. Some schools lack unisex one hole restrooms altogether or have very limited options when it comes to unisex restrooms. Two because the issues faced by transgender students extend further than just bathroom options. As the article notes while most people are interested in the matter of bathrooms and locker rooms there are other issues like how staff refer to the student  both in name and rdperson pronoun. Additionally schools need to determine how to handle  transgendergendernonconforming students in regard to dress codes and sports eligibilityparticipation.

1560053,0,t1_cjbrvlv,Ill admit that Im probably an outlier in my experiences but Ive seen a lot of shit go down all across the city.Heres a list of every incident Ive been involved in or witnessed that resulted in a call to the cops. I dont know that I expect anyone to actually read it because its fucking long but here we go. Shortly after moving to the East Side I had my car vandalized. I parked it on the street because I had left my garage door opener at my dads house out of town. Came out the next morning to find that about half the cars on the block had been keyed. Several months later I had my car keyed again in the garage. Honestly I suspect that this time it was one of the managers of the apartment building I lived in I parked my car next to his and I had just made a complaint about the guy for his behavior.I then moved to Riverwest where I dealt with the following Several times from  am to am I had people knock on my windows. They would go from my front window around the side of my apartment and knock on my kitchen and bedroom windows. It might have been people who lived there trying to get into the building but I was in no way about to go out and mess with somebody who thinks that trying to wake people up at am is an okay thing to do because theyre obviously not right in the head. If it was just a oneoff thing it wouldnt be a big deal but this happened occasionally for the entire time I lived there. I came home from classes one day to find someone had lit the dumpster on fire. It was threatening to ignite a large pine tree that could have easily lit the building on fire. I had a knife pulled on me by a neighbor. To be fair I put myself in this situation. It was am or so and this dumbass had been honking the horn for the past half hour because someone parked in his spot we did not and never had assigned parking. I went out sleepy and frustrated and told him politely and then lesspolitely to shut it the fuck up and stop acting like a child. Just after getting off the bus my fiancee had a water baloon filled with semifrozen piss and a screwdriver thrown at her by a passing car. Someone tried to gain entry into my apartment in the middle of the night. I woke up to them turning the door knob and fiddling with the locks. They then tried to push the door down but were unsuccessful. They left before the police arrived. That is when I ended up getting a shotgun.Frustrated with Riverwest well mostly my apartment management really I rented a house which Ive since bought on the south side. EDIT I feel like I should mention this isnt a shitty neighborhood. The median income is almost exactly at the city median and so is the average home price. On crime blotters the neighborhood actually has no more going on than most other decent areas Here Ive dealt with the following My garage was vandalized with graffiti. Honestly it wasnt that big of a deal and I just spraypainted over it. I suspect it was some kids from the neighborhood but I dont know to be sure. I had various things stolen from my back yard. The first thing was a furniture dolly I used to move itI figure one of the garbagepickers saw it I know I shouldnt have left it outside I had forgotten it was there until I was going to bed and then I though eh forget it..nothing will happen to it. I later had some yard furniture like plastic chairs and stuff taken. I didnt actually call the cops about this but one knocked on my door asking if I had seen anyone stealing from yards apparently a neighbor had a birdbath or something like that stolen from their garden and called...Im not sure on the details there and I mentioned that Id had things taken from my yard as well. I had my house broken into and lost a bunch of electronics. Ive mentioned this on Reddit before but it really affected my sense of safety at home and in Milwaukee generally. This was the moment that really made me realize that this town had some serious problems with crime. To make it worse we discovered this while returning from the vet to have one of our pets put down. On the bright side the fuckers who did it were caught and arrested several months laterthe police picked them up for another burglary and found some of our stolen property in their house...the police had an entire evidence room at one of the stations dedicated to the stuff these assholes had stolen. If it were up to me these scumbags would be dropped off on a deserted island somewhere and told youre on your own. People who do that shit shouldnt be allowed to live in regular society. I witnessed someone trying to gain entry to a nearby house. I shouted what the fuck are you doing? and they ran off. For about an hour someone stood out behind the apartment complex kittycorner from my house and threatened residents asking if they knew somebody in the building. He kept repeating he was going to fuck him up. I witnessed somebody from that same building shoot a firework towards my nextdoor neighbors house. Not a bottle rocket one of those big fucking ones. It zoomed past the house missing it by about six feet and exploded over the street.While outandabout in the city Ive also dealt with some incidents On the way to the Target on Miller Park Way at about pm I detoured through the near south side just south of Lincoln its not the greatest neighborhood really. Someone tried to carjack me. They threw an object out into the road that I had to brake for and several people tried to surround my vehicle. Before they could I spotted a gap and put my gas pedal to the floor I would absolutely have run one of them over if necessary blew the next streetlight and then called the cops. Ive reported several cars for driving recklesslyweaving like the driver is drunketc. My favorite is the guy who was driving down Prospect and then Wisconsin avenue with smoke just pouring out of his muffler. When he would stop at lights I was behind him the smoke was so thick I couldnt even see his tail lights.TLDR The list of things that have caused me to call the cops since moving here about three years ago is so long that you took one look at it and said nope.,milwaukee,cjbtqlf,6,t5_2r7dt

3503699,0,t1_cprn5ul,Some reasons that I would agree withgt This is a middle finger to anyone who paid to go this festival. You claim to be one of the premier festivals in America and then you go ahead and hire someone like Paris Hilton. She is a disgrace to dance music and is a perfect example of what spoiled celebrities do when theyre bored. She has no right to be paid good money to stand up there and clap her hands on a stage. That money could be used to hire credible djs that actually work hard on their craft. If Paris has any respect for dance music she would step down as shes clearly not worthy. Signing her to Summerfest is supporting a false non credible and quite frankly overall terrible musicianDJ. This diminishes dance music as nothing more than a cheap show and if you have any respect for the integrity of music you will remove Paris Hilton from the lineup. Please sign and share this petition together we can at least show Paris that we wont stand for this.TLDR summerfest should be about real musicians performing their craft.,milwaukee,cprna8w,-9,t5_2r7dt

Have the skyline up top and the water on the bottom of the banner to put buttonsheaders onto.Im not sure if we would run into issues with using the brewers or MKE Tool logos but hopefully not. Those are just my two cents on it I look forward to hearing other suggestions or seeing one of these come to life.,milwaukee,cq38yry,1,t5_2r7dt

Go to a cafe not Starbucks maybe Rochambo sit and chat for a while over coffee and a snack then go to the museum and wander for a couple hours and then go somewhere for a laid back late lunch like Cafe Hollander.Youre still new to the relationship so all of these things will let you get to know each other better. Youll have lots of opportunity to talk see what she likes in art and where her tastes are and generally get to know her better. All that shouldnt cost too much.  coffees and snacks  museum admission for   and lunch . So less than  for the two of you.Plus this will just be a nice day that you took the time to plan out.

Both of those two units are in pretty rough shape.  But Ive seen the doors of other units when theyve been open and some look really nice.  If you do look seriously there be aware its a college building.  Parties go on every weekend and during the week.  The noise inside the apartments isnt bad but everyone always ends up out in the parking lot yelling.  The windows are pretty old and bad so you just end up hearing yelling all night if you have a bedroom in the back.  Oh and theres some bros who play bags at ungodly hours either on the sidewalk out front or in the lot out back.  Just repetitive THUNKS and periodic screaming all day and night long.  Really if it wasnt for the shitty neighbors itd be alright.  Heat is included for sure cant adjust it thought  radiators and I think basic cable is included as well. Part of the TWC bill is anyway.  Theres coinop laundry in the sketchy ass basement.  Also theres no AC.  Might not seem terrible but last summer was pretty rough there.

Their employees are a reflection of the surrounding population. Substandard customers and substandard employees. Not everyone is like this but enough are so that you notice. And its not just Walmart. Go to the Home Depot on Port Washington Rd then go to the Menomonee Falls or Grafton stores. World of difference as far as helpfulness and competence. Store management doesnt know or doesnt care. When was the last time you saw a store manager at Walmart? Me neither. The days of Sam Walton touring the stores is history.

6599170,0,t1_czxa4q6,Nope I live in Milwaukee. I had my car stolen last March from the street outside my house. They found it  hours later on the block that this incident happened with no engine no transmission the back seat busted out and everything gone. It was stripped in plain view and nobody called it in. I had been laid off from my job before this so I had no job and no car. I only had liability. I borrowed cars from friends I took the bus I rode my bike and I eventually got a job and bought a new car. Yes it fucking sucks to have your car stolen yes I was angry that it happened and angry that nobody who saw it being stripped called the police. Yes Im angry that the police didnt do shit to figure out who stole it. I had to pay  to have my car towed from rd and Scott at am on a Monday morning. I got parking tickets because I couldnt alternate side park a car with no engine and when I called the parking enforcement to give them my incident number so they wouldnt ticket me what the officer told me to do the woman on the phone laughed at me. My new tires had k miles on them and cost over  and my whole car got me  from a scrapper who finally towed it away. I didnt get any money from insurance. I still would never kill somebody over an object like a car. But yes make assumptions about my experience in life. Ive lived in many different Milwaukee Neighborhoods Ive had my house broken into Ive had my garage broken into Ive had my bike stolen my car stolen Ive played the game fireworks or gunshots but I would never open fire on an unarmed person in the street of my city for stealing my car.

7402050,0,t3_4fuvsc,I used to be VERY against all of these developments but now I welcome them.  After experiencing the renting hell that was Denver the last few years I would rather see Milwaukee get ahead of the times and build now.  Denver hit a record low vacancy rate post legalization and average rents went from  to  in a few years.  People renting month to month were getting hit with  increases every few months. Now that the city has injected an insane amount of development the rents are finally starting to stabilize.  So for Milwaukee as I see myself coming back in the next few years I hope they continue to add units to prevent a potential rental crises.  The only thing I disagree with are all of the units going up in Bay View but that might just be me being bitter.  I would hate for it to turn into SoDaSoPa.  ,milwaukee,d2jkboe,1,t5_2r7dt

Theyre having a  off sale for the next threeish days if you open a card.Whatever you get you should be looking for a basic navy or charcoal. And whatever you get make sure to get it tailored this will be automatic at JAB or BB but if youre getting something offtherack or online youll need to find a tailor.,milwaukee,dgx18yi,2,t5_2r7dt
