Same goes for most TDE projects tbh though Soulos latest album left something to be desired even after multiple listens and reflection.Agreed overall though there was a discussion about how Yes new album was pushed back or something?

4644275,0,t3_3ekqkz,The biopic isnt cancelled Singleton got fired and replaced.However theyve been trying to make this film since  and its never got past the preproduction stage.Singleton has walked about before on the same biopic because he wanted to make another film first. Know what that film was? The cinematic abortion that was AbductionI would take his reasons why he left he was fired with a pinch of salt. Other more experienced directors like Antoine Fuqua left the project because he couldnt find a single actor who he thought made a good Pac and didnt want to be known as the guy that fucked up the Tupac film. Singleton was hired then quit to make abduction after months of stalling this infuriated morgan creek. He came back saying he found an actor that was suitable Marcc Rose and this still stalled production for over a year. Morgan Creek thought he was having cold feet again and waiting for another Abduction like project to land on his lap so to stop delaying the project anymore All together singleton has delayed it by four years alone they fired him Singleton then went on an internet rant about that he quit because they didnt respect his legacy etc.The truth is probably this Boyz n the hood is great but singleton hasnt made a single hit in over a decade. All of his films the last  years has been garbage. Like Fuqua he doesnt want to be known as the director who butchered a Tupac film. Biopics are notoriously hard to pull off because audiences already know the character inside out so they always feel two dimensional bar one or two classics. Since Singleton has struggled to even make fictional characters come alive the past decade hes gotten cold feet on Tupac again.fin.,HipHopImages,ctfz5e2,12,t5_2vnph
