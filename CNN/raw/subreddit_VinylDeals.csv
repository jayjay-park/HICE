You should be asking one of these guys who says there are much better preamps out there should chime in with their thoughts on upgrades. Edit Actually it doesnt look I said that here. Anyway I think the pre sounds fine. But if it doesnt suit your needs just switch it off and use whatever you like.

11670983,0,t1_dghp4c5,Im happy for you for sure but by and large these pressings were beset with so many problems.  Personally the June album release was dirtier than any new pressing Ive bought other than Elbows Build A Rocket Boys! that has someones hand print in every single firstpressing copy apparently.  Then the deluxe set while sounding marginally better had sticky residue all over both LPs outer edges and the replacement one arrived without sticky residue but was dirty but LESS dirty than the original storebought release in June.  Confusing? Painful? Yes. Psyched for you though!  Haha,VinylDeals,dgix6zn,1,t5_2tw3u

Its actually helping me with an ongoing dilemma I have on whether or not to import from the US for cheaper. Ive had one helluva scan of the record and cant see anything too obviously detrimental to it that would cause it to be as poor as it is. The Jamie XX press is renowned for being terrible though and Ive either been incredibly unfortunate or Ive put  together and made ! I considered travelling to London to see them but money was tight. Itll be one helluva gig! ,VinylDeals,dgyh8pb,0,t5_2tw3u
