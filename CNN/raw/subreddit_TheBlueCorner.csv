11424861,0,t3_6318de,For the placestart idea why not have the window title just be rthebluecorner and surrounding our corner.It would serve both as a sign and actual art to protect. We can let the old sign to the wolves since it seems its heavily covered anyways. The bullet can take its place.,TheBlueCorner,dfqzvxa,2,t5_3jsax
