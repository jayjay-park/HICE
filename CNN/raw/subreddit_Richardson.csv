6024826,0,t3_3xxxe7,Tried it just a couple weeks ago.First a warning They serve street tacos and absolutely NOTHING else.  They have like  street tacos on the menu to pick from and thats it.  Ok well they do have frozen horchata too but nothing else to eat.The street tacos are good.  They toast the tortillas so theyre just a little crispy and I liked the flavor of the meat I actually cant remember which two I picked.  I would say  would make a good meal and IIRC they are . apiece.  Overall it didnt leave a big impression on me but I imagine the next time I have a craving for street tacos it would really hit the spot.,Richardson,cy9dkne,2,t5_2u6qz
