We all A few times in my life Ive had moments of absolute clarity. Both of these works were published in Berlin at the time when Hitler was coming or in power and being gay was not tolerated. Probably the greatest influence on my writing and the bar against which I measure all literature not just LGBT lit.Mother took over at a very early age says Bachardy. His father discouraged his interest in the movies and would rather I had gone into sports and been like the other boys. After high school he enrolled at UCLA but hated it. I was going only to please my father something he tried to do with great regularity.In turn when he met Ray Bradbury in a chance encounter in a bookstore he wrote a glowing review for his The Martian Chronicles that helped launch the latter s career as a novelist. They too became close friends. A couple of years ago I read Isherwood s The Berlin Stories which was actually composed of two novels Mr. Norris Changes Trains  and Goodbye to Berlin . This probably explains the subtle treatment that Isherwood used in depicting gayness in these novels.There he fully indulged his taste for pretty youths. He went to Berlin in search of boys and found one called Heinz who became his first great love. Commenting on John Henry Mackay s Der Puppenjunge The Pansy Isherwood wrote It gives a picture of the Berlin sexual underworld early in this century which I know from my own experience to be authentic. In  he met Jean Ross the inspiration for his fictional character Sally Bowles. He also met Gerald Hamilton the inspiration for the fictional Mr Norris.Sorry I needed to type that just one more time. He pushed his sons to study hard and he deplored daydreaming films and Bachardys talent for drawing. During the early months of their affair Isherwood finishedand Bachardy typedthe novel on which he had worked for some years The World in the Evening . In  he fell in love with Don Bachardy an eighteenyearold college student born and raised in Los Angeles.Auden and Isherwood became Auden s literary mentor and partner in an intermittent casual liaison. Nollendorfplatz is in the Schneberg district of Berlin and is on the UBahn lines U U U U. Judging from Wiki s entries about Isherwood s life this novel seems to be semiautobiographical so it feels sincere truthful honest. Why you wouldnt recognize love if you met it!.   ,musicimlisteningto,cxcf5fo,1,t5_2wdck
