6869427,0,t3_49r3j2,This was helpful. I only played a few games many ended after  seconds when I spawned next to enemies but really enjoyed the concept so far. I do wish there was a way to quickly see what things are without holding the cursor on them. Unless Im missing something...,cure,d0uylcg,1,t5_2sq0x
6883636,0,t3_4a09ky,If anyone runs into this error please see It will have a way to download the game without the launcher.This is sort of a large scale test for us and many people are able to patch just fine but we are finding a few people that run into this issue. We will attempt to fix this in the near future so it works for just about everybody.Thanks for your patience!!,cure,d0wkrb3,3,t5_2sq0x
9681904,0,t3_5dptch,I agree fog of war has its benefits but it makes more sense that once you travel over an area you can see it forever. Maybe only the colonizers could permanently reveal the map since theyre like scouts in this game.But correct me if Im mistaken dont the pathogens remain on your map after you found them? So its not like youre constantly blind as to where they are. You could make a few colonizers swim around fast and find them then send in soldiers.,cure,da6hyvo,1,t5_2sq0x
