1581510,0,t1_cjdnyzj,Now Im antiHamas as much as the next guy but saying both sides have blood on their hands is the understatement of the century.Hamas missiles barely ever do any damage and barely ever hit any civilians.Israel on the other hand are overfunded and shooting blindly in the civilian population I mean come the fuck on Hamas kidnapped ONE soldier today Israel retaliated by sending a massive barrage of missiles and killing  people just today.Also a little known fact all Abrahamic religions are considered Semitic so the fact Israel is killing Christians and Muslims in Gaza is antisemitism.Right now Israel is the same as Al Qaeda ISIS or even Hamas keep in mind I have no problem with the Jews or even the Israeli people when they arent overreacting like a retarded child on crack.I truly believe Palestine and Israel can coexist peacefully without Hamas and the religious bigots running Israel.,Jewish,cjeitfn,4,t5_2qtts

4812788,0,t1_cu16qdq,gt And dont talk to me about uwhatmichelledoes and uheresallama if they were to get out of line namer could delete them as mods and they effectively do some dirty work. unamer takes his orders from uyoelish and ucubits. They wish to censor conversation and have an agenda for judaism on reddit. They think judaism should only be discussed in hebrew by neortic senile people. wow. this is the cherry on top for you. ,Jewish,cu16x89,4,t5_2qtts
4813307,0,t1_cu0srg3,Eh.  As a liberal Jew I definitely feel the minority when Im in rJudaism.  I really dont want to deal with subreddit drama or any drama but if rliberalJews actually has liberal Jews and discussion of liberal Judaism I wouldnt mind a place where our opinions are actually valued as opposed to being considered heretical by the majority similar to rJudaism compared with the wider community.  Not to mention that a haven for liberal Jews might be a place where we dont have to continuously walk on eggshells to prevent giving offense to the people with whom we disagree.  Basically I dont think its a bad idea to have a specifically nonOrthodox Jewish subreddit.  Will it be successful?  Meh.  Who knows.  Maybe it will get tainted by this drama or whatever.  But in principle its really not a bad idea I think.,Jewish,cu19a5p,2,t5_2qtts
