I am sure there are diminishing returns in this game like souls but cant say for certain.If your talking about skills if all you use is spears then get them all.

8804427,0,t1_d75eddo,This is the sole reason why I have drastically reduced my play time in the beta. I am stuck on the first boss not because he is impossibly overly difficult but because I refuse to use an elixer unless I get his health down to a certain amount. Simply because I dont want to waste the few elixirs I have in my inventory in the event I die which I do....every time..... Then I end up dieing grabbing maybe an elixer from the dude under the shrine and restarting the fight. In bloodborne elixirs dropped all the time and they refreshed your inventory as soon as you respawned. In DS you increase the number of charges as you go and get them all back when you die.

10399243,0,t3_5ovwzr,Its not a reskinned Dark Souls but it is the same style of game. This is honestly the first game Ive seen done is Soulsborne style that bothered to introduce enough new elements to make the game feel unique so theyve done a good job not just copying what From Software has done. I found it much more enjoyable than Dark Souls  but then again I love Dark Souls as a series and still find  to be the weakest game in it despite  being pretty flawed as well.My advice is to just try the demo theyre releasing this weekend and see how you feel. Honestly I think the barrier for entry is much higher here than in any Dark Souls game as Nioh has systems that require more micromanagement and is a lot less forgiving than even the hardest Souls game.

10448801,0,t1_dcs9zwc,Hes definitely a bastard but much easier if you level up first.I agree that his Iai Slash is overpowered but its also his only real strength and fairly easy to outrange or you can play around the rock.My bigger complaint was the fact that while he exhausts himself quickly leaving him open to critical attacks he also never actually runs out of stamina. A player can exhaust themselves completely and will stagger but even fully depleted he is able to continue to attack and dodge. It forces you to hit him to stagger which is difficult due to the aforementioned infinite dodging.

Bosses seem to be a lot easier than BB thus far but enemies are always a challenge unless you have your shit together. Always fun fighting the Yokai.I can not rate it on a scale since the difficulty changes from area to area and mission to mission and I have yet to play any twilight missions but overall it is harder than dark souls   That game is a fucking Iframes simulator and around the levels of BB.Customization is fucking mental though.

If flying block daggers dodge paralysis blasts. If diving at you dodge. After enough triangle punishment she will run out of ki. Stay away from her when she is first getting up cuz she will try to drink your blood right after getting her ki broken. Then blitz her til she gets her ki back. Rinse and repeat. Oh and if you have shuriken or Kunai hit her with those every now and then for some more ki damage.

10741826,0,t1_ddnwsns,Honestly Im not entirely sure the description only reads that it enhances damage based on your ninjutsu power.  I dont know if it applies to all damage but it certainly seemed to affect close combat damage.  It doesnt show on your listed damage on the status page if you remove a piece of the set and put it back on but it seemed to make a noticeable difference in damage dealt to enemies.  Truthfully I wish I had tested it more before respeccing hopefully someone will break down all the ambiguous damage modifiers or it will be explained in the future guide.,Nioh,ddnxs6w,1,t5_39y47

10751286,0,t1_ddovxy5,Are you saying they can be random drops as well or that the are obtainable at a higher level later in the game? Example The Two Kings duel. Edit I guess uMaxinRudy confirms random drops at least in region .I havent personally seen a single random WOTW drop so I find it hard to believe that  of revenants with this gear have it at roughly their level because they got them from random drops.If people were getting them from higher level quests ie two kings then you would expect to see a large amount of WOTW gear around level  and then a slow petering off until level  where people are able to farm the higher level version. This isnt the case though.You can continuously farm revenants for WOTW gear from  all the way up to at least  where I am right now. I dont expect this trend to end. Im getting level  drops from revents getting a level  WOTW piece would cost more than double my total gold earned up to this point and I havent spent any. I dont see how its possible for revenants with this gear to have it at such high level if this is the case.,Nioh,ddowvcl,1,t5_39y47

10766137,0,t1_ddqdy2m,As life expectancy increases so does the initial cost. So thats not a real solution to the issue. You just admitted your current computer has technical issues. Computers will always be more finicky than consoles based on design alone. You see more consoles crashing because the console players base is several times larger than pc. Not a very good point on your part.You only mention select titles that a lot of people play. The player base I suggested was for console players vs. Pc players in general not specific games. If you want to look at specific titles that are on both platforms like sfv ffxiv or bf you know more people play them on console than pc. Consoles have more major title releases every year than pc. No one cares that your five thousand dollar computer can play pong. Most games that the pc gets are ported versions of console games that are released months later. So again pc gaming may be better in terms of visual experience but it definitely has its own set of problems. Not everyone wants to drop  grand for a graphics upgrade thats only relevant for a year or so. ,Nioh,ddqg3zi,-2,t5_39y47

10783006,0,t1_dds5dgv,I mean it kinda did. Nothing wrong with that in gaming though. Plenty of games steal from past games and improve upon them. But you have to admit Nioh has taken quite a bit from the souls games such as all the things I listed in my last comment. Maybe  is a bit hyperbolic but its not far off.

10788678,0,t3_5ubcvn,One thing the alpha did that nothing after it including the full game did was have equipment durability. You hit the nail on the head on more enemies in the alpha. But while I DID appreciate the enhanced difficulty I also felt this was a very cheap and lousy way to produce it. This was what Dark Souls  Scholar of the First Sin did to compensate for how easy the original version of the game was. Artificially inflating its difficulty by just overwhelming you with more enemies particularly in choke points or spots that could trap you.Didnt care for this then and I now seeing how this game has changed Im glad they changed it here too. Thats not great game design and why Miyazaki doesnt like to rely on it in the other Soulsborne games. If you dont know he didnt do DSFor example what sounds more appealing from a difficulty standpoint to the average player? Having an overwhelming number of enemies in a choke point that effectively forces you to try to peel off only a few of them at a time and then forces you to retreat back further into the stage. Or having one or two badass tough enemies in a tight spot with less room to maneuver to fight them?See with the original way Nioh worked youd have a constant rubber banding effect going on. Youd take  steps pull two or more enemies and then have to retreat  steps to find somewhere suitable to break them apart or hope one lost aggro. And then youd repeat this over and over again until you finished the stage.Quite frankly it was exhausting and while I dont think it was terrible design it would have gotten REALLY old to do that in every stage. Ill admit the sense of accomplishment of coming out of a scrape against  enemies was exciting but it just overall wasnt worth the repetition in my opinion.I still see plenty of folks struggling with the final product and if the number of revenants I wade through is any indication there are plenty more even. The game is a little easier for me than it may be for some but Ive also been a Souls veteran since Demons Souls released in the US. So in that regard DS was pretty damn easy to me as well.Overall though Im pretty happy with the final products difficulty level its a nice fine balance. And I no longer feel like Im regularly doing the rubber banding effect to progress through a mission. That said I wouldnt have minded the difficulty being upped a bit by having some of the enemies do more damage. Especially in the earlier portion of the game. For example the armored trained human enemies doing more damage than the pirates who just swing wildly. And most especially the Yokai doing more.,Nioh,ddsrx95,3,t5_39y47

10794429,0,t3_5ucjdf,Yeah not having played a souls game before is probably both good and bad. Players who are deep into souls tend to ignore the two most important aspects of this game  utilizing the Ki pulse and switching between stances even during fights. Keep practicing this and the game is much easier than any souls game.

10812816,0,t1_ddv2ls3,I am actually unsure how scaling works. My A scaling spirit weapon actually deals less damage if I put  into it than if I put  into body instead katana which is B scaling IIRC. That makes no sense so hopefully someone can explain that.But yes it adds another multiplier on for scaling. Katanas dont have spirit scaling so it just adds it its either broken for the aforementioned reason or theres something else happening. ,Nioh,ddv9kt1,1,t5_39y47

10827747,0,t3_5utvhq,I dont agree with flatlining stats across the board even when leveling up. Weapon scaling has no limits as far as capping so if your main damage of your weapon comes from strength for example all weapons scale with  stats but  is usually higher than the others you want to raise strength the highest so your damage comes the highest. Also with the cap essentially being   in all stats their will be little build variety. but most people I imagine are still under lv  or so. So there is build variety in those levels since you have fewer stats. Putting  may seem stupid if your coming from souls but its essentially the best damage you can do along with getting change attack to main stat as a modifier on your weapon. So the main goal people should reach for is  in main stat and  in spirit for spirit bonuses depending on your chosen neopet then pump the others how you see fit as you level up further. ,Nioh,ddwt0fa,1,t5_39y47

10854914,0,t3_5v6hyq, Your item box represents all of the weapons and armor youre currently carrying on your person.   You have  options to deal with this. Sell your excess gear to the blacksmith for Gold. Disassemble your excess gear for crafting materials used in Forging Offer your your excess equipment to the Shrine for free elixirs and other consumables.I personally like the last option since donating a few hundred items at a time will get you abour  Elixirs among other things like antidotes and antiparalytic needles. The most painfree way of doing this is to arrange your list by Rarity. Go to the bottom of your list and hold Triangle then just hold up to rapidly tag all your low grade gear.  I personally tag everything blue and below.   This works in all three menus.  Any items you dont want to get rid of use square to lock that item..  Glory is used for a shop that opens later in the game called the Hidden Teahouse.  . There is a rare finds area of the blacksmith shop but no.  Most people tend to just beat up on bosses and revenants to get better gear.. Im not  here but I THINK it means that skills IE Guard  Square to deliver a kick with the Kusarigama do greater Ki damage  has a greater chance to guardbreak opponents..

For example a katana with A spirit will still get more points from the innate B heart. It just is a bonus.You can also stack them. So if you have A heart roll on a katana it will scale twice from heart.As far as elemental damage they dont get scaled up when rolled on a weapon.

11077626,1,t3_5y6vsb,Axes are easily the worst weapon type in the game. Even with an investment into Strength their DPS never gets close to that of any of the other weapon types.

Do something because of your own desire and for the most part you wont regret it.I really enjoyed Nioh but towards the latter half of the game I started getting a Ok I just want to get through this mentality. As opposed to FromSoft games I was patient and never got that feeling. I was always curious and hesitant as to what comes next. Not so with Nioh. Whether thats the story limited enemy types linear missionbased game direction or something else altogether I started getting impatient and just wanted to get it over with just to finish it. Though Niohs systems are more complex than DS and BB it can be overwhelming. Bloodborne being the simplest and least diverse in terms of character builds I really liked it and that allowed me to focus more on the environment story and overall game brilliance. Ive never gotten the same feelings in Nioh as I had in DS or BB and this may have been why Nioh doesnt stand up to those titles for me personally.,Nioh,detvw6u,3,t5_39y47

It didnt stop them from nerfing a bunch of stuff heavily when they realized people were finding creative ways to benefit from the game mechanics. It shouldnt stop them from adding a little safety factor here and there to prevent their customers from losing hundreds of hours of gameplay. When the game was unexpectedly corrupting saves when creating new characters it wasnt a something to celebrate and use outofgame file management to deal with.

Once thats done and you can fight him on solid ground hes a lot more manageable albeit still annoying due to wonky hitboxes it really bugs me that his mandible attack seems to have a constant active hitbox as long as hes on the ground and his weird rotation movement when hes rearing up.

11610338,0,t1_dg8rfq9,Nioh is the first game in the potential series though unlike bloodborne that already has  games before it was made. Combat wise Nioh in my opinion is far superior to any game in the soulsborne series. It may have  weapons but the skills tree makes your weapon techniques highly customisable. Did you slog through the game without investing any real interest in it? All weapons in bloodborne are one trick ponies. You cannot customize movesets to your specification. Youll be stuck with a specific weapon and thats it. Because if you have prejudices or initial judgments then it will really destroy any interest you have due to bias. But I digress it is still your perspective and your choice whether to like a game or not. That is your opinion and this is my opinion. Its for the OP to decide for themselves to try this game out rather than relying on other peoples opinions in making decisions. Who knows? They may like the game or not.

Learned that when hes going to run full screen and tigerstrike me to just run away across the screen and hell get tired usually.  Never fight in the middle of the stage so you have a lot of room to run.  When out of ki hit him so he falls final blow then stronghighstance attack again for a little extra.  When he spins his sword around and youre close enough hit him or take cover by the rock.  Bait out his flurry attack or jumping attacks.
