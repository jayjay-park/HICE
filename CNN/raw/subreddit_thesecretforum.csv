1635213,0,t1_cjl0jto,I thought so as well but now that Im a mod I can look at Sides activity.  Yesterday he sent out about  invites and about eight hours ago he sent out another .This tells me that while he does appear to be choosing people from random subs he is picking whom to invite and not just sending out invites to everyone.  Also the dramatic change in the number of invites sent tells me that hes wanting a target number of people in here and not simply as many as he can get.This is all speculation of course but I can tell you that hes not a bot.,thesecretforum,cjla7xy,2,t5_32y39
