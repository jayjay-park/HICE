851569,0,t3_23vcla,Heres the problem  printers and the market have all started to treat production like a commodity.  Quit doing that and if you are doing that  quit competing that way.  Do something unique and master it.  People will line up to buy it. The industry seems hellbent on selling you things that will jump your business from the commodity market to a different market.  Guess what though?  There are already companies in those different markets that are REALLY good at doing that thing  and you dragging your commodity business with it is not going to help.The best example that I can think of is that a local printer started doing digital  stuff WAY before any other printer was even considering it.  He built up his sales department and they were good at exactly what they were producing....  eventually he realized that the print part of the business wasnt even necessary.  There were too many other printers in town trying to do the exact same thing but they werent any good at it and didnt understand it and couldnt sell it.  So he sold his print division and farmed it all out as a commodity and is making tons.Is that the guy you want to compete against?  Hes rounding rd base and you havent even figured out where st base is.  Same goes with marketing services provider or multimedium ad specialist or integrated campaign experts.  These are all industries that print providers and the industry that serves them are trying to compete in but were just too late and from my perspective not any good at being those businesses.  I dont have a fancy office in the warehouse district  Ive got this old print shop in the industrial part of town with ink on our fingers.So what do I do?  I master my craft I expand into other areas that my customers are buying elsewhere large format letterpress mail online? I reduce my expenses and I position myself to not just be a commodity to them but a resource to them.  I demonstrate the impact of print through my marketing.  I do creative things.  I bring people through the door that might not know exactly what they want  but they know that theyd like to buy it from me.Do that and you can ignore this racket at all the conventions about evolving.,CommercialPrinting,ch12tmn,3,t5_2vg80

6018442,0,t1_cy8gdi4,Honestly theres not many people doing much with varnish in the digital world but mostly because operators dont know how to use it effectively. I installed my varnish option because the manufacturer wouldnt support it. My first bottle of ink had a giant BETA watermark on it. Its worked well for my purposes I just wish I could get my designer clients to think outside of the box a little bit.,CommercialPrinting,cy8jkgn,1,t5_2vg80

7265543,0,t1_d24052w,Adobe pushed back a bit but ultimately has no say in hexachrome. Artwork would be done in the LAB colorspace and the RIPplatemaker converts and spits out  plates.Its certainly not very common anymore but its a good solution for wide gamut printing.,CommercialPrinting,d241hmf,1,t5_2vg80
8283251,0,t1_d5cpjox,Ah theyre likely not using it long enough to even notice if it does have failure problems anyway.  Love when customers know best until you explain to them that every print shop has their own house stock and they always put you in it and tell you its the best. ,CommercialPrinting,d5cyrx1,1,t5_2vg80

8649924,0,t1_d6mt1ej,thank you for your rant. I agree there are many other types of printing. I was just posting an article that I thought you may like. Thank you for being the typical Redditor and looking down your nose at a good article because it does not meet your extra long definition. i have  departments that dose may types of printing but i thought this article was a good example of why the classic tactical marketing is still effective.  ,CommercialPrinting,d6muq2y,1,t5_2vg80

9635739,0,t1_da0roqo,This is for large quantities as my client would be producing a new card game. So this wouldnt work for them but I am curious as to what you mean by hand applying an imprint? Do you mean applying the ink to a premade stamp and just using that to press against the card in place of selective coating? ,CommercialPrinting,da0sy3x,1,t5_2vg80
9778175,0,t1_dago1cx,Thanks for the indepth overlook.  The plates arewill be used on Heidelberg GTOs and SMs and weve been using metal plates forever.  Most often we do small batches because even with big batches canning labels there are variations that clients would ask for. I think the quality of whichever we choose should be similar since we dont really work down to the microns.  I understand there are now processless method for both thermal and UV. From cost long and shortterm overall standpoint which do you think is better? Thanks.  ,CommercialPrinting,daidj0q,1,t5_2vg80
9792917,0,t3_5fe5xo,Here is my idea that I would look into if possible. See if you can locate anyone with a  foot wide pen plotter that could see if there was a possibility of using a stick of chalk as the pen and use black poster paper. Most vector drawings can be turned into plots. Dont know if that is an option but at least gives you another idea. ,CommercialPrinting,dak6tug,1,t5_2vg80
9932091,0,t1_db0rlmb,Thats interesting. I looked into the new Cs and it looks like the C can do transparent toner. I am guessing that is like spot gloss? Do you have any experience with this machine?,CommercialPrinting,db26d4x,1,t5_2vg80
9953468,0,t1_db4rti0,Just search for wide format print shop in google maps. There will probably be more than one in your town avoid staplesoffice depot adds. Ask to buy two if it lowers the cost they will probably have a good bit of waste with just one and might charge for it,CommercialPrinting,db4yncr,2,t5_2vg80
10310736,0,t1_dccoawo,My company deals solely with brokers. Any time there is a trade show you can attend you should have a booth setup with high quality samples and perhaps coupons also. We do numbering in house as well sometimes on a letterpress sometimes digitally as the form prints. We got a Xerox Nuvera  black digital press around August or so and I love the thing. Its very close to the speed and price per impression that our offset presses do plus no plates faster setup and no washing up. ,CommercialPrinting,dccs0nl,2,t5_2vg80
