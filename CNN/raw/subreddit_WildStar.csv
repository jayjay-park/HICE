58477,0,t1_cel2wk9,I prefer quest that are more like this.... warning lots of text You find a book in town with a quest marker on it?. The book tells you of a hidden workshop in the town used to turns a special elemental ore into powerful items with resistance to magic. scribbled in the margin you see the words near the anvil hides a door as a hint. You head to the blacksmith hes the only one with an anvil and notice you can gear the wall you gear the wall and it turns out you need a key. You character then notices an oddly key shaped lump in the spine of the book and use the knife which was conveniently laying on a table in the blacksmith to cut open the book receive the workshop key. After entering the workshop you find another booknext to a skeleton. with a quest marker above it?. The book tells you that the workshop is broken and how to fix it... It also says that the skeleton was an adventurer who was beaten to death by an earth elemental after trying to take some of the ore in the nearby cavern needed to craft the elemental bar. The book says firstly that you need to get the water running in order to turn on the wheel for the furnace. After some gearing of valves mini puzzle you manage to turn the water on. Nearby water elementals will attack you after a failed attempt to turn it on The next thing the book says is that the bellows are badly damaged and need repair. It also says nearby crates should have the item neded. You notice a lava trough near the furnace. Thirdly the book states the proper mining and smelting techniques of the elemental ore... but not where to get the ore. You suddenly remember the first part of the book the elementals guard the ore in a nearby cavern. You head to the cavern and realize that you dont have mining. You swing your sword at the oversized node in frustration and it turns out that it was really a sleeping elemental... Who is now pissed. Or gear a lump of ore attached to a oddly shaped rock You kill the elemental and receive the special elemental ore. You remember the part of the book about the smelting techniques but... Theres nothing to start a fire in the furnace with... except for the lava in the trough near the furnace... The dead adventure who wrote the book suspects the stone bowls near the lava trough may work. You use the bowl on the trough next to the furnace and a fire elemental spawns which you swiftly kill. You then use the bowl of lava on the furnace then the elemental ore on the furnace and feed the furnace coal as its smelting to keep it at the right temp minigame! You finally receive the perfectly smelted bar! Yay! You take the bar to the special anvil in the middle of the workshop and because everything is in working order again the mechanisms it crafts a special magic resist shield for you... And then breaks completely as a lead in for the next quest. Quest Complete! The shield is the reward and maybe a pile of gold when you tell the NPC who is in charge of the town. Note During the quests you are flipping threw the book its not leading you threw the quest but the pages would be layed out so the info you need is on page one then two then three etc...This is just one example I could probably come up with a hundred or so if I wanted to.,WildStar,cel36rj,1,t5_2sqwc

112225,1,t3_1vdo80,The people that are involved in key selling or buying arent the ones to foster any community Reddit or otherwise .In my opinion the following needs to happen. Tie codes to emails. If the email address that received the key isnt the one on the account redeeming the key tough luck.. Stop sending friend keys. Give different people a chance instead of ones from the same clique.. Keys need to expire after say a week or so. Another random person gets chosen per key expired.. Give keys to a centralized community like Reddit via the subreddit mods to give away to members.,WildStar,cer7jua,2,t5_2sqwc
113101,0,t1_cer7jua,To put a finer point on what others have said  is an objectively bad idea.Carbine and any game developer is most interested in handing out beta keys to people that are going to log lots of game hours. At the macro level they dont have many efficient ways to sort through their beta applicants and omnisciently select the testers that are going to play most frequently. An example of a modest procedure that gets at this problem is the beta survey which one can presume decreases  though doesnt eliminate  the pool of bad testers ie testers that wouldnt log time. A more effective perhaps the most effective method to make sure you have great testers is to give existing great testers ie people that log every Saturday the opportunity to distribute a limited number of keys. I can assure you from personal experience the principal criterion that those testers lucky enough to get friend keys apply when deciding which of their friends to invite is Who is going to play this game with me. Friend keys become a great proxy procedure to make sure good testers get access. That isnt to say Redditors would be bad testers. But at the macro level the friend key program is just a more elegant effective and scalable procedure.,WildStar,cerb4sa,2,t5_2sqwc

132196,0,t3_1vla4t,Personally I like the layered content but heres my reason whyLets say you pick up an Episode quest storyline and a couple Tasks generic.  You start off on your way starting with  quests and then stumble across a Soldier holdout.  You can choose to do the holdout first or continue down the Episode quest.  Lets say you opt for the Soldier holdout but then you continue back on the path to the Episode quest.  Along the way you double jump into a butterfly and unlock a challenge... of course you have to get gold so you run around in a wider area trying to catch as many as possible.Before you know it you are off the beaten path and see another quest giver cowering by a rock.  He wants you to explore a nearby cave and recover his tools.  The cave is right there so you say why not... and dive in.  Towards the back of the cave there is a hidden portion that an Explorer has unlocked allowing you to go deeper into the cave and you help the Explorer kill a miniboss.  You emerge from all of this and refocus on the Episode quest.This would be a positive experience for me because its all about Player Choice.  Along the journey of one quest path I was presented with little teasers of additional content that I could CHOOSE to consume.  Personally I would probably choose most of them.What I would say is that IMHO Episode quests need to be modified a bit to make that choice a bit harder to make.  Even when watching streamers its difficult to figure out which quests are storylineEpisodes.  This is mostly a UI issue I believe but without the compelling presence of AN EPISODE QUEST vs an episode quest I feel that players wont be presented with a tough enough choice.TLDR  IMHO improving the distinction between tasks and EPISODES will improve game play and further support player choice.,WildStar,cethixj,4,t5_2sqwc

170335,1,t1_cextcw3,This is actually a good point. The more generalized you make content the less unique that content becomes. Lets say for example a raid could be between  and  players and it would automatically scale between the two. In theory it sounds good people who cant organize man groups can still do the raid with . However in execution everyone who would be doing this raid would do it as a man because it is easier to coordinate and even if it was as difficult with  people as with  it would be easier to clear because you could just form a really strong consistent man forming a really strong consistent man is nearly impossible.Despite modern game design theories letting players do whatever they want however they want is not a good thing. We play games in order to be placed under restrictions. If a game had no rules it would not be a game. The best player is the one that does the best under the rules not one who is limited by the rules. If this means people grumble about man raid content thats fine at least youre keeping man raid content unique and under explicit limitations. At the end of the day getting that legendary blessed blade of the wind...breaker or whatever means something and it means something a lot bigger than if it dropped from a man dungeon or a man man man etc.I dont know if Im going to raid in Wildstar. It depends on whether I can find a guild that needs me to tank for them thats big enough to do mans and that has decent people. But I still believe man raids are a good idea. They give us something to work for whether that be by recruiting more guild members getting more geared or just being more coordinated.,WildStar,cexu1b5,0,t5_2sqwc

186192,0,t1_cezl7hf,I think you are right which is just depressing. I personally think the current structure of WoW is absurd. The quests dont feel like quests they feel like chores with little to no interest or importance  a virtual version of cleaning out a cats litterbox. Whats more when they do that I wonder what the point of quests even is. The whole leveling process feels like a hazing ritual that you have to go through to be a max level character  not exactly entertainment ...Some would argue that quests teach you how to play but sadly in the current state of WoW you can mash  buttons on any character in greensquest blues and kill any mob due to power creep. I know the NDA currently only allows people to show levels  but watching people  shot mobs is definitely disheartening.

If I had to guess beta waves are determined by a couple departments.  Server people say how many they can handle and then the community team sends out some keys.

323704,0,t3_1xsvda,As lame as it is for those like you whove been signed up for years its actually probably smarter from a marketing perspective to reward those who are jumping onto the bandwagon now. As far as Carbine are concerned people like you are probably a safe bet to buy and play the game come release given the time youve invested into following it and how much you now already know about anticipate it. I wouldnt be so quick to label all newcomers as just greedy ebayers trying to cash in on others want to play the game. Sure there are some of these people but most of the recent flood of applicants to giveaways are almost certainly a result of the game growing in size and word of mouth spreading. Going from simply personal experience I only really started following this game properly about  months ago but already feel fully involved in the great beta key hunt and cant wait to play the game in closed beta open beta or just release.  Considering theres probably mil scrabbling to get into the beta the fact that for example about  jumped on Ashrals twitch stream last night for the giveaway is not surprising and is still fairly good odds of getting a key compared to the Monday waves. When you want something its always annoying when others get it but you dont but sadly with things like game testing advertising its not simply a first come first serve as there are many other factors involved including blind luck of course and only Carbine have real power to choose who how many get in. My advice as infuriating as it might sound is have patience and hope that you get into the beta before release  if you dont then feel happy knowing youll get to play an even more polished game and still have fun!  Sorry for ridiculously long rant but I can see the hype for this game tipping slightly into anger for some people which is crazy. So sit back relax and spam the living hell out of rsharewildstar all day like everyone else does! D  TLDR  Life is a series of random events and consequences affected somewhat by personal desire and influential external factors. The Wildstar release is almost inevitable and you will get to play it but sadly you cannot have absolute control over when you play it. The sooner everyone realises this the better. P.S for someone whod only briefly dropped in in the past Ashrals stream was really entertaining and informative last night. Sadly Im EU so couldnt watch the whole thing but the fact hes giving away keys too is just a nice bonus  the guy knows his shiz. P.P.S considering around  people get keys every week the fact that there is currently only a single key for sale on ebay.co.uk shows that this idea that everyone who gets a key in giveaways is probably just a bot wholl sell it is probably incorrect.,WildStar,cfebme4,20,t5_2sqwc

473773,0,t3_1zj0bd,I think theres alot of people who used to play World of Warcraft who would actually like to get into an mmo again but have found thenselves disappointed in other available options. Now this is purely my own opinion but wildstar seems to be the first mmo to be released recently that has the same appeal that wow used to. With things like Rift Tera ESO and a whole host of other mmos that have tried to take down WoW they all have the same hyper realistic art style. Whereas wildstar is going with the WoW cartoony style which appeals to those exWoWers who want to get into mmo gaming again.One HUGE thing that wildstar is being so successful with is the content theyre releasing as part of game development. Wildstar flicks dev speaks these are ingenious ways of showing what the game is all about but at the same time not revealing a huge amount about the game so people remain curious. Think of it like a movie trailer some give away tons of the plot or show the best jokes so when youre watching the film theres nothing to surprise you. Whereas Im sure carbine still have plenty of tricks up their sleeve which will all be revealed when the game is finally released. TLDR  Wildstar is awesome.EDIT Id also like to say I share somewhat the same opinion you have but applied to ESO. I played the beta this weekend and it juat doesnt feel right to me. Im a little biased because obviously im rooting for Wildstar  and I also cant stand skyrim. But the firat tutorial just felt like a series of corridors with nothing really happening except scripted events.,WildStar,cfu4cml,15,t5_2sqwc

479848,0,t1_cfuprvb,gt Wow had a lot of broken things and the skills trees were so unbalanced it makes me wonder if you were actually there in  lol.Whats it called when you attack the person giving the argument instead of the argument itself? Yeah.Whether or not I was there is irrelevant to the discussion. The history speaks for itself. Regardless of its initial faults when you compare WoW as a game to its notable competition around the time of its debut Dark Age of Camelot Asherons Call  amp  Star Wars Galaxies Everquest Lineage II City of Heroes and Guild Wars its hard to deny that WoW was superior to every single one of them in every way. This is not to say those other games were bad or invalid at all. I played all of them at one point or another CoH remains my favorite to this day but theres no question that WoW was the best of the bunch. It was more polished better looking had more gameplay options tons of content. You name it WoW had it.This is not the case with Wildstar. While a good game its not the best at everything it does. But it needs to be to attract and retain the audience its going for. Even if its better than WoW overall whats the incentive to get a player to leave years worth of accumulated game time and rewards when a brand new expansion is looming on the horizon?gt But seriously the main advantage it had was time to fix and polish everything up and became everything you stated but it was far from there out of box.gt If wildstar or any MMO had two solid years of major subs to release new content and polish the old that game would have a chance to flourish too.None of this matters to whether or not Wildstar will be a success at release. You have to play the hand youve been dealt. As you mentioned WoW was the right MMO at the right time and Blizzard capitalized. There was nothing stopping Carbine from reviewing the data looking at history of its predecessors and also capitalizing on the opportunities laid out before it. But as I explained in an earlier post they did not do this. In the end they made a good game when they could have made a great game.And for the record.. My roommate at the time was invited to participate in the closed beta for vanilla which is where I first experienced the game. I bought the game on December  .

529294,0,t1_cfzvv5w,Its not too bad in Wildstar. In games like WoW you had a base  second CC that had  tiers of dimishing returns so a single player could keep another player locked down for a full    seconds using a single family of CC. Wildstar requires much more coordinated effort to truly lock down a target as you need to couple several CCs i.e. root  knockdown to truly prevent your opponent from reacting and that generally means multiple players have to coordinate a simultaneous setup. On top of that several classes have very short cooldown CC breaks or excellent access to Interrupt Armor making them very difficult to lock down. For instance Engineers have a full CC break on a  second cooldown. Warriors similarly have a full CC break on a  second cooldown but it also grants them several seconds of complete CC immunity through the freedom effect.,WildStar,cg0frn1,1,t5_2sqwc

532815,0,t1_cg0tzni,gtSome of us are too old but most of us have found Wildstar to be extremely boring. This doesnt mean a new generation of people whore the age I was when I got into vanilla WoW wont enjoy Wildstar and make it a leading game but it does mean a lot of people are very disappointed Wildstar isnt going to be the savior some of us expected.Thats exactly it too. Or rather thats what I poorly conveyed when I said they hate it because its an MMO. A lot of people especially the loud vocal ones it seems are burnt out on any MMO because theyve played them for so long. I hope I dont sound like an ass but the whole Wildstar will be the savior of MMOs! never made sense to me for the exact reason I said that I think it will be a solid choice because its a WoW clone. As shiny and well made as it is nothing remotely resembling WoW is going to save the MMO market in my personal opinion. Even then the phrase confuses me too the MMO market isnt dying its just oversaturated. Like I even said WoW alone has millions of people playing and thats not even counting all the other bigger name MMOs let alone the multitude of tiny shitty ones.Edit to add on to the above even just being a savior of an MMO to an individual person rather than the entire genre never made sense for the same exact reason WoW clone however well made is still heavily based off WoW and if theyve been playing a lot of WoW and are bored of it Wildstar most likely wouldnt be holding their attention for more than a few months anyways.I think it just all comes down from my experience to a lot of people just being burnt out on MMOs and trying to find other reasons as to why such as the game being terrible the genre dying etc etc when its just that theyve burnt themselves out after several years of playing WoW or other MMOs or just never being a huge fan of them in the first place. Hell I only played GW for like  months or so before I burnt out on that but prior to that Id played WoW since almost release with a few months of breaks every now and then I know Ive burnt myself out on MMOs for a long time but I also know Wildstar will at least give me a few months of enjoyment at least.Anyways hope my rant didnt sound hostile or anything like that.  lt,WildStar,cg0u6fh,-2,t5_2sqwc

540360,0,t1_cg1ot1o,The reason for this is because there is no point in optimizing something that is still volatile and subject to large changes. Optimizing is usually a late step in the process. If they optimized as they went it would slow the process down and result in having to go back and change old changes each time something that affected optimization was modified.I feel like Carbine has been very clear on the whole optimization subject whether or not you feel like it should be a chronological priority in the development cycle. Also if youre getting  fps on that kind of pc then you probably didnt do any of the easy tricks on the beta forums.

547831,0,t1_cg2jbuy,The k figure is an absolute maximum its normal non crit heal is around sub k surged with my current stats.  Youre going to get some crits on some people but again its a use of surge that you are going to want to use on other things you may reasonably get one cast of it in your aoe healing cycle and non surged sustain is very slow and much lower than even that.  average to k average on crit. Yeah I mean its not bad. But its not great for anything other than raids I just wish it had more utility for most content rather than being so situationally good.I guarantee itll be changed in the near future even further. Its a dodgy spell. Medics can deliver much greater hps consistently on a group than Spellslingers can if sustain is supposed to be a burst heal for groups that is non directional then make it good at its job. Its the biggest hole in the Spellslinger healing arsenal IMO. ,WildStar,cg2jmfl,1,t5_2sqwc

549653,0,t3_20fd4f,The game is exactly opposite of WoW it is impossible to compare. Not even from a a general perspective. I say this because Wildstar mantra is something for everyone. In WoW its one person can do everything. Therefore WoW is simplified and dumbified until any sense of epic achievement for the player is wiped out. In Wildstar a player is not suppose to complete everything because they want to preserve a sense of epic achievement via  man raids or special status pvp im guessing on pvp though I dont care for it much adventures etc. I hope they continue with this direction i.e. sense of epic achievement.

555929,0,t1_cg3f8og,I prefer raw numbers as opposed to analysis from some random YouTuber. WoW hit its subscriber peak in  WotLK came out in November . The first drop was late  and Cataclysm came out in December . gtWhen WotLK released the growth of the game dropped dramaticallyGrowth is growth. Your argument was that super ultra hardmode  man raiding thats a second job gave something players to strive for... it was an incentive for subscribers if that was the case then subscriptions would have fallen earlier because the game became dramatically easier with WotLK. Slower growth? Sure but the game had become an old hat by that point and everyone was tired of Blizzards handling of PvP and balancing. I loved logging in after patch day seeing my character being completely useless only to have them OP in the next patch. gtBecause Im not sure what you disagree with me on.

583125,0,t1_ceuzi6b,I agree with you.  dungeons may not be enough especially when in my opinion the instanced PvE is this games best feature. I played to level  on beta and tried almost everything end game has to offer and I will tell you it IS a little boring. There really isnt THAT much to do. You run the same  dungeons youve ran already just on veteran mode and you get  new dungeon. You pretty much spam those until you are geared enough for raiding. Half the dungeons arent that big either. Stormtalon Lair and Ruins of Kel Vorath only have  bosses.  Or you can PvP. There is only  different BGs btw and  arena that I know of. I really feel if they would have capitalized on how good their dungeons were and added more the game would be so much better at least from a PvE point of view. Leveling feels like there is too many gaps  between unlocking new content you can do. You get  dungeons at level . Then you have to level up all the way to  to get access to another dungeon. After that you have to hit max level to unlock the final dungeon. Then you get to run them all over again! I mean sure there is adventures but honestly they just feel like lazy dungeons. They are very easy and boring for the most part at least in my opinion.,WildStar,cg6k0dv,1,t5_2sqwc

641347,0,t1_cgd1olg,Difficulty goes up and down one thing to remember is there are still massive gear and class changes happening from build to build so raid DPS is all over the place.Some fights like X become much easier with higher group DPS because you dont need to be so careful with where you place grounddestroying mechanics. When we first ran this at fresh  in terrible gear and suboptimal damage specs we were running out of platforms before we killed him. At which point we had to do a lot of planning in terms of how we moved the boss where we faced him to destroy specific platforms and where people with lazers on them needed to run to.If you go in there now with runes and optimal gear you can blow it up before the mechanics really come into play which trivializes the fight.

Im just hoping that these artifacts are almost unobtainable and EXTREMELY difficult to get so we only have a small amount of people with them. Lets be honest... legendaries in WoW really arent hard to get. They just take a little bit of time hence if theres a patch with a legendary item pretty much every raid group thats cleared normal content has a player or several with sed legendary item. And they become less special. I want legendaries that are INSSSSSSAAANE to have. I miss that feeling in some MMOs seeing someone with this near unobtainable gear and just wanting to look at him.

GHz i processor and the GT M i.e. the laptop version which is even worse than the desktop one youve got.I get  fps on the character selection screen  fps in the Dominion starter zone slightly less in the Exile one and about the same in Thayd. In my housing plot I get  outdoors and  inside.I was getting worse frame rates than that before so I set all the ingame graphics settings as low as they can be and updated my graphics driver which helped a bit though mine was a year out of date so....Following someones advice under the Compatibility tab I also set it to run in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP which forces it to use the bit version instead of bit. Itll download the necessary files the next time you run the launcher. After that I did rightclick gt Properties on my WildStar shortcut and put dx on the end of the Target box so it says CProgram Files xNCSOFTWildStarWildstar.exe dx.Both of those gave me framerate improvements but apparently results vary  for some people its made it worse.

I dont think its fair to say Hutball shouldnt be in wildstar because SWTOR wasnt a success. Yes the games launched was botched by EA big surprise? but their PvPskill design was pretty amazing.

878735,0,t1_ch41ffo,gtIve heard the exiles eventually start getting more morally ambiguous rather than being definitively good guysSee I wanted there to be ambiguity on each side so Im glad the exiles arent just one dimensional Oh no were getting our things fucked up by the big bad dominion again the entire time. And Ive heard it evens out with that and then with the Dominion not seeming so evil later but it just seemed odd to me how over the top evil the first few minutes of play made the Dominion seem.For an example of what I mean take WoW. I dont know enough of the lore to comment on how deep it is throughout the game but in the start for most of the Horde races it talks about how theyre trying to rebuild after war or are being raided by Alliance races or so. Theyre a bunch of orcs and other monsters the bad guys of the story but from their point of view theyre just trying to get along.,WildStar,ch45z51,2,t5_2sqwc

879078,0,t1_ch45xek,WildStars questing is your typical hub jumper. You have a bunch of quests in this group grab them all run out kill collect talk run back. Do a couple more in that area and a path quest here or there along the way but its all very point A to point B to point C. Its very traditional MMORPG quest hub jumping. Same thing was done in EQ and WoW. Im not saying its bad Im just saying that its not very innovative by any means and it feels like a grind after a couple hours. However with ESO because you spend a lot of time exploring for quests and listening to all the voice overs you can spend more time without it feeling like a grind.             I do appreciate the Simon Says game mechanics and the hacking of terminals I found that to add a little something extra which I appreciated. Hell I still remember one where it was  or  colours for the last one. That was hard as hell haha.          The one thing I love about ESO is that depending on what you do in the game the people in the town refer to you when walking by them. It makes the city feel more alive than just same voice saying the same thing over and over. I remember in EQ there was this kid in Qeynos Harbor I think it was and every time you ran past him he would say I wanna be an adventurer when I grow up. However in ESO people in the town will be like did you hear that they killed a werewolf or thats the hero who saved the king etc and it changes as you progress throughout the game. I find that ESO makes you want to spend more time checking things out and WildStar will be very Get me to .            I however appreciate both games and have played both games a significant amount. I will only be subbing to WildStar as it has open world pvp and better dungeons and raiding. I can appreciate the traditional raiding feel. ,WildStar,ch47dp5,2,t5_2sqwc

If you pug people from advice chat then get together on a mumble vent or teamspeak I can see it happening after a few attempts. The time frame is very easy to hit with decent gear and a solid group.A few challenges you have to complete for a STL gold run First boss all the lightning bolts have to hit a enemy target in the nd phase not impossible to do without communication but hard. nd boss you have  to complete NO ONE can get hit by a tornado at any point in the encounter. And you have to kill adds that are immune to taunt within  seconds so this one really comes down to the tank and DPS. While your doing all of this no one can die at all during the entire run.WS can be grindy but a more skilled player will have to grindless than a less skilled player.

909041,0,t1_ch5xvmx,I agree with you asdj having a more local server at least one closer than Dallas makes solid business sense.When you look at total population Oceana has  mil give or take compared to the US with  million or so so its roughly  of the possible player base No Im not stating that all  or  million will play but assuming the same percentage of people play in either country its more or less safe to assume that the overall player percentages will be the same.Now when you factor in other close countries to Australia lets say Papua New Guinea  mil Indonesia  mil Phillippines  mil Singapore  mil and Malaysia  mil you are looking at a total of  million people including the traditional Oceana region vs  million in the US.Basically thats a lot of potential earnings while the expense etc may not be justified placing servers in Australia it would be worth placing a lot of them in say Phillippines or Indonesia where the costs would be substantially cheaper especially if you want your game to eventually expand into the bigger Asian markets such as China Korea Japan etc.If an Oceana labelled servers were actually located there Still appearing on the US server listing though it would reduce ping greatly and they would also have the setup for a future market from very large and probably neglected local player base Indo and Phillippines mainly.In any case its not like Carbine can actually do anything because server locations etc are determined by NC Soft but it is nice to dream about being on a server with decent ping..,WildStar,ch7m3n5,1,t5_2sqwc

You can easily grab a pillar to channel the  second cast and have your teammates kite or CC the other team whenever you need to use Gather Focus. If matches are lasting  minutes I wouldnt be too terribly concerned about losing one or more of your players in a  second window especially if its a coordinated retreat. And even if youre under constant pressure Healing Salve should help offset the damage while youre waiting out the healing debuff and Healing Torrent will still restore ludicrous amounts of health.  We shall see though. I havent laid eyes on a Spellslinger healer in arenas in months certainly not since the last patch.

It does amazing for Wildstar.With all settings maxed draw distance at max I get a solid fps in the open World. In PvP I was getting an average of  FPS in all the skirmishes. Also tanked the first dungeon at level  and got FPS. Every now and then in the open world I will get a random FPS spike for about a second but Im chopping it up to optimization issues that people seem to be having. I personally have had none beside the occasional FPS drop which would probably happen once per couple hours. If your considering go for an SSD.

I had the impression that the game was incredibly lacklustre until reaching roughly level  where a bugged quest chain forced me to progress into a higher level  mobs quest region and I saw the light when mobs actually started becoming a bit of a threat. My suggestion? Take the optional start zones presented at the end of the tutorial and retool them into advanced start zones. Let veteran players have a bit of a challenge in these areas and accelerate the levelling process as a reward. Just my two cents.,WildStar,chdl9fx,17,t5_2sqwc

996588,0,t1_chhi2r8,Its quite possible youll be able to names repeated on separate servers in beta they had names as JunahCgAlistar so the server simply becomes part of your name.  However since they didnt know the server list they made reservation global.   Once the name unlocks were not sure yet but it seems likely that it will free up on other servers.Thats why people are complaining that launch naming is very unfair people who start their char  weeks in may not have to deal with the global locks.If the names do end up being global then its more of a moot issue but.. why have Global names across NA and EU servers? unless they intend crossregion play and either way its a bit flawed.,WildStar,chhkidj,2,t5_2sqwc

996739,0,t3_25h8rm,OK here is my suggestion for the problemWipe the names and only do the name reservation thing for guilds.The best solution for character names is simply at character creation. The main problem here is that the people will be stressed out at the character creation because they want to secure the name ASAP. I suggest that you can chose and save the name before the char creation itself. You just press create a new character then a small window pops up that tells you to chose a name and then you can save it. After that you come to the main creation and you can continue as usual.The only requirement for this solution is a stabile loginserver to make it fair for everyone.,WildStar,chhl4lo,0,t5_2sqwc

997426,0,t1_chhlv4t,You do realize if such a database exists how long it would take to query and pull correct? More likely there is x amount of databases one for server. One simple database is used during reserves and they are simply going to copy it into individual server DBs. During launch the servers are already going to be overloaded. Id rather the system didnt try to delete the names while people are in CC and logging into the game. Rather it makes sense to bring the system down while they go through the server lists and delete any character names with level value  so that the entire system doesnt run at the pace of a snail come launch.

I always thought in Vanilla WoW it was cool seeing one or two people with items like Thunderfury or Ashkandi. However in this day and age of instant gratification I feel like most people have grown accustomed to strict tiered content.Will each raid in Wildstar merely be a stepping stonegear check for the next raid? I feel like the current WoW raiding dynamic is a perfect example of what to avoid. After Seige of Orgrimmar came out specifically LFR I began to find that even doing its immediate predecessor Throne of Thunder was completely pointless except for achievement hunting. Epics have become so commonplace and easily attainable that everyone expects to start acquiring them immediately after level capping. For the hardcore players I think many of us miss the days of Vanilla WoW and Burning Crusade where you could go weeks or even monthsOk maybe too long running BRSScholo and then Heroics respectively without grabbing your first epic.Where will Wildstar reside along the spectrum of Uhh... effort and reward huh?? Where at one end you get instant epics through nohassle LFRs and at the other it takes weeks of gearing up in dungeons to prepare for your first raid.We Wildstar fans write long posts because we care.EDIT Oww my eyes,WildStar,chit579,1,t5_2sqwc

1021837,0,t1_chkfhv6,Yeah I recall leveling alts in Cata and it was a bit boring even with heirlooms and stuff.     The problem I have with the concept of handing out levels is that new players wouldnt have time to learn theyd be there in a dungeon going huh? half the time.      Yes leveling is easy in most other games but should it really be? Sure many vets just want to PvP or hit the raids right off the bat but only so many players do that a large percentage need to learn or just play casually to relax or whatever and leveling is very much a part of that.     At worst for the hardcore players a slower leveling rate just means a momentary inconvenience but for those not familiar with this games combat mechanics they get a chance to learn it takes time and needs to be paced properly or else it wont work and therell be a lot more players running around with no idea how to complete a dungeon. ,WildStar,chkfu4c,1,t5_2sqwc

1026626,0,t3_25ucxi,Its not true that any modern MMO does item swapping.  It may be that the games you have tried do but thats not enough data to make a broad claim on the genre.  I imagine the game would need to be designed with that type of feature in mind and were not privy to any thought processes that went into the development of the game.  Just because other games do this doesnt mean Carbine must do this.That being said if they do add this type of thing it seems to make sense for them to add gear sets with different limited action sets.  For all we know its in the list of things to do but will come later.  WoW didnt have gear management until much later after launch.  Its by no means a critical feature and again there may be some kind of balancing reason why they dont want this type of feature in the game for all we know.,WildStar,chkzf4g,1,t5_2sqwc

1037388,0,t1_chm6hp4,Its not a bad thing thats why I said its not a bad game. If I thought being a WoW clone was a bad thing Id hate every single game that isnt some action MMO like TERA or BampS. I hate on WoW because I hate what the games become since I started playing like  years ago not because its some hip thing to do. Even so being a clone isnt a bad thing it just means what I said it meansit just doesnt stand out enough to make me want to pay . a month for it. I agree with you on the graphics part WoW is beginning to look way too dated. When I said it had a similar style I meant it had the same overly colorful super cartoony look as WoW. Again not a bad thing just another thing that made it feel like a similar game. I mean its not Guild Wars s realistic look BampSs hyperstylish Korean look etc. As for XIV well. Youre pretty much the only person Ive ever heard say the game isnt a challenge at endgame.

1041204,1,t3_2606yp,Repeat of an old argument. Now heres the most concise counterargumentThis has been tried over and over again Tabula Rasa Star Trek Online Star Wars The Old Republic Age of Conan The Secret World others. And it turned out the same way each time. Each game was budgeted around the assumption that they would have at least half a million month subscribers. None of them got much above one fourth of that and all of them dropped off fast. That meant that they had to lay off developers which meant that content updates stopped happening regularly which meant even fewer subscribers.The marketing research has already been done. The hard way at the cost of about a billion dollars of wasted investment. There turns out to only be about  people world wide who a own a highend gaming PC and b are willing to pay a subscription fee for a game and c dont play World of Warcraft or EVE Online. Wildstar will probably attract all or most of those people and maybe even a few more than that for one month. It wont be enough.In the meantime both Guild Wars  and Runequest have proved that if you design your game from the beginning around low barrier to entry and low cost to subscribe and then advertise cosmetic and convenience upgrades at all price points from the most inexpensive to the most expensive you generate easily four to six times the revenue of the subscription model which is why neither studio has had to lay off people why both of them are still hiring and expanding.A year or two when NCsoft pulls the plug on Wildstar because its underperforming this will be the reason that the number of people paying the subscription fee was disappointingly low. Carbine will merely be the latest in a long line of companies that budgeted around half a million to two million subscribers and only got a hundred thousand or so.,WildStar,chmn0xo,2,t5_2sqwc

If the crafting isnt workable due to being too expensive then with luck the rest of the game will make up for it. Itd be a shame though  I like the crafting system theyve come up with and the idea of say not doing any crafting until level  then just sitting down and running the whole tree in a day or so and salvaging everything seems like a waste of time for the devs.  Why bother to even build an interesting crafting system if thats the way your players have to use it or go broke?  ,WildStar,chn6mdv,1,t5_2sqwc

Also since the achievements have valueunlocking the ability to buy with elder gems it could work well with for hire players not being a loot risk causing dissatisfaction among guild regulars.I do think theyve put some good thought into it and that its a step up from before. I always liked attunements and always thought the wow ones didnt really work as a skill gate. Hope the wildstar ones do. I also really like how theyre making attunements a reward from the raid bosses so you can pass them on to alts without having through the whole process multiple times which could definitely get tiresome.

1056171,0,t3_267bgf,Well Im not sure about the Stalkers stats and stuff but the Spellsplinger has a higher base crit damagecrit chance than the Warrior.I belive the Stalker is slightly stronger in that regard too.To clarify  you have two stats on  two on  and two on .For every lvl these stats will increase by the same amount.The Warrior has  in brutality  in Strikethrough RatingCritical Severity Rating and  in Critical Chance RatingCritical Severity Rating.The Spellslinger gets  Assault power  Critical Chance RatingCritical Severity Rating and  in Strikethrough RatingCritical Severity RatingSo in base stats the Spellslinger would have a bit of an edge in terms of Critical chance and critical damage but ofc. you have to take skills into account and whatever else comes to your mind.,WildStar,chocapx,1,t5_2sqwc

1066720,0,t3_26b626,Lets see.Avoid tanking. Tanking is a responsibility much like healing. But if you mess up the results are instant and cause wipes. Classes that have longevity usually are warriors. But this can severely depend on your preferences in terms of cosmetics and playstyle. In most MMOs Warriors are the goto mains for people and for a good reason. Theyre usually bit high skill capped funinyourface playstyle and are durable whether it is PvP Raiding or Dungeoning. You will not die in a single hit. So from what Ive said previously you will need to start out as a DPS before you can begin tankinghealing. You need to know the instance well ESPECIALLY as a tank. You must know all the boss mechanics and what will happen. You can learn these things by playing as a DPS and observing.  Watch what the tank does. Where does he tank the boss? What does he do at certain phases of the boss fight. Tanking is difficult but a very rewarding role. The most in demand.  Healing on the other hand is more forgiving though you will need to learn myriad of healing tricks to heal properly such as precasting healing before bursts over healing choosing which heals to use at the appropriate situation.All classes have either a DPSHealing specs or DPStanking so you will have flavor no matter which class you choose. But I strongly advise you stick to one class. I would try out all the classes to around lvl  ish. And then pick whichever you felt you liked best. That is what I used the beta for. I thought I would love Engineer. Boy was I wrong. Its a great class but it was not for me. Instead it came down to two classes and I will choose one during Headstart.In terms of raiding most raiders do not raid  nights a week. Youre thinking professional raiders you wont be coming anywhere near those anytime soon.  Most raiders do  days a week. With Wildstars  man only modes expect that number to be  nights a week if that.  So you will be fine my friend.Faction has no influence. Pick whichever side seems cooler to you. What differentiates a badaverageexceptional player? Speaking in terms of raiding. Two thingsKnowledgeAn exceptional player knows all the boss fights knows all the different abilities of the bosses and knows how to handle them.  They also have a great knowledge of how to maximize their gear what runes to use what enchants to have on their gear. They also must know their class in and out how to maximize their potential in raiding.AwarenessThis is the one that you cannot just look up online and do well. This one requires you to be aware of what is going on during a raid. Know the incoming abilities of the boss and be good at dodging them or reacting to them. Reaction is a big part of this not only do you need to be aware of what is happening during the raid but you need know how to react. How fast you react to different scenarios and be able to refocus yourself on the objective at hand is what makes an exceptional raider different from a bad one.Path wise Carbine has said all are relevant for end game but from what we have seen as a community Soldier seems to be somewhat lacking in terms of raid utility. Other ones should be fine. But I would get anothers opinion on this.A game that you can get some practice with telegraphs? The servers will be up and down up until headstart if you can get on and practice a bit then. Otherwise I would not stress about that bit by the time you hit lvl  you will have plenty of practice. Also in part of the game housing look forward to an object i forget its name but it basically puts a small arena in your Housing space. And in it is a challenge that will make you dodge telegraphs and such it is great practice for raiding. Hopefully I helped somewhat.,WildStar,chpjh1t,1,t5_2sqwc

1072442,0,t1_chq6meg,I have this conversation every single time I discuss paths. Its a stupid system. Ive yet to hear a single defense of it explain why it ISNT a stupid system.I hear a lot of I enjoy paths or Path activity X is fun or This was the intended purpose of paths perhaps you misunderstand as if the purpose of paths was incredibly arcane or Im just working with an incredible shortfall of intelligence.I have no problem with any individual path activity. Theyre not all winners but not every quest in any MMO is going to appeal to everyone. I do have a problem with arbitrarily gating off X percentage of your leveling content based on a decision made at character creation. What if I like jumping puzzles AND killing? Roll two characters I guess. What if I like jumping puzzles killing AND lore? Good times. And it further exacerbates the situation with a game with incredibly limited questing options and overrepetition of killclick task quests.Whats the BENEFIT of it? If those quests were in the common pool you could STILL choose what you like to do while leveling. Can you explain to me a single tangible benefit of Paths that could not remain ingame without those quests being segregated away into their own separate progression tree? One with notably tepid rewards at that?And can you do it without being combativeoverly defensive of Wildstar? From your first few paragraphs its fairly evident you A have no idea who I am andor are conflating me with someone else because I most certainly never charged Wildstar with giving you too much to do and B think Wildstar is the bright shining light in the MMO constellation because random snarky comparisons using  year old MMOs as benchmarks suggest an extraordinarily forgiving attitude towards the game in question.Or if you dont want to go that route you could just down vote me for having a negativetowardsWildstar opinion in keeping with subreddit culture until my loathsome opinions are hidden from the public eye.,WildStar,chq6vse,10,t5_2sqwc

Yes there is time to play the game but its also limited.Wildstar is rather dependent on wordofmouth for its success. Its like last week I had to explain to a friend what Wildstar was and showed him the What is Wildstar trailer. Yes he did cringe because it seemed like the typical overhyped WoW killer MMORPG story that he heard so many times and he honestly hated MMOs these days but had I not shown him the trailer he wouldnt have had a clue what I was talking about.If we stop comparing this game to the shortcomings of WoW nor talking about why its better than the biggest and most recognizable MMO on the market then nobody will have a clue what it is and that could hinder the success of the game. Wildstar is an entirely new franchise. WoW succeeded because it was a Warcraft franchise game and had Blizzards brand recognition behind it and generally because it had no real competitors apart from EQ which frankly sucked.Part of this is also why RIFT critically failed and went down the free to play route.

1086479,0,t1_chrrnl3,Hey thanks! I was just hopping in here to give my two cents. I appreciate the shoutout. D   Pallasity  Both classes are performing quite well in raids in both DPS and healing roles. Espers behave as a weird cross between a Rogue and a Mage with their primary combo point builder being a stationary cast and the bulk of their DPS rotation coming from building combo points quickly to dump on a powerful finisher. Rather than building points on a target however the points are built on the Esper themselves so they can use their finishers on anything. Medics are much more akin to a melee DPS class from WoW due to their relatively shortrange telegraphs but use a class resource called Actuators. Actuators are also very similar to combo points in that there built up with lighthitting abilities and spent on more powerful abilities but flow a bit more dynamically than the Esper resource. Want you consider to be a pro and a con is subjective but here are some defining class features  Medic   Mid range m though youll likely be stacking with melee   Very solid sustained damage using DoTs channeled abilities and consistent Actuator spenders   Excellent damage and utility buffs for the group   Medium Armor   Highly MobileEsper   Long Range   m   Powerful resistance debuffs on enemy   Spiky damage output with combo point system but very high average DPS   Primary PP Builder is a stationary cast   Light Armor,WildStar,chrs9wn,8,t5_2sqwc

You can group up with anyone in the world thats the whole point of games like these and several missions require you to do so.you can find a friend and go two different paths and do each others missions quest together compete in challenges who can get the most and basically anything you can do solo.Not all multiplayer requires groupfinders.Also itd go a bit against what Wildstar is trying to do with the early levels to make lvl dungeons. Carbine intends the early levels to be a tutorial of sorts so easy that people who have never played an MMORPG before can still get into it. Experienced players will race through it in a couple of hours and then never see it again maybe with alts. A small price to get unexperienced players into the game imo.,WildStar,chsxqh5,2,t5_2sqwc

Three servers per language is still pretty small. If you kept the English realms named the same as they are now it wouldnt be any worse than if you changed the name is my main point.Dont really see how carrying over beta servers names results in a higher population on those realms Gseventeen got  upvotes from people and I dont understand where that problem comes from gt.lt There are still going to only be  english servers I doubt  servers with beta names would be any more or less populated than a th one of a new name aside from guilds already setup who would feel like they have a home already.The only thing I can see as a positive with new names is that it will give that somewhat fresh feeling.

That number was written by a third party and it was written AFTER they started giving out beta weekend keys around k a weekend and opened the additional servers that everyone saw for openbetapreorder beta weekends.  So Im basically coming to my figure by deleting  weeks of beta weekend figures out of the k number and placing them all on a single server.TBH I personally think the number is actually HIGHER than k accounts per server but its all just me guessing.,WildStar,chtf1gg,0,t5_2sqwc

1133259,0,t1_chwvoy0,Personally Ive been happy with the launch thus far but with Full Disclosure my server doesnt have a queue time.That said the early launch is a technical failure.Servers go live at  AM Login servers overloaded play impossible Alleged DDoS attack but I bet it was just all the people trying to loginServices start to work at about  AM People can create characters Login queues develop no attempt to recommend lower population servers during creation process Bonuses unclaimable evade bug persists chat bug other issues plague serversQueue times worsen others unable to login Some are still unable to play Queue times have not gotten better No transfer services to alleviate overpopulated serversThat was just a very brief incomplete list of the problems.While many people have been able to get into the game and play with littletono problems that doesnt excuse the fact that many others cannot.Carbine offers this game service. Customers pay for this game service. When a customer is unable to access the service it means Carbine has failed.Sure other games may have had worse launches D Sim City Warcraft etc but Wildstar is not an other game it is Wildstar. The failures of past games does not excuse the failure of this one.Dont forget that Carbine had plenty of data regarding the number of interested players due to PreOrders being available for quite a long time. Since Head Start Access is available to all of those customers it was a safe assumption that a large majority of them would be playing.Did Carbine use that advanced knowledge to properly prepare the servers? Honestly we cant say. However from our point of view they did not and thats a shame.My next concern is what Carbine is doing to bandaid the problem. They are opening more servers to hope players will go there. This is a decent now solution but will screw the playerbase later. One of the more prevalent issues in an MMO is that players will leave or go inactive leaving servers sparsely populated. That problem needs to be addressed now. Not by opening more servers but by increasing the handled load of current ones.And I fear the worse may be yet to come ...   will see an influx of all the other players. The servers are already screwed how will they handle an even larger load?They wont.,WildStar,chx3nik,1,t5_2sqwc

1144277,0,t1_chy572h,Never played FFXIV. I understand that MMO servers arent heavy duty but one capable of holding more players is by the most basic definition better than one incapable of holding more players. Im not really sure what youre debating here... everything youre saying is correct but none of it is relevant to the point. Raising the player cap a little in the main cities and combining a few instances of those zones has nothing to do with the OVERALL player load that the server can handle. We can definitely handle a cap thats a bit higher and there are setting to reduceremove other player models so your video card isnt so taxed if it comes down to that.EDIT My bad thought you were the same guy as the above poster.

1148713,0,t3_279ank,I wanted to be mad at first but right away he states that he has very little experience with the game and its just his opinion based on that experience.

1148961,0,t1_chyv8u1,Well obviously he does have the job of being tank. What I mean is that as long as the DPS and Heals are good they shouldnt die. The tank really has no control over weather the DPS or Heals sits in a telegraph and kills themselves.If hes letting the boss run around killing everyone then hes just a bad tank. Thats the only instance where he has any control over the order of when people die but thats basic tanking . I wouldnt necessarily call that being good so much as just fundamentals.Being good is when your derpy dps agros that second pack and you have to go pick them up and survive way too much damage while also getting threat of all the new stuff or generally just timing your survival cds correctly as well as dodging telegraphs which everyone in this game has to be good at.,WildStar,chyvdez,2,t5_2sqwc

1149655,0,t3_27an4i,Best advice ask someone for a friend code and try it out yourself. Sure its somewhat limited  days level  among other things but its a great way to get a general idea of what Wildstar is all about. Ive played Rift GW FF and WoW.But in my opinion this is the most fresh experience Ive had in an MMO for awhile. Everything actually feels solid and polished. Will it last? Who knows but Im enjoying the hell out of the game so far. Sure there are some problems server queues performance issues small bugs but thats to be expected in a game with this much content. If youve been following the game and community youll know that the devs seem to be very open and communicate with players regarding problems. They added servers within hours of realms filling up they got transfers working before release to also help with the realm issues. They also post in here a lot just to let people know they are aware of issues so we as a community dont feel unnoticed.A lot of games hype features and when they come out are kinda crap. I havent had that experience at all in Wildstar. Everything pretty much lived up to expectations.But at the end of the day its your money and your opinion.,WildStar,chyy75b,1,t5_2sqwc

Itll start off really slow for sure... but once the hardcore raid guilds have the place down the BOE attunement items will start popping up on the AH and thatll trickle down to a point where casual raiding guilds can just buy them as needed to fill their raid spots.Its been too many years now to trust my memory on it but didnt blizzard do something similar in Burning Crusade? ,WildStar,ci0rnwl,1,t5_2sqwc

You can offer a serious challenge without excessively penalizing failure and in fact low penalties for failure can facilitate higher levels of challenge because players can put more time into overcoming the challenge itself if theyre not doing grindy things to cover the cost of failure.,WildStar,ci0yyl4,1,t5_2sqwc

1171287,0,t1_ci0xszu,So far only Level  here Adventures Dungeons and Shiphands are by far the best part of this game.If dungeon xp is balanced around completing all objectives and earning a medal I dont think most players are doing this and probably not on their first or even second time through. Many players are going to form the impression that Dungeons have poor rewards and not try again until they have to to progress their character  perhaps L.So far it seems like Dungeons are only comparable in rewards to questing if you in an organised group complete all objectives and are onlevel eg Level  going into Stormtalon. Frankly if you do all of those things shouldnt it be more XP andor Loot since it is much harder to pull off?Worst case is skilled and organised players level faster through dungeons  that really doesnt sound like a horrible outcome.,WildStar,ci1e22j,1,t5_2sqwc

1172485,0,t1_ci1ggjb,gt Not all bannable offenses are mistakes by the developers. Third party bots radar programs etc...So essentially only third party software should be bannable in your opinion? But those can and are be fixed by the developers too so even that is kind of the developers fault.gtBut why do you think its right to pay for a developers mistakes?Nothing that has built by humans have ever been flawless its retarded to expect a computer game to be.Why should you pay for exploiting something the developers left in it? Because youre hurting the gameplay of other people by cheating.gtIf developers dont want players to take advantage of exploits they need to try more QA and have better monitoringSoftware isnt bug free. No software has ever been bug free no software will ever be bug free. Theyre simply vastly too complicated for that to be realistic.This is of course even more true for a game who by definition has to be continuously updated with new content patches. gtThey should also have systems in place to roll back as much as possible if an exploit is found.The impact of a roll back is massive compared to banning the person who is using the exploit.gtNo a player should never be banned for anything achievable in game without any modification of the client or third party tools.Thats an opinion youre entitled to. In my eyes its a completely retarded opinion but still one youre free to have.gtPS Whats obvious to you isnt necessarily obvious to someone else.Which is of course why developers typically use some discretion. If you accidentally got one extra of an item then yeah maybe you were innocent.If you reprocued  copies of the item so that you could make a  truck load of gold from a vendor then you werent innocent. gtAnd whats obvious to the people instituting any bans isnt necessarily obvious to the person being banned.So fucking what?

The default price is  silver but theres only  ore below the  silver mark. The purchase will fail nothing will be bought. If I increase it to . silver now theres  available at that price.

The trick to fighting a spellslinger is to get up in their face and fight them. They arent super squishy medium armor but they can have mobility or damage. If you take damage you get shit on by warriors and stalkers because they can just run at you. If you take mobility you wont be able to reliably burst down squishies.A properly specced warrior will just shit all over spellslingers.

The best stalkers dont take stagger because it does no dmg and the stun is  sec but  percent of the time they have int armor and if they dont it still only last . seconds after the simple keyboard break...  and its on a  sec cd and its also buggy and doesnt always stun and only does the  dmg...  Im well aware of what my class is capable of  and our st dmg is equal to you spaming aoe to one person.  warriors can carry flags defend and destroy flags better than us by far no argument at all.  Lol at tether it had k hp  hits and its dead any good player can get out of that in  seconds oh and warriors have that to.  Like  Ss aoe the people attacking the fc will break the tether instantly. Im not saying stalkers are useless but they are outclassed by every other class and we dont shine in any area at all. Ss can make the fc run backwards for  second alone along with Perma slow and warrior s can knock him down and stun him for x the amount that a stalker can.Also to make sure understand i k ow my role in pvp I understand we arent weak. My point is why pick a stalker over a warrior or Ss in ANY role defending steal ing team killing utility. We bring nothing a warrior or Ss doesnt so in balance terms we are less powerful or however your mind can comprehend that we arent ad good as your class. If you cant understand that one class being weaker makes another op then so be it.,WildStar,ci3w8g2,1,t5_2sqwc

1196270,0,t1_ci450lp,gt This is very likely a small effect on why they are pricing CREDD above . After all they are willing to sell game cards in stores for  right?CREDD is not a game card.  CREDD can act like a game card but CREDD can also be transferred ingame for ingame currency.  Thus it has more value than a game card.  Obviously you could trade someone with much less security the code on a game card for some in game currency.  Or just straight up go the RMT route.CREDD is a hybrid and thus offers some of the complexities of both.  Its buying individual chunks of game time rather than subscribing.  But it can be bought online and it lives as a virtual object making it NOT like a game card.NCSoft and Carbine want to discourage CREDD as an alternative to their traditional routes for gametime since if it were at  it would offer all the benefits of game time cards without needing to purchase a physcial object PLUS it offers the flexibility that allows you to get cash.If you are buying CREDD you pretty much by definition have or have access to a credit card and can purchase online the primary reason game time cards are sold is to offer a method of funding your game time that doesnt require a credit card and thus could and probably would subscribe.By nudging the price up it differentiates CREDD from gametime cards in the marketplace as well as in realty where CREDD has differing functionality.Youre absolutely correct in that theyre replacing a  sale with a  sale but that isnt all there is to this either.,WildStar,ci475yn,1,t5_2sqwc

1205944,0,t3_27x8q7,Botting is a method of getting things money gear shinies with little to no interaction with the game and most time no real risk either.It allows people to do that good ol infomercial line of Set it and Forget it!  If I were to bot all I do is turn it on and walk away to do other things.  Things like go to work sleep play a different game what ever I want that isnt Wildstar.  When I come back though lets say after  hours of being at work I will have rewards money and shinies as though I had been playing that whole  hours.This is bad in a couple ways Ill start with the smallest way the one that has the least impact.  Botters in PvP matches just sit there and do nothing waiting in match until its over to reap the benefits of how well the team did.  Only problem is they do nothing for their team they dont harass the enemy they dont capture points they just sit in spawn.  This means that your team is weaker than the other meaning youre more likely to lose.The next step up from losing is a result of it.  Losing because of something out of your control like that one jerk Dave just standing there staring at the wall doesnt feel good and makes a lot of people angry or annoyed.  This means they are less likely to enjoy the game and more likely to leave resulting in fewer people playing meaning bots show up more often causing more losses.Even worse still is that it upsets the economy of the game at a certain point.  The largest currency in Wildstar and any other MMO is your the players time.  Everything about everything in the game can be brought down to amount of time needed to get or reach something.  Botting allows you to ignore that limiter almost as if you could play nonstop  hours a day  days a week  days a year.  Think of it like this Jimmie is an average player and plays  hours a day and wants to make  gold so he can buy Thunderfury.  The game says that making  gold should take about  hours on average.  That means that Jimmie and all average players will have about  gold after  days or a week of real time.  However the botter is able to get that  gold just  hours into day  and by the time Jimmie has his  the botter has  gold.  As a result the botter buys Thunderfury and causes the price to go up before Jimmie is even close to being able to afford it.  As a result Jimmie needs to spend more and more real time to get to that goal over what the game originally intended.  This is called inflation and while it would normally happen in a game just like in real life the botters cause it to happen unnaturally fast.  So instead of Thunderfury going from  to  after a week when average Jimmie buys it it goes from  to  after a day and a half when the botter buys it.This causes people to feel like they arent getting anywhere or need to bot to keep up since they typically cant spend much or any more time on the game than they are already.  This results in either more bots popping up causing inflation to increase even more or people to leave both of which are bad.In both of these cases the end result is either people leaving or more bots showing up.  Both of which put cause the damage bots do to increase resulting in more people leaving or turning to bots resulting.......  An apt phrase would be The wheels on the bus go round and round,WildStar,ci5acar,2,t5_2sqwc

The lowest population is about midnight PST to AM PST.  After PST you have the east coast players getting up in the morning and starting to play.  This is why patch time is always AM PST  It is the very lowest population time by a significant amount.   Primetime gaming is different than primetime TV.  Primetime gaming typically starts shortly after people get off workschool so usually about pm and typically goes til about pm.    ,WildStar,ci6dsz5,0,t5_2sqwc

1240149,0,t1_ci8h6a4,I would have to disagree on the PvP  PvE play style comparison. Back in WoW I spent a lot of time with progression raiding. Numerous US firsts. One the best means of filtering recruits cross server was if they had a respectively high rated arena team on their server. During the time I played WoW PvP was always more skill oriented then PvE. If you can PvP you can definitely PvE. If you cant PvP it was normally assumed you would be need to be carried or worse more gear dependent. Served us very well too.As far as the context on this discussion...PvP gear only hurts PvE when PvE players need to spend time in PvP to PvE. That is a very remote situation and outside of that everyone wins. Remember as the pool of people to PvE with increases the better it becomes for everyone. PvP does not suffer from this but PvE often does. Having a easier entry into PvE be means of any degree PvP gear or what have you the better off everyone is.,WildStar,ci94sly,1,t5_2sqwc

But before the support even arrived all other users of the car started shouting you are whiny you dont know anything about car business do you think they press a button and brakes are fixed kids nowadays Ford was exactly like this when it first manifactured i am driving perfectly fine i remember the days we stop the car with our feet blablabla. What the hell?And finally support says well we are making a weekly maintenance but your problem wont get fixed with that. wait for the monthly thing. we cant say monthly thing will work though. if it doesnt work wait for the next monthly.But isnt this your fault releasing the car too early? Why should i have to wait?lol you dont know a thing about car business this is real life get used to it loser whiny curse curse curseSo do i wait for the fix which can come in a monthmonths later or do i go for my older car? What would you do?Oh and mmos are complex yes. They are so complex that some single users managed to break that and fixed lot of UI errors which Carbine couldnt do because of the complexity. Enjoy.edit before some smartass says lolz you think ui and other parts of the game are at same complexity? no i dont but i expect that Carbine fixes these easy errors before users do. As we see fixing these simple errors are really simple and doesnt take any time. So why didnt we get these as official fixes? I want my addons to improve game not fixing them. edit  This subreddit basically consists two group of kids it seems both groups shouting each other YOU SUCK  NO YOU SUCK.

Being  level below quests is on track up until Grimvault you get experience much faster when you quest like this and you shouldnt have a problem killing the mobs.

1282344,0,t3_28rabk,Im gonna go on a little rant here.  Keep in mind I love the game but am currently very disappointed in adventures.When they first announced adventures I was pretty damned excited.  Being able to choose different routes find different loot down different paths?  I thought that was awesome.  My first concern was that as is always the case people will find the most efficient path but that should have been covered by finding certain gear down another path.  Little did I know they made the decision to have the best loot be based on performance ie. gold metal epic weapons.  This provides far too strong an incentive to ignore everything extraneous and simply find the quickest route to gold.  And what infuriates me is I honestly cant blame people for doing so.  I have no logical argument against it I can only say that I find that absolutely boring and counter to fun.I really wish theyd rethink the medal system.  My suggestion would be to have higher level medals not improve the quality of the loot but rather increase the volume or even simply have decorative items as the bonus rewards.  There is still incentive to want to do well I certainly like finding a somewhat unique shiny dcor.Dungeons...Ill stick with guild only on those.Anyways Ill stop there for now.,WildStar,cidvpka,6,t5_2sqwc

1288641,0,t3_28tuo9,I honestly dont know why the server doesnt do position checks every few hundred MS to see how fast theyre traveling. Seems like an odd coding oversight to me. Players can only go so fast  Taxi speed probably being the fastest but those fly along specific paths. They have methods to check player positioning its how their map system works. A few automatic checks on position to see how fast theyre moving and if it exceeds Taxi speed for  checks in a row kick them. Multiple checkfailkicks should be a ban and be done with it. The average person will never fail several of these checks in a row  Teleporting normally would fail one lag situations might fail a couple but no one doing anything reasonable would fail enough checks to be kicked by the system. I believe there are other games that do this kind of positionspeed checking as well and maybe there are better ways to do it but this seems the most obvious path to me for breaking this type of botting.,WildStar,ciel7ds,12,t5_2sqwc

1291871,0,t1_ciex0mo,If you havent keybound your stances which Ill assume you havent yet but you can! its in the keybinds section under stance and stance then you have to press the little arrow above your innate and swap it to the blue stance that has like the guy with the shield.  This makes you gain  resistance and greatly increases your threat generation.  It also changes your innate from resets cooldowns and increases damage by  to reduces incoming damage by  and increases threat generation by  which is awesome to pop for initial agro and also good in a pinch to prevent damage.At low levels pre you honestly probably dont have anywhere near enough support gear to actually run a support LAS and are better off just using your damage LAS in tank stance with a few support abilities that dont rely on support power thrown in for damage reduction or taunting if you have any.For the lvl  dungeons invest in a support set off the AH or have a friend craft you some as it is much more important.  But for the level  stuff you can totally get away with just swapping to tanking stance and using your DPS LAS pick up some damage mitigation from your support set.,WildStar,cieyacb,2,t5_2sqwc

They had actually NO max Level Instance in the game at the beginning. They added them in a later Patch. But because leveling took a long time for people they had enough time to insert them before the majority of people start doing and asking for endgame dungeons.So its not correct to say this. On the release WoW had non of them in the game or lets say they were not accessable at that point because blizz hold it back.Carbine said they would go for monthly updates so wait and maybe they will do some more dungeons.Scholomance was supposed to be an outdoor elite area probably where Sorrow Hill is now but the developers made it so big and good that they decided to make it an instance.And you call them max lv dungeons or instances but they where raids in the beginning of WoW.Blackrock Spire Stratholme and Scholomance were all tuned for  people raids.So please research a bit better before you spreading missinformation.,WildStar,cifouct,-1,t5_2sqwc

1305346,1,t1_ciggdrx,Im completely fine with progression being hardcore but I would hope it would do it in a way that isnt detrimental to the game.  Attunements are crazy and thats a good thing  its long not necessarily challenging but takes dedication.  Raids are hard and absolutely should be and I would even say dungeons should be the same to a degree.  Adventures should be a little more forgiving though.  Not necessarily easier but more rewarding even if you dont get gold.  Give an epic no matter what give bonus loot for medals.Yes its a hardcore game but if people wont run PUGs because they only want gold medals or leave immediately upon losing a medal youre breeding a bad environment thats ultimately going to end up hurting the game.  There is a time and place for hardcore and I think people all too often forget that.

1308909,0,t1_ciguyr9,Because it splits the community cheapens any sense of reward and makes the game dull.WoW still has some awesome Heroic raiding content. However I have no motivation to do it and I know a lot of people who do do it hate that you have to do it on multiple difficulties before you can even get to it.There is something to say that you did something that very few others did. When everyone can do it but some just get a few points more on stats then the content becomes cheapened.This game does have an LFR. It is called Adventures.The problem is people expect WoW from MMOs even though MMOs arent all like that. WoW is pretty much the only MMO where you can do everything no matter the type of player you are. Yet people now expect that of EVERY MMO.There is a very real possibility that I wont see  man raiding maybe even  man not because of lack of skill but because I dont have the time to dedicate to it.However it would be selfish and assholish of me to demand that I get to see it or that I should have my own special carebear give everyone hugs and free loot version of it.MMOs are about player interaction and overcoming obstacles as a group. THe MMO genre is meant to be about timesinks and group play. Single player games are about games for you personally.Also if I didnt have time to raid or have the skill to do certain aspects...then why the hell would I pick up a game that is aimed at that audience.That is like me playing a game of contact pick up football American and knowing that is what hte game is going to be but when I get there demand that for me personally it is touch football...even though I knew when I entered the game that it would be contact.,WildStar,cigvaa3,1,t5_2sqwc

After  though it does appear to be much more time worthy to quest. You get lots of stuff from the pvp bags which you can sell or salvage to make gold or have some crafting materials. If your not doing questing farming or harvesting between queues then thats a good way to supplement pvp leveling. I had maxed out my survivalist skill from just questing between queues. I have never pliayed another mmo that offers this much for leveling pvp and its pretty dope.Edit only do wakatikiliku temple if youre just trying to get to  quickly.

1340523,0,t3_29fdkf,Its absolutely fantastic from levels  to . The classes seem very well balanced considering the massive level differences and gear differences between the players and its a lot of fun to play during that time.But once youre  it just turns to shit. Well at least here on EU. I play Exile and we Exile here have like a  win rate. Or at least in my experience thats the case.No matter how many captures I personally get Dominion always just facerolls us and theres literally nothing I can do.Right now there is no point in playing anything else except Dominion and Warriors or healers in PvP at  here in EU. Dominion wins almost every battleground and every other class is trash tier damage wise compared to Warriors.Yeah Shitslingers and Espers and Medics can generally get a higher damage dealt number but it literally doesnt matter because Warriors just deal damage in a smaller area so their total damage is going to show up as lower when in fact Warriors just kill people in  hits and move on to their next target.I leveled myself from  to  with PvP I did like max  quests during that.As an Esper I felt pretty weak in Walatiki but then I learned of how easy its to carry games in Halls with an Esper I just spammed them over and over and in the end I managed to shitstomp my way through the levels with a  win rate in Halls. Out of the  games I played I think there were  or less games which I didnt single handedly wreck for our team. Esper is so good at taking side capture points in Halls!But then I hit  I was excited I was happy. Time to farm the rating and get the better PvP gear and then find an arena partner and destroy some games I thought..And well I feel like not even bothering to buy gametime anymore. PvP is such a massive clusterfuck at  right now.As I said either you play Warrior or healer or youre pretty much just trash and as an Exile I feel completely worthless because I cant ever win a game no matter how well I play.There are still times where I cap masks or capture points v but then Im left alone at the objective and I just die and they take it back.PvP to me seems like a waste of time right now unless its done in a premade and I cant have a full premade because I dont have friends to play with.So now Im stuck here with  days of game time left with this horrible feeling of wanting to play the game but not wanting to play the game.I bought this game entirely for the PvP I couldnt care less about PvE. At the same time I also only want to play Aurin its the race I chose back when I first learned of this game.This means two things . I suck at healing so I have to play damage only which forces me to play a subpar class because I cant be a warrior.. Im Exile so I cant win battlegrounds no matter how hard I try or how well I perform.So yeah these are my thoughts with PvP atm. Heavily favored for Warrior players and Dominion players.If I cant manage to farm the  plat I need for C.R.E.D.D by the time my game time ends Im not sure if Ill continue playing this game.,WildStar,cikfab8,0,t5_2sqwc

1343418,0,t1_cike4it,Esper DPS isnt that much worse with a more PvP focused build P. Frenzy essentially Espers seem strong if played right in open world. On my alt Esper I only really have trouble with well played warriors with the heal Debuff and sometimes medics fights last forever against medics and I dont have enough focus recovery at the moment.I was out soloing some primes in the Whitevale crater and I got ganked by an SS and a stalker. I broke CC they used both root and stun at the same time lol. Thanks... dropping pacify on them and the mobs then dragged shitloads of mobs and more primes on top of them till they ran and then I reset the mobs. Then I went looking for them and killed them both. I absolutely LOVE espers. Even though its only lowbie PvP and those guys probably werent very good players cant choose your gankers they feel really rewarding to play...

You have authoritarian statements that you simply disguise as opinions.Just look at the post below berating some bloke youve never met and will never meet because he simply outleveled you since hes not spending  hours of his day in his rockethouse rotating his Lopp Plushie the correct way. Thats essentially castrating someone for not playing the way you do. The hypocrisy runs to the high heavens.I only responded to your comment because its full of shit.You have absolutely no insight about the real content of the game endgame and youre making grand assumptions to soothe your lowlevel brethren that the gold sinks dont exist and that making gold isnt a problem.Right. Ill love to see your stupid fucking face once you hit Level  and see that a simple AMP reset costs  gold repairs go upwards to  Plat once you have  pieces of Purple and redying your gear goes upwards to  Plat. Tier  Mounting skill?  Plat.You know some of us are interested in progressing our characters in a reasonble amount of time. The fact that you take pride in only being Level  a month into release screams that youre a shitty player. Not someone Id ever like to be partied with. Theres nothing sublevel  to prepare you for Veteran Adventures let alone dungeons. Youre simply wasting your time to enjoy the content since everything you are currently experiencing is negated the moment you hit  as the leveling curve stops being linear and becomes exponential. Sorry to burst your fanboytinted glasses by the way but thats the way the game is.Dont speak about shit you dont know.

1347996,0,t1_cil9381,More and more it sounds to me like the choice is between esper and spell slinger.Medics are fun but have many fewer crowd control options and generally are more short range.Espers and Spellslingers each deal boatloads of damage both bursty but with spellslinger burst coming from controlled utilization of your class resource to jazz up your spells use the boost to get through! and have a lot of survival abilities to slot in do a barrel roll!  Espers have a a rougeesque combo points that you have to build up and then use all at once to go totally Fing nutz on people.  They have more crowd control options and over all do slightly better when they are in the thick of things.  Positioning is super important for both classes and again remember that our loving Carbine overloads in there great and terrible wisdom ONLY GAVE US  ABILITIES AT ONCE.  This means that you really will be more durable or have more output or more positioning abilities or more group buffs or more disables based on how you slot yourself up.  ,WildStar,cil9k9x,1,t5_2sqwc

They seem to be sticking to their pretty ambitious content update schedule so far...  It kind of sounds like you really want to raid but youre looking for a LFR queue system like WoW has. Its a pretty cool system that allows you to see the stories without having to put much time into progression. WoD is coming out soon and that sound more up your alley. Im personally excited for more challenging man dungeon content. Hopefully well see some new dungeonsadventuressolo stuff after the PvP drop next month. As long as they keep pumping out more soloman content Ill be a happy camper. Id love to raid but like you cant commit to a set raiding schedule. Love the PvP at least. PvP content keeps me entertained for hours. Seems like there is plenty to do besides raiding... those epic loots will make me envious though! ,WildStar,cinp4fk,1,t5_2sqwc

Its also not quite as dependent on Trigger Fingers as a Charged Shot or True Shot build but you should be working on finding that AMP as soon as possible.

Surged Assassinate is a good way to get extra damage dont surge below  target hp use QD instead or something and make use of your surge.

I could also cite fights where equally geared espers are at the bottom of the pack. You mention Fevir yet dont seem to grasp the message he was trying to relay in his video. Yes Espers can match most classes in DPS during patchwerkstyle fights that require littletono movement but the fact is that in any fight that requires heavy movement and constant adjustment Espers have to work x as hard to simply keep up with the pack. This is why Espers arent being brought to raids as their immobility is a HUGE liability.

However there are major issues with the bots that extend beyond the fact that they aggro.We need to look at the reasons why they aggro because herein lies the issues. They are unpredictable there was a bug that sent the bots to the last boss of Stormtalon and brought the whole dungeon to you. Often times they are uncontrollable. That pet bar you have? All of these commands cease to function. Their combat modes mean nothing. Passive defensive? Lets attack things out of combat anyways. What you address here isnt the issue being tabled at Carbine right now. I have no problem when my bots aggro a pack of mobs because I chanced going through a camp and got a little too close. What I dont like is when they disappear entirely and wont even let me mount wont return to me and wont allow to be dismissed.,WildStar,cish1fp,7,t5_2sqwc

But as i understand you accepted WowPlus is your work so this thing belongs to you Greetings everyone!Today Im proud to offer the community a first glimpse at the successor of my former Hacking Tool for WoW called WoWPlus this time for a different brand new game called WildStar.What is this thing about?Ive been working on this project for almost   years on and off now and it consists of around   lines of code not counting empty lines and comments. Its still lacking lots of features but the core systems are finished so far. I need testers to check out every corner of the software knowledge in Lua would be greatly appreciated.Features   I cant go much into detail about all the features yet but core features currently in for this test are        very large LuaAPI        integrated WebBrowser        ChatBox stay connected with other members! yay        detailed Object Tracking system        and ofcourse most of the features back from WoWPlusHacks so far        SuperFly        SpeedHack any speed possible does not speed up other things        JumpHeight        InfiniteDash        NoClip        NoFallDamage        WallClimb        Teleportation        Object TrackingCorrect me if i am wrong but this doesnt look like a thing a guy does for a small community and for fun because it is everywhere. Literally everywhere.So if this thing belongs to you writer clearly states that he is also the owner of WowPlus you are writing hacksbots for WildStar. I would like you to see doing an AMA to be honest. But this subreddit is not the place for it. Oh and legalcourt thing was just an analogy.,WildStar,ciugw9c,7,t5_2sqwc

1450264,0,t3_2arfu5,You already have gear for adventures and dungeons. If not pick up a tradeskill or three. Or have a buddy who has those tradeskills help you out. Then do adventures and dungeons with crafted gear. You will NOT be able to buy gear via the elder gem vendor that is even remotely worth a shit or worth the gems without doing dungeons and adventures first. They are unlocked by killing bosses in that content. Well crafted blues are often better than purples. You dont need to do dailies period at all ever. You can fill your elder gem cap even easier and faster by doing adventures and dungeons. They are a waste of time theyre intended to be something you screw about with while waiting for queues or when youre honestly only able to play solo for some reason. Or perhaps to play while drunk.Either way no you dont have to. You will miss out on nothing by not doing them. If anything youre missing out by doing them so much. Theyre a secondary source of gems and gold not a primary. Elder gems themselves are a secondary source of gear they are NOT intended to be the main way you get your gear and are designed to make such a method essentially unviable. You get your gear by either A making it yourself or B from drops in dungeons and adventures.Once the medal adjustment hits in a couple weeks or so getting that gear will be even easier. Stop wasting your time on shit that doesnt matter brah thats why you feel like youre wasting your time. Its because well you are.

1460311,1,t1_ciz7e3t,no what happened originally was NCSofts fault.  The ticket taking a while to answer is as well.  Starting a second subscription and issuing a formal dispute with paypal was the users action by being impatient.  Now it can be argued all day how long you should wait etc but once the user pulls that dispute trigger a few things will follow automatically in short order as a direct consequence. Including the account being turned off.If the goal was to continue playing the users actions were poorly thought out. If you want to end your relationship with a provider and just get your money back then dispute all you want. But injecting paypal into the middle of the process to decide if someone acted in bad faith is never going to make anything happen faster or improve your response from the provider.All the public shaming did was make the CS reps focus on his tickets ahead of other people who were waiting patiently.edit For all the people who dont understand why the account goes to the blackhole when a dispute is filed . of disputes are filed because the original transaction was made through a stolen credentials and the owner just found out or someone is trying to scam the system with timed orderschargebacks to play for free.

1487985,0,t1_cj2qiu4,Yeah I dont get all the comments about Wildstar having a bad release.  Ive been playing MMOs for well over a decade now and have played a good portion of the AAA MMOs at release.  Based on that I think Wildstars release was comparatively smooth.  Sure things couldve gone better and sure there are a lot of bugs that need squashing but I think Wildstar is one of the most polished and content heavy MMOs to come out in years.  In all my time in the MMO community the one thing I always find myself saying after release is that the game has potential.  Like if it just had a few more months in development or if they had just dropped a feature so they could focus on making something else better or if they couldve added more end game content and not counted on being able to get it out after release before people hit the level cap...  Has potential is sort of the MMO equivalent of bless her heart.  Wildstar is one of the first MMOs in years where I dont really get that feeling.  Theyve established a very strong foundation and every feature feels fully realized and not just tacked on in a rush.  Obviously the game isnt perfect and there are balancing issues and some glaring issues in PvP and those are all valid criticisms but no MMO is ever going to release in a state close to where WoW is now.  It doesnt matter if youre comparing it to a decade ago or today despite how far the MMO genre has come launch woes are inevitable and on the whole I think Wildstar has largely come out ahead.,WildStar,cj2slbe,2,t5_2sqwc

I ran the dailies a few times but quickly got tired of them. Run  vet adventures a day and make about  gold on a good run per.Just doing my daily crafting costs me ish gp. I would have to run  vet adventures to get that . Just got up to making chest adventus so I need to run them to get the points to buy the gated gear to make the gear I need.Im also finding that salvage is pretty useless. I rarely get anything useful and would do better selling the item for gp and buying the mats.Maybe I am just one of those people that will have to buy credd to sell it for plat to keep playing but Im probably not going to last longer than another month.Im really curious why vet adventures net so little gold. Id rather just run those but wow pointless if you need money... but you need to run them for other reasons. Would it really break things if they paid  gp for completion?

Either misses are so bad you want to get rid of them totally or they are minor enough that you can ignore them. There is no middle ground.In order to prevent that from happening all stats need to have an extremely well tuned DR curve and be balanced carefully with every other stat. Right now AP doesnt have meaningful DR and everything else has severe DR so stacking AP is better than everything. Another option is to have groups of stats so you never choose between say Crit or AP because their budgets are different and you can only swap crit for hit or grit etc. Frankly I think they made their stat system way too complex and since which stats means what varies based on class i dont see how they can unfuck it without a complete redesign which is very unlikely at this point.,WildStar,cj4j5h1,1,t5_2sqwc

I am looking forward to finishing my attunement but I still think it is far too difficult. Never was any attunement stage as hardcore as this and it doesnt need to be for a first step into raiding at . I absolutely love having hard raids and it is great they are there BUT there also needs to be easier ones available too. Let the hardcore raiders have their cake but give others a taste too. Instead of having the top  raiding it should be the top   still locked out for half the population but much more accessible and very doable for anyone who really wants to make that step. Right now the difference between adventures and dungeons is a joke. Dungeons should be nerfed a bit so there is a better feeling of progression between them from adventure and dont feel like a chore.

The MMO community just isnt what it used to be and I think Carbine overestimated the size of the niche that theyre targeted with this game. There are also a lot of people who will talk a big game constantly about how much they miss the hardcore days of WoW only to remember all of the little inconveniences and tedious little things that the genre has since done away with. I dont consider myself or my guild hardcore. We are all adults who for the most part have responsibilities. We do not raid and right now by raid I mean grind silvers  nights a week. But so far weve only lost a few people out of . Perhaps weve just got lucky in finding a group of people who also fit into this games niche. The game requires patience. For all but the most hardcore it does not give instant gratification. Im okay with that. I think now its just a case of enjoying it while it lasts because while I think for the most part I fit into the spectrum of people who would enjoy this type of game I realize Im in a small minority. Maybe theres a middle ground to be achieved but I hope that when Carbine inevitably strives to find it they dont ruin the game completely. ,WildStar,cj8heal,2,t5_2sqwc

I dont see a problem here raiding wasnt meant for  of the playerbase.I have to agree with the PvP one theyve failed on many fronts there trial and error will fix that mmos arent a  hour and walk away game.  MMOs arent traditionally popular on Twitch.  Its growing but mostly flavor of the week mmos or WoW which has a LARGE established playerbase.False due to ignorance.Then stop crying.  Probably as far as youll get.  Ill say bye now so I wont have to say it in a month or two.Maybe less than a month.You cant start a post by saying Im not trying to say I told you so then end it with I told you so and not sound like a complete moron.Your unhappy with the current state of the game and an Idiot.  Id be sad if I were you too.  Crying on the Wildstar subreddit isnt going to get you sympathy.  Making complains based off of your own assumptions and opinions without recognizing what theyre based off of doesnt really help anyone.  Carbine knows that they have done a poor job on several fronts with their launch.  Being a large company filled with people whos livelihoods depend on the game doing well Im sure the developers are doing everything they can to fix those problems.  Some of it is a very slow process from the point of view of the content consumer.  It feels like weeks and months move by to us while internally theyre verifying the problems then taking in input from internal and external sources for possible fixes then creating those possible fixes testing them to make sure they dont break everything and if they do maybe restarting the whole process.  Wow doesnt fix bugs every week theyve had years and years to hammer out little issues like mobs resetting or lack of content for a  of their playerbase.  Carbine has had a few months.  Decide to wait it out leave and look back in the future when things might be better or leave altogether.  Dont cry because your not getting what you want fast enough thats childish and helps no one.Ill probably get a lot of downvotes for this one.  I was definitely unnecessarily  an ass for most of it.

1604645,0,t1_cjhfgxc,I did raid the last few tiers of wow. One of the tiers I was in a  man raid group. We wiped on the second boss of Throne of Thunder for  months when it was current content one of the tanks was a little bit of a dumbass which didnt help. After a month or so they adjusted the difficulty since a lot of guilds were stuck on the second boss out of  bosses. After the second boss some bosses took a few weeks other bosses took  week if you were on point.I also raided in SWTOR this year since I bounce around raids when I get bored with a game. They also get credit for some good challenging raids and with  man raid groups  low requirement for entry which helps since SWTOR really isnt bursting at the seams with packed serverspopulation,WildStar,cjhfmgl,4,t5_2sqwc

1606141,0,t1_cjhhfev,What? VP capping is grindy? You gotta be out of your mind for saying so. The cap is exactly the counter to the possibility of farming that becomes grindy. I dont care if you think all the alternative catchup methods provided for folks returning or starting anew. Bear in mind all of those grind is NOT required for raiding.

Im not from this guys guild but I downvoted you and upvoted him because your posts are childish and hostile and his is substantive and well thoughtout.As someone who moderates a couple subs and has moderated others in the past I can tell you that hostile posting is almost always a guaranteed downvote train. The only exception is when you have a very strong hivemind opinion behind you.This sub is too small for you to get away with making extremely hostile posts without everyone downvoting you and burying your posts simply out of spite.Another tip is that when you start hurling accusations of vote rigging or generally just talking about your votes and karma you attract even more downvotes because no one likes people whining about downvotes.,WildStar,cjk9b13,8,t5_2sqwc

1641449,1,t1_cjm10ex,This is an issue? Ok Ill give you that. But its not an issue with the game. Its with the players. Weve been coddled by the devs of other games to the point where a guild isnt even necessary in other games. Wanna raid? Lfr and bam. Wanna group? Queue up youll be done in  minutes with shiny new epics. Wildstar says fuck that. You want to get the shiny shit youre gonna fuckin work for it. We just had a guild meeting tonight where I pointed out that of all the people proclaiming their desire to raid most of them wont make it through attunement. Of those that do there will be more who step in and realize its not what theyre looking for. And you know what? Thats fine. Our guild is multidiscipline. Want to preraid pve? We can arrange that. Pvp? Sure. Rp. Why not. War plots?... thats a problem area right now. Wildstars development philosophy is less everyone gets a participation ribbon for not shitting their pants today and more you cant hack it you get nothing. Again thats fine. This game isnt trying to be everything to everyone we should stop expecting it to be that. Theres already a game out there doing that and a majority of us put our time in there.

The game hasnt been popular enough to warrant a forum of its own there and theres no sign that it will pick up. MMORPGs Wildstar forums are also dead. Sos GameFAQs but thats not a busy site for MMOs anyway.  I hunt around on the pro and semipro gaming sites and I see nothing except a recent article on Massively that was linked here that was very mixed about the game. The games profile is so low it might as well be dimensional.  If the idea was to NOT attract people to it until its more polished....well I guess it worked. Now they have to polish it up and hope they can overcome the negative wordofmouth thats floating around in the gamesphere to get people on board again when the games actually ready for prime time. And Im not being sarcastic here  several recent AAA MMOs have stumbled badly out of the gate but have either recovered or are showing signs of recovering at least financially. If you want to debate whether theyve recovered in an artistic sense Im not going to do that because artistic merit is mostly subjective.  So its conceivable Wildstar could do the same. But the fact that its an entirely original IP  and that the dev team seems to be intentionally aiming at a limited player base makes me wonder if it will be able to pick itself up dust itself off and get back in the race.

1783116,0,t3_2exn43,Hey Stalkers I wanted to take a minute to give a heads up of what changes you can expect in the next major patch.We are addressing some quality of life issues as well as some balance for AoE DPS here are some more specific examples Neutralize and Ruin will be receiving a buff to their damage. Additionally Neutralize will stack fewer times and has had its tier  and tier  slightly reworked to increase its damage output. Bloodthirst has been reworked to give an outgoing damage buff at the base tier in addition to its Lifesteal. Additionally the Tier  and  have been reworked. Stim Drone has been reworked to have a CC Break at base. With the upcoming changes to Assault and Support Power being adjusted to match other classes Brutality Mastery was performing far better than intended and has been adjusted to compensate for that change. The cooldown on Stealth is will reset when the Stalker dies.Beyond the adjustments listed above we will be focusing on the Tank spec for a more distant patch. A few things we are investigating  Improve Support style AMP selections. Improve the effectiveness of minimally used Abilities and Ability Tiers. General look at Threat gained per damage dealt.

Even assuming you all just recently bought the game it takes like a week to hit  even playing casually. Youre complaining about the game not being casual friendly but you obviously didnt research the game at all because from the very beginning the devs have been saying this game is for hardcore players. If you want to actually complete the amazing and difficult group content follow these two steps. . Level to . Dont waste time in low level Dungeons. Theyre unnecessarily difficult for their level and dont offer enough rewards you level much faster by questing. . Join a better guild. Seriously if youve out leveled your entire guild then I have zero confidence that any of those casual players will ever set foot in a raid. You may just think Im being an asshole and Im prepared for the down votes but Im honestly just giving you the advice that Id give to myself here. WildStar is an extremely hardcore game and if you want to get the most out of it then you need to become hardcore.  If you arent able to do that then this isnt the game for you. There are plenty of other games that cater to casuals. ,WildStar,ck5jity,1,t5_2sqwc

As much as I love the taste of your delicious tears you have nothing to cry about...EDIT Also the whole preorder name reservation thing was a huge fiasco and pissed off many people. There were a ton of website issues that caused very long delays and lots of people who had planned their schedule around the designated reservation launch time were screwed over by these delays. There were also many bugs that simply would not allow certain letter combinations. My name for example was to be Malachi but the letter combo of ala caused a bug and I couldnt reserve it.

1822760,0,t1_ck8t6xa,I have read all the of arguments against the usage of timers but they are all fail to address some very key components of the argument I have presented multiple times for the usage of timers. Timers create a sense of purpose within a dungeon. A need to make smart decisions quickly. If I have unlimited time to beat this boss all I need is a little rng and a bit of luck to get through it. Making intelligent well executed decisions is no longer required...I just have to get lucky. This same RnG that you are talking about can play into your favor...just as much as it can play against you. The only dungeon with a legitimately rough timer is Skullcano. And that has honestly been alleviated a little with the new rez point so its not that bad. My group tested dungeons just to get an idea about rez times walks back and low dps when we were asked to start carrying people through raids. All assumptions are made with k group dps assumption on a single target mobile fight. DPS k per is reasonable All assumptions were also made that you do not wipe on an optional boss.In STL you can wipe on every boss  time with  additional wipes and still make silver. In KV you can wipe on every boss  times and still get silver. In SC you can wipe on every boss  time and still get silver. This is the toughest timer to meet if you are not cheesing bossesIn SSM you can wipe on every boss  time with  additional wipes depending on which boss you wipe on. This was tested by averaging k dps per Single target most dps can do .k regardless of fight...k is more accurate though fight and purposefully wiping to mechanics after the boss gets to  health.So if you are missing silver its more than bad rng. Its a complete failure on your teams behalf. There is plenty of time to get silver and still wipe.  ,WildStar,ck8ty9v,2,t5_2sqwc

If they change the game to be more attractive to casual gamers or even a FTP model I wont be coming backAND YOU KNOW how hardcore raiding BECAME A THING IN WoW?Wildstar tried to have hardcore raiding from the start. WoW had raiding since vanilla but....the whole point of hardcore raiding is more than self challenge its to PROVE something.Why do you think people chase world firsts etc?But they arent going to do it in a game nobody cares about. Because the achievement wont matter to anyone.Hardcore raiding didnt become a thing UNTIL WoW had already become a popular game yknow...with POPULATION. And that...is the problem right now in Wildstar people are leaving. Thats the problem though not the cause. The hardcore will always existbut they are the very very very very few. While the Pareto Principle says that  of your profits can be made by  of your customers...the ers right now youre talking about cant do that for Carbine. So they must address more casual players in some manner whether they be young folk or aging gamers.gt Its unlikely new players will pick up this game en masse with the horrible PR and bad rep the game is getting in gaming media.I dont know. Anything that goes from pp to fp gets a SURGE  of membership but it only sticks if gameplay has been improved from before and then...still have the problem of monetizing the game under a new model.One possibility is fixing things first and then giving a free  days to anyone that wants it if they think they can handle server loadnothing like those few games that go from ghost towns to overloaded Some games end up better after fp while others have little new contend and are just sort of put int maintenance mode for eternity so long as they manage to turn some kind of a profit.,WildStar,ckzzo8n,1,t5_2sqwc

You open the doors to the masses now and youre more likely to lose the small audience youve retained than recapture the large one that already passed you by.How can people stare at you in envy if theyve left the game? The demographic that youre describing would still want the casuals around so that they could drool over their gear in Thayd.

2142337,0,t3_2jiwxw,As much as Id love both servers to thrive at the moment its just not going to happen. The open world pvp aspect in wildstar is extremely lacking with little to no incentive to do world pvp. I leveled from launch on Hazak when the servers still had huge ques and there were players everywhere. People didnt bother with pvp and I think that the first time I did world pvp was at level  and I got ganked by a group of  who just did the quests and packed their bags. I didnt have a single v or people even bother to attack me until . No one cared or will care. I think I had around  pvp encounters from lvl  at the prime hype train in Hazak.Comparing that to for example Archeage I had a pvp encounter every  minutes once the crossfaction zones started. It was pure joy after having absolutely none of that in Wildstar. Why is that? Because Archeage is really focused on pvp and incentivises you to do it with zones at war and big honor rewards while wildstar has nothing but the occasional gank in daily zones and the zergs that you posted.The pvp aspect of this game is currently focused in arenas and bgs and you dont need to be on a pvp server to do that. The illusion that the best players will always stick to pvp servers is quite rampant it seems. The truth is that the best pvp players go to the most populated servers to find dueling practicepartners for rbg and arenas.,WildStar,clc50ju,9,t5_2sqwc

2260052,0,t3_2kywo0,As a causal player I enjoyed wildstar but without friends or a guild I couldnt play much longer. Leveled and enjoyed the game but none of my friends wanted to leave FF or WoW for wildstar. I understand I could have joined random people but the queues were long and not rewarding for a causal player like myself. I hope others in the game keep it alive but for now I will be leaving. This subreddit had its ups and downs I think the biggest failure of the game was lack of advertising. At least in my network of friends and gamers the only gamer that knew about it was a buddy of mine that was a hardcore MMO player. Any causal players like myself heard about it through him which in turn made it hard to enjoy without friends joining. The MMO subscription along with lack of advertising kept all my friend circle away looking to see if it would take off. Sadly they have stayed put with their MMOs. Thanks rwildstar for the news and I hope this doesnt anger anyone just felt like saying my part before unsubbing. That is my take on the state of this game a sad one for sure.

2263968,0,t3_2l3qem,As someone who plays MMOs because of raiding and pretty much raiding aloneThere doesnt need to be solo content so much as things you can do that others also might do with a tangible reward. I remember way back when raiding in WoW. I raided  hours a week and logged in every day to run heroics and a bunch of other stuff because those actions had a tangible easytounderstand progression helping you meet your goals ingame and outside of raid.Which is one of the things I dont understand in the design of this game  if it was so focused on HARDCORE raiding and catering to raiders why is there nothing outside of raids that help you meet your goals? Nothing nada not a damned thing.In Wildstar you do it once you never ever have to do it again and considering the level of difficulty some of these things have relative to their rewards there is no reason other than a twinge of masochism to do it more than once. Not even the gear is any good and even if it was it isnt worth the pain for so little and unbearably random gain.I do two things in this game now raid three days a week two and a half hours at a time and sit AFK in Thayd while I watch Netflix.

The best way to craft gear is to just fill in your main Attack Power stat and get it as high as possible dont overcharge too much of course if youre low on materials and dont wish to spend the money dont overcharge past .Dont skip too many quests however youll regret it at lvl  where you need max reputation with your faction dominion or Exile to get attuned for raids.

Unfortunately after The Strain patch was released we just couldnt take the small things anymore. One by one we left. It was really a huge bummer but I can at least say most of us follow the game and look for a shining light and a reason enough to come back. The megaservers seemed like a neat idea but when I realized that my character names were no longer unique because of last names I was crushed.

Of course the Espers disagree now because they can v with one hand now. Play one youll see. They wont be fixed any time soon. Keep in mind that real skill and talent comes from PvP not PvE.

Wont lie the population is low no denying that but there is certainly enough population to get things done.

3499726,0,t1_cpqrhhf,I feel like gear is the biggest problem Wildstar has nowadays. Everything else got fixed pretty good. But the thing is you need to give players Reward for things they do ingame.

I enjoyed stat minmaxing in WoW specially in WotLK when Armorpen was a thing and they still had sockets socketcolours and stuff ...I dont play WoW anymore because they dumbed down the gear and stats that made the game just unfun for me.I have the same feeling with Wildstar.

3501183,0,t1_cprbwzi,Of course I am not telling them to stop caring about the existing playerbase thats ridiculous. Im telling them to make some concessions to bring in new players. Generally speaking to soften the blow some rewards are added for loyal players.Bad system? It can be badly implemented but the idea in itself is not bad. It can certainly be done well I quite enjoyed how SWTOR handled it.You are using specious and very selfish logic in determining who should be focused on and youre also treating it like giving one side attention means death for the other. Look at it like this if you like the game enough to commit  euro to it and have no current plans of ending your subscription why would a sudden payment model switch suddenly cause you to lose your loyalty? You can still pay a subscription fee and receive ALL the benefits but now theres an option for people who DONT want to pay that fee. How is that bad enough to make you cancel your subscription?Im sure you know this but in an MMO more players means more money and more money means more content and support for everybody.,WildStar,cprcyjq,3,t5_2sqwc

3511564,0,t1_cpsi5fz,I was in SWTOR and watched the change. The game was better before the monetization change the content had more quality the games vision was what I was paying for. That all changed for the worse postchange. The same has happened in several other games.Not only that but the community itself becomes much worse in all these games that go FP well lineage  might be an exception it didnt change much but that is far from the norm.If the choice is to be between a small very good game or a large average game Ill go for the first one. SWTOR is the prime example of how the choice should be easy for the players.EDIT Also I do not agree with your definition of being outshined.

You cannot put the snarfelynx or the glitterkitty on either the CE or the AH or at least you couldnt yesterday. This is not a why just a statement of fact. It is the truth. I have no idea why. Ask Carbine I guess if you want to know?

If you have already paid for the client then you wont have any restrictions.  You can even earn plat to buy CREDD with and pay for your sub that way. I dont think anyone outside of Carbine and NcSoft can give you a definite answer on where its going.  Lots of speculation sure but guarantees nah.  If you dont want to take that chance if you prefer to not deal with the chance of heartbreak then dont.  That said if no one gives it a chance because they are to afraid of possible failure then the game has no chance.  With a bit of paraphrasing  It is better to have supported and failed than to have never supported at all.  Thats probably a bit of stretch but hopefully you get my point. Regardless wherever you play I hope you have fun.,WildStar,cr2cap2,2,t5_2sqwc

It gives you a side purpose around leveling. Just curious to see what peoples thoughts are edit Its especially nice in GW because you can level an alt while doing your normal dailies. This might not work for WS directly but if a method could be figured for it that would make it amazing imo.

4007680,0,t1_crct5xp,Youre entitled to your opinion.  Warplots? I still had no idea what was going on after my rd warplot. Ive done over  of them now and I am still learning new things. I dont think having NPCs in pvp is such a bad idea see alterac valley and any MOBA. Whats so bad about a stalker using stealth to his advantage to sabotage his enemies base? After all strategy is playing to your classes strong suit. To attribute Warplots as the reasoning people left this game is very misleading statement to make. There were issues with influence that prohibited pvp guilds from participating in a guildly fashion is a more accurate reasoning for QOL issues with leading a pvp guild in this game but this has been fixed. There is a plethora of PVP content that even WoW doesnt provide one of those being Warplots.  People just dont want to lead players theyd rather follow a zerg rather than explore potential strategy themselves. Thats a player issue not a design issue.I will agree that warplots do have their flaws but none of which you stated are valid IMO.

4121537,0,t3_37qp6y,I think its more people dont understand or have the right build but there are other reasons too that ill get into.People are for the most part completely fine when it comes to ElectrocuteEnergy AugerMortar Strike build however its quite underpowered compared to many other classes in  enemy cleave situations so the DPS isnt top on Elemental Pairs that cleaving is the best option.The Bolt CasterBioshell build is another story though some people just dont have the AMP setup properly and have trouble maintaining the zone for class resource the build is quite clunky if you dont have the first  dash regeneration amps as you wont have enough dash to keep your uptime at its highest and will cause you to wait to regenerate more dash or resource.Another tip is to start a fight with Energy Auger on the Bolt Caster build and then Bioshell so you have  dash tokens available from the getgo rather than using them both at the start to initially get to the zone.The classes DPS is also quite dependent on the amount of AMP points you have unlocked as several AMPs are just a flat DPS increase with explosive shells and unstable volatility so youll need all AMP points to fully get the most out of your DPS.The class also requires  completely different specs one for cleave and one for single target so it will require  action sets unlocked if you tank for your offspec which is an additional burden not to mention Engineers are practically never top DPS on any fight Not due to rotation you can have a top notch cast counthit and only be top  in Datascape.Due to the way our crit is naturally higher than all other classes we also have to rune for AP much higher than other classes most classes stop stacking AP runes at about  whereas for us to be optimal we have to rune upto about AP.,WildStar,crq2wfb,1,t5_2sqwc

4123893,0,t1_crqbbzc,There is no restriction like this but it is partly correct. Guilds will raid with their members only unless they they need to fill empty slots with random people.The purpose of guilds is to unite players with similar goals thats why we have PvEPvPPvX and roleplaying guilds. In guilds people tend to make bounds between each other it becomes your gaming family. That is why most guild will require you to fill a registration form or they will interview you before accepting you as their member. You are more likely to do stuff with your guildies than with random people like you would do with your family or close friends rather than with total strangers. But when a guild member is also interested in something different than rest of the guild heshe joins a circle focused on it. There are pretty much no requirements for joining a circle and the said person will most likely not make any bounds with other members of that circle. The circle pretty much only serves its functional purpose.Example Bob likes everything about the game and he especially enjoys raiding. He joins a guild called Aplhabet that raids at same times as he plays the game. He raids with its members runs dungeons and other group content with them helps others when they need it. He enjoys chatting with them via guild chat or voice comms he even establishes a really strong friendship with some of its members. But then he finds out that he wants to do warplots sadly there is not enough players interested in PvP in his guild. He joins the warplot circle so he can find other players to run them with. He will most likely not make any friends with other people in the circle as he is fine with who is he running the warplots with as long as he is able to run them. This is not always the case as there might be circles just for chit chat or RP there it could be the exact opposite,WildStar,crqckf4,1,t5_2sqwc

4165789,0,t3_38gnbv,As a player of The Guildwars franchise since I was  I understand where you are coming from. Guildwars  was my first MMO and thus I have blinders on when concerning anything to do with it.Guildwars  is a trash game all things considered this is coming from a guy who played GW from releaselaunch day of GW you name it Ive done it in GW. GW lacks meaningful content in terms of character progression and immersion unless of course you consider getting the new dress to replace your old dress meaningful content which I do not. If you decide to stay with GW instead of at least getting to  in WS you are robbing yourself of a great experience.The FP announcement has done nothing but good for WS as I can see I resubbed after quitting  days ago and rolled an ALT wildstar is alive again and from what Ive seen its growing every day as we get closer to FP my guess is that WS will reach launch numbers and hold at just under it due to the nature of the hard core setting to endgame progression.And In closing my best experience in gaming thus far in my life is getting silver in Veteran StormTalons Lair with  life long friends I made in WS it took us  weeks but damn it was a great experience.Keep going with WildStar you wont be disappointed and if you end up not liking it then its FP soon anyway you can come back whenever you want.,WildStar,crv3x6r,0,t5_2sqwc

4170636,0,t1_crvn8pn,Try the  day trial for FFXIV first. I hit level  in about  days way under  hours of play and combat is slow unengaging and boring. Apparently it gets better at  but in my entire life of gaming Ive never felt so bored leveling up a character.Maybe a different class would suit you I tried ninja it was awful. Look for cdkeys on GA GPlay or Kinguin so you can try it out. There is a new expansion coming soon which is the only reason I played it. Its a beautiful game but IMO thats all it has going for it. WoW is still better in every shape or form but the end game raids are Man which is awesome because its easy to field a team. But it felt like a chore to level maybe I am just burned out on MMOs but that was the worst combat Ive ever experienced in my whole life and I hate it. It is slow the whole game is slow and there is nothing fast about FFXIV  even city states have about  zones each loading screens there is nothing fast about ffxiv except for teleporting.I dont mean to bash FFXIV its an okay game with a good following  its just not for me unless you enjoy very slowed down combat so you have time to think between the . second global cool downs.,WildStar,crvns2q,2,t5_2sqwc

For the purpose of balance only id say offer a mercenary reward if the zone population is currently different between the two factions and then let people temporarily align themselves to the other faction as a mercenary.Ive played on  open PvP servers before DAoC etc and while theyre a lot of fun theyre also chaotic and far less structured.

I would still like to have the option now.Giving players the autonomy to make choices like banning gives power in an otherwise random engagement. Random is great sometimes but a certain amount of control can improve quality of life. Especially for people who play a lot. Im aware that effected players would be  of the PvP player base who made it to the PvP elder game. Also making a banning option would give Carbine a good pointer to what BGs they could improve on.Furthermore implementing the same ban system for dungeons would be a good service to offer.

4663795,0,t1_cti8hra,You are wrong about quite a few things.If you dont like pvp in WildStar then you shouldnt play it. BUT in last patch they added samefaction BGs new raitingsystem and pvpspecific contracts that rewards you with the best pvpgear currently in the game. In the upcoming drop theyre adding a new battleground and will also start a new season together with fancy new pvpgear legendary if Im not misstaken.You are pretty much right about queues battlegrounds are pretty good arenas not so good warplots  forget about it. the warplots are pretty shitty so its not a big lossWildStar shines in its raids IMO but the pvp isnt horrendous. I really like BGs with  premades against eachother it can be really epic even though those games might be rare. The arenas are probably even better but I havent yet gotten a steady group for it and cant really say.There is still a couple of pvponly guilds on EU server so its just not me who think its fun. I wouldnt play WildStar for its pvp alone but this guy is obviously just a crybaby.,WildStar,ctifdhf,1,t5_2sqwc

4741634,0,t1_cts4qaa,Ill try explaining as best as I can. I cant access the game at the moment on vacation so I cant link you pictures but hopefully youll get what Im trying to explain!With the scan icon constantly on their heads part youll notice that its normally on mobscorpses and plants. This is because scanning them gives you a special buff. Even though youve completed the quest its either biology or botany type quests I cant recall you can still scan them to get the buffs. Which is why you always see the icon above the unit even after completing the quest.When I was levelling up my scientist I always looked at my map and moused over the atom icons to see what path quests I havent completedpicked up yet. Then I checked my quest log in the path tab to see the  progress or what I need to do to complete it. The video you linked was with the old UI and datachron which had the progress bars. Unfortunately with the new UI and datachron it ceased to exist.Im afraid you will have to consciously keep track of the progress of each path quest by checking M and the quest log. Im not sure if there is an easiermindless way of keeping track of things but this is the best I can offer for now.,WildStar,cts8744,1,t5_2sqwc

4763283,0,t3_3g0upz,It seems to me Taprack that most of your posts are all about how awesome you think WoW is and how Wildstar is not.  Why are you here?  Trying to figure out why.  Want Wildstar to be a WoW clone but different story combat but all the same features?  Because I dont.  Just seems the majority of your posts are bashing Wildstar.  Now to respond to your post WoW expansion is a year away.  I know they want to make content come out faster but every expansion is about a year after announcement.  Especially if putting the Beta at the end of this year.  Seems to me that they are just riding the cash cow and they should low risk very high reward.   million accounts means  million in profits.  Not bad haha.  Alot of WoW to me has developed to the casual crowd which isnt a bad business decision especially in the later life of a MMO  years is a long time.  Some just not looking for that.  Yes casuals are a HUGE amount of cash for MMOs but the press and the bragging comes from the hardcore crowds like the raid rankings.  Alot dont like casuals and its not the hardcore epeen crowd just some of the toxic that comes into games are from casuals and able to troll and than reroll basically and annoy more. There are some toxic coming from epeen hardcore too just in MY experience its more from casuals.  But I think if they did this expansion before WoD it would of been better.New class  Seems to me to be a little late should of included this class long ago but they usually do class one patch than next patch is race or sometyhing else.  BC race WrathDK Catarace MOP classrace WoD Nothing.  But watching the trailer seems to try their hand at action combat.  Its needed I guess to try to appease poeple looking for that gameplay but due to tab target and all that idk if it will work as well as the other classes.  And see thru walls?  haha really?  Looks cool but why add tank class and not another healing class?  Curious about weapons and what they can use.Raids     WoW hasnt dropped every information about the expansion but wondering if the  raids will be at launch and add more or like WoD and  per patch.   total raids in  years is not good.  Wildstar has . in  year so far and I think the big reason they havent released the next tier is fact not alot of downed Avatus.  But LFR is a joke sorry thats my opinion yeah see content but really no achievement to the raid environment.  Its more of a single player with bunch of people.  The raids seem to be same stuff over and over  bosses than more bosses.  But dont see how you can change that winning formula idk.  Curious if they will keep how raids are in WoD or change them like they have done in the past with LFR vs hard modes vs flex vs mythic.  I do like how they are finally doing what players have been asking for a long time with Emerald Nightmare and Sargaras tomb.Dungeonssame ol same ol.  Theres really nothing new just more content but i dont know what people want when new content means more stuff to do.  Maybe if they didnt raise level and just added more content per expansion vs  patches with some new zones.  But they want their money.  They havent revealed everything but you would think they would drop the HUGE chanes at announcement not later.  Ill most likely get the game after a few months of release like I did for WoD and than level up and beat the game LFR and do all the dungeons in  weekends.  To easy imo maybe was jaded by Wildstar and the difficulty increasement vs other MMOs.  I hope they keep up the old raids and going and downing bosses by yourself I did enjoy that.But we dont know how well Wildstar will be come WoW expansion.  Blade and soul will be out and who knows how well that goes.  Also China could be a huge success just as FP can be.  NCSOFT is big in asian countries but alot of games are already there so dont have that crowd there.  Im curious US subscriptions vs wildstar.  Same for Europe.  Yes it will bring players there for a while but than again wont be for but a month or two.  To far out to tell imo,WildStar,ctuyfu6,1,t5_2sqwc

5047609,0,t3_3k1tto,This has been covered before.  This is not an early accessyour progress will continue to live type of environment.  I dont see the majority of the population wanting to pug dungeons on a beta server.  Maybe forming premades with players on live or in their guild.  Because progress will be wiped players arent going to beta servers for fun but to test out features of the game to find bugs before they get to live.The population on the beta servers consists of. Vets testing out their level  GADS raid builds and gearrune layouts.  They will be forming up GA and possibly DS raids to test that the new changes are balanced.  Same would go with vet dungeons premades more likely than PUG though.. People that got a closed beta key and are checking out the game.  These people are most likely going through the leveling process and if they decide to make it to level  then they could check out the first dungeon.  But since progress is going to be wiped and there are  classes to play as well as  factions many will want to check out the rest.  Also new people may not even be familiar enough with the LFG tool to even use it.We just had a character wipe last week so it will be even less likely to find new people doing normal dungeons on PTR.  I did see people asking around on LIVE for people to do PTR vet dungeons this past weekend.  Best way for you to get a group is join the PTRs LFG channel and ask in there and zone chat if anyone wants to run a dungeon.,WildStar,cuuff1w,1,t5_2sqwc

This isnt even fair anymore...This is when my silent Esper healing tears hit the pillow.Hes right of course becauseStats  Dont  Lie  In DS we dont stand out on individual boss encounters.In both GA and DS we are the last in tank healing second in group healing. Medics put us to shame on tanks even though we have all the single target abilities. Slingers destroy us on group healing.Even if you look at buffs our best ones PK Flame being the dagger in the heart get overwritten by random buffs from other classes due to bugs that havent been fixed in a year.Its hard to explain the frustration. You can have all of the talent in the world but as an Esper healer all of your efforts are to try not to embarrass yourself too badly when the Slingers start to do that thing they do so well. Or to desperately try to help the tank last another couple minutes and finish the fight when their medic goes down.Were the third wheel of the healing world on a yard sale tricycle.,WildStar,cv5l8vy,3,t5_2sqwc

5257178,0,t3_3n0a8x,Tbh people didnt want to pay before. Which means its not worth the price at all. They need to introduce lots of cosmetic and quality of life options at a cheap price to keep it going. People wont be dropping money on a game to feel good. Also the fact its a reboot and it was to save a failing game will hang in the back of their minds IE will it be worth to drop some cash on a game that basically failed first time round?  They need to show us all they can provide a solid game great communication decent updates and price a shop reasonable enough to entice people to spend money. Throwing some good looking costumes and such for like . or wicked mount for like . is what will generate the revenue. Coupled with the fact they need to retain a good sized player base which will further see people spend money.  Plenty FP games thrive you just need to find the balance.  Although you think its awesome it wasnt good enough for people to pay previously. And that still stands. They need to find a price people would pay for this. We will also if others do indeed find the game good  month from now and if it still has the population it has right now would be a good sign that the game will do well now.  There is a big climb ahead and I am sure they are working extra hard to make this happen! ,WildStar,cvjof3w,4,t5_2sqwc

5262365,0,t1_cvkbkw8,Yes I run other games with dx quite effectively actually thats the only reason why I started asking about the optimization to begin with.  From what I did get to experience while trying to run the game with dx the game in terms of latency was fine on my end strangely compared to what others have been saying.  The only real issue Im having is getting dx to work even getting only  frames on low settings would be enough to hold me over for the time being.  Judging by how smoothly even the login screen is with dx compared to dx I can tell Id likely be able to manage that.  As for the community I guess its not fair to judge the entirety of the game by the subreddit.  To be fair a few other games I enjoy have a lot of cancerous people on their subreddits too.  It just sort of shocked me that a game with population issues up until the relaunch would have players responding so aggressively to a potential new player joining the game.  The only thing that kept me away previously from Wildstar were the rumors of the population dwindling.  So when people started replying assuming Im some broke freeloader who wont support the game based on the fact I cant afford to replace my current PC its honestly just upsetting to me.  If I enjoy a game Ill gladly throw some money the developers way to support the game I always do. ,WildStar,cvkbq0o,1,t5_2sqwc

Although my standards may be lower than average I played WoW for way too long at ltfps when vanilla launched before I built myself a decent desktop. ForgeUI has helped make the UI more responsive on my laptop and if you really need the extra performance you can go through and try to disable many of the Carbine AddOns that you dont absolutely need.

Is rep used for something else now?. Items from quests are only good  of the time for me. I have several items of ilvl  that are stronger than ilvl  even if they feature the same types of stats. So Im getting rekt by monsters if I dont find these super items every now and then.

Also strikethrough helps get through deflect and excess strikethrough is converted into armor piercing. The anti shield mechanic is called overload. ,WildStar,cvtqfgb,1,t5_2sqwc

It is primarily just a matter of different types of hormones and physiology that makes females more attuned. Why? Thats not clear.And Id argue that male Aurin arent submissive necessarily. They are headstrong and impulsive and they consider themselves strong protectors. But they respect the wisdom and knowledge  and foresight sometimes literally  that female Aurin and especially the Matrias get from the Weave. That said this is definitely one species in the game where gender roles are often pretty stridently reinforced.

Everything else Ive crafted has been either  lower level just to unlock the next tier bought mats on broker to complete a craft at crazy broker prices crafted for tradeskill workorder leaving me with nothing for myself and a marginal number of currency for high level gear I wont be using for a couple weeks.The bit of coin I used to craft for work orders would have been better saved for now. On my nd char I have only made a few crafts using my mats and at lvl  I have over  plat saved. When I do spend time at  unlocking crafts Ill be able to do it all at once or at least much as I have to money to fund it.Im not saying dont do tradeskills.

UI is bullshit very unforgiving and confusing. I made a bad purchase and when i tried to get a refund support denied it and ppl in this subreddit told me how dumb i am for not reading the tooltip. Also ive been playing at least h a day since the game went FP and im still struggling with many UI options. Crafting takes ages to level up mats are scarce and bizarrely priced AdventuresShiphands are the most boring thing ive ever played in my life Leveling offers nothing new to the world of MMOs how can a game that came out a few years ago have worse leveling than present day WoW???

Imo the whole you need to buy  of this item and  of this item before even thinking of moving to raids is terrible.In general my problems with this game is that while it offers much innovation and i love the mechanics basic features are too much like old times WoW.

Pounce Tactical Retreat and Preparation are really good too. I only recommend Preparation when you can get the AMP Follow up though. Onslaught  Follow up are the AMPS that I would go for if I was you. What you will want to do is enter stealth before combat then just impale as often as you can then Press Analyze Weakness  Punish Then impale again as often as you can. Then cast Preparation and if you have Follow Up you will want to switch to tank stance and instantly back to DPS stance you can set this up in the keybinds. You should end up with another  or so suitpower to burn. Stealth again and impale until no more suit power. Use Punish when you get it and you are below  suitpower. When Punish and Preparation are on cooldown and you have no suit power for Impale just use Shred as much as you can. That is basically it for the start.With the other slots get as many interrupts as you can Priority list is Stagger gt Collapse gt False Retreat  FR sucks.,WildStar,cwccvoj,1,t5_2sqwc

5574997,0,t3_3rdi02, Sounds about right.  Im doing a couple write ups on feedback because as it stands deflect is meh and glance is terrible.  Runing for them is just a bad idea.  Im wanting to try putting in some glance for the T on the  runeset but as far as it looks it wont be super helpful. If youre hurting for crit mit then use Bulwark.  Its a lot of crit mit and considering crits are  it should cover any gaps Hardy isnt a bad choice after your gear and runesets push you over crit mit by default.  Mountain in chest is reliable and cheap so Id definitely pick it up for a while.  For boots some people like Hut Hut Hike.  Personally I like using Steadfast the ones that keep you from getting slowed while sprinting if you get hit like the amp in the bottom tree a little cheaper to rune for as well. Thats just personal preference. For gloves it depends.  You could bring the utility to raid with equipping true strike or shredder but your DPS will usually have both.  You can use menace which is an instant  threat whenever you start attacking.  I use enrage which is  threat and  damage increase after getting hit three times.  It pretty much pushes your threat up by about  after the first three hits.  Some like Menace but I prefer Enrage because of the overall damage increase though small and the higher threat ceiling it provides. The T is a must for energized arms.  Its really strong and should stay in your character once you get it.  The T is nice at first but once you get the T for your ilvl  rune set it becomes a balance game.  Some fights you can have  abilities T Jolt and T Shieldburst to do a threat rotation others youll only have .  On Gloomclaw I run a PL build so I only have about  then.  Its nice but its not something youll always be able to take advantage of at least if you want to bring more utility. Personally Ive been avoiding using it just because my threats not really an issue were still progressing in DS and our dps outgear me.  It seems to be an increase but nothing huge. Focus on runing out any DPS in your guild before taking the T. For ilvl  dont break the bank with runes.  Lower runes are better than no runes and youll be replacing gear pretty quick so dont waste the money.,WildStar,cwo4ox0,1,t5_2sqwc

Its totally normal it happens all the time in MMOs. On the other hand I would love more classes to utilize sustained damage such as DoTs and Bleeds. Warlock is my favorite class from WoW and I transitioned to the Spellslinger nicely with its DoTs but I just wish those mechanics were more widespread to the other classes. As for areas to improve in I really would like a complete overhaul of the default UI. Its just a complete mess and its singlehandedly turned off a lot of my friends who I tried to get into the game. I use plenty of addons but I dont like using UI addons for personal reasons. Theres just WAY too much information on screen the quest log is too messy and theres too many menustabs. I wish they would consolidate more like they did with the Character Page where it removed a lot of tabs and had the main info on the default page.Theyve fixed a lot of my previous issues such as rune and cloth drops but the only other thing I think they can improve on is optimization and server lag.,WildStar,cx7fh8r,2,t5_2sqwc

Theres some support skills that also do damage as well as heal so in that case does support rating increase that damage or decrease cool downs?

You display progression by looks achievements mounts not power.You have been spoiled by some perversion of what an RPG is in the recent generation of the genre but RPG has a lot more than just stat progression to it. Stat progression was just ONE way of conveying character growth. Role playing story developments feats aesthetic customization etc have also been staples of RPGs for a long time and unfortunately WoW has abandoned all semblance and support of the role playing and immersive experience in favor of the carrot on a stick style of marketing that is the gear treadmill.I dont take prideenjoyment if I win PvP matches because I curbstomped people massively disadvantaged against me anymore than I enjoy winning a basketball match against a team of special needs children.,WildStar,cxh52qo,-1,t5_2sqwc

The threat bonus from T Jolt allows you to spam your intimidate and polarity field which means more jolts to keep the bonus threat up from T Vanguard and also overlaps Jolt T debuff.  It also frees up an LAS slot which means you have a lot of room to give utility to your raid andor tankiness to yourself with something like plasma wall.,WildStar,cxo95s4,1,t5_2sqwc

6030671,0,t1_cy9wwnc,This list assumes that youre in a raid where everyone is on the same skill and gear level. It also assumes you have class sets and squeeze as much DPS out of the classes as possible. This scenario is not realistic as theres only  guilds in the world where these requirements are met looking at equally skilled especially. In most raids youll be top damage because you heavily outskill everyone else which creates the illusion that a weak class is really strong in some guilds so most people youre gonna talk to will give you wrong information about class balance because theyre ignorant trust me on this it happens all the time no matter how nice the guy youre talking to is. WarriorgtMediocre damage heavy armor melee has a full DPS and a buffbitch spec both are fun to play best interrupts in the game one of the best leaps in the game Defense Grid creates area where everyone receives less damage and overall nice and useful utility for the raid very nice burst. Overall one of the best classes for endgame raiding. Engineergt Mediocre damage heavy armor ranged has a strong single target and a rather weak AoE spec once you have the class set you can have a s interrupt ridiculous and s AoE snares no leap but lots of dashes and nothing can really oneshot you has Code Red which reduces damage for your raid on phases where your boss doesnt attack anyone happens more often than you think absolutely ridiculous burst on AoE and extremely strong burst on single target. Class is underpopulated and the rotation is very easy to play. EspergtBad damage once everyone has class sets light armor ranged and melee also you want to stand still a lot for higher DPS output has a weak ranged spec fun to play and a stronger melee spec aids to play is weak on AoE but stronger on single target worst interrupts in the game worst leap in the game excluding Engi who has no real leap no other good raid utility except the obligatory cleanse ability no real burst compared to bursty classes but also loses on consistent damage against burst classes. Overall one of those classes that you ideally want  in the raid at max for the Storm and Pyrokinetic Flame debuffbuff. Esper Healers are garbage. SpellslingergtBad damage once everyone has class sets light armor ranged has a very RNG DPS spec and a buffbitch spec interrupts are one of the worse your leap is one of your interrupts which can create some pretty shitty situations obligatory cleanse ability Void Slip can be nice for certain raid mechanics jew them has raid utility as useful as Esper so not really anything no real burst because half of your damage is DoTs and the other half is bursty if you spec into a fullburst spec your consistent damage will completely rip. Slinger Healers are gods in raids Slinger DPS is one of those classes that you want like  in your raid max for certain buffs theres some ranged cleave fights where Slingers shine but those are rare and theyre easily doable without that. MedicgtMediocre damage on single target best class on AoE medium armor meleesemiranged has a really strong spec and a weaker spec that you use for when you need lots of utility and buffs one of the best interrupters in the game best leap in the game obligatory cleanse ability nice raid utility overall with field probes  never ending slow fields etc. has little to no burst. Class is one of the best classes for endgame raiding even though they have no real burst. Medic Healers are pretty good and always nice to have. StalkergtRidiculous damage medium armor melee very short range you also want to DPS from behind the boss as much as possible which can complicate things has a broken singleduo target spec and a pretty strong AoE spec you dont really play it anywhere except maybe some dungeon fights though good interrupts but Stalkers are usually the class that goes full DPS due to their strength leap can be shitty on some fights due to adds making it unpredictable and annoying on most fights its really nice though doesnt have all that much raid utility overall absolutely retard broken burst and damage in general once you have class sets not so much in AoE though but those are rare in WS raiding. Overpopulated because theyre FotM right now since they dont really sacrifice their DPS by using utility they can be less wanted than other classes even though theyre so strong.,WildStar,cya50q3,2,t5_2sqwc

However to use the assault tree I lost a good amount of mitigation and sustainability which would make an easier job for my healers which you can now use cause your dps and threat were just buffed.

Progressing through DS also got a lot easier because of all the changes that FP brought into existance like additional power creep new runesystem  itemization increased maxhp on all players and much more. So since FP i would say DS is difficulty wise like GA and GA is like doing dungeons.Its kinda amusing how you really believe you accomplished something special. Its non of my business what people think of themselfs but when you start bragging about it my alaram bell rings. I can only remember  times when guilds did something extraordinary in terms of raid performance and truely accomplished something other guilds thought wouldnt be possible at that point in time Eugenic killing prenerf Gloomclaw in DS which was declared unkillable  RIP Voodoo xD Enigma killing FireLife elemental pairs world first in DS after several fixes... but still it was huge!

6324391,0,t3_4265oq,Hey there!Just started the game the first time since the Beta. I love the graphic style and atmosphere but feel like the story is...not really too important. Very little voiced dialogues entire talks seem to go by without me noticing while Im busy slaughtering enemies.Im already near a point where I want to simply skip any and all dialogue and only stop to read the text boxes if its necessary.So...what do you think? Will I be missing out if I do that? Will Wildstar enchant me with a rich narrative further into the game? How did you like it?,WildStar,cz8ij6y,1,t5_2sqwc
6344239,0,t1_czari7o,Agreed but its not just  for a lot of people. This game has been out for over a year and many people have alts.

6918734,0,t3_4ai5u3,They would probably make a lot just by adding more decor andor bringing back limited edition decorspacks like Halloween Christmas etc.. Many have suggested those not even be limited edition. I know I would have purchased every single one if I had not been busy during the time the actual events were on or if they were still available now. Costumes pets dyes mounts and all those cosmetic type of things should always be included imo because people will buy them endlessly and they dont really effect the game negatively. The account bound vs character bound thing is really shit on a few items in the store so perhaps they could do better with that. Im sure lots of people dont purchase simply because some items feel like a rip off when only character bound. I dont think level boosts are a good idea even though they are an easy way to make a big chunk of money. Wildstar is a steep learning curve for some people after playing other MMOs and I would say leveling to  at least once is a very good idea. So maybe it could be implemented but with a condition like you must already have one max level toon. That way it also wont effect the lower level populations as much hopefully which are important to be at least semipopulated when new players are trying the game. Im unsure how hard it would be to actually implement but perhaps a music system like LOTRO would go down well where players can use instruments to play music. You could either put in preset files that others had prepared to play songs any song from IRL or whatever on your ingame lute flute etc. You can also individually control notes to create your own or imitate other songs. Seems like something that would probably go down well with a lot of the RP and Housing community as well as the general player base. I know in Lotro most enjoyed having a go at it. And maybe some bigger bags. ,WildStar,d10k8ei,3,t5_2sqwc

6930726,0,t3_4am1qm,Warrior is one of the most sought after DPS in end game raids simply because they have so much more to offer than just being top of the deeps chart and they can do that just fine as well. Defense Grid is incredibly useful. And is commonly run in DPS set ups for many bosses even though it offers no dps what so ever and is entirely a defensive skill. The only issue I have with Warrior is that there is only one build for DPS and that is to spam Rampage as often as you can. I personally have a lot of fun swinging my giant sword around and Rampage just so happens to be one of the best looking skills Warrior has so I guess its not so bad but  you can only do RSx gt WW gt Ramp  Breach gt R gt WW gt Ramp gt Savage  Breach gt T gt Ramp or some other variation of that so many times before you start to feel it. ,WildStar,d11x8n6,2,t5_2sqwc

Since DPS requirements are pretty strict in this strategy waiting to DPS can cause issues with laser placement during transitions. Im not  sure if this may have motivated some of the build choices for Toasted or JB but I thought I should clarify this a bit.

7577891,0,t1_d33hj3k,I played in the first year since launch. I wouldnt say the endgame content was ever too little or bland in fact we were ranked somewhere around top  guilds when I left and we werent even halfway done with DS.What made myself and other guildies quit was  poor itemization the guy in charge of that even stated that he didnt know what he was doing and just kind of gave items random stats. In the first half year the best raiding gear was fully crafted blues with maxed out main stats. Balance issues. It seemed like balance patches came out like once every  or so months and all they would do is switch whoever the OP class is. There always seemed to be one or two classes which were  dps above the rest. Similar for heals. Bugs wouldnt get fixed soon enough. My esper friend had to heal for months without seeing his telegraphs then for weeks without us being able to see his telegraphs. As a spellslinger for months my dps depended on bugging out the igniteassassinate combo to boost my dps even with that spellslinger was the lowest dps.Those are just my main issues there were other things like the game becoming a chore having to do a swarm of repetative dailies every day issues with PvP. The game was just riddled with small to medium issues that just added up and chipped away at your enjoyment the more you played and the more you learned the game.This was like a year ago so I cant say much about the current state of the game,WildStar,d33kj3n,14,t5_2sqwc
7638721,0,t1_d3adtsf,This is a bullshit answer. While I dont disagree that a guild might have helped to alleviate some of these issues the core issue here at least in my opinion is that while WS has some of the best content out there its incredibly difficult to actually experience rather than get carried through it.If he joined a guild what would be different about being carried through dungeons? Sure you might get a bit more of an explanation of the fights but its more likely youre just going to be shown the cheese method of beating it due to power creep. The same goes for Genetic Archives and likely most of Datascape. If you join an established guild theyre going to carry you to the point that theyre at. Established guilds arent looking to bring on players so they can experience the game theyre looking to boost their numbers so they can hit the content they havent managed to beat yet. Leveling is the same. Join a guild and you might be able to convince someone to come give you a hand on some lowbie quest real quick but its unlikely youre going to find someone willing to level with you most of the time. And sure leveling is super fast now  hours lolololol. Thats all good and well but it doesnt allow a new player to experience the game. This is why  years without new content is a death sentence for an mmo. Veteran players outgear nearly everything and new players are sort of forced to just piggyback and get carried through content thats new to them but trivial for the people theyre running with. Thats just not an enjoyable experience for most people. Theres no sense of accomplishment nothing to really work towards. ,WildStar,d3ahac9,1,t5_2sqwc

You can find yourself a crafter or two to make you at least the master complex gear  ilvl up to   if not the more advanced more expensive gear if you are unlucky with AH CX .  You can also grind World Bosses for ilvl  and last but not least grind Arcterra content for ilvl  . You can mix amp match of course all the previous methods   Keep advertising yourself and ask for alt raids in the guilds or alt pug raids . Main hardcore raiding can come a week or two later  depending on your luck with loot and of course your performance in those raids . I have seen people be able to raid after a day or two and others after couple weeks or so .  I am all for an advanced group finder that includes raids but hopefully without nerfing them . In any case besides my personal feelings on this such a tool could be a great boost for more casual  more alt friendly  more newcomers friendly or something for the game and I am pretty sure  tons of people will love it and hate it at the same time P,WildStar,d3z5j7y,2,t5_2sqwc

If I am correct then that would mean that  Crit Rating is equal to  Crit Hit Chance. I am curious to know if that applies for all stats? Also my other point was the  bonuses you get from rune sets. Lets say you have  Crit Hit chance without the Devastation rune set. If you apply the set bonus of . after you equip itignoring the stats from the runes does that mean you will have . Crit Hit Chance or will this percentage take your  Crit Rating and add  Crit Rating resulting in you having  Crit Rating which woud be around . Crit Hit Chance? I am asking this because it is less than  either way. And the lvl normal runes give  Crit Rate which is equal to ? Does that mean that the rune set bonuses are important for minmaxing but arent really necessaryClass sets aside for like  of the dmg you will do?EDIT I noticed in your spreadsheet that theres a list with all the stats and the correpsonding value for  which answers my first question. Thanks for the spreadsheet!Cheers,WildStar,d5800vd,1,t5_2sqwc

8265493,0,t1_d5ae8bn,I have actually played through wow and completed every quest. Never once has a quest been bugged for more then a day before being fixed. Sure other mmos have bugged quests but they all get fixed relatively quickly. As far as i can tell some of wildstars quests have been bugged for quite a while without a fix or even communication from the devs that a fix is being worked on. Simply having bugged quests isnt a problem but a dev that doesnt make fixing bugged quests a priority is a problem. Especially when those bugged quests are experienced by new players in the first  minutes of gameplay. Great way to get new players to stop playing your game.,WildStar,d5aqsxr,1,t5_2sqwc

8960865,0,t3_530pvv,Hey welcome to Wildstar!ampnbspFirst of all please be aware that when you download the game over steam you can only play over steam. Your account will not work when using the standalone client unless support decouples the account.ampnbspSecondly I recommend you enable step authentication on your account. This will bypass the stupid IP verification that Carbine has put in place. When you enable step authentication for your account please make sure you save the special code that is generated when enabling it. You will need it if you ever lose your authentication app.ampnbspMost importantly when playing  have fun!A lot of people forget to have fun in this game and try to rush or force things in the game. I recommend you join the LFGGlobal channels depending on which server youre joining. Depending on your playstyle and preferences the official global channel might be too noisycrowded for you.ampnbspTry to find a guild as well. Theres a lot of guilds out there that welcome new people and will help you out. Plus it makes the game a lot more fun to play.ampnbspLearn the importance of properly interupting abilities during your encounters. This is basic mechanic that will save your life and make a lot of the content easier to deal with when mastered.ampnbspMount!

Nah sorry.  If people piss me off I just walk away especially on the internet.On the other hand when people are blatantly making fools of themselves it amuses me so I continue to reply.  And since you have stated you didnt actually read the whole conversation saying he isnt trolling because you see no evidence of it in past posts is pretty weak isnt it?And you can take me saying youre hilarious as something dickish all you want.  Again for me it was just honesty.  I read that and laughed for real so it was obviously hilarious.Frankly you seem to be pretty damn intelligent.  But when you jump to conclusions like this person isnt trolling because I have read past posts and he doesnt seem to troll is kind of mind boggling.  Do you know if he has other reddit logins?  Do you know if he trolls on other forums?  No you dont.  Judging current posts tones based on previous posts tones is pointless.As to lazily ignorant no.  I dont care about his past posts and whether or not he has been trolling or not.  The fact that he is trolling now is what  matters.  Condescending?  No honesty.  If you take honesty of condescension that is on you not on me.  Dislike him?  No I dont care about him.  He is a faceless nobody in the sea of filth that is reddit.  He matters about as much to me as the ant I stepped on this morning.What logic isnt holding up?  I know you dont mean mine.But whatever.  If you arent going to do your job that is fine dont do it.

10698391,0,t3_5t005v,Personal Telegraphs while I agree its up to the player if you start messing up you may not notice.Healing Telegraphs as a healer I would be very mad if someone disabled their heals. That means I would have to individually heal them. I know many heals have visuals however the heal Im thinking of is the Esper heal Soothe. Its an instant cast after charging however there is not animation before the cast. If you dont see the telegraph you wont be able to help the healer get you healed. Now Id have to either waste a Soothe on you because you didnt move into the telegraph or waste a Bolster on you.Enemy Buff these can be incredibly important to track. If you let a mob get a buff it can heavily swing a fight not in your favor. Plus theyre incredibly infrequent so its not like youre cluttering your screen.,WildStar,ddjgjti,1,t5_2sqwc

10875446,0,t1_de1i2sb,Different people will give you different answers. Some will tell you dungeons are good. Others will tell you this game has plenty to do as a nonraider. I would be in the latter camp. With the soontocome patch this will become even more. I would say this game will not leave you bored if you have low time to play. You will have plenty to do and you are unlikely to feel you have no time for everything most likely.Try it for yourself. Worst case scenario you now know for sure!,WildStar,de1q3ru,5,t5_2sqwc

10952737,0,t3_5wfhys,Arcterra is the new daily zone youll find a teleport in your capital city. You should also pick up contracts from the board in the city which you usually complete by doing dailiesworld bossesdungeons. These give various levels of rewards and will be your highest available gear outside of raids. The dungeon finder tool is rarely used so I suggest looking for a guild to run content with or LFG in nexus chat. ,WildStar,de9p3qu,2,t5_2sqwc

10963925,0,t1_deabb37,Im not saying theyre asking to remove unique setrunes. Im saying theyre asking to remove one of the things that keeps these runes balanced.Would it be fair to complain that item slots are too confusing and dont add depth so we should just remove those too? Because thats basically what were doing here. Were complaining that item slots for runes are too confusingdont add enough depth to be worth it.,WildStar,deauo4f,1,t5_2sqwc

11001561,0,t3_5x0hxz,Warrior augmented blade is sort of similar. You turn it on and it starts draining your energy to give you damage but  it ramps up and then you have to turn it off manually or run out of energy. You get a lot of bonuses for having  or more kinetic energy so its less about going into supermode and maintaining it and more about maximizing the modes use by strategically turning it on and off to burn off your extra KE without burning too much.,WildStar,deeztgw,5,t5_2sqwc

11106047,0,t3_5ykrtg,I recommend you to go to the Arcterra daily zone and do the events and bosses around there to practice so you get familiar with your class.There is also a runecrafting guide up on this sub reddit now that covers the basics highly recommend to read thru it.You have a bank which you can add bags to for storage ask any guard in Illium or Thayd and you will be directed there.Once you are a bit familiar with your class and have some basic runes setup your next step is to start to queue for dungeons.,WildStar,deqv01x,2,t5_2sqwc

11190858,0,t1_df0bo89,Heres three of the responses i gotNumber gtI tried to search our logs since the last time you logged in last year up to present but did not get any results. There is a possibility that because of the recent updates and changes in Wildstar the logs were now irretrievable. Because of that I tried to ask for a screenshot of your character using the mount back then. This is to prove that your character once had the item but disappeared for some reason. However if you have no screenshots in the past Im afraid I wont be able to restore the item to your account.Number gtI can confirm though that you have purchased Fortune Coins in the past and this might be the method of how you obtained the item. But regarding the SpiderRider unfortunately we have no way of retrieving it since we have no longer have any records.Number gtI do understand your frustration about this matter however we are unable to restore your SpiderRider since we cannot locate it in our records. Also we are unable to refund your Fortune Coins since you have already used it and we cannot redo the changes applied to your account. And of course after every replygtI know that this is not the answer you are looking for but we can only ask for your understanding.,WildStar,df0gy8s,1,t5_2sqwc

I completed significantly less of the matrix than many of the grinders I was at  heroism and I know some people got to almost  because this was the only way Id stay playing the game  if there was a way around hours of mindless grinding.,WildStar,dg6aa03,3,t5_2sqwc
