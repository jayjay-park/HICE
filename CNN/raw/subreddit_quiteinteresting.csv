The episodes are in order.. over the last several years Ive done the random thing a few times and surprisingly to me the majority of users really complained about it.  So I keep it in order.   Though to the other comments on finding all the episodes.  One thing I did work on was making sure I had every episode.. even the rare ones like the charity events pilot episode and some episodesseasons are were just not easy to find especially in a wide screen ratio of any kind.  I have the highest quality of the episodes possible.  Obviously the older early s episodes are significantly lower quality than the newer.  The XL uncutentended length episodes didnt start till the thth season or so.  But come on over to  or Vaughn and if you ever want to watch a particular episode or have a request I always honor what those in chat ask for.. ie Will you play  episodes of this or that.  If it hasnt been played too recently Ill play a whole season or more out of order if asked.

3737291,0,t1_cqi7zrl,I understand that but in order for it to be pitched and have a pilot it has to have an appeal for an audience a network feels would cater to the audience of their type of programming.
