Ive compounded upon the skills I learned in boy scouts and it has shown me my path in life for my long term career which is becoming an Emergency Manager.  Honestly I wouldnt give it up for anything.,searchandrescue,clt2h81,2,t5_2t9zp

Hence we also assist with crime scene searches  ie canvassing large wilderness rural and urban areas for cadavers casings weapons clothing etc. Crime scene training is mandatory for all unit members basically just  hour of a deputy from the major crimes unit telling us to not disturb anything on a crime scene ever.,searchandrescue,cs2200w,2,t5_2t9zp

For paid users I hooked this up with Twilio so the entire thing works online with no cell phones. The operator has a record of the entire conversation and can track the path of a subject if they are moving.Heres an article on a recent rescue facilitated by the application,searchandrescue,d2akh8u,1,t5_2t9zp

If you wear your regular helmet you dont have comms or a full face shield. As a result none of us own flight helmets.,searchandrescue,daa0mob,1,t5_2t9zp
