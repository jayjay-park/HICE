8308082,0,t1_d5g1x9k,Once during her last phase she straight up shot me without charging it first and it was my last health bar. Thanks The Burst.,Furi,d5g2ewb,1,t5_3acls
8356028,0,t1_d5lvdh6,god i love the edge. but i hate the star. i dont mind the bullet hell but the bean just sucked since it covered the bosses projectiles and its the only way of killing it. and im never ever doing the star on furier difficulty again. ever.,Furi,d5m216g,1,t5_3acls
8371136,0,t1_d5ntxe4,Yeah Ive been trying to do that in concept but its tricky. Just need to git gud I suppose.Definitely trying again today.,Furi,d5nxx83,1,t5_3acls

Lets say the prototype for what became the Rider. Ultimately I could be wrong but I doubt they made them look so similar just to mess with the players.In addition I believe the other rider clones are mortal or at least prone to be destroyed because if theyre not then when you destroy The Star theyd just fall on earth and continue corrupting just like you resulting in a bad ending despite winning. Finally if you walk around youll noticed that even rocks and houses are ruined when you get close so I doubt anywhere on the planet would be safe from The Riders harm. The only place has to be the prison at least from what weve seen. Maybe a new prison created by The Voice? We know hes the architect so wouldnt it be easy for him to create a safe space for The Rider? ,Furi,d5vzj47,1,t5_3acls
