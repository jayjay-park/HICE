377683,0,t1_cfjqshm,Linville Gorge and Mt. Mitchell are fantastic hikes. Just make sure you dont get lost in the Gorge as its pretty easy to do if you dont do your research beforehand. ,NCTrails,cfjwuu3,3,t5_2urj4

3015039,0,t3_2u8p59,I picked up disc golf when in college down there. Castle Haynes park has an awesome  hole course that is very wooded an fun as hell. Can also bring dogs and beer! At least last time I was there.  There are some hiking trails outside of Goldsboro at cliffs of the Neuse state park that were nice also. Some nice walking loops around wrightsville beach and greenfield lake downtown also but they are paved.,NCTrails,coai9on,1,t5_2urj4

5732958,0,t3_3r42qm,I go Hiking in the winter on Mt mitchell and grandfather mountain. Its  doable you just have to be really prepared for anything We got stuck on a horse trail and could not go back up because snow started coming down so hard. luckily we were prepared for camping and set a fire and camped out for the night and waited for the snow to blow over. ,NCTrails,cx7q9o6,1,t5_2urj4
8724962,0,t3_4zhyz1,Craggy gardens is kind of cool probably not that secluded in prime leafing season though. Maybe upper creek falls its a little closer to you and has a little less traffic.,NCTrails,d6w9g46,2,t5_2urj4
9248473,0,t3_570vq4,Skip the Smokies. You want views go to Grayson Highlands in Virginia. Youll sacrifice dramatic waterfalls but gain amazing views wild ponies and no crowds.,NCTrails,d8ob8kf,6,t5_2urj4
10236814,0,t1_dbzjpr6,haha me too... were on the same adventure...

10720366,0,t1_ddli01q,Just to add to the above. The rain less summerfall left many springs dry.  Some are still just barely a trickle. Take precautions with expected spring ho. ,NCTrails,ddlq5wq,2,t5_2urj4
