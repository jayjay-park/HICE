245438,0,t1_cf66l1a,Dude its so OBVIOUSLY fucking photoshopped.The camera would have to focus on the lense or the eyelashes not both at the same time so therefore one MUST be blurry for the other to be crisp.The pupil will never reflect this perfectly. Its essentially just a hole in your eye.Where are the lens specs?The eyelashes the lens and the HANDS HOLDING THE CAMERA  are all in focus. optically impossible.On top of the fact the ring on the finger has a crisp reflection in it. An eye will not reflect an absolute perfect image like that this is something Id see on CSI Miami. Secondly eyes are round and will warp any image reflected in it a little. That camera being held none the less and not static would not be able to focus perfectly in the eye and have crisp detail of objects in the room hands and camera itself. All this photo bleeds bullshit.And the goddamn lens just does not fit in at all. Its not reflected by the eye  its just fucking there.

398441,0,t1_cflzns6,Id personally recommend the cokin system as long as you dont buy the cheap low end filters.  The cheap ones cause color casts.  Benefits of the cokin system are that if you buy the adapter for your lens you can use the same filter across all your lenses up to a certain point.  I had invested in basic cokin system then found a guy on craigslist dumping his entire collection.  End up getting every adapter for both major sizes and just about every filter they make for   bucks.  You can make finds like that if you keep a lookout.  ,itookapicture,cfm2bjy,1,t5_2r1tc

551575,0,t3_20ek4u,Well to be fair Macro does not mean up close but the ability to focus on small granular detail. Many Macro lenses are not  true to life so extension tube notwithstanding this still doesnt serve the same purpose as a macro lens. You can actually get a macro effect by turning many zoom lenses around setting the camera to manual and taking a photo. Canon makes a  Macro mm f. for  and Nikon makes one for . Additionally most macro photographers do not use auto focus  you can buy an old lens such as the Canon mm F Macro for around  an adapter for  and have substantially better results if youre aiming for Macro. Good extension tubes arent cheap and cheap extension tubes significantly increase light fall off chromatic aberrations and overall image quality.,itookapicture,cg2yy4i,1,t5_2r1tc

The climbing world needs more Fight Club And this is coming from someone who loves it.John Long got it right when he pointed out that Were talking about climbing rocks after all.gt Its OK for people to marvel at that.Far be it for me to tell people what they can and cant be curious about. God knows Ive answered my share of questions and held innumerable impromptu educational sessions with tourists on hiking trails at the base of climbs. Its expected that people confronted with an unknown will be interested in knowing more. Climbers should know better. Again were getting to the top of a hill the stupid way. For fun. Thats all. We all take various levels of emotional spiritual physical social and mental satisfaction from the process and that cannot be faulted.

2793494,0,t3_2s2scb,Forgotten Future  iPhone Ive been busy in the city and on my way I noticed that it was quite misty around the skyscrapers in Frankfurt. This is perfect conditions for my project called Urban Abstractions. Unfortunately I left my camera at home. But fortunately I had my iPhone  ready. Im into mobile photography anyway so that wasnt that much of a problem for me. Actually some of my best works are shot with my iPhone. Shot with iPhones Camera App. Processed with VSCOcam x preset. I adjusted brightness and contrast added more grain and a touch of sharpness in VSCO as well. Straightened slightly not that much with iPhones photos app. The concept accomplished in this shot is actually not new to me. I knew the spot and went straight to it. Architecture is a fundamental element of my work used as instrument to embody my thoughts. The works from my ongoing Urban Abstractions series are all ideally connected. Just as all works in this series theyre clearly minimalistic in their appearance with a resembling geometrical impact. Theyre reflecting the uncertainty about the future regarding human progression and evolvement as the ever growing highrise buildings vanish into the sky. I achieve these perspectives by going very close to these highrise buildings. By close I mean VERY close. My iPhone actually touches the surface of the building lens pointing to the sky. As these shots are thanks to the perspectives very abstract anyway I try to enhance abstraction by post processing further more. In this case by overblowing the sky and loosing details in the dark parts. For the sky I didnt had to do much because of the mist I talked about in the beginning.,itookapicture,cnllyoz,1,t5_2r1tc

I used a tube and a half of Ion Color Brilliance in Lavender and a little squirt of the darker Violet in Ion just so it would make it a little darker and last longer. Mix it with suave hair conditioner then I usually leave it on my hair for about  to  hours. If your ends look dry rub argan oil on them! I hope that helps. D,itookapicture,cpbyhsk,7,t5_2r1tc

4678045,0,t1_ctk0y5b,Ive never been to Malibu so Im not sure but I think this place is a part of Century Dam I looked it up on google maps and the nature is similar. Also from above  you can see that the that there is water reaching out to both ends from the dam making it possible that this place would be there. Unfortunately there are no street views good enough to confirm it.But I have no idea maybe the nature is completely the same all over Malibu and I just wasted time. ,itookapicture,ctk7sa8,1,t5_2r1tc

4777957,0,t1_ctwsk7r,Your approach is fine. The shutter speed is very fast which requires the ISO to be really high for the camera to get a bright enough exposure which adds some noise to the shot. The focus issue is not going to be easy to overcome. The depth of focus is controlled by aperture and the aperture is going to need to be opened up pretty wide to allow for enough exposure when the shutter is this fast. You cant have it all high shutter speed low ISO and closed aperture. So if the depth of focus is going to be fairly small youre going to have a lot of slightly out of focus shots. Just gotta take a LOT of shots and hope you get lucky on a few. I do find that if i shoot in RAW and edit in Lightroom I can lower the ISO and close down the aperture a bit resulting in a darker image and still bring the exposure up brighter in post editing. This results in a little less noise a little greater depth of focus while still using a fast shutter speed. Lightroom can bring a very dark RAW image up a long way.....,itookapicture,ctwsx0a,1,t5_2r1tc

5415676,0,t3_3p7x93,I agree about the noise photo editing software can help with that and also adjusting your ISO. Additionally I think the foreground is rather dark so if youre shooting in manual try bringing down your aperture to allow for more light in the shot. Also dark shots like this can work but you get a silhouette effect so Id suggest the subject pull their hair back so you could see a sharper cleaner profile as I think that would make the overall effect stronger. Good start! ,itookapicture,cw3wtj6,0,t5_2r1tc

5745673,0,t1_cx8yuql,Thanks . There was photoshop involved put it was only to get rid of some things poking into the frame. I think even if you see them it wont be enough context for you to see how it was shot. This was shot between two buildings and in front of me there are stairs which is where the family are at the top of.  Between the buildings they have cables connecting each other for some lights installation and they are the cables you see in the photo. Thats about it. The bird was a lucky coincidence . ,itookapicture,cx9b203,1,t5_2r1tc

6350493,0,t1_czbfl10,Sure. the reason I use the adapter is I was a Canon person for years and have grown a fairly big arsenal of glass. When the as came out the camera did everything I needed for my style of shooting so the switch was a no brainer for me as I didnt really love the D bulky heavy not great in low light no variable frame rates in video CF card. But i really did love all my glass that I had. So I went with the adapter. The most expensive adapter was also a speed booster to give me even more low light capabilities. Essentially I was building a super camera for low light. And it works great. All my . are  even. My . are  even. Focusing becomes way harder if you are that open but to have the light there is worth the possibility of softness. One major draw back with using any adapter is autofocusing. It will either be slow or disabled. Its never really effected me much as I dont use autofocus. But you still maintain all of the other electronic capabilities through the sensor. ,itookapicture,czbhb3y,13,t5_2r1tc

Not to judge a photo by its lack of failures but you dont have any haloing you dont have anything glowing and your lights and darks are relative.  It might still get screenshotted and posted on rshittyHDR  but fuck it you put in work for this shot and while it might not have the contrast that were looking for you set a goal for this shot and accomplished it.

8682604,0,t1_d6qxcxo,I decided almost as soon as a build for the Ti became available but it was just an early release  beta sort of thing and it never evolved from that. To be honest Im not sure what features are a part of it and what arent Id probably be confused if you handed me a stock Ti. There are a lot of bugs to work out that probably wont ever be worked out since the Ti is outdated. I think you can manage just fine with the stock firmware but sometimes its nice to have the focus peaking  zebras as well as exposure override when Im trying to judge my exposure when using macro tubes. I have used the intervalometer feature too which is nice. However I dont think theres anything I couldnt live without. For this camera with Magic Lanterns limited capability I wouldnt highly recommend it. Apparently theres more that it can do with some other cameras and maybe it would be useful for them. As far as post processing Im sort of eager to see what else I can do too! Having always tried to make my pictures look as real as possible Im now realizing that sometimes it can be fun to give them a more dramatic or stylized look hopefully while more or less avoiding instagram filter complaints. It should be fun to see different styles and to learn when and why they could be used versus a more natural look. Edit Regarding your first point I have to say As much as I dream about gear upgrades I know that first and foremost my technique both shooting and in post needs improvement. That will see the most dramatic results.,itookapicture,d6qy8as,2,t5_2r1tc

Plus I was playing around with the temperature settings. Im on mobile now but could get that info later if requested. In general Ive found that anything longer than  seconds on a mm full frame results in some star trails especially around the edges. I usually use my mm . Rokinon at  sec and  but Ive had to stop down to  on it for better sharpness with the focusing issues Ive had with it. ,itookapicture,d82c28g,2,t5_2r1tc
