11312005,0,t1_dfe2k7y,I cant help you regarding your Mac but the tools needed for your Raspberry are installed along Hugin. Check that on your Mac.Both are Unix systems but Im not sure if the commands will be  the same.Ive been quite successful automating the process so you can do it. Good luck. Edit find some command e.g nona and use the entire path for every command. Itd my guess but I have  experience with macs. ,Hugin,dfe75a2,1,t5_31sd8
