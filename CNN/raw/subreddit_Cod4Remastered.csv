9463330,0,t3_5adb8v,M for assault rifle. Easily the best gun in the game  shot burst weapon.  burst usually kills  for longer ranges.  Its the starting weapon. Ak is also good. Sub is the mp great with red dot and stopping power. I use that until the p is unlocked then cause havoc with the p juggernaut combo. Mp is the starting weapon. The first sniper is a beast also especially with a cog. Hope I helped I gamed this for thousands of hours. ,Cod4Remastered,d9fjkyb,1,t5_3edd2

9578955,0,t3_5c5eyl,I would say you are still probably better then the majority of snipers I come accross but some of the clips are a bit inconstitent with accuracy some you left in for humour reasons such as the initial clip with the knife kill but you do lack abit of confidence. True on a map like crossfire it is important to be aware firstly for the spawn trap behind and to guard the stairs secondly to not stay in the window at all times for fear of being sniped! But the fact still remains you can still move around a bit more. Some of your best shots are from spawn and that shows that your reaction times are good. On a map like crossfire you can move through each of the buildings after a few kills so you have a change of position and you dont have to worry so much about random spawns. Also moving away from the window to soon can be a big issue for carrying on those later killstreaks. If you move away from the window and stop covering a corner or window that may allow another player to set up shop and hard scope your position killing you the minute you move out of cover which I assume happened after most of these shots. True you seemed to handle your self well but it did look like slow unfruitful gameplay a bit of movement and aggression may help get you more kills and maybe speed up your progression.,Cod4Remastered,d9tsvj5,1,t5_3edd2

If a gun is behind a slot machine and paying can help you get it then regardless of whether it gives an advantage or not its still cancerous. It sucks to get killed by something that you cant have simply because either you didnt pay for a better chance or you just arent as lucky as the guy who got it. In my opinion even if you will be able to get noncosmetic stuff with parts it would still ruin the game because people who pay still have an advantage  even more so because paying for supply drops means faster parts. as of right now the only way to get parts is through supply drops,Cod4Remastered,db8cjhs,2,t5_3edd2

10431473,0,t3_5pduqs,Mp silenced. Claymore uav jammer dead silence. Although i do have a stopping power class for the early rounds when UAVs are less likely. You could do a juggernaut class though if you prefer. The mp silenced is still really good without stopping power. The claymores are a big part of my game in search and Ive found them very useful on both defending and attacking. The more you use them the better youll get at knowing where to put them. Dead silence isnt really essential in my opinion but in search it seems like the best option. Other options would be extreme conditioning or deep impact. Also I highly recommend either smokes or flashes I prefer flashes. Stuns are shit compared to flashes though and I wouldnt recommend them. Also silenced pistols are garbage dont waste your time the silencer it is never worth it. ,Cod4Remastered,dcqh6ay,1,t5_3edd2
