170040,0,t1_cexqup6,Maybe its indoctrination but it made a sort of sense although ultimately I didnt agree with the instructor. My friend and fellow early cord has yet to get the sort of feel for capoeira that you normally see in youtube videos. Hes a very nice guy and his play style is not mean but he opts almost exclusively for straight kicks and during slow games hell just follow you with his foot and give you a dirt stamp on your shirt. If he doesnt esquiva in time hell reach out and block your foot like karate and he has a fondness for this cocarinha under mea lua de compasso and pull out the standing leg move that we learned during a batizado. The instructor tried to verbalize the lesson he was teaching but wasnt very clear it was something like if youre aggressive Ill be aggressive. The purpose of this post is to try to parse out generally what people find to be aggressive because we learn moves all the time that our mestre encourages us to use but in roda most of the advanced students do to the same moves every time when playing each other and when playing younger cords they do takedowns and the like or answer your round kick with a straight kick so there is a sort of hypocrisy. Im not singling this school out I love it here and by and large the people are so nice and encouraging but Ive seen this attitude elsewhere. The decent younger cords are like practice dummies where the people who just train for fun like a guy in his s that trains with us are left alone. This would be fine if people didnt immediately retaliate when the practice dummies show some initiative. Maybe the gestalt of capoeira asks you to take each game as a novel experience where if someone advanced initiates an aggressive game then you can respond in kind. But if you remember an advanced player being aggressive with you and you think Oh I learned that I can use certain techniques in every roda because someone advanced used them on me and you try to use those same moves in a different game you are rudely awakened.,capoeira,cexstw4,1,t5_2qvtg

701242,0,t1_cgjz1c7,I think for beginners the most common way of finding a class is googling capoeira with the location eg name of the city then picking the one with most convenient location and timetable. That is how I did anyway. Because as a beginner you dont know much about styles groups etc.Along the same line demos even posters and flyers contributes to capoeira for your area not necessarily for your group. As it increases the awareness. So better be on first page of google for attracting new students ,capoeira,cgjzfc8,2,t5_2qvtg
903618,0,t1_ch6s0ty,I shared it on facebook within our group. About the Mestre. Its just the way you describe the Mestres behaviour in the roda. How he stops the music etc. I was just asking where that came from. I know that beginners often hesitate getting to know their Mestres and see them as a separate part within the group. If that was the case I only stopped by to say that you dont need to worry about them as they are normal people as everbody else ,capoeira,ch6zvyg,1,t5_2qvtg

1501570,0,t3_2bb7oe,I would suggest to post a video so we can see what is the main problem during your kick. Youve got here some good advices but seeing the technique is better to find the flaw. Also I think your teacherprofessor might help you more than guys on internet because he sees you directly and can correct you right away.And at the end my advice would be just practice  if you can kick it slowly the speed will come with time you just need to practice ,capoeira,cj4hul5,2,t5_2qvtg

1999144,0,t1_cku2jqn,That vid is a great resource thank you! Im going to see if others in my group want to practice this specifically. Damn that was skillful and what a great skill set to have in the roda. Even when the rasiteria was given during the armada he had the presence of mind to turn his body catch himself and quickly go into a role. Thats some good inspiration. ,capoeira,cku3hkg,2,t5_2qvtg
2012638,0,t1_ckvdefp,Yeah definitely very difficult to execution. Some amazing athletes that are learning this stuff in their backyard! It seems to me a capoeria background especially with well developed floreios and acrobatics would provide a good base for tricking. This is just a matter of personal preference but in the capoeira context I feel like there is limited room for tricking. Doing tons of aerial floreios doesnt develop the dialogue or jogo very much to me. I do really like CDOs style though I definitely have a preference for some CDO players who dont overly use isolated floreiros but rather do a better jogo of incorporating them into their opponents movements. Though I suppose when people are doing solos or doing a demo as part of their Roda then nothing wrong with throwing in a few beastly moves. Just my thoughts! ,capoeira,ckvpx7b,2,t5_2qvtg

5050516,0,t3_3k44tf,The thing about capoeira is that lyrics can be borrowed from other songs and everyone will be happy with it as long as it sounds good.

5148686,0,t1_cv56cq2,Thank you very much for the great advice! But that brings about another question is there an easy way to make sure I am looking straight ahead? Most of the time I end up catching myself looking at my hand and feet placement and try to fix that and look where my opponent would be but then I have a hard time putting my hands and feet in the right place.I assume this comes along with practice but should I be focusing more on facing the right direction with my eyes and head or should I be focusing more on the placement of my hands and feet?,capoeira,cv6lzef,1,t5_2qvtg

10320842,0,t3_5nqxrw,What city are you moving to? what do you consider pretty bad shape is that weight? is that endurance? is it strength?Capoeira is fun but if you jump in and dont know your limit you might try and push well past it and end up injuring yourself.Personally Id recommend a Yoga class something to teach you body awareness. I see a lot of beginners looking at their feet while doing the moves because they arent really sure theyre in the right spot. The more youre aware of where your body is where your center of gravity is when youre moving the more stable youll be when doing many of Capoeiras moves.,capoeira,dcdxa3v,4,t5_2qvtg
10496707,0,t3_5qa685,Imo the whole point of going to visit other groups is to get exposed to a different style of capoeira.
