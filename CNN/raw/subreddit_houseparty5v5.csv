3384464,0,t3_2yxz3y,I think its going to be very interesting to see how the teams adapt to the new patch. Rom is already very comfortable playing zac who could be quite strong this patch. On the other hand Jeret has been playing a lot of sej who I think is the strongest jungler on this patch. I think if Rich gang allows Jeret if he is jungling to gank bot repeatedly with out punishing them somewhere else on the map they will definitly lose. Also I think if whoabad gets either xerath or ziggs than Rich Gang has no chance. How ever if Rich Gang can get Jett and Rom snowballing I think they will be able to take over the game. Overall prediction  Viktorious gaming but I think it really depends on how much this new patch changes things up and how picks and bans go.,houseparty5v5,cpe1zyc,1,t5_35mua

If people want to captain a team next season they have to put in the effort and win games. Currently everyone in the top eight goes tryhard mode with inhouses and to me that makes them more qualified to captain. Does it make them a perfect captain? No but it does accomplish its job of weeding out people who dont care.,houseparty5v5,cqk6m26,2,t5_35mua

6283400,0,t1_cz3enhf,Ill address it because Im the Official in question and although I agreed with your original message of this topic things youre saying are just false. gt the official needs to make sure that if a person is new he isnt left to the wolves and that someone help him First off the new Captain player had already played inhouses before. Seeing that he had only  under his belt WE decided to explain it to him.  He himself said in lobby that he understood how captains worked and briefly talked about first picklast pick. gtto avoid what happened impart to him what he needed to know so that he could see when its best to gtpick first or second pick. And we were told that its drafting time be quiet.Secondly uBakataumana and I both explained the advantages of firstsecond captain and the importance of picking a high ranked player first. uBakataumana then continued on with a more detailed speech reiterating things that had already been said so I interrupted him saying lets move on with the draft. There are  main reasons I said that.   The player previously said he understood how captains worked.    We had ALREADY explained how captains work and the advantages.  The only thing left to cover is specific players and his own teammates can advice him on that during the long draft phase anyway.gtbut was allowed to continue and lock in his pick before sufficient context was given from any of the gtplayers or the official.So to reconfirm this he was explained to twice and responded that he understood how it worked.Shortly after  you and uBakataumana lost your game in your words he drafted badly. That of course made you upset with what I did so you blamed me saying that I didnt let you fully reiterate the difference between stnd pick. Although the problem of the draft was not that he picked stnd captain but that he didnt pick the best players in each rotation. I dont think games are so easily lost from who gets stnd pick otherwise the nd captain would always win. Also the biggest point Id like to make is that AFTER the game he was chatting in the main lobby while you were expressing your frustration with me. He actually admitted that was the problem saying that he knew how captains worked and the advantages he just didnt know which specific players to pick.I completely agree with the message that in this current ranked format its brutal to new captains. Thats why I took it upon myself to explain to him how it worked and ALSO uBakataumana gave him a brief description. But at the same time as a new Official I dont want any misunderstandings to occur between us which exactly as uBakataumana says that I apologized for what I did and admitted it was rude while explaining my reasoning. I figured that after we had our small talk that was the end of it. I was even glad that this thread popped up to address the problems of new captains. But after seeing this anonymous slander Id really like to get all the facts straight.,houseparty5v5,cz3uoat,1,t5_35mua

Their ADC is a personal friend of Apozen as well as an acquaintance of mine. He came on to the team wanting to join. However circumstances in real life have led him to leave the team. This wasnt them just using someone to get into the league. This was a team that formed and practiced to get in. However now that theyve lost their ADC to a Girlfriend. They have become a more middle of the pack team instead of a front runner that they couldve been with their original roster.,houseparty5v5,d07wk14,1,t5_35mua

6872847,0,t1_d0uhm1r,Hi! I was the sub ADC for TDE those three games proof  I usually dont post on Reddit but browse this subreddit often. Thanks for giving me so much praise! ltThat  minute game was intense. I just used Sivir in the first game since her W can crit now and in S her W AD Ratio got buffed by  at all levels so if you get her out of the laning phase and into team fights shes super strong. A spellshield on  seconds with Max CDR is insane also. I think the biggest thing was frontline vs frontline. I could just deal more DPS to Braum Maokai and Lee than Lucian could do to Alistar Nautilus and Vi. My damage was inflated too because of the Ricochet crits bouncing throughout the whole team. I dont think Ill be playing tomorrow because TDEs ADC will be there for the games.I was so sad the second game. I think we drafted bad and tried to group constantly when your team was all wombo and could oneshot  people even with peel. Zentake tried to split on Kayle but I think it would have been better if he were there to ult whoever was being  man ulted. No one could get to Tristana and she was free to W into the team and do damage.The third game I feel like our team picked a winning top and bot lane and Zentake on TF knew how to play the Ahri matchup really well. In the mid game our picks with TF Gold Card and Morganas Dark Bindings were extremely strong and made fights a v and Tahm was forced to Devour someone away and I think the cooldowns of TF W and Morg Q are less than Tahms W so we could force another pick before Tahm could save them.Those are just my thoughts since one of the members of TDE linked me this post. I should really start playing ranked though but Im just waiting for solo queue to come out.,houseparty5v5,d0vcl88,1,t5_35mua

And not being allowed in Academy is not a punishment it is what is right. He is already in Ascension why does he need to be in Academy as well? Just to beat people he is already clearly better than?
