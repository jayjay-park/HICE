7709081,0,t3_4ktwnx,You should tell us what kind of job you envision for yourself.Lots of folks do bio undergrad then PhDs in tissue engineering and still dont get jobs in the field. They end up as consultants science writers etc. You wont be able to do a biology focused masters without doing a biology undergrad. Even with existing degrees youre looking at  years of full time study before youre competitive for graduate work which is generally required for high level work in tissue engineering. So I dont know what to tell you except that it might be  before youre getting a real job in tissue engineering. ,TissueEngineering,d3igysk,1,t5_2shbg
