1731584,0,t1_cjxdxl5,For me at least I found it really easy to read in Mark Hamills voice. He I think for most people is the go to joker voice. He was the joker we were raised with. Given your awesome monologue you presented Id be interested to see what you think of my monologue I wrote for him that I posted here!  ,joker,cjxfinm,1,t5_2tolo

3790196,0,t3_33rv1v,Im hoping this isnt final but I like this direction. The teeth make since cuz I mean the dude  fights batman. I think it would  be better if his tats looked less professional but they could make it make sense in the movie. Maybe he was a tattoo artist before his acident?  The only one that really bothers me is the forehead. Seems too emo for my tastes.  But again if the can give a good explanation it could work. Maybe it was forced on him? ,joker,cqob95z,1,t5_2tolo
3910043,0,t1_cr1ct27,I agree that TDK like Batman before it showed just the tip of the iceberg of what The Joker is and what he really stands for. Unfortunately no  minute caricature can truly describe the character of The Joker. While there are not many layers there like a diamond are a lot of facets. ,joker,cr1zadh,2,t5_2tolo

8519832,0,t3_4we0gq,For me the jurys still out on Jared Letos Joker Im not sure if he wasnt good enough or if he just wasnt in enough scenes to flesh out the character also given that DCWarner Bros have cut an awful lot of stuff from the film its more likely the latter. That being said for me his Joker seemed a little gimmicky the stories of him being so in into his character that he sent presents to his costars seems to say to me that he spent more time on the gimmicks and the cool stories that would sell the movie rather than stuff that would actually make the character interesting also fresh interpretations of characters are fine but The Jokers interpretation in this film seems to be taking a street thug and making him a bit psychotic. Maybe he wasnt that good or maybe he just wasnt used enough either way the jury is still out for me. ,joker,d66jfu8,3,t5_2tolo

11412946,0,t1_dfpjn9i,I dont think this post is being brigaded by users of td I believe a large portion of Reddit is just tired of the Trump bashing infecting every odd subreddit.Besides doesnt a brigade need a call to action in the form of a post or something? Otherwise its Reddits userbase commenting and voting on a post that hit the front page. A large portion of Reddit disagreeing with someone doesnt mean brigade.,joker,dfpna00,4,t5_2tolo
