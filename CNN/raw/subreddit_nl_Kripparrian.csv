D Just be nice and unban people.  itll piss off the rest of them  especially kauzmanGACopt DDdeal?In all seriousness though rooms like Trump and kripparrian where over  people and k during peak timespopular games are present are more like a STADIUM rather than a small gathering. In a stadiumlike frenzy everyone behaves as a group and everyone understand and feels whats going on. On top of that streamers and chatters eventually learn to read the fast moving chat  my eyes used to hurt but now its easy to spot anything in kripparrians chat. Just have certain Bot functions that can delete ascii when its overly used and thats it. For a room as big as trumps  it makes sense to treat is as a stadium and have No rules about what people say  especially as silly as mind if I roll need dongers lol.At the end I love trump  ive watched him since he made sc strategy videos on youtube. I never cared about twitch chatrooms until I realized in kripp chat they can be a very fun collective experience with the rest of s of people thinking the same thing as you are and enjoying the same thing you are.

869428,0,t3_242t51,I think this is a case of both sides being a bit wrong but also a bit right.Does rhearthstone need to stop praising Reynad like hes some kind of god? Yes. They need to accept that he can come across as a bit whiny and angry at the game sometimes and they need to stop rewarding him for acting that way. That doesnt mean he isnt good at the game  he like the rest of us has his moments. Prime example was the wombocombo play we saw in the tournament.And I know I might get flak for this particularly since this is a subreddit dedicated to him but Kripp also needs to realize when he is being funny and when he isnt. No not everyone is a fan of Kripp a lot of people just find it childish and annoying when he brings up comments like he did in the tournament instead of focusing on the play at hand. I like him and I tune in to his streams a lot but certain situations do call for more maturity than a personal livestreamDoes this mean that Kripp is the bad guy? Of course not. Does this mean Reynad is the bad guy? Nope. Neither of them are. rHearthstone is right half of the way there and rnlKripparrian is right half of the way there. People need to put their fanboyism behind them on both sides and ask If Ekp said this would I find it funny? If Trump made that comment would I just brush it off?.TLDR Fanboyism is bad.

No.  Particularly fat soluble vitamins are where the human body is extremely inefficient and absolutely needs animal products.  Ex Omega s are good for us but our bodies cant actually process Omega s into the biologically useful compound EPA at anything more than  efficiency.  Even DHA is inefficiently used compared to pure EPA that is found in most seafood and grass fed ruminants.,nl_Kripparrian,ch7h1e9,0,t5_2yl0q

Vegetarians dont stick to vegetables only they eat eggs dairy products etc. Just anything that doesnt involve killing animals. Vegans stay strictly away from anything animal. All this makes the vegetarian lifestyle richer in nutrition and vitamins. You could live healthy as a vegan but most vegans dont. Its expensive and tedious to find the right products. Thus most vegans have shorter lifespans than vegetarians and even normal meat eaters. ,nl_Kripparrian,cmqnpsw,0,t5_2yl0q

4867316,0,t3_3hk427,At least read the goddamn shit you copypaste.The Gamblers Fallacy is not about luck its a misconception of statistics and random entirely separate rolls.This is more accurate for games like Roulette were people tend to overanalyze small samples. Lets say the roulette spins  reds in a row what are the odds of another red in the th spin?Mathematically correct  Gamblers Fallacy  . they accumulate and calculate the odds of  reds in a row which is totally wrong as there is no memory on truly randomized spinsOn most games what people suffer is what is called Negativity Bias. Which means things that are negative tend to be either exagerated or recalled as much worse than it actually was and ends up weighting more than positive memories hence why he considers his luck Normal when he gets extremely lucky and considers his opponents as extremely lucky.This applies to other games too like MOBAS were people tend to remember  bad match strongly and normal or good matches barely. RIOT Games have a Psychologist or doctor in we working for them entirely on the player experience kinda thing and I remember him saying that in order to erase or not heavily consider a very negative match the player must get like  or  positive matches afterwards. Basically saying that if you get anything below  bad luck  good luck then you will feel that your experience was negative and that youve shitty luck even on  scenarios.,nl_Kripparrian,cu8293y,8,t5_2yl0q

So indeed what kripp is doing is stupid because he has no reason to be vegan other than for fun. On top of that kripp has confirmed he missed meat for example burgers with meat.
