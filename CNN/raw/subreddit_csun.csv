640594,0,t1_cgc69ja,Oh wow. Thanks for warning me about that. I highly doubt she would have me removed but I dont want to risk that... Ill try emailing the department office. Thank you so much for the advice!!Edit On a second thought Ill wait for her class to end and then Ill go in to talk to her. Therefore I wont be trespassing. If she still refuses to give me my flash drive after talking to her in person only then will I escalate it to emailing the department and or dean. ,csun,cgd342y,1,t5_2r6u1

1813994,0,t3_2fb2wj,I can only speak to Elite since I worked at its branch in Northridge. Id say avoid that one since the curriculum is half super stodgy and half fun class games that are actually lame and pointless. And half of the classrooms are like windowless cells. Although I imagine this might be the case for most prep places.,csun,ck7rmer,2,t5_2r6u1

11225603,0,t1_df43frj,I absolutely agree with this. College is what you make it. I take my time at CSUN very seriously and so does my circle of CSUN compsci friends. Most of my circle has had multiple internships or extended internships during their time at CSUN and most of us have job offers lined up for after graduation. I transferred from a CC and this is my second year at CSUN. I absolutely love it and have no regrets about my decision. I have been in your shoes and I am totally down if you want to DM me and talk. Please feel free to do so. ,csun,df4ep2v,6,t5_2r6u1
