I dont find the diet itself very expensive but I dont eat organic or grassfedpastured maybe thats why but all the supplements Im taking are so damn pricey even though theyre definitely helping me.,AutoImmuneProtocol,ctzsvtk,1,t5_2z7kq

Its not super quick but its pretty hands off after you get it in the pan so you can do other things while it cooks. Its really good too. ,AutoImmuneProtocol,dbns161,2,t5_2z7kq
