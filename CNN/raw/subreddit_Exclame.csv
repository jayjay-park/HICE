4481324,0,t3_3bp0tc,Twitch user name TaromiPvPMikuia LvL Reasons              Id like to be a Moderator on your Stream because I enjoy             watching it I like your character and I want to help you             somehow. I also want to help other people who need             help with some commands so you have enough time             to answer other questions. I also got some experience             at the rank of a Moderator at some few big Minecraft             Servers even Its not the same It could be interesting             to know.Mod Powah              Like I already said I want to help other people at some             Stream questions so you can answer other questions             which may be more interesting for the Viewers. I also             would watch out for spammers or flamers to show them             a stop.Who Iam             Iam Marlon  years and Im from Germany. Iam a              friendly and competetive person who likes to help             other people and try to make them happy. I can speak             English almost as well as German but I can speak              some other languages too like Spanish and Japanese to             help some Viewers who may dont speak English that goodAt the end I want to say that I would try to come as much as I can. I would be happy if I get a respond.Grettings Marlon.             ,Exclame,csvjdef,1,t5_33otq
