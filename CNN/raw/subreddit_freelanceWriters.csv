This doesnt have to mean keyword stuffing but a lot of times it does. The client might ask you to put the keyword in the article so many times that the piece ends up sounding unnatural. Type B clients want you to write for human readers. That means using the keyword as well as synonyms and longtail keywords. This results in a much higherquality piece. Type A is trying to game Google. Type B is trying to please Google. Increasingly Type A clients are realizing that Google has moved away from the keyword as its primary focus.

For example if youre a journalist or a PR writer youll generally follow the AP style guidelines when freelancing. Some publications and companies will have their own internal guidelines that would cover how you have to cite things. And if youre writing your own blog its entirely up to you to determine your style guidelines if any. In the end the most important thing is that you credit the source in some way if you make a specific reference for example you cant claim that youre the original source of the data.

Google can answer every question youve posed. Im pointing this out because in my experience  of writing is research.  is editing.  is actual writing. As for confidence I think it takes experience and a certain kind of personality. Youre going to face rejection in this field because its part of the game. A long time ago my mentor told me to go after rejection. He said go fail a lot because youll get a tough skin and youll get the experience you need. This was good advice so Im passing it along.   lta great resource for starting freelancers  lt another great resource and the lady who runs this blog posts on this forum a lot too.And as far as a website...it doesnt have to be a blog but a blog is definitely good to have.

Firstly I would be paid  for an H.I. piece whether it took me two hours or two months to write. Secondly writers artists and actors are not paid by the hour precisely because they are not wheelbarrowpushers and sod layers. I say that not to denigrate manual labor I am proud to come from a farming background but to attempt to illustrate to you some basic economic principles of which youre clearly ignorant Professions that are risky are better paid. Any creative work is risky work because it may or may not be wellliked by the rather mercurial public and thus may or may not result in profits and further demand. Talent comes as a price.

The article isnt posted yet but here is a link to a few articles that might help which have been published on the same site. If you wanna cruise the site there are also some other options for making money online that might help pad inbetween the paychecks but writing is still your best bet.There are content mills places such as Text Broker and Constant Content but Ill tell ya not to spend too much time there. I also recommend checking out  which is a writingcentric job board. Various publications also accept writers such as the Escapist if you have nerdy interests or Cracked if you can write good clickbait. Check out ListVerse. Check out LoveToKnow check out Break Studios. Somewhere inbetween all those places youre sure to find some kind of money.

7454954,0,t1_d2pcqbh,Sure! The first step is to find an RSS feed that works for you. Personally I prefer Feedreader which can be found here feedreader.comThe second step is to go to the Craigslist US page here Thirdly you need to open each individual page and then go to whatever sections you want to get posts from  Writing Gigs Writing Jobs etc. and then you take the link from the top of the pages and copy it. Fourthly in Feedreader there is a button that says Add a New Feed  click that and then paste the address in the line that says Address. Save it. If you use another RSS feed then this step may look a little different but will basically be the same.Once youve done all those then the RSS feed will automatically update with any new posts from the pages youve put in it. You can scroll through the titles which will all be links to the pages and then open any that you find relevant to yourself. Its a lot of work initially I think it took me a few days to set up because I couldnt stomach copying all those links at once but once its done then its very easy to use  FAR better than going through Craigslist manually.,freelanceWriters,d2pkxbz,1,t5_2s9hc

This means you can slowly transition and dont need to try to make the jump all at once. If it were meand it is me actually because I just quit my job to go fulltime freelanceI would take the first option. BUT I wouldnt start working with content mills. Fuck that. Its a waste of time. Spend the hours you would have put into writing  articles and use it to scour the web for real writing opportunities with real companies. You have a portfolio of writing work it sounds. If you dont then just write some stuff for fun. Make up projects. Put words on a page and show them to people. Basically Dont waste time with the bullshit. If you are a good writer spend your time looking for good clients and then get them to pay you.

If youre looking for concrete steps to get started I dunno post on rslavelabour to get your feet wet. Or hit up local businesses and charities and offer to contribute your services for free. This is traditionally how you start building a portfolio. Get a handful of nice clips ask for referrals stuff like that. Actually getting out there and gaining experience will help you better identify which niche you enjoy working in and it might be something that had never occurred to you. For example one of the main sources of work for me has been the plastic card industry.In saying the above I know youre not after a career  but if you work hard and get a little bit lucky writingeditings the sort of thing you can continue to do on the side for years.If you want to get paid nowish then yeah. Content mills might be the way to go. Give Upwork and Freelancer a miss try Textbroker or one of the other places listed in the sidebar. I think Ezdia have shifted to a constant intake of writers so you could give them a look too. If youre a decent typist you could try transcription. You miiiight have to be  for tax purposes or whatever so they could be locked out for you this summer.PS. Youre probably a lot better at writing about games than youd think. Try reviews  they dont require encyclopedic knowledge of games in general just the ability to play and evaluate a game. Most enthusiast press sites should take on writers for revenueshare read probably no pay unless your piece gets a shitload of views and supply them with game keys.Also if I had my time again and was  and had the nearlimitless energy that comes with that Id approach selfpublished romance novelists and copy edit for them.

9903555,0,t3_5h31co,some questions  did this client find you or did you find them?  are you listing your degree as an asset e.g. posing yourself as an expert how big is the companywhats their budget like? do you have any idea?  have you written for them before and if so what has your rate been? how much extra research will this take roughly? this is super specialized and the research sounds like it would be extensive. there are two things to think about when coming up with a rate first whats reasonable in terms of the companybudgetetc. whats a rate that you think they will accept or at least negotiate down from?second is that rate that you just came up with worth the extra work and research youll have to put into each article? higher rates can be good but if the amount of extra work isnt reasonable than its better to take a lowerpaying easier job. a word article that takes you one hour to researchwrite and pays .word is a much better business decision than a word article that takes you six hours to researchwrite and pays word. as for my personal experience for something specialized like this i would start as high as possible  especially if youre not going to be particularly upset if they dont like your rates. seriously something like post assuming each post takes less than five or six hours to write would be my lowend.,freelanceWriters,daygfwi,1,t5_2s9hc

The better you learn the better youre serving the clients and the quicker they will value your services enough to pay. Its like starting a mighty ball rolling. V tough at first but then youll gather momentum.,freelanceWriters,dby1ite,1,t5_2s9hc
10321562,0,t3_5ns50w,If they are your images and they are publishing them then they should pay you for them. If they are someone elses pictures then they should be paying that artistphotographer. As for the work of finding them unfortunately if you agreed to do it without pay then you do it with out pay. Im not sure if there is a standard for that sort of thing just for the ownership and permissions to publish them. Next time if they arent willing to pay for that say your a writer not an editor so youll need extra for providing that service. And if they say no then youll need to weigh the pros and cons again. ,freelanceWriters,dce07yk,1,t5_2s9hc

10926427,0,t3_5w291k,Sheesh first I would advise them against  pages. Second charge an appropriate price for your time they have money. Take into account not only the time you may spend writing but also rewriting and dont forget to take into account that you get taxed higher as an independent contractor and dont get benefits. I would charge a per word rate and then I would suss out if they just want some content or if they want quality content to their specifications. Ask a few followups and get as many details as you can on what they want on each page what tone they want and what word count they want. You could also figure out your per word rate figure out how many words they want on each page and then charge them a flat fee. Hope that helps. The client may back out but you dont want to get stuck in a situation where youre working really hard for pennies or you work really hard and they reject your work. Might want to submit a single page at a time and get their written OK that they like it too so you dont get to the end and have them decide theyre not going to pay because they didnt like it. ,freelanceWriters,de6zga4,1,t5_2s9hc
