34373,0,t3_1uhmk9,In college in Chicago a group of us would play Tales games together Symphonia Abyss Vepseria started Eternia. After college several of us moved out of town for work. Currently my husband and I are down in Houston and a friend that played with us previously is living in Austin. For Graces and Xillia our friend in Austin would drive the  hours and spend a weekend with us. As you can tell you love playing these games together! Our next adventure will probably be Xillia  woooI would love to be able to play online with people just so we didnt have to wait for open weekends and the long drive to play. ,tales,ceicf7l,2,t5_2t9fb

196618,0,t1_ceurs06,I tried playing Symphonia years ago and being a turn based fanatic I couldnt grasp the battle system and continually got smashed in battles rage quite the game and thought I hated Tales. Fast forward to Tales of Graces f release and I decided to pick it up since JRPGs sucked on PS at the time and ended up thinking is was ok not great but I learned how to battle and finished the whole game finally. Then played Vesperia loved it. Now playing Xillia and plan to play Abyss DS before Xillia s release and the Tales series is my nd favorite series after SMT now. Just practice the battle system for a while to get a hang out of it.

607462,0,t3_211b4j,I enjoyed Dawn of the New World for the time it lasted but I doubt Id ever go back being honest. Most people cite the cast as the main problem and I absolutely understand this  I actually didnt mind Emil but for me the original cast appearances felt forced and shoehorned in and they took a lot of characters quite far out of character in it. Tenebrae is pretty cool though. In my opinion the main problem is that it just feels cheap. Original Symphonia was such an ambitious huge game and Dawn of the New World just... isnt. From the lack of a World Map or equivalent to the short length to the limited number of permanent playable characters it just doesnt stand up. And the worst offence is when they literally copy and paste dungeons straight from Symphonia  theres an homage or whatever but when the Temple of Lightning has the exact same puzzle with the exact same solution its a bit ridiculous.The one redeeming thing is the battle system IMO. I dont like monster hunting but the battles themselves are really fast and fun to play. Its kind of a faster dumber Tales of the Abyss battle system but it really works. Still I doubt Ill ever go back even with the PS Remaster. ,tales,cg9bksd,9,t5_2t9fb

913556,0,t3_24kvis,So Asbels BArte style has no basic attack. AArte style does which is as youve discovered the reason for Asbels lunging attack.Iron Stance is a different thing than what you said it occurs right after drawing Asbels sword which gives him a couple of hits where he is unstaggerable.Asbel cannot combo fluidly between his two arte styles as well as say Hubert  Asbel in fact has only a few options to do so. The BArtes Sparrow Seal and Aurora Lotus will automatically sheathe the sword at the end of the arte so you can use AArtes at the end of them.Certain BArtes also can be altered into AArtes by holding down the BArte button but you must have leveled certain arte titles for this functionality.

2754768,0,t3_2rloi0,It really depends on how much you weigh story vs. combat. Newer tales games generally have vastly superior combat systems Xillia  and  are my favourite in terms of combat. Symphonia has probably one of the best stories of the series but its combat system is somewhat dated No freerun much less developed skills and artes system.On PS Vesperia is probably the best overall but is only Japanese so if you can read Japanese get it. After that Id recommend Xillia  gt Symphonia gt Xillia  gt Graces. ,tales,cnh7ejo,2,t5_2t9fb

3128007,0,t1_colzzvh,Id say the combat is closer to Vesperia with the limited attacks of Xillia which does not matter much if you counter since there is a skill that restores your tc. All artes can be chained together like Xillia although some spells are borderline useless without chaselink which instant casts spells. It has a very fun aerial combat system with chaselink but it also has a decent amount of aerial artes which allow you to combo in the air a lot harder to do though. I never had problems with artes missing too much except spells unless i was using freerun and my axis was messed up.Overall the combat is great because it has very little problems countering can be hard to learn at the beginning and gives a lot of your tools very quickly.,tales,com7sar,2,t5_2t9fb

4827480,0,t3_3gxdzl,You make it sound like the Tales series only started coming out in the West in . IMO one of the big reasons Tales isnt more popular in the West is because Namco wasnt willing to take a risk early on. They released Destiny for PS in  with no dub. Then skipped over Phantasia PS. Then brought Eternia here in  with a subpar dub. Then skipped over Destiny II. Then brought Symphonia to Game Cube. Then skipped Rebirth... And instead of jumping on the momentum Symphonia had they released Legendia which seems to have turned some people off of Abyss which came out later. Not to mention they released Abyss just two weeks before FFXII came out in the US. Namco wasnt willing to seriously invest in the series in the West like say Squaresoft was in the s until very recently. So it makes sense that the series is considered niche. They kept playing it safe until very recently. Why do you think Final Fantasy is so big? Squaresoft was localizing the games when few other Japanese companies saw it as being worthwhile and it paid off for them when FFVII became a huge hit.Bamco just waited too long and played it safe for way too long. Not the fans fault at all.gt Tales of Zestiria... Well many people were upset about a certain person not being in the party... That could be another reason...Im really tired of this narrative being trotted out over and over again. Thats not the only reason Japanese fans were dissatisfied with Zestiria. People point to a bunch of  star reviews on Amazon Japan as a sign of angry fanboyism but thats not really significant. What is significant is the fact that Japanese fans sold back the game to the point that its price on Amazon Japan dropped to more than  yen. That cant just be angry Alisha fanboys. Even on US Amazon Zestirias import for PS is cheaper than the localized release which I have never seen happen for a Tales game before.You also have to consider the wider context in Japan. Japanese fans have been getting every Tales game so thats not even a concern for them. However for the past  years theyve also been subjected to a pattern of releasing a game in the series then a year later releasing an updated version and being expected to get that as well. This happened with Vesperia Graces Wii which was terribly buggy in its first release sort of with Xillia Xillia  making up for Xillia being rushed and now even with Zestiria as evidenced by the PS version that Japan isnt even getting. I imagine they were fed up with getting rushed games by the time Zestiria came out after being hyped up as the th anniversary title. I wish people would at least try to look at things from Japanese fans perspective instead of automatically jumping to just one explanation that hardly explains the whole situation.And in a recent investor meeting fans even brought up their fears about the Tales series future under Babas direction. Zestirias issues in Japan go far beyond just one character being marketed misleadingly.,tales,cu31l0u,1,t5_2t9fb

Sounds silly but the fact you cant control the camera while exploring the world just basically made it feel like I was playing a sidescroller I get really annoyed by this in games for some reason it just feels lazy when they do this. The graphics ugh the whole everyone looks like a  year old just killed it straight away. I didnt get too far into to the story to pass a fair opinion though Sophie was a pretty awesome character. The fighting system from what I can remember was possibly the thing that ultimately killed it for me though I can just about deal with everything else but I remember that fighting system just made no sense to me and I rage quit and never returned.Xillia The general interface amp presentation was better in my opinion I felt like I was playing a semiserious story and it pulled me in... I was invested in the characters and actually wanted to keep going. Story isnt really a fair point to compare since I never finished graces. also just the general gameplay the world exploration and quests the fact I could control the camera silly little things like this. Also like I said it reminded me a little of StarOcean The Last Hope it was somehow mature but still full of animeesque JRPG tropes.

6165016,0,t1_cyq5n3c,Haha yes this was inspired by that! Good guess. However it was also inspired by the person we were responding to. Antistis mentioned the idea of they changed it now it sucks and the critics who complain about that and how theyre annoying as heck. I agree that just hating Zestiria because its different is bad... but I think its okay even if Im part of the annoying minority to complain about the exact nature of those changes. For example the staff was changed pretty heavily the directors and writers who I liked best werent given the lead roles on the project. If whining encourages Bamco to give back the reins to the old writers that wouldnt be bad! If the change that sucks is firingstaff reduction or cruel budget cuts then maybe its okay to dislike a game purely for that change. I suppose what a lot of critics mistake though is that getting some Redditor to accept an opinion is a far cry from getting the Tales team to accept it. Even if everyone on the US Reddit unanimously accepted the same position on Tales it might not really mean anything... You mentioned that some people shove their opinions on others and try to ruin the game and thats not really cool. Like it might be more okay to try to push the opinion if you or others had any control over what the game does but if were all just on reddit chatting we should be friends as part of the same little community. The person you were responding to disliked all opinions of the differentsuck variety whereas you seemed to dislike pushy mean people. I mean I try not to be but Im likely one of those pushy people heheh. Sorry bout that.On X one issue seems to be that X was pushed hard as an anniversary game? So it got a sales boost from that in part. In fact there seems to have been a huge marketing push in Japan for X. Hrm.Heres some more information about the target of X and how badly it missedIt seems to have suffered from poor marketing. Its also possible lots of people bought Xillia during the hypefest and didnt like it so didnt buy the sequel. Something similar might happen in the Mass Effect franchise if the very vocal haters vote with their wallets on the next entry.I cant actually find the sales forecast for Zestiria. Even with the low sales they might have outperformed expectations. Thats the whole ticket I guess... If they put tons of money into the game and then it flops even if the game was super amazing it can be devastating. Okami is the classic historical example which took out the whole studio. On the other hand if chopping out content made the process super cheap if they saved bunches of money on Zestiria and then had low sales expectations they might have been more successful than expected. On the spoiler cover thing on the right hand side of the Tales reddit in the subreddit policy they give an example of spoiler syntax.

Companies often make budget decisions which are beyond the comprehension of mere mortals so I could live with that.gtYet there is one additional fact that tells us even this scenarioterrible as it is does not suffice to capture the full extent of incompetence or apathy at play here. If I also had to guess I would say the fact that the game comes free to those who preordered Zestiria also adds to that. Basically a lot of people didnt pay to get the game so they care even less about it and made an even smaller budget. Plus people cant really get a refund on the game since they didnt buy it.

7352186,0,t1_d2dvwhz,I called them false equivalencies because they are. Comparing the color of clothing regardless of how stupid it is doesnt compare to a woman fighting in tattered rags for literally no discernible reason that can be made. The design is bad because the design is bad I dont generally care about these things enough to be angry about them but I can completely see WHY people dont like the design and why is doesnt seem to make any sense when compared to a party that is fully dressed and doesnt appear to be designed more for fanservice purposes.The fact that youre immediately taking this as me insulting you when Im pointing out a fallacy in your argument your girlfriend liking a thing  other girls agreeing and the fact that you seem intent on railing Cherrim for her opinion just because you disagree with it. Im not going to apologize for stepping in and saying something when your attitude reeks of well because I like the thing people who have a different opinion are WRONGhaters and you shouldnt try to call out a thing based on the existence of other things. I find that insulting as all hell. The fact of the matter is we could sit and argue about how stupid Asbels costume is or Repedes pipe. But this thread is about Velvet. Its not about those other things so dragging them into it has literally nothing to do with the design principles in Berseria. Youre entitled to like Velvets design.

7452462,0,t3_4h843b,gtJust got Edna and I STILL feel like I havent got the hang of the battle system.You can specify your peeve about the battle system and maybe we can elaborate. tbh Zestiria had a lot of bad designs in the battle system. For starters there is a hidden limiter for the combo system other than SC. At the beginning of the game you can only link  actions including sidefrontback stepping and martialhiddenseraphic arte. This limiter can be increased with some titles and Skills Endless same even removes it completely so as long as you have SC you can execute attacks endlessly. If you add Lucifer same then its theoretically combo all day every day. Unfortunately this limiter system is invisible so sometimes when you sidesteps to dodge attacks youll kinda lose count on which stage of action are you currently in. This is really infuriating when it comes to Martial Arte for the most part. For example you wanted use the sttier Martial Arte to inflict weakness hit but you have to dodge the attack first. If you use the Martial Arte right away youll instead attack with the ndtier Martial Arte thus not inflicting the weakness hit. Of course you can just wait half a second or so after dodging to refresh the action. But its still a rather poor gameplay design choice. Especially when it runs on an invisible counter unlike Graces CC and Xillias AC which is visible. Also Zestiria has another interesting battle system mechanics that I think is poorly explained I myself only learned of this when battling the wraith enemy. Zestiria has a rockpaperscissors system with its MartialHiddenSeraphic Arte.  If you use Martial arte on an enemy that is using Hidden Arte the enemy will just shrug your attacks off a superarmorlike state and I think your damage will lessen considerably.  If you use Hidden Arte against an enemy that is casting Seraphic Arte e.g. the fucking wraiths youll just speed up their casting very quickly to almost instantaneous speed wrecking your shit up. But if you use Martial Arte on an enemy that is castingusing Seraphic Arte you can interrupt the casting immediately.So Hidden gt Martial gt Seraphic gt Hidden.Pretty nice addition to the system so that you can know when is best to Armatize and when its best to stay separated. When Armatized you only have access to Seraphic and Hidden Artes so if you come across a huge horde of casters e.g. fucking wraiths youre gonna be boned snrrk. Well this tidbit is only useful if youre playing on higher difficulties because in lower difficulties you can just Maelstrom or Calamity Flare to victory.Anyway you can elaborate more on what system youre unsure of and well try to explain.,tales,d2paqhq,2,t5_2t9fb
7475872,0,t1_d2rdrdm,gt How much more due diligence can she really do though?Considering taking a life is an action that is irreversible Id say no due diligence is enough. Thats why I dont buy the defense for Rose that she makes sure that the people she kills are bad people. That is insanely simplistic.Going back to my example from FateZero the show actually bothers to show the sympathetic side of some of the people Kiritsugu kills. They commit some terrible actions but they have believable reasons for doing what they do. So when Kiritsugu whos the hero of the story kills them it brings out a mixed reaction. On the one hand these people seem overall worse than Kiritsugu is. On the other hand they have lives and loved ones too. Its a nice level of complexity that makes the story and the world in which it takes place engaging.Thats mostly absent in Zestiria. When it comes to Rose since shes always right we dont really get the other half of the story. Were just told that these people deserve to die and thats the end of it. Thats giving way too much credit to Rose if you ask me.I mean the game can go ahead and present Rose as the unquestioned judge jury and executioner. Im just saying that that is terrible writing that wastes the potential of the characters and the setting.I call her a psychopath because I just find her personality so jarring and difficult to believe. And as a character Rose just doesnt seem coherent. Its like the genki girl side of her is a different person from the perfect assassin who can do no wrong.

Also I just noticed I am apparently getting downvoted again here just for asking a question lol I dont really understand people.

8709825,0,t3_4z96km,Its pretty fun.I thought that the party members are going to be serious and mature read edgelord but theyre quite laidback and have hilarious quirks. One of the recurring side events that really tickled me is the members sin confessions at churches. Magilou being Magilou trolled the priest Rokurou admonished the priest while the priest was confused by it Laphicet confessing very heavily for a kid reminded me of Negis confession in Mahou Sensei Negima and Eizen being siscon as usual. Havent seen Velvet and Eleanors yet but pretty sure the priest is gonna be hilarious again.So yeah the characters are very good mostly. I can see how everyone likened the cast with Vesperia because they do have that chemistry going on while also being mature and isnt afraid to take actions. Despite everyones fascination for her I dont really like Magilou much though. I dont like Pascal either so maybe its just not my cup of tea. And Ive always loved team of antagonists in Tales game. Four Stars Six God General Fauves  they make for quite a good anticipation for the unevitable clash.I think the story is very enjoyable especially because it confirmed and subverted a lot of the common knowledge of Zestirias era. The fact that we played as the direct opposite of Sorey made for one fascinating dualism.ampnbspNow gameplay. What I really like about it is that everyone has their specialty. Magilou is really indispensable in fight against casters. Eizen is good against big enemies while Rokurou and Eleanor for the smaller ones because of their artes mobility. Laphicet despite his Break Soul being more supportbased is the best spam caster in the game lol. Velvet is for making the game easy. I use her as my trump card for when everything else fails shell be there to bulldoze everything. Shes OP.The permanent free run takes some time getting used to not locking on enemy anymore but in multiplayer its a very good change imo. What I dont like at first is the arte tree system because you have to change it up often for boss battles and new areas so that youll hit the necessary weaknesses to trigger ChainPower Hit combo. Its just unnecessary hassle compared to manually triggerable arte via directional  face button.But suddenly I saw that there are shortcut button for artes  L  face button  hidden from the main arte tree page. I was like where were you this fucking whole time? Needless to say I rescinded my previous grievance with the battle system that time.One thing to note is Dangerous Encounter entering battle with more than one group of monster is literally very dangerous. They have higher stats and HP and most probably will invite a Wandering Enemy to barge into the battle I think the Wandering Enemy also has boosted stats goddammit. The monsters also have higher rate of stunning and inflicting ailments so youll lose a lot of Soul Gauge if youre trapped with a bunch of enemies making you useless and dying a lot of times.ampnbspThe game lacks the discovery and adventure aspect though. Theres only one collectible worth mentioning the Katz treasure chest. It doesnt help the dungeon is linear hallways like Xillia while the field is an empty vast land.Oh yeah. You think Zaphgott Moor in Zesty is bad? Lets see how you deal with this one green area.At least in Zestiria we have a bunch of collectibles  Normin Discovery Point Monoliths and probably a crucible. But there are none of these in Berseria making for a desolate and tiring field to navigate.ampnbspSakurabas battle bgm is meh at most I like his older synths better than the newer mostly plagued with orchestral stuff. I havent yet heard a really good track for battles but there is this one melancholic piano bgm that is great. And the field theme while not mindblowing is nice to hear while traversing the vast landscape.EDIT Okay the Abbey battle bgm is pretty neat. The fact that Eleanor has her Abbey costume with that BGM make it all the better.ampnbspAnyway Berseria is a really good game even by Tales standard imo. I liked methodical Zestirias battle system better but its still fun mowing down enemies and just playing as a being of absolute carnage like in those Musou games.I would recommend waiting for NA release because it isnt like before when Tales series is in a localization drought. I dont know if its gonna have dual audio like Zestiria but its something to look forward to for weeabs.,tales,d6ud4hj,17,t5_2t9fb

8926504,0,t1_d7kh4mu,Dont get me wrong I consider mobility and survivability the main selling points of Wind Armatus besides mystic arte damage. Artes feel very clunky and unresponsive. However I felt like there might be something going for it with at least  attacks in combo or infinite with the ability to combo left clicks into meleeranged seraphic artes.Lailah has very good area attacks and high damage making her best Armatus for farming. However her HP is not very good and she has very poor defences and healing  if you receive a status debuff youre pretty sure going out of Armatus.Mikleo is very safe and reliable can grind out almost any boss in scenario where Zaveidother human are running away and defending while Water Armatus chips away boss hp and heals itself by ridiculous . Artes have terribly long animations and startup and Mikleos damage overall seems meh making him bad for farming.Edna has good defences and overall the most balanced Armatus making her excel at nothing. Her melee range with no mobility spells doesnt help either. Never use except when I really need that Earthshaker on  medusa casting spells around me.Zaveid has the best HP among seraphs and his early game items can have very high base A.Atk and P.Atk. If you grind items early on Chaos Wind Armatus will have the best defences alongside with best ability to explode boss in  mystic artes. Area healingdamage is nice. That said his weakness coverage is trash so as all of his hidden artes besides triple forwardX. Didnt thoroughly test his combo options with seraphic artes though.Also you most likely want to stack over  wind damage on Rose for Dream Slasher abuse which adds to Zaveid Mystic Arte.,tales,d7ku1t3,1,t5_2t9fb

Thats hardly a surprise compared to preZestiria where you probably had no idea who the final boss was until half way in at least.spoiler Berseria Usually Tales games start out with you having a smaller goal and it ends up building up to the final boss rather than starting the game and saying hey this guy is your opponent! and then it turns out hes the final boss with no twists.spoiler Berseria Did you assume Van was Abysss final boss in the first  minutes? Duke? Gauis? I didnt they had to build up to it and I liked that.spoiler Multiple Tales final bosses That format missing from Zestiria is something I disliked about it and this seems to push it further in that direction.

Everything in the game is fast travel the story is the most characterdriven in the series and the plot makes sense. In terms of is this a good Tales game? Probably not. Its missing a lot of core components that Tales games have. Theres only  main characters with the other slots going to plotspecific party members or monsters that you tamed. Its not as long as most Tales games and the dungeons arent really unique. Quite a number of them are reused or inspired by dungeons from TOS.I love the characters though. I love that Johnny Yong Bosch and Laura Bailey voice canon love interests. I love that we get a ton of closure from TOS.

I wish he didnt have such a godawful colour scheme though since that gets passed on to almost every other Tales game as cameo. ltlt Hes probably the most memorable character from my Destiny playthrough. I think Ive told the story before but Ill always take an excuse to share my misery again. Shortly before The Scene I found an armour for Leon called Vermillion and I thought it was funny that Leons name ended the same way so I decided to manually rename him the first half as a nickname. So Leon became Vermy and then.................. they split up and the second half of the game began. And Leon never rejoins your party after that point. And so you never have a chance to rename him. And then he sacrifices himself for you I played DC. And then for the ENTIRE REST OF THE GAME whenever the party mourns him they mourn Vermy and I fucking lost it every single time.spoiler Destiny I will never ever EVER be able to take Leon Magnus seriously for the rest of my whole life. rip vermyspoiler Destiny,tales,dc874hz,2,t5_2t9fb

From a business perspective a lot of companies are a bit gunshy about Nintendo after the WiiU and to some extent even the Wii. A port is a relatively safe way to stick your toes in the water. Its relatively lowrisk to create so if it flops because the Switch flops youre not out much and it could sell well.Im not saying HALFLIFE  CONFIRMED! but Id actually put a port over a new game at about . That said from their perspective it need not be a port of Vesperia per se a port of Xillia would work the same way for them.

10803750,0,t1_ddubdzx,There are a lot but among the main series there are  of them. If youre curious Berseria is actually a distant prequel to Zestiria so when you beat the game if you want to get depressedsee more of the same universe check out Zestiria. Zestiria however is no where near as good as Berseria though and is widely regarded as one of the worst games in the series Berseria was made to fix Zestirias mistakes so you may or may not like it.If youre really interested in the rest of the series though check out Tales of Symphonia Tales of the Abyss and Tales of Vesperia. Those are the holy trinity and typically fans like one of those three best. Personally I think Abyss is the best game ever made. For most new fans the recommended order to play the games are Symphonia gt Abyss gt Vesperia gt Graces F gt Xilla  and  gt Zestiria. Basically release order. You can sprinkle in some of the side games or portable games too like Symphonia  Tales of Hearts R Legendia etc.,tales,ddubwzq,2,t5_2t9fb

10850707,0,t3_5v4deg,This response will contain spoilers...since its basically a spoiler question.Your spoiler tag is backwards. Flip the spoiler with the hint. The details are on the sidebar a little ways down but its there.To answer your question...Heldalf vs Velvets actual power is not really displayed in the context in which youre talking about. Its simply their malevolence that they are giving off. Velvet implies close to the end of the game that shes been trying to contain all of her malevolence including the malevolence that she sucks from daemons throughout the course of the story. This is implied in the cutscene prior to Mount Killaraus when Laphicet combs her hair. Near the end she becomes unable to contain it which is why she starts glowing with malevolence traditional daemon style.Theres no indication or reason Heldalf would do the same. The big key difference between the two of them is that Velvet didnt give up hope on humanity. It was quite the contrary. She just hated Artorius so much that it opened her up to Innominats influence who turned her into a Therion. In fact theres no implication that she was guaranteed to turn into a daemon without his influence although she probably would have lets be honest here.Maotelus is just like all Malakhim. Just because hes an Emperian doesnt mean hes not still a Malakhim. Which means hes extremely susceptible to malevolence. Heldalf took no measures to contain it which made it very easy to infect malakhim. Maotelus was observing the terrible things that Heldalf did which released a ton of malevolence none of which Heldalf attempted to contain which allowed it to spread like wildfire and infect Maotelus. This doesnt mean hes stronger than anyone in particular it just means that he didnt try to contain it.,tales,ddz69dc,2,t5_2t9fb

Of course there is no small amount of nostalgia too.I dont think many people consider it the best game. Best story or favorite game maybe. I know a lot of the flaws in Vesperia but I still consider it my favorite despite thinking Berseria is the better game. And sometimes people are prone to exaggeration and hyperbole yet others may just not be able to properly elucidate their position.Five hours is nothing in a  hour game especially considering Tales game are known and loved for subverting the story tropes and cliches it was seemingly earnestly using in the first half of the game. Im not saying you should absolutely go back if you didnt have fun but sometimes there is a payoff for suffering through some parts.

Unless a random Tales game ends up being about how the Orbus Barrier was created theres no way the games are connected.Its all just Easter Eggs for people who have played multiple Tales games. Just like how every Final Fantasy has Chocobos and every Dragon Quest has Slimes even though some DQs are sequelsprequels to others but not every single one.When a franchise has gotten to the size and count that series like DQ FF and Tales have it becomes a fun minigame for long time fans to find all the references.

In combat shes absolutely savage with awesome combos maybe second only to ludger.  Her development is handled well and she doesnt suffer from getting completely out shadowed by her cohorts.  The one negative thing I would say though is HER BLADE DOES NOT FIT IN THAT GAUNTLET.  NO MAAM  PAM!
