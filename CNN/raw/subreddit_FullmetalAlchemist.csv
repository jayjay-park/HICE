917205,0,t3_24m2be,In my years of study of the human body as a medical man and Alchemist I developed a theory about the failure of Human Transmutation. It isnt a problem of equivalent exchange what causes the rebound it is a problem with the first step of alchemy altogether  understanding. The scientific theorize of our world accustom for a metaphysical concept of the human being  the physical body and the metaphysical soul at such every Alchemist ever attempting human transmutation researched only the body while brushing of the soul as something unquantifiable ether not planing to create a specific soul or counting on some connection between the alchemist and the transmutated human being The Famous Elric brothers while transmutating there mother or Infamous Izumi Curtis while transmutating her child and that where the problem lies. The soul is the explanation as to what makes a human human the source of our emotion desires morals the source of what makes as a unique person and as naturalistic narcissistic spices we decided that is must be something magical unexplainable  nothing further of the truth. All this is enclosed in physical bounders in our brains.As a medical man working in the field hospitals during the Ishvallen Genocide I have seen all aspect of our humanity damaged or erased through brain trauma of specific regions. If this aspects of our humanity where dependent on something inmaterial such a think shouldnt occur. It stand to reason that the soul isnt something inmaterial it is just a very complex aspect of our brain and in here lies the problem of failed human transmutation an Alchemist attempting to create a human body has to have near perfect understanding of the complex anatomical and cellular structure of the brain and of its even complexer biochemistry and that just to create a blank human being.As stated in the Elric Brothers Journal transmutating a specific human soul is impossible to do do to the soul metaphysical aspects I dont agree. It is theoretical possible but practical impossible to transmute a specific human soul an Alchemist would have to had not only the wast and specific knowledge I already mentioned but also have a perfect knowledge of the exact biochemical state of that persons brain. Even if one could design a circle which incompensated the complexity of the human brain conceptualising the exact biochemical build up of a specific brain during an Alchemic transmutation is a task to great for any human mind.If my theory is accurate it should be possible to make a successful human transmutation having a living human being as a template using it to transmute a perfect replica a clone or just simply deconstructing and reconstructing that living human avoiding the lack of exact understanding of the human mind. As of now I have never heard of such an incident happen an as such my speculation is just a theory and my ethics as a medical man forbids me to conduct such an experiment because it would mean gambling with a human beings live. It still remains intriguing thought...quick edit,FullmetalAlchemist,ch8jj1h,3,t5_2t27s

If you are having trouble generating ideas it can also help you build them out. To get that first spark going ask yourself questions such as in this case why are these two fighting? What do they have in common?  What do we know they want? Where are they fighting?  Analyze their known battle strengths and weaknesses. Take notes. Then write.  Dont just stare at a blank page and try to fill it with story. Of course nothing comes then. Be a detective. Ask your characters questions. Hope that helps!,FullmetalAlchemist,cl0toy5,2,t5_2t27s

2651982,0,t3_2qc01d,I cant say Ive watched Naruto so I dont know how FMAB compares. But this has to be my favorite anime ever. The characters are amazing. There are multiple enemies and you find their reasons for everything they do. Theres no evil just for the sake of evil. They all have a reason for acting the way they do. Trust me you will grow to love each character for their own reasons. There are a ton of plot twists you will not see coming. I wont give you any spoilers. The story is set up in such a way that it raises so many questions about character backstories future plot points and in general whats going on. Theres plenty of humor in the show and it is definitely needed. Brotherhood can be really dark but the humor shows up in unexpected places. Plus there are a few running jokes that you see pop up even close to the end.Fight sequences are always intense and unpredictable. Ed frequently gets himself in tough situations and has to fight his way out leading to some really unique strategies. I wont give examples because that could lead to massive spoilers. Seriously. Theres not a whole lot of romance going on in the anime. But it doesnt need it. Theres a little bit here and there but the anime is too dark and tense to allow for sappy romance. And its not a bad thing. Although some crushes come to light in a humorous way and can really lighten the mood.As for feels well... theres so much... Like I said you get attached to all the characters and you see humans that are corrupted with power driven to near insanity angry and vengeful but you can see theyre all human. Naruto has shaped a lot of lives and taught a ton of lessons. FMAB does the same. The characters teach you this You have to figure it out. Stand up and walk. Keep moving forward. Youve got two good legs. So get up and use them. Youre strong enough to make your own path. They teach about sacrifice and working to get what you want and need instead of being lazy. They teach so many good life lessons its hard to catch them all. In the end why should you watch FMAB? Because you get an incredible story with so many memorable characters. You get an experience like no other when you first watch it. I wish I could go back and watch it for the first time all over again. All I can say is watch it. You wont be disappointed.sidenote the  anime not Brotherhood differs from the manga after a certain point. Its good in its own right but the ending is much less satisfying than Brotherhood. I still heavily recommend both.,FullmetalAlchemist,cn4qtlg,1,t5_2t27s

Maybe it was because of the fact that I saw Brotherhood first and made assumptions at subtleties in the way they interacted in  but I just thought for sure I noticed even more connection there which made the almost lack of caring they both displayed at the end of Shamballa all the more jarring. As for another movie being redundant I have to agree that it probably would be. But theres still a shred of me that thinks that it could really be a big love letter to the fans if they managed to have a good idea and did come back to the  plot line. Judging by the comments it seems people are largely split about the ending to Shamballa and I think that could be corrected.

After he says this truth starts laffing saying that that is the right answer. I think this shows him sacrifising the idea that his alchemy is a all powerful force that drives everything.

Lower arms were made from a patterns found online also covered in fiberglass. Cosplayer is in a  point harness that attaches to an aluminum frame.

9445086,0,t1_d9c1430,gt Why was Envys original form that little green wormI thought it was his true form rather than his original form. Like the form that most truly represented Envy himself a pathetic grotesque little being. As a shapeshifter his mind shapes his body so anything other than his most accurate form would require energy to maintain and thats why he becomes the worm when he runs out of gas.gt Why did Greed share a body with Ling?This one was explicitly explained actually! Ling allowed Greed to take over his body so that his soul wouldnt be destroyed in a hopeless battle for dominance intending to regain control as soon as he got an opportunity. Presumably in every other case the human resisted and had their soul crushed by the Homunculus.gt Can a Homunculus only be a sin?I think they can be any aspect of Father but he chose to only rid himself of sins in order to become more perfect losing his personality and love of life in the process.  gt Whats the difference between HohoFather and a Homunculus?A Homunculus is a Philosophers Stone in a body while Hoho and Father are Philosophers Stones?

It was interesting too when you think about how Pride ended up in the reverse of that scenario with Father. With Pride turning Roy into a sacrifice at the expense of Prides body deterioratingIt actually makes it kind of hard to watch him cry out for his mother when Edward crushed his body I think in that instance he was thinking about how she was the only person who ever shielded him from danger and was crying for her because of how scared he was.,FullmetalAlchemist,d9nz02a,3,t5_2t27s
