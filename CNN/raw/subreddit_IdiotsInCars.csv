5741686,0,t3_3qqv4u,In all honesty the truck driver probably doesnt even know that that car is there.  I remember a story from my dad about a fellow truck driver being cut off by a small sized car. Since the cab of the truck was so tall he didnt see the car or that it had applied its brakes. Anyway he ended up pushing the car down the highway for a couple miles thinking only that his brakes were acting up when in reality he was pushing a car and helping someone crap their pants instead.TLDR truck drivers cant always see everything directly in from of them.,IdiotsInCars,cx8t8go,9,t5_3aimx

7582914,0,t1_d344o27,A lot of weight is a relative term. lbs is NOTHING when youre talking about towing. A sailboat of this size is probably in the neighborhood of  depending on whats inside. Thats not taking in to consideration the trailer weight.   Furthermore its not the power to pull that matters as much as the power to stop. If this car tried to stop suddenly it would boil its brakes and plow through whatever was in front of it.,IdiotsInCars,d3452ae,1,t5_3aimx
7583442,0,t1_d33ynsc,Just a speculation but maybe they travel at slower speeds accelerate more slowly change the transmission fluid more often and have a transmission fluid cooler.  With those things in mind it doesnt seem very far outside the realm of possibility that you could haul pretty hefty loads so long as the speeds were low and gearing was used right.  The aerodynamic drag would mean getting that setup up to higher speeds would require wildly more power and might over heat the motor without radiator modifications but at lower speeds this might not be much of an issue.  Likely the real concern would be very steep routes and heat but perhaps theyve routed around that sort of issue or simply dont have that kind of terrain to be worried about.  Hard to say or know but at least there isnt a guy holding onto the trailer hanging from the trunk  like this or something.A lot of vehicles likely have certain hauling weight limits in mind because they assume the weight limits are what can be used at a typical top traveling speed for the vehicle in less than ideal conditions.  But if you are smart you can likely use a vehicle to haul insane amounts of weight.  Id be especially less concerned if I had an active cooler fan technique with a way to keep an eye on certain temperatures.,IdiotsInCars,d34781o,4,t5_3aimx

10514899,0,t1_dczxyhp,No hes actually right.  If you turn the key off you cut accessory power to the vehicle speed sensor ECM and cluster  This sensor sends a signal called a PPM or Pulse Per Mile signal to the gauge cluster.  The cluster interprets this information for the speedometer and odometer.  Key OFF No mileage.  Key on engine off will rack up mileage.,IdiotsInCars,dczz5os,4,t5_3aimx

Park in a regular spot near the entrance and take your chances knowing the people of Walmart is a real thing. . Park in the farthest corner of the lot where nobody is around and the people of Walmart can randomly do shit without anyone seeing . Park as far as possible from the entrance where there are a lot of cars driving by and risk having the people of Walmart post your douchebag parking on RedditI choose  ,IdiotsInCars,de11utl,46,t5_3aimx

11031324,0,t3_5xitkj,Almost ran into this idiot yesterday. There are two northbound lanes on the east side of the median two southbound lanes on the west side. I was driving north in the left lane and found myself facing this genius driving toward me. He pointed at the right lane indicating that he felt I was in the wrong lane. I pointed at him and then at the southbound lanes. His expression went from outrage to embarrassment in a heartbeat then he slowly backed up as his passengers laughed their butts off at him and I snapped this photo.,IdiotsInCars,deidiw3,50,t5_3aimx

11148359,0,t3_5ylp1b,The knowledge that the driver is holding another vehicle up through their own mistake has taken priority in their brain so any spatial awareness they may or may not have had to begin with is not getting any cycles. it happens statistically far more with women than men according to the insurance industry. If you think this is hogwash the most common way Ive found it manifests is in parallel parking when your alone vs when there is traffic and you are being observed.edit Incidentally if anyone knows a word or phrase to describe this situation Id love to put a name to it. English doesnt have enough phrases for oddly specific but widely relatable situations that make us human.,IdiotsInCars,devnknv,3,t5_3aimx

I had a commute that if I was doing it at am would take  minutes but if I picked a lane and stayed there would take  during rush hour. There were some very simple clean safe invisible strategies to put far fewer cars in between me and my destination and got me there usually in about  minutes.,IdiotsInCars,dg637dj,3,t5_3aimx
