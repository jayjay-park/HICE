7980591,0,t3_4ivbut,Make sure the dry food you buy is over  protein and grainfree.Make sure the wet food you buy is also grainfree.Make sure actual meat is the first ingredient listed on both types of food.Dont feed too much fish theres a concern over heavy metal poisoning. Fish is okay sometimes but not the majority of the time.Make sure both kinds of food have nutritional information on the package as well as number of calories. Without this information it is a guarantee they are hiding something from you that is not good for your cat.Try to feed your cat as much wet food as possible figure out a routine that works for your schedule. For me this is a half can of wet food in the morning a half can before bed and a third of a cup of dry food during the day.Thats  calories from wet food and  from dry. Once you figure out how many calories are in the food you are giving him you can Google to see how many calories your cat should be getting per day. For my pound indoor domestic shorthair that is  calories.Try to have a running water fountain for your cat separated from the food. Food source and water source must be separate from each other or else they will not drink.Do not under any circumstances buy cat food from a human food store. They notoriously sell the worst food out there protein content is usually below  and the rest of it is grain and carbohydrates two things your cat never ever eats in the wild which will most certainly reduce your cats life span.,CatAdvice,d4d3ddf,1,t5_2sn56
8996559,0,t3_5323xu,I would consult a vet about a sedative if he hates it as much as you are describing. It would be better for both of you. Also get a large dog crate where he has room for a bed or blanket and a small litter box. I agree with the Feliway Spray for calming. There is also this Pressure can really help anxiety in both animals and humans. ,CatAdvice,d7t8wfb,1,t5_2sn56
9263959,0,t1_d8oxb92,Cats dont actually need dry food. Keep offering wet. If you want to offer dry  weeks based on kittens size is safe. Some kittens especially little girl kittens can have smaller mouths than other kittens.  I have a  year old cat for an example who is still the size she was at around  months old  she has a tiny mouth for an adult cat and getting her adult teeth was incredibly painful for her with that tiny mouth.Amount you can try free feeding. Otherwise the bag will have instructions. Pick a good quality all stages food high in protein low in carbs or a kitten food. You said she has fleas?  Go get a flea comb. Comb the kitten and have a bowl of soapy Dawn dish detergent works hot water near by to clean the comb off with between combings. And a towel or paper towel to dry the comb on. Comb the kitten everyday maybe even twice a day until you can get a spot on treatment like Revolution.  Kitten will need to be dewormed for roundworms hookworms Revolution takes care of these two and tapeworms these need a separate pill. Physically removing as many fleas as you can now will help the kitten. A kitten with a lot of fleas can become anemic. Combing will also remove flea dirt flea poop get a kitten used to being combed and handled and serve as bonding time. You can also start trimming the tips of her claws now human nail clipper can work or at least playing with her feet so she is used to them being touched and held. This will make it easier to trim her claws in the future.   You can also try taking a warm damp washcloth and wiping her a little since she wont be grooming herself yet. This is great to do after feeding since kittens can be messy eaters. Itll mimic a mother cats cleaning and may help the kitten bond. The flea comb will be good enough for combing a kitten coat unless the kitten has longhair which would take a while to grow in anyways. Longhaired cats can have some of the same grooming tools used for shorthairs but need a quick combing with a detangling comb first this could be a cheap comb for humans.  Furminator is a bladed brush that works for removing excess undercoat. Rubber brushes like a ZoomGroom will grab some of the guard coat and undercoat. The flea comb retains its place as a flea monitoring tool use after visits to the vet can be used after other grooming brushes to pick up stray hair and can be used as a smoother comb. ,CatAdvice,d8q9u1m,2,t5_2sn56
9640003,0,t3_5d30uu,is he neutered? Hes probably bored play with him when hes being quiet. Hes very young and needs a lot of play time exploring interesting stuff around the house. Also change his toys once in a while cats love variety,CatAdvice,da1buii,1,t5_2sn56

9713761,0,t1_daaf418,yep. my cat didnt eat for  days but that vet got her eating again just in time. and its actually the overweight cats that are most at risk.   if an overweight cat stops eating they are at a greater risk of hepatic lipidosis fatty liver. good luck.,CatAdvice,daafjd4,1,t5_2sn56
10005574,0,t3_5ivv7q,She is just being a kitty.  My cat does it with this fur toy she has.  We call it her bunny.  When she brings it to us we just praise her for being such a good hunter.  It seems to satisfy her. ,CatAdvice,dbbr73n,2,t5_2sn56
10102503,0,t3_5kiwel,Is she spayed?My guess is shes not feeling secure in her territory inside the house. If she hasnt done this before maybe something scared her and now she doesnt feel ok inside and has to mark everything. The peeing could be her trying to say that she owns this territory. You could try to help her by Placing more cat trees around so that she could jump higher See if there are areas in your house that are very high and could be accessible by the cat like high shelves top of the kitchen cabinets etc. Make a way for her to reach those places safely. Or install new cat shelves around the house if thats possible. This would allow her to have a top view of the rooms and in that way claim her territory. If her litter box is covered  take it off If the litter box is hidden somewhere in the corner  take it out place it somewhere more exposed in the main area of the house but in a place where she will not be disturbed while doing her business. If its possible place additional one litter box somewhere in another main area.   Keep her occupied by playing,CatAdvice,dboda7l,2,t5_2sn56
10765664,0,t1_ddm8xrg,I agree!! I was in the exact same situation as you OP. Adopted my first girl in July and my second girl in Sept. it took a few weeks for them to accept each other but they are bffs now. Since then we have moved from an apartment to a house and they love the extra room to chase each other and play. I know it wont magically work like that every time but it definitely sounds like your kitty wants some company. ,CatAdvice,ddqecpc,1,t5_2sn56
11447183,0,t3_63d0ep,How old is the cat? When we adopted our kittens they were about  months old and it took a month or two for their tummies to settle downmature. Seafood? Apparently some cats can be sensitiveallergic to fish. Try switching to chicken or turkey for a while at least a week and see if that helps.From what Ive heard its a bad sign if a cat acts lethargic. If it is happening a lot I would go to the vet. ,CatAdvice,dftj10c,1,t5_2sn56
11496697,0,t3_642z66,I just adopted my kitty last month and went through this same exact thing! Try relocating her to the bathroom and setting up a barrier or just keep the door closed all the time if you can. Put all the food water litter etc. in there. This makes it much easier for the cat to become more comfortable with its surroundings and itll be much easier for you guys to bond. My cat was terrified of being out in my studio apartment at first and never used the litter box until I relocated him to my bathroom. One month later and now he wakes me up in the middle of the night for cuddles! Just make sure to be patient and if after another night she still refuses to use anything you might want to bring her to a vet just to get checked out. ,CatAdvice,dfz5euu,3,t5_2sn56
11645365,0,t1_dgfzu9q,The food youre feeding advertises urinary health benefits which is good and even one wet meal per day is better than none.  If you can go all grain free even better.  Filtered water is also preferable over tap.  No need for fancy bottled water using a Brita filter is fine.    Budget constraints are tough I know.   Keep up the hydration as it sounds like youre doing well with follow up regularly with the vet and check the litter box daily for any changes. Dont be afraid to bug your vets office with any questions.If you have to leave him with someone again leave detailed explicit instructions for his food amp urine monitoring. You also may want to try if at all possible to put a small amount of money aside here and there in case he does end up needing surgery to widen the urethra.  Hopefully he wont ever have this recur again but in case he does youll be more financially prepared. ,CatAdvice,dgg0l0c,1,t5_2sn56
