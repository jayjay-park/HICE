Its totally proper grammar because Im smart.FTFYYoure smart alright being smart with your mother.  Now go up to your room and dont even think about bringing up your phone with you. By the way I know why all those socks under your bed are all crusty. I understand you have urges at this age and I didnt want to embarrass you before but now Im going to tell you to wash it yourself whenever I find one.,im14andihaveenemies,crmyi5l,11,t5_38e97
