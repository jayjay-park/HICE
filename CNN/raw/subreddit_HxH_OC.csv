4604857,0,t1_ctb0qyc,I was actually supposed to change the armour thing and so I have however I disagree with most points the cube is specified as huge so It will not be small. His hatsu do not last long at all and he can only use most of them  or  times meaning he is screwed if he doesnt win in that time limit. The character is not OP in anyway shape or form due to the very hindering restrictions placed by the submitter.As a minor change I specified the break level for chains which was an oversight on my part.,HxH_OC,ctb10u5,1,t5_395mg

7959066,0,t3_4o917k,The strategy Ulix will use will be very similar to SPOILER Chrollo SPOILER over No doubt Milluku will attempt to charge Ulick as Milluku is a melee character but Ulick will get away and run intov the crowd by creating a smokescreen of spores with his Seed Sword and manipulating the near by judge with his vines. This will buy Ulick enough time to blend into the crowd by stealing some clothes.Milluku is quiet strong and fast so he will be able to get into the crowd decently quickly even with the deterrents. Ulick will place seeds on crowd memebers to get them to attack Milluku on two crowd members will each have an Arm of the Jungle attached which Ulick will activate when Milluku does not expect it. This will allow Ulick even more time and he will be completely hidden in the crowd when Milluku doesnt expect it Ulick will shoot a seed with his sniper rifle which will cause milluku to begin too loose blood. This will give away Ulicks location but by this time Ulick will be far enough away that he can land two more shots before Milluku can catch up. He will also be far enough away to put up a few traps. When Milluku comes charging in Ulick will have two Arms of the Jungle placed on the floor these arms will grab the legs of Milluku. Hell also have  new crowd memenbers which can dog pile milluku. Now that milluku is so occupied Ulick will get a hit in with his seed sword and run away again to blend into the crowd. To repeat a similar plan until Milluku is very weak.TLDRUlick will win becauseHis abilities are great for this battlefieldMilluku lacks endurance and cannot take a prolonged chanse getting hit by sniper bulletsUlick has superior intellegnce which will allow him to edit his plan on the fly,HxH_OC,d4aoa04,1,t5_395mg

11009758,0,t1_defx8xc, Days after the death of Shivra NyarlAfter a day of unsuccesfull work finding Zero walked around town doing nothing bored out of his mind he decided to explore the Island fully after walking around for  minutes he suddenly noticed he was being followed the person following him hadnt been following him a minute ago and Zero noticed him pretty quickly not because he was particularly focused or anything but his follower was pretty incompetent and obvious.Zero looked at his direction and his follower decided to walk in another direction now Zero was following him after walking around for  minutes Zero arrived at a desolate area the guy following him walked up to someone behind some trees it looked as he recieved a package and then left running.Zero realized that the guy following him was paid so the man in the shadows could be alone with Zero.So... what do you want? Zero asked to the man behind the trees who took a step forward revealing himself he was slightly taller than Zero bald he wore sunglasses and a suit pretty normal looking businessman if it werent for two details first his suit was covered with armor platings all around and second  metal pipes were stuck inside his back as if he was impaled by them.Im here to bring you back by force if neccesary. Zero instantly conjured a coin in his hand he could already sense the danger his man posed to his life.Bring me back to where?.. you know i dont really remember all that much maybe you could help we could use your head as a crystal ball to see the past and the future.Your taunts are meaningless this is the last warning come with me.Im afraid ill have to decline your offer im pretty happy with where i am right now besides i have to work as a waiter in a restaurant tomorrow see you later Zero grinned at the bald man tauting people was almost as fun as fighting to him Zero began walking backwards looking at the bald man after  steps he started to turn around.You brought this upon yourself kid... Said the bald man as he grabbed the tip of one of the metal bars in his back he took a piece off it didnt look like it was ripped off it was as if the piece had been perfectly cut on that exact spot right as he grabbed it.The metal started to change shapes turning into a hand size needle like object the man threw it at Zero who dodged the attack as he flipped the coin before Zero could regain his footing the needle changed directions in mid air Zero barely managed to move and the needle cut his right arm with his left hand he grabbed the coin in mid air as the bald man grabbed another metal bar shaping it as a sword and jumping at Zero extremely fast.Zero without realizing said his mission out loudsurvive. As he thinked to himself please be angel please be angel please be angel. Just as the armor began forming around him the man landed right next to Zero who managed to sidestep the swing The sword then morphed again its whole edge fliping in the ground changing directions to where Zero was Just before the sword hit the angel armor covered Zeros whole body who moved behind the man jumping and kicking him in the back of his head.The man barely moved.Hmm not bad. Said the man as he saw Zeros speed.Zero continued with a barrage of attacks quickly dodging a swing attack by the man punching him in the face with his right hand then rising his left knee into the mans stomach planting his right foot in the ground Zero turned his waist transitioning from the knee hit into a sweeping kick sending the man into the ground Zero prepared to punch him again in the ground as the man made all the metal tubes in his back come off separating them into dozens of small neddle like proyectiles.Zero spread his wings and aimed to the sky as the needles followed his every move  chasing him across the sky not until he went above the clouds and the man lost vision did the proyectiles stop.Zero was in a corner but this allowed him to think clearly and focus on the situation that man was controlling a lot of small objects with a lot of precision from a great distance there has to be a downside... Zero could only think of one thing so he put his idea to the test if he was wrong this could lead to his death but it was the only way to beat this guy he had probably gone trough experiments similiar to those Zero went trough that means that he was with the group that dit that to himself if he let him escape the whole group would know about Zeros whereabouts and they would come for him in large groups if he took him out now he could win time until they found him again.Taking a deep breath Zero dived at full speed against the man dodging as many needles as possible but the small cuts all around his body already started to pile up in a matter of seconds he was already right next to the man who couldnt dodge fast enough Zero punched him and kept on attacking him again and again just as he tought the man had to be really focused to control that much objects he could still control a handfull of them but without the same precision as before.Zero continued the barrage of attacks as the man tried to defend himself while simultaniously piercing and cutting Zero with as many needles as he could.After a couple seconds of this Zero realized he would bleed out before taking the guy out he barely even flinched at his attacks without anything else to do Zero conjured a coin in his palm Grabbing the man and throwing him into the sky Zero kept making the guy go higher and higher grabbing and throwing him while he punched and kicked after getting to the clouds Zero threw the coin in the direction of the ground and kept attacking the man after a few seconds he stopped as he grabbed the man by his head for aproximately one second Zero was armorless as he deactivated his angel armor and waited for the coin to land conjuring his devil armor In this second the man managed toPierce his right shoulder cut his left arm three times cut his torso  times and his right leg two times Zero flinched at the pain but a moment later the devil armor now covered his body grabbing the mans head with all his force he could feel as the mans skull slowly cracked under his strenght.After a few seconds Zero could already see the ground aiming the man straight into the ground Zero fell on top of the man breaking both his legs but leaving the man as nothing more than a pulp of broken bones and flesh.Zero laughed as he slowly bleed out in the crater that the fall had made Its the third time already that he had to do something like this but it didnt look like hed survive this one.Unknown to him his tatto slowly shifted from a  to a  minutes later Zero Died.He then woke up at the same spot  hours later.He now remembered everything before the experiments his real name His name was... Dave? That didnt sound cool at all he remembered how different he was before compared to now then he realized he was alive how? it was imposibble.Then he remember some things about the experiments he didnt fully remember yet but he knew the true purpose of his tattoo. He couldnt tell anyone not yet.He decided to keep his name as Zero the man he once was Dave didnt really exist anymore but hed make sure to remember what happened and why.Then he decided to modify his hatsu slightly he could somehow feel more powerfull after reviving.He stood up and went back to the town looking at the corpse of the man he fought in what appeared to be his tight a tatto of a  was faintly recognizable.LeL its the first time i reach the character limit so i decided so split the extra story apart from the sheet.This explains why he changed his hatsu and why his stats changed fromchange to success to ,HxH_OC,defxbpp,2,t5_395mg

As the only OC with riding experience he should have an advantage in the race. gt Hes decent at horse riding since its the primary mode of travel in his country. Hes not juiced hes not taken the pill and his mount is not under any influences. Due to having grown up in the Republic of Rokario which as part of the Mitene Union has forsaken technology he has no concept of video games. Since he doesnt even consider the idea that everyone is anything but real he will treat everything seriously. Not wanting to murder anyone over this hell try to shoot his gun just ahead of the other persons bird to startled it in the case someone tries to attack him. Horses have to be trained to not be startled by gun fire. In the barn hell look for something to cover his birds ears that way his own mount doesnt get startled by the sound. There are horse plugs for if your firing from a horse so there should be bird plugs. remaining examines including himself have  or lower resolve. So while he wont make it through quickly he should finish faster than them due to experience.Regarding the mines with his skills in riding and decent intelligence Artemis should be able to steer around the mines with relative ease assuming they are easy to spot.

11555469,0,t1_dg5leay,Heres the other. Name YuyaAge Occupation Ophiuchus Mercenary Aquarius  Infiltration ExpertHeight Weight  poundsLook Yuya stands out like a sore thumb. Standing at  with a very lanky but busty build. She has very long legs compared to the rest of her body. She has tan skin and dresses colorfully with a leather jacket a green and white croptop and cargo pants so poofy shes practically drowning in it. Her hair is shaven on the sides with a long unstyled green mohawk. She has numerous piercings on her ears nose and tongue. Her tongue is also freakishly long.Background At a young age Yuya alongside many others was kidnapped by Nen specialists who wanted to twist her mind and body into an assassin. She took quite well to it in some ways taking to the physical training quite well and learned the basics of Nen but when it came to mental training it turned out she just had too much willpower to break easily. She went along with their training pretending to be the perfect assassin but she reached her limit when subjected to a test designed to break a persons sense of self. She nearly lost her own identity but broke free instead. She proceeded to come up with a few more Hatsus and left to find her own place in the world. Eventually she joined the Ophiuchus Mercenaries a wellknown all girl charitable mercenary group of outcasts.Personality Yuya is Punk AF. Shes very open and accepting towards everyone especially the weirdoes and judges people only by their actions and beliefs not their appearance or anything else. Contrary to popular belief she doesnt hate authority. As one of the top  members of the Ophiuchus mercenaries she IS authority. Instead she strictly believes any authoritys job is to look out for the little guy and not lord their power over others. Yuya doesnt care much for social norms and does what she wants but is considerate towards people she trusts. Towards people she doesnt trust or is actively engaged in combat with she explicitly tries to make them uncomfortable and boy is she good at it! She swings both ways and unlike Fireza who she has definitely ended up in bed with at least once is VERY flirty and can and will flirt with her opponents in a domineering way.Stats Realized Aura Max Control Proficiency Tech App Physical Strength Speed Endurance Reflex Mental Intelligence Intuition Logic Will Assassin Empowerment  Enhancment  TransmuterThe one Hatsu she learned as part of her assassin training. Originally solely an Enhancer technique shes modified it to include aura transmuted to have the properties of acid to loosen her joints. This has several effects it increases her strength and speed but also greatly increases her flexibility and allows her to extend her limbs a little. The flexibility increase is enough to the point that she can slide through a tube with just half a foot in diameter or easily pull herself free from handcuffs and bindings. The limitation is it causes her pain and extended use will leave her feeling quite sore weakening her based off of how long she overused it for.Acid Spray  TransmuterYuya transmutes her aura to have the properties of acid creating huge amounts of sizzling green fluid. The acid is quite strong able to quickly corrode metal until it becomes brittle and useless or melt through rock wood and any organic material. However as a limitation it is significantly less effective against anything alive or rather its far stronger against anything that ISNT alive. After a few seconds it will leave a rash and further exposure will cause blisters and bleeding but it takes a few minutes of constant exposure before permanent damage will occur. However its quite dangerous if swallowed or if it gets into your eyes and it IS a fluid and will need to be wiped off of course. Yuya can create the acid and fire it with high pressure but once released she cannot control it and it will hurt Yuya just as it hurts her opponent. Yuya can cause the acid to dissipate at will and it will also dissipate on its own slowly over time or quickly if Yuya is not nearby.Scorpions Sting  TransmuterYuya transmutes her aura on her arm or legs into a blade made of her acid. Just like Acid Spray it has the same limitation much stronger against anything not alive. However while she will have a much easier time cleaving through solid nonliving material its still strong enough to cause serious harm to anyone she strikes with it. Plus with her long limbs that can be extended through Assassin Empowerment she has a fairly wide zone of control.Experience Yuya is very stealthy and prefers fighting from the cover of darkness.,HxH_OC,dg5teao,2,t5_395mg
