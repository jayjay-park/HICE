3842914,0,t1_cqub8so,Bruce Schneider is respect in several circles specially those of security. I cant name a computer scientist that havent heard of him and even ACM Queue links to his blog posts. So I would consider his opinion about the subject.Moxie and tptacek hiwever... Never heard of. So before considering their opinion I would like to double check what they say. As I told you I am not a security expert and my knowledge is very limited in the field. But as a premise they are simply one more voice in the ocean of bloggers that I dont take by grant.But after some bad blood between some security experts and Telegram team I am very suspicious of any analysis. I believe in facts if someone wins the crypto contest and I would like to see someone winning it! then I will believe it was broken. Otherwise I will have some good laughs from this discussion and be more concerned about what I share in my email than in my mobile messages.,Telegram,cqubqw6,3,t5_2zmr2

6159202,0,t1_cypodeq,Look buddy. You always say switch to signal. I already switched I support Signal for their philosophy by installing the product. But the problem is nobody else in my contacts use Signal. Hell I might be among the handful of people even aware of Signal in my country. So I am obliged to use Telegramwhatsapp. That being the case our only hope seems to raise our voice and draw the Telegram developers attention to these issues. I believe once they see a strong desire to privacy from their user base they will change. So keep raising your voice. Keep talking about privacy issues of Telegram. We cannot get this issue forgotten.edit typo,Telegram,cypqkes,3,t5_2zmr2

Additionally since five months ago Telegram made some changes to their reporting system so you can now appeal bans through spambot IIRC which may be the cause for no response.

Has Durov or Telegram done anything to give reason to doubt their privacy claims? Ive not seen it. What I know of Durov hes a Libertarian type of person. He mistrusts governments I cant blame him. and built Telegram as insulation between the private lives of the masses and government snooping. It seems the product of having grown up under and worked with the Russian government during VKontakte days and the fallout from the Snowden info dump.,Telegram,dda5mc3,12,t5_2zmr2
10686449,0,t1_ddhyxx7,On slack I noticed that not many users of my current team make threads but if someone creates one everybody keeps using it once it exists. I feel like they found the right balance of offering the feature for power users but hiding it a bit so creating a thread doesnt happen on accident. It would probably need to exist additionally to the current reply tool to not confuse users who prefer a quote reply maybe replies could be turned into a thread with a long press?. I cant even imagine how much effort it would be to implement but it would be a nice business feature or for groups of friends who discuss several things at the same time. ,Telegram,ddi86v5,1,t5_2zmr2
