2608179,0,t1_cmyzch5,ok sorry I went offline for a bit.  So i have gig internet service which looks to me as a cate handoff.  my router netgear R  AC doesnt fit into the box in the closet.  my house is cate dual wires to multiple rooms.so female to female coupler lights out one cable to my office.  then that goes into my WAN port and i send my port back up into a switch in that closet.EDIT I worded this poorly I DONT want this to happening and its happening but i cant figure out where,cableadvice,cmz0ymd,1,t5_2y4i5

4896466,0,t1_cubm57b,This is beyond the scope or rcableadvice but you need to figure out if the performance connectivity issue is local or related to your internet access   Does it affect everyone at once or only a couple of people ? Does it affect local traffic or internet traffic ? Is the performance problem continuous or intermittent ?Then you could  Check the switch ports counters for errors that could indicate a duplex or cabling problem. Check your router linux gateway logs for error that could indicate discarded packets. Figure out the bandwidth utilization on access ports and on your internet access circuit. If you do not have graphs or a netflow collector configure a SPAN mirroring traffic to the gateway on a port connecting a laptop running wireshark it will let you extract stats identifying woh is sending the most traffic.Setting up a netlow export fron your router to a collector helps a lot troubleshooting performance problems but is overkill for a SMB.Good luck.,cableadvice,cubqldk,2,t5_2y4i5
5069727,0,t3_3ke0eg,STP is completely useless to you in this case. Buried underground outside you will have no meaningful interference at all. The dirt will provide WAY more shielding than the foil in STP.As others mentioned you would be better off with outdoor rated cable. However if you make sure you conduit is sealed well you should be fine. Remember though labor is much more expensive than the cable. Since its in conduit go ahead and use what you got for free and if you need to replace it later you can use it to pull the outdoor rated cable through.,cableadvice,cux3dqj,3,t5_2y4i5

5710882,0,t1_cx4ziwc,Because of differential signaling. The pairs are twisted around each other and use differential signaling to avoid interference. If you just put the pairs in however you want you may have degraded signal quality meaning shorter possible distances and slower speeds. ,cableadvice,cx4zo7l,3,t5_2y4i5

7228931,0,t3_4cqwup,The shielding in Cat  is for EMI not for high voltage. I dont think thats the best idea. It might work but that doesnt sound safe to me.,cableadvice,d1zvj6b,1,t5_2y4i5
7273113,0,t3_4ezu1f,Well you could get a probe and see if you can trace it through the walls. If it is in there you might not have much choice but to put a hole in your floor or wall. Some lances and string should help.NMB just means that its non metallic and rated to withstand  degrees Celsius and isnt necessarily coaxial cable please make sure to turn your power off before handling all of this.Its possible that the black cable you saw coming in was terminated somewhere and then a white cable was attached. So again a probe would help verify.Once coaxial cables go into a house they generally go straight to where the circuit breaker is before heading anywhere else.,cableadvice,d24wk8w,0,t5_2y4i5

9129585,0,t3_55b0y0,Honestly I wouldnt recommend making your own patch cables. Ive terminated lots and lots of cable and I wouldnt be comfortable with a rack patched over with selfmade patch cords. The reason being is that there is just too much room for error if your crimper sucks or you do it weak youll have poor contact. Not sure how many runs you have but if its anything over  it just wont be worth it because of the time spent and the cost of materials. Youll be buying cable boots rj tips and a crimper and gen you get to start making them. You can get patch cord dirt cheap and in any size you could possible want. It will look much cleaner and sleeker if you do it right and buy them plus it will be cost effective. Sorry if I sound like a downer this is my experience. ,cableadvice,d898oa8,3,t5_2y4i5
9145807,0,t1_d898m6u,I read through this a tad and yeah you are probably better off buying them.I dont have a link handy but I will find it there are plenty of places that have all sorts of different lengths down to the half inch. They may be a dollar or two more expensive but it will totally be worth it.Newbie or not I dont think it is ever worth it to make your own patch cables. Anything lower than ft and we just buy them.It really isnt about the learning curve or lack of experience. It also depends on how many you need to make too I guess....If you need  or less Id say at that point make them but once you start doing them a lot your fingers are going to KILL.Another thing worth mentioning is quality. Buying bulk cable whatever it is is generally for horizontal cabling not patch cabling ft or less with male connectors on them. Learning on how to terminate male RJ ends takes a bit of practice to get it right and sometimes can be VERY hard to notice your mistakes.So I guess the big question is how many cables do you need? Back in my newbie days I worked for a company that allowed me a LOT of free time.I was just learning cabling and termination and thought how GREAT it was going to be to make cables the PERFECT length. Never having to worry about it.After about a week I threw in the towel. Even excluding mistakes it still took up too much time to consider it a viable option.,cableadvice,d8bap24,1,t5_2y4i5
