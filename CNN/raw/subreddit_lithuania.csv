Im assuming youre going to the Vydnas gymnasium or the Herder pirmoji gymnasium. if its the latter Licht Liebe Leben!you get the joke once youre there. when youre in Silute Id defensibly recommend going on a boat trip to the Curonian spit and in early spring just enjoy the warm flood waters p.the altar in the main church is quite worthy of a wee visit if you actually manage to get in. I know that the prospect might sound boring but It actually it worth a visit the main fresco is very unique. if you have any specific questions just ask away. ,lithuania,cgpu4m8,2,t5_2qj20

If you want to say that cold drinks cause or even assist a viral infection your entire premise is ludicrous. The only reason why winter seems to be peak cold season is because people lock themselves up together in confined spaces with little to no fresh cold air being exchanged.The simple fact is that simply washing ones hands with soap and water regularly is more than  times more effective in reducing the spread of colds and bacteria than any scarf or sweater ever was.What is perhaps the funniest correlation I can take away from this argument is that public health and life expectancy in Lithuania were greatly increased around the time that refrigeration and yes cold drinksbecame commonplace.Now I can understand on several levels why some people dont want ice in their drinks again based on some old superstition considering our scientific reality but thats another story with some hints of truth behind it.And if you want to see total tards watch the idiots who will tell you that being cold is very bad yet these idiots go into sauna and then roll in snow or go in very cold water. ,lithuania,d7ro2cu,2,t5_2qj20
