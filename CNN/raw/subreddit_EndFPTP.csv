I havent found an answer as to why shes choosing ranked if its not  the best method or whatever but at least shes starting the conversation.  can the bills pass?  if she gets bernielevel support then maybe.,EndFPTP,d5zex2e,3,t5_3fo0j

9621305,0,t3_5cry06,gt Everyone signing onto the interstate compact would have to use approval voting. The compact triggers immediately. Electoral votes are assigned to the approval vote winner only among states signed onto the compact. That would be utter BS. The states that sign on would only pay attention to the other states that signed on?NO WAY. Simply containing this proposal without saying its horrible makes this article horrible.The actual interstate voting compact people have said that they can accomodate other voting systems with other states voting laws specifying the interpretation of their votes for purposes of the compact.That is around  fairer than this proposal.gt As a quick dismissal note that the alternative of rankedchoice voting would not work because its ballot data needs to come together at one location a logistical nightmare with this approachOnly IRV not other ranked ballots.And this is Electology.org?,EndFPTP,d9z0va5,2,t5_3fo0j

10336386,0,t1_dcfc3ob,Yeah your thinking is totally right. And Ive certainly seen people learn about the problems with IRV and change their minds its just that FairVote keeps putting out their propaganda not because they are totally malicious although they seem intellectually dishonest. They put out their stuff because I think theyve convinced themselves that score voting is broken and pushed on it so hard they arent openminded any more.Anyway the extent of the legitimate strategic thing is exactly what I said before consider a twocandidate race. everyone accepts both candidates but the overall score would give candidate A . and candidate B .. Candidate As supporters are happy with any outcome but do prefer A so they realize that honestly scoring candidate B just makes it less likely for A to win so they give B a  even though they like B.Now I think people will feel shitty about scoring candidate B at  if they actually like them. I dont think that will happen much. But lets say that all of candidate Bs supporters vote honestly and  of As supporters decide to be strategic that could be enough to swing the vote to A. If that happens then candidate Bs supporters will realize that their honesty hurt their candidate and so next time they will bulletvote i.e. vote top score for their candidate and  for others. Now if some portion of voters do this and others are honest its still not as bad as our current system or as IRVs problems but its not ideal.Now lets look at a multicandidate race. If you bulletscore for only your favorite and thats not enough for them to win you just threw away your chance to have a say about the other candidates. So you should score other candidates. So the arguments about scorevoting and strategy are really this there could be some strategies that make sense and FairVote people just assert baselessly that the strategy that makes sense is bulletvoting which is nonsense. If you actually only like one candidate youd bulletvote but that would be honest. If you actually like others then would weigh the way that scoring a candidate higher gives them more advantage over lesser candidates but also gives them better shot of beating a more favored candidate. So honest scoring is a good strategy! It lets you simply hedge your bets.But heres the argument for Score Runoff which I find only partly convincing if I bulletvote to give maximum support to my favorite candidate e.g. candidate A while YOU are honest and vote highly for both candidate A and B but you prefer B then between A and B at least my vote counts more. In other words by bulletvoting I actually get more say in the results than you do. You may be okay with the results anyway or you wouldnt have scored the way you did which means this is a minor problem  but its still a problem for voters to get more sway by being dishonest.So the idea is that the runoff stage says regardless of score voter  likes AgtB and voter  likes BgtA so we count those preferences equally hence equal vote instead of giving extra weight to voter  for being strategic.So with Score Runoff once we get to the runoff stage  of voters who marked the two in the runoff differently all get equal weight to their votes. In other words a voter scoring A to B as  to  counts the same as one scoring  to  or  to  either way its a vote for A in the runoff.Think of it like Amazon product ratings. Most people might rate honestly but if your friend writes a book you might go around scoring all the other new books in the genre the lowest score just so that your friends book rises in the overall rankings. Even if its only  of raters doing this it could have an impact. But if it were a vote for book of the year then well the exact same strategy applies in terms of getting your friends book into the runoff but if your friends book gets into the runoff primarily because of these scummy strategic voting it will lose the runoff as long as the other book in the runoff had lots of supporters  even if they werent strategic and admitted liking your friends book.In short shitty strategies could still help get certain candidates into the runoff if they have enough strategic voters but then everyone will at least have an equal say about who wins the runoff. Whereas in plain score voting the strategic voters could get their candidates toward the top and then nothing happens to bring back in any weight for those who voted honestly.By the way Im writing so much to try to think this through myself as Im still making sense of it.So the point is that if strategic voting can flip a score vote your way well see a devolution to lots of strategic voting just to counter other strategic voting etc. at least thats the fear which Im unconvinced is actually likely at all but its possible. if strategic voting can only get your candidates into the runoff but not give you an outsized say between the two in the runoff then maybe its not worth it to vote strategically.I suppose if a set of procorporate voters voted both corporate parties top score and downvoted everyone else it would help get those two into the runoff. But I could vote one of the corporate parties a  and the other a  and still have just as much say in that runoff as someone who voted  to .Put yet another way if I hate the two corporate parties I might score them both  in plain score voting. You would not then know which of the two I prefer to the other. If the runoff is between the two corporate candidates anyway my vote can be ignored the same way nonvoters get ignored today. Hillary Clinton could say I dont need to pay any attention to these voters they will just vote me a  no matter what because they dislike corporate parties and if I work hard to get them to put me at a  instead it barely matters and isnt worth the effort. Whereas in Score Runoff she would say if I can just convince these people that Im better than Trump theyll mark me at least higher even if still low  and that really matters now if the runoff ends up with me and Trump so potentially that means more incentive for candidates to reach out to more voters even those who arent big supporters.Im not sure about this stuff and still prefer plain score because its simpler. But Score Runoff has some merit and is acceptable enough nothing horrible about it that Im happy to get behind an initiative because someone is leading one.My overall view is rankvoting is too pathological and too opaque and dense in calculating the results to be acceptable approval voting is probably the most practical for utter simplicity I like score voting best for many reasons scorerunoff does solve some minor problems with score but introduces some minor problems that are still nowhere near as bad as the problems with rankvoting  and because score runoff emphasizes ranking as an element it helps appeal to those who just intuitively prefer ranking over scoring although I dont think that preference has any objective merit.,EndFPTP,dcfor7w,2,t5_3fo0j

10552864,0,t1_dd46jtf,gtCan you give me an example of what that looks like?Say the range youre using is  to  and theres three candidates Alice Bob and Charlie.A ballot that doesnt use the full range could be something like   Alice  Bob  Charlie No one was given the maximum or minimum score. This means that the difference between candidates was not as large as it could have been. Voting Alice at  and Charlie at  would increase the chances of Alice winning and decrease the chances of Charlie winning which would be good from the perspective of this voter.gtSRV doesnt have favorite betrayal as I understand it. Youll have to provide an example?If youre honest about your favorite you could cause them to get into the runoff against a greater evil they cannot win against. If you betray them you might cause a compromise candidate to get into the runoff instead who can win against your greater evil.Example    | Alice | Bob | Charlie|||x  |       |      | x  |       |      | x  |       |      |    ampnbsp   TotalsCandidate | Total|||Alice | Bob | Charlie | ampnbsp   Alice and Charlie go to the runoff. Charlie is preferred  to .   Charlie wins.But if the Alice supporters betray their favorite | Alice | Bob | Charlie|||x  |       |      | x  |       |      | x  |       |      | ampnbsp   TotalsCandidate | Total|||Alice | Bob | Charlie | Bob and Charlie go to the runoff. Bob is preferred  to .   Bob wins.Better for these voters.gtI dont understand what laternoharm is can you provide me a link to something that describes it well?Wikipedia   ElectologyLaternoharm says that by being honest about your later choices you cannot harm the chances of your earlier choices. IRV passes this criterion. Score does not which is why supporting a compromise candidate does carry some risk. In SRV by supporting someone in addition to your favorite even if you do not support them as much you could cause them to go to the runoff instead of your true favorite even if you favorite could have won.IIRC Favorite Betrayal and LaterNoHarm and the Condorcet criterion are mutually incompatible. You cannot have more than one. But you can have none like SRV.gtIn approval isnt it true that if two candidates you like are by far most likely to win you may forego voting for your second favorite to try to boost the odds your first favorite wins?Yes. But bullet voting doesnt always make sense. If your true favorite doesnt have a very high chance of winning supporting only them is as foolish as it is now. If there was a third viable candidate who you strongly disliked supporting both of your liked candidates could still be a good idea.Whether SRV sufficiently helps increase honesty I dont know. You could give your nd choice  point more than the minimum so that just in case he does make it into the runoff your ballot still helps him against everyone other than your favorite. But its barley more honest and still carries slight risk. Doing the opposite could have issues as well. With Score you might have strategically given your top  the max score. But under SRV you might be enticed to lower your nd choice by one point to ensure that you have a voice in the runoff if it comes down to those two. But this is also barley more honest and still slightly risky.,EndFPTP,dd4aax0,4,t5_3fo0j
