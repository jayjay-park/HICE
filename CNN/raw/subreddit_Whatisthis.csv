4214439,0,t3_3956ih,Seconding what others have said here Your local school library or radio station will probably still have at least one reeltoreel deck to play your tape.Beware older tapes may shed oxide when played. That means that the actual iron oxide yep rust that is holding the data may flake off the plastic backing of the tape as you play it. You may only be able to play this one time before it disintegrates. Theres a special baking process used for very valuable tapes before they are played. My guess would be that this tape is not unique since VOA tapes were sent to hundreds of radio stations on a weekly basis but this may have been reused and could contain something interesting.

7950503,0,t1_d48myec,It is most commonly black although greenish to reddish and banded varieties also occur. Obsidian is formed from silicarichlavathat cools too quickly forcrystalsto grow. The result is a glass that does not possess the regular crystal structure ofmineralsin rhyolite and granite even though all three have the same general chemical composition.Magnetite produces black obsidian whereas more highly oxidized hematite produces reddish varieties.Black is the most common color of obsidian. However it can also be brown tan or green. Rarely obsidian can be blue red orange or yellow. The colors are thought to be caused mainly by trace elements or inclusions. rarely being the key word. As far as the link in my previous comment im sure the auction site sells both so as to make finding and searching for an object easier broaden the search terms and im sure that there are faux obsidian items out there.
