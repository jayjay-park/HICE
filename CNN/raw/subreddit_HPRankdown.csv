4811577,0,t1_cu0sw86,This? Pettigrew? ...Lets go with that.And this is Mrs. Cole. Sorry Dabu.gtMy only concern is whether maybe in the endgame strong characters like Snape or Draco or Riddle could lose just for being antagonists ...I think once we get that far Ill abandon the rubric in favor of deeper character analysis. This is more just to weed out lesser known periphery characters. And I definitely agree with you that minor characters dont always need theyre own story line or to be fleshed out to be wellwritten characters. At this point though a wellwritten minor character is going to be ranked lower than a wellwritten major character or any wellwritten character thats been fleshed out really. Since JK Rowling has the annoying habit of creating wellwritten characters I thought it was a good time to say goodbye to Piers.,HPRankdown,cu11f9m,2,t5_397qx

5167848,0,t3_3lsguz,Well but we did see in Deathly Hallows that some Muggleborns were on the run together like Dean and Tonks father. So I dont think its too far fetched to assume that he was on the run with some other Muggleborns who apparated with him to the Hogs Head. ,HPRankdown,cv8wznl,1,t5_397qx

6276667,0,t1_cz32gqv,Even though Im not meant I want to answer this question because Frank Bryce is another one of my very favorite minor characters and I am thrilled that both Ernie and Frank at least made it into the top . Frank Bryce isnt just a random character who gets killed. He is the first noneevil character in the series who gets killed.James and Lily died just before the story started and we never met them when they were alive. This is huge and a big surprise after three books where everybody makes it out alive. Just like Cedric Diggory hes there to show that times are changing.And he isnt completely random either. JKR gave us his history and we even witnessed the events from his point of view. He was wounded in the war and had a bad leg because of this. He had to search for work and found it as the Riddles gardener. He suffered a trauma from war and became distant from other people because of this. He was suspected of murder even though he was innocent. And even after he was released because nobody could proof his guilt the whole village still suspected him. And decades later he wasnt close to the younger villagers either because he thought that they suspected him of murder as well and they thought that he was just a grumpy and odd old man.Still he did his duty and cared for the garden. When he thought there were burglars in the Riddle House he went to confront them. And even though he had just witnessed Voldemort talking to a giant snake he had the guts to talk back to him. He told Lord Voldemort himself that he didnt like his manners!!! And then this man was killed and nobody probably even really missed him. At least every other dead character in this series who wasnt evil got mourned or honoured as a hero. No such luck for Frank Bryce one of Voldemorts most memorable victims.This is what makes him a great character for me. JKR suceeded in convincing me that this man and his death mattered even though I never met him before this chapter.,HPRankdown,cz3344c,4,t5_397qx
6280059,0,t1_cyxjix4,Im okay with seeing her go here but I also like her. I think shes effective for her sort of fillerish part. Not enough to warrant a higher ranking but I dont think shes out of place ranking as high as she did either.,HPRankdown,cz3h0mi,1,t5_397qx

6350954,0,t1_czbdhmm,hm maybe. but thats not what the wiki says. it says horcruxes can be anything but Voldemort first sought to make them items significant in the magical world and when he failed to obtain all of them picked objects of personal significance. ,HPRankdown,czbj766,5,t5_397qx

6537488,0,t3_4564rp,Sad Wilbur is sad Regulus for how little relevance he holds in the overall storyline is a pretty important to the development of the Black family values as well as being one of the shining examples of a good Slytherin Character.He grows up in the same household as Sirius and gets revered as the good child but Sirius doesnt necessarily hate him for it he just hates his ideaology. But Sirius and Regulus are more alike than it seems on the surface. Sirius developed the courage to stand fully against Voldemorts ideology at about  and it just takes Regulus a bit longer. With that Regulus is one of the few Death Eaters to defect for non fearrelated reasons. Once he realises how Kreacher was treated he takes it upon himself entirely to help bring down Voldemort sacrificing his own blood sanity and eventual life despite the fact that theres a houseelf next to him that would be willing to do that for his master which would allow Regulus to escape alive. He makes the sacrifice that no other Death Eater makes and his bravery and badassery in that act carries a legacy that lasts postmortem where his servant leads a fight against Voldemort in Regulus name.This feels too low for Regulus. I can see at least  characters that Id have below him maybe .,HPRankdown,czvj227,3,t5_397qx

6887110,0,t3_4a2s4s,You stole my next cut! Very well done on this writeup.EDIT will use this comment as a receptacle for further thoughts on Dobby. Definitely have more and I dont want to spam this cut.EDIT  A few thoughts on Dobby.To me Dobby occupies a similar role as Luna Lovegood in the story they both play the part of the oddity who hovers in Harrys general orbit and provide ingredients that he was otherwise unable to achieve in order to reach his goal. Dobbys ingredients are much more tangible Gillyweed information badass apparition powers while Lunas are less so grief management breaking down of barriers. In the role as Harrys Oddity I do think that Dobby is more successful in the quirkiness realm despite not being a human he never feels disconnected and offputting and while his quirks are over the top as hell they come from a place of love. However with Dobby the quirks are almost the entirety of who he is. When Dobby is in a situation that causes him great personal distress ratting on the Malfoys he responds in his quirky manner by bashing his head against a lamp. When Dobby is pushed to his most fearful when Umbridge corners the DA he shivers and shakes and generally reacts as you would expect a giant ham. Even when hes pushed he reacts within his paradigm of oddball. The reason he gets away with this and the reason Ive let him survive to this point is hes just so goshdarn lovable that you cant help but feel strongly about him. Hes a bit reminiscent of Pikachu in that way and not just because both constantly repeat their own name. Hes one note hes hammy hes bizarre but hes also got clearly defined emotions and his actions while hyper convenient are actions that endear us to him even more. This results in a stellar emotional death scene which serves almost to remind us how much hed endeared himself to us. Dobby is a character impossible to feel neutral on and thats his greatest strength.,HPRankdown,d0wyyqs,5,t5_397qx
