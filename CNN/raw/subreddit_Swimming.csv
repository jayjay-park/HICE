178645,0,t3_1w55mt,In my experience training with a team makes one more committed to training consistently. If you have the drive to practice everyday on your own and to not be distracted then go for it. I also find that coaches can help with strokes if you have a good coach and also if you specifically ask for their advice. If not then they are more focused on making sure everyone completes their set. I do like the team aspect because you make great friendships while having a good workout. If you have had lots of practice and you know what you need to do to get better and what you need to fix then I recommend swimming on your own. If not then try out a team to see if you like it. You can always revert back to swimming on your own. ,Swimming,ceys6ec,11,t5_2r0po

Your thighs are dropping to your chest very quickly but your feet are taking a long time to rotate around to the wall. This is making your movements slow and allowing your body time to drop in the water. Thats I think part of why your body is so much lower than your feet on the wall and is causing you to push off at an angle from the wall.To work on that I would see about pulling your feet around tighter in  towards your body making a tighter ball will get you around faster and hopefully keep you from pushing off in a downward manner.,Swimming,cf8rtyc,3,t5_2r0po

412605,0,t1_cfnisqw,Write down everything that you eat and add up the calories and the macros.   Then find your base noexercise energy expenditure. That is how many calories your body with its height and weight needs in order to just go about your day with no workouts.    From that number subtract  calories. eg youre a day maintenance person again no exercise so now youll be eating  calday.  Thats the number youre going to aim for.   Eat that many calories every day and without any exercise you should be losing about lb per week.  To add exercise in it you recalculate your day. So if you go to the pool and you burn  calories in a workout now your total need that day is  instead of the  just to go about your day. So if we subtract  from that number you want to eat  that day.  The easier way to do that is to assume your baseneed   eg.  and then add your burned calories onto it so    for the day.  Some people find this illogical so let me know if you do and I will explain in greater detail but Ill leave it at that for now.  The best thing that you can do is take in fewer calories than you burn and get the best food you can get out of it within those calories. I will not suggest any particular diet plan as most of them are bunk and the remaining ones vary by person. If you like paleo and it works for you have at it.  But by and large if you eat  calories fewer than you burn every day you will lose about lb per week.  The only general eating advice I have to give is that if your greatgrandmother wouldnt recognise it as food its often a lesser choice. Eating things you could hunt or grow is generally a good idea.     And if you exercise well while you are doing it then you will look better at that lower weight when you get there and it will often help your motivation. For me when I am using my body to do good things I am less motivated to put crap in it.   If you want some help with it there are many good websites and apps out there where you can enter what you eat and how you exercise and calculate the calories for you. MyFitnessPal is a popular one that has a simple and logical calculator that a lot of people dont understand so if my explanation above gives you any questions ask away.  ,Swimming,cfnj6dw,6,t5_2r0po

Even if the straight arm catch is not for you a deeper downward pull will help create a more efficient and powerful stroke. you cant force the chest down. Its more about core strength and head position. Ive learned head position controls body position. If youre head moves your body will naturally adjust itself to level out. In this case you might want to tuck your head a bit more. If that isnt for you try and bring the hips to the surface of the water. This can be supplemented by doing kicking sets. When kicking with a kickboard note if your hips are under water if they are attempt to drive the hips up a bit more and hold that body position.

670506,0,t1_cgfh5ua,People other emphasize the importance of the kick because because for most swimmers a body driven butterfly is the fastest and most efficient option. Like breaststroke and freestyle there are some clear differences between how the stroke is swum by different athletes.Shoulder driven fly is great for those with wide strong shoulders. But for most age group swimmers the majority of girls and shorter boys or those with less muscle development it makes more sense to use your entire body and emphasize kicking from your core rather than spin your arms.

697883,0,t1_cgjlffm,okay  Id recommend starting off with building up basic freestyle technique. Watch some videos to help  focus on maintaining stroke efficiency which will come with improving technique poor technique will make you tired very quickly. If there is one piece of advice I can give to relative beginners its to NOT neglect kick  especially when you initially start kicking drills they will be a complete and utter pain but power through it to build up kicking strength and endurance. Build up arm strength and endurance  use a pull buoy focus on stretching and reaching forward on each strokeFrom there on its a case of building up muscle endurance and fitness through different types of sets which you can get from the links on the right EDIT sorry this may all seem a bit rushed and confusing but I believe that the plethora of swimming videos on youtube will explain any kind of technique and drills better than I canjoining a club will also mean you are putting in the hours required  however Ive found that joining a club means that there is often less emphasis on you as an individual and they often focus less on building up technique and more on competition fitness so you may need to go swimming on your own as well.

720182,0,t3_22evvv,Your m fly isnt that bad especially if youve had time off. You know the strokes and possilby have done some sports in the meantime but other than that youre essentially starting again after such a long pause. Your coach will take care of the planning of your physical training so cant help with that. Of course if you have a kick set of the stroke of your choice youll pick butterfly or dolphins and without a kickboard if allowed by the coach. On fly kicks on every or every second kick raise your shoulders above the surface. This practices the body movement for easy breathing and easy recovery of arms  you can swim perfectly fine butterfly with just kicks but the pull speeds you up. After breathing in dive in forehead first but immediately cut the dive to remain on the surface. If you really want homework for physical conditioning ask your coach. Core exercises may help.Now one important thing to realize with the young ladies m butterfly is that it isnt a shortdistance event. It would be of interest to hear your m split or even better short course splits on the m. You will need to pace your swim for a mediumdistance event. Pay great deal of attention on body control The old saying about flyers not getting their backs wet except on starts and turns is more or less valid here. This will require keeping your head down even when breathing breathing almost below the body is possible and concentrating on keeping your back high at all times except when starting the downsweep kick with your body.If you have a dying on the last  meters event in your swim itll probably help to have a very very short streamlining period after your arm recovery  just remember unlike breast you are not allowed to dive in fly so some body part must break the surface at all times.,Swimming,cgm4z6z,4,t5_2r0po

1268293,0,t3_28mbvu,I like watching relays. Theres a feeling you get from watching them. The feeling of conpetition. The feeling of being in a relay. You recall racing relays and how fun it is to see your team mate duke it out with your rivals in the next lane. You get to cheer as loud as you want and know they cant hear you but yell anyways. You feel like you mean somthing that you have a commitment when you jump in. You know you have  others and a whole team cheering for you.

1785629,0,t1_ck46ksf,I have no idea if your a guy or how old you are but Ill give you my perspective as a  y.o. guy who has been coaching for almost  years.I started when I was  assistant coaching a team   that I swam for.  Im not the head coach of that team and Ill try to cover some things you may not have thought of and that I havent seen other people mention.  I cant tell you how much I love my job its amazing but Im going to hit some negative points.The most important thing to be aware of especially if youre younger and super especially if youre a guy is that you are working with minors in a very hands on setting.  Make sure whatever you do there is always someone else around when you are with any of your kids.  If youre a guy NEVER be alone with a female swimmer at that age the kids will notice that and they like to gossip.  When I started coaching I was with kids my own age and that was fine but now that Im older I have to be much more aware of who Im with.Make sure you know where your position stands regarding talking to parents.  When I first started as an assistant coach I was pretty much told to avoid talking to parents as much as possible.  This keeps you out of the politics which will severely impact your mood and willingness to work with kids.Be aware that the kids are teens right now.  A lot of the times they dont think about what they are saying and cant control some of their feelings.  Make sure you provide a good way for the kids to give you feed back.  My swimmers know if they dont like a set they can come up to me AFTER  practice and just say hey coach I didnt like this.  Not all of your sets are going to be perfect and they need a way to criticize you without trying to start a mutiny.You said its a part time job please please PLEASE remember that.  Do not get attached to your kids.  It will be a lot easier for you since they are all older but I considered moving to a new area last year and one of the things that stopped me was the fact that I had literally watched these kids grow up and I wanted to keep coaching them.  I dont regret staying but you dont want to be the person who never stops coaching.Set goals for your swimmers set short term goals set long term goals set a goal for Tuesday at practice set a goal for that meet in  months set a goal for  years when theyre in college.  For every hard goal make sure there are a few that are easily obtainable. Give them something to work for beyond winning.  Ive seen to many kids burn out of the sport because they hit a wall and cant get past it.  Make sure your swimmers know you support them and make sure they realize that theyre going to have bad meets.Some personal tips for you.  Keep a note book of sets.  I usually improvise my practices but once in a while I have something else on my mind and having a premade practice is a life saver.  Dont let your car get clogged up with swim stuff there is nothing worse then getting ready to go out with friends and realizing your back seat is filled with towels and suits.  Get a good stop watch and not your phone!  You want something that can take multiple splits.  If you have a phone that supports it get a life proof.  Its nice to know your phone is safe and Ive used it to film underwater multiple times.  Have cheap flip flops youll lose them.If you have any questions feel free to ask.,Swimming,ck48cm6,8,t5_2r0po

There are conferences where youd have to be swimming Olympic trials times to be one of the top swimmers. Decide what youre looking for and see if the school youre planning on going to has it. I personally like the thought of swimming for a team where Im not the fastest but Im fast enough to make the relays.

One of the problems with swimmers is that we get used to burning K Kcalories a day so when we stop we can over eat you being a wrestler shouldnt have a problem with that.Dont worry about knowing all the strokes I still suck at the breaststroke and have been DQd everytime I do it in competition.  If you have any kind of decent coach they are going to be spending a lot of time with you and other beginners working on how to do the different strokes and other swimming mechanics.

Ive won both club state and zones since I was in th grade gone to HS state freshman and sophomore year placing top  in every event and Ive also gone to JNats for club these past two years. This year will be my th year of competitive swimming. I agree with uCuberoot on training your endurance. A popular training method going around is URSPT or ultra short race pace training. This method contains sets such as xs on the  swimming at race pace. The goal is to hold each  at the same stroke count per length and time. Michael Andrew another top level swimmer trains with this method. The problem with this is that no aerobic capacity is created from this since endurance isnt focused on and thus hinders anything but sprints. Though you are focusing on sprinting aerobic capacity is very important as it is the base that everything is built upon and therefore allows for improvement. Ive talked to many coaches about training techniques and this is one of their least favorite because the swimmers that do it have nothing to build off of and therefore cant improve muchA few tips for when youre practicing Watch the clock and know your times  This is very very important. If you know your times during your sets you can compare yourself during each repeat. Also it keeps you engaged and therefore focused on the task at hand. Just going through the motions isnt enough as youll end up getting lazy and tired and more than likely start to form bad habits Always finish strong  Those last  yardsmeters are one of the most important part of your race along with your start and turn! This is even more crucial in the short sprint distances since there is next to margin for error. Always finish strong both in practice and at competitions! But especially in practice since itll turn into a habit thenHope this helps best of luck with your goals!Edit USRPT can be a practice that you do but dont focus solely on it,Swimming,csgpqvq,0,t5_2r0po

If you want to swim middistance   m of freestyle for long sets   m at  of your max speed then its worth learning to breathe every rd stroke.  Youll just feel more even in your muscular development and will be less likely to get a crick in your neck.  If you want to swim sprintfast for   m repeated intervals then it doesnt really matter if you alternate more that you take fewer breathes as even a breathe with good technique can be slower than no breathe.

The goal is a small clean entry hole breaking the surface with your hands and the rest of your body following through that small area. If you go straight out the length of body will drop flatly onto the water and you will belly flop.  As for goggles get your head down.

Swimming is like running in water...at first you look like an idiot then slowly but surely you begin to refine the little things that can make big improvements. Taking a video of your stroke is a great first step to really analyze what you need to improve  its not about how you look today its about what you need to change to get you to where you want to be tomorrow.  So watch your video see what small things you can do now and change them.Make a new video in  weeks after you have fully integrated your small changes and compare. Next change a few more small things and repeat. In no time at all you will be very surprised at your improvements.Good luck.,Swimming,cy90k1i,1,t5_2r0po

6112554,0,t3_3z8mrr,After going through college doing half the season drinking and half the season dry I would say stay away from alcohol for a good while before a big meet if thats what youre getting at here. Alcohol has a lot of detrimental effects on your body. Firstly its a diuretic so after consuming alcohol you need to do a lot of work to get yourself hydrated and your electrolytes back in balance. Also it effects how your liver produces energy. Obviously with swimming you need lots of energy and if your liver is still recovering from processing all that alcohol it wont be as efficient when producing energy for your muscles to use the next day. Thats all I can remember off the top of my head. It also should be stated that you may think ok as lond as I dont drink about a week out I should be good. Not really if you use alcohol consistently through your season your practices wont be as good and you wont get the most out of them therefore you wont have progressed as much at the end of the season. Its a compounding effect.   ,Swimming,cykfnj8,3,t5_2r0po

It can be focused on technique too but to keep someone that young actually engaged there has to be something fun about it. I would see if you can try it out before fully committing to it. My club lets you try out the first week free then you decide if you want to stay. The other thing to consider would be safety. I like to make sure all the kids I have for just the summer can swim about . yards of freestyle and backstroke comfortably by the end of the summer. Its far enough that they can jump off diving boards and swim to the ladder without help and at our pool its far enough to go down the slide.

Youre going to want to incorporate your hips into this kick not just your legs if you decide to go this route which I highly recommend. Also make sure you are keeping a tight streamline whether you are flutter kicking or dolphin kicking. Lastly as for breathing before the swim you should do some deep breathing. Inhale as much air as you can and then exhale as much air as you can. Slowly! Do this  times. While doing the swim hold your breath until it starts to burn. Then slowly exhale a small amount of air out of your nose. This should relieve to burn for a little while.

Recommendations I would make are to maybe hit some weights. Strength training is very useful to sprints in particular and it might be that you just dont have the muscle mass to drop below a minute. Other then that I would recommend training some short sprints . or  metre repetitions. I would also look at lowering your number of breaths but that isnt essential.

See the trick is fat floats and it will Make it easier to find your place. So we need to use your surface area to our advantage. Try spreading your arms and legs apart so you look like a starfish what we tell the kids and pushing your head back so you could balance a water bottle on your forehead. Plenty of people want to pick up their heads so their ears are not underwater fight that urge you need your spine in alignment when learning. Finally push your hips up so you can feel a small bump in your lower spine and try to keep you breathing slow and pushed into your lungs. Some say belly button or hips on top of the water if that works for you perfect!Dont expect to just be able to float you have to practice a bit I work in groups of  sec intervals sometimes balancing peoples heads on my shoulder while they find there center.

9111780,0,t3_5530l3,I have a similar issue and what Ive concluded is that sprint free and slowdistance free are essentially two different strokes. Sprinting requires a very quick turnover with constant arm motion while when doing distance there is a glide phase of your stroke. If you have this glide phase in your stroke when you practice and you want to get better at sprinting I would say switch up your stroke in practice so your arms are constantly moving in a circle. If this is already how your stroke is in practice and you just notice that your form is a little worse when you race I would just say to really make sure youre doing everything perfect every time when you practice and then when you have to sprint itll just be muscle memory.

Do all of your physical therapy exercises in the pool at least three times a week.Ive been dealing with similar issues for years now and being in the water has kept me healthy. Changing from doing laps to doing permanent physical therapy is a hard transition to make but if the possibility of further injury and pain is lurking its the best solution.You can always try strokes in the walking poolslowly and deliberatelyto see what happens. Several folks at our pool use snorkels to swim laps because they dont have to twist their necks and backs to breathe.I would also like to make the observation that this is not an agerelated injury but older people tend to be more conservative about coming back from surgeries younger people who think this is a onetime event tend to go back for more surgeries. And my cynical take on doctors is that most of them have never been in the pool for any extended periods of time and they dont understand the basic therapeutic value of the experience. Some do understand that it helps with circulation of the internal organs but most do not understand the exhilaration and subsequent relaxation of lap swimmingtheir loss.I hope you find a routine that works for you.,Swimming,d8kedwd,1,t5_2r0po

I dont want to rehash whats been posted by other users but here are some things I want to addFormsuper important in everything if you notice weird pains identify problems in form that may be causing them. This is for both activities. Consistency mainly for lifting deload a bit and do mostly the same exercises from week to week and every week push it a small amount in some way more reps or higher weight. Thats how you get your CNS used to doing both. If you skip things because youre a little tired chances are youre going to feel up to doing a lot at a later time but your body wont be used to it and youll just be a sore stiff mess. Dont max every set every day. Aim for long time consistent progression. Mobility get stretching and make sure youre not doing dangerous things especially to your knees. When your mobility increases first work it in the pool then work it in the gym a ways back. If youre not especially mobile right now its possible to increase your flexibility faster than your muscles can keep up with so build strength through the range of motion carefully. Foam rolling every day can help you recover a lot better. Look up a tutorial online its going to have you so much looser at the end of the week.

If Water repellency is more of a concern for you and I know it is for me you may want to go with the Lzr X it has compression very comparable to Arena Carbon Flex with MUCH better water repellency. I have not tried any TYR or MP suits but Ive really loved my Lzr X however I swim IM and breast so as a flyer you my have a different preference. I would advise you go to a local swim shop and talk to the people that work there and try on some suits to find the best for you. You may find you like high waisted over normal.

Looking for private lessons didnt yield me any results locally so Ive been learning through YouTube and going to the public pool early in the morning.  My problem is putting my head underwater I immediatly panic and hold my breath.  Spent a lot of time practising breathing at home in a sink to get comfortable.  Took a few weeks for me but I could eventually make  laps before I need a rest.  Its all in the rhythm I found I can almost pinpoint exactly when I lose control of my form and then its all I can do to make it to the wall.  Also Im not all the efficient yet either. I really want to do a triathlon one day so I gotta get through this.  Its a real  humbling experience though.  To answer your question takes a few hours to learn the forms but facing your fears will make it even longer and more difficult.  I think a lot of pools have little blue floating boards you can useno idea what they are called and you can just work on kicking for a while until you get more comfortable in the water.  Baby steps!

10466089,0,t1_dbqm73s,Sophomore year in high school I was the worst kicker on the team. I made it a goal to be the best by the next season. Began doing dryland leg workouts twice a week. One day focusing on low weight high rep ranges pyramiding down  reps on each exercise squats leg press leg extensions leg curls calf raises. The other day I would pyramid down  with the same exercises but with higher weight. By the time the following season began I was THE best kicker on the team and I attributed that to this leg regime. Also if you practice on your own try using fins as they force correct form on kicking sets. Or if you want to challenge yourself wear old tennis shoes during a kick set.

10799076,0,t3_5ufiwb,Bucket turns and suicide turns are both slow and outdated. The Shanteau turn is what almost all pros use. For example see the IM at Rio specifically at  play it in slow motion to see the turns Theres a tutorial on it here from Shanteau himself. The difference is instead of dragging your butt through the water and shoving water around rotating your upper body its allowing you to touch with your upper hand and basically do a flip turn. It takes a LOT more practice to do it well and not DQ but its miles faster. My college team ran a trial and averaged around . faster with these than any other regardless of personal preference. A lot of coaches who are lowlevel or club without nationals experience havent picked up on it yet because its fairly recent. It started to gain momentum right around  at the London games if I remember correctly. Edit just for clarity The trick to doing this legally is to stay on your back rules say less than  degrees until you actually touch then rotate flip push. Id be happy to answer any questions about this  its really REALLY beneficial to learn. ,Swimming,ddtuisi,13,t5_2r0po

Id also ask your doctor about what sort of weight lifting you could do that might help stablize your shoulder. Stronger all around muscles will help you have less injury. You might want to ask him for good weight lifting for overall body too if he has any suggestions. May help prevent injury to another area but like anything proper form is the most important thing,Swimming,ddwlwz1,3,t5_2r0po

11552549,0,t1_dg5crv9,Hahah thats good. Fish are really good in the water!The snorkel could be worth a try. My big problem with it is that it wont be nearly as effective for building your cardio as regular swimming would. But depending on your age and fitness there is no shame in getting a snorkel for your swimming. But I would say dont bother spending the money for at least  more tries in the pool. No point spending unnecessary money.And there are two things I would try. If they dont work go for the snorkel.First is a set of flippers. They will most likely be at whatever pool you are swimming in and they will take a LOT of the work away from whatever you are doing. Since you will be working a bit less you will be able to build a bit more cardio up while youre doing it and when youve gotten strong enough you can ditch the flippers and go without them.Second and this one is the most important work on your breathing. I would bet that you are holding your breath while you are swimming instead of blowing out your bubbles or exhaling during your stroke. Try taking a breath and then doing  arm strokes WHILE exhaling the entire time then take your next breath. See if your lungs are full of air from your previous breath you will probably have a hard time taking another breath because you have such a short time to exhale AND inhale.Let me know how that works ,Swimming,dg5hgvl,2,t5_2r0po

11712476,0,t3_672tb6,Dont listen to the tempo guy that only works for some breaststrokers and honestly as you develop youll find your own tempo. Heres some advice though keep your head still your body follows your head and you shouldnt bob ur head up and down thats could be why you get so high and dont go forward enough stay lower and stay smaller. Breaststroke is a power stroke but its more about eliminating drag. Staying lower and staying narrower will help with that. An underwater recovery can help with this. stronger wrists keep your hand your wrists connected they should Be like on long continuation of your forearm this will help you catch water. keep your kick narrower and try to keep your knees still for one bringing your knees up increases your drag by a lot and will bring u to an almost complete stop. You should really think about keeping those knees fixed together and thing of a sweeping motion with you ankles. This will eliminate drag in two directions. Also the propulsion you get from bring your legs super wide is minimal and less drag will be more beneficial. you sweep your hands out way to high. This puts all your energy into going up instead of foreword and we want to be going forward. This also increases drag which is not what were going for. To fix this keep your pull narrower and really try and focusing on catching and pulling the water back with your forearm and hand this is where strong wrists come into play .Source I was in your position with basically the same times as you my freshman year if not probably a little slower. I worked on all of these and  I am still working on three of them if Im being honest here I went from where you are to a .  breaststroker and .  breaststroker Im for a  breaststroker so thats why I said tempo isnt everything. Also probably work on ur pull outs but I havent seen them so idk.,Swimming,dgnn012,1,t5_2r0po

11802024,0,t3_68difd,So I answered your tech suit question in another thread but I guess Im here for  fly tips.So first off nobody here can help you. Why? Because were not there to see what youre doing incorrectly. Say I tell you to have good underwaters but what if you have the best underwaters in the world? Obviously that stuff wont help you. I would ask your coach.Anyways here are some very general tips. Cant really get into specifics because of reasons listed aboveUnderwaters for any  are important. My friend who is currently at Stanford under scholarship would kick underwater to about the halfway point and then start his butterfly his time is like a  for a  fly. However this is assuming your kicks are excellent. If you know your kicks suck and you dont have time to improve upon it then at least go past the flags with your underwaters.Move your hips. Your butt should come a bit out of the water and your second kick should be almost effortless. Obviously put some power into that second kick when racing but my point is that your hips should move that much not too little not too much.Your turns are where you could lose a second or two. My club coach wanted me to just touch and go. Never wanted us to grab on to the wall because some top tier swimming facilities dont have grabbable walls. If you dont feel comfortable doing the touch and go just grab the wall. However make sure your turns are fast. I cant really go into specifics because otherwise this part would take me all day.Lastly are your arms. I always tell people to have their palms face the opposite way from the way theyre swimming. Thats always a starting point towards improvement.Lastly its a  so dont breathe too often. Try at most two breaths for both laps. Joseph Schooling took  breath on his  split at NCAAs.Id recommend watching videos. They might help you a lot. ,Swimming,dgxstly,2,t5_2r0po
