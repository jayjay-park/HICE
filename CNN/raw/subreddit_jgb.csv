11086480,0,t1_deoku9i,My setlist for tonight is buried in the pile of gear and luggage... so maybe well play your requests?  Not sure.We post soundboards on the Archive sometimes along with fanposted AUDs from time to time.  That job tends to fall to me and Ive been slacking.  We do have a really nice  camera video from Saturdays Sweetwater show with SBD audio only bummer is the keys are low in the mix which is a real shame since we just hired the keyboardist from Donnas band and hes a real monster player.  And really nice guy!. Edit I tried to PM you this link if its even the correct link. but I cant figure out how on mobile.  If this breaks any rules Ill delete it  Sweetwater Video ,jgb,deon5at,2,t5_2z4u1
