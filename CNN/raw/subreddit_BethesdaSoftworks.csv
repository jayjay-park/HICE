7923794,0,t3_4gy9jw,Clearly you dont understand the beauty of Bethesdas games treat the bugs like features and you will realise why no one here minds them even though their bugs and arent supposed to be there they add to the fun of the game we already have enough super serious game producers we need a AAA title that takes it easy once in a while,BethesdaSoftworks,d46pjxl,1,t5_2tfbo
7927256,0,t3_4nts98,I was checking the schedule for today and there is a slot for a new Bethesda game.Be weird if they chose not to announce it at their own press conference but maybe theyre trying to steal the day?.....

8523177,0,t1_d65b2tj,gt it used Valves new bundle system which lowers the price if you already own a game.Im really liking this new Steam feature I just picked up the DLC I didnt have Hearthstone and Dragonborn through the bundle for cheaper than buying Dragonborn alone even with its sale price taken into account.Now Im all set to upgrade to the Special Edition in October.,BethesdaSoftworks,d66yj4w,1,t5_2tfbo

10325555,0,t1_dcdvfpc,No it did not.  My friend who does IT for a bank is helping me sent some capture data from Wireshark over to him and he said something was off when my DNS said it came back as  and another site came back .  So he thinks right now my router might be to blame because it couldnt even do aa trace to mods.bethesda.net.  Weird thing is DNS is set correctly.  So hes a bit stumped.,BethesdaSoftworks,dcegj70,1,t5_2tfbo
10494631,0,t1_dcxmri6,I saw that post and no I kinda figured that was more of a place for sharing mods rather than technical help with Papyrus but Ill give it a go and ask anyway. Thanks. ,BethesdaSoftworks,dcxoday,1,t5_2tfbo
