9967506,0,t3_5i503s,It is in fact a lifestyle magazine.  Were looking for people starting new businesses and doing different things in the community.  If you know of someone or something you think is interesting chances are someone else might believe its interesting too.  The other magazines you mentioned have a poor online presence and since we now live in a digital world were offering a better online experience to serve those that dont want to subscribe to an outdated magazine which they only receive  times a year.  Our content is free available all the time and we can feature any type of digital media.  ,SpringfieldIL,db6sj6v,2,t5_2rdxx

Lid on  gallon container of sauce in the walkin cooler had mold accumulation Noodles in dry storage walkin cooler were observed with mouse dropping inside.They actually needed a health inspector to inform  them that they cant have mouse turds or mold in the food.The inspector even observed multiple handwashing violations and that was with employees knowing they were being observed.,SpringfieldIL,ddb4ku5,4,t5_2rdxx
