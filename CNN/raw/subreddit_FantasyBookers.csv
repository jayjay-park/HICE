The morality rating is the inverse of your potential risk level on a  scale.For example if you set your risk level to  percent you will not be able to obtain or maintain a sponsor with a morality rating higher than . The same holds true for a risk level of  percent and a morality rating of .It seems as though you wanted to have a really risky show dont we all? and your sponsors ditched you because the shows content exceeded the risk they were morally willing to take.,FantasyBookers,cf8zg1o,5,t5_2wgtc
1144674,0,t3_20i3dz,Ive just started a new game based on a real world mod.I wiped out all in game contracts and then ended TNA and WWE companies. I got a bunch of friends who are wrestling fans to create companies and titles for them and then we did a draft of ten wrestlers with a couple of bonus ones thrown in at the end based on provided draft lists. Then I made in game characters for them and set them as owning their feds in game. Last night I started the game world off and started hiring other wrestlers and setting up TV and PPV. So nothing is happening at the moment. Cheers,FantasyBookers,chydyx6,1,t5_2wgtc

Just make a tournament title set for a particular month you want a MITB payperviewmatch to be in. That way unlike making it a title which you have to defend in order to keep prestige up the titles prestige is only based on the one match a year for it.,FantasyBookers,cir7dw8,2,t5_2wgtc

I will however choose some matches like if someone has been champ too long and its time to either go up to the next big title or change of scenery. For example I had Neville as US champ from June  and he just lost it in February of  in a triple threat match Chuck Taylor won the title over Sami Zayn. Now Neville is moving up challenging at WM  against Neville who knows who will win. Might have KO cash in the MITB though.,FantasyBookers,czkstfs,2,t5_2wgtc

Then click Contracts on the left hand side. There you can choose to add anyone you want to the company.If the workers you add already have another contract somewhere else you will need to cancel that contract so they can work for you. To cancel those contracts go to the Workers tab while editing the database. Select your worker and there is a contract button like there was for the companies.
