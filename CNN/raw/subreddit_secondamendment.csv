4011746,0,t3_36eocn,Ive seen this already and its worth paying attention to.  What may not be so obvious here is that because black people know that carrying a firearm is likely to get them shot they dont carry firearms.  Because they dont carry firearms they dont own firearms.  Because they dont own firearms they arent championing for firearms rights. Its this sort of disenfranchisement that antigunners would like to get us all towards so its even more important that  not only are we championing equal rights for all but  that we actually pay attention to arguments that dont directly affect us so that we can understand them. Obviously just as with all people nobodys alike just because of their skin color but there are millions of folks out there whod be happy to vote for Obama again even knowing what hes tried to do to firearms owners because they simply dont care.  And it isnt that they dont care because they dont want to care but because they simply havent got the luxury of caring because they arent treated equally enough for them to even entertain the idea of carrying a firearm without getting killed. ,secondamendment,crdkj2e,3,t5_2sfew

Anybody can make a poll sound like it defends their purpose.But the vast majority of the population supports gun ownership and support the right to own and carry a gun. And THAT is why the NRA always has majority support and why politicians not listening to the desires of the people is the problem.,secondamendment,cw7o4ok,5,t5_2sfew

8031291,0,t3_4p6jeb,They are trying to obfuscate the issue.Technically speaking you bought the gun online without a background check from the seller. Now you and I know that you still have to do one at the FFL receiving the transfer but nongunpeople dont. So if they dupe enough people into believing that theres just no background check then those voters on the fence who think thats a bad thing will side with them.The other thing theyre kinda conflating here is the websites that facilitate private transactions. Here in Texas for example we have Texas Gun Trader. Its just a classifieds web page where you can see what people are selling or want to sell yourself. Find something in your town you want meet the seller buy your gun and get on with your day.In this case youre not legally required to perform or submit to a background check. But you found the gun and contacted the seller online. Even though you didnt actually buy the gun online.If the antis muddy this issue enough and get enough people to agree that whatever they suggest is a good idea then they can justify universal background checks to those voters. That way they stop some sort of gun sale that was only incidentally related to the internet that didnt require a background check.This is exactly the same kind of tactic theyve been pushing with the socalled gunshow loophole for a while now.,secondamendment,d4isjv7,3,t5_2sfew
