344273,0,t3_1y0yvr,Humorously given how you got into this mess I would strongly advise you smoke the brisket separate from everything else.  What you could do is smoke the brisket first pull it off just when it starts to stall out around  wrap it in foil and then finish it in an inside oven.  You could then move to a higher temp in the smoker and tackle the rest of the lot as you described keeping in mind meats on lower racks are going to pick up some juices from the meats on higher racks.,smoking,cfggbjq,2,t5_2qkku

849530,0,t3_23tkd1,Store it in a dry location with vents amp door open.  Its not relevant at first but the build up of oils amp smoke will otherwise eventually give way to mold which is hard to clean.Foil the underside of your water pan for easy cleaning.  Those longer foil rolls are handy.Since youre a welder make yourself a charcoal chimney or give in and buy one.Try out alternate methods of starting the charcoal applicable to whatever youre smoking.  Follow the standard recipes at virtualweberbullet.com at first.  Theyre like training wheels specifically for the WSM.  Eventually you can just skim them and eventually just do whatever the hell you want.I second the wireless thermometer advice.  Just know that the smoker temp will fluctuate and probably run hot for your first smokes until the smoker gets a little seasoned and all the little air gaps seal up.  More oxygen means more heat!  It will get easier.Meats chewy?  It seems contradictory but chances are its undercooked.  Its practically impossible to overcook any fatty and highcollagen meats.  If youre running out of time and your fuel is dying dont be afraid to foil your meat and toss it in the oven.  Youve got all the flavor you need from the smoker you just need to get past the plateau and into the tender zone.edit Thought of one more.  Basting is mostly hogwash or for show.  All it does it give the fire huge gulps of oxygen and cause heat spikes.  Any basting recipe can easily be replaced with an injection for more effective flavoring and better heat control.,smoking,ch0ugfl,3,t5_2qkku

You may get lucky one out of four times and have it turn out good. Usually dry and just meh.I do mine at  pecan or hickory salt and pepper only and sometimes granulated garlic and smoke until internal is . Then I foil and alternately wrap in clean old towels and put in a warm cooler for up to  hours when I need to hold it that long. You can also hold in a  degree oven foiled. When I foil I actually cut the point from the flat and put each half in a steam table foil pan then cover that with foil. Wont leak that way.Oh and brisket pro tip.

If it is a standard home you may very well be running on  gauge wire which is only rated to amp. If you have multiple items that run frequently they could be causing the draw to be too much. One other thing to check and possibly replace would be the breaker itself. Is it kicking off as well? I have dealt with a lot of similar issues and it is often just a matter of insufficient capability on that particular circuit or the breaker itself.

Have fun get in all your meats dont be hung over the next day.If you dont yet have one get a good graton slicer  youll want it for your ribs and brisket.When you slice ribs and brisket try to make your slices with one long pull.  You will get appearance dings if your slices are jagged or there are knife mark ridges on your slices.  Also make sure your slices go all the way through  you dont want any hangers!  I know a lot of cooks slice their six pieces of brisket pick them up put them in the box.  We slice each piece and set them aside to ensure each cut is complete.  Remember  judges cant shake apart pieces so if you put in six slices of brisket or six ribs and two of them are still connected youre not going to get tastetexture scores from a judge.  All those slicing comments also apply if you put sliced pork or chicken in your box.Also brisket  even moist  will start to turn greyish not long after slicing.  We make a finishing sauce of any drippings strained of fat  beef broth if we need extra liquid.  Each slice of brisket gets a light dip through this before going into the box.Remember to put six samples in your box!  Say you only have five chicken thighs that are cooked cut one in half.  May not be the best presentation but youll still get  in there.  And remember that the judges can take any piece they like.  If you only have  ribs youre happy with put in those six  dont feel you need to put more luck will have it a judge will grab the one with the burnt bottom.Make sure your chicken is fully cooked.  Theres a fine line between nicely done and overdone chicken and most cooks ride right on it.Watch your time.  Make sure you know how long it takes you to get from where youre setup to where the turnin is.  Ive had to sprint to the turnin setting down the box with seconds left.

5752497,0,t3_3ty30b,This weekend I smoked wings for the first time and made bacon wrapped boneless ribs which is actually  x  x  strips of pork shoulder.It was my luck that the maiden voyage was during our unseasonable snowstorm in Michigan. While I smoked it dumped about  on us. I had the smoker sat right next to the open side door of my garage with a fan to vent outside and the garage door open. My CO detector is in the garage also  not a single chirp.Temp control was an issue at first but like I said  first time on the WSM.The pork came out great. The bacon was crisp shoulder was tender and smoky. It was exactly what I hoped for.The wings were the star in my opinion. They cooked up beautifully in about an hour and a half at  and while they were nicely rendered they were not overcrisp. Some were tossed in buffalo sauce others in barbeque but I preferred them naked.All in all a successful smoke on a snowy day before Thanksgiving!,smoking,cxa5hti,1,t5_2qkku

I was smoking other things at the time like pork shoulders or ribs. Place on top of smoker racks and let go for the first hour and a half. Take out and let cool. They have a smokynutty flavor in them at this point. I made a smoked cauliflower soup using a recipe based on curry cauliflower soup. Recipe here Start the soup and add cauliflower before the coconut milk let boil a minute and put in blender uhm blend then pour back in pot stir in coconut milk and enjoy the creamy goodness.

6153222,0,t3_3zshxs,I think balancer is a better term than filler. I think of it like pink salt. The reason the nitrates are mixed with the salt is so that if you were to use too much then the meat would become too salty. So the salt makes it possible to get just the right balance of meat and nitrates. Paprika works like that in a rub. By having  of the rub made up of something fairly neutral but brightly colored like Paprika you are free to use strong flavoring like salt pepper and sugar with wild abandon. You can tell that youve gotten all the nooks and crannies covered and you dont end up addding too much rub. ,smoking,cyp22qx,0,t5_2qkku

I can dig it up if interested but there is this great mock smoked brisket recipe using a sous vide where the meat is first briefly cured with some pink salt and liquid smoke and then cooked in a sous vide until tender. Then of course broil or sear to get a crust. It is pretty good at a gastro laboratory simulated smoked brisket. The pink salt is only there for cosmetics. btw I mean during salt  not Himalayan pink salt in case anyone is confused by my original comment.

Botulism spores apparently thrive in anaerobic environments lowoxygen and are not deterred by freezing.My wife and I are trying to figure out if we can turn bacon into a side business legally.  Its very frustrating  the American system is very focused on the hazards regardless of scale.  Some of the laws are actually written in terms of tons per day.  From the FDAs perspective bacon is bacon and botulism is botulism no matter how much bacon youre making.A fair point.The French system is more liberal and is more focused on level of risk.  A producer making lbs of bacon monthly is regulated differently than one making lbs.  The hazards still exist of course at any level but the risk to the populace is much lower since theres just less of it to potentially spread the hazard.I dont live in France though.

7592189,0,t3_4j8359,Ive had one since Christmas. I would buy this thing x over. Its great. Check out there site and enroll in the server mode beta. Its fantastic! You can monitor and adjust temps outside your home network. No longer required to be connected to the grill or your home network. When assembling many people remove the left side damper closest to the pellets hopper. Ive great luck by keeping mine on but I may remove it next time I clean. With the left damper removed you can sear a bit better at high temps. Some people actually remove both dampers. This is of course only if you have the black heavy heat shield. The next stainless one alleviates this scenario. Dont foil the drip pan. Its easy to clean and its nice to get that little extra seasoning. The green mountain pellets are great. The premium blend have a great slow burn. The Texas ones taste great but do burn quicker. The fruitwood is very mild and burn faster then premium. The fruitwood doesnt do it for me. Spend the  or so and get the Don Godke down draft. Best investment for these things by a landslide. Im a fan of the amaz smoke tube too. ,smoking,d356znj,2,t5_2qkku

I really couldnt get the heat much lower even with all three vents fully open.In addition to the propane source I was using natural wood charcoal and the process was not too smokey.

8868244,0,t3_51gsfr,You are using bad information. Mustard or water pan has nothing to do with bark. Water pan helps with how much heat the air can hold therefore decrease amount of time it takes for you to cook so it has a purpose. Mustard does not it is flavored water does not even add flavor all it does is block the rub from touching the meat directly which is the exact opposite of what we want. It is an old school superstitious technique. Bark is made out of  things smoke particles rub and dryed meat surface. Mustard is non of those  things. Just skip it.You want insane bark on brisket? Follow these steps perfectly I mean perfectly dont just add them to your own routine do it to the T and you will have solid sticky barked brisket.  Trim a lot of the fat. Bark does not form on fat more red meat you expose more bark you will have. Remove the big handle looking fat piece off the back of the roast also go the sides and remove some of deckle fat lowering the thickness of the point a bit. As a general rule I touch the brisket if the piece of fat I touch is hard I remove it. Use a home made  Kosher salt  large grain black pepper rub apply liberally cover the whole brisket. Some will fall off its ok put more if a little falls off than put a bit more. Moral of the story instead of using a binder like oil or mustard and blocking the rub from touching the meat just use extra rub until the meat is properly covered.  Cook  F  make sure you have a water pan as close to heat source as possible. When internal is F at the point wrap with Butcher paper throw it back in. make sure water pan is always full Do not get it out until point reaches minimum F.  Enjoy your barky brisket. Better take a picture and post your results. If you follow these steps exactl I guarantee success.   ,smoking,d7du732,2,t5_2qkku

10238433,0,t1_dc4kh9z,There isnt a really good definitive answer to your question.  From personal experience I have found that I normally like to use wood smoke for the first half of the cook.  So depending on your cut of meat and its weight that might be anywhere from  min. to  hrs.  You could start there and adjust as needed.  And you dont need a ton of wood to generate enough smoke.  You dont want blue smoke billowing out of your cooker.  Rather you should aim for a thin ribbon of white smoke wisping out.  Dont sweat it if things get a little wild when you first add wood but less is definitely more when it comes to smoke.,smoking,dc4l0qa,2,t5_2qkku

10318811,0,t3_5nr2p4,I am not a brisket expert by any means but allow me to chime in with some basic thoughts.First I hate the idea of timing meat by the pound. Cook meat to temp.  A ten pound brisket that is  thick will cook a whole lot faster than a ten pound pork shoulder that is  thick.  That said because your brisket is so small you may find that that rule gets you close this time.  Still monitor internal temp and feel for firmness.Second cooking a flat without drying it out can be tricky because it is so lean with the exception of the fat cap. Dont trim the fat cap too thin and dont be afraid to wrap early and perhaps even add some liquid to your wrap pouch.,smoking,dcdoz4s,8,t5_2qkku

If you want to just hot smoke or GRILL them the Tender Quick will add a little pink color and Ive always thought it helps with moistness too.  One option is to add  cup of dried milk for a binder and moisture retention.My comments are in parenthesis the biggest change I make is NOT doing a second grind on the meat I prefer a coarse grind.   Here are some of my other sausages that are COARSE GROUND so you can see where Im headed. Bigwheels Genuine Texas Hotlinks  lbs. Boston Butt  heavy fat removed then coarse ground.  Bigwheels instructions below call for a second grind I prefer grinding once.  bottle beer  this should be icy cold  T. coarse ground black pepper  T. crushed red pepper  T. Cayenne  T. Hungarian Paprika  T. Mortons Tender Quick  T. Kosher Salt  T. Whole Mustard Seeds  cup minced fresh garlic  T. granulated garlic  T. MSG  t. ground bay leaves  t. whole anise seeds  t. coriander  t. ground thyme Mix all the spices cure and garlic into the  a beer and place in refrigerator while you cut up the meat to fit in the grinder. Ice cold meat will grind easier so keep it cold Grind the meat and mix in the spiced beer mixture.  You want the meat sort of sticky so you may need to add more of the iced beer. I dont do this second grind Run meat and spice mixture through the fine plate and mix again. At this time I rest my sausage in the fridge overnight so all the flavors blend  Stuff into medium hog casings. Smoke or slow grill till they are done.

No problems with the doneness and smoke flavor was good throughout usually theres not enough What I did different for this one was close the vents to about  open. I usually leave them wide open. I think I liked the smokiness level a bit more for the  open way. So what does everyone else do with the vents and to what effect?,smoking,dg8orx3,1,t5_2qkku

Sides will influence the serving sizes but some folks will only eat sandwiches and often two sandwiches. The yield on butts is about  to  but to play it safe use .  Serving sizes are normally . to . poundsperson of cooked weight but in this case I would go with . to  pound cooked weight per person worst scenario is  pounds raw weight per person  Doing the math   X    pounds raw weight.  Bear in mind these numbers are conservative but you dont want to run short of meat plus you may get some additional guests. Average butts are  pounds twin packs of butts come in around  pounds.    . butts  depending on individual weights.  A case of butts twin packs or  butts will come in at  to  pounds. If you are providing sides I would think you could get by with a case of butts if they come in closer to the  pounds.EDIT  this cook was about  pounds of butts and we fed   or  people men women and kids of all ages  to  at a after branding party I think the only sides were some beans and chips.

Best mod for WSM is a better door.Generally I never need to add coals to the original setup and avoid it at all costs. After the initial setup the bottom dampers are your best method for addressing the temperature. Just make small changes.
