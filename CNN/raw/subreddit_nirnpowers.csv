6286278,0,t1_cz3t6lj,Ah cave bears. Svanhild should have known at first glance. They were far too large to be regular bears and they werent white so they couldnt be snow bears that left open only the possibility that they were cave bears. Still cave bears in the Rift were notoriously aggressive. It hadnt occurred to anyone to try to tame them although there had certainly been attempts to tame regular bears with... mixed results.Svanhild kept her eyes carefully on the bear being led to her. Like most Nord women she wasnt unused to matters of war but she was no professional warrior. The idea of putting her hand near the mouth of a cave bear was a frightening one though she remained outwardly calm taking the salmon that she was offered without much hesitation.When it came to offering the salmon to the bear however Svanhild was... somewhat more tentative. It seemed friendly enough sniffing her rather than mauling her to death or something like that which bolstered her resolve. After a moments pause she carefully extended her arm to offer the salmon to the bear.,nirnpowers,cz46gbe,1,t5_396m2

7141419,0,t1_d1prp0l,Very well as you wish. Despite how bad this looks I did not come here to besiege your town. I came here to save it. However I cannot say the same for my counterpart Albinus. He wants to unify Cyrodiil for his own gain whereas the reasoning for my actions is for us not to appear like a platter of treats for the Caliphate too pick at. Which takes us to why Im here. As you probably know a state of war is likely to come to Cyrodiil soon and if I did not bring you under my jurisdiction you will instead be attacked by Albinuss forces who will force their way into your city and slaughter every last person in the keep. I want you out of this war because I dont want Bravilian ? men and women fighting in the ranks of his army. It would just make him stronger. So in short that is my mission and here is my offer. You and your family will remain in control of Bravil.Here the king started to count up on his fingers  Your army will stay the same and under your command. Trade will be opened up between Bravil and the rest of Colovia while you are welcome to keep the current trade you have. Lastly and this is the most important part you will nominally answer to me. This holds no obligation for you to fight my wars nor pay me taxes but to the outside world Bravil would be a province of Colovia. This will provide you with the protection against Albinus and Kvatchan armies would be always at your back. Furthermore you will have no obligation to Albinus either we rule dual kingdoms and you will be in mine not his.  So that is my pitch what do you say?,nirnpowers,d1pwion,2,t5_396m2

She had recently appointed Pegronir Shadypool to be treethane of Arnor after his fathers passing. Nirudras. The name had come up during her inquiry of the family. The eldest son. He should have been the one to take on the responsibility. The queen was aware however that he had left his familys relatively luxurious holdings to seek a life of fortune on the seas. To allow known pirates into her council chambers would surely be seen with a level of scrutiny. Though none could deny he had the right to petition for an audience.

The ornate crown of antler and metal upon her head was draped over with strands of pearl and feathers. The deep green garment she wore was open across the midsection and laced loosely up the chest skin exposed to the desert heat. On the left shoulder a bone pauldron extended into a bone plated gauntlet covering the whole of her small arm. On the right skin left open to the elements. A skirt of the same green silk open on both sides draped her hips.
