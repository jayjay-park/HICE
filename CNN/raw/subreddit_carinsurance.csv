5510717,0,t3_3qg71s,Somebody might have a more official legal answer but my dads car was declared totaled when someone hit me in it head on even though my car only suffered major bumper damage but otherwise worked. My dad decided rather than spend the k on fixing the bumper he just pocketed it. The insurance company never went after him.Honestly they are paying you to reimburse you for the damages. Its your money so you can do what you want with the check. IANAL so I have no idea if this is fraud or not but Im pretty sure youre fine just fixing it yourself in your case you could just say youre paying yourself for the body work.,carinsurance,cwg1lp1,2,t5_2rlxd
6580189,1,t3_45p14e,Oh good grief. Get the chip off your shoulder. No they didnt say they were sending it to their shop so they could do a crappy job of repairs and no your car isnt worth the sticker price. If you paid full sticker then you are stupid buyer and paid too much. And besides every car loses value as soon as you drive it off the lot with very very few exceptions. Yours isnt one of them.  I highly doubt they called the dealership to ask that because that isnt even close to how they decide the value of a car because what you paid is irrelevant. Whats its worth is whats in play. Everything you describe is absolutely standard for the industry. If you dont like it self insure and when you hit and total a  Mercedes and cause  in medical bills you can best the burden instead of the insurance company taking that risk for a few hundred dollars. ,carinsurance,czzy1f6,3,t5_2rlxd
