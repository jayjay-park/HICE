4135117,0,t1_crrkf2i,Bemani is already on mobile gaming ever since jubeat and Reflec Beat got ported to iOS Android has jubeat but it sucks. The worst thing that might happen to Bemani is that they come out with more touchscreencentric music games.IINM Yoshitaka is now in charge of Konamis Music Game Division. I dont think he would cock up the Bemani franchise anytime soon. ,bemani,crrmgu7,1,t5_2sb6k

4894313,0,t1_cuafb1p,gt as you are not discussing content using copyrighted material e.g. skins with official graphics BMS files of legit Bemani songs etc..Where did you hear that exactly? Just keep things on the DL and everything is fine. This sub is basically unknown to the masses and no one minds.edit wording,bemani,cubgu4u,1,t5_2sb6k
5358057,0,t3_3g6pnn,Yo if you havent already gotten this fixed and if I understand your complaint correctly vibrating springs What I do is wrap two small pieces of tape around the bottom spiral of the springs.  This adds some weight to the base to dampen vibration as well as provide some padding against the black plastic to further reduce any noise.Ignore the exposed line going up as I was testing things and that did make it stick on occasion. The bottom portion where it wraps around is sufficient to stop any vibrations and it wont cause the spring to stick against itself cause its only wrapped around one spiral. Doing only two sides also lets you orient it so that its between the white plungers so it shouldnt rub against those either Ive only rarely noticed some friction on initial install which I fixed by rotatingfiddling the spring a little bit and its always stayed good after.,bemani,cvwjw8i,1,t5_2sb6k

6121679,0,t3_3ze23f,I love lists like these! I recently found one for Popn and would love to see one for IIDX as well. Theres such a range of difficulties in the same level at the top of Bemani games. Even Popn with  more levels for distinction has this.,bemani,cylgz5b,1,t5_2sb6k

6467101,0,t3_3xxzse,I found the st thing to do when it comes to popn is get used to  button and pacing.One thing that helps me a lot is finding what Speed to set each song to.I recomend popnps or popnportablepsp as good entry into the series.I do recommend if you plan to master  button that you get a bigger controller But the whiteyellow minicon are acceptable though a bit sensitive. The way the game is designed seems to favor a bigger controller,bemani,czo8sg5,1,t5_2sb6k

9261879,0,t1_d8pfwc6,gt Apparently some of the U.S. cabinets Konami shipped over ...Has Konami started shipping cabinets?  Because I remember when the EU and US SuperNova and Fusion cabinets had issues it was because of them being manufactured locally  not shipped from Japan.Same issue with DDR X USA where the menu select buttons also mapped to the arrows meaning you couldnt enter unlock codes.,bemani,d8q0d3j,1,t5_2sb6k
9380243,0,t3_590fka,At s you should have no problem pressing any button without looking at them but you would struggle on how to read the charts and map them to hands. Therefore its important to not stick to a couple of charts rather try tons of charts in the similar levels not necessarily the same level level ratings at that point are dubious and the difference up to  levels is expected. PnM is a game with lots of charts  so this should be easy but dont be overwhelmed even though you cannot clear all of songs in that level for whatever reason Some more notes for advanced players After some point I think practically around  the rating system starts to make much more sense and youve got to clear virtually every song in that level to advance to the next level. There are some particularly difficult charts in spite of the rigidness of rating system thoughsometimes beneficial to try harder sometimes not necessary. At the levels  you would finally reach the point where you have not enough charts to practice without a harm there are only  charts at level  and sticking to them generally makes you worse. Thats why people tends to try RANDOMSRANDOM options generates a different chart every time at expense of reading difficulty around . Also you may have an option to improve the accuracy at lower levels which may slightly help but not very much. And at the level  you are just testing your luck in addition to crazy performance  I havent reached that point I had  unbeatable charts left for a long time.,bemani,d950god,2,t5_2sb6k
