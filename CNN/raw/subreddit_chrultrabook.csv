4848916,0,t3_3ha0ec,I dont have really much experience with going back to ChromeOs but first I would try to run the acript wirh cygwin. If that doesnt work I would try to boot ubuntu live from usb and try the script again. Or you could ask somebody with the same board to upload their bios but Im not  sure you can just flash it and be safe so do your research.,chrultrabook,cu5qpky,2,t5_39je3
4862454,0,t1_cu74zhp,Thats awesome thanks coolstar. But I already flashed back to ChromeOS so glad to be home. Chromeos  crouton is all I need. I was doing the SAME thing on Windows  except it gave me problems like low RAM and space. On top of draining my battery faster. There was just no point in using Windows other than to use specific programs Which work in crouton anywaysIm using a custom rom but at least I can use Chrome OS Thanks to your guide not mentioning anything about backing up our rom before flashingId much rather get a Windows laptop or Desktop for gaming needs. EDIT I deleted that public thread on chromeos sorry about that. Ill leave you guys alone. Now I feel bad about that c,chrultrabook,cu7g6lx,1,t5_39je3

5251869,0,t1_cv7suqa,Finally got around to testing this with your bat file.  Needs a slight modification  your sc create command line above makes the service manual start which doesnt work. You either need to add startauto to the command line or if you have already created the service go into services and change it to auto start.  Then it works ,chrultrabook,cvj1exp,1,t5_39je3

10104842,0,t3_5k3w7n,If youre gunning just for macOS you might be better off picking up a used windows laptop. There are a few that are compatible with macOS but I dont remember the name right now. Youd get better specs i ish and more variety. As others said the only version that works well with macOS is the C and i believe it has to be the i variant which will run you ,chrultrabook,dboo86e,2,t5_39je3
