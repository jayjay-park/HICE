9141418,0,t3_55hz9r,This is such a forgiving recipe. More forgiving than Jeebus. Just made it I screwed it up multiple times and it still came out great! . Only had  bananas found out it needs  after I defrosted them sigh. Softened the butter in the microwave some of it melted some of it was still hard forged on anyways. Where did my bread pans go? Theyve disappeared! Used a x square pan instead baked for  minutes  .  min would be better next time but it was still fine albeit a little brown on the edges. Just in case I didnt screw it up enough I added the struesel on top. It was fantastic!,GorillaRecipes,d8aqo0x,1,t5_3541n
