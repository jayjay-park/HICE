8599354,0,t3_4vn5n3,Unfortunately I do not have any specific recommendations for you as I only have a few different macro lenses. That being said...Telephoto lenses are probably your best bet as they compress and blur the background elements of a photograph due to their longer focal length. Telephoto lenses will make the background appear closer to the foreground. Wide angle lenses do the opposite  they make an image appear deeper as they expand the background away from the foreground.To get a similar effect you can use a camera app like Taru Camera which greatly reduces grain without overusing noise reduction like the stock app does in combination with digital zoom. It will smooth out the background similar to the way that a telephoto lens would but unfortunately since it is not a physical zoom you will lose some detail and sharpness at higher magnifications.Here is a quick example of what I meanSee how the background starts to get more and more blurry as you zoom in? Thats what a telephoto lens will do which is why a lot of portrait photographers use them  it makes the subject really jump off the backdrop.Heres a good article from Light and Matter along these lines,iPhoneography,d6gifxh,2,t5_2rsjy

10386758,0,t1_dclef18,Its been a while but all my editing was done with the default camera app. I upped the exposure and just messed with the slider bars until I thought it looked okay. The same effect could pretty easily be done with the right filter though. ,iPhoneography,dclejn8,1,t5_2rsjy
