1324240,0,t1_ciil6ua,gt But to be honest I consider say firefoxs history and simplestorage to be equally private. They both reside in the user profile unencrypted with only the oss permissions settings to protect them. One just have a nicer UI than the other.I can understand that mindset I just personally disagree with it because I think its way easier for a layperson to see your browser history than for them to even think  consider looking into your localStorage  especially localStorage for an extension...Just because I disagree with your opinion doesnt mean I dont respect it though I do! We just dont see quite eye to eye on that one gt All you need is one guy writing a script to get at them automatically and everyone can see every subreddit youve ever been in. Well everyone with an admin account on your computer that is. But I think theres still a lot of people who share one computer with all admin accounts say windows family computers.Rest assured thats a nontrivial task. Extension localstorage is sandboxed away from other extensions so that code would have to be injected right into RES somehow which isnt as simple as just a script.gt Not related to the above why does the subreddit dropdown store all subreddits not just subscribed or shortcutted ones?It doesnt I misspoke as Im in a hurry doing my real work work sorry ..

BTW this time Im only looking at .. in Chrome to sidestep any issues with Apple andor old versions of RESMaybe its something Im doing but the setting ScrollOnExpando doesnt seem to do anything for me when its on.  To work around this I tried setting ScrollStyle to Lock to Top so the expanded element would always be in view but it seems to behave how Legacy is documented.  That is whenever the selected element would be off the screen it gets moved to top.  It may be an interaction with ShiftJ though since it seems better about staying locked to top when Im just using J.basically I almost exclusively read rleagueoflegends and there are many posts and the posts get tons of comments and lots of img memes so Im trying to get things configured to make it easy to browse this subreddit with the keyboard nav controls.Also since nobody suggested alternative bindings for reference Im testing out these bindingsCommand | Original | New | Mnemonic|||Go Mode | G |  | vi like the JK bindingsExpando | X | O | OpenGo to Subreddit Frontpage | ShiftF |  |lt looks like a back arrowGo to Frontpage | F | Shift | ltIm not as worried about moving keyboard commands like A Z S R etc to the right side of the keyboard.
