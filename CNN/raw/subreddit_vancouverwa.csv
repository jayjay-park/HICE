Example If I own a restaurant and I hire a contractor to come in and do a remodel of my dining room and they quote me a number and then go  over their budget in just the design phase then you can bet that Im firing that contractor because they are doing a bad job.

3536582,0,t1_cpvdlct,Short answer it depends. Long answer if you have existing commercial power available to your location than you are looking at a much different system that what I have. I dont know as much about that type of system but you might talk to the folks at Solar City and see what they have to say. Basically with that sort of set up you use panels to reduce what you buy from the grid and on nice sunny days you may end up selling power back to the utility. It takes years to makesave enough to pay it off but it can be worth it even here in the northwest. If you dont have commercial power than you are looking at a lot of expense up front to build a system no matter how you make power. Some people just run a generator when they need power which can be cheaper in the short term but may cost more in fuel costs over the years. ,vancouverwa,cpve5rk,1,t5_2rjkh

7715770,0,t3_4ky9zh,Craigslist is probably your best bet the farm section not the pet section  . There used to be a rabbit farm just N of BG Lake. If you drive out past the lake and keep going to where the road makes a big turn left go to the right instead and it was right down that road. They had a big sign out by the road.If youre new to the farming thing I highly recommend you look into the WSU Extension office offerings. I did that when I had my small farm. Most of their programs are free or very inexpensive and very helpful and its a great networking opportunity to meet other farmers in the area.,vancouverwa,d3j8arn,4,t5_2rjkh

Also pretty pricey if you arent getting their flavor of the month special discount.Century link is worse in every way with the exception of customer service which is equally awful.  I think their pricing might be a bit more reasonable though.,vancouverwa,d4d60ky,1,t5_2rjkh
