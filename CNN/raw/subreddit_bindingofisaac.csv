28212,0,t1_cehmzcs,Microsoft at least used to I cant verify anymore charge thousands for a company to release a patch to a game.  On top of that IIRC from Indie Game the Movie they signed a deal with Microsoft to have a timed exclusive on the XBOX for SMB and with that theyd get front page on the storefront.  They didnt get it on day  and so not only did sales drop a bit game was obviously still a success but Microsoft broke its promise but they couldnt release SMB on another platform for quite a while.I cant verify this but thats what I believe happened. If you find something else let me know.Also I dont think this sounds like a hint at anything. It just seems more like him saying he wouldnt go out of his way to avoid having it on the XBone.

In your scenario I would have gone with the dime with the idea of a shoparcade on the next floor or the tinted rock hoping for another bomb andor soul hearts As long as I have at least one soul heart I will play the blood bankdemon beggar to half a heart.  Red hearts come often enough and dont help much.   In the beginning of the run I dont get hit often and the end I usually have given my heart containers to the devil.  In addition polaroid and whore proc at half a heart.Mamas Boy was my last achievement.  You want to try for  or  devil deals on the way.  Target flying and spectral tearsbrimstone so that you will get rooms where the enemies wont be able to hit you.  Spend time milking the first four floors for all theyre worth.  As far support items go mapping will help you find the boss faster and speed up will make it easier to dodge.  You can cheese mom with the bible.  Even if you get hit dont immediately reset.

Teleportation to DwtD rooms is a nice bonus. Plus Pyro is special and probably is less potent once out of the good special items.Stigmata right?!Scapular This was a hard one for me. Whilst it is true that Tec  offers nice synergies with tear effects Contacts Spider Bite e.t.c. it has a fixed rate of fire that is ridiculously high  once every  frames I believe. This can be good especially with Polyphemus but this makes late game bosses very angry. Unless you have contacts thats not going to end well... Also reduces value of tear up items like number one and Pact. Scapular on the other hand saves your life and breaks the games.

Most often this is done to reorder or to copy and paste sequences of input. Makers of toolassisted speedruns do not hexedit the games or the images or the sound. And like I said theoretically possible means that an actual seed might be able to produce a run like this which he has not verified thus it isnt possible. There is no way of verifying that the RNG in the actual game could generate the floors in the video because of the finite nature of pRNG in computers.

I took the nail because I needed the health and those spirit hearts really helped along with the health ups I got. A slot machine which never blew up even when I went from  cents to  gave me some tearsrange up pills and a lot of spirit hearts. I also found an arcade where I ended up with the highpriestess card. I got the common cold from a deal with the devil and that was the last item I got until the chest. I used the highpriestess glitch to breeze through Isaac. Got mediocre chest items and I was playing really bad so it looked like the end until I got a forgetmenow and took it.

2006667,0,t3_2hnkkk, MemBrain  Ive always found twins to be pretty easy enemies especially at that stage of the game when you usually have flight Brimstone or some source of heavy damage. Brains can be annoying with their shots. Chubber  The worst of Vislike enemies for me. MaskHeart  A fucking pain in the ass unless you have flight andor spectral tears Big Spider  His movement pattern confuses me sometimes.Most hated basement boss  Famine not the hardest one Ill give that to Gurdy Jr or the variation of the Duke of Flies that spits flies constantly but the cube of meat is almost a non existant reward.Least hated  Pin really hard to take damage from him.,bindingofisaac,ckv01ya,1,t5_2sxpk
2013977,0,t3_2hsnuo,Caution  Personal opinion below! Might not fit in with socially acceptable rboi mentality!Its pretty clear that Isaac has become a chore for NL.If you were to make a wordphrase cloud for the last  episodes it would be dominated by make our shop worth while need more damage ladder sucks dumb damage seams Im sorry if you hate  and maybe  or  other utterances.The tangents and commentary have gone downhill in a big way and I think its because he didnt always record  or  episodes in a single sitting.  The sheer scale of production required to keep up with everything on his plate has caused an unavoidable drop in quality.As someone who has watched since the beginning on a semiregular basis I can tell the joy is gone.  Some of my irritation is of course due to his nonsensical opinions about items or stuff like having the ladder and forgetting for the th time that episode that he can walk over gaps.  Some of the absent mindedness is due to needing to keep talking.  I get it.  Its NL and were used to it.  But when the commentary is just saying so I need to trade some of this health for damage for the th time that episode it grates on you.So in my opinion you should just go poke around in the first  of his Isaac videos.  Be prepared to rage at his totally illogical avoidance of any and all curse rooms and a bunch of other rookie mistakes but the overall entertainment value is undoubtedly higher than the more recent offerings.,bindingofisaac,ckvvq2z,17,t5_2sxpk

2190331,0,t1_cli80mj,Not necessarily. I mean it depends on the speed of the boss more than the speed of Isaac. I imagine the boss would move quite slowly. Slow enough that Isaac would be able to avoid it about as well as he could avoid anything. Like if Isaac is too slow to avoid a shot from a grandfather fly then hed be too slow to outrun the Wall. I mean the threat of the boss is reaching the end of the room before the Wall is dead. If its too fast then the boss fight would be too short. Its a boss so it should have a lot of health. If it has a lot of health it shouldnt die too quickly. If it shouldnt die too quickly then it should take a while to kill. If it should take a while to kill it should take a while longer to reach the end of the room.,bindingofisaac,cli8tdb,2,t5_2sxpk

If you manage to hit ish cents not difficult you can just start doubletapping on rooms with lots of small enemies and not even bother attacking them.Synergies well with Azazel for those rooms that are too dangerous to get close and attack.

Ive since become more familiar with many common room layouts and enemies and they are still unfair and can easily cheapshot you.  It all revolves around whether or not I feel like Im responsible for what happens.  In the original even when I first started playing it way back when I did feel like I was responsible for getting hit most of the time.  With Rebirth I dont.

There is a difference between saying you dont like the music which is an subjective point and saying the game has level design issues which can be seen in rooms where damage is taken no matter what.

First they review the game and then they think about what or how they would have made the game if they were a game designer. So something like non rectengular rooms is critique on a very high level  Whether it is a useful critique or not I do not know.Yet overall the article is really really awesome. He explains the game really well. For a person who has never heard of it it is the best review possible. Yet even for veterans it is very interesting. He does f.e. explain the religious background with Abraham and his son Isaac how the game is played random generated rooms  random items  boss fight each floor he talks about the obvious connection to LoZ how Edmund McMillen was unsatisified with the Java Version and wanted to make a new game and much more.Also one might disagree with the low points on the graphics but the reviewer says that the pixellook is nowadays used too often in indie games and some people might not like it because of that or do not like the look in general.

2490766,0,t1_cmjo5rk,The items in the list above are special items which means Edmund and some of the Nicalis guys probably decided they were too good to just leave getting them up to chance. So what they did was make picking up a special item decrease your chance of getting another based on how many you already have. When you walk into an item room Devil room Angel room etc. with an item the game randomly chooses an appropriate one to give you. If that item is a special item it runs the formula in the OP to determine if it should try again for a different item so that its less likely you get a bunch of really good items in a single run.,bindingofisaac,cmjojeu,3,t5_2sxpk

Whys Book of Revelations on the same charge rate as Satanic Bible when it means you have to fight harbringers and black hearts gt soul hearts?   Tammys head is a oneroom recharge and lemon mishap is two... Lol okay. Who the hell looked at dead sea scrolls and thought Oh better make that a  room recharge or itd be too strong! Thank god Yum Heart has a  room recharge right its just too strong. Guppys head has a  room recharge. Box of spiders is double that.  They do almost exactly the same damage except flies are better at tracking enemies than spiders. The bean is a  room recharge and the Red and Blue candle is infinite use on a delay.  Alright.Dont get me wrong I dont believe Krampus Head is a bad item.  Far from it I still think its actually pretty good.  I just dont see the reason for nerfing the items when theres so many other things that will never get changed.I dont see why Kamikaze and Dead Sea Scrolls arent getting changed if balance was even remotely a factor to consider in the games design.

Red poop as it is does a ton load of damage to enemies and since it cant be removed is equally threatening to the player. So having a no cooldown red poop item that hits you when you place it seems balanced to me kind of like how kamikaze is useful only  of the time seems balanced.

Its ok to have the same bosses i dont mind but at least add something new to them. You have different versions of the same boss that in reality doesnt change that much at all. Why dont you change the patern of attack like monstro with homing tears or something like that. I am asking this because lets be honest we all know the patterns of the bosses now.

If it had an AOE that was pretty big how about the farther away you are the less dps the aoe does and the closer the more it does. The AOE would increase ring range ups and dps upgrades would just make it more potent while tears ups would just make the ticks faster.Flying wouldnt be needed make the AOE just large enough to hit enemies over gaps in certain rooms to start off with. While your damage would be piss poor against them normally with a few upgrades it would be easy. Also those rooms arent all too present early game well the first  floors that is. Flying would be a bit too much. We already have tons of flying items.I personally would actually like this item a lot.

The amount of good synergies that could come from this are already fairly rare with the large item pool and you would need to get this item before any special one for the synergy to work.  If you take the item early youd have to deal with terrible stats and not much else to work with and if you take it later after you at least have something to hold you over youd have less chances of getting a good synergy with it afterwards.,bindingofisaac,cn5ctf9,12,t5_2sxpk

You can also go straight to SatanSheol by earning a Devil Room after the Moms Heart fight and fight Satan earlier than youre supposed to. After you beat It Lives you also gain access to the Cathedral where you can fight Isaac. Beat The Cathedral and Sheol five times each and you gain even FURTHER access to The Dark Room and The Chest where you can fight the  endgame bosses.

Depending on how many bombs you canwant to spare this makes the haunt much easier.Also if you want to be safe dont attack him while standing in his line of movement. Its not that easy to dodge his charge attack. IF you do this make sure youll have enough distance to him so that youve enough reaction time to get away if he charges.Its tempting to stand in his movement path because otherwise the fight takes much longer because from far away you cant hit him as often as you would like to. As I said If you cant dodge his charge its better to be patient and hit him from further away.Dodging his bulletbrimstone attack is not that hard if you are careful and if you pay attention to his tells.,bindingofisaac,cnia0cc,2,t5_2sxpk

2997366,0,t3_2uf6r3,I think the game favours having spirit hearts if youre a decent player over red hearts way too much. Its much worse than in vanilla the HP cap the absurd quantity of hearts you get from skulls blue fires upgraded shops items like dark bum all make it so that you can usually get a nice flow of spirit hearts for the whole run. Devil deals also make it much easier presenting spirit heart deals if you dont have red hearts and not featuring HP debt. Hell the whole concept of devil deal requirements favors spirit hearts over red hearts.It got to the point that I usually skip HP up or eternal hearts after the first few floors.,bindingofisaac,co8oao8,4,t5_2sxpk

3035969,0,t3_2qrept,note I have not played all of the challenges in rebirth so these may already exist There is a challenge a youtuber by the account name of Nerdcubed made up he called it The Yes man. The premise is that all special rooms treasure rooms curse rooms boss rooms etc have to be visited first and completed before you can advance. Link to video  props to him. In terms of non challenges there should be a occasional devil room room where you can give up all your hearts get  evil hearts for every red heart and something like a permeant empierss pardon the spelling. Also maybe a split ending where towards the end of the game you can pick a devil room or and angel room you get an item that effects your stats maybe what I suggested earlier and then you either fight Mega Satan if you pick angel room or God if you pick devil room depending on what room you pick which will give you an ending where Isaac is saved and his mother realises the sin she has commented and is thrown in jail good ending or one where Isaac is evil and he kills his mother.,bindingofisaac,cocoehe,1,t5_2sxpk

3085512,0,t1_cohi0mi,Funny thing is as it stands the angel rooms are the ones that are pointless. They need to be more consistent. Angel rooms dont need an angel brimstone or any other special tier items. It needs more mediocre stuff like the pentagram ceremonial robes dark matter the pact and the mark. Items like these are what make it likely for you to come away from devil deals better off than you would if you had gone for angel rooms. And let us not forget you must skip a devil deal to get angel deals that plus only having one item should make up for the heart container cost of devil deals and justify having a better item pool. Throw blood of the martyr back in there and maybe some other solid damagetear upgrades and maybe angel rooms will be viable. ,bindingofisaac,coht8h7,3,t5_2sxpk

3108902,0,t3_2vqzuc,More technology syngergies I usually avoid technology because it cancel many item effects.    For example     moms knifetechnology the laser turns grey and has a huge dmg buff but it has low range so like moms knife the longer you hold the shoot key it will have longer range.    deaths touchtechnology the laser turns black and its wider.Also soy milk  damage upgrades i always avoid soy milk because the bosses have more hp the longer you play but the damage is the same so it takes too much time to defeat them. The only way soy milk is usefull is with rare synergies so it would be usefull to be able to buff you damage with soy milk at least in a slighty way. I mean if you can buff your tears with pholyemus why not damage with soy milk?Sorry for my bad english.,bindingofisaac,cok8imh,6,t5_2sxpk

You are always against the clock. And when youre in bossrush you only get one chance if you die with lets say Dead Cat in boss rush you wont get another chance.

One of my personal favorite panels was dramatic readings of awful porn fanfics but there are usually tons of different panels at each individual con.Also some anime cons have competitive gaming tournaments with games like steet fighter or smash if youre into that. ,bindingofisaac,covrj8u,6,t5_2sxpk

So like I totally understand why Ive been downvoted but I really didnt mean anything about her boobs. Basically Im an idiot and I thought the perspective on this drawing was in front of Eve so that she was standing upright but somehow only on one foot in a pose which clearly isnt physically capable of keeping a person upright. However I just realized that obviously Eve is lying on her back. Guys Im really sorry about that misunderstanding.

So I did a quick test following your methodology.     Isaac died to Mulliboom Started new run as Maggie Exited out of the run and the game Started the game back up chose continue Killed myself in a sacrifice room  Game Over.

That would be an interesting synergy with Epic and Remote Detonator and I could agree with it mainly because it adds another use to rarely useful situational item.D is very VERY rarely anything positive. The main thing adding it to the D would do is make sure people dont use it midcombat. That being said the reason D is special is the combination of effects. It has the gamebreaking power of the D and the Dwhich combined are one of the best breakingrun combos in the game plus the potentially breaking effect of the D. The only reason its not the best active item in the game is the fact that you can breakfast yourself if you use it too much.As for the other part special items are not supposed to be objectively the best items in the game. Most are situationalas most items in Isaac are and are really just a holdover from vanilla where a huge number of mundane items were special. I can see where youre coming from but even the items that arent instantvictory in the special items list only need an item or two to become instant win they dont need to all be one item victories to fit in the game.,bindingofisaac,cq33ks2,1,t5_2sxpk

3636650,0,t1_cq6cobd,Stopwatch is amazing but three bits of advice.. Watch out for jumping enemies. If youre accustomed to running to wear they leapt to dodge their attack reconsider that if you have a Stopwatch. Slowed enemies jump straight up and come back down almost exactly where they were originally. Ive died to Monstro that way.. The Stopwatch similarly messes with the Fallens patterns. Normally he charges and then Brims but with the Stopwatch the charge can be cut incredibly short and you can be caught unaware by a sudden Brimstone. I died that way in the Boss Rush. . The Stopwatch will make all enemies appear the same colour. They will all have the slow effect colouring regardless of whether they are a champion or not. I saw a friend die to an explosive Maggot.. Masks arent affected by the Stopwatch. Other than that a Stopwatch is practically a won run so long as you have good damage.,bindingofisaac,cq6t0bd,3,t5_2sxpk

Thats a technique that I really like. All I can do to add to that is apply that knowledge for combat tactics where applicable. At least with Best Friend there was still something to contribute despite joining in directly so late.

3870940,0,t3_34qcxv,I think the idea behind it is interesting but there are many flaws that are big enough to make the game boring instead of more challenging. Mainly the amount of health and the changes to the D. I dont mind the enemies being aggressive in fact I say that makes it more interesting but the health. My god the health. The health that regenerates. Thats just cruel. If you dont have enough DPS you are done. If your first item isnt amazing you are done. Before taking bombs as your first item was fine but now if you dont get something to get more damaged the very first boss might be disgustingly horrible. And of course now with the D you might not even get the chance to get a better item. I think the D failing to reroll would be fine but actually vanishing the item is awful. I used a reroll on the Chest and all my items disappeared. The only reason I won was because I got Dr Fetus as my first item and it carried me until the Chest. Theres a difference between making it harder to use or more risky and just making it basically useless.I cant say how these changes compare to the things that are different in Rebirth because I havent play that game and I might not play it on a long long time.,bindingofisaac,cqxirk2,2,t5_2sxpk

3947089,0,t1_cr65v7u,gttheres a benefit to making him have half a soul heartYeah but the thing is that were talking about people who programmed the game here. Theyre capable of writing code which will prevent those issues.Like imagine yourself as one of the programmers. If you made it so that the Lost had  health and you found that continuing the game after closing it caused the Lost to die then logically youd go to the death function and add an if statement which says something like if the current character is the Lost dont activate when this particular thing happens. Im making assumptions about the code but hopefully its designed logically and would allow the programmers to add something like that. And if that doesnt work then they could go to functions that trigger when you resume the game and say dont call the death function on start up if the character is the Lost... Except like the functions which resume the game should not actually be able to call the death function anyway lol. As for the health interactions I dunno. I dont think thatd be a problem. If you program the game so that its safe to assume that the player is dead when they have  health unless theyre the Lost then you could write all health interactions to work including  as part of the range. Like for example Whore of Babylon which activates if you have less than  red heart as eve or less than  red hearts as any other character. The Blue Baby works with this item because he doesnt have any red hearts. If there are any health interactions that get fucked up by having  health presumably they could be resolved by writing them to include  health as a valid amount.,bindingofisaac,cr67ara,2,t5_2sxpk

4350684,0,t1_csfxfrd,I disagree. Greed is part of a set of  sins. If we had a Greed transformation people would ask Why dont we have a transformation for any of the other sins?And like uRavidleo pointed out there are only  new transformations. If we did get a transformation for every sin and then one for the Mom transformation that would leave no room for more creative transformations. I dont know about you but I think the transformations are going to be more creative than you get to become one of eight characters youve already seen before. Both Guppy and the Lord of the Flies are transformations which turn you into a character that was introduced at the same time as the transformation. Like yeah the Mom transformation is confirmed so its possible that some transformations will make you look like preexisting characters but I dont think all  of the new transformations will be that.,bindingofisaac,csg1yxb,1,t5_2sxpk

4548168,0,t3_3dc9sd,So correct me if Im wrong but i personally have gotten both achievements and this is mainly because Ive never gotten both the cube and the ball in the same run. I might just be incredibly lucky but it seems to me that the chances of getting the counterpart is significantly reduced after picking up the first piece. It has never seemed like a  after the first horseman to me. Also the percentage being so low is a little misleading because i would say the probability should start once the book is found not once the library is found because thats when the run truly begins.

4576900,0,t1_ct7hgxw,You obviously seem like a beginner by saying this. Maggy has one more heart than Isaac but also less speed and more luck than him. The reason why people dont like Maggy is on one hand the speed  it not only feels really bad to be slow it also is  and on the other hand the fact that the trade off you get is not worth it  in any Isaac run you will have enough health to do devil deals and you will not get hit to use yum heart after the first floor you will have soul hearts.So yeah if you are a beginner the  heart containers and the ability regenerate  heart every  rooms might seem very helpful but as you get better you will always value damage over health. A short fight is always easier than a long fight.P. S. Lazarus has in comparison  less health a bit less range and  less luck which might have a bigger impact than I know  noticed but as a trade off he gets a pill and a unique revive which if used properly early on gives him more damage more speed more luck and anemic. Properly here means means at the end of floor one you use all your health and only pick up health after the revive. Cain on the other hand for having one less heart container already starts with lazarus revive buffs more damage more speed and lucky foot which can be used to get lots of resources in an arcade interestingly though he starts with only  luck.,bindingofisaac,ct7ix1l,1,t5_2sxpk

4691646,0,t1_ctlwh8q,The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is a D game with pixelart style. Only with this you should be able to understand that the DS should be able to handle it without problems assuming the game is well programmed which obviously is not or as I said before Nintendo wanted it to be New DS exclusive and told them to say that lie.SeeIn this screenshot I can count around  sprites D images that represent some elements. I assume the ground and walls are implemented with a tilemap which is a very old but still effective way to draw scenarios. There are some shadows which look like sprites too a few particles the disappearing tears and some GUI elements. Finally I can see a god rays light effect that I dont know how is implemented but it could be easily done with several techniques which are cheap in computational power terms.The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS could manage up to  sprites simultaneously.

4969819,0,t1_cukwnig,I dont believe him because he is in a video or a few. I believe him because he cites sources while also having two PhDs in related topics. Like sure you can just handwave stuff but we are talking about a guy who spent his entire life studying the book in question and all the sources that could be found. It is not an only thing of his and you can find enough of actual public speeches at the conferences I just didnt want to go into linkspamming.  Point is  I could easily say that I am annoyed by people who wave away somebody who is referring to sources analysis and has the history of working on it in favour of what? Alleged words of allegedly existing person about which we dont have even one legitimate written source from the period. Because sorry there exists no word of Jesus outside of Christian scriptures there is no confirmed historicity to him at all. There were however several characters around that time that share some specific traits with him and it is more possible that he is just literary construct than a historical person at all. Which wouldnt be the first in history of Jewish and Christian writings. Moses is a good example being largely based on Hammurabi.,bindingofisaac,cukze2d,2,t5_2sxpk

I guess The Bloat and Peep are annoying too but not nearly as much as the others.

5374097,0,t1_cvyk37e,Having said that that would be a funny way to mix up Blind.Have it pull items from all pools and assign random price tags to them.You see a ? in your treasure room with a one heart cost a free ? in your shop a  coin ? after your boss fight and your God Deal has a ? that costs  coins discount!. And then you pick up the one heart one and find out its Breath of Life.I cant tell if it ups the strategy involved or makes it even worse. Inclined to say ups since the other pools have less run enders and the added costs would be strange as hell but youd probably have to change the name from just Blind.,bindingofisaac,cvylo2i,14,t5_2sxpk

5480595,0,t1_cwc6l21,Youre absolutely right! It does looks like Nuclear Throne for sure but the mechanics underneath these visuals feel more like Isaac.For example  Each level is procedurally generated Each floor has a boss You move deeper into the game and it gets much much harder As you progress you unlock more characters There are  weaponsitems to unlock Tons of passive and active items There are itemweapon shops There are lots of little different active events that you can encounterI realize some of these things are also in Nuclear Throne but all of these games are quite similar in some aspects.  TLDR Nuclear throne doesnt have the amount of unlocksprogression that Dead State has.

Its challenging in that it makes you make a decision  do you use a bomb to get the item which is less chance for getting tinted rocks or secret rooms or sacrifice health for the item which may mean no devilangel room or get you killed.Personally I wouldnt mind it so much if it was only possible in say the Depths since you should have enough resources by then to either give up an alright item or sacrifice the resources.,bindingofisaac,cwjo6tn,38,t5_2sxpk

Youre immune against a lot of attacks deal solid damage and aiming is rather easy. If you manage to snag the dark bum youll be fine.The Guardian Difficulty   its not hard but it REALLY depends on your luck.

Whilst its nice that the time limit doesnt straightup kill you when it runs out the timing for damage when it does run out is difficult to tell when youre in the middle of a fight. And why  minutes of all things?

Edmund mightve responded to that tweet before realizing that everybody had their donation machines stopping at . The word choice of the question doesnt indicate that the machines were blowing up at . Edmund couldve interpreted it to mean oh the machine mustve jammed at . Of course the machine is capable of jamming and the reason it jams is so that people cant max it out all in one run. Jamming isnt a bug and its certainly not a hint at some deeper meaning. It just means you gotta wait until next run to add more to the machine.If you assume that at the time of that tweet Edmund himself didnt recognize the significance of that number then it truly doesnt seem outlandish to believe that Edmund was by chance unfortunately coy in his answer.Note I havent paid much attention to Edmunds twitter activity. If you can confirm that Edmund was aware of the significance of  when he answered that tweet then my explanation falls apart.

5594172,0,t1_cwqhso7,Hint Play as a different character each Greed Mode run. Each character has their own threshold of donation giving the Greed Machine a percentage chance to break equal to the amount of coins that character has donated. So if you donate  coins with Judas without playing another character he has a  chance per coin to jam the machine.Playing a different character actually lowers the threshold for other characters by the same amount that theirs rises. So to keep with the example if I then played Eden and donated  coins in a single run because Im super lucky Eden would have a  chance to jam the machine and Judas would have a  chance. Essentially its designed to promote diversity  keeps things from getting too stale with Greed Mode.,bindingofisaac,cwqicej,14,t5_2sxpk

5606856,0,t3_3rwwkd,Health Scaling It seems silly to only make two bosses DPS based rather than DPH based like every other boss. I understand its there to compensate for nonOP runs but they require a completely different setup. And they seem really out of place I guess? Like Hushspoiler isnt even the end of a run after doing it the first time so after that things seem like a piece of cake in comparison it doesnt make much sense placementwise.Other bosses can easily die to a DPS build as well but it kind of ruins DPH items if you are trying to kill either of them why make that many items basically pointless to even pick up?Belial Unnecessary change and should be reverted it worked the same way for waaaay too long and it doesnt make sense to change it now. It wasnt even super OP considering the start you have.Azazel I am personally shit at Azazel because Im bad at close range so I didnt see the point in nerfing him in the first place. But for those who are good with him I see the point of at least nerfing his charge time.Ultra Greed Half the time theres no time to even destroy the coins he already took forever to kill so why buff him even more. They should either get rid of the coin buff or his speed buff over time.Tiny Rooms Yes basically.Bad Secret Rooms I kind of dont mind them most of the time though I havent ran into a lot of them. Basically does just suck though.Penalizing Item Pickup To me if theyre going to take off points for items they need to go all the way and take off points for consumables. They also make the game easier you shouldnt just be able to get a Two of Diamonds and get a bunch of points for nothing.The Wiz The transformation is okay with things like Tech X but otherwise it can be annoying.Retrovision If anything I think it simply lasts too long. I dont get the point of it going back and forth and can cause a strain on people. They should at least only make it happen  times.Glass Cannon If they were going to nerf it they should have increased the charge.

5610088,0,t3_3ryr27,Exploring rooms seems to give you  points and clearing rooms seems to give you  points. So Id say if it takes you less than  seconds to go to and clear a room you should do it. Also the consumables that you get for clearing the rooms adds a lot to your score. So yes explore every room on every floor its worth it!    The time and item penalties are almost meaningless though you absolutely need to do Boss Rush and Hush to have a chance at getting a decently high score.

Its even worse with the angel chests now..EDIT someone else pointed out the things you can do to force angel rooms already... I guess the poin of the post is that Angel rooms are pretty pointless. I agree and they are even more pointless if you think you need them to fight Mega Satan Its upposed to be one of the harder bosses and you need a decent build to have a successfuleasy run for sure but in order to get the key pieces you are skipping devil deals that are pretty much needed for good runs.,bindingofisaac,cwu6lvw,1,t5_2sxpk

A more accurate description would be an extra optional midgame boss.its not alternate if it is not an alternative. if I ask my satnav for an alternate route and it just takes me round a different block before taking the exact same route it already planned I would not say it is an alternate route. even if by a literal defeinition it might be so nobody would understand it as so.again its not final. if you read my post I said that just giving a chest and an ending is not the same as being final. the mom fight and moms heart are not the final bosses even if the are as far as you can go on your first playthrough. You can go further its just that you have to earn it. same with the hush.I doubt youll find many people agree with you that their understanding of a chapter is two item rooms one shop and one boss. specially when there is an obvious chapter based structure as I outlined it within the game.its really not that hard to lie in four words.,bindingofisaac,cx1bs5v,1,t5_2sxpk

5724526,0,t1_cx6o9vd,I honestly dont care either way about the Stopwatch I dont see it too much anyway so Im not gonna get bent out of shape about it.  I think a lot of the backlash has to do with modifying items that should have either been modified a year ago or left alone.  With the Stopwatch I can see why people are upset its a highrequirement unlock that appears rarely and helps immensely with some of the harder runs for more novice players.  With this nerf it has become completely useless on the Lost arguably the hardest character to farm unlocks for meaning that if you dont have a fullyunlocked save slot youre really gonna struggle with the Lost unless youre some kind of crazy pro.  Yes they made him easier with the Holy Mantle unlock still needs to be unlocked thru Greed mode farming so its not an instantaneous here you go kinda thing but its still a very difficult character to go through the game with on Hard mode against some of the bosses Hush comes to mind instantly scaled health and bullet hell means youre more than likely gonna get hit x before the battle is over.  Stuff like the Stopwatch made grinding for these unlocks a lot easier and now its going to be harder for inexperienced players.  I think a lot of the issue with the nerfs is the lack of communication with the community.  More often than not its just hey surprise we just nerfed an item youve liked and used for a year rather than checking to see what people think about it.  It seems like they are making the game for a very specific audience i.e. people like CobaltStreak when they should be applying it as a more broadspectrum game for all skill levels.  Not to mention the fact that there are numerous unpatched bugs that go ignored while they go nerfcrazy on the base game.  I think its mostly a lack of transparency that is causing people to think the game has been made not fun.  With the numerous changes the lack of interest in communityinteraction from the devs and the crazy amount of bugs and accidental? time gated content Afterbirth has slowly turned this into a game that I dont love anymore.,bindingofisaac,cx6omh5,2,t5_2sxpk

Are you still salty that brimsnapping was removed? What about having to restart the game between runs? Werent people used to those too?gt If their concern is nerfing items that no one ever uses because theyre too OP they dont seem to be similarly concerned with buffing items that no one ever picks up because theyre underpowered. thats just fundamentally not how balance works. Look at a game like LoL since there are parallels at a very base level between champions and items. If a champion has a  win rate it isnt a huge priority because people will just not play it. If a champion has a  win rate its a big fuckin deal and gets hotfixed immediately because that champion will be in EVERY GAME even though the two are inverses.This is essentially the issue where there were a subset of items that were so op that you could literally only see underpowered items for the rest of the game and still win. In afterbirth around  items were added and Id say  or  qualify as ridiculously overpowered.

5817773,0,t1_cxi6f6p,well sounds like the reward of larger familiars is just not worth the risk of a larger hitbox for you. that doesnt make it bad design thats just your comfort level with those items.he says riskreward that because thats the crux of the games design. not every item can be OP or purely have benefits. its a balancing mechanic that works. it urges the player to make decisions on their knowledge of the game. assuming the player isnt leaning on a wiki game ruiner constantly for help each run the player gets better and can make more informed decisions. some synergies are great some are terribletrolly. some items require completely rethinking how you play the game consider the way certain challenges train you play the game. sometimes you take an item with high risk soy milk ugh in the hopes that you can get another item with high risk libra ugh for the high reward machine gun fire with decent damage. if you can wield it why not take bobs brain? its a powerful item but can be hard to control and blow up in your face. thats riskreward.fact is BFFS!isaacs heart synergy does exactly what it was designed to do. it doesnt need to be buffed or nerfed. you simply need to make the choice to take it or leave it based on your experience and comfort level.,bindingofisaac,cxi8z9v,1,t5_2sxpk

5840825,0,t3_3v7w8f,I agree that theyre not very good at PR but Id rather they be on this side of it than totally sanitize their communication with players. I feel like one of the benefits an indie dev should have is the ability to be themselves without higherups policing their actions even if theyre a little abrasive.And sure its annoying to not have things were used to from other games like patch notes or comprehensive UI but one of the design goals of the game is obfuscation of stats and mechanics. I dont always like that but I respect it. And I can see how Ed and Tyrone would get annoyed at receiving constant questions about implementing features that are in direct opposition to their philosophy for the game. Again they can be dicks sometimes but its better that than for them to succumb to all the wishes of the community. People who play games are usually not very good at designing them.,bindingofisaac,cxl9c5n,14,t5_2sxpk
5841929,0,t1_cxlef8n,except no ones going to throw away a great item for a character if it helps their odds of winning. Its got nothing to do with confidence at all. Plenty of people know they can win without Holy Mantle but no one is ACTUALLY stupid enough to throw it away thats just bad decision making at its finest. Its like I said with my Eve example earlier and why the D is terrible on her no one is gonna throw away something that is essential to a characters style of run unless they are absolutely crazy or absolutely foolish.So giving someone that and then saying but you can throw it away is a moot point and terrible design because no one who knows the first thing about the situation theyre in is going to do it because they know that that first item could be essential in getting through that run.,bindingofisaac,cxlejdx,-17,t5_2sxpk

Your argument would also apply to a character who instantly won if you typed all work an no play makes Isaac a dull boy  times over and for that you get some item unlock.

As you said there are  main reasons to play a character Theyre fun They have good unlocksAs you dont find The Keeper fun to play and he has trash unlocks you have no reason to play him unless you really really want  which you probably do. Hes not filler because some people like him and he doesnt affect other peoples enjoyment as they dont have to play him if they dont want to. except for If he had good unlocks youd have to play him. But you dont enjoy him so itd be a boring grind. As he doesnt have good unlocks you dont have to play him and you wont miss out on anything.Of course going for  requires him so youll have to play him anyway if you want that. This can be a problem as playing a character you dont like just for  isnt much fun.

The Hush is there for the fun of the boss fight.Ive never understood why fighting the Hush has become a risk vs reward thing.Gameplaywise and flavorwise fighting Hush has always been a declaration of facing your own death. So when you drop down that little blue chute youre saying I am most certainly going to die doing this. But who cares? THIS IS FUN!...Or you could just be doing it for the unlocks but thats no fun at all. Went down there once with Soy Milk  Tiny Planet  Explosivo.

The one thing that I would say to ease the pain of people trying to beat the Keeper is that you should try to kill Isaac first so that way you can get the Wooden Nickel. Why does it make a bit easier? Sacrifice rooms and coins scattered through the floor sacrifice one coin of health pick up another coin that is on the floor that way you have a chance at getting Angel room items more coins than what you started or a large amount of flies around you. That to me is what makes the Keeper fun to play also I dont know if I need to mention but getting Swallowed Penny as the Keeper is pretty fun. ,bindingofisaac,cy7sx0x,1,t5_2sxpk

But when I have a super high tear rate I dont wanna just stop shooting to explode my tears. Its kinda counterproductive.

There are actually two statues stacked on top of each other in this room and its possible that due to race conditions an Angel statueminiboss might spawn instead.This may have actually existed since Rebirth but because of how it worked back there two rocks being in the same space did not really do anything. Its possible that an automation method was used to convert old Devil and Angel rooms and it just wasnt accounting for the possibility of there being two rocks in the same room.Fun fact the Devil Room with the trip down to the next floor still exists in the files despite there now being an actual deal on Womb II can anyone confirm if it does have a trapdoor down if you havent unlocked It Lives yet?,bindingofisaac,cz0u2a1,19,t5_2sxpk

Whats more objective than the game designers systematic and numerical measure of your success? You dismiss daily runs because you dont really care about proving yourself. Is this not a subjective reason?You dont play as The Keeper because hes a Shit Character that sounds like a personal opinion or did you determine this objectively with your objective measurements of shittiness?Are you ignoring the entire process of needing to defeat the Hush and Boss Rush just because youve done it already?

6407135,0,t3_43g0dj,I was thinking of ideas for characters in Afterbirth and I considered what valuable traits the game has that might be turned into potential characters. It hit me that mapping is one of the most crucial tools in the game so I decided to try and make a character that might have that as a beneficial trait.Enter Jonah the biblical cowardly prophet. His active item Oceans Propulsion would allow the player the chance to plot out a great deal of the map while providing the risk of stopping only one or two rooms in or finding oneself prematurely fighting the floor boss. His stats would be overall mediocre except for high speed so as to run away from fights. Given his nautical disposition the Fish Head trinket also seems like a good fit for such a character.As for appearance many depictions of Jonah have black or brown curly hair and a naval hat might add that childlike Isaac flair. Oceans Propulsion would have the image of a happylooking whale.A few other items that I can think of to be based around Jonah as potential unlocks The Short Straw passive Luck down all stats up The Kikayon passive Provides Isaac with a second immunity period for each room.I feel as if this biblical character has a lot of potential in the Binding of Isaac. Please leave your thoughts Im very interested to hear what the community would think. ,bindingofisaac,czhxctq,16,t5_2sxpk

6464791,0,t3_445uza,Theres already a system in place for this. The game has six skin colours pink white black blue red and green. Some items change which of skin colour the character currently has and some characters start with a nonstandard one e.g. ??? Azazel The Lost. If a character costume has the right assets and appropriate flag set it picks the graphic that matches the characters current skin colour from the list. So far so good.The stuff you bring up is actually two separate issues. The problem with the Keeper is that his skin is grey which doesnt match any of the existing skin colours. To stop the Keepers skin from changing a new skin colour would have to be added beyond the current scope of modding wed have to replace an existing one and new assets would have to be created for every costume in the game that changes skin colour. Considering this would take quite a long time I can understand why they didnt do this.But for things like Whore of Babylon this isnt a problem since the jetblack skin already exists. What happened here is that some costumes that should have a changeable skin colour dont e.g. Bucket of Lard Fate and Mr Dolly replace the body but they only have the basic pink asset. There isnt any technical reason why it should be this way the devs just didnt bother to add the recoloured assets and set the appropriate flag on the costumes.tldr It already does this but in some cases it doesnt work. The Keeper would need a new skin colour and ton of new assets to get right the other problems are an oversight and pretty easy to fix.,bindingofisaac,czo05r2,9,t5_2sxpk

I could tell you about  stories of the game fucking me just by giving me wrong random consumable drop. Sadly dailies in Isaac are combination of luck skill and reflex  in this particular order. The game is as random as it can be. The only constant is the character that you are starting with the rest is just bubbly mess of finding the lucky seam.    EDIT and the things that you mentioned are a tip of an iceberg. Im not even gonna mention game breaking synergies that occur all the time and give you more points than going normal route or bypassing the goal again one guy can get few thousand more points just by getting lucky random Ehwaz rune drop. And what about cheaters? What certainty do you have that people dont mod in homing Brimstone or Shovel at the start of each run? None   So just go with the flow and dont worry about it.

6612925,0,t3_467mye,Todays run was one of those ballstothewall sorts of runs where you want to accomplish everything but the game juuuuuuust barely gives you the means with which to accomplish it.  Crickets Head in one of the mob trap rooms  Steven in another mob trap room  Lost Contact was just enough to push me into Boss Rush killed Mom with  seconds to spare.  I took Cancer in Boss Rush because I wanted the Wafer effect.  Boss rush took me nearly  minutes... got down to Womb  cleared it at  minutes fought Krampus and he dropped Lump of Coal  an Emporor card.  Womb II instantly teleported beat the heart with  seconds to spare.  Dropped down to Hush got Champion Belt in the shop Infamy and Bobs Brain out of the chests I only took Infamy and Samsons ChainRainbow Baby  Gnawed LeafRubber Cement in the item rooms I only took Rubber Cement.  Doubled Incubus with Lost Contact made Hush a breeze.The rest of the run was pretty much gravy from there.  One of the starting chests in the Dark room teleports you to a Devil room with Lil Brimstone.  At that point I hadnt taken a single devil deal hoping for angels in vain but I said fuck it and took LB anyways.  Everything after that was easy.   points rank !  My first sub finish ever.  This run felt like everything went just right.As a side note did Angel rooms appear for anybody?  It felt like Angel Rooms may have been removed since the goal today was to beat the Lamb.  I noticed there was no Mega Satan door in the Dark Room either.  It wouldve been nice to know that from the start as I feel Athame probably couldve helped me clear MomBoss Rush faster so I couldve potentially saved the Emporor card for the Lamb.,bindingofisaac,d03bz9u,1,t5_2sxpk

Almost died on boss rush had like  red and  black heart left when I finished. Barely made it to Hush. The fight was long but did only get hit once. Sheol and Dark Room were a real pain though. One or more hits per room on most rooms. Luckily I had Blank CardJera Head of the Keeper Dark Bum from Cambion Conception and Bloody Penny. I was producing soul hearts faster than I was losing them. And of course I could do the usual breaking for insane amounts of schwag. I messed up though. I could have had a bomb multiplication room on the Dark Room but I picked up the bomb before I realized it  and the room next to that had a battery! Never got a single bomb after that screw up.

Its sometimes better to rush for the boss in order to maximise your deal with the Devil chances. All bosses except Mom can be backtracked after you beat them.However its important to note that shops and item rooms only appear up until and including the Depths .If you have the health to spare dont be afraid to visit the Curse room. It can contain very dank loot such as Devil Deal items or red chests.Challenge rooms can be good especially if they contain goldenstone chests. You might be able to snag something like Cricket or Guppys head. But they should never be a main priority imho.Self sacrifice rooms are only worth it in Afterbirth in which they can be used to get to Mega Stan very quickly.

It freezes enemies and makes them take extra damage and causes them to hurt other enemies when you kill them which you inevitably will thanks to that bonus damage.

Im not a fan of this idea as while I get what youre going for incentivizing its use by posing the risk of losing it the remains health being one heart or less doesnt mean much when that could mean you die. What use is having Glass Cannon not break if the hit kills you anyways? If you really want Glass Cannon to break though I think itd be better if Glass Cannon broke from a hit that would kill you acting as a shield and negating the hit but leaving you at  heart.Or in case I misunderstood Im an idiot. Were you trying to say that youd like the item to do huge amounts of damage but not cut your health at all and break when you take damage?

I have  hours on this game and I love it when I see something new like this I think its super exciting and Id like to share that sometimes. And what basic rule are you referring to? Because it seems like it is you who has failed to read the basic rules here.

There is a lot of content to be discovered still and if youre just looking to continue youve got to play more than one run. However in the event that I misinterpreted the title of your post sorry. If youre saying you just finished Mom or Moms Heart more likely and are looking for more to do sorry if that in itself is a spoiler again keep playing. With most bosses youve got to kill them x amount of times to do things but Womb unlocks after killing Mom once. Im not sure how much youve played as evidenced by my numerous contradictory statements but there are a few more floors after Moms Heart unlocked after beating Moms Heart  times. So youve got a ways to go. Mega Satan is something youll encounter in awhile dont worryuntil youve played enough to reach it you wont really have anything to do with the information right now.

8448963,0,t1_d5xbcy2,The way Greed Mode works is that money is dropped per wave for  main waves then  boss waves and a special extra DevilAngel Nightmare wave if you wish to get the DevilAngel Room on the floor for  floors.Money is the main source of getting your items in Greed Mode since there are no rooms to explore or pickups dropped just money.  Whatever remaining amount of money you have left can be put into the Greed Donation Machineand at certain fixed tiers a reward is granted.  Holy Mantle for the Lost is granted at  coins I believe and its going to take some time to achieve that since the Donation Machine can also have a chance to jam.Also Maggie was buffed indirectly with the new Sacrifice Rooms.  I suggest attempting to find a Sacrifice Room early on Floor  or  and try to run through the first  rewards by saving a few Yum Heart charges.

8454438,0,t3_4vglhr,The random rock breaking only happens when an item pedestal needs to a appear in a room. It takes up a similar batch of memory that rocksfires do along with all pickups and when that memory allocation is full. In doing so the game will replace something already in memory without clearing what was there. So if a rock in that place happens to be in memory it will explode the rock place the item pedestal but then immediately move the pedestal to the appropriate place in the room. This isnt  what is happening but thats the simplest way I know of to do so. So if youre looking to make it happen pick up as many consumables as I believe that helps fill up that block of memory. ,bindingofisaac,d5yc951,1,t5_2sxpk

8636219,0,t1_d6kzkp8,This might be what you are saying but I think the decrease by number is what you subtract from the weight when you pick up an item. Generally they are the same number so the weight after you pick up an item would be  so you cant get that item again. Then the remove on number is the threshold where the item will be removed from the item pool. It is . so when you subtract decrease by from the weight the total is less than remove on and the item is gone from the item pool.,bindingofisaac,d6l4vfn,1,t5_2sxpk

Most of these are just terrible dud items. They are kind of like trolly jokes on the player that dont really contribute to the game in a meaningful way which is also a part of the game but theres SO MANY of them.

9651517,0,t1_da2eaxp,You suggested this in another comment so Id like to voice my agreement Im pretty sure this mechanic would work best as its own character. The Poker Face item could be retooled as a resurrection a la Judas Shadow or the Lazarus Rags.Anyway... if Im reading this right a player that knows all of the possible combos could just drop cards if it looks like theyre building a hand that will lead to a negative effect... which isnt a bad thing necessarily if you want to reward people who take the time to read the wiki and whatnot. One nerf you might want to consider in order to make negating the possibility of a negative effect a little bit riskier is making it so that dropped pickups are deleted use it or lose it.Id like a set of effects that influence room spawns like guarantees an Arcade on the next floor Devil and Angel rooms guarantees a Devil room will spawn after the next bossguarantees an Angel room will spawn after the next boss and Curse of the Labyrinth guarantees Labyrinth on the next odd numbered floor. Im particularly invested in the Angel and Labyrinth effects since these can be negative or positive depending on what your run is looking like. I guess the other curses could be worked into particular combos too although those ones wouldnt have to be next floor effects since only Labyrinth actually affects the procedural generation of a level.If some of the more basic hands are just going to be stat ups you might want to play around with effects that lower one stat while raising a couple of others.I figure a Pill Flush could give you the same effect as Spun but stackable...! and a tarot flush could invoke some combination of the cards that make it up.This idea is pretty awesome and creative! Good on you for coming up with it.,bindingofisaac,da2qzvw,2,t5_2sxpk

The way its worked up until now is Rares  Recolours Epics  Advanced Recolours Unique Effects Legendary  New Models with potentially new voicelines and effects.Meis holiday skin is the sole exception to that right now being essentially a Epic Tier reskin with a Hat except with the cost of a Legendary which is  coins because event skin. The only thing that debateably makes it a legendary is that her Ice Block ability got a reskin.Compared to what everyone else got from the event its considered pretty underwhelming considering Mei is the focus of the winter brawl.,bindingofisaac,dbbg6xe,79,t5_2sxpk

At first I would cross my hands using my left hand on the arrow keys and my right hand on the asdw movement keys but it was too awkward to play that way so I stopped. What I do now is I have two computers next to each other. I use the left one to shoot and the right to move. But since now I have two screens I need to cross my eyes until the two screens merge in my vision. It makes it so I can move with my right hand and shoot with my left hand without needing to cross my arms but I can only play for about  minutes before I get a really bad headache and start to feel nauseous.Also learning how to not get hit is important so you can take as many devil deal items as possible. You just need to be good enough at dodging to not die with you leave a devil deal with only  heart. This way you can easily get OP by the Womb.,bindingofisaac,dbpufnz,-2,t5_2sxpk

10200012,0,t3_5m294c,It was never guaranteed before but I found that blue womb very often had one.

10200248,0,t1_dc05sfs,What you really need is to replace boss armor with some sort of intelligent scaling of boss health based on DPS.

I doubt well get another Isaac remake and a simple goal like Delirium which  of people who didnt do a new file have beaten isnt that bad. Especially when you can just be Isaac anyway. I myself see Greed as a subplot. An alternate universe if you will. Lets say youre new. What are the odds you get a devil deal if new? I got my dad to try the game once and he couldnt beat the first floor much less not take red heart damage at the second?

Go to the location of the save files and look for a file that has a name like .abppersistentgamedata sort by Date Modified to find out which were modified most recently. Then just rename it to persistentgamedata or replace  with  or  depending on the slot you want it in.

10602406,0,t1_dd8zwr6,Its not that the design is bad but making the mechanics match the design would create an annoying enemy or just a complete pushover. While the shadows look fine that spider corpse is well a spider with a corpse. Unless its just a reskin a large spider that fires at you would be pretty annoying in most rooms. And the tiny planet monster would probably have orbiting tear mechanics which coupled with the straight forward designs of other tear patterns would create a lot of confused dodging when combined with other enemies.,bindingofisaac,dd9k2mg,1,t5_2sxpk

10668439,0,t1_ddfyzih,I love a good challenge but the challenge has to have some fairness to it it has to be designed well. Its like that Saw shit the death trap has to have an escape for it to really be a game. In a game like this I feel A every seed should be hypothetically winnable if the player is good enough B the deaths have to feel like your fault not because you were at the whim of circumstances outside of your control. You should feel like you made a mistake or that you died because you were unfamiliarCalling out some poorly designed aspects of the game isnt the same as dumbing down the challenge. Telefragging adds nothing to the Delirium fight but an arbitrary health drop. It does not test your capabilities as a player in any way.Its cool that you like the death cycle of Isaac and the random elementsbut what youre describing is objectively terrible game design.,bindingofisaac,ddgda1j,13,t5_2sxpk

If you make a temporary familiar Isaacs Head key pieces using Box of Friends etc. pick up a permanent familiar and then lose the temporary familiar drop Isaacs head finishspend the key leave the room etc. the first permanent familiar you had following it will move to the st slot and count as the start of the new familiar train even if theres one already there. This allows you to put every familiar in the st slot if you keep doing this. This doesnt work if the familiar you picked up is the same as the temporary familiar you made if theres only one and the train is set back to normal upon exiting and reentering the run.

11019263,0,t3_5xbfop,Thanks for the feedback so far everyone! I think Im agreeing now that the melee swing blocking projectiles might be a bit strong for BOI especially with tear delay upgrades. Currently thinking a bit about what other benefits I could give to Samael to make up for it. Again Id like melee to be viable so that you dont have to rely on the ranged attack so I didnt want bosses that shoot a bunch of bullets to be impossible to melee. Ive been thinking about another possible ability for him and Id like to hear what people think.I was thinking about a recharging ability not taking up his active item slot perhaps activated with shift? that allows him to become temporarily immune to damage and phase through everything taking on a spectralwraith form. This would theoretically allow you to close into melee distance. It would last only a short duration and would also end if you attacked. Upon exiting the wraith form projectiles are destroyed within a small radius around you possibly also stunningslowing enemies to give you a free moment to attack with melee. The ability might take a decent amount of time to recharge probably sped up if youre dealing damage or killing enemies.Probably sounds powerful but is it more powerful than the scythe swings blocking tears?

Hush was a joke with the amount of damage. I found Forget Me Now completed the whole floor and used it. I remember in the past when I used FMN on the Void it was the same floor layout but I may be confusing it with Undefined and Error Room shenanigans.

The exact differences according to the wiki    Rooms contain more advanced enemies and in a higher number.    Causes champions to spawn more often however they award fewer consumables.    You are less likely to receive hearts after completing a room.    Only champion bosses drop red hearts.    You are more likely to be cursed on each floor.

11791044,0,t1_dgwf1t6,The link is a search for Angel Statue Devil Room and it fails  of the time for me too but it is a working link I just got it to work I think reddit is fucking up right now. A lot of people were making posts about this when a bug was fixed about  months ago. The bug affected the entire game since Rebirth. In this game there is something called stacking where two or more entities are stacked on top of each other and are given weights so that one of the entities in the list can spawn depending on the seed. For example the donation machine in the shop has like a  chance to show up with a reroll machine having a  chance to appear not sure if those are the actually percentages. However there was a bug where the first item on the list was picked every single time. Thats why despite being programmed into the game since Afterbirth there was never a reroll machine in the shop until a bug fix earlier this year. For devil rooms there is apparently a  chance to get an angel statue. But due to the stacking bug it would always just pick a devil statue. Once that bug was fixed the angel statue started appearing and for a brief period of time this subreddit was flooded with maybe  posts a day with screenshots of the angel in the devil room. Im not sure how you werent able to find anything using the search bar. ,bindingofisaac,dgwjz2v,3,t5_2sxpk
11792395,0,t3_688ln4,Nothing too crazy missed boss rush because fuck this run managed to never get hit by Fire Mind so missing BR at the end is compensated by a rather small .k DMG penalty and found an ehwaz on a sack on the last room of W. Sac room on sheol but had only  soul hearts. points | Greedbutt  .,bindingofisaac,dgwphmy,1,t5_2sxpk
11792659,0,t1_dgwptbo,Thanks. I wasnt sure if that would help or not since the DS is supposed to be natively supported in isaac Im assuming since it reads and displays the correct PS buttons on screen. Ill give it a go today. ,bindingofisaac,dgwqkf6,1,t5_2sxpk
