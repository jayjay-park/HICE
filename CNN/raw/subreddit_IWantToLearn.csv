324989,0,t1_cfefqoo,So there is no such thing as perfect. Even the relative doneness of a piece is subject to much debate as is the point of a group critique. Thinking about pieces and how to improve them is just as much a skill as knowing how to take that advice and actually improve your skills because they are separate things. How fucked up is that?I would say let the direction emerge just modify the system you are currently working with. Anybody that gets too focused on one thing will ultimately become bored with it. If you are really stuck more than howtos or these high concept theory books look to art that makes you go holy shit I wonder how they made that and then try to make it yourself. It will suck and it will be imperfect but you will be one step closer to actually pulling it off. As far as improvement focus on shortterm achievable goals. Remember how to eat the elephant. If you try to stack tones from and proportions on your plate at once you will fail and if you do create something it will not satisfy your taste. Imagine if you had worked incrementally because IMO  kinda interesting drawings beat one ambitious but underwhelming effort every. single. time.The root of all disciplines is problem solving and one of the facets of problem solving is mitigating difficulty. The best way to mitigate difficulty is to have someone solve the problem for you or help you figure out the solution. But if you want the self satisfaction and general boost in esteem that comes with accomplishment the second best option is to break problems into smaller problems until eventually they become manageable.As far as practice goes just do it. Dont expect improvement but always try to work towards it. Drawing the same thing over and over again isnt going to result in anything other than being able to draw that one thing really well. I cant really think of anything else to say at the moment but Ill reply if I can think of something else really useful.P.S. Wouldnt you know it no sooner than the save button is hit I dont know if you live in an urban area or not but you should see if there is a city or regional sketch group.

344694,0,t3_1xzvn3,You might be interested in this He try to give you an intuitive understanding of the exponential function.A TLDR of the video would be Take the inflation rate t. Now divide  per t t. That is the doubling time. Thats the time for the prices to double i.e. the time for money to devalue half. So if for example the average inflation is  per year just took it from a quick google it might be wrong    years. That means that   years ago   which is close to your  dollar was worth    of todays dollar. So  would  be   .After I made this example I checked some calculations online and my estimate is way off. Thats because  is not very good for . But if I took  years ago my estimate would be  in    in  and it turns out to be  which is kinda close.So if you wanted to be more precise youd have to get good approximations for inflation rates in different time intervals. For example a rate for today other for  etc and use the above calculations several times.If you want more details such as a demonstration to why  feel free to ask.A quick edit. Realize that what I just did was to trade an exponential for a division which can be done in your head. And this is pretty precise. The problem comes from estimating the actual average inflation rate.,IWantToLearn,cfghw2r,3,t5_2rjo5

410434,0,t3_1ysa62,Most people are just as lost and scared as anyone else even when we get older. There are a few things I have discovered to be very nice tools to make my adult world make more sense  Make a budget. This means know how much your income is figure out how much food rent clothing coffee cigarettes alcohol space probes and all the other things costs. This will leave you with a nice playing field where you know what you can spend without getting into trouble. Sure it might be boring but I find it useful because I dont have to stress about money at all.  And while you are at it save some of the money so you have emergency funds. Dont do tomorrow what you could have done yesterday.It is Very nice to not let things hang over you because this generates stress. Just bite into it make those phone calls write those emails or tell someone you cant make the party because you dont feel like it.  Be honestThere are Plenty of people lying helpfully. I rather have someone telling me straight up whats going down. I can trust them when it counts and I know they are not afraid to be uncomfortable if the truth need them to be. That spells for good friends to me.  Work to live. Dont live to work. Do things that makes You happy. No matter how silly others might think it is. A job is fine if you really like it I rather hold a job which I am fine with but that I dont care too much about. Leaving the job at the job is worth very much to me.  Do your dishes right away.This way it wont get all dry and a pain in the ass to clean and it will help you get rid of the Ill do it later mentality.  Work out.It can be small things but just taking a long walk to clear your head and getting some fresh air into your lungs will help you.  Know that people are peoplePeople makes mistakes. Find those that own up to them because those are the ones learning from them. Someone that blames the mistakes on others will never learn.  Depending on how your system works where you live Read up. Read up on laws regulations and contracts. All of these are there for good reason and knowing them will give you a very handy edge if you ever get into an argument with someone higher up the ladder than you. I live in Sweden and you cant be fired on a whim here so knowing these things will give you serious leverage here. Id be more careful with this in a world where you are less secure.  TALK TO YOUR PARTNERNoone is a mind reader. Not even those who claim that they are. Never assume that who ever you live with or work with knows what you are thinking. And make sure they understand that you do not read minds either. This will turn silent fights into constructive conversations and you will be better off in all parts of life because of it. I cant be specific and help out with books I am afraid. I think it is good you are trying to figure out the world with the help of others. Many of us has been in the dark looking for the door without asking for help. ,IWantToLearn,cfnb3ak,85,t5_2rjo5
418185,0,t3_1ytr8a,Before I talk about the techniques I use I just want to quickly mention that most of the time people have trouble remembering names is because theyre not practiced listeners.  You hear what people are saying but dont pay enough attention so it goes in one ear and out the other.  You just dont retain it.  To really take in new information you really have to really focus hard and pay attention to what people are saying during conversation.  It sounds easy  but it is really difficult at first.  It takes a lot of practice.  But keep at it and it will become totally natural and you wont even have to think about it anymore.Some General TipsWhen first starting out with active listening try summing up what the person says in conversation periodically in your head.  Try and recap the conversation after its over.  Recall details about it.  Specific phrases or items they mentioned.  Even if it doesnt seem important.  Just the fact youre remembering details will start you down the right path.  Write it down if you have to.  Youll find that you start remembering these kinds of things more naturally as time goes on.But a couple tricks that I use specifically about remembering namessome have already been said Repeat their name in conversation. Ask them to spell it. This takes a bit of practice but if you already know someone with the same name then try and imagine this new person imitating the person that you know.  Like wearing their clothes and faking a voice.  The more ridiculous and vivid the better.  Make it crazy.  It will mentally relate this new person with one you already know and create a stronger connection with the name.  But again this takes practice.I guess the main points though are practice and pay a lot of attention!,IWantToLearn,cfo3zt6,1,t5_2rjo5

There are ways to gauge a persons level of comfort and determine which subjects may need to be revisited but even after a very successful career as an FBI agent hes still only able to tell when somebodys lying about half the time.

You dont have to return the hurt that your ego feels.Try to see them as  kids throwing tantrums. Sometimes kids do it but people dont get lost in those tantrums they keep calm and remain being adults.Remaining calm and handling a situation alot of it is in your hands. It requires a lot of emotion to cause a conflict atleast for normal people and it isnt easy maintaining that level of emotion just by yourself. Its only when theres someone fighting you back that you can maintain that level of anger. Be really really nice to them and see them as they are people having a bad day and they wont be able to maintain their level of anger many times. It has to do a lot with your voice and stance too. Always try to stay at ease physically like when you are relaxing after a day at work. You dont walk around erect and alert like the alpha dog you do what feels easy to you. Keep your body like that at ease.Your voice theres a certain tone of pleasentness you use when meeting people for the first time use that and keep to it.If the situation as escalated too much just try to stretch out the time by asking them questions or doing something and try not to do anything at all.

Presence means that your mind is completely focused on the current moment not busy thinking about your problems or something irrelevant when youre interacting with someone. Power as well as warmth is perceived mostly through your body language. It matters because people first assess your status do you have power. And secondly they assess whether you like them or not.

Just dont get lazy and you fix half of your problems.So for thinking before you speak a lot of people will recommend this but meditation is perfect. Take time out of the day to take time out of the day. In other words set aside time close your eyes and breathe. When a thought appears just acknowledge it and let it pass. This helps you as you live life every day and you start thinking about terrible things or you start stressing out. Just acknowledge the thought know that its there but let it go. Thatll help you it will make sure that you dont say anything bad. It helps from getting your emotions out of hand. If meditation isnt your cup of tea go out for a walk or a run. If you dont like that do whatever it is that helps you relax. Even if its laying down and closing your eyes. Just relax get a better grasp of the situation breathe and know that you are with this girl because you want happiness. Is fighting worth it? Is arguing worth it? Is stressing out worth it?

One of the things he said to do was ask yourself Whats the worst that could happen? Meaning that you should figure out what can go wrong before it goes wrong. That way you can prepare ahead of time for it. When a fire occurs on the International Space Station they dont float around screaming. Theyve practiced the firefighting procedure hundreds of times over several years. They become disconnected from the shock of a situation that catches them by surprise so anything that goes wrong can be solved in a calm and measured manner. All they have to do is follow their training.So ask yourself Whats the worst thing that can happen right now? Like if youre moving what causes the anxiety? Is it damaged furniture? Make that stuff impossible to shift in transit and pad the hell out of it. Is it finding an apartment? Prepare lists of features you want ahead of time areas you intend to visit things to ask the leasing agent..etc. Ive actually compiled a list of things for when I look at apartments and even though I may look silly I just look at my list and know that if I stick to it Ill find the right place for me. ,IWantToLearn,ciuxzd1,4,t5_2rjo5

1802401,0,t3_2f1k74,Didnt see this tip posted so I will chime in.Lets reframe your question a little.  Instead of focusing on notetaking strategies lets look at the underlying question How do I get the most value out of a lecture? A lot of students treat a lecture as a oneway flow of information from the teacher to the student.  The teacher pushes out new information the student records that information.  In this view of a lecture the teachers job is to present the material in an organized clear and understandable way.  The students job is to figure out which parts of the lecture are important and record those for later study.  Fuck that.  I used to treat lectures this way and it is awful.  Lectures become extremely boring.  The teacher spends ten minutes on a topic going into various details but Ive already taken down the important part in my notes so the details seem unnecessary and irrelevant.  Or perhaps I decide that all of the details are important and my entire focus shifts to faithfully capturing every detail  a process that requires a lot of physical effort but very little mental effort.  Either way Im not spending any time actually thinking about the information itself  Im simply recording it.You want to avoid this awful dynamic? Theres simple solution but its not an easy solution as you will see. Study before the lecture.  If there is assigned reading for the lecture do the assigned reading.  Go at your own pace and try to understand the material as best you can before you step foot into the classroom.  Take notes.  Identify concepts that you dont understand on your own.  If there are practice problems or drills do them.  If you have the answers check yourself and see where you went wrong.  If you dont have the answers identify which questions were the most confusing or difficult for you.Most of your work should be done before the lecture occurs.  Then when you step into the classroom youve already formed your own understanding of the material.  Youve already figured out which concepts you understand and which concepts you need help with.  Youve already tried to apply the material if there are practice questions.  If youve done this the lecture becomes a very different experience.  The information isnt completely new to you.  As you watch the teacher go through the material you can compare your understanding with the teachers  this allows you to see differences and understand concepts in a morecomplete way.  Because youve already reviewed the material you can engaged with the teacher.  When the teacher goes over a concept that you couldnt understand on your own youll be able to really focus the reason why you missed the concept on your own and youll learn the concept much better.  Youll be able to ask questions based on your prior attempts and through questions you can engage in a backandforth with your teacher that actually teaches you something.  During a break or at the end of class you can even go over a practice problem or two that gave you trouble and get a very specific response.  All of this will result in greater participation on your part  both outwardly and inwardly  and this will generate a better relationship with your teacher.  This will help your grades because teachers are people too and they are more likely to grade you better if they know that you are doing the work and you are engaged in the class.  After the lecture ends youll have a much better picture of the material which will give you better preparation for the next lecture because most courses are designed to build on concepts as the class moves through the semester.  If you really want to cement the material you should wait a day or so and then review the material plus your lecture notes and revisit the practice problems if any to see if you can do them perfectly.  As you get closer to the final paper or exam you can then repeat this process.  This strategy is the best way to learn in a lecturebased class.  Unfortunately its not easy.  Instead of expecting the teacher to spoonfeed you the material at a once or twiceaweek lecture you are doing the bulk of the work.  You are taking charge of your learning experience and this requires commitment time and serious mental effort.  This strategy works but it isnt easy.  Its a lifestyle change not just a notetaking method.  But if you can make this your method of learning then when you get into the real world youll find that you possess an intellectual independence and a takecharge attitude towards selfbetterment that many of your peers will lack.  This will lead to better career growth and success.  My final tip its easiest to do this with a study group of likeminded folks.  Both the preparation work and the postlecture review are easier if you can bounce ideas off your fellow students.  A study group will keep you accountable to others and not let you fuck off to reddit instead of studying.  It should be a real study group however! Not just a social get together with a little light studying on the side.  Good luck.,IWantToLearn,ck6cfai,3,t5_2rjo5

1940164,0,t1_ckmm1wy,Rather than just silently downvoting you Im going to take a moment to actually explain why what you just did is useless in the hopes that maybe you will think twice before you do it again. If you cannot contribute anything useful to a conversation particularly in a subreddit like this askscience or ELI you really shouldnt say anything at all.First off the internet is full of bullshit even in places that seem reputable. If I know absolutely nothing about how the vocal chords work and I am presented with that exact set of google links I am going to randomly click links and try to piece together information in my head. Depending on how much I care and how much time I have I may click one link I may click ten. Either way this is very inefficient and can sometimes take hours depending on the source material... and still has no guarantee of being correct.When anybody asks a question here what theyre hoping for is that the post gets popular enough that  someone knowledgeable in the subject will see and answer and  that enough people will visit the post and upvote correct info and downvote incorrect info. It democratically sorts out the bullshit usually at least and ensures with relatively high probability that the top comment or top few comments will be relevant correct and useful.On a more specific note That particular google query returns instructions for singers and mostly singers who want to sing higher rather than lower. Changing the query to how to lower your vocal range returns instructions for lowering your range which is still not what OP wants. OP wants to project their voice the loud and powerful part and through context it is assumed they want to improve the quality of their voice when they say deep rather than literally lower the pitch. OP very well may have spent  minutes trying various google keywords with very little success finding the information he seeks some people are not very good with effectively choosing google keywords and would have a lot of trouble stumbling onto a phrase such as how to project voice and improve timbre which returns fairly useful results. Now if someone is asking about a fact or about a specific method which is fairly reliable sure suggest google... but remember that most of the time people have already tried google. Maybe theyre just bad at keywords and the amount of effort it takes to create that lmgtfy link is at best the same amount of effort to just get a link from google directly... sometimes more. Ultimately using a lmgtfy link is just being unnecessarily snarky. ,IWantToLearn,ckmzhek,16,t5_2rjo5

2240216,0,t1_clol28q,Part !As for your questionsYou are the right track. For front end you absolutely need to know HTML CSS and JavaScript. By know though I dont mean bywrote memorization. Thats what documentation is for. The MOST valuable thing you can do when learning front end tech is to set up a dev environment that allows for quick iteration and to be able to test in multiple browsers effectively the second thing probably the more important of the two but they go hand in hand because even though browser vendors make an attempt to follow web standards the standard for how each browser decides to render HTMLCSS and interpret JavaScript they dont all conform  to the standard and they each conform in different ways. So what you need is a machine that has latest Chrome Firefox Safari For Mac AND Windows and some way of testing with the versions of Internet Explorer that hole the most market share currently. You have to test your work in the all of these browsers in order to ensure that your end product looks and functions the same way on all platforms. What I just described in the biggest pain when it comes to front end development. You may be thinking ugh what a hassle and youd be right. When I started Old fart story incoming I had to make sure things were working in IE a hellish spawn of Satan firefox and safari. That may not sound like much but IE was absolutely terrible in terms of what it would support featurewise and its abysmal rendering engine so buggy!. IE has gotten better over the years but Microsoft still insists on doing many things their own way. This brings me to my next point when is comes to choosing which features to when when developing for the front end you have to work to the lowest common denominator that is the feature set support by all major browsers if you want your front end layer to function the same way for the largest possible audience. If you are creating some experimental application a demo of some kind meant to show off a particular feature of a browser or some intranet application meant to be used strictly internally by a business then you can get away with ignoring a particular browser.I havent even mentioned testing for mobile devices and browsers. On the cheap you can find emulators for these kinds of things so you dont have to buy every gadget that comes on the market. Also youll find virtual machines handy for multi browser testing. For instance if you have a Mac but you need to test IE you could install windows as a virtual machine on your Mac and test against IE there.So the big take away here is to get a development environment together that you are comfortable with that allows you start getting used to testing against multiple browsers. No way around it.As far as practice thats tough because every project is unique. I would say create some kind of site for a purpose of your choosing that features a number of common web app idioms. Site navigation using different menu types hierarchical drop down menus are a mainstay. Maybe a database of some kind for items you own. A popular exercise back in the day was to make a CD database for all your music but who uses that anymore PThe point is pick something that has that application feel to it lets you create data read data update data and delete data or CRUD for short.Ok Ill mention one other thing to learn Design Patterns. You may be familiar with some already. Design patterns are just common solutions to common problems encountered by developers. The patterns are so useful that they have been codified so that they can be identified by name which makes it easy for developers to discuss them alter them or in some cases despise them.There is one pattern in particular that is very useful when creating applications  including web bases applications  and thats the MVC pattern or Model View Controller which are the main components of the pattern. Many frameworks are based on this pattern which is why its so useful to know.Certificates? Dont need em. Just get some experience.As for where to look for jobs. That all depends on how you want to go about getting started. You mentioned you want to start doing freelance. I didnt get started that way so please take what I say with a grain of salt. I have a feeling that freelance would be easier to get into than full time at least when you are first starting. The advantage you have is you can be a bit more selective where as when I started out in the industry I was going for full time positions with no prior experience so I had no bargaining power. As a result my first few gigs were pretty crappy. For freelance though you could do work for a friend a colleague as long as you get the job done and have work to show for it. Keep all work you do so you can continue to add to a portfolio. Heres a tip that I wish someone told me years ago when you finish a project take screen shots of it or whatever means you need to use to record its current state so that you have something to show off later in case the site suddenly disappears of changes so drastically that any evidence of your work on it is practically gone. Build up that portfolio. Once youve got some momentum going it gets much easier to find work.Another thing you can do and I know some people groan at hearing this but create a LinkedIn profile and fill it with whatever youve got but keep it focused to the industry you are targeting. It was one of the best things I had ever done career wise. After a while I didnt have to hunt for jobs because the head hunters started coming to me.Books! These are the books Ive found most helpful to me JavaScript The Good Parts  Douglas Crockford This book is essential to getting to grips with JavaScript. JS was a language that was slapped together pretty hastily when it was created and as a result there are some elements to the language that are better left unused. This books helps guide you through this learning process so you can avoid common traps. Secrets of the JavaScript Ninjas  John Resig Once you are better with JavaScript this book will take you to the next level. Its written by the creator of jQuery and is full of advanced techniques. This book gave me so many aHA! moments I couldnt put it down. CSS Mastery  Andy Budd This book is a bit dated. Latest version is about  years old so it wont contain many of the new features introduced to CSS with the CSS spec but its good place to start when learning CSS because it contains many of the bedrock techniques that are tried and tested. Once you get through this book moving on to more CSS topics will be trivial. Head First Design Patterns  Eric amp Elizabeth Freeman The book so good I accidentally bought two copies of it!

A rapid prototype is something that feels like an app but the background functionality doesnt exist. Ill put the prototype into many potential consumers hands to get feedback.

The same goes for if they express interest in using the app Ill literally say Im glad you seem interested in using the app although Im not fully convinced you actually want to use it so please tell me why?

I think it helps to know that no one wants to yell at you or make you feel bad and the only reason they do it is because they think you dont understand the seriousness of what you did or wont try to learn from the situation.So  is to remember that whatever people are saying to you they almost certainly dont mean it to the degree they are attempting to convey it as  they just think youre so dumb having fucked up that they need to be hyperbolic for you to understand. So dont take it personally. is equally important. You need to accept that you fucked up and there really are no excuses for fucking up. You should absolutely not defend yourself unless youre on trial you need to take your punishment and move on. Rather than defending yourself you need to talk about what youve learned that you should do differently. Dont bring up mitigating circumstances except in context of how you should have handled them better. Dont say you didnt know something. If you want to be less emotional you need to move with the wave crashing against you not be the rock its crashing on.Lastly remember that fucking up is only a matter of time. Everyone fucks up. Everyone gets reamed for fucking up. It is a universal experience. But you can choose to learn from the experience and have it happen less often for you.,IWantToLearn,cnwyfsk,24,t5_2rjo5

The basic training starts with spending your time before falling asleep thinking of what you want to do while sleeping and try to hold to that thought while you sleep it takes practice but with enough time you can do wonderful things. Ive heard the master somnistatiques can do complex things like taking their dog for a walk while sleeping.S....,IWantToLearn,coyffgw,2,t5_2rjo5

Tune in really listen try to understand not just what they are talking about but why it is the subject they give attention to. I have found that when you do this it is VERY rare you find anyone boring. And when you are interested genuinely in what they want to talk about and what makes them tick they will never find you boring.

Other suggestions include freelance translation if you know another language well enough blogging although it takes a while to build a sizable audience and income audio transcription work such as scribie.com and music reviews at slicethepie.com I dont know what your income expectations are but assuming you have the time to pursue multiple sources of work you can combine these approaches and hopefully make more money than doing just one of these.The subs rbeermoney and rhitsworthturkingfor focus on sites that provide smaller sources of revenue but they may give you additional places to earn money online or ideas about other things you can pursue solely online. ,IWantToLearn,cpcvdha,5,t5_2rjo5

3386351,0,t3_2yyu3f,Ok there are a few ways you can approach this. First you need to create your assets. All the characters backgrounds objects etc. If you want a Disney look you can draw each asset by hand with pen and paper scan trace around it in illustrator or photoshop theres also ways to do the trace part automatically but its not always accurate and might make animation tricky later. Or you can create everything right from illustrator or photoshop but personally I find this usually results in a more abstract geometric style. Or you can just take or find photos and illustrations and adjust them to your needs. This will give you a sort of collage like effect like Monty Pythons flying circus. Then once you have your assets you can animate them in after effects flash or whatever program you want. Using this method you will only need to draw or create each character once but you will have to teach yourself how to use quite a bit of software if you go this route. Alternatively you can learn very little software but youll have to draw more. If you draw each frame by hand this will give you the most Disney look. Then you can take photos of each one and compile them all in a video editing software of your choice. You can also use cut out photos instead of drawing. Im leaving out a lot of stuff but thats sort of the jist of it. Feel free to ask questions! Source I went to a filmdesignart school where I learned a lot about different methods of animating but it wasnt my main focus. ,IWantToLearn,cpe9re9,5,t5_2rjo5

3624152,0,t3_31v5ts,One of the most useful tools in the world for self improvement is a pen and a piece of paper. Whenever you encounter something that has gone wrong stop and take the time to think about why  and WRITE IT DOWN. If you dont you will get caught in the same thought loops thinking only one or two relevant points over and over again. Lets say one of your friends is being a dick. You arent sure if you still want to hang out with him. You need to evaluate all the options. Draw a nice big table that has three columns and four rows. In the top row write option positives negatives. In the first column under option write what you could do about it option  talk to him about it option  cut him out of your life completely option  do nothing option  reduce contact  only see in larger groups. Now for each option write down all the positives and negatives in the appropriate grid square. Some will apply to more than one. Dont stop until you cant think of anything else. Hopefully then one of the options will be a clear winner. When doing this it helps to remember what you want out of life  lots of friends? Always to be honest above all else? To achieve lots of complex challenging goals? Earn lots of money? Be the smartest? Etc. knowing who you and what you want will help with your decision making. Dont worry if you dont know that! Start with what you do know! Make another grid  things I like  want things I dont like  want things I dont know what I want. Write it all down no matter how big or small. Getting it out on paper lets you see patterns and think of new things. Take your time to sit quietly and block out  mins if you can to do this when you arent tired or stressed and you will learn a lot about yourself. Also the first time you do this technique start with something simple like what to have for dinner or something  that way you can learn the technique so that when you have to use it it is instinctive.

You can type many books this way if you get them off Project Gutenberg.That aside typeracer is pretty decent especially if you like the competition aspect.

4639993,0,t3_3eikf7,Its going to be be hard as hell to draw with only a mouse. Youll really need a tablet if you dont want to torture yourself. Gimp and Krita are free. Gimp is similar to photoshop and Krita is closer to something like painter I guess. Try both to see what suits your needs better. Digital art is no different that traditional art. Learn drawing fundamentals traditionally for a while and save up a bit of cash for a tablet in the meantime. If you can draw on paper you can draw no problem on a computer. Use YouTube for everything. There are literally tens of thousands of tutorials out there. I suggest feng zhu for drawing tips and industry info. Also Jeff watts sinix Scott Roberson noah Bradley and Chris Oatly and Level Up. Firstly learn to draw the human figure practice every day from life and from photos. Figure drawing will improve your skills in pretty much every way from draftsmanship to measuring proportions it will even improve your painting and animation skills should you choose to go those routes. And also draw still life draw random objects around draw literally everything and  all the time. Most importantly learn from people who know what they wereare doing. Do master studies whenever you can. Find and old painting you like? Try to draw or paint it yourself. Again this will help you to improve rapidly. You WILL see improvement every time. There IS a correct way to learn art. And the masters have broken their backs trying to develop that correct way. So why bother struggling and killing yourself trying to learn it alone when you have thousands of years of tradition as well as modern artists to learn from. Tldr YouTube tutorials for how to draw learn to draw the human figure learn from the masters. They devoted thousands of hours to learning these things. Take advantage of that. Always carry a sketchbook. Learn to draw on paper its cheap as hell and you can save up for that tablet in the meantime. ,IWantToLearn,ctffslr,8,t5_2rjo5

How can I achieve that? Which versions are available how many people do I need?As youve said youve got that covered already. If not you might take a look at various other games and combine differend aspects of them.ampnbsp  PrototypeCreate basic prototypes out of paper. Use game pieces and pegs from other games. Maybe check out collectors stores for uncommon dice or build them on your own out of wood. If you really need to get a custom piece and cant create it at home consider D printing it.Dont expect it to be a final game yet. it doesnt have to be pretty. Main focus is on making the barebones play and testable.ampnbsp  Improve amp Iterateampnbsp Play a few rounds with many differend people. Make it a game to find ways to exploit the rules so you can close those loopholes. Try to play boring matches and learn how you can avoid those situations. If you improved everything you thought of let some people play it without giving them any more information or help than the manual. Will it still work? Did it? Good. If not iterate anew.Make sure you get as much feedback as possible and make the most awesome game youve ever played. See the game like others would and not like its your baby and cant be changed.ampnbsp  Reach outIf youre happy with the concept and your testers love it finalize your designs and contents. No more thin paper. Make it look professional. Its necessary to know the price tag. How much will it cost me to produce those items at most? that means what will I need to pay someone to create a single unitConsider different options Doing everything on your own or outsourcing everything to a local carpenter or whatever craftsman you need. Will it be cheaper to use a Chinese factory? Go to Alibaba and ask a few seller if they could do it and what it would cost you.Theres a lot of guesswork here without any more details but generally it will be cheaper if you can repurpose something that is already being produced. If you projected price it too high for customers to buy downsize as much as possible and consider cheaper ways of production. a Crowdfund itRead some background on how crowdfunding works and basic marketing. Make sure to create topnotch marketing material and a meaningful and professional video the latter especially on kickstarter. Tell a compelling story. Engange the users. Use clever stretch goals so people will go for the more expensive option and feel good about it. Give them credit the community is your employer so you depend on them.Choose a minimum goal that will get your game off the ground both financially and by spreading the word. Also get a strategy ready before your campaign goes live Who will you target and how? What are their main reasons to engage why should they care? What is in it for them?ampnbspc Licence it or get it publishedCheck for large publishers and try to find smaller publishers. Coldcall them and see what it would take. You will need to basically sell your whole concept to them also see notes and they wont care about your idea. They have tons themselves and probably get a lot all the year round. Try to see the world through their eyes and dont get disappointed if the first  publishers wont even give you  a reason for not liking it.ampnbspb Bootstrap itThis can either be a fallbackstrategy or your first choice. Depending on the expected cost you should most likely be able to afford producing a few copies yourself if not its way to expensive to sell to massmarket. Do it. Sell them one at a time. Maybe start with friends and family if they like it. Then move to a local owneroperated store.  Create local buzz and reinvest your revenue into creating more while also  increasing batch size to save money on a single unit. Internet is also a huge opportunity here. Setting up an online story with Shopify is really easy and even a simple onepage template will do in the beginning to test waters. Basically produce a few samples start selling and always reinvest. Dont expect to get off the ground without any effort tho you dont have a large marketing machinery running in the background but need to it yourself.ampnbsp Notes You might want to outsource everything you cant do satisfactoryly yourself. If you cant design hire a designer for the differend parts the box the logo etc. I assume its rather hard to get a publisher to use your idea and pay your for it if you cant provide an incentive like for example having a large following on social media already.  Give them reasons to choose you and your concept. Consider the market. Will there be enough people willing to buy it? Or does it feel exactly like something etablished? You want to have it mass produced so this point is a must. For doing so getting users feedback and constantly improving is even more important. Cant highlight enough how important professionalism is. There are tons of people with ideas for board games. Many will be worse than you that succeed i.e. get producedampnbspGod damn I said I wouldnt write a wall of text this time.

5079068,0,t3_3kjtc0,Well Im not a frequent entertainer but I am a very good guest and feel like Ive been able to discern what makes something work well without making things feel forced or awkward.Create a space!So youve got a new apartment create some pockets of interest for whatever youd like to do while entertaining guests.  A few friends for dinner?  Get a nice dining table and an adequate amount of chairs.  Just drinks and conversation?  Maybe a little bar cart or bar area and a few armchairs.  Netflix and chill?  Couch TV coffee table.  I know this sounds obvious but its like having the basic tools of the trade doesnt need to be fancy just prepared for people coming over.  Clean that space!Nobody wants to see your dingy bathroom with no soap or use your shower towel to dry their hands.  Clean your kitchen vacuum whatever.  Unless its just your bros and youre watching a game and even then keeping things tidy is just being a good host.Prep your space!You should always have a beverage to offer your guests.  Water and clean glasses some soft drinks some beers or a fully stocked bar if you want to go that far.Music always helps whatever fits the mood youre going for and it just helps break the silence when you need to go take care of something answer the door etc.  Having little points of interest scattered around whether its a stack of magazines or an art print or a record collection or something for your guests to mill about and look at can be decent small talk conversation starters.So now on to the actual entertaining.Option AInvite people over for something specific and fun!It can literally be anything.  Whatever you have in common with your friends.  Cult movie night a book club sports DampD drinking.  Make it a thing make it interactive make it a no pressure event.  That way people know what theyre getting into from the start.  Thats where having a space available for what you want to do comes in.  Nobody wants to hang out in an empty room on the floor watching Gremlins  on a laptop when theyve been invited over for movie night.Option BThe casual Hey youre all welcome back at my place afterwards!This is where keeping things tidy and being prepared come in handy.  If youve created an inviting space and youre able to offer hospitality to your guests then youre good to go.,IWantToLearn,cuy7x8k,17,t5_2rjo5

5296315,0,t3_3mjfsw,To be able to suck your own dick there are two obvious requirements having an adequate penis length and the ability to bend ones torso far enough to reach your dick. The length of ones penis is inborn a constant that we cannot change. Therefore I could only cover the part where you can improve on.To acquire the desired flexibility similar to gymnastics it is best to start practicing from an early age. However I assume that you are no longer young enough for this point to be relevant. As an adult your best bet is to not give up and practice bending your torso forward little by little every day. On the other hand instead of bending your torso forward to meet your dick some might find it easier to lie on your back and lift your pelvis and legs towards your face.This practice phase will take a long time before your can even touch your lips on the tip. The sad news is you will probably be thoroughly disappointed by the fact that it feels far from what you would expect. But having one more tool at your disposal other than your hands is a fine addition dont you think? Once you are good enough to reach all the way down you will just need to experiment and work out what you like best. Those tricks will apply to blow jobs as well so you are killing two birds with one stone.Final reminder dont try too hard I am not responsible if you break your spinal cord trying to suck your own dick.LoveJoeyEdit formatting,IWantToLearn,cvonyhk,2,t5_2rjo5

5522985,0,t3_3qqkdf,Definitely watercolors possibly ink on top in some places. Watercolors are in my opinion both the most difficult and easiest paints to start with. They are hard to control bleeding or adding too much water can make them unruly but you can also erase them using certain techniques. Look up basics of watercolor painting online and see what you can pick up. I would recommend always drawing your image lightly with pencil first and then layering watercolors layering is KEY in almost all painting. Stick with it and you will find yourself learning how to control the paint. Some Protips .keep a paper towel in one hand and frequently wash your brushes clean to avoid muddy colors.. Either tape your paper down or invest in some high quality watercolor paper to avoid buckling. Buy a few good thin paintbrushes for details and a few larger ones for base colors. Always begin with painting the largest area of the drawing i.e. the sky usually takes up the most space with one color so start there and then work your way to the tiniest of details.. For clean crisp lines you can try taping sections off which never works for me or be patient and wait for sections to dry before you layer more on top.Good luck OP!Ive been painting with watercolors and oils for  years  feel free to message me if you have more questions,IWantToLearn,cwhm05i,27,t5_2rjo5

5557359,0,t3_3r3p51,Youve made a couple of websites already and an app so do you have coding skills or were these designed in a WYSIWYG editor? I ask this because WYSIWYG software is unnecessary and takes away some power. All you need is a text editor preferably one that highlights and auto tabulates like TextMate for Mac or Notepad for Windows and software to create your assets. In your text editor you mark out your HTML or CSS and save the file as somefile.htm or somefile.css accordingly. You can preview your web project with server software like IIS Apache a XAMP stack PHP  or even Python. If you have Python installed issue the following in Terminal  Command Prompt in your project directory to set up a local web server    python m SimpleHTTPServer Point your browser to  and theres your web page. Your first page served from a server is typically index.htm index.html default.html or index.php depending on configuration. So your first HTML web page should be saved as index.htm. Otherwise youll get either nothing an error or a directory listing.It sounds like youre interested in frontend web design so I will address that rather than web development. Before designing a website you should understand the structure of HTML documents. If you werent aware already HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. The current standard is HTML so you should learn this and its related DOM Document Object Model. HTML and DOM outline the structure of a web page.You can wireframe your website with Pen amp Paper a Graphics Tablet InDesign Fireworks Photoshop Diagram Software Online Tools or even in hashed out code. Honestly it doesnt matter. I tend to prefer pen and paper or hashed out code. What I mean by hashed out code is HTML written to divide the sections of a web page. Thats what HTML is for anyway structure! Keep this in mind whenever designing a website.Next you should learn CSS Cascading Style Sheet. CSS is for the presentation of your website. So HTML for structure and CSS for presentation. HTML itself is fairly easy to learn but its important for design that you understand a web pages structure. That being said CSS is where youll spend making your site beautiful with your design. CSS is also responsible for responsive layouts that conform to different sizes of windows whether on the desktop or mobile device. You too should learn the principles of responsive layout design. There are other kinds of layouts like fixed and fluid and various things in between but get into the habit of responsive design. Thats where the future of the web is at. Beware of CSS compatibility between different browsers.Rasters and vector drawing assets are created from other software. Although vector drawings can be coded in the XML based SVG parlance its nonsensical unless your drawing is very simiple. Anyways you use these as part of your design in a website which are placed there with CSS. Although not necessary they can add something unique to your website which would be difficult to do in CSS alone otherwise.Avoid using Flash assets as a design element for your website. Its vendorspecific not futureproof load heavy and many people prefer to disable Flash for various reasons.Additionally you may be interested in creating your own Font assets. Although there are many fonts already available namely font stacks that utilizes the systems available fonts or fonts from font squirrel  google fonts you can define your own fonts in CSS with fontface. fontface both names your font as well as points to the url of your font asset. Some people render fonts with JavaScript e.g. Cufn and have a fallback when JavaScript is disabled. This method has mostly been surpassed by fontface. You can create your fonts in TTF OTF WOFF or even SVG. I wont go over how each of these are made or advantages and disadvantages.So your design flow would be something like thisWireframe on paper gt Organize wireframe sections with HTML markup gt Fill in textual and tabular content gt Design static prototype with InDesign gt Create raster assets in Photoshop gt Create vector assets in Illustrator gt Position and size HTML sections with CSS according to InDesign prototype gt Color sections and choose fonts  formatting with CSS according to InDesign prototype gt Add assets to your project and place with CSS according to InDesign prototype gt Get web developer to implement backend stuff like user registration and transaction processing.Some of those steps can be replaced moved removed repeated as well as have the chosen software changed. Its all up to you. Adobe is really great for graphic design though so I recommend that. You can just as easily use GIMP CorelDRAW InkScape or whatever though.UPDATE Wanted to let you know that you can design in a WYSIWYG editor like Dreamweaver but I cannot recommend for or against it. The last time I used Dreamweaver it left a bunch of generated junk markup in the file. That was a long time ago though and it may be better now. Especially since Adobe took control. Also for purely HTML and CSS you can simply open the files in your browser. Setting up a server isnt strictly necessary but I wanted to at least mention it. Also if you dont have textual content yet you can generate dummy text with a Lorem Ipsum generator as a placeholder for future content. Remember HTML is for structure. So no using old world tags like ltbgt. Heres a simple boilerplate for your HTML document    lt!DOCTYPE htmlgt    lthtmlgt    ltheadgt        ltmeta charsetutf gt        lttitlegtExample Pagelttitlegt    ltheadgt    ltbodygt        lt!

5660273,0,t3_3sg2cf,Ive been teaching myself guitar for the past five or six years now and I owe A LOT to Ultimate Guitar. They have a massive number of tabs tablature an amateurfriendly and computerfriendly way to write and read music and lessons as well! I was really into punk music in high school and that influenced a lot of what I learned at first when I bought a cheap electric guitar. Power chords are easy and only require two to three fingers per chord so I didnt feel stressed about not being able to get all the strings required by the dreaded F major.YouTube is your best friend too. There are so many people teaching how to play certain songs or styles but honestly the best way to learn guitar is to learn the songs you actually enjoy! Learn to read tabs and the proper way to hold a guitar neck and how you should place your fingers it wont take long and every beginner video or tutorial will show you how!

Specifically draw character turnarounds Google it to find a style you like so that you have something to look back to. Also find a facial expression worksheet.

6014661,0,t3_3xue1w,One of the hardest things is the biting point. Sit in the car handbrake on put it into first and slowly release the clutch. Feel for the point when the car begins to lurch forward almost just as it leans into it and then depress the clutch again. That point of lurching is the biting point. get familiar with where it is before moving on.Next take it out of gear and into neutral. Rev the engine in neutral just to learn how hard to press the accelerator. Youre only looking for the car to build up a couple hundred revs from idle so dont be too enthusiastic. Id say  revs would be plenty. You want to see how hard youve to press to hold her at that not just to jump to it and then bail.Next combine the two. With the handbrake still on depress the clutch. Put her into first and bring the revs up. Slowly release the clutch until you feel the lurch and back down on the clutch again. Once youre comfortable with all that you can start driving. Note that up until this point the car hasnt moved at all. Do the last point except once you feel the lurch release the handbrake holding everything else as is and the car should move forward. If you jump forward you came off the clutch too much too fast. If you dont move youre not off the clutch enough. If you cut out you dont have enough revs built up.A thing that took me ages to learn is that when you set off just hold the clutch where it is for a second before releasing fully. I spent ages doing whiplashinducing starts because I didnt realise this. ,IWantToLearn,cy81skd,28,t5_2rjo5

Do you maybe want to become an econometrician psychometrician data scientist or a bioinformatics practitioner? If you are looking to sharpen your statistical intuition within an applied field your approach should be different to if you want to become a professional statistician.At my university students who wish to obtain a BSc with a major in statistics are required to take a the first three semester courses in calculus and the first two semester courses in linear algebra along with their statistics courses.The statistics courses for first year include  intro probability and descriptive statistics  Intro to statistical inference and  intro to distribution theory.Second year statistics courses include  applied statistics with statistical software  Statistical inference II  distribution theory II and  Forecasting Third year statistics courses include  Applied statistics with one way ANOVA mixed models and simple and multiple linear regression  Statistical inference III  Distribution theory III  Time series  Sampling Techniques and  Mathematical techniques in Statistics with calculus and matrix algebra applied to statistical calculationsFourth year includes  Matrix methods in Statistics  Multivariate Distribution Theory  Linear models  Regression  Advanced research methods in Statistics  a research project in statistics and then students have to choose three of the following a time series b survival analysis c nonparametric regression d methods of multivariate analysis e probability and stochastic processes f inference.That gives you an idea of the main topics in the field.

If your bed  breaks you can move your mattress onto the floor or sleep on a couch. If your toilet or sink breaks you can use a different one. If your garage door breaks you can park outside. The key here is realizing that the problem isnt really as big of a deal as you are making it out to be instinctively. Im sure you have gone through much greater hardship than having to deal with such problems at other points in your life and have been fine. Remember this.Second I would advocate trying to be solution oriented. Instead of focusing on the emotional reaction to the problem try to direct your attention towards how you will fix the problem.

As for blending social camouflage is all about not being noticed as opposed to asocial camouflage which is about not being seen.  The two may sound similar but they are quite different.Blending is all about noticing and emulating what the locals are doing whoever they are.  There is no magic trick to it no universal hat you can carry around to put on and disappear into a crowd.  rmalefashionadvice has some good advice you just need to flip it around.  Rather than avoiding black slacks and buttonup shirts to avoid looking like a waiter you wear them specifically to look like a waiter.  Its  not all about black however black is actually a really horrible colour for sneaking around in because it gives a very hard silhouette but that is more the territory of asocial camouflage.There are a lot of little details of fashion that people may not even be conscious of but will notice which in turn affects how they perceive you.Clothing is just one part of blending another part perhaps the most important part is body language.  There are various decent books out there but nothing beats just going to a mall and people watching.  Chances are you know more about people than you think youve just never had to use the information for anything so it just gets filtered out.  Its part of why some people boast they can always spot undercover cops because there is an identifiable Cop stance that they stand in.  Likewise you can often spot who skis and who snowboards based on how they stand and who spends a lot of time at a desk and who is a dancer.Then the trick for blending is emulating those things the slight little differences and suddenly nobody notices you because youre slouched and trudging rather than striding and looking down at your feet rather than constantly glancing around.  Or alternatively suddenly everyone notices you because youre standing tall with shoulders back and stomach in looking around and making eye contact with people.If you ever want to make an adventure of it come to Violence Dynamics and do a mall walk.  It is an amazingly valuable experience.As for lockpicking I cant offer much there.  There are no real legal options for me to practice it here as even possession of picks is considered criminal intent.Ive got nothing to offer on passports either.,IWantToLearn,d0ebgxn,2,t5_2rjo5

Even if you dont follow completely the excersise is useful and youll learn some useful tricks along the way.The most important thing is that you digest the ideas properly. You have to think about what youve read or watched. So after each learning session enter your favourite meditative space. Some people like to just sit in a quiet place others like to have music some cycle or run. For me its walking. Go for a walk and try to rerun the lecture in your head. Take a few problems with you and try to solve them without paper. Create your own problems to solve as you walk. If you have a poor memory take a notepad. Jot down insights. Try to find a way to visualize the problems.Then you have to put into practice what youve learned. Do excersises and finnish them! Do the optional excersises at the end of the section these will test your understanding of the theory.As you progress youll be building on the theory youve learned previously.

When applying the brakes be fully seated on the bicycle.       . Turning is very subtle. If you turn the bars quickly left or right the bike will change direction but your momentum will continue forward and thats never fun. To fix this problem turning is achieved by shifting your weight slightly left or right. This can be achieved by leaning slightly in either direction or by putting extra weight on either side of the handlebars left or right. ,IWantToLearn,d2lj2gq,1,t5_2rjo5

Sorry if some are obvious. I dont know your current skill level.  know your subject. Very. Painstakingly. Thoroughly.  dont drink caffeine sleep well and eat well if you have slides use them as talking points instead of reading word for word. Dont even put words on them slides when you can avoid it.  always have a backup for presenting your content scan several places to look in the audience. Look around every  seconds in a different direction to concentrate on different people.  have water available stand up straightmove around a bit and using your hands is ok speak slowly and clearly project even with a mic. They can turn down the volumetric needed.  dont try to get a joke in there if youre new to speaking. Dry is better than unfunny do things to bring people back. Like a break questions slide audience participation change the pace of your speech pitch and tone of your voice. Say or do something dramatic. Pose a problem cliffhanger and later give its solution. The natural tendency of the audience member is to drift in attention.  dont say um err uh... Etc.  listen to recordings of yourself and get a sense of what weird speaking mannerisms and bad habits you have. Practice to correct them.  try to get up on stage before the audience fills in so that you have a sense of what the view is like. Where the promoter is. Where lights are. Where to stand. How to plug in your equipment. Etc.  practice at least one hour for every  minutes of delivery if you get stage freight or forget your material know that long pauses are actually not that bad. Just dont spaz out. Keep cool. golden rule of presenting  tell them what youre about to tell them.  tell them.  tell them what you just told them. in general less is more. Especially true if youre long winded like me.  arguably my favorite tip watch presentations and speeches from orators you like. Personally I like the style of Steve Jobs even if its a bit clich. And note what they do well. you simply cant learn to speak without having delivered a speech. Its not possible. You will bomb a couple times. You will have things go wrong. You will get better with time and practice. ,IWantToLearn,d3n621v,1,t5_2rjo5

The more time you put into learning the stock market and learning about how each individual company works the better chance you have at not losing money. As far as links towards resources definitely check out Martin Shkrelis Youtube lectures on investing and finance. He comes off as a pretentious asshat but hes a very smart guy who knows what hes talking about. Also look at the rpersonalfinance wiki on investing and the rinvesting wiki Start reading up on fundamental analysis and read some of the books recommended in the sidebar of rinvesting.

This way he has no backup and you still have the leverage on him as noone else knows about the dirt.Step . Now you are free to roast them as hard as you possibly can in every situation your leverage will keep them from counterroasting you.Step .

7885359,0,t3_4n9bwm,I got my start doing repairs by watching youtube videos. most things you can just type change head gasket ltcar and yeargt and there will be some video guiding you though it. after a while you get the intuition to just do it yourself.also it doesnt hurt to watch general car shows mighty car mods Doug bernards his videos are cringy but he does good fabrication work and other similar channels.as far as painting goes the process starts by stripping back all the paint you dont want on the car then priming. after you sand smooth i go with  grit but most of what i paint isnt car sized... next hit it with a few coats of paint... and sand smooth again. get some oil removing wipes and wipe down the paint after its dry. now comes the clear coat which is the thing that really makes the finish. start layering on the clear you want good air exchange as it will help remove orange peeling which makes your life easier. i forget the preferred air exchange rate but thats searchable on google. once your clear coat is dry start sanding. i start at  and work up to around . dont karate kid wax on wax off. instead go in back and fourth motions all going the same direction. each grit change swap the direction your going  degrees... so from up and down to side to side and then back again. the paint should get more and more dull the higher the grit you are sanding with scratches getting less and less noticeable. before you started sanding theres gonna be little peaks which are more shiny. this makes a textured pattern. thats orange peel. you dont want any of that left preferably by the time you reach  grit.  once done get a buffing wheel  random orbital buffer and use a wool bonnet. microfiber isnt good at cutting like wool is. get some rubbing compound and put it on the bonnet. too much and it wont work right but more gt less. i always load up on the bonnet and the part until the bonnet is damp with the paste evenly then just work it over the area of the part til its thin enough to work right. keep doing this you should now start to see your paint getting shiny. not quite done yet... next up you need swirl remover repeat the process with a new wool bonnet now. after your done you can go to your standard car care products. i use a polishing cream on a microfiber bonnet followed by wax.if you have any cuts or scrapes that go into the metal its the same process but after you strip the paint you body filler the area and sand... keep applying your filler and sanding til it looks smooth. once done then prime it. look hard at it after the primer dries and use a flashlight at different angles. any small defect will be super noticeable in the paint. its common to prime notice something sand more and prime again multiple times until you get it right. doing all this seems like a lot of work but the paint looks like its dripping wet. WAY better than any factory finish.,IWantToLearn,d42dy4o,1,t5_2rjo5

8056916,0,t3_4pjsav,Toolsthere are  main tools that are routinely used for data analysis the first step would be to gain a passing or better familiarity with them. excel this is a tool which is important at almost all levels a lot of times you end up exporting your data into excel at the end of an analysis session. Most people know how to do basic formulas like calculating the average of a row or something like that but it can become an extremely powerful tool when you learn how to use the functions countifvlookupindexmatch pivot tables...etc such tools are bread and butter analytical tactics that everyone that routinely works with data should know. there are many tutorials online for learning this type of stuff i have no specific recommendations. database language SQL this isnt really a full on programming language but is extremely important to most enterpriselevel database data management. These are generally pretty easy to learn the real trouble comes when you start dealing with messy data. you can again find tutorials online i got hired for a data analysis position based off of simply doing the codeacademy learn SQL tutorial I had good credentials but i passed the SQL interview test specifically with knowledge from there R this is another huge data analysis tool usually its not used so much as a programming language but more as a big calculator with a ton of libraries. Do you want to try to look at the clustering for your  rows of data? R has you covered. R in general is quite fast and the learning curve comes with trying to learn how to use the specific libraries. A good intro point would be to download Rstudio and look at the reshape library tutorial here  Python this is becoming more and more relevant as big companies start utilizing python more and more. Im not so proficient at this i mostly used the other .ConceptsIn order to be successful in data analysis you obviously will be drawing heavily from the field of stats. things like linearlogistic regression spectral analysis clustering CART are bread and butter concepts that you probably want to look up.Learningi took this classwhich recommends  good text booksif it were me id do the SQL and R tutorials and then start looking at the textbooks which id probably get with genlib.Ive heard good things about a free harvard data science course but i cant vouch for its quality myself.good luck let me know if you have questions.,IWantToLearn,d4lo8zr,23,t5_2rjo5

For example right now Im taking Harvards CSx EDX online course to get myself started. My aim is to make an app which I can then hopefully monetize. In terms of difficulty think of this as learning to read or write a completely new language that youve never heard of.Next option could be blogging. Its a pretty huge area. If you do anything interesting in your life even if its on the internet rather than IRL then you can probably maintain a blog about it. Could be anything from gaming to professional advice. The tough part here is actually have some kind of niche in your life. Whatever you blog about has to be interesting somehow.A far out thought is investing in stocks but its probably the riskiest way to go and Im not too sure about how you really enter that world. I do know you can do it all online though through discount brokers and the like.

You would need to hire someone or find a good artist friend to do it for you. Its been a while but I believe my research showed that it would be something like  per page for a semiprofessional to professional quality artist or more depending on the prominence of the artist. Once you got that you can start trying to catch the attention of one of the companies.On a more helpful note you can check out the software CeltX It is primarily for writing scripts but I believe they have a comic template. It was very helpful for me.Getting a big dry erase board is a good idea too. I liked to layout each page with panels dialogue and stick figures since I cant draw for shit on there to help me visualize it before putting it in the script. Pacing the panels and limiting dialogue was one of the biggest challenges I found going from someone who wrote a lot of short stories and prose. I never realized how important panel layout affected me as a reader until I was working on writing my own comic.,IWantToLearn,d6iz24e,7,t5_2rjo5

9557271,0,t3_5bs6pr,Theres a sub called Change my View. It prides itself on holding logical arguments above name calling and weak emotional appeals. All the people that comment there are usually really good at constructing arguments and convincing people of their opinion. The one good thing about the sub is that mostly an argument will be upvoted if its good regardless of what the argument is actually saying. So in otherwords if you can present a good argument as to why hilter was right it will be upvoted. Okay maybe thats a bit of a stretch but you get the idea. The point is you wont become persuasive by reading a book. You need experience. Go there and comment. A LOT. Be determined because chances are your arguments will get torn apart every time. But stick with it and try to learn why your argument was bad and what you could have done to make it stronger.Do that a few times a weak for  months and you will most definitely see an improvement in your persuasive abilities.  ,IWantToLearn,d9r4ou4,8,t5_2rjo5

9632421,0,t1_da0dcap,Continuous airflow the tongue is just changing the resonant space in your mouth while you whistle.  As if you are blowing over the top of a water bottle to make a pitch while the amount if water is rising and falling. Perhaps it would help if you chose a pitch in the middle of your whistle range something that you feel is the easiest and most solid whistle you can make.  Try to incorporate vibrato in on only that pitch because different pitches will require slightly modified technique.  For example lower pitches require more tongue movement to attain a similar shift in pitch than higher pitches.Since the space in your mouth will be fluctuating focusing on the middle of your range will give you wider margins to work with without having to modify your lips to create higher or lower pitches.  Hopefully that makes some sense.I am happy to help! Trying to break down the process into well defined digestible steps helps me teach others better in the future!Still it is difficult teaching through text only since there may be some other part of your technique that is causing a problem which I cannot realize.  How would you rate your tone? Can you achieve a pure whistle tone or is it always airy? Can you describe how you use your mouth to whistle?

Its a very poor form of therapy and instant gratification that some people use instead of drinking and drugs. She may be depressed and getting a good deal or finding something neat gives her a shot of dopamine makes her feel good. If shes collecting heaps of stuff that she never even uses piles of things that still have the sales tags on them she may have a problem.

9872384,0,t3_5gk0to,If you have a strong and serious desire to do this this might help.More than two decades ago I learned a teaching method called Programmed Instruction. I experimented with it and ended up refining it to what I describe below. I used a computer but this can be done with cards too. Ive also done this with a PDF file in a Kindle.My objective was to teach a math or physics concept only using the cards or frames in a computer like in a PowerPoint presentation. I wanted to know how much my students could learn without my direct assistance.Each card asked the student to write or do something related to the concept they were learning. There were no readonly cards. There were no noninteractive instructions like Read the next card nor insubstantial questions like Do you understand? YesNo.I also had this rule No card will have more than  words including the answer.The objective is to try to be as clear as possible and to advance at a student pace not at a teacher pace and use small groups of pupils say of ten pupils each as focus groups.You build an ordered stack of cards. And just like flashcards each card will have the correct answer behind it.Watch each student while they use your stack. Dont teach them yourself. Let the cards do it instead.If  of the ten kids got stuck at Card  or gave a wrong answer in Card  then youll know exactly where you need to make your explanations clearer.Correct your stack and try it with another focus group. Dont try them with previous focus groups because you want a stack that teaches pupils who have never heard of this new math or physics concept.I found out that its hard to teach like this. Its also very humbling. And its also quite fun.By doing this for several years and without planning it intentionally I learned how to be a lot clearer in my explanations when I instruct students oneonone or in a classroom.Youll know youre doing it right when you try your stack with  students and they get all the answers right without your direct help.Also when you get spontaneous feedback from your students like Can I do this stack again? They should teach like this at my school.Hope this helps your students as much as it helped mine.,IWantToLearn,daue8h9,1,t5_2rjo5

10802531,0,t3_5uerhs,Some very good advice on here already but Ill give a simple tidbit I learned on my first sales job that made things much easier.Why? What? When? Where?Those questions are key to making a sale and creating repeat customers. Youre selling jewelry so its about having someone make a purchase during the course of an experience leaving them with a feeling of satisfaction. The only way you can deliver that is by asking those questions and genuinely listening to the answer and applying it.So if someone walks in you need to find out why they came in. Lets say they mention theyre looking for something for their wifes birthday. What did they have in mind? That narrows it down to either earrings a bracelet a necklace or something else. When did they first meetget married. This will help you understand the depth of their relationship. Where did they first meet or currently live can help jog some nice memories easing the customer a bit. Along with these questions I was also taught that often times youre looking for the third answer they give as the first two are generally coming through a cloud of privacy. What did you have in mind?Something nice but not too expensive.Anything item in particular that you were considering?Probably a necklace.Were you thinking gold or silver?Probably like a white gold.Boom! You just narrowed down his search from your entire store to basically one display case. You asked simple questions that dont necessarily pry but help ease the process along.Next thing you both know hes chosen his piece youve rung him up and he happy the entire thing took less than  minutes. ,IWantToLearn,ddu7dq4,2,t5_2rjo5

I practiced on my right hand for months and now I can only on my right hand Im learning the left.Working out is great. You dont need to go to a gym if you are starting out body weight can be used as resistance and you will learn a lot about your body.When you communicate with people how do you do it? Are you assessing their emotional situation and bending to conversation to be more warm to them? Can strong emotions take control of an argument and degrade the conversation? There are books available about the basic fundamentals of communication Ill admit I was fully ignorant on all of this I have much to learn. Most importantly think about what you like. I love to learn so watching documentaries reading or watching youtube videos can be rewarding if they are knowledgefocused. You are the arbiter of your life. You know what is enjoyable. By exploring your emotional feelings to reality you can create rewarding experiences.This all sounds hokey but truly understand that you have full control of your life. What do you want regardless of how ludicrous it is? Write a delusional list of desires e.g. Richest person in the world First person to land on Mars Venus and Jupiter. Jupiter is a gas giant that may not have a solid core? Fuck that  you want to land on it. No one can deny your dreams but many will attack them.
