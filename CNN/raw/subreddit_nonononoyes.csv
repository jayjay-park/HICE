90098,0,t1_ceooars,Whats funny is I gave a breakdown in my original post. Here it is again.. Dont put baby carriers in carts like that. In fact most carts have a warning on them now saying to not do it. its not safe the carrier is unbalanced a little wobbling and bam its off. More obviously it put a lot of weight on the front end of the cart which is already the heavy side meaning the cart could flip backwards as well its just a bad idea and more so its a well documented bad idea.. The kid wasnt fucking strapped in...... I mean seriously? Its recommended that you leave the child strapped into a carrier like that at all times. . Babies that young make a lot of noise when they are moving about its a big struggle for little kids to wiggle like that lots of grunting etc. So yeah... as a parent since I dont expect people without kids to know shit about child carriers I do have specific knowledge that tells me that that parent was being a fucking dolt.

Whats anything times zero?This isnt to say that it wouldnt hurt to get hit by a train moving at that speed but its independent of its mass if its velocity is constant. What isnt constant is the persons acceleration. The persons mass is being accelerated from rest to a velocity equal to the trains in a very small time frame.

2148160,0,t1_clct88k,Typically common climbing routes have bolted hangars at the top of the climb.  A rope is strung to these bolts with the climber on one end and a belayer on the ground on another end.  As the climber climbs the belayer is pulling the slack in the rope.  In the event of a fall the climber doesnt fall much as the belayer is holding the climber via rope in the style of a pulley.In trad climbing no such hangar exists to be used as a safety mechanism or the route is too long to climb in that manner. Here the lead climber uses spring loaded cams that are inserted into deep cracks in the rock that act as a temporary hangar that the rope is then attached to.  People climb a couple of feet insert a cam then climb a bit more.  The longer the distance between inserting cams the longer the potential fall until the rope.  Its also more dangerous as the more one falls the larger the force that acts upon the cam is which could cause the cam to fall out.,nonononoyes,clcvowj,14,t5_2xp2p

I think they are pissed that the car in front of them is going so slow. This is sped up in the original footage you can see they are probably going high s. The car in front of them is going around half of that which means he is most likely going way slower than he should be. They are pissed because normally a car would be going close to their speed and would not put them in that situation. Although they are still idiots for doing this when the road is that crowded and I am not trying to blame the driver at all.There are tons of videos are youtube of longboarders doing nearly this same thing.  Obviously its stupid and dangerous but you would be surprised how much control a good longboarder has. There is a reason you dont hear about people dying from stuff like this often if at all.

They took him to the emergency room and shaved his head and gave him several stitches but otherwise he was okay. I felt absolutely horrible even though it really wasnt my fault. Another time me and some friends were playing with a plastic boomerang and I slung it and noticed on its return path it looked like it might hit my friend that was about  yards in front of me.

If you cant make sure you appear confident and large. Make sure the bear knows youre there but dont antagonize it.

Continue to appear large and confident and calmly leave. Yell only if it starts coming your way. Keep an eye on it at all times whether youre really close to them or not.The easiest thing to do is just avoid them.

I have read a case where the driver was not guilty because the officer did not testify that there were any other cars let along any cars affected by the turn.And dont take my word for this but I cant see any section of the HTA that requires you to signal a lane change... which surprises me.,nonononoyes,cwevwth,1,t5_2xp2p

5557529,0,t1_cwlwpml,The reason bikes need to be ridden as vehicles is pretty much this gif. When riding a bike on a sidewalk or through a crossing the physical space the person is occupying is larger than if they were walking if a car zooms up on you you cant hop backwards or to the side or make any kind of move to get out of the way other than go forward. Next time you are driving or walking on a sidewalk notice where drivers stop their car when coming out of a parking lot onto the road they stop over the sidewalk with the nose of the car near the road. When a bike or moped or skateboarder is on a sidewalk  approaching a driveway and a car is in that drive approaching the road neither really expects the other. And if a car nudges a rider even at  mph or under if they just nudge the rider then the rider could fall into the road where highspeed traffic is going.In this gif it looks like neither the biker nor the car have their eyes on the road the car did pretty good despite that.

Its not out of the question though but sometimes its just not something you can adjust for.My point however is to not just assume that This person clearly knows when to stop merging so I wont take any action against it. If you can do something about it why not take the extra precaution? Its entirely doable if youre diligent.I was taught that if you can eliminate risk then you should do so. Dont tailgate in case people slam on the brakes. Dont speed because you might be caught offguard and be unable to stop it. Dont merge without looking or signaling because someone else might not see you coming. Im just fortunate enough to not have been rearended yet with how often people tailgate others while driving.gtDo you run red lights because you believe the cars behind you wont stop? Do you stop at every green light because you expect the driver in the opposing left lane to just start turning in front of you?If you want to use these specific examples then okay. I dont run red lights however Ill always keep an eye on my rearview mirror to see if someones about to plow into me from behind. Theres not much to do in that situation without endangering other people so unfortunately Ill just have to hope I dont get killed that way. I dont stop at green lights all the time however there has been a few cases where someone decided to in fact start turning right in front of me and I at least slowed down a bit in response to avoid ramming into them.Does what Im saying make sense? Being aware of whats going on and driving defensively is insanely important in my opinion. I was afraid of driving for a very long time because of how I saw other people drive. What I am not saying is to drive dangerously in the name of avoiding an accident. What Im saying is to learn how to adapt to the road and be aware of whats happening around you while assuming people will not be doing you the same favor.,nonononoyes,cx4ocbp,1,t5_2xp2p

5883590,0,t3_3vtft4,So I was bored last night and started surfing around Youtube for mindless shit to watch.  I came across a video from Syria showing HD footage of the war.  So I searched syria fighting and there is a shit ton of new HD footage of that shit.  God fucking damn the soldiers are about as well trained as a bag of hammers but when you have big ass guns even poorly trained fighters can wreak death and destruction.  The odd thing to my western mind is HOW MUCH they yell Allahu Akbar!  Prepping to fire an anti tank round?  One guy yells  Allahu Akbar! then the rest do as well.  he fires off his round and a dozens guys once again yell Allahu Akbar!.  Over and over again and again they yell Allahu Akbar!.   War footage can be strikingly moving as it is in a negative way of course.  Add to that the fighters yelling God Is Great! before every move after every weapon firing  makes it that much more frightening and sinister.  To these guys the death and destruction theyre carrying out is ordained by a power that made and controls the entire universe.  ,nonononoyes,cxqvecf,208,t5_2xp2p

5910344,0,t1_cxubu4c,Yes as a Pistons fan this is rnonononono material. Ersan Ilyasova caught the rebound and couldve just stood there to run out the clock or get fouled. Instead he tried a flailing putback that wouldve made it a point lead and likely out of reach for Memphis. But standing there getting fouled or kicking it back out to a guard wouldve all been better decisions to close the game out. EDIT After rewatching the video Ily had to put it up because Morriss initial shot didnt hit rim. So the shot clock was winding down and it was just chaos trying to get the ball up on the rim to avoid the shot clock violation. After Ily put it up it came off the rim and Drummond tried for the tip but it doesnt look like he couldve come down with a clean rebound so I dont fault either of them. It really just came down to a terribly unlucky series of events for the Pistons. ,nonononoyes,cxudngo,4,t5_2xp2p

I guess the stream was bigger at some point and nobody bothered to take the bridge down when urban sprawl caught up with the area.  Anyways wed stand in the middle and jump up and down to make the entire thing including the towers sway back and forth.

There are cars and bikes coming every which way in an intersection of about ten streets. This picture on streetview doesnt do it justice. There were constant streams of vehicles when i went and these incredibly long pedestrian crossings you couldnt hope to get through even if there were pedestrian lights and drivers obeyed traffic signals.You just have to be predictable and not stop. If you stop its really hard to get going because vehicles treat you as an object travelling on a vector at a fixed velocity. Your velocity is now zero which means theyre going to be passing only a metre in front of you until youre lucky enough to see a small enough gap you can start moving again. But just keep walking the same speed with an eye on the oncoming traffic and youre probably ok. I felt safe enough after the first couple of gos.,nonononoyes,d0hwc6r,1,t5_2xp2p

We keep doing this process of assigning num to the next value and running the loop until array of numbers has no more values.array of numbers is four s and one  so the end result of the loop is nonononoyes.This code is poorly written though.,nonononoyes,d21dxu3,12,t5_2xp2p

God forbid you ever feel like suicide is easier than dealing with a crippling physical ailment.   As a ridiculous side note when I was a kid and had not seen the word in print I thought euthanasia was Youth in Asia.  I never understood why they were so talked about so much.

7394454,0,t1_d2i9dzq,gtIve been at a point of prolonged mental anguish and depression and only withheld my desire to end my life because of how it would affect my family. Im in a much better place now and extremely grateful I never went further than contemplation. Mental suffering is not a reason to commit suicide. Its a reason to get help.Im torn on this bit but at least you mentioned prolonged because most people dont think about that part when someone mentions that people with mental issues should also be included when suicide is a viable option.  I dont think someone going through a really fucking awful point in their life should choose suicide legal or not but disorders I think are a different beast.Ive been dealing with depression for about  years now.  And about  years ago is when the mania onset and I had no idea what was happening until I was finally properly diagnosed years later.  Treatment has helped.  Some times are better than others but even with diligence I still find myself usually too late fucking up parts of my life again.  Theres no cure and Ill have to deal with this for the rest of my life.  Its exhausting.   Managing it and then trying to forgive myself after I inevitably slip up and am left looking at the debris is fucking exhausting and depressing.  Its not just prolonged its a life sentence.  And its still there even if Im in the best spot of my life.  Thats all really fucking hard to deal with at times.  Getting to just  has been mentally and emotionally devastating.  Its even harder when you feel like the only reason you keep pushing through all the torture is because you dont want to hurt the people who still love you.  Trapped.  Stuck in a perpetual cycle of depression and the occasional period of what feels like a speedy and productive anxiety attack that can last for days or weeks or god forbid months.My goal post is .  I think thats a good age to end it.  I have no idea if I can even make it that long but I totally get why some people think people with mental disorders should be included in legal suicide.  ,nonononoyes,d2ip8bc,2,t5_2xp2p

7513138,0,t1_d2w60tc,Well I didnt speak to whether it was selfish. But I guess I can now if someones doing something in the wilderness out of their depth that is selfish. Every time some bozo gets lost in the woods and a hundred man search and rescue squad has to assemble to save his dumb ass thats selfish.That said the selfishness of just falling off a cliff while riding your bike in a ridiculous way is a bit less selfish since its easier to just bag an easy to find body than search for someone slowly dying of exposure. But still someones gotta do the bagging. Someones gotta look at your mangled corpse pick it up put it in a bag and carry it however many miles to the car. And theyre probably making less than kyr to do it too.Then theres still the cost the people who care about you have to pay but hey maybe youve already managed to alienate everyone in your life so thats why you dont value that cost very highly.gt And how I enjoy my time on this planet is up to me and nobody else.I believe thats actually the definition of a selfish perspectivegt adj. Concerned chiefly or only with oneselfgt impose your moralityI should add that neither I nor the person above me who first mentioned selfishness said that selfishness necessarily implies immoral behavior. You made that connection yourself. Maybe if you think selfishness is immoral you should strive to live a life less guided by selfishness.That said my originally post had nothing to do with selfishness. I was originally just explaining how fundamentally subjective evaluations of a situation in which nearly everyone agrees cant just be swept aside by relativistic hand waving and subsequent pointing to the few exceptions that prove the rule.Finallygt die fulfilling my desires early than live a long safe life full of regrets and what ifsI have a hard time imaging how risking instant death for going over a twig slightly wrong is some profound experience that you just have to engage in to have a fulfilled life. Indeed the reason people say what theyre doing is stupid is because it isnt. Its just a cheap thrill no different than climbing without a rope or taunting a wild animal. If any of those two guys slipped and fell off the cliff their last thoughts will be oh fuck shouldntve rode so close to the edge that was dumb even if fun while it lasted and not Ive found peace and personal fulfillment in riding my bike on the edge of a cliff. ,nonononoyes,d2w7frx,3,t5_2xp2p

Now imagine doing that while youre balancing on a centimeter wide line with pieces of the bus often missing you by centimeters. Imagine the ground underneath you is shifting. It happens and youre scared and then you realize that if that mirror had been a centimeter closer it would have clipped your elbow and send you spiraling into nearby cars fast enough to liquefy your internal organs.This is why cyclists get angry when you dont obey the legal requirement to give ftm passing room.

But I do believe that its important for instance for people who believe  is the single most horrific thing to happen in history or for people who believe that all the innocent lives lost in US occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan and the ensuing conflict were far more important and devastating than  to be reminded that no innocent death is justified and that both events were devastating in their own ways. I mean one might be worse than the other but nobody can honestly know there are just too many contributing factors to be able to say. Anyhow the reason I mention all of this is because of all the terrorist attacks in this century  really was the most disturbing I think. It was so surreal so unexpected. And for four ? planes to be flown into some of the most important and famous buildings in America and the world in one day it was a huge and quite terrifying wake up call to how dangerous Al Qaeda and similar groups were it was like a sense of innocence and safety at home the world had was shattered that day. ,nonononoyes,dcha2gw,4,t5_2xp2p

10360264,0,t3_5obmvd,Hey! This is in Watsonville California! My uncle used to own it when it was called Watsonville Speedway. And my dad used to be the flag man! AKA this guys job hereI grew up on that racetrack and those fences have held back more than a sprint car. I used to stand on that flag stand and hand my dad the flags he was going to use next and once or twice he let me wave the finish flags. I remember that the drivers used to hate my dad sometimes because he was a real start stickler. He wanted everyone perfect before the start. Hearing the drivers rev their engines because they were annoyed always got the crowd riled up. And on nonrace days we would water the track with the water truck and hang out in the pits and center field. Before John Prentice bought it the track used to be a figure  for derby days. This track is one of the last  dirt tracks in California. I should check to see how the track handled this last storm. It probably flooded like it used to when I was a kid. We would have to pump the water out into the nearby pondEdit added stuffEdit I just messaged my uncle to see if he can send me some pictures! Edit Im trying to get pictures but no one is responding. I even tried texting my sister. I have proof of that! Edit I mean I guess I could name drop my uncles name is Rick Farren he is married to my dads sister Pam. My dads name is Pete Lewis and he stopped flagging in like late . I havent talked to my dad in a bit or I would send a picture of his old flags he has in his closet.Edit heres a picture of my dad! Hes the guy standing behind the guy with the flag. Probably switching out or training the guy for when my dad retired from flagging to work on his mechanic business.

10968296,0,t1_deb38i5,Part gtAs a former SR pilot and a professional keynote speaker the question Im most often asked is How fast would that SR fly? I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. Its an interesting question given the aircrafts proclivity for speed but there really isnt one number to give as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see  miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions and never wanted to harm the plane in any way we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus each SR pilot had his own individual high speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way and max power was in order. Lets just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadnt previously seen.gtSo it was with great surprise when at the end of one of my presentations someone asked What was the slowest you ever flew in the Blackbird? This was a first. After giving it some thought I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before and relayed the following.gtI was flying the SR out of RAF Mildenhall England with my backseater Walt Watson we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR flypast. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR perform a low approach. No problem we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea we proceeded to find the small airfield.gtWalter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower and I pulled the throttles back from the  knots we were at. With the gear up anything under  was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the fieldyet there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. part gtMeanwhile below the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the flypast. It was a quiet still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze I couldnt see it. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle the slower we got. With our power back the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career as something told me I better crosscheck the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below  knots my heart stopped and my adrenalinfilled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we werent really flying but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame and what a joyous feeling that was the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning they now had  feet of firebreathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated in full burner on the tower side of the infield closer than expected maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knifeedge pass. gtQuickly reaching the field boundary we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didnt say a word for those next  minutes. After landing our commander greeted us and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR flypast he had ever seen especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadets hats were blown off and the sight of the planform of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of breathtaking very well that morning and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.gtAs we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits we just sat therewe hadnt spoken a word since the pass. Finally Walter looked at me and said One hundred fiftysix knots. What did you see? Trying to find my voice I stammered One hundred fiftytwo. We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said Dont ever do that to me again! And I never did.gtA year later Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officers Club and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR flypast that he had seen one day. Of course by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said It was probably just a routine low approach theyre pretty impressive in that plane. Impressive indeed.gtLittle did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. Its ironic that people are interested in how slow the worlds fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed however its always a good idea to keep that crosscheck up...and keep your Mach up too. gtBrian Shul spent  years as an Air Force fighter pilot and now is a popular keynote speaker. Shot down in Vietnam he spent one year in a burn ward. His comeback story culminated with flying the SR which he detailed inSled Driver.

High speed oval racers like NASCAR have flaps on the roof that get forced up when the car goes sidewaysbackwards preventing the car from lifting up and flying like a frisbee out into the crowd. Even with those flaps going backwards is pretty dramatic Without roofflaps the cars dont spin as violently but fly far further The risk of that is that you spend longer out of control at high speed contact with inner walls more likely you fly further and higher crowd risk and you dont scrub off as much speed in the air.,nonononoyes,dff3lra,1,t5_2xp2p
