3287817,0,t3_2xpdwb,Interesting. My mom is starting the oral meds to prevent recurrence very soon but I didnt think to ask ifhow much insurance covers. Thus will likely mean she has to keep working for the next  years though she was planning on retiring. Edit a letter,breastcancer,cp31cuv,2,t5_2t6dy

My wife wouldnt mind participating and there are several other women who are in her local support group who would most likely help out too.  If youd like more participants please respond.,breastcancer,crud28i,1,t5_2t6dy
4608155,0,t3_3e3vyd,Sorry youre having to go through this. I had a lumpectomy in April and the one lymph node taken in the sentinel node biopsy was clear but cancer was found in the tissue surrounding the lymph node. As a result radiation to the lymph may be recommended when I finish chemo just started on Friday. In your moms case I imagine theyve already recommended radiation to the breast they may suggest it for the lymph nodes as well  and potentially chemo. I have a rare genetic disorder that makes me more likely to get radiationinduced cancers so I wont be doing radiation and will likely have to have a mastectomy after chemo. I havent decided yet what to do about my lymph nodes. ,breastcancer,ctbfwns,1,t5_2t6dy

Sorry to hear about Mum....Im recently diagnosed with breast cancer and I am the only one in my gene pool that has been diagnosed. My doctor is doing the genetic testing on me so I can tell my two grown girls whether or not they should be tested. Good luck to you!!!,breastcancer,cx4rqjh,2,t5_2t6dy
8030565,0,t3_4m7nx2,Dont google!! I second the opinion theres a lot of crap on the Internet. I was given  months  years ago. I currently have mets in my spine lungs and lymph nodes in my neck. According to Dr. Google Im toast.But someone has to be in that mythical  or  and why SHOULDNT it be the one you love?Its heartbreaking I know but try your very best not to focus on numbers. Best of luck.,breastcancer,d4iplx9,1,t5_2t6dy
8681063,0,t3_4yvgc9,The big thing for me was that for some reason I thought once I was cured then life would be the same again.  Instead even though Id completed treatment including a double mastectomy I kept thinking what if one little cancer cell was still floating around in there.  I wanted to know what we were going to DO besides Arimidex and even got mad at my oncologist for saying now we just monitor.  It took me a long time to realize that once you are a cancer patient youre sort of always a cancer patient.  ,breastcancer,d6qr9ru,4,t5_2t6dy
