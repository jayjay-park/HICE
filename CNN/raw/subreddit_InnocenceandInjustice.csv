7591261,0,t3_4j91zd,I need more information on this shooting before I can answer your question. I have mixed feelings about the current dynamic between LE and the people. I obviously dont think cops should be shooting people indiscriminately but at the same time working those streets is a bitch. I am not quick to judge some of these shootings as just another cop on a power trip they seem to be genuinely scared when they unload on these potential bad guys. ,InnocenceandInjustice,d3537el,4,t5_3eiuh

7672506,0,t1_d3e58t3,Thats a very interesting approach. I do see some issues though. What would you do in cases where disposed of murder weapons DNA trace evidence etc cannot be found or were disposed of by the perpetrator of the crime?In my opinion confession guidelines need to be completely overhauled much like what has happened in The UK. There are times a confession would make sense and might b the only way to give a family closure. Trying to force people into confessing when they swear they are innocent goes against everything honest and moral.,InnocenceandInjustice,d3ebhz7,4,t5_3eiuh
7683932,0,t1_d3flj7r,As long as it is relevant to sub its Xposted in then its all chill under rediquette..as far as what I read.  Doesnt mean the other subs moderators have to like it it isnt shameless self promoting..only getting info out on as many relevant subs as possible. Also good info in that there are also specific subs like rpromote or rshamelessplug to full on promote it.  Ive been slacking as the Marketing department  lead...lol.EDIT had the other subs sort of wrong... the better one K Subcribers to promote new reddit is rnewreddits  or the smaller one is  rpromotereddit,InnocenceandInjustice,d3fm6j6,5,t5_3eiuh
8457548,0,t1_d5yphxi,Ha! If youre US then I guess you would call them fries shops except you dont have them. Theyre a type of fast food outlet that sells chipsfries with just about anything that can be deep fried  usually battered fish but everything from sausages to Mars bars and pizzas. Every high street in the UK has about  chip shops theyre a way of life.,InnocenceandInjustice,d5yq88k,2,t5_3eiuh
