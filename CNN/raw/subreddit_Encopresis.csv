11620777,0,t3_65mooe,Hi and thanks for noticing!  I have high standards for info and wanted to be able to collect and store it for myself and others.  Reddit is a perfect tool for this purpose!  I dont post much now but still try to check the sub every now and then.  We are in a good place right now so this topic is no longer consuming me.   Best of luck to you!  My advice is always always investigate thyroid thoroughly.  ,Encopresis,dgd855j,1,t5_341n1
