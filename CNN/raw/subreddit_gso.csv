2687463,0,t3_2qt49s,are you looking for something with a large bridge?  Bicentennial Gardens off Holden has a large stone bridge wide creek with banks.  Across Hobbs you might find Bog Garden accessible and theres a large lake at the end. There are some small creeks in Fisher Park that might be nice.   Bicentennial Greenway from Piedmont Parkway essentially High Point and Gallimore Dairy would be easy to get in and out of but those are more highbanked to overlook than to be in. Theres a somewhat wide in spots pretty creek in the greenway in the middle of Hamilton Lakes check out the end at StarmountKemp.  Nice creek good hardwood canopy. One runs near the greenway on Benjamin Pkwy too but I havent been through there.  Less wooded than the other options.  Im sure there are tons more but those are ones that Ive experienced hope those help. Maybe share what you come up with in the end. ,gso,cn9dde5,4,t5_2s3px
