1794777,0,t1_ck5ag3s,Cell raids are  random. You just have to use Fake Vents your desk on any holes and Posters to not get caught. I assume you have a  chance per rolecall because there are  prisoners and  win a cell toss.,theescapists,ck5dq12,1,t5_30n3t

3462439,0,t3_2wacp2,I was wondering if sprite  object rotations are possible. If not Im assuming the way the objects and spites face are hardcoded into the game. But if not it would still be a hassle as Java isnt all friendly with sprite rotations.Another thing is it a bugOr a feature mwuhahaha that when I place down things they look normal in the editor and later rotate? Its annoying.           Great program the best program IVE made is a D block building game which is still admirable for being in middle school. I appreciate how much time and work you devote to this program too.,theescapists,cpmxyk0,1,t5_30n3t
