935345,0,t1_chal323,TareyaShe could hear them talking about her. They had heard her run around behind the tree. They were going to be curious. She had to get out of here. Her worry made her focus more on them noticing her instead of what else they said so she didnt even know that they were having similar reactions to her about this world. That they were PCs. Adventurers.Turning around she tried to run off. She got a couple steps away from the tree before her new bodys topheaviness threw her off balance. She fell to the ground with a Gyafun!,ElderTaleRP,chalqva,1,t5_31l94
971216,0,t1_cheo6iw,SimonSimon smiled as Yama asked if he was ready and told him the plan.  Got it. Simon said confidently.  Yama took off to fight the mob of giants.  Simon followed after him after he fist bumped his fists and ignited them aflame.  He licked his lips and smiled menacingly.  He stopped a few feet away from one of the giants as he used his buff Ketsueki Kureriji to beat the living pulp out of all the giants.  He spat out some blood yet again as he did his buff and grew a bright orange color. Your dead meat... Giants.  Simon said in the most sinister way possible with a menacing grin.  He took after the one in front of him.However as soon as he took one step.  He froze in place.  Something had gone wrong.  A Am I having a hallucination?  Is this real?  What the fuck?!  Simon looked all around as he saw all the giants as an image of himself from before the Apocalypse.  His mind was playing tricks on itself.  He could see the Simon who was a PKer before him as all the giants.  He couldnt move his body was scared.  It didnt like the old Simon.  His eyes focused forward in front of him as a mirror image of himself of the present faded in.  He looked like he did back then.  Simons eyes grew wide as he saw what he had become.  He had regressed back to his PKing self.  No wonder he was using life threatening skills and not giving a damn about pain.  All he cared about was killing these giants.  He had forgotten about their goal... Yama... Myucel.  Behind the image of himself he saw a flower with purple pedals and a gold inside.  It was beautiful.  I wanna give that to Myucel...  Simon said in a monotone voice as he walked through the illusion of himself.  Back on the field Simon was walking through all of the smaller mob giants.  Every single one he walked by tried to attack him but he just pluck them off in defense as he continued to walk to the flower.   He had finally got to the flower.  It was beautiful as he hovered over it.  He crouched down and felt its pedals.  It feels so real... This world is so... real He plucked it from its stem as he stuck it in his inventory bag.  His UI notified him that he added something to his inventory.  He smiled.A gift for Myucel...  Simon thought.  Simon had moved from his original location.  The illusions that replaced the giants were gone and he came to again.  He looked around the battlefield as he saw Yama fighting.  Where am I? Wasnt I over there?  Hey Yama!  How did I get over he...  Simon said before getting interrupted by a very large shadow hovering over him.  Simon had wondered over to the back of the mob of giants where the boss was.  He looked up at in shock.  Well... fuck.  He glanced over his shoulder at Yama who he assumed was concerned as fuck for Simon seeing as he spaced out for a good few minutes.  He smiled at him.See ya on the other side Yam...!  Simon shouted before being crushed by the Giants hammers repetitively.  There were screams of pain coming from his direction.  It seems everyone was right.  You do still feel pain as you die but the fact still remains will you die for good... or will you respawn.The boss giant stopped as the area where Simon was flattened to a crisp.  Simon was no where to be seen but there was evidence of blood where he stood and on the giants hammers.  ,ElderTaleRP,cheoqdq,1,t5_31l94
978208,0,t1_chfgeh4,Well its possible to hit  through quests alone  so its a valid question  A few thoughts flew through his head as this discussion happened.  If Dakarin had gotten rushed chances were high that his experience was a little bit on the low side.  On top of that if they were guild runs he had squeezed into chances were high that no one ever took the time to explain these fights properly before.   Though Hachirous current gear was significantly above standard for this instance theyd more likely than not need a couple other players to tag along due to the duos nonexistent damage.Hmm.  I was thinking we try the very first one for level cap.  Have you heard of The Forest of Giants before?  Its a good entry level dungeon with decent drops.  The conversation continued as such with a fairly pleasant pace not even skipping a beat when the assassin mentioned Hachirous face getting bashed in.  With a hearty thump hed again point at his chest plate with a confident smile.  This old hunk of junk has seen more frightful things than some lousy giants.   Worst case scenario Ive got this beauty too.  A hand motioned towards his rear to indicate a rather large and imposing tower shield that appeared to be made of ice.  From its outer surface impressive spikes protruded giving it a daunting appearance.Well probably want one at least one more player though ideally two preferably one healer.,ElderTaleRP,chfhbf9,1,t5_31l94
1046960,0,t1_chna8d8,MercuriusSmiling tapped a few buttons on his UI. First we could make this business partnership more official. A guild invite for Critical Care appeared in Arashis HUD. If alls played right room and board will be the least of your pay.,ElderTaleRP,chnalj0,1,t5_31l94
1987068,0,t1_cks4j90,SimonSimon was walking sort of funny down to the tree.  He was feeling nervous about this whole situation now.  He looked really stiff as he moved his head looking around for Myucel.  At the same time  Sakura was trying to get Simon to stop looking stupid and to calm down.All of a sudden Simon got a text from a friend.  It popped up in his face.  It read  Hey man. Sent by Yama .  His eyes went wide as he suddenly forgot his nervousness.  Oh shit... Its Yama.  Simon thought.Simon quickly went through his options to send him a message back.  He typed out his response.gt  Hey Bro!  Give me a few... I gotta find Myucel.  But Ill totally be down to beat down some baddies with ya. Simon clicked send and it went to Yama.  He suddenly realized what he had just typed and remembered about the situation he was in.  The situation everybody was in.  He suddenly got depressed again as he walked over to the tree.  He started to bang his head against the tree.  How could I send that?  We cant fight monsters... if this is real... then we could really die...  Simon thought as his face turned pale.,ElderTaleRP,cksn4pl,1,t5_31l94
