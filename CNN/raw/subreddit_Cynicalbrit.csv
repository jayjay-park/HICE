67473,0,t1_celfu73,It doesnt help when they give numbers like v with  AI players for each team and each player can have AI controlled Titan which means they can have  players just that only  of them are human. Which means it doesnt look as impressive as it should be.They obviously done this so that it allowed every player to play as a mech at once and you dont have to miss a go. This will also make players to feel like a Titan when using a mech as the AI are not going to be as good as a real player which means big kill streaks.Only problem is this illusion is ruined when you know that all the players you been killing are not real people and to hardcore shooters killdeath ratio in this game means nothing as well as kill streaks. Afterall if you played Counter Strike and was owning everyone you would feel like a boss until you realize that they was just bots and only one of the player on the other team was an actual human.,Cynicalbrit,cem411v,3,t5_2tqbt
70866,0,t3_1utvoy,I have to say I very much enjoy the series  The detailed analysis is great and allows me to make my own conclusions. I have yet to see any player including myself and streamers who are much better than me perform flawlessly every game and since you dont know what the enemy has in his hand and is about to topdeck it would also take luck to do so. Every time I watch a stream almost every turn there will be people shouting Do this do that you are so bad lethal!!! so backseat gamers and people shouting at their screens are probably unavoidable sadly. I hope that those of us who like to discuss strategy in general and how to react in similar situations dont contribute too much to the problem. I think TB is a better player than me but that doesnt mean Id always follow his plays and I think questioning them and thinking for myself and recieving feedback in a forum like this contributes to making me a better player.Something that would make the series even more fun for me And maybe make it feel less serious? would be some added challenges for the drafting  Picking middle cards lowest cost cards as many spell cards as possible etc. Of course this would lower the average amount of wins and rewards.,Cynicalbrit,cemhwlp,1,t5_2tqbt

155556,0,t3_1vj4fk,Ive backed multiple kickstarter projects and Im very happy with how things have gone. Even when Takedown was released in the state that it was I cant say I was upset since that project was clearly the riskiest sounding of all the projects that I did back. But it was a project I wanted to back well worth the risk of showing support to the developers.Then there is Steam. Where games that are way more unfinished than Takedown ever was fill the most sold list on Steams frontpage week after week. I dont think Steam should ever give frontpage promotion to alpha stage games.Personally Im upset about early access too because I would like to try a game like DayZ or Rust. But I dont want to waste my time on alpha games. However if I wait for a proper release of these games then I will start my adventure in a game where the community has played the game for months already. Nothing of what interests me the most about these games will be left by that point. There will be no exploration. There will be no survival against the game world. No novelty. There will only be PvP against enemies armed to the teeth. There will be wiki pages containing item spawn points and players running straight to these spots. There will be maps showing the entire game area. I really dont see me joining these interesting sounding games because of this.,Cynicalbrit,cew5dze,1,t5_2tqbt
158831,0,t3_1vv19u,Ouch that video was quite a painful one. Orcs were going to be a hard game in general. But the game certainly wasnt helping youThe first half its fair to say that Quil generally outplayed you though. Dice were sorta fair the Rain is the thing that sucked about it as it made your best stragety of run away really fast and score not likely to happen At least it wasnt Blizzard that would have been worse. Critical Misplay of the game though was the first pass with the Pogoer with the rain making it very hard to make the pass in the first place. It would have been better to just keep hold of the ball and run it up with your pogo player you would have atleast made it harder to score for the Orcs as they have to run more and they are a very slow team indeed. This possibly could have prevented Quill scoring in the first half and pontentially letting you have more options for Secret Weapons in the second half. As is though even without the luckiest Blood Bowl pickup Quill probably would have scored on turn  or  which would leave you  secret weapons down in the second half.Second Half though... not much to say really the dice just hated you at that point. From the stupid trolls to the chainsaw even the last turn I was expecting your Troll to just straight up die because nuffle didnt like you that day. Its that field just try to avoid ever playing on the farmyard ever again. It rains all the time and the dice are not in your favour there.Tips tips tips for next game... Ah! Hopefully next game should be better because you are up against Dodger and the Halfblings! There is only one simple strategy for this match. Be a Lumberjack! Get your Chainsaw and your Fanatic Goblins on the field quickly and knock down those trees! The Lumberjack and his  Chainsaw means those Trees will be taking injury rolls a lot more often than normal. The  for injuries suddenly becomes nearly a half as you only need a  instead of a normal  to take them down. Plus once down since the trees are so slow. They actually need to roll to get up off the ground. Terrorize the Trees with your Secret Weapons and then use your barely faster and barely better armoured goblins to take out the Halfblings. Dodger only has  things in her advantage that game one the Halfling Chef and by now Nuffle should give you mercy on this for once and two those trees. Take out the trees and Dodger should fall easily. And the Secret Weapons are the best way to do it. The Fanatic outstrength the tree and will get atleast one tree down on the first turn. The Loony doesnt even need to check strength to cut a tree down and has a great chance to take a tree out of the game Although be forewarned of Blitzes on the Chainsaw guy the chainsaw acts against the loony on being knocked down meaning only a  on armour will injure him. Thats an  in  And the Bombadier might want to throw a bomb to knock them down. You could pontentially knock down all  Trees first turn with the Bombadier! but be warned you can also knock down your  Line of Scrimmage players on the first turn as well.And dont panic if Dodger decides not to put her trees on the line of scrimmige if she does that so the secret weapon players cant reach them straight away they probably wont be moving that far for the rest of the drive. If at all.Anything else to say to generally help... the Fanatic can infact roll on grounded guys should he step on them. And its just a straight armourinjury roll. Its not even considered a foul. Dont forget the Fanatic can also be used to create tackle zones and block as well. Plus with Attack  he isnt getting taken down very easily.And although many of us would like to see Jesse get retired. Im pretty sure hes overexagerating that smashed knee he seemed to run fine for  squares straight before falling over and saying Ow my knee. Having more goblins act as cannon fodder is good anyway. Means you have spares on hand so that you dont have to have all your secret weapons on the field straight away which can be helpful in later matches to come. And any extras can be used for totally legal fouling on those important players like those trees youll be facing next week which should get removed as soon as possible.,Cynicalbrit,cewiv5q,5,t5_2tqbt

And it had monthly subscription and to add that microtransactions they were triple dipping.I got it after I saw the sale the fact they dropped micropayments off no subscription fee the free addons so good support from devs and Dwarves addon coming up...The game actually is what I told it is StrongholdAoE combined with some of the MampB campaign stuff.You build your Town improve it new units gather resources upgarde things... Then you can make armies pack them with goods go to other towns to do trade or siege them do quests... PvP is you defending your town against other peoples armies or you attacking theyr towns via matchmakingHavent done that yet still have immunity for little while that you get as new player It is all really good if you get thru the shortcomings and that is the kind of thing you like.One thing that helps is the ingame chat community is great helpfull and noobfriendly answering questions and giving tips.I suggest checking some gameplay footage before buying but if you ask me it is worth it. But again it is a bit same way rough as MampB is lowbudget lots of problems but great game behind all that.It would be interesting to see WTF from it but TB would just destroy it since hes serie is about firstimpressions this game takes a bit time to get gears running and all  available factions now all play differently.,Cynicalbrit,ceyw5n5,1,t5_2tqbt

TB can only manage it because hes been doing stuff like this in general for...what...close to a decade now?

325893,0,t3_1xta1y,Heres a copy of the original text post by uwoojimgtIn response to TBs fans whether youre on the side of I understand where TB is coming from or hes taking it too personal I found an interesting example of what TB might be going through.gtI think giving a concrete example of whats happening on an individual level might better explain why TB is the way he is rather than saying you dont understand you dont know what its like being famous although I cant say that I even remotely understand what he is going through.gtIve been on the side of hes taking things too personal until I encountered this commentgtand further in thisgtgtDisappointed because people disagree with him in a mature manner ?Just take a look at this long post here TBs response was something along the lines of lol youre a fanboi get lostHis viewers are the ones that have every right to be disappointed with his behaviour in regards to dissenting opinions and the way he treated them today with this controversy.gtthis comment seemed pretty popular and well supported by others and I agreed to it in my ignorance to what actually was going on but I was curious as to what the whole ordeal was.gtAfter I had read what was said in the WTF is broken age comment section linked above I realized that TBs reaction against umaldamus might have been expected if not justified. The points he listed only told me the user did not watch the video or pay attention to what TB was saying.gtHis first point was that TBs criticism against DF releasing half the game now and half later is absolutely ridiculous.gtIf you actually watch the video and listen to him in no way does he ever actually criticize what they did. All he said was that there was a controversy surrounding double fines production of the game through a kickstarter and that in this video he shall look to see if the game is any good.gtHis second point was better constituted for an argument but it still lacked what gtI think your argument completely falls apart with pointandclick adventure games.You simplifying the description of these games by saying you rub an item is overly simplistic and frankly inaccurate.Its not about the interface but how the player interacts with that interface.How the player is consciously interacting with that interface.gtTBs video surrounded the idea that the actual mechanics of the games are how he usually liked to grade the games and in the case of Broken Ages traditional pointandclick mechanic it was too simple and antiquated mechanic to say that thats where the games strong points are. Especially when other companies like telltale games took the same approach in a refreshing and more interactive manner. He then talks about what may be called a game and whether certain pointandclicks like Broken Age are justified to be called a game.gtHere is what TB said in the video to pretty much respond to umaldamus s response to the videogtgtpointandclick games are generally based around dialogue whereby you click all the dialogue options until you find the right one and then rubbing an item against something else. its really as simple as that. you pick up items you combine them and you use them to solve puzzles.and thats it you know? that is the extent of the game.and in this case thats exactly what happens. now the first hour or so is extremely linear and it opens up a little bit it gives a little more exploration but ultimately you still have to do tasks in a specifc order in order to actually advance.and as with most old school pointandclick games its a little bit of dialogue its a little bit of hidden object game and its that sort of basic pointandclick logic puzzle.and i say pointandclick logic because some of it is quite ridiculous.itsahabsurd in the sense of oh ii absolutely cannot in any way figure out whats going on here because my brain doesnt work the same way as the designers did.gtthis is why i find it really difficult to critique a pointandclick because recently traditional pointandclicks have become kind of less and less popular as the telltale method of doing things which is actually closer to an rpg than it is to a pointandclick has come into play.if you think about a telltale rpg like the wolf among us that is a game in which it involves some qte combat which has failure states its also got dialogue options which are time specific and mutually exclusive and actually have permenant consequences.so it really is about playing a role more so than it is solving puzzles and in fact the first chapter of wolf among us basically has no puzzles of any description really. you certainly pick up items and you rub them against other items but thats not actually the focus of the title.and it seems like its almost just there to provide lip service to the genre more so than anything that is necessary. same with the walking dead. and those are the kind of games that i can really appreciate because i like games where the choices that you make have genuine consequences and those games do that very very well indeed. i like games that have failure states and games that dont have failure states well ive made the argument that theyre not even video games. which i know is kind of ridiculous and people are gonna argue definition of a video game is very arbitrary but these are the kind of games that i prefer to watch rather than play and thats a little bit unfortunate because when i first got into games i got into games to PLAY THEM not to watch them.now some would argue that the reward in a pointandclick game and this is the same as broken age is in the solving of these rub item x on item y kind of puzzles. and i would accept that there is certainly some enjoyment to be had from that and there is a sense of reward but i dont find the sense of reward is strong enough. and indeed this is a game that is focused on the story. and almost entirely on the story. and frankly the problem with that is that if i wanted to watch a story i would watch a story i would go and watch something on television. i dont play for the story i play for the indepth mechanics. and when i critique something i try to critique the mechanics of the game. and this game barely has any. you know? does the xlets think about the mechanics about a second. okay so the mechanics consist of solely moving from room to room and rubbing x on y. yeah? from what ive seen there is not a single piece of dialogue that is mutually exclusive between another so you can explore all the pieces of the dialogue completely without any issues whatsoever. thats absolutely fine. totally fine.and then youve got the use x on y.and i suppose you can critique how interesting some of that is like oh is this very creative? does it use some very intersting logic ? and so on and so forth. possibly. but thats about as far as it goes and then after that youve got to think about stuff like well is the aesthetic any good? is the writing any good? is the story any good? and i dont do well when it comes to talking about the story. becuase im not really focused on that. ive said it before i would prefer to play a game that is mechanically very good that has a terrible storyline like say metal gear rising over a game like broken age.but the thingheres the thing you cant then say well broken age is a bad game because i dont like it or even because it sticks to the tropes of the pointandclick genre because thats exactly what they were trying to do in the first place. can you criticize a pointandclick for being a pointandclick.you can talk about the genre but i dont think you can individually criticize a game for doing just what its supposed to do. that said im going to say if i were to saycomment that hey im a big  fan of the pointandclick genre eh? i absolutely adore the pointandclick genre and ive played all sorts of things like day of the tentacle and grim fandango and monkey island and disk world and ive beaten them all and a lot of this stuff was very tricky.and then i look at broken age what i would find at least in the first part is that the actual rub x on y puzzles are fairly simplistic.there are a couple which very much use some really really strange logic.and you would get a little bit stuck on that kind of stuff i would imagine.butBUUTT is that ais that enough to really keep people interested? if you were able to blitz through the puzzles is that sense of satisfaction that i was talking about earlier actually a thing? eh? maybe not.Continued in reply,Cynicalbrit,cfejsd8,3,t5_2tqbt

It would probably depend on the game as well. More sandboxlike or open world games like Minecraft with limited to no story probably dont mind because people playing the game encourage others to buy it while story heavy games like Bioshock Infinite probably do lose some revenue because most consider the gameplay to be pretty weak while the story is good.  ,Cynicalbrit,cflqogv,1,t5_2tqbt

Im pretty happy with this TB wtf in general. This game is being bashed by most big outlets... and they had reason to. The heavy discounts and apparently troubled development is reason for people to be concerned.However TB is sticking to the fact he likes it and from a superficial look at his impressions... i think he has some points that overshadow the apparent problems other reviews and first impressions are giving.I always wonder with TB whether he is being at least maybe a LITTLE contrarian and with something like this i wonder whether saying you like it when everybody doesnt is just another form of contrarianism... however I think all of that is usually just icing on the cake and hes generally true to the opinions he represents in his videos... so he honestly likes this... which is good news for anybody who wants a new PS game.Another game that I agree with TB on being underrated is sleeping dogs.

417836,0,t3_1ytthr,I rather read a review from a reviewer who believes they are being objective because ultimately it means the person should be coming from a neutral perspective one which uses arguments that anyone can analyze and critique as cogent and sound or not for some objective reason. Their view is open to dissent. If I disagree with them then I need to provide proof why.The alternative is to have some wishywashy version of what truth means. Why is the limit of relativism art when science lays upon the philosophy of science? What of Humes problem of induction? What of grue and Nelson Goodman? Why pick these lines in the sand as scientific and objective and not these other ones when both have plenty of problems?I work in the game industry and have a degree in philosophy particularly normative concepts such as goodbad morality metaethics etc. The discussion you present in extremely more nuanced and deeper than what is let on here. Its far from a clearcut decided issue.You can continue to use the arguments of postmodernism Richard Rorty and the like if you wish but I encourage you and anyone actually interested in this topic to really read up about this discussion and be informed if youre going to present a view.

I dont care about subs it doesnt add anything to my enjoyment it just makes it more tedious to watch.Right those two arent dubbed. Dubs detract from my enjoyment honestly. I take it you are a native english speaker? Since where Im from everything is in english and I used to watch it with subtitles all the time and it didnt bother me. Now Im fluent and dont need it anymore but reading subtitles doesnt bother me. Of course its preference but the dubs are usually pretty bad. gtWell I loved Cowboy Bebop and NGE and Code Geass and Death Note I just cant believe that there arent more Anime like that.There is but not dubbed. Code Geass for me was a trainwreck death note wasnt exactly a train wreck but it wasnt that enjoyable either.

568598,0,t1_cg4r4a4,You might be write regarding the objective in HOTS so far I did not play it so I base my assessment on what I have seen so I might be completely wrong when I try it myself.From what I have seen though so far the objectives look pretty straight forward.When it comes to charts that is of course an overexaggeration so sorry for that. The fact that DOTA build in the player builds thingy is amazing and a great step towards the right direction which simplifies the process.When it comes to LoL and I need to stress this out I played LoL last time two years ago so everything probably changes by now but I remember that the recommended item list in LoL according to everyone was absolute garbage. This meant I had to go out and I can not remember for the love of me the website but find builds online and use them as reference. Figuring that out which build is up to date or not plus just the way the hero played was a lot of effort all of a sudden.And I can not stress this enough I like that there are games like that but I am not willing to put in so much effort into a multiplayer game.And it is the little things I remember in both DOTA and LoL being screamed at people because I was taking too much time search for an item in the shop since I could not find it while the team was freaking out. So just having the interface changed to a talent on the city popup is already a difference to me.It is hard to explain for me with words but seeing HOTS it reminds me of the streamlined process similar as SMITE did with items if I recall correctly which just upgrade the item so the list is smaller so you can get familiar quickly with items rather than knowing what is combined into what to make what. And one last thing i would like to point out this is a view of a person outside the genre who is not familiar with it. So granted I am probably wrong in certain aspect however I am pretty sure there are other people like me with this view on the MOBA genre and I think Blizzard understands that and is aiming it at people like me.,Cynicalbrit,cg4wl43,1,t5_2tqbt

The ideas he brings to the table are always well thought out and laid out in a way that is quite entertaining. After a tough day at work it makes my day to listen to another intelligent person give their perspective on the things that I am interested in. I just wish there was a more reliable way of letting him know how much I appreciate all the effort he puts in to his work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,Cynicalbrit,cgfiedz,6,t5_2tqbt

731044,0,t1_cgnb671,Absolutely not. Its capped at  but the moment anything starts to happen it just drops.  tried to optimize too much out of the engine and it shows its beautiful when nothings happening or when people are just moving across the screen and even if theyre just firing weapons. A single grenade? Two? A rocket launcher? An armor power or two? Maybe a vehicle? A needler? Once the fights start going the  just cant handle it anymore. In a vacuum it looks great. But  optimized it for the vacuum not the actual game so they just did too much for everything. If it were on a PC nobody would care because theres just the processing power to handle that a hundredfold. Grifball is perhaps the best example  players constantly swinging the single weapon that breaks the games engine the most flying across the map as the game engine quickly breaks. Its hilarious and horrible at the same time Its great fun to just dick around with your friends for maybe half an hour at most but its just awful to get maybe  fps and a plethora of game breaking glitches because the engine is just breaking.Edit This problem is the biggest reason why I stopped playing Halo .

849918,0,t3_23t3nc,I generally like the series because the games that get showcased are differentutter crap. However I feel it might be more likeable if TB entertained more. Now he is being pretty serious and it is basically a WTF is... with a bonus rant against steam and the lack of curation.While it is definitely a valid point it does get repetitive hearing him voice his criticisms on Steam.Maybe include more games not necessarily the ones that were published on Steam the most recent per episode and give a quick witty rundown on each? He would run out of games pretty quick probably. In its current form however I feel it might run out of steam pun not intended pretty soon though. It is a valid point but the entertainment value is reduced due to the repeated steam criticism and the fact that most of the games that would fall in this genre often arent worth the attention and dont make for interesting discussion.I am curious in seeing what he will do on his channel with all nonWTF is... content.,Cynicalbrit,ch0w1np,1,t5_2tqbt

So extreme props to you.  And glad to see some awareness being put out there.  Personally I have a ton of bowel and stomach issues. I got hit by a car when I was a kid was on my bicycle on the sidewalk.  Was a hit and run.  But I got speared by the hood ornament thing.  And pretty much ruined my small bowel due to severe infection.  Over the course of my teenage life into adulthood Ive had to have most of it removed.  On top of that I have crohns disease.  So my stomachintestines hate me immensely. D Not to steal your light just thought Id share my story.Ive had family with colon cancer and it is really terrible if full fledged.  And it seems to be prominent on my fathers side.  Luckily hes not stubborn enough to go to the doctor.But yes people DONT be afraid of the doctors.  A good doctor is the best thing in the world.  A doctor you can trust and talk to freely is the best friend youll ever have.

Just comparing the US EU and Korean scene alone should hold significant differences not even counting teams with unique strategies like Fanatic.For a game to grow as an eSport the tournaments have to offer money and thus attract pro players.

1021476,1,t3_25sswr, Im frustrated that there are too many viewers that dont appreciate a quality product Im frustrated that weve got to a point where many people prefer unedited nonsense with no quality control over an attempt to create a quality production Im frustrated that peoples defense of such things seems to boil down to little more than its my opinion and you should respect it when they dont do the same for mine which comes from a position of experience on the subject and Im frustrated that in this day and age experienced Youtubers somehow still make these mistakesThat bit was  unnecessary.....I can respect his opinion on not putting out product he is not happy with I wish more people took that line though in this case Id be tempted to put up the vid a record an audio commentary over it instead of the actual. At least then the vid is not totally wasted esp as we are expecting it after the first vid...But that attack on viewers was totally unjustified and totally unrelated to the issue here. The vid producers fucked up but he rants about viewers....Also TB hate to break it to you but you are just a guy with an opinion....its not worth more than anyone elses. You may think it is its not. I like listening to your opinions and you present them well but lets face it you are a gamer who started making videos...some of us have been gaming longer than you and producing vids and opinions on it.

I dunno I just never felt like there were any cheap deaths I died very few times compared to Dark Souls  maybe a dozen times at most including trying to get down the Majula pit without ladders P.I think it was far more respectful of my time than the first game because interesting stuff like pvp was easy to undertake. You didnt have to farm for consumables and the like. I felt like I was punished for experimenting with pvp and coop in the first game and I wasnt in Dark Souls .Even though Dark Souls  felt a bit less masterfully crafted than the original and was much easier..I think I had more fun with it.

This also applies to South Park BUT if they did whole work making it look like show would be ruined. We come back around the circle that yes they can make Order  to run at  FPS to make it appear more movielike but some may definitly prefer it to run  FPS when gameplay is happening. OPTION. Same with their aspect ratio nonsense. Like I said in earlier post L.A. Noire already tried that film look locking game to  FPS and certainly didnt do it at all but instead made it horrible to play especially with mouse.

1227885,0,t3_285uxw,Nowhere was said that female characters are a feature. Unplanned things are a feature. The game was planned with a single male protagonist thus any additional alternative protagonist is a feature regardless of gender.Also TB talks about Space Marinestyle male characters being the sexualized male. Only half true. Youre either the grumpy Space Marine or a slender prettyboy. Seeing an ugly prettyboy or a pretty Space Marine is as rare as seeing a fat chick like Ellie Borderlands .However I am really tired of male leads. There are only  stock characters available which are repeatedly used ad infinitum. Female characters have some much unseen potential. I am starving for them.I would also like to add a thing about target audience. Correct me if Im wrong but there is no evidence that straight white male protagonists makes straight white males people immerse better or care more for the character.If I might give a counterexample to that argument Look at Avatar Legend Of Korra.Conventional wisdom according to Konietzko had it that girls will watch shows about boys but boys wont watch shows about girls. The creators eventually persuaded the channels executives to change their mind.

This is also the reason why TLoU port on PS took more time and effort according to ND than making a new engine for Uncharted ...Doesnt help the PC hardware market is being crap with the only significant upgrades over the last years being on the very expensive cards while the lowmid range performance remain almost the same the biggest improvement on midlow range from the Nvidia  over the  was power consumption not performance and CPU performance havent been improved that much either we have even had newer generation high end CPUs performing worst than the older ones from AMD in the last few years incident too...,Cynicalbrit,ci9u58o,6,t5_2tqbt

1283174,0,t1_ciddgdq,Many people dont understand marketing so no worries.Exposure in a public space  MarketingRegardless to not keep going around in a circle and I feel Ill just keep on repeating myself which is just bad posting I am split about whether or not the developer should get any royalty or revenue from the videos. My concern and issue is really two things.The first thing being is Lets Play  Something you watch JournalismImpressionsInformed content  Something you research Should I buy this game or not?I dont like Lets Plays too much and albeit one can discuss into infinity what is and what isnt piracy I do not doubt Lets Plays treads a fine line of it. I have watched Lets Plays in the past when I didnt have enough money to buy the game or I just outright felt Im not going to buy that! Ill just watch it!. Others have spoken of the same thing so I know I am not alone.Lets Plays  You can go and say that I buy games I watch on Lets Plays but that doesnt mean that everyone else is doing it. Hardly otherwise people who create Lets Plays wouldnt be AS successful from their piggyback riding. LP creators need an audience and viewers to be successful and if the audience would play the games then LPs would be out of a business.The second thing I have a concern withLets Plays do not generate sells in the BEST way. There are better ways. Informed content like TotalBiscuits does generate sells currently in the best way and in the most way. If content creator JesseCox would try his hand at a WTF is... equivalent for his channel I bet that video would generate more sells for the developers than what his other content does. Listen developers have been outspoken about this matter Written Press  Generates a couple of sells. Lets Play  Generates a couple of sells or low sells depending on gamechannel. Informed Content  Generates most sells Such as TBs WTF is or other impressionalist videos.So you see my issue is that developers do not get credited as much as I think they deserve to be because its about Da Internetz Personalitiz fanboiism!. We have to protect our Lets Players who defile this artform called gaming!. Like one of my pictures from previous post a Lets Player either unintentionally or intentionally overshadows the game the ART.Its not much of a gamingcommunity when you dont play the games but rather choose to watch them. A letswatchcommunity.Lets Play  Let US Play but in reality it is more like Let me play for you.Bottom line I just want developers who create these worlds of wonders to have their art expression to flourish. And whilst I am split about whether or not devs should get ad revenue or not I do not doubt for a millisecond that there are MUCH BETTER WAYS TO MARKET the games to generate sells FOR THE DEVELOPERS. Wouldnt that be considered the most fair use?EDIT Without the content that the developers create no LPer would exist. I know they are thankful for what they have gotten from it I just think they should throw more bones to the games rather than at themselves.,Cynicalbrit,cidz2ez,1,t5_2tqbt

1373107,0,t3_29trty,Oh yeah what gaming once was is definitely slipping down the plug hole but the only reason they do it is because other consumers i.e the vast majority are more than happy to support this sort of stuff. In the end they obviously want to make money and to do that they have to appeal to the masses its just a shame that what the masses want is a load of crap. Youll be hard pressed to find people who agree with all the cowadoody linear microtransaction filled BS on the internet but then a lot of the people buying those games dont get involved in games discussion on the internet. Theyre bought by parents who want to give something to their kid to keep them busy who wants it because hisher friends have it and so on. Thats not the case for everyone but its how a lot of the purchases come about. Its by people who dont realise the negative affect theyre having for other people in the purchases they make. Many people will tell you a lot of what Michael Bay makes is rubbish. He already destroyed Transformers but because people support it it gets driven into the ground more and more with sequels and its now given him the opportunity to potentially ruin TMNT as well.Its a true shame but in the end the only reason all this stuff exists is because poorly informed and impatient people buy into it all in the first place. Theres no denying that kids are a huge HUGE part of the gaming market and obviously theyre unlikely to get involved in the business and news side of gaming because they dont give a shit. They just want to play games and as such the car we call the games industry is also being steered by a load of kids who arent interested in learning to drive.

1789173,0,t3_2f0byo,For those of you who are going to play this game here are a few tips to get you started First of all you will pick up so many items and there are tiers of them as you progress through the game so dont worry about crafting you will have too many to craft with and you will end up reforging  of them. No need to be a perfectionist. Mastery is where where you get the majority of your damage so you really need to make use of it.  At the end of the game my firebolt was doing  damage plus it used  of mastery on crit. The mastery debuff I was casting gave a  debuff. This turns a k firebolt to a k firebolt. If you add a control augment to a shock or freeze spell it will have stored damage. This will allow for big crits.  For ex k firebolt plus k stored damage frost or shock x  mastery  k crits. crit  modifiers on these spells was boosting it even more giving me k damage crits. A fully charged freeze will crit and store more damage too and make use of mastery if the enemy is debuffed. At the end of the game my ice spell uses  of mastery on crit as well as added crit modifiers. If I debuff first and then then Freeze I can crit for k with the next firebolt. In the crafting menu on the bottom right you will see Destruction Control and Mastery. The items you pick up will have numbers on them relating to these stats in this order as well as the tier level of the item. If you want to use a freeze or shock spell for crowd control its important to use control augments with a high number of destruction stat on them. This will increase the stored damage part of the spell. You can add more control stat to these spells for more duration but it doesnt matter very quickly into the game as you will have more than enough control without even trying and you will be able to freeze them for  seconds. With a mastery augment a high mastery stat is best because it adds more  debuff. With destruction augments a High destruction stat is best for a higher damage number but some mastery will mean you will make more use of mastery when you crit. My setup was an ice pool aoe with mastery to slow and debuff and a corruption bolt with mastery. This corruption bolt will spawn a flying pustule if you wait  seconds and then kill the monster. It will fly around and debuff for you. I used a control ice lob spell to freeze and add stored damage. I used fire bolt as my main damage spell. This is just one way of playing the game and includes the things I figured out. I have no idea how the other specs work yet. You will discover that all the spells are similar and only have a small perk for each school so you could still use any of the school and get similar results as what I played. ,Cynicalbrit,ck4odod,57,t5_2tqbt

1822052,0,t3_2f9haa,Regarding the format I like it. Sometimes I dont finish watching WTF is...? because I dont have the time or the game itself andor any hilarity involved isnt interesting enough for me to continue even with TBs commentary.  minutes is plenty I think particularly for these games.Regarding the games shownI hate the art and animation style for Bravada. It feels lazy the characters pop around all over place and barely move when they attack and I just want to punch all the humanoid characters in the face for some reason. And referencing Minecraft so blatantly? Really? Are they even allowed to do that? The levels appear to be a slog and the combat is far too simplistic for my tastes...but then again one of my favorite series ever is Shin Megami Tensei aka buff and debuff or be eviscerated so this might be fine for people who arent as hardcore.Tower defense games bore the shit out of me and watching Commando Jack was no exception though at least TB himself made it entertaining.The Sun at Night frustrates me SO HARD. Opening cutscene awesome. Concept awesome. Animation and ingame graphics quality TERRIBLE. What is up with this annoying insanely fastmoving flat style I keep seeing in indie platformers? You are not Sonic the Hedgehog and even those old games didnt have your character bouncing all over the screen like mad. The sprites look flat and the animation quality is poor and I keep freaking seeing this exact style in all these D indie games. Do they use the same engine or something?The gameplay mechanics combat in particular Metroidvaniaesque look somewhat interesting but the ingame art style turns me off so badly...and the cutscenes cant seem to decide what kind of facial geometry Laika has. The map everyone keeps mentioning reminds me of a poormans attempt at Metroid Primes amazing D maps...except in a D format. Uh...ok?

My employer being notified and subsequently coming down on me for such a thing would be perfectly natural as my behaviour affects them directly. Thats only about general behaviour as well. If I were to start taking potshots at other notable entities in the medical industry you can be damn sure itd be considered the views of uCoffeeAndCigars the medical professional not uCoffeeAndCigars the slightly inebriated and bored guy. Like it or not when youre employed somewhere and start talking shit about others in the same field you are very much a representative of your work place and taking it to your superior is exactly what should be done. The fact that they tried contacting him directly beforehand is fairly amazing all by itself as Id frankly skip that step directly and go for the jugular.

1920094,0,t1_ckjsyay,The problem with Video game genres is that there are far too mechanically representative to the point of hilarious detriment. Role Playing Game is actually a really good example of this. Actual RPGs the tabletop ones at least arent about the leveling up or fighting dudes theyre about making decisions about how to interact with the world and the old school design was not to abstract those encounters out like the combat which is why games like DampD have shit social rules. Most video games that we call RPGs really dont do any of that even the really good ones dont have the options the same story would have in a tabletop session In Fallout  Blood Ties is an example of the limited nature of computer RPGs you should be able to end that quest by having the Family buy slaves from Paradise Falls so they dont have to terrorize Arefu any more.ampnbspMost game genres are like this they tell you how the game works and not what the games about. The Modern Warfare games really dont belong in the same genre as Spec Ops The Line or Metroid Prime just like the Lord of The Rings books dont belong in the same genre as Twilight because they both are stories with a third person limited narrator. The only video game genre that is really of any use is Survival Horror because its actually descriptive of the games content rather than its mechanics.,Cynicalbrit,ckkk3qv,1,t5_2tqbt

I dont like the Mens Rights or TRPPUA clowns either.Also downvoting my earlier comment to  simply for daring to express an opinion which they dislike is itself yet another demonstration of why I dislike feminism and doing so is unlikely to cause me to begin sympathising with them.

2198864,0,t1_clj9u00,I chose to get Maya before I even knew about the doge meme. It was only after I picked her that TB mentioned it. Believe me Ive read several books on shibas and any Spitz breed dog can be aggressive toward other dogs. This isnt my first time at the rodeo. I grew up with Huskies so this was not my first Spitz. Maya was the only dog we had when we got her and we would never have added Kumo to the pack had Maya not appeared lonesome. Shibas get bored very easily and her breeder suggested adding a second dog to the home while Maya was relatively young so she would be more receptive. Initially things were great and they got on really well and Maya seemed to be more secure having Kumo around. Unfortunately Japanese Akitas grow rather rapidly and Maya started to get really snarky around Kumo and attacking him for no reason no food toys humans or other resources around. We sent her away to a kennel that specializes in onoff leash training as well as dog on dog aggression. She spent  weeks away from home interacting with all types of dogs from German Shepards to Pugs and everything in between. Never once did she attack another dog while at training and this could be chalked up entirely to the new environment or the fact that Kumo is a very Beta dog and there is no clear Alpha in our pack it was supposed to be Maya but the anxiety took over and she could never fully assert her role. When she came home from training things were once again fine... for a time. Then same behaviors started to show again. You could tell without a clear alpha she just could not cope with how to belong to the pack and she would attack other dogs without provocation because she couldnt handle the anxiety that was building inside of her. Several people that I know have both Japanese Akitas and Shibas and do not have these types of issues and it is very clear that Maya is special. In the end she is getting what she needs but I am still heartbroken. ,Cynicalbrit,cljbvtb,25,t5_2tqbt

2264081,0,t3_2l09u9,TB wrote this on gg a few days ago on why he thinks Anita has never once been criticized by the pressgtI think theyre scared. I really do. People that criticize Sarkeesian take a lot of flak. The misogyny card is very powerful. You get that played against you and good luck shaking it. I told to people to calm down and had a Silverstring Media employee write a long rambling essay about how awful a person I was and how rapey my interpretations of journalistic ethics was. How do you even answer that? Theyre incendiary thoughtterminating cliches.gtI got no doubt that some sites believe the ends justify the means that even if she is frequently wrong about things the overall message of make gaming more inclusive at least thats what they think the message is is worth it. I dont believe that any message is worthwhile if its based on misinformation. The ends do not justify the means. The way you affect changes is with a strong foundation of facts and reasonable discussion.My own view is that their own Anything bad anyone says is harassment death threats! defeated their own message from being accepted. Im sure a lot of it was honest fear of harassment but regardless they still never accepted any criticism whatsoever and actually only recently started not always closing comments and threads criticizing her on all their own sites. When you shut down criticism you can never learn from mistakes and gets others angry at being shut out. Maybe if it was just a troll or two on some blog sure but this was a major issue with thousands of people they said they wanted to have a dialogue about the issue. As another poster said there was no dialogue just a preachy condescending monologue increasingly laced with insults and bitterness at the readers. None of these messagepushing press from Graysons RPS articles to Klepek and others ever variate from each other. Its always one singular opinion with no room for debate stated to be the one moral truth and the very definition of what all Feminism is when its actually just one view of it. Them tightening the screws on opposing views just made things all the more extreme when it finally popped which did not need to happen. Regardless of whether I personally agree with them or not they couldve had a perfectly reasonable and even effective discussion about feminism and minority representation in games if they had just played their cards right and tried to work with the culture they were trying to educate but I doubt that ever couldve happened when they apparently despise them so much and wish they were dead. When her own flaws inevitably become more and more apparent and her narrative starts growing out of control and let me assure you itll happen they will be unable to fix things or correct themselves because theyve already said sometimes implied sometimes directly that anybody who criticizes her is a misogynist and against women. So the last two years of their incessant Anita  All Feminism  All Women  All Morals  All Truth PR campaign will ultimately blow up in their faces if it indeed hasnt already. I think this interview with Anita where for the very first time a critical question was asked of her onthespot and she attempts an answer perfectly shows how theyve been slowly defeating themselves gtThis is the danger involved when you refuse to put your work out for public scrutiny. You dont develop the ability to answer obvious criticisms.

My house hasnt burned down yet so I shouldnt worry about the fire Ill just ignore all the arsonists screaming at me outside. Thats why its a crime to threaten someone with assault thats why its a crime to threaten someones life. Telling people to be quiet about threats of physical violence domestic violence rape and death are deeply harmful and something we need no change. Telling people that they should shut up about all their death threats because he had one that one time which was scary and thats what he did is intentionally ignoring the impact of the tsunami of harassment AND death threats. Coming from the guy who has explicitly talked about the impact of YouTube comments being detrimental to his own health it is weirdly onesided to then claim that others shouldnt be affected by harassment. Your assertion speaks poorly of your decision making. If you genuinely believe that you are talking to a zealot or someone with an IQ below  then why in the world do you continue? Your going to convert a religious fanatic is that it? Your going to somehow explain complex social interaction using last second unconsidered justifications to an imbecile?

2407778,0,t1_cm9553g,gtFamilies with little wealth to begin with have less to pass to their children though inheritance college funding or a down payment on a house. This creates a vicious cycle as those children themselves enter adulthood without a starting boost to wealth accumulation of their own.    Those who are poor have less money to pass on and fewer opportunities than the rich leading to them being poorer in turn. Thus they stay in poverty not because anyone is actively keeping them there but purely because they have few opportunities to get out.    gtpredatory subprime lenders rushed in. Responding to Wall Streets requirements for increased volume and worse terms subprime lenders targeted black and Latino communities for loans of the most toxic and predatory variety    Predatory lenders moving into the areas leach desperate people of their money that puts them into debt and helps keep them poor.

It is the buying and trading of people. It has little to do with sex per se though obviously it is a major component of prostitution.gtIm going to take a leap and say that you see a persons body as some kind of temple or sacred object that should not be used for money.If you hold to the notion that a human should not be used as a tool then it only follows that one would be against prostitution. By definition objectification is the reduction of a person to something less than that.gtI see WILLINGLY using your reproductive organs as sex worker as a legitimate profession that could be akin to working with your hands as a construction worker.Except that you have an undefended premise that consent is what makes it ok. My whole point is that it doesnt matter if one willingly objectifies oneself it still damages the persons dignity and that of human dignity as a whole.Also you again have a false equivalency. The construction worker doesnt sell himself he sells the finished product. Its an apples and oranges comparison.gtIn its current state prostitution is highly exploitative towards the sex worker at least in America due to its illegal nature.Another premise that needs a defense. Just because something is legal doesnt mean it isnt exploitative. And simply making something legal doesnt automatically make the problems go away.gtTo me at least it seems you are downplaying the intention of women who actually want to do this job by saying no its exploitative.I am. Because I contest the notion that consent makes it ok. If someone willingly sells themselves into slavery for example that still doesnt make it right.

2764347,0,t3_2rnw0u,Just got at the part where TB talks about lane defense as a genre. It can actually be done right. The Legendary wars games from Liv Games are actually really great. And if they were to release a pc version with multiplayer there could actually be room for a competitive community.What these games do is allow you to pick a limited amount of units from a  larger pool with some units definitely being a bit more endgame than others. Much like RTS games these series have cheaper scrubs and better more expensive units you buy with resources you continuously acquire over the course of a game. Every unit also has a special which actually changes its mechanics when you upgrade that unit.Juggling your units specials is actually quite hard to do on a mobile platform thats why I wish the devs would bring it over to pc. Whilst you probably wouldnt attract anyone who is dedicated to RTS games the game certainly would be great to have on pc if only for being able to micromanage with a mouse instead.of touch.,Cynicalbrit,cnian4i,4,t5_2tqbt

He is a source to use during research to be compared to others. TB is not to be used as a one stop source unless you agree regularly with him and have similar specs and should be treated as such. Dont like an opinion he has? Find a critic that is either closer to you or contrasts TB to see the other side.

2906754,0,t1_cnyhu3q,Now you are moving the discussion into the realm of be nice to everybody and do not offend anyone. That is not how humour in a free society works. I refer you to this nice quote by Stephen Fry about being offended and what this actually means and contributes.Wikipedia defines transphobia thus gtTransphobia or less commonly transprejudice is a range of antagonistic attitudes and feelings against transsexuality and transsexual or transgender people based on the expression of their internal gender identity TB did not express any antagonistic feelings and attitudes against any of the things named there. He mocked tumblrites MAKING A MOCKERY OF transsexuality. Where in that do you find transphobia or malicious intent? Here is where I refer you back to Stephen Fry. Taking offense with something does not automatically make you right. Your feelings do not stop others from doing anything. You do not gain anything from being offended. And in this case nobody even took offense until Wu stirred shit up for the sake of creating controversy to further her own agenda.And since TB was never even attempting to belittle actual trans persons the whole transphobia angle falls apart. All that remains is a whine. A pathetic cowardly whine to further her own agenda.,Cynicalbrit,cnyi6ix,16,t5_2tqbt

3006840,0,t1_co9j42g,Ive also been thinking on why the trope is so damaging. I mean... I do recognize thought and behavioral patterns that a poorly done damsel in distress trope can bring up but that cant happen in a vacuum. Theres way more things leading to those than just one trope.The patterns being if I help himher out theyll like me more and I should always help them no matter what. For someone insecure these patterns are enticing as they almost give a sense of control over how others think of them. Except when they dont leading to a horrible disappointment and sometimes selfloathing.Most of that comes from the rest of the environment and upbringing so the tropes sort of just confirm it to the people who cant think these things through that well yet. However I dont think that getting rid of the trope is the answer. Focusing on the upbringing is way more important.Heck most of the actual abusive twitter crapflinging seems to come from kids whose parents have let them do pretty much whatever they want on the internet and I think that is a big problem. If kids are just given their tablets and pcs for the evening and left completely unobserved while the adults have better things to do I dont really expect things to go well for them in the future.Ive been thinking about blogging about all of this and more and sometimes I see GG skirting around some of these issues while not actually realizing the real issues.Oh and just for the credibility. Im studying community education in university and also have studies in psychology and solutionoriented psychotherapy while my SO has her masters in psychology.

3079053,0,t3_2vf023,While I usually agree with TB in regards to mechanics I disagree with his opinion of the skill trees. I dont see much creativity or innovation. In the video  TB mentions the following skills Reduce damage taken Ground execute stomp Craft unlock lockpicks firecrackers throwing stars and molotovs Extra backpack space TB points out this is not that interesting Improved Repair Melee chance to stun Kick chance to stun Charge attack Damage bonus per hit Ability to Dodge Better freerunning Less fall damage TB points out this is not that interesting Health regeneration  Shake off Biters fasterNone of these are new interesting or change how the game mechanically plays. While it can be argued that unlocking the tools the chance to stun the ability to dodge and the charge attack do somewhat change the game I believe these are things often included in other games within either their progression unlocks or from the very start.I have left out five skills he mentions because they dont seem entirely boring. The first two elemental throwing stars and grenades are a little interesting. While they do change how the equipment performs it seems these skills simply improve the equipments damage. The remaining three are the grappling hook the slide and the Backlash skill. I believe these are genuinely interesting and change how the game is played. Each of these either open up an entire new avenue of gameplay or offer up new options for interfacing with the game.I see a lot of similarities between these skills and those in Borderlands. Chance to stun health regeneration and ability to dodge for example. I agree that Borderlands skills are in the majority boring and I think uHelarc is right when he says that the  increments are a shitty reward for hours of gameplay. What Borderlands does really well is with the mid and top tier skills these are the ones that you can only put a single skill point into. These often go well beyond generic bonuses and result in a change in gun or skill mechanics. It seems that Borderlands suffers due to the number of skills it offers. In order to give you a skill point every level every skill tree is littered with the  skills. In Dying Light there arent any of the  skills which is good. Meanwhile there arent very many compelling skills which is unfortunate. TB gave me the impression that the skill tree was something to be impressed by and I felt it was lackluster. I would like to point out that I have not played the game nor have I researched the skill trees. I wanted to give my opinion entirely based upon video. I would appreciate input from someone that has made it to the end of the trees on whether or not the trees continue with more skills like Backlash or they fall back upon simple passive changes. tldr TB likes skill tree I think its mediocre ,Cynicalbrit,coh53t0,5,t5_2tqbt

3148192,0,t1_coo5l60,I think it does affect the game. Well mostly depending on what game. I dont like the notion that mechanics and story and such is the only thing that changes the game. Lets take an extreme example. The Sims. In the Sims the cosmetics is a very important part of the game. Would you argue that you lose nothing in the Sims by having one style of clothing for all the sims? I dont think so. So in that instance having clothes DLC on day one is really bad practice. But as I said its an extreme example since its actually an undisputed part of the game to customize the character.In Evolve its a bit different because customization is not a part of the base game at all as far as Im concerned. So in that case you dont lose as much. But I still think that cosmetics is important here as well. Its like selling a book with a weird font but you can pay extra to get the book with a better font. But you dont lose any of the story of the book. No. But part of the reading experience is if the text is pleasant to look at.Then we have middle of the road cosmetics. Most RPG games has character customization. In those games the customization is an important part of the game and it is often part of the deal. But its not purely down to the looks since the stats is often more important. But even without buying power in an RPG I think its an important part.,Cynicalbrit,coob23r,2,t5_2tqbt

3196701,0,t1_cot1cev,One big issue is that installing that fresh windows legally on pre build machine is really fucking hard these days. I remember I could easily install XP or Vista with product key found at back of computer with some retail disc no problem but last year I got new computer for my sister so product key is actually inside computer now and trying to install from retail disc doesnt work that easily. Even installing . with  key is pain as they want me to install  first and using microsoft account to download update even though its free update... I remember many computers had recovery discs with them with XP and Vista preinstalled then I remember they had to be burned manually when I was working at computer repairing but when I got to that point with my sisters computer  I researched two fucking days and couldnt make recovery media at all! I did find out that it should be USB these days of course and that there was that option on earlier manufacturers laptop but for some reason its removed on windows  machines. So I cant even install that version of OS with all the crapware if anything goes wrong. Of course I could always buy expensive lisence install illegal version or linux but its so much fucking work so its easier to just try uninstall annoying shit and move on. Maybe the problem is that all laptops are pre built avoiding crap and bloatware is really hard. I know many switching to tablets because of all that but now many phones and tablets have been starting to get their share of crap and bloatware as well and they are even harder to uninstall as manufacturers install them as system software. Many Samsung phones keep up with Yahoo stocks in background for example draining battery and resources I just hope there will be Nexus kind of phones in future with clean android. ,Cynicalbrit,cotc6a0,4,t5_2tqbt

Games are either amazing good enough or dont waste my money according to your opinions. I am careful to take your opinions with a grain of salt and know that there are some genres that I will love no matter what. Dying light was an interesting one. Sure I watched videos and twitch streams for it but I wanted to absolutely make sure that it was a good enough port and that the game would be compelling enough to play. The port report gave me hope and the wtf is... made it good enough to buy. ANY game I have bough based on opinions from you has ALWAYS been worth worth the money. Thank you for the buyers guide and indepth format as no one else focuses on it. Keep doing what you are doing and I hope to continue watching wtf is... long into the future.Also sorry to mention this but Im waiting on the CitiesSkylines wft is... video before I buy it so hopefully that is out this week.

Theres really a few ways to fight back.  For the most of us ignoring these people is the best.  But if youre one that is supposedly represented by these sorts of extremists and find this despicable or just wrong i.e. a woman or minority that finds the opposing argument just bullshit you can make an active fight and call the extremists out.And if its slander or libel or whatnot?  Id say take people to court if its possible.TB has gone as far as to call some of these sorts of critics academics.

Oh and I know incest was fairly common in the Egyptian pharoah line depending on whom was leading at the time.  Such as Cleopatra was with her brother prior to Julius Ceasar swooping in on her although my knowledge of Egypt is pretty limited.However interestingly being genetically similar has also been linked to increased attraction provided the relationship wasnt known about.

You can use your voice or your phone to turn on your Xbox which will turn on your TV and sound system and change volume etc. Its at face value silly to be so happy about replacing a remote but once its a part of the flow you really appreciate it.For servers theyre nice when they work. Titanfall has jaded me to PP online. Also Crackdown has potential so Im optimistic. If cloud processing works it could be revolutionary.The media features are awesome I can watch OTA TV with a voice powered integrated guide or I can stream the screen to my SOs tablet while I go play a game. Or soon with Windows  I can just stream the game to my tablet and play wherever.People who dont use these features or dont use the console wont notice these things but they are an incredible improvement on how I experience the Xbox One over the .

3780064,0,t3_33n1oa,Ive been making mods since Sims  days.  Made a lot heavily back then since I was young and shared them freely.  Sims  rolled around.  I converted a handful of stuff and shared freely.  But the plague that was surrounding Sims modding since even the first one was the terrible paywall VIP websites.  I still think they are partly the reason that MaxisEA decided to make modding harder and harder.  There has always been big databases of files on the internet that people put the paywall sites files on since they are so against it.  Needless to say I had a hard time with people stealing my work and putting it up on other paywall sites.  Half the time I couldnt even get into the sites without paying to actually even find them.  It really kind of spoiled the feeling of sharing for me.  On the topic of Skyrim Ive made a handful of mods.  Mostly personal stuff like texture changes and some followers and shared among friends.  If someone asks about it I gladly share it with them but havent openly shared it since I had the bad time with previous modding.  I was actually highly considering uploading a lot of my stuff since Im pretty much done altering it all at this point and it probably is done as it will ever be.  But now Im wary of stealing again.Overall I love to donate to modders I love.  Even more so if they are doing something incredibly timeconsuming.  I know how much effort it can take to put into some of that stuff.  I can totally understand someone saying hey I need donations in order to continue this mod in a timely manner and seen many people get banned from Skyrims Nexus for asking for money to help support them.  But you could donate just could not actively ask for money for a mod.  It was some strange lingo with Bethesda.  The fact that ValveBeth deems they need to take a large chunk of it I understand they need to take some of it due to resources and such but it feels like it should be the other way around.   to creator.   to valvebeth.  Either way Id rather donate directly to a modder to support them.Im more so scared of Steams history of QA and people stealing free mods and putting them up for money.  Id say it may be pretty hard to prove a person is who they say they are due to variations of usernames across websites.  So things are a bit iffy there.  I cant imagine the claims that will come rolling in.  For either mod resources used in a mod unwillingly that is being charged for or just straight up stealing.Anyways workshop sucks butt for Skyrim mods anyways.  Skyrim is so wonky you need to have direct control over some of that stuff pretty good to keep from a lot of game breaking. I can see some benefits to this of course.  If it means more games will allow modding in the future that could be a benefit.  But Id hate to have to consider  extra for mods for every game I purchase.  Excluding DLC.  Id just be concerned game developers would not totally put all their effort into a game as much if they can just sit back and say a modder will fix itdo it.  I mean people have been claiming that Bethesda has been doing that with their games since Oblivion if not even before that.  Edit Sorry if this seems convoluted.

But people took it upon themself to defend the modders rights which they never asked for. And the whole modders cut question was one of the biggest drive of the loud roving mob and was a complete scapegoat.

3857564,0,t3_3438ec,These are my thoughts on the current problems with Steams shitty ass system If the goal is to share revenue with modders let them have the lions share of the cut. In this case Valve and Beth arent doing shit and Valve obv didnt put any resources on vetting and customer service so why the F are they getting ? Minus taxes and other fees the  modders were gonna receive was almost nonexistent.   AnnoywareWhat got Steam users riled up was due to unscrupulous individuals putting their reskinned weapons with crap textures or whatever for sale for  dollars. If everyone who put their mods up for sale where high quality mods like Purity then I doubt the backlash wouldve been this big. This ties into Valve who shouldve put some sort of vetting process before you can put your mod up for sale instead of allowing everyone to put anything they want for sale.then taking the lions share of the cut without doing anything complaint .  Customer serviceMods have no previous expectations due to them being free I mean if a mod breaks and the modder is too busy with life then tough luck. On the other hand if you paid for something there is an expectation it will work forever so if a mod breaks and the only recourse is to ask the modder nicely then no way should anyone pay a dollar for this system. I doubt anyone really has an issue of modders being paid for their work I mean DoTa and TF already have such people and nobody is up in arms about those. But there needs to be a better system and implementation from ValveSteam. If Valve doesnt want to put any  into vettingcuration and customer service then they should just implement a donate button. Donation is a form of selfregulation by the market people will select who they think is worthy of their  and give an amount that they think is appropriate or what they can afford. ,Cynicalbrit,cqvzxcw,1,t5_2tqbt

3881183,0,t1_cqybhdb,Honestly I think paid mods will only ever work and not have a gigantic community backlash if they are handled in a way that the only mods that are ever given the pay wall are ones that are reviewed and approved by the company who created the game and deem the mod of quality. The big problem with a lot of the paid mod talk is that in my experience at least that when you bring up heavy and iron fisted curation people say that is too strict and that the point of the program is to encourage new modders into the scene. However all that kind of curation does is enforce a level of professional standards. Which is  fair as the moment you sell your product you are expected to not create amateur level work and to make professional level products. It seems some of the people that are for pay walled mods want for mod authors to be paid like professionals without being held to the same quality standards as professionals. If it isnt high enough quality for the company that made the game to put out then it shouldnt be allowed to be put behind a pay wall simple as that. I dont mind paid mods if they are of the quality of DLC and are professionally made by someone who is really good and then approved by the company that made the game making them accountable for anything bad they let through. However I am  against them if any amateur is going to be allowed to put stuff up without heavy curation. However this also comes with the note that any fix mods like patches and UI fixes not go through. Other than patches which are free and simply made part of an official update as it is the companys responsibility to fix the game and no one should be allowed to charge for that. If you want to fix it for them then go ahead and you are allowed to ask donations however you should never be allowed to pay wall. Any fixing is a charity to the community not a fast way to cash in on the developers laziness. ,Cynicalbrit,cqyosjg,3,t5_2tqbt

3965764,0,t1_cr8brdd,The alternative that games use is to use the standard GPU shaders to do calculations. Voxel Cone Traced global illumination voxelises the world with GLSL graphics shaders writing to a D texture the alternative there would have been to use OpenCLCUDA to write to a D data array but it just so happens that a D texture is just as good and the technique fits the GPU pipeline nicely.id Tech  uses CPU threads to do tasks that could have otherwise been done on the GPU as the PS version of id Tech  actually uses the Cell SPUs to do some of these tasks The PSs SPUs are a bit like GPU shader cores in how parallelism is performed.The nonPS versions of id Tech  will perform full image analysis of a smaller version of the frame on CPU threads the engine actually draws the world twice the first time is to a small image buffer for analysing what textures are needed at what resolution the nd time is what the player sees.The analysis could have been done on OpenCLCUDA in the same way it was done on the PS SPUs but CPU threads are instead used. Theres less cores compared to a stream processor like Cell or a GPU but it gets the job done within the .ms time window.The most common thing is particle systems CUDAOpenCL is perfect for particle system and weve seen lots of examples of that but you can also do them in the GPU shader using geometry shaders to create the particle cluster.

American culture is very individualistic and it can make for some very strong very one sided opinions. I try not to take the power free speech has for granted but some of my fellow Americans do not indulge in such self discipline....some though not all.

Its not a problem just weird as keeping NVIDIA experiences FPS counter doesnt do the same and that thing wants to count everything and an annoyance if these things annoy you so its something to know if you keep your eye on temps and of course you dont have keep it on background you can just load it with a game.

4869013,0,t3_3hl1gl,I really dont get why people are so hard against Day One DLCs at all. I understand that this comes from the view that the companys want to sell them something that could already be in the normal game but there are  in my opinion  some points that should be mentioned as well. Leaving downloads aside most of the games have to be finished weeks before their actual launch day. Pressing discs and shipping them is nothing that happens over one night and after the team has practically nothing to do. And even before that therell be always parts of the team who are finished way earlier than over parts. Most times the graphical assets will be finished way before the AI balance campaign or other things. Using this free time to add DLCContent that can be bought on Day One is one of the easiest ways to use this free time and still generate money.That aside selling DLCs on Day One is from the sellers standpoint the best way to go because your audience is the biggest at the starting point of the hype. Looking at how some games becomes old after just a few weeks selling these DLCs later means less people who are still playing this game less people who are willing to restart the game and less people who will actually buy the DLC for that purpose. Besides the whole They are selling us something that could have been on the discargument selling DLCs on the launch day should be the best for both the companies and the players.And even if some of the content could be available from the start that doesnt mean it should be. Companies  especially small ones  have to calculate and so pushing that much content in a game to the point where some of the points that should be in the game cant be justified with the price of the game itself. Pure hypothetical  instead of selling . DLCs for  Euro one would need to sell . more  Euro games which can be way more harder. I personally compare Day One DLCs with the overlength extra in cinemas. You want more game so you have to pay for the more of the content. The only difference with games I have the choice whether I want to buy this extra content or not. If I dont want to buy it I simply dont buy it. If I need a flashy skin for the character because it looks cool I will pay for it. Nobody is forced to buy Day One DLCs...Companies and their final products should never be rated because of the existence of Day One DLCs. Just do the same as you have always done. Look at the content you get and look at the price. Enough content without Day One DLC? Maybe a reason to buy it. Not enough content without Day One DLC? Then just dont buy the game or wait until the price matches your view. I would have no problem with buying a  Euro single player campaign for a shooter where most of the audience just wants the multiplayer. And yeah I would buy it on Day One if the prices of both products match my expectations. If not  like with borderlands  Ill wait some months and buy it for like . Im the consumer nobody is forcing me and some of the companies are just shit no matter what they do.But it is just sad that we use some of the worst examples of companies to demonize Day One DLCs which could  done right  be a blessing for both smallmiddle companies and the gamers. We shouldnt criticise a method itself... we should just criticise the realisation for each different case...,Cynicalbrit,cu89y7b,4,t5_2tqbt

If I say Laura Ks voice makes her unwatchable Im just stating an opinion about her role as a personality online. I gotta say people need to look past the face value of statements and either ask for clarification or assume better of people. I cannot stand the outrage culture and the fact that making disparaging remarks about someone is immediately an assault on their identity and entire demographic is something that does social justice a large disservice. It turns the internet off to their ideas.Its the same kind of thing that happening to Black Lives Matter. They verbally abused Bernie Sanders a man who marched with Dr. King and told him he hasnt done enough to prove hes on the side of African Americans.

They had no control over the sound setup. TB got mad about community for bullying child people were bitching about the poor kid. He had every right to express his opinion. Should he have? Probably not. But I would have found it hard to not chastise the people in that thread because they were complaining about a minor distraction and were kind of attacking the poor girls character. He probably should have had an age restriction but moving forward Im sure they will. and the drama with subreddit mods this is really no ones fault because the moderation system for reddit sucks and because TB quit reddit their was not a proper chain of commandcommunication. Its everyones and no ones fault as I see it.So whos really blowing this issue out of proportion? We all are. The only wrong doing was the bitching at that poor little girl.Its agreed that TB should stay sway from social media but people are making them seem crazier than they are. Twitter is horrendous for discussion so its alarming to see so many astute psychological evaluation s based on social media posts. Also their whole livelyhood is on the line.

Usually config file in windows registry by default then only consists of resolution windowed and preset number. Have been looking into Unity games that have stuff locked to  FPS making it look super stuttery on over Hz monitors.

I believe he made mention of it in his WTF for VI as well.As far as graphics go the animations and such are obviously worse than those used in VI while VII reuses a lot of its assets. This makes very little sense. Aside from that TB made the point that the stained glass aesthetic actually looks really nice which I agree with but the rest of the visuals around it just seem very lackluster as if they were tossed in at the last moment. It has the potential to be a very pretty minimalist iteration but at it stands all it is is minimalist and not a whole lot of pretty.I agree with uAriescz in that HoMM looks great because its art style is timeless. VII could have gone in that direction but lost its focus somewhere in development and never got it back. if you look at the towns theyre very well done and remind me of the landscape mattepaintinglike town screens in .

5397136,0,t3_3ox4js,Since I found out about this earlier today Ive been trying to wrap my mind around this and find a way to collect my thoughts.And I cant. My thoughts are too chaotic at this point to contain.Part of thats because in the last few years it seems like my lifes been surrounded by nothing but death. Not only in my personal life but major heroes of mine passing away. People I just assumed would be around for ever. When youre someone like me you dont have much strength of your own. These people that Ive admired who have past have been that strength for me given me that resolve to keep pushing forward when I couldnt. And so it is this news that hits me the hardest. Unbeknownst to you and for the longest time now youve embodied a large number of features that I aspire to. Not just as some content creator on youtube but as a person. I have no doubt that you being in my life for the last six years even in this small way has permanently shaped me to be the man I am today  someone who others evidently like. Even if that person you are on youtube is just a persona a facade its one that I hold in high regard. Youve inspired me more than perhaps anyone in my entire life because even though you like to keep yourself distant you feel so relateable to me that I cant help but aspire to be more like you even though Ive long left my impressionable years.I have no right to cast this burden on you and so its something Ive never said. Ive opted as many others to take the silent path. When you gave your announcement a year ago I was shocked but calmed by the way you seemed to handle things.But I cant simply sit idly by with the feeling that I may never have a chance to say anything. And thats a shitty thing to think at this present time. But Id feel shittier still if I continued to say nothing.Im sorry if this all comes off as narcissistic. Youre just a very important part of my life because you keep me honest and strong when others cant. When I cant.I really hope you get better and that maybe this is all a fluke or something you can get past and still be happy and healthy at the end. I know that might not be the appropriate thing to say in a situation like this because of the nature of the situation  it might be insulting even. But Id be lying if I said that wasnt my wish. Id be lying if I said I didnt want you to be perfectly happy despite all this.If anyone deserves a calm healthy and happy life at this point its you goddammit.,Cynicalbrit,cw1jlct,1,t5_2tqbt

Felicia was just fine with the whole thing and went on to be good friends with Jesse nowadays.Im not taking offense and I never said Felicia wasnt alright with it. The commenter above me mentioned that professionals can handle it if they dont like something. Which does not pertain to my original point honestly but would still an uninviting attitude to display from a host Doesnt matter if the guest doesnt like it Ill start with it whether they like it or not theyre professionals. Again I dont think Jesse thought along those lines.gt Besides which even if they hadnt gone on to be friends there was nothing cringey about it he plays it off perfectly well for laughs and it comes off as a deliberate comedy bit and hilarious. Playing uncomfortable situations for laughs is par for the course in doing podcasts and shows and being an entertaining personality in general it happens all the time and is part of the job basically.If you didnt think it was cringey thats fine. Your opinion seems to be shared by most of the people in this sub. Playing uncomfortable situations for laughs is of course part of comedy but I thought this one missed its mark. I thought it was too much I thought it was cringey and I remember I had to avert my gaze when I watched it.gt Your putting someone in that situation is a dick move mindset is the mindset of someone on the outside looking in who imagines that they know what being professional is all about but doesnt really have a clue of the context. Maybe in a cubiclesitting suitandtie office type of job what you say is true but in podcasts and comedy? No.Id like to know which podcasts and comedy youre thinking about because Im having a hard time believing that this is often done at the start of an episode. Yes In any longerrunning podcast theres bound to be some episodes where a bigger star comes on and everyone is very excited. And during the episode one of the hosts tells a story about his past experiences as a fan of the guest and it gets quite involved and even a bit spiced up for comedic effect. But thats during the episode after the introduction not right at the start. You break out the ridiculous personal stories once everybody has had a chance to settle in. When its clear that youre not really like that youre just being awkward for comedic effect.,Cynicalbrit,cwpja6y,-7,t5_2tqbt

If not then theres good reason for the industry to improve on that.eeeeeh im not ok with that statement.the more correct one would be does the benefit of developing these games outweigh the riskcost?gtIf you just want to play your vidya thats cool as well.the thing is i havent been able to do this at all in recent years what with all the political crap infecting gaming.the attempts to bring all sorts of politics into games especially AAAs not to mention the insane greed thats attached to that nowadays has meant there were very few games that were actually worth buying... my hobby is slowly but surely losing its appeal to me.its one of the reasons i follow tb. he finds gems others overlook. not to mention that he has a very similar taste to me in many respects so i do benefit from that.i just wish companies wouldnt try to wedge diversity in everywhere as a selling point S. if your game is good noone cares if its diverse enough.,Cynicalbrit,cxcz36y,5,t5_2tqbt

6027907,0,t1_cy9rxv2,gt  Overkill already had plenty of money they did not need even more they got greedy and stupid and people pushed back its really that simple.And this is why you are ultimately a lost cause. You have absolutely zero understanding of any economic concepts and you certainly have zero understanding of the games industry. Game content does not grow on magical content trees. It costs money to develop. Saying that because a developer made X amount of money in the past that they now are arbitrarily Greedy for making more money is idiotic. Complaining about content developed postrelease and then sold with a price tag is idiotic. Their choices are to either stop developing the game develop the game and give away content for free This kills the company unless they are in an extremely fortuitous situation or develop the game and sell the content. There is no fourth option.So your above comment can only be interpreted in two ways. Either you dislike content or you have a childlike understanding of the world to the point that you are posting idiotic bullshit like this.

6029051,0,t3_3y1tgl,Ok lets do it.TB has a personality that sadly in a way feed on negativity. The way I see it and I know Im not in his head when shit goes wrong in his head or his life he has a tendency to actively seek negativity around him in a self inflicting way. Thats a bad quirk of his personality that more than anything harm him along the way. What most people got to do as much as possible is take this perspective when he found something that upset him with his fans. Sometimes it is innocents criticism on their behalf sometimes its just shit and giggles from random asshole either way the way he act upon it is sometime I think deep down very emotional but rarely really aimed to others. Personal issues and shit.The part about your .... PGM skillfulness doesnt make any sense. Does Roger Ebert needed do be a great film director to critic a movie ? Do you thing that your personal skill can make a game going from shitshow to masterpiece ? That you love for instance plateformers or sports game and cant find in TB a profoundly useful critic I can understand at least the man doesnt love those games most of the time and as a result very rarely cover them but for the rest this mindset of yours seems totally irrelevant and comes borderline lolz Im such hardcore now.The last point at least I can understand. There is restraint in TB regarding his own fandom restraint that is indeed in big part coming from his own uneasiness from having such things as fans which I can totally understand. Must feel weird sometimes even if he seems to enjoy a lot meeting those fans at the same time. What people get out of his content is not up to him at the same time. Sometime the emotional construct that people came up with make only sense with only there own context. It can be personal drama or simple loneliness or a lot of other things but in the end a lot of people will be grateful to have something filling their life when things go wrong. It can be a song a movie a friend or yes a simple Youtuber. How people react to that in the end takes a lot of variety. Some will simply give their sympathy and as long as this person is in their minds worthy of it their respect. Other will go full fanboy indeed. TB has control on what he release and says. But he has none about how people react. TB audience and by extension those who have subscribed here are not a unified hivemind and if I can understand where youre coming from here I still think that you fooled yourself in understanding how people mind work and what a big part of your readers are themselves. ,Cynicalbrit,cy9xf94,2,t5_2tqbt

6347198,0,t1_czb391u,Fair enough  Theres actually something different I want to bring up. Maybe it shouldnt be a rule especially considering your comments on free speech etc or get implemented but its something I wish people would remember. I come from the art community whatever that is haha and anyone involved in posting art online regardless of fan base size gets unsolicited criticism and I tell you what its the most irritating thing in the world. At first you welcome it it makes you improve and forces you to try harder. Then you start having bad days or you make work that comes from somewhere deeper closer to your heart. You worked really really hard and you know theres a few things you could fix a few days later you start spotting some mistakes but you made it and you gifted it to the world. You didnt make it as a statement or to be the best thing ever maybe you even decided to try out new techniques or ignore classic technique all together. Then it starts. Random person on Twitter I hate you your style sucks you should stop drawing Reddit I can see why you did that but critically it would be much better if you did this other thing Facebook why do you always do this?! You always draw girls have some diversity why dont you relate it to MY experience by drawing different body shapesyou get the point. In most communities we can choose to state looking for constructive criticism or the equivalent. Suddenly it is not unsolicited. It feels like you invited the questioning rather than being subjected to it. It also means that if you havent stated that you want cc then people are less inclined to give it to you. Most people understand that you dont want criticism on that particular piece or at that particular time when you are going through some life troubles or struggling with artist block. In the YouTube world there is this expectation that people comment on everything. That you can nitpick or critique on anything you want. And yes free speech is a thing and therefore you can. But these people are still artists who make entertainment and literature for us. And so perhaps they should be allowed the same courteous respect that artists with a paintbrush are given. I like to critique especially if I feel it will improve another artists work. But TB turned off his comment section in YouTube and I guess I subconsciously took that as a Do not critique comment. I know there were completely different reasons for it as well.I guess what Im trying to say is this criticism IS useful if you are looking for it. But when it slaps you in the face no matter how beautifully written it can drive you up the wall especially when you are struggling with real life troubles too I know Ive been in tears from the most random of comments because I was having IRL health issues and I was well scared. I didnt want someone telling me that both my job and my hobby were flawed. I cant imagine how hard it must be having this big of a fanbase and having to read all of that regardless of whether your emotions or reasoning are rational or not at the time. ,Cynicalbrit,czb3tie,3,t5_2tqbt

But even in the more mechanics focused RoguelikesRoguelites you still have to make the decision whether to explore more or progress to the next level sooner. My point is that Permadeath changes the way you approach these riskreward mechanics. Save states or checkpoints allow for more exploration in a shorter time frame because you dont lose a lot of progress even when you fail. Permadeath on the other hand forces you to rethink your decisions twice and that is a design aspect fairly unique to Roguelites.,Cynicalbrit,cze797y,1,t5_2tqbt

6423658,0,t3_43oinb,I also would like to see this game being more realistic and I also find it silly that there is different AK rifles with different levels that do different damage and etc. However here is arguments I have against TB position on this.. Ok its maybe more suitable for scifi game or fantasy game. But here is point there is already enough such games I think there is nothing wrong for someone to make at least one bulletsponge rpg loot game in more realistic setting because not everyone likes scifi or fantasy. Or maybe people are bored of scifi and fantasy.. Making damage too realistic can indeed make games less fun and indeed turn it from RPG into something else. It can even decrees tactical aspect yes its strange but unrealistic damage model and high HP can make game more tacticalHonestly look at hardcore mode in Battlefield or in COD. Its not really fun when you run for  min and then you got killed by someone with one hit and you cant even do anything. It decreases the tactical aspect since you cant use cover etc too much. Because in case when you can get few hits and still be alive you can try to hide behind some cover try to out flank enemy shooting you. But when you are killed with very few hits you just have no chance to do this because you have less time between moment when you spot enemy and when you are dead. Especially if you consider game having some abilities you will have less opportunities for teamfight and use of these abilities. But it also maybe not a problem of game being realistic or having less shots to kill but because people who made BF and COD hardcore modes didnt balance it for example with weapon being less accurate or by making aim weapon more hard. Or at least not making player dying instantly by being hit in the toe with sniper rifle. So maybe there is some place for some good balance and RPG like tactical fight even with few shots to kill. But in any case its not even truly realistic because there is no HP in real life and people dont die instantly if you hit them in the toe or hand just because it was enough to lower someones HP. So maybe its ok to have this abstract damage models.This is interesting topic and I think there is place for interesting game design solutions how to make realistic yet fun games but truth is no game is perfect and there are disadvantages of one shot kill damage model.. There is maybe no easy way to make loot different if game that has levels and if it tries to be this classic MMORPG.You need to make low level attachment to add   bonuses. You need to make different versions of guns for different levels. And even in game like Battlefield I think most of these attachments are also boring. And this is indeed where making it scifi or fantasy would make it more authentic. But again see argument .Same case with NPC enemies having large number of HP how you would make levels without high level enemies having high HP. Imagine you are level  and you go to sector with level  enemies what is point if you just can kill them with one shot to the head? Of course one can think for some solution for this for example make levels less significant element of game and make higher level enemies wear body armor and some helmet face mask but this would not necessary bee this classic MMORPG then. And again see argument . People deserve to have at least one WoW like game but in modern time with some realism. P.S.I didnt played Destiny but this game reminded me Defiance more and Defiance was somehow similar to Borderlands  And Im more sad not because of bulletsponge aspect but because its another MMORPG with instances. I would really like to see MMORPG with real living world when everyone have same state of the world and shared quests.,Cynicalbrit,czjqr6h,1,t5_2tqbt

Problems arouse when the only people that knew about this barebones version was the hardcore fighting game crowd in other words the people the game targeted at launch.Capcom didnt communicate the lack of content properly to the more casual players via trailers etc. and normal person didnt do any research.

6663300,0,t1_d08ig3v,Yeah my point was that Zangief is in no way applicable for this discussion.Ryu and Ken are much more appropriate  muscular but not some hulking monstrosities manly and still handsome... So in that sense you have a much better argument that there is a appealing to the female gaze going on with them.However Id STILL maintain that that is not the case with them They are designed to be the cover art characters and honestly somewhat generic for the purposes of the player being able to project themselves onto them.Unlike with Zangief there is probably some small element of appealing to the female gaze but again it is not a primary one.Meanwhile with something like Cammys updated design or ChunLis Preorder Costume... Yeah...Mind you ChunLis costume although REALLY revealing is still just a costume Dont get me wrong  I dont actually have a problem with sexy. Sexy is fine.A character or a skin can be sexy in terms of their concept and design That is fine. Im not some prude The only times I say that sexy is bad is when it is a totally out of place or b totally forced.Thus my issue is when sexy becomes the only or primary element for many characters regardless of their personal and sometimes historic design...So changing Cammy to what she looks like now...

7212995,0,t1_d1x3s64,I completely agree with everything you just said but that was not what my post is about. Its more about the egg  hen problematic. There is no reason to support Linux for most publisher since everybody that cares really about games in contrast to having to buying a game once in a while mainly because of a pro Linux agenda or at least saying so will dual boot to Windows if necessary.gt F one could choose operating system based on their respective strengths and weaknesses and not on available software would that not be a better world in what comes to the IT industry?Definitive! At the same time though realistically if multiple OS shared compatibility for native code across each other they would need to share many characteristics of each other as well. In the end you would end up that represents the different OEM versions and forks of Android more than anything else. And compared to this Windows is still very customisable for most use cases and users. I mean you arent forced to use the default Windows command line file explorer start menu or even general GUI  for most uses Windows is already pretty open to gt Id say the most constructive opinion one that all of us should have is that it would be best if there were alternatives avoiding a monopoly.Problem is that this is a high concept that doesnt directly translate into a feature list.

7219259,0,t1_d1yr6a8,While I do not think it is a black and white area I do not think them reverse engineering stuff helps in any way. Honestly I would be suprised if their EULA hasnt mentioned this from the start. Luckily EULAs are not the law. Anyway I think a stronger point would be from a educationalconservational perspective. They could try to work out some education based defence where this notforprofit argument could fit in. On its own notforprofit is a flimsy defence as it could still be considered commercial use. Large scale operation and could be considered to interfere with Blizzards current commercial products.The internet archive and EFF were making some progress at defeating copy protections which would usually violate the DMCA for a small set of historical conservation scenarios. For Nostalrius it is too late maybe it is even too late for WoW but I hope with these clear examples can get some momentum going to figure out legal devices for more complex historical videogames as well. It is clear that most companies are out of touch with their surrounding culture and they indicate themselves they are not in a position to provide these kinds of services. I can understand Blizzard as a  company not wanting to compete with their own products even more as their IPs already have a tendency of doing that... but they clearly do not understand their fans for a long while now. So in this case I feel we need to give other people the oppurtunity some legal framework to fill this gap.It is just so sad when you look over at Jagex and can just get RuneScape in pretty much any flavor youd like it.,Cynicalbrit,d1yrvz2,1,t5_2tqbt

7469710,0,t1_d2r4v16,gt Its not that he necessarily minds losing its more that hes getting the same repeated game over and over.My complaint isnt that hes upset about the lack of variety in opponents decks though. Its a given that when Blizzard gave all players Cthun so everyone should be able to make at least a half decent deck that is fairly straight forward and solid you would see a lot of Cthun decks especially at lower ranks where fewer players have a ton of cards. It of course means that a lot of people will play that type of deck but I think that negative is outweighed by the positive of giving more players a better start for their experience with the game.My complaint was that TB in this video constantly is whining about how strong Cthun decks are how ridiculously strong it is and all that. It really isnt the case and I can guarantee that he would have a very different experience if he didnt go so far off the beaten path. To do a silly analogy TB is trying to play football in a space suit.

7494833,0,t1_d2u386z,And youre starting with the assumption that Blizzard doesnt give a fuck about Battleborn. However you did not present anything to support that. I laid out times actions that would support that they intentionally set dates that would pull attention away from competition and that they had the means to do it as well as the motivation. If its not clear to you the motivation is that they are getting as much media attention as possible to support their launch. If nothing else they would want to maximize market exposure at the expense of overshadowing other games.I havent made any argument as to the quality of the games and since I have not experienced both I will not say anything about it. Youre making an argument about the quality of the game rather than the marketing which is the focus of the argument. However you are wrong in that there is nothing to lose. Any game needs marketing of some sort and failing to reach the market which is the issue here for one reason or another is detrimental to the game.I honestly dont know if youre trying to convince me or anyone.

7805729,1,t1_d3t8y47,Very true that seems to go against TBs anticonsumer stance. I really dont care about microtransactions in free to play gamesthat arent on mobile like Warframe or in lowerpriced games like Killing Floor  and CS GO but I have a real problem with them in fullpriced games like Overwatch Rainbow Six Siege Battlefront COD and Destiny. I dont give a flying fuck if theyre cosmetic or not they still create a system of haves and have nots sooner or later TB will have to face the music on this subject whether he wants to or not.His stances in favor of online passes and against used games also struck me as anticonsumer.Your post is mostly wellwritten though if I was you id refrain from calling people who criticize microtransactions in Overwatch idiots as that makes you sound a bit condescending.  The way I see it microtransactions have been forced on people in so many games by this point that now even cosmetic stuff pisses people off so its not the fault of the consumer its the fault of the industry for trying to nickle and dime people to death so I dont think being against them is being an idiot people are just being wary anytime they hear a  dollar game is going to have microtransactions and I think they have very good reasons for being cautious. ,Cynicalbrit,d3tfc9q,5,t5_2tqbt

They can change the event maybe rotate Lucioball in at some point add a handful of new rewards and call it a day.WoW has done this for years with seasonal events.

I think a lot of the people here are complaining about nothing but to say that the people on the right are the privileged ones doesnt track. If you look at the movements and the people the left leaning movements usually come from Colleges where theres a lot of rich people with time to waste and people who would rather point the finger at things like race and gender instead of the higher class that theyre usually a part of. Most of the people Ive seen on the other side are the working class who get insulted for not conforming to the group think.,Cynicalbrit,dd9gmuu,10,t5_2tqbt

Surely thats a fallacy of relative privation well thats bad sure but they have it worse in Africa the Rightwing so do something about that first or Ill ignore you. Surely it makes sense for someone to want to fix their own political side more than they want to attack the other since until your own side is not batshit insane its not a better prospect anyway.,Cynicalbrit,dda3ec2,15,t5_2tqbt

10615174,1,t1_ddalvfm,Ironically historical context taken out of context to fit snugly in to whatever narrative theyre trying to push at any given time.So you understand people being scared of hyperbole? I dont mainly because once you reach a certain level of logical capacity it becomes impossible to even empathetically remove that hard wiring in an age where the human psyche is understood to the point of personal manipulation being used by individuals to better themselves and alter how they react to things consciously and instinctively I will never understand people being this consistently stupid its curable and any human being not taking the neccesary steps to explore their weaknesses and destroy them is unfathomable to me.Its easy to assume the worst is going to happen in EVERY situation in life taking your kids to school crossing the road eating food brushing your teeth taking a shit going to sleep getting a blowie all of these could end badly and all of them probably have more RELEVANT historical context to use as a crutch for being a whiney snowflake but most people dont succumb to ludicrous hyperbole and prop it up as reality.I wish I could lower my intellect at the drop of a hat to engage with morons you have a special talent sir.You can be our man in the field the frontliner getting all the hot gossip straight from a downies mouth sound good?,Cynicalbrit,ddavibc,2,t5_2tqbt

10737644,0,t1_ddnha6u,I would want to see a link to that statement particularly since I want to make sure were discussing his actual statements.  Unfortunately TB has removed a number of his statements it seems as I couldnt find several myself.But leaving TB himself aside I would like to discuss that line of thought.  That statement is essentially saying I just want to virtue signal.  It is quite possibly the worst action you can take and I would point to recent events such as the Brexit vote and the US  elections as examples of what happens when an entire political side behaves in such a manner.In any political discussion most people will already have fairly strong opinions on the subject matter.  A minority of the audience wont have a strong opinion and an additional minority of each political side wont be particularly dogmatic.  If your speech is to be of any real benefit then in general you should be tailoring your speech to those individuals whom you could convince.If you are simply preaching to the choir then there are some pretty standard reactions.  You reaffirm the beliefs of both those who agree with and those who disagree with you often pulling each side to a greater degree of dogmatic belief.  You also generally dont interest those who dont have a particular care regarding the subject matter.  However if your arguments and beliefs are poorly presented or even worse are presented in a manner which offends others a common response is for others to be receptive to or adopt a position contradictory to your own.  Even if you are completely justified and correct in your opinion you will lose on the political battlefield if all youre doing is reaffirming your own base.  Look at how people reacted to Libertarians during the s when they discussed the drugwar.,Cynicalbrit,ddni9f4,9,t5_2tqbt

10790202,0,t3_5uawyo,Steam definitely makes recommendations based on simply what youve clicked on. I know this because when I clicked on Corpse Part or some random anime games because I like the image style I get recommendations for RPG Maker animestyle games that have nothing to do themewise or gameplaywise with any games that I own. This happens all the time and just makes me weary of clicking on any game... and sometimes I want to because the damn image looks cool which says NOTHING about the game and shouldnt be any indication of what should be recommended to me.Recommendations should be based on the time youve spent on certain types of games. If I spent  hours in an MMO sure recommend some MMOs if I spent ZERO hours on survival sandbox games DONT recommend that shit to me.EDIT Better yet provide a Add to Recommendations button on each games page to allow Steam to recommend similarlooking games and if you dont press it dont recommend games like it.,Cynicalbrit,ddsxlq2,10,t5_2tqbt

11771008,0,t1_dgu8ygp,Other Blizzard games might not work balancedesign wise when it comes to competitive but HotS is an exception.  Theres no rngluck factors to deal with in HotS outside of objective spawn locations many of which have easily understood patterns they follow.  While mechanics might be easier in terms of laningfarming a lot of the emphasis at high level is on the drafting and lane rotations to the point where a bad draft can lose you the game even if you have very strong characters on your team.  Blizzard even cares enough about the esports scene on a balance standpoint to leave Medivh at sub winrate overall just because he is so powerful in coordinated play.  Theres a similar situation with Tassadar shields and talents with them seeing constant changes because of his prevalence in the competitive scene.On the point of matches being ruined by shit players that just comes with the territory of having such a teamfocused game.  A game isnt objectively bad because it requires coordination between multiple players.  If you want to avoid that sort of thing it isnt too difficult to play as a man group.  In my experience HotS players are very open to partying up after a match were you randomly got thrown together.  All but  people on my friends list are groups I just randomly came across in solo queue and joined up with afterwards.,Cynicalbrit,dgu9wzz,6,t5_2tqbt

11807529,0,t1_dgwwk8m,gt Thats some of the best stuff!Yeah I know. Thats why I was so disappointed it  at least as far as Retribution went  seemed like it kinda deflated into nothing or at least wasnt relevant to what was going on.To be clear Im saying the super shady actions through DoW and  and the corruption in the chapter were great. I enjoyed them. What Im complaining about is that all that buildup at the time lead to a fairly bog standard resolution that didnt involve all the really interesting stuff like where they came from and who their primarch was. It didnt touch what Thule found on Kronus or why they were sent to purge the planet. It just picked up where Chaos Rising left off  the chapter master is a bad guy go stop him  and rolled out a fairly uninteresting resolution probably as a consequence of jettisoning most of DoWs cast and the general nagging feeling I had the whole time that the game was rushed.,Cynicalbrit,dgyfacl,1,t5_2tqbt
