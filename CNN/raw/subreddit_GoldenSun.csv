160422,0,t1_cewoxk5,Its something I thought of way back during my original play through of the first one.  Im actually surprised that no one has done it before.  I guess there isnt much a crossover of Golden Sun FansSailor Moon fansartists.,GoldenSun,cewpead,3,t5_2s75v

2809982,0,t3_2s6ygv,The lore is terrible. Instead of using civilizations like Anemos and Lemuria they added some new ones which had never been mentioned before.  Somehow cities have risen due to earthquakes and in almost all cases they are  horizontal with no damage. It doesnt make sense. They included some old cities like Bilibin but the majority are new. They added some lore about ancestors but how comes theyve never been mentioned before?Its basically like this game is saying the golden sun event has perfectly unearthed new cities new psynergy machines new lore etc. I feel like it was was a cheap way to make the game. They should have used things we already heard of in the past games like Ankohl. Maybe all the ancient civilisations we already know of have risen to power again? And new ruins have been slightly unearthed?A bad one is the last character you get. She gets visions which tell you where to go. What a lame way to advance the plot. They should have kept  characters and not crammed  into this one.,GoldenSun,cnnhihd,5,t5_2s75v

4027386,0,t3_36ku56,I can probably vouch for anyone here that if you really loved the first two games then you owe it to yourself to do the rd. Regardless of how it fared against the first two it was a continuation of a beautiful story while making a new history for itself. However since there has been no word or confirmation of a th yet been crossing my fingers for an E announcement every year you may not want to get invested in it.  Regardless of what you do good luck! Its a whole new ballgame!,GoldenSun,crfcog1,2,t5_2s75v
4933027,0,t1_cueugo0,I would agree with you for FF. I only played it over  years after its release so the graphics and battle system were nothing particularly impressive to me. But what really annoyed me was the story. I never understood how Sephiroth was supposed to be able to mindcontrol Cloud. Supposedly because he was a Soldier he was supposed to have been artificially infused some alien material to increase his battle prowess but since he wasnt actually a Soldier the entire thing was just a shitfest of some placebo effect because he believes that he somehow should have been mindcontrolled. There were so many inconsistencies that I just lost interest. Hopefully the HD remake will change some parts of the storyline so that it makes more sense.However I greatly enjoyed FF FF FF FF FF FF Tactics Advance  and  and Bravely Default. Granted FF Tactics Advance would have really benefited from a less childish storyline and Bravely Default from having less repetition but they were still very enjoyable. Enough so that I spent a lot of time in nearly every one of these games carefully planning out party skill or item optimization and such in extensive details.Just like I did for Golden Sun.,GoldenSun,cugcih2,1,t5_2s75v

7091366,0,t3_4cn29m,A few psynergy in GS have dubious elemental typing. Move is a Mars psynergy Lift is Mercury Force has no elemental affinity and Call Zombie is Mercury. Lash is Jupiter which seems inconsistent with GS typing youd probably expect it to be Venus since Venus gets Carry or Mercury because of Lift but at least that makes some intuitive sense.In Dark Dawn Call Zombie effectively becomes Undead Curse from the Curse Mage class exclusive to Himi and is a Venus psynergy. Move gets retyped to being a Venus psynergy as well. ,GoldenSun,d1k6bfj,3,t5_2s75v

9197974,0,t1_d8hvm1p,Its actually trimmed down compared to the v. iteration of the system.  Before I tried to get each weapon type so stuff like martial poles were included and what not.  Ive made changes even from the v. due to not being able to justify the ClawKnuckle separation from DD.  StaffAnkh is simple offense and defense  and adding scythes is simple too.  Treat them not as physical weapons for reaping but as spellcasting implements that focus on control to complete that triangle.Each the weapons have their own statistical tweaks but that alone wont really have much of an impact on the system.  I want weapon choice to actually matter to have a notable impact on gameplay.  I figure have them effect your spells too so that even when youre not using the attack command what type of weapon you have equipped has an effect.Consider it a rebellion against have weapons being nothing more than attack stats with an unleash.  I always hated that there was little point to equipping an axe over a sword.So I took the weapons that appear in GS  Axes Swords Blades Maces Bows Fists Staves and Ankhs.  Then I added enemyonly weapons  Spear and Scythe.  Then I applied whether its physicalonly Sword Axe Spear casteronly Staff Ankh Scythe or something that could be used by either Blade Mace Fist Bow.  Finally brought the other two up to match the greater value using logical additions warhammers to physical inspired by the approach taken in The Elder Scrolls.  Daggers to caster under the idea of the ritual daggeratheme.In other words  is the bare minimum.  Give each two subcategories for minor trends so as to apply other weapons people want to use into it.  Want to use a Kusarigami?  My system would count it as a Sickleclass Scythe.  Want to use a martial staff?  My system would count it as a twohandedclass spear.  Claws would fall under Fists now because seriously what the hell was I supposed to do with claws?So when creating a character if youre a caster you can pick  between hybrid and caster weapons.  If youre a warrior you can pick between  hybrid and physical weapons.  If youre that one weirdo who wants to play the notadept guy Freelancers can pick  between all weapon categories.,GoldenSun,d8hwsk4,1,t5_2s75v

9701610,0,t3_5du5jn,I thought this was the only truly interesting battle in the game. They dont do enough damage to pose an actual threat but when I saw the psy grenades I thought it was a sign that Camelot was mixing up the combat so that you couldnt simply chew on the A button and win. I was wrong and this tactic never showed up again. DD is such a waste of a game. I feel really bad for the art team. Amazing graphics outside of the stupid chibi over world stuff. ,GoldenSun,da8xilx,1,t5_2s75v

10159447,0,t1_dbmyait,Sure thing. Another one that I forgot to mention earlier is a game called Evoland . Its an indie game on steam that you can buy for usually  but atm its on sale for . Its much more of a parody game than all the others that Ive listed. Its a time travel story with a twist. For every different Era that you visit the graphics improverecess  depending on when you are. For example if your playing in the present then youll have  Graohics very reminiscent to the Golden Sun games themselves or alternatively if your in the past then the graphics will be much more akin to old Gameboy color games. The game has a TON of winks and nods to other game series. Id recommend this game wholeheartedly to any one thats a fan of the Golden Sun series or video games in general. There is an Evoland  buuuuut I havent played that yet.I think that bout wraps it up. Hope that the list helps and good luck with the new year.,GoldenSun,dbvmomz,1,t5_2s75v

11051432,0,t3_5xt1se,Before I respond to some points of your post Id like to point out that the reason why GS was split into two games was mainly due to hardware limitations of the GBA. I agree with you on how Isaac and Co. just completely drop everything they were fighting for and join Felixs cause. I think it wouldve made it a lot more interesting if Camelot found a way to make fighting their team into a boss fight but that I see how that would cause difficulty balancing issues and what not. And as to your point of the first four characters being an afterthought well If you can look at the dialogue and script carefully the characters are primarily just a means of setting exposition. Aside of a couple of lines that show some personality the games dialogue is the way the games tells you about its lore and backstory one of the major gripes I have with the game as you barely see any complex personalities with its characters but maybe Im asking for too much. Because of that theres no reason for Isaac and Co. to have a precense in the dialogue besides the endingfinal boss.Glad to see you like it though its one of my favorite games ever besides its flaws mainly because it was one my first ever jrpgs that Ive played as a kid. Im replaying the games with a difficulty patch that makes combat x more interesting. Its called Golden Sun Fallen StarRisen Star highly recommend it if you thought difficulty was a huge issue when you were playing the game.   ,GoldenSun,deknsns,7,t5_2s75v
