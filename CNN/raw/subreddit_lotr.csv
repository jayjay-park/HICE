51285,0,t1_cek9eda,This passage has always struck me. Theres something so rich and moving but so clever about the Ringbearer and his humble servant somewhat mirthfully discussing in the most dismal locale whether theyll ever be woven into a great tale after the Quest succeeds even as they have a growing understanding that they could never succeed or that if they do they certainly will perish in the attempt. I always thought it the quintessence of the character of the hobbit.Not to mention the joy Tolkien must have known hed be giving his readers by having these beloved characters parody their reaction to the very story theyre reading.,lotr,cek9p5s,7,t5_2rfb9

80614,0,t1_cenkyyw,Physically they can exist there but its not ideal. Tolkien talks about about what the experience would be of a mortal who grew up and lived in Aman in THoME X Morgoths Ring and its not pleasant. He would live in what would seem to him an unchanging world and this would cause grief to them. Also after about  years their spirit and body would be at conflict there which presents a special difficulty for the Nmenreans.I dont think this would have been much of an issue for the exceptions. Bilbo Sam and Gimli were all very old when they went there.Frodo was comparatively younger but his chance for healing was worth the potentially greater emotional harm. He would not have been able to enjoy life in Middleearth but in Aman he had a chance.,lotr,cenluvj,3,t5_2rfb9

84449,0,t1_ceo0n23,I think it boils down to figuring out and nitpicking what Tolkien meant by words such as smote and broke.  If there even can be an answer.  From the description of the BalroggtI threw down my enemy and he fell from the high place and broke the mountainside where he smote it in his ruin.and gtThe tower behind was crumbled into dust the window gone the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone.So the Balrog caused significant damage to the peak but enough the mountain was intact.  The movie actually captures my vision of the peak pretty well.  A tiny lonely crag something like this as opposed to this but thats just me.  Hes not overly descriptive.  Id think the power of even a humansized Balrog could break up a peak like that.  But the peak is still there just busted up.Now we go back to gtand he fell upon the towers of Thangorodrim and they were broken in his ruin.Its worded exactly the same.  broke the mountain side broken in his ruin.  The only difference is and he fell upon the towerS of Thangorodrim and THEY were broken in his ruin. Plural.  So hes big enough at the very least to cause noticeable damage to two or more mountain peaks at once.  So either hes REALLY big or Tolkien wrote that sentence without thinking about what it would mean for a creature to fall out of the sky and hit two peaks simultaneously.  And the other thing is that while I completely agree with you that the picture I linked is ridiculous I really see nothing directly countering it from Tolkiens writings other than the fact that it seems completely out of his character to write that.  MiddleEarth isnt Warcraft MiddleEarth dragons are typical European mythology dragons much like all  you linked all which are awesome and seem much more in the spirit of MiddleEarth by the way and a continent sized Ancalagon is ridiculous.  I think its just one of those many contradictions with no answer.,lotr,ceo1kkx,5,t5_2rfb9

Eowyn is singing in the language of the Rohirrim.The lingua franca in MiddleEarth is Westron which is the cradle language spoken by the Hobbits. Its pretty universally spoken in the lands that the Hobbit and LotR occur in though some people particularly the Elves use their own languages among themselves. Westron is a language of Mannish origin though with Elven influences.Regarding Elves and Dwarves the dislike there is not perfectly even throughout history. There was great friendship between the Dwarves of Moria and the Elves of Eregion the Elven kingdom that existed near to Moria in the Second Age. The western gate of Moria was actually built specifically so that they could deal with one another easily.

Ive seen a lot of people say that Fingolfin was the most powerful elf because he went up against Morgoth but Feanor was clearly the most powerful elf.He fought for  days against a legion of the most powerful balrogs to exist. He never went toe to toe with Morgoth but just because Fingolfgin went toe to toe with a Valar doesnt make him the strongest elf. Feanor probably could have done just as well if not better than Fingolfin if he was in the same situation. He died because of his own uncontrollable passion not because he was weak. I mean the Silmarillion even clearly states that Feanor was the mightiest nonValanonMaia being to ever exist.For Fanor was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind in valour in endurance in beauty in understanding in skill in strength and subtlety alike of all the Children of Ilvatar and a bright flame was in him.The dudes spirit was so powerful that his body burned to ash when he died. His willpower and personality were so strong that the entire history of Middle Earth went down because of his personal decisions. He created the most powerful objects to ever exist in the silmarils which he put some of his own essence and skill into.I mean Fingolfin was a pure badass and much more likable than Feanor and his battle with Morgoth is probably the coolest fing thing Ive ever read in the entire lore of LotR but lets be real here. Feanor was the mightiest man or elf to ever exist.

Would you go with him to take on the leader of a Mexican drug cartel? probably not.gtwhat ARE there own prioritiesA chief one would be not dying. They are sentient beings and dont run suicide missions any more than humans do probably less so since humans know theyre doomed if Sauron wins whereas the Eagles can just fly away. Flying into Mordor would be very flashy and visible and while its not outright stated what will happen if Sauron sees you it most likely involves a swift death.EDIT mind you not only would it involve a swift death if they were carrying the ring Sauron would get that as well. As to why they would fly in and retrieve Frodo and Sam afterwards seems obvious No more Sauron no more nazgul. Its simple and relatively low risk.,lotr,chiws2h,2,t5_2rfb9

He has more snow yet to fling at us if we go on. It was no ordinary storm. It is the ill will of Caradhras. He does not love elves and dwarves and that snow drift was laid to cut off our escape.Gimli speaking to the mountain Enough enough! We are departing as quickly as we may!

1962944,0,t1_ckpegth,Its a bit complicated to give an answer to this but here goes.I was living in New Zealand for  months on a working holiday in Wellington but the majority of these photos were taken on two trips that I did on my time off. There was  onemonth road trip North and South Island with my sister and her fiance and then another day trip south Island only I did on my own a couple months later.Bottom line NZ is not a cheap place to travel. The onemonth road trip put us back just under  each not including flights. We had a rental car about  a day not including gas and tried to camp in a tent as much as possible rather than stay at hostels pp a night for a dorm bed.One can spend an endless amount of cash on tours and activities throwing  here and  there. Guided LOTR tours range from  to  unless youre going by helicopter then add . Skydiving starts around  and goes up to . With the exception of Edoras we opted to drive to the film locations ourselves rather than go on official tours. There is a great guide book they sell in NZ that says where all the film locations are with GPS and we used that a lot. A lot of that information is online as well. There are a few locations that while public were unpaved access only such as Edoras so keep that in mind when choosing a vehicle. Hobbiton has to be booked as a tour and if you drive there yourself itll still costs you about  each to enter and you can only stay for a maximum of two hours. otherwise visitors would just want to hang out there all day.Fortunately some of the greatest attractions in NZ are walks which are either free or relatively  cheap to access. Theres nothing like hiking over mountains and up volcanos to really make you feel like youre deep in Middle Earth. If you want to know about places and activities Id recommend as mustdos or a more information about the Middle Earth locations feel free to ask me.TLDR If youre making the trek all the way to NZ give yourself at least a couple months to really do it properly and enough cash to experience the activities. You can see all the highlights in one month but that means rushing through and heading to a new place every day. Budget for about  to  a month. ,lotr,ckpqivw,1,t5_2rfb9

I think that some folks feel like the original is being overwhelmed by the typhoon of related material to its detriment and they feel defensive about that.One thing I have noticed though is that while the defenders of Tolkien tend to focus on the material in question the defenders of the films or games or whatever tend to focus on the defenders of Tolkien using these terms for lack of better ones. Im not sure why that is. While I wont tolerate abuse on either side Ive had to ban way more on one side than the other and I find it odd.That said if you encounter book defenders behaving badly please report it.

The part  of the Fellowship is very very dry and if youre used to the more engaging style of Martin youll likely not make it past chapter  or so. So I just just skimming each chapter in part one. Spot read it dont worry about every detail or understanding it fully. Oh Frodo and pals are hanging with Tom Bombadil? Got it. Do this until the character Strider Aragorn shows up. At this point the story picks up to a fairly accessible level for the rest of the novel.I have seen so many new readers just drop Tolkien completely because of part  of LotR and I cant stress enough that it get way better.Later after youve gain a sense for how Tolkien writes and an appreciation for the depth of his prose go back and reread part  its a very rewarding experience.,lotr,cl4bdcz,1,t5_2rfb9

In the North kingdom one was at Amon Sul or Weathertop and one at Annuminas. Both were lost at sea in a shipwreck. In Gondor there was one at Minas Ithil before its fall and it was seized by Sauron and used to communicate with Saruman who had the Orthanc stone. The last stone was the stone of Minas Anor used by Denethor. After Aragorn reclaimed the kingship he reclaimed also the use of the Orthancstone while the Elostirion stone was sent West on the Elvish ships. The Anorstone which had been held by Denethor was not used for he killed himself with the Stone in his hands and the only thing anyone except the very strongwilled could see in it was his hands burning in flames.,lotr,cnxb8km,1,t5_2rfb9

Quenya was the ancient noble language which actually evolved from Sindarin and was brought back ennobled from across the Great Sea. Like Latin at a time it was the language of the nobility and lorekeeping. Tengwar was the script the alphabet used to write these languages.The black speech is a language created by Sauron to try and unite his armies who up to then each had their own weird dialect. It uses a form of Tengwar which we can see on the Ring.I might have made some mistakes but I believe this is it.

I dont think we have any real reason to believe that the other ringwraiths were in high positions in the military hierarchy as they were only really depicted in their flyingaroundspreadingfearanddread mode of operation during the battle. We know that there was somebody named Gothmog that took over once the Wk was taken out but have no detail on who or what he was otherwise to my knowledge PJ chose to depict him as the deformed orc in the RotK film. We also know that a Man was Saurons lieutenant at the Black Tower and the emissary he sent to the Black Gate  the Mouth of Sauron  so it wouldnt surprise me if there were more Black Numenoreans in other high offices in the organization.However barring Word of God otherwise I think its reasonable to have leadership of groups of troops be members of that group Orcs leading Orcs Men leading Men etc. but at the upper strategic levels generals and whatnot over the whole combined force I dont know if we have anything to base opinions on.,lotr,cox8i2k,7,t5_2rfb9

3370884,0,t1_cpc9ss1,Norwegian doesnt output that much literature compared to other countries not much of anything to be honest. Most frustrating thing when learning Norwegian... so I could imagine that most of what those two read are translations and translations for such small languages are usually not that great. The German version of the books is just as good as the English one in my opinion if you dont buy the new translation and The Witcher books are even better than the English ones according to Poles that speak English and German. But we also have  million native speakers compared to Norwegians  million.Another explanation might be that Norwegian is lacking the grammatical features of German or Slavic languages to play with the sentence structure but also lacking the large foreign vocabulary you can find in English that would allow you to play around with different words that have a more narrow meaning or a different connotation. So maybe the Norwegian version sounds a bit... standard? Thats just speculation though.

And I wouldnt be so hasty to assume the Valar would have given the Silmarils back to him anyway. I mean if we assume events played out largely the same during the First Age again thats a big if in and of itself then ultimately the Host of the West would need to come and would themselves recover the Silmarils. If Feanor stole them back just as his sons did I suspect his fate would be the same either to commit suicide or pass into some lonely forlorn  existence or fall in some other unforseen way. If he doesnt recover the Silmarils and yet survives then I have no doubt his pride would be much too great to return to Valinor even if the Valar still pardoned the Noldor.,lotr,cr1k9us,1,t5_2rfb9

4316451,0,t1_csbznwc,I used to think this too. But look at Frodo. Hes bearing this great burden that almost no one else could bear. People tend to think Sam could but Im not so sure. Using his brief time with it as an indicator isnt really fair as Frodo had much greater exposure to the ring by that point  years plus a year of it actively trying to wear him down on the journey.With that out of the way I think the thing that put Frodo and Sam back on equal footing for me is how they treat Gollum. Sam doesnt quite understand pity and mercy whereas Frodo really comes to appreciate it and act them out. It was Sams harsh reaction that finally sealed Gollums fate and though he cant be blamed for Gollums woes he does bear the blame for denying Gollum that one last chance at redemption and undoing all the good Frodo had been working for Gollum up until then.Frodo to me seems to have a more noble refined understanding of what it means to be a good person. A more Christian understanding if you will as mercy and forgiveness are very very Christian virtues dont misunderstand of course nonChristians can display these traits. But Frodo doesnt really display this much outside of Gollum of course and cant as hes fighting the ring the whole way. Sam has a more simple understanding of what it means to be good  love your friends and love them sacrificially. But the reason I say its more simple is that its largely directed at his friends not towards those who seek ill for the people he loves.  Luke  ... take it away uversebotBoth are great heroes.

4670767,0,t3_3ew5kj,Wow.  Great article although to truly compare both stories it seems to me the author should read both sets of books.  Still he raises some good points.  I think perspective can account for at least some of the underlying philosophical differences.  Tolkein had an eye in the sky perspective.  He narrated his story from a distance recounting it the way a person might who was an oral historian as opposed to a participant.  This makes sense given his background as a historian.  Martin tells you the story from the ground as if you were standing right among the damned.  Makes sense given his background as a screenwriter.  As someone who read all of the books I have to say the nihilism began to weigh on me after a while.   I looked at ASOFAI and thought thats how the world is sometimes but its not how it should be.  Tolkeins work on the other hand extolls the virtues of love and honor.  I would argue that things didnt exactly turn out super rosy in LOTR.  Frodo was pretty much damaged for life from his trip and Boromir was no better off than if he had been a Stark at the red wedding.

4713692,0,t1_ctohs6q,I first read LOTR at  and my son first read it at . I dont think we should take the reading age thing too literally but the readability analysis does robustly show a major difference of a kind between the two works which has to do with the amount of reading skill required.Im sure Tolkien didnt think I put  polysyllables in the last  sentences so Id better add some but Martin and his editors on the other hand almost certainly do think I put  polysyllables in the last  sentences so Id better remove a few. WampaStompa refers to the role of grade level when training people to give presentations. In the US practically all material written in the huge health sector thats aimed at patients or potential patients or lowpaid providers has to be written at a low grade level probably somewhere around grade  cf. ASOIAF. The idea is to avoid getting sued when people come to harm after not understanding some writing theyve been given. Or if they do get sued the insurers lawyers can say that the standard procedure was followed for writing at grade level  so its the harmed persons own fault. There are millions of people in the US who are trained to write in this way or to check that other people have done so. They are trained to avoid using too many words of  or more syllables and sentences that are too long. I think the main index used is FleschKincaid but I prefer SMOG.Remember that this isnt to do with what any educated person would think of as difficult words. Words such as together following beautiful surrounded helpfully difficulty all have  or more syllables. Ensuring that words like this dont appear more than once every  sentences means that Martin is writing for retards.People can say tastes differ or people dont have a right to criticise or they can assert in an infantile way that everyone can do what they want and nothing anyone chooses to do has a harmful effect so long as its legal but this doesnt get around the empirically shown retard fact.OK thats all from me.

The only thing you have to keep in mind is that you cant erase carbon like you can a pencil even though they look pretty much the same on wood. The only way to erase a carbon line is with a piece of sandpaper. But I always had a piece of the finest sandpaper available on hand anyway for runaway lines of carbon because it transfers on contact with some force theres always a chance for some runaway line which is no big deal at all btw and for burn outs. Thats when the wood directly next to your lines turns yellow from the heat something that can be easily and invisibly removed with sandpaper. That owl looks fantastic! But its definitely not anywhere near as difficult as that. Because theres really no shading or depth in the map its pretty much just line work with some filling in of letters. The biggest problem people will run into with this project is definitely having to work very patiently very slow and very carefully. Id say its absolutely doable as you really dont need much drawing skills because it basically just comes down to tracing lines. The most important thing is finding out what works best for you in terms of getting even and steady lines and that just comes down to practice.,lotr,cv4nu2o,1,t5_2rfb9

For in his condition it was for him a sacrifice to perish on the Bridge in defence of his companions less perhaps than for a mortal Man or Hobbit since he had a far greater inner power than they but also more since it was a humbling and abnegation of himself in conformity to the Rules for all he could know at that moment he was the only person who could direct the resistance to Sauron successfully and all his mission was vain. He was handing over to the Authority that ordained the Rules and giving up personal hope of success. gtThat I should say is what the Authority wished as a setoff to Saruman. The wizards as such had failed or if you like the crisis had become too grave and needed an enhancement of power. So Gandalf sacrificed himself was accepted and enhanced and returned. ...gt  He was sent by a mere prudent plan of the angelic Valar or governors but Authority had taken up this plan and enlarged it at the moment of its failure. Naked I was sent back  for a brief time until my task is done. Sent back by whom and whence?

5624160,0,t3_3rz590,First Saruman would have been at the council of elrond and Gandalf would not have been delayed in getting to the Shire to help Frodo travel. With the help of Gandalf and others I doubt Frodo would have been stabbed by the witch king reducing his grief very much. Its possible the fellowship would have been different. Adding Saruman means another member would need to be dropped. My guess is that Merry and Pippin would have been removed and Saruman would have convinced or decided as he was the head of the white council that himself and someone else of power probably Glorfindel should go.The group would have headed south from Rivendell taking the Gap of Rohan. Boromir wanted to do this all along but the others would not vote for this because Saruman was too dangerous. I believe they would have stayed in Isengard rather than Lorien. Lorien was north from where they were headed and I dont see why they would go out of their way to travel north again.Heading East the group would have split up as originally inteded and Aragorn would have left with Boromir for Minas Tirrith Its hard to say who would have went into Mordor and who would have continued to Gondor.

The person who does the best gets to make the next set of questions where they are of course allowed to use materials. Im sure there are other similar ideas that might have a more subjective feel like the rpowermetal contests.Another idea I have is maybe have a character discussion thread each week where a character from one of the books is selected as the subject and we discuss how they develop in the story their achievements what we likedont like about them how good they are in a literary sense etc. Could also apply to events places etc.,lotr,cwv0edm,2,t5_2rfb9

5856968,0,t1_cxn1aav,I understand completely why they removed Tom Bombadil. The film has just been explaining how dangerous and powerful the ring is but it would send seriously mixed signals to the audience to then have a character of uncertain origin who never appears again be completely unaffected by it. I understand that in the books this is actually the entire point of the way things are set up. The reader now knows that Tom Bombadil is something altogether different. However in a film thats already overlong for many members of the moviegoing public and dispenses with much of the books worldbuilding including this particular piece would only stop the momentum of the narrative dead in its tracks to confuse the audience for no real payoff. The Scouring of the Shire is a little different because the films changed the main point of the ending. In the books the impression that I got was that the hobbits return to the Shire and the subsequent battle to reclaim it was supposed to represent that hobbits could no longer live in bliss ignorance of the world around them. Rather they need to be vigilant and capable of violence represented in their ability to take back the Shire through force unaided by outsiders for their own sake because times have changed. In the films the hobbits return is almost the opposite. The Shire is still living in ignorance of the outside world despite the monumental things that have come to pass. For all of the hobbits and Frodo especially the things that theyve experienced in their journeys have changed them and Frodo is so dramatically different that he does not really belong in the Shire anymore. For what its worth I like the ending in the books better but I can see why the films changed that too because the ending takes long enough already for most viewers and an extended coda on top of that would probably try their patience. ,lotr,cxndku4,6,t5_2rfb9

He lead the Army of the Dead and scared away the enemies of Gondor on its southern border and lifting the siege of the Pelargir. He captured the fleet of Umbar and lead an army not the army of the dead though but soldiers of Gondors southern fiefs to Pelennor thus saving Minas Tirith. He unfurled the flag of Elendil. He healed the future Steward of Gondor Faramir and also owyn and many others thus proving for most at least to be the legitimate King hands of the King are hands of the healer and thus the rightful King was known.He lead an army to the Black Gate and was prepared to sacrifice his own life there.

6484051,0,t3_44gcro,Hell no.gt Into the ultimate judgement upon Gollum I would not care to enquire. This would be to investigate Goddes privitee as the Medievals said. Gollum was pitiable but he ended in persistent wickedness and the fact that this worked good was no credit to him. His marvellous courage and endurance as great as Frodo and Sams or greater being devoted to evil was portentous but not honourable. I am afraid whatever our beliefs we have to face the fact that there are persons who yield to temptation reject their chances of nobility or salvation and appear to be damnable. Their damnability is not measurable in the terms of the macrocosm where it may work good. But we who are all in the same boat must not usurp the Judge. The domination of the Ring was much too strong for the mean soul of Smeagol. But he would have never had to endure it if he had not become a mean son of thief before it crossed his path. Need it ever have crossed his path? Need anything dangerous ever cross any of our paths? A kind of answer cd. be found in trying to imagine Gollum overcoming temptation. The story would have been quite different! By temporizing not fixing the still not wholly corrupt Smeagolwill towards good in the debate in the slag hole he weakened himself for the final chance when dawning love of Frodo was too easily withered by the jealousy of Sam before Shelobs lair. After that he was lost.,lotr,czpzyyp,174,t5_2rfb9
6485791,0,t1_czq5y4c,In another letter Tolkien talks about that being one of his favorite parts of the tale.gtFor myself I was prob. most moved by Sams disquisition on the seamless web of story and by the scene when Frodo goes to sleep on his breast and the tragedy of Gollum who at that moment came within a hair of repentance  but for one rough word from Sam.and gtbut I am most stirred by the sound of the horses of the Rohirrim at cockcrow and most grieved by Gollums failure just to repent when interrupted by Sam  this seems to me really like the real world in which the instruments of just retribution are seldom themselves just or holy and the good are often stumbling blocks. ....andgtI think rather of the mysterious last petitions of the Lords Prayer Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. A petition against something that cannot happen is unmeaning. There exists the possibility of being placed in positions beyond ones power. In which case as I believe salvation from ruin will depend on something apparently unconnected the general sanctity and humility and mercy of the sacrificial person. I did not arrange the deliverance in this case it again follows the logic of the story. Gollum had had his chance of repentance and of returning generosity with love and had fallen off the knifeedge. In the case of those who now issue from prison brainwashed broken or insane praising their torturers no such immediate deliverance is as a rule to be seen. But we can at least judge them by the will and intentions with which they entered the Sammath Naur and not demand impossible feats of will which could only happen in stories unconcerned with real moral and mental probability.gtNo Frodo failed. It is possible that once the ring was destroyed he had little recollection of the last scene. But one must face the fact the power of Evil in the world is not finally resistible by incarnate creatures however good and the Writer of the Story is not one of us.If this kind of stuff thrills you you should give Tolkiens Letters a read!  There are some difficulties with what would happen if Sam didnt follow.  After all something as simple as not having rope would completely change the outcome.  Would the fire have been lit and themselves exposed to the Faramir and his men?  These are huge what ifs that could have a more direct effect on the events.,lotr,czq6g9u,17,t5_2rfb9

After rewetting the EE trilogy recently I also noticed that after Frodo returns home to the shire instead of wearing his darker colored garments buttoned up he leaves them open showing the lighter colored shirt underneath. Could this symbolize how underneath his soul has now regained peace and happiness after the parting of the ring but the darker vest thats put over the top shows that he still in a way bears the weight the ring bestowed upon him.

That the films might have differences in tone seems more a function of the different parts of the story they are telling than anything else. I mean Tolkien did not write a trilogy per se he wrote until he got to the end and then stopped. His publisher chopped it into three parts just to be able to avoid binding them together into one huge volume. Similarly I look at the films as one long presentation delivered in three segments. Same director same cast same story. I dont mind that folks feel like they want to rate them individually it just puzzles me I guess.

8095093,0,t3_4q2zkn,The Silmarillion contains the creation story there was Eru God and he created the Ainur angelic spirits. The Ainur sang a song in which they imagined the world Arda and Eru made it real. Then some of the Ainur went down to Arda and finished the job by creating seas and mountains and stuff. The most powerful of them are called the Valar and the others are called Maiar.The Wizards were Maiar sent to Middleearth in the shape of old men to help the Free Peoples against Sauron. But they were not allowed to dominate them only to guide them. With his power Gandalf could very well dominate people into doing what he wants but he just offers help. He asks Thoden to accept his guidance. He also does the same with Aragorn just asking him to come with him.gt Then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again? said Legolas.gt I did not say so said Gandalf. Who knows? Have patience. Go where youmust go and hope! To Edoras! I go thither also.gt It is a long way for a man to walk young or old said Aragorn. I fearthe battle will be over long ere I come there.gt We shall see we shall see said Gandalf. Will you come now with me?He says something similar to Thodengt Now Thoden son of Thengel will you hearken to me? said Gandalf. Doyou ask for help? He lifted his staff and pointed to a high window. There thedarkness seemed to clear and through the opening could be seen high and fara patch of shining sky. Not all is dark. Take courage Lord of the Mark forbetter help you will not find. No counsel have I to give to those thatdespair. Yet counsel I could give and words I could speak to you. Will youhear them? They are not for all ears. I bid you come out before your doors andlook abroad. Too long have you sat in shadows and trusted to twisted tales andcrooked promptings.Here is what it says in the Silmarillion. The Lords of the West are the Valargt Even as the first shadows were felt in Mirkwood there appeared in the west of Middleearth the Istari whomMen called the Wizards. None knew at that time whence they were save Crdan of the Havens and only to Elrond andto Galadriel did he reveal that they came over the Sea. But afterwards it was said among the Elves that they weremessengers sent by the Lords of the West to contest the power of Sauron if he should arise again and to move Elvesand Men and all living things of good will to valiant deeds. In the likeness of Men they appeared old but vigorous andthey changed little with the years and aged but slowly though great cares lay on them great wisdom they had andmany powers of mind and handSo they had been walking around Middleearth for some  years before the events of LotR.Gandalf himself also mentions his past that he was called Olrin in the West that is forgottengt The Grey Pilgrim?  said Frodo. Had he a name?gt Mithrandir we called him in elffashion said Faramir and he wascontent. Many are my names in many countries he said. Mithrandir among theElves Tharkn to the Dwarves Olrin I was in my youth in the West that isforgotten in the South Incnus in the North Gandalf to the East I go not.The Silmarillion has the origin stories of many people and creatures from LotR. There are many references to people and things from the Silmarillion in LotR. Elbereth is one of the Valar for example. Remember that Saruman looked to the West when he died and a west wind blew his spirit away? Probably a reference to the Valar and maybe Manw specifically.Sauron and the Balrog are also Maiar btw but corrupted ones.,lotr,d4pymcx,22,t5_2rfb9

8368788,0,t3_4u8ecf,Hi there Im the guy who put this fan edit together and I just wanted to say thank you for the nice post. Like you before the Hobbit films I really had no interest in either watching or making a fan edit of an existing film for the same reasons you listed. A lot of times youll watch a movie that doesnt have enough good material which makes it impossible for a secondhand editor to magically make more content for a fan edit.With PJs Hobbit films there was obviously way more material than was required to tell the core story of Bilbo and the Dwarves...which made it perfect for an editor like myself to remove unnecessary subplots and characters. Ive loved Tolkiens world since I was maybe eight years old and the LOTR films were incredible adaptations of his work. They captured the spirit of the books for the most part. The Hobbit trilogy in its original form did not. What originally started as a personal selfish editing project for me turned into something that I wanted to share with other Tolkien fans. Im glad that many people have watched and enjoyed it so far...I dont think Ill ever be able to watch the original films again honestly!EDIT Heres my original post on this sub in case you guys are skeptical of my identity ,lotr,d5nndc3,52,t5_2rfb9

8393607,0,t3_4ujhrp,I think your opinion on some things will change once you complete the books but there is one particular part of your argument that is flat out wrong.You say that Denethor was not corrupted by the Palantir but this is not so. First you are correct in saying that he was a very great and powerful man and was able to withstand a lot. However the only difference between how Saruman and Denethor were corrupted by the palantir is how they responded to it.See when Denethor was looking through the Palantir he thought he was looking freely but really Sauron was dictating what he saw. He showed Denethor a very censored version of events that made it seem like all hope was lost.Saruman saw similar things and decided to join Sauron but he was not controlled like you imply. If he was he surely wouldnt have taken the hobbits to Isengard to Isengard to Isengard! but to Mordor. I have no doubt in my mind that although Saruman was corrupted by Sauron he was not being controlled in any way like how Theoden was being controlled. Denethor instead of deciding to join Sauron like Saruman had decided that everyone was against him Gondor was on its own and they had no hope of survival. This made him paranoid suspicious and reckless. Basically Denethor was corrupted in the same way that say the North Korean people are corrupted. They are being fed a very very very biased viewpoint and have no secondary source. But unlike North Korea Denethor has absolutely no reason to believe he is being misled by the Palantir. Also from what I understand Denethor was a truly great man in every meaning of the word and the true Denethor was very much unlike the Denethor we met in Return of the King. By the time we are introduced to the character hes basically at his breaking point after being corrupted by the Palantir.Basically you dont have to directly control someone if you are their only source of information and you provide very biased info. In real life media religion and governments have done exactly this since the dawn of civilization.,lotr,d5qqxtz,12,t5_2rfb9

Lush orchards lined the smooth paved avenues laden with fruit in the summer season. Above all loomed the great Tower of Orthanc its adamant walls housing many treasures and secrets. Angrenost was a strong and beautiful place even under the rule of Saruman. It was only when the White Wizard departed from the path of wisdom that the Wizards Vale was defiled and Isengards beauty and tranquility was torn apart. But the Onodrim rose up against Curunir and cast down his wretched war machines and through their own art the Ents restored beauty and peace to Isengard and renamed it in their fashion as the Treegarth of Orthanc.

8724339,0,t1_d6w3bqb,I think they were meant to be the Dnedain of the North Kingdom or one of the remnant states of that kingdom. They were destroyed by the Witchking of Angmar and a few paragraphs earlier Merry has a vision of the men of Carn Dum which is where Angmar was. And stars are associated with the good guys with Elbereth and the Elves Eldar means starpeople. I doubt someone in the service of Sauron would wear a star. I think the guy with the star is possibly an ancestor of Aragorn but it is never stated. Legolas also sees a flame on Aragorns brow when he speaks to omer for the first time. And they get that vision the moment Tom is speaking of the Men of Westerness the Dnedain and he mentions the forgotten kings Aragorns family so I think he is clearly talking about the good guys here and not the Black Nmenoreans. So yeah as you said in your other post the guy with the star is probably someone of the line of Elros. I cant remember who was king at the time of the war with Carn Dum but it might even be possible to put a name on the guy.And we get no explanation for Tom. Tolkien mentions in one of his Letters that Tom was meant as an enigma. So he is not a Maia or any other race we know of. You are probably right in that he was put in to make the universe more interesting and to leave something for the reader to wonder about. My theory since he says he was there before the Dark Lord came from Outside Morgoth? he was already there so perhaps he was created with Arda. Ive also heard theories that he might be a remnant of the Song of Creation. Of course it is all speculation als Tolkien himself specifically said he was an enigma.,lotr,d6w6msh,1,t5_2rfb9

8874204,0,t3_51rdbh,Id like to echo all the other comments and make one more point.Gandalf never speaks of things that he himself has not personally verified.  I think thats a super important theme in the novels.  Eyewitness verification...  He has suspicions but keeps them mostly to himself.  He never speaks of the Ring as the One Ring until he reads the words inscribed upon it himself.  He does not advocate for traveling through Moria except as an opportunity born of need... both Aragorn and Gandalf suspect Moria holds an ancient evil but neither of them speculate openly.I love that about Gandalfs character. Even in simple nonthreatening situations he will not claim knowledge that he doesnt have regardless of obvious circumstantial evidence.  When he talks to Bilbo after The Party Bilbo says well I guess you know best...  And Gandalf responds I do.  When I know anything.And to Frodo long after Bilbo departs... about the Ring... Know?  I dont know... there is one final test to be made.He even scolds Wormtongue... Lie!  That word comes too easily from your tongue.  I dont lie.  The wise speak only of what they know.Gandalf doesnt speculate openly.  And he never presents anything as fact that he doesnt know from personal observation.  Countless more examples from the text elude my memory.edit I thought of another one... the Palantirs of Orthanc and Minas Tirith... even after Wormtongue chucks the Palantir at Gandalf and Pippin recovers it... Gandalf still says that he is not sure how Isengard and Mordor exchanged news.  Only after Pippin looks in the Stone does Gandalf say that his suspicion is confirmed.  This is echoed by the Palantir of Minas Tirith.  In both cases Gandalf must have known well... as he would say suspected but he never states as fact his suspicions until he confirms them in person.Also and secondarily... the Dwarves are not Olrins task in Middleearth.  Hes much busier with the issue of Sauron and The Ring and his business was much more dangerous though the Shirefolk knew nothing of that.note... all quotes off the top of my head and may deviate slightly from the actual text.,lotr,d7ejymz,21,t5_2rfb9

Itd be super easy to fit in the Scouring and the omission leaves out a very important moral  things change when youre gone. And Faramir was my favorite character in the book second to Sam of course as he was a call back to a more noble age. The whole story between him Boromir and Denethor II was so...sad. Boromir of course redeemed himself at the last minute but had Denethor II gotten over his beloved son and sent the right man for the job the Fellowship might not have broken at all! Faramir wouldnt have needed a last minute repentance.And you didnt mention it but I think Glorfindel shouldnt have been removed. Arwens extended stuff in the movie was okay if a bit misunderstood on the whole choosing of her doom thing but Glorfindel is so awesome! People always talk about Tom Bombadil but forget about the elf that slew several balrogs and then returned to Middleearth to fight once more!And as much as I like the part with Bombadil I think its best left out of an adaptation to film.

My interpretation is that he is not allowed to attack the enemy directly but he is allowed to stand his ground in selfdefense. He directly threatens the Witchking when he blocks him at the gate. He uses violence against the wargs whose leader he calls Hound of Sauron. I dont think the rules call for Gandalf to just stand there and let himself get killed.Note that he doesnt attack the Balrog either. He tells it to back off and stands his ground. Only after Gandalf falls down and his mission has basically failed he goes for the kill. In one of the Letters it is mentioned that Gandalf handed back or laid down his mission or some similar phrase which is very similar to what Manw did when the Nmenoreans invaded. And in both cases Eru God intervened. also for uerrece Edit oh it is correct that the Wizards were sent to Middleearth in the form of old men and with restrictions on their behaviour.

Jesus is a physical incarnation of God the Valar are not. They are lesser beings fashioned in the image of Illuvatar. Theyre more akin to angels than anything else. There is no Jesus figure in the Legendarium as God is never embodied. Tolkien says as much himself in Letter . He wanted The Lord of the Rings to be in line with Catholic theology and since it is set in the distant past of our world there can be no incarnation of God since the world still awaited the coming of Christ.gtThe only magic shown in the hobbit is made by Gandalf and SarumanSaruman never appears in The Hobbit nor is he referenced or alluded to.gtGorthaur another Maia also known as SauronSauron also never appears in The Hobbit.

There are humans that have been taught magic but such a practice is known as Sorcery and Tolkien always describes it as being evil.

10055045,0,t3_5jqmt0,I would suggest reading the books as they give a clearer picture on the nature and background of Gandalf.  Gandalf is an ainumaia.  He is in fact very old hes immortal.  He helped with the creation of the world and all that is within it in the beginning with Eru Illuvatar thru the music of the ainur Read more about this in the Silmarillion.  He is part of the Istari emissaries that were sent to MiddleEarth from the West in Valinor.  The Istari were sent to MiddleEarth to engage with the inhabitants by inspiring and to organize a resistance to Sauron they were weakened by being incarnated a.k.a. on purpose as to not show their true nature.  When it came time for Gandalf to fight the balrog remember that Gandalf was weakened and fought the Balrog until they both slew each other.  The Balrog was not under such limitation.  So in saying in all of this Gandalf was very powerful and probably could have defeated the Balrog without being slayed himself if he did not have that limitation on him.  Also dont forget Gandalf was also in secret possession of Narya one of the  rings of power that the Elves possessed.

10151366,0,t1_dbuagwz,I love my DVD EEs. I made a long post about it some time ago so I cant really dig it up but the gist of my experience is that the DVDs dont really suffer that heavily in the quality department  they look pretty good. One thing thats an actual benefit to the lower quality as odd as that sounds is that they mask some of the dated CGI. I love these movies to death but even I admit the CGI in some places despite being wetas cutting edge at the time hasnt held up. The primary stuff Mumakil Smegol is all fine but sometimes in the backgrounds of places like Helms Deep the CGI dates itself. The lower resolution format masks these issues pretty well while still presenting a good picture for the main focus of the films. Its kind of like Star Wars purity in that youre viewing the films how they were meant to be seen and youre so into them that quality doesnt bother you.But for a less obtuse argument Ive heard most versions of LotR on bluray comes with this infamous bluegreen filter  thats especially apparent on light backgrounds. Ive heard there was a box set of bluray EEs that didnt have the filter but Im sure theres enough versions now that I wouldnt know which versions have it and which dont.

10751646,0,t1_ddotd6w,gt The Witch King was certainly not human he was a wraith. An undead undying being.Thats a fundamental misunderstanding of what a wraith is. A wraith is just a person who has used a Great Ring so much that they no longer have a visible form. They are still Human just with greatly enhanced powers and menace. They are also still corporeal but their bodies simply are not visible. Heres what the text has to say on the matterA mortal Frodo who keeps one of the Great Rings does not die but he does not grow or obtain more life he merely continues until at last every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the Ring to make himself invisible he fades he becomes in the end invisible permanently and walks in the twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the Rings. Yes sooner or later  later if he is strong or wellmeaning to begin with but neither strength nor good purpose will last  sooner or later the dark power will devour him.The Shadow of the PastThose who used the Nine Rings became mighty in their day kings sorcerers and warriors of old. They obtained glory and great wealth yet it turned to their undoing. They had as it seemed unending life yet life became unendurable to them. They could walk if they would unseen by all eyes in this world beneath the sun and they could see things in worlds invisible to mortal men but too often they beheld only the phantoms and delusions of Sauron. And one by one sooner or later according to their native strength and to the good or evil of their wills in the beginning they fell under the thralldom of the ring that they bore and of the domination of the One which was Saurons. And they became forever invisible save to him that wore the Ruling Ring and they entered into the realm of shadows. The Nazgl were they the Ringwraiths the Enemys most terrible servants darkness went with them and they cried with the voices of death.Of the Rings of Power and the Third AgeThere is no mention anywhere of cessation of their humanity. They still have human bodies with all their limitations. There is no textually supported reason to believe that a sword through the face would not kill one of them.gtIt is referenced in the book as well as in the Akallebeth sic I believe.That quote doesnt exist in The Lord of the Rings to the best of my knowledge please provide it if you have it. It certainly doesnt exist in the Akallabeth which makes no mention of the Ringwraiths at all. Im fairly certain that you wont be able to find anything of the sort anywhere in the Legendarium.The closest thing to the quote youre claiming is this one No other blade not though mightier hands had wielded it would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter cleaving the undead flesh breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will.The Battle of Pelennor FieldsThat quote in no way suggests that a blade from Cardolan was the only thing that could injure or kill the WitchKing. It says what I was saying earlier the increased potency of the blade allowed Merry to deal a much more damaging blow than he normally would have causing the WitchKing to fall down and allowing Eowyn the time to stick a sword through his face.,lotr,ddoy7hy,5,t5_2rfb9
10754910,0,t1_ddooiuo,Jackson needed to present the Wraith as a threat. He is in the books. But in the books the threat isnt that he is going to personal hand Gandalfs ass to him on a platter. The threat is that he can ruin the will of the defenders and smash through fear and terror the defense of the city. That Gandalf who is not going around doing spin moves on Orcs but rallying defenders taking charge of their organization and bolstering their courage cannot keep the Men of Gondor together against the Black Captains oppressive horror.The theory is that lacking the subtlety to present this contest of wills which culminates in the scene of the Ringwraith stepping into the city through its shattered gate and meeting Gandalf standing alone before him a standoff reminiscent of Gandalf and the Balrog before the arrival of the Rohirrim calling him away Jackson decided to show the Witchking as scary because he knocked Gandalf down and broke his staff.Its one of the most despised scenes in the films.,lotr,ddpadcv,6,t5_2rfb9

10839214,0,t3_5uymxu,Its been wonderfully explained already so I wont bother repeating but Im not sure if anyone had mentioned Gimli. Frodo Sam and Bilbo were all given the honour of sailing to Valinor because they were all ring bearers and risked their souls if you will to do the task. Gimli on the other hand is given the honour of sailing to Valinor due to his immense friendship with Legolas. The first and only Dwarf in the lore to ever be given this incredible honour. Of course Gimli also played a major part in the destruction of the ring being part of the Fellowship and risking his life numerous times to quell Saurons forces and restore peace. So that certainly helped a lot. It remains up to debate if the others members of the Fellowship could also be given this honour. It seems unlikely. Boromir was of course dead Aragorn was needed to rule the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor and would be needed to do so until his death. Merry and Pippin were also heroes and legends of The Shire they were instrumental in relations to the outside world and were given official offices in The Shire. So could they have gone West?

Everything else is basically just stalling and making sure that IF frodo succeeds theres something left in the world for them to live for.Destroying the Ring was always a longshot but this way especially after winning the battle of Pelennor fields taunting Sauron by marching on the black gate AND Sauron thinking Aragorn had the Ring was giving Frodo and Sam just a little bit higher chance in succeeding. If the Hobbits had failed they were doomed to die or be enslaved anyway. What better way to end your life than to march on your foe against all odds and go out fighting!,lotr,ddynmts,7,t5_2rfb9

You could interpret themes in his texts but the implication of overarching philosophy seems to be a reach. gtI cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history  true or feigned with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory but the one resides in the freedom of the reader and the other in the purposed domination of the author. J.R.R.

The wild thing in the story is that in the end the Fellowship fails in their quest  even Frodo eventually sucums to the power of the Ring.   It is the Ring itself that brings about its own  and Saurons demise.   The greed and lust for power that the Ring engenders in all but its own true master results in Golum taking back the Ring and then falling into the fire. Now many of the members of the Fellowship and others are greatly changed for the better by the events of the Lord of the Ring  but if Golum had not gone after the Ring  all would have been lost.  ,lotr,deow7px,5,t5_2rfb9

Umbar was a major stronghold of Easterlings originally founded by Nmenoreans Black Nmenoreans?. A mmak was with the Southrons when they had their fight with Faramirs Rangers which was witnessed by Sam so I guess they are from the south. There is also a bunch of East thats not on the map so I guess most of the Easterlings are from there.

Its fan fiction that very poorly attempts to hide its nature behind a veneer of its appendices lore. It is a direct contradiction to some of the most basic themes present in Tolkiens work and its unapologetic about it while trying to insist that it is a faithful adaptation. It looks like LoTR because it looks like PJs films. This is in absolutely no way a mere personal belief. It is fact.

At first sight it reminded Gimli of Cram which he knows as a waybread of the Dalemen. If you know what hardtack is  which taste Tolkien could have known from the military  then you have a rough idea. This is speculative but its description in the Hobbit is spot on it is biscuitish keeps good indefinitely is supposed to be sustaining and is certainly not entertaining being in fact very uninteresting except as a chewing exercise.But lembas surprises Gimli as it reminds him more of the honeycakes of the Beornings. He praises lembas for being even better and the Beornings were the best bakers he knew of. Now you can argue Does Gimli compare because the honeycake was the best cake he had so far or because it was another form of waybread or because the taste was similar?This brings me to Beorn and the cake he was giving Bilbo and his company on their journey in The Hobbit. Being a doublebaked waybread it shares some similarities. So when it comes to guessing the closest you can imagine I would say is a double baked thin crispy wafer with a taste of honey and cream.,lotr,dg9ki5w,3,t5_2rfb9

11619861,0,t3_65tie6,Before you dive into the Silm check out Lord of the Rings. What we know about the manuscript history is there in the prologue Notes on Shire Records.gtThe largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers at Great Smials and at Brandy Hall. This account of the end of the Third Age is drawn mainly from the Red Book of Westmarch. That most important source for the history of the War of the Ring was so called because it was long preserved at Undertowers the home of the Fairbairns Wardens of the Westmarch. It was in origin Bilbos private diary which he took with him to Rivendell. Frodo brought it back to the Shire together with many loose leaves of notes and during S.R.  he nearly filled its pages with his account of the War. But annexed to it and preserved with it probably in a single red case were the three large volumes bound in red leather that Bilbo gave to him as a parting gift. gtTo these four volumes there was added in Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries genealogies and various other matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship.The original Red Book has not been preserved but many copies were made especially of the first volume for the use of the descendants of the children of Master Samwise. ,lotr,dgd4ekd,6,t5_2rfb9
