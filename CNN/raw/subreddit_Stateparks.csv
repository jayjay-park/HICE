544519,0,t3_20dhed,I plan on getting out soon to do some hiking out in hanging rock state park and stone mountain. Also want to head out to the great dismal swamp and see some of the wild Venus fly traps that still thrive in that park. Overall I think its a good start for North Carolina parks . ,Stateparks,cg262po,2,t5_2wsuk
