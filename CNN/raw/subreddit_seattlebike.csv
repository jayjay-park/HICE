5310038,0,t3_3fwgq9,For the most part SPD doesnt bother with Cyclists. I have never been pulled over in Seattle for speeding no helmet. In nearby White Center I have been pulled over for running a stop sign going  down hill in a school zone and riding my bike testing the brakes in front of my house with no helmet on. I have run red lights in front of cops Downtown and nothing. ,seattlebike,cvqf37m,0,t5_2uth0
6295076,0,t3_41t631,The tunnel is closed from November until at least April every year regardless of snow.  If you want to take the tiny road that parallels I thats up to you.  Id recommend against it.,seattlebike,cz56g5v,5,t5_2uth0
6297674,0,t3_41t631,East of the tunnel the trail is groomed for cross country skiing  it would definitely be rideable and likely really fast but youd get beat up by the skaters for leaving bike tracks on their trail.,seattlebike,cz5h348,4,t5_2uth0
6945549,0,t3_4aqvxs,Trails are a lot darker than streets... if you think your ride even might run past dusk do us all a favor and remember your headlight.  White aimed at the trail not up into peoples eyes not flashing etc...,seattlebike,d13lws1,2,t5_2uth0

10323413,0,t3_5nsd5z,Ive bought several bikes from RE and I take them back there fro service.  Theyre not cheap but they are worth every cent they charge.Personally Id sty away from Greggs.  Their service guys are really variable and too often you run into attitudes.  theyre not cheap either.My recommendation for an overhaul in your neighborhood would be Recycled Cycles on Boat Street.  Their techs are good the guy who services the service department is amazing and their default recommendation is always the least expensive option.,seattlebike,dce7ryz,7,t5_2uth0
10476197,0,t1_dcvkkqw,The prices of high powered LEDs are falling both among mainstream brands but also on all sorts of Amazon offbrands. Making very bright lights far more common.,seattlebike,dcvl3b0,6,t5_2uth0
10613859,0,t3_5rw20l,Honestly just about anything will do. Ive seen people do the complete route on compacts standards single speeds internally geared hubs you name it. Just buy whatever you think will be best for you in the long run youll be fine on the Chilly Hilly its a fun ride.,seattlebike,ddaqlqw,7,t5_2uth0

10847961,0,t3_5v29uy,Welcome!! First off snow isnt really snow here.  fall and the whole city shuts down. This was laughable coming from Chicago but the hills make it prudent to close things. SDOT doesnt have the resources to plowsalt everything anyway.Re gear  yes to the great raincoat lights and some kind of waterproof bag. Panniers arent necessary but theyre nice. I rotate between a timbuku ortliebs and a cute detours panniertote depending on the weather. It rarely pours outside of the winter months so I gravitate towards quickdrying leggings instead of rain pants. Some people do wear them though. Im not far from a bus when its awful out so thats my backup. Rain around here is mostly just light precipitation  often a mist or super light drizzle.The infra around here is pretty friendly. Cars give room and check before turning. It was night and day between my experiences riding in Chicago for  years. Besides the bike map linked below I also like to look at Strava to see where most people ride. Youll see a lot of common paths from different neighborhoods  mostly because there are a finite number of ways to get downtown.Which brings me to the key point  the topography is weird. Its hilly everywhere youll be exhausted for the first few months and nothing is direct. My commute would be  mi if there were a direct route but in reality its . with a bridge that can open at any moment blocking me halfway. Much love to SDOTbridges on Twitter  they timestamp when they openclose!. Try a few different ways see what works best for you in terms of  hills  timing  route popularity  etc. Lastly transit is okay not great. Its largely busses with intricate routing. Taking one bus to reach a destination seems rare. There is a light rail line that goes between the airport and University District if youre somewhere near it but biking is often faster. All that to simply say  its great here!! Youll have so much fun!,seattlebike,ddyw2zt,9,t5_2uth0
