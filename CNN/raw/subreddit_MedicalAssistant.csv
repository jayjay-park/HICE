I brought four to mine only ended up needed two as well as any evaluations you may have from teachers and what not. I did research on where I interviewed so I knew what I was going into about the company what the clinic does etc. Im sure youll be great wherever you end up! ,MedicalAssistant,da9mvj6,2,t5_37yfr

My program was thru Boston Reed College and was run out of an Adult School in Pittsburg CA. It was about  months long but I came in with medical experience from being an EMT amp I wasnt eligible for CMAA test but I could take NCCT test and still get certified nationally so Im called a NCMA. I didnt want to do the community college route cause I wanted to be out in the workforce sooner but YMMV. let me know if you have any other questions!,MedicalAssistant,dbgebm2,1,t5_37yfr

Its a  month program with a practicum at the very end at a place of your choosing. I qualified for financial aid and scholarships which made it even cheaper.Bonus is that its very simple to find out if its an accredited school and lots of employers look to hire new grads from the college. The director of my program actually maintains a list of places that are hiring and helps place you for your practicum.,MedicalAssistant,dd6hc4o,2,t5_37yfr
