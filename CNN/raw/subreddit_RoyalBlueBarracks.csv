955917,0,t3_2528q9,Great job every one ! There are going to be some hard days for all of us during the next week Im sure. But the first week is always the hardest and that is already behind us ! Im pretty sure that the death rate will also lower. We are past the point of no return in our mission and there is only one way we can go now and that is onwards !So onwards we go soldiers  Royal Blue forever and always !,RoyalBlueBarracks,chcy2rw,2,t5_31mm0
