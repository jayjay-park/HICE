You may also be pointing out if someone asked you a question that they understand some portion of the situation and are asking you for details.It can be used in a similar way in Korean to illustrate the listener likely understands what youre getting at already.

Instead of thinking of the entire sentence you want to say youll think of it in segments just like you would think of a sentence naturally in English. Youll be able to do this because you simply know grammar rules for how things work. Longer sentences would work the same way.

Anyway my point is again I hope I didnt come off as all knowing or ignorant in any sort of way but more so that I was comfortable with the idea of change mainly because I accept that there will be A TON that frustrates me and A TON that has me completely confused but I am there for that experience and it is without a doubt a part of it.  Your post is great in telling me exactly how it can be different and I cant thank you enough you are really right and it does make me a bit nervous.  I hope that I can take that and turn it into knowledge however and use every bit of what you have told me to my advantage! That was the goal of my post anyway to gain knowledge whether good or bad news and make the experience better for myself.  Thanks for providing specifics and giving a good warning as its a much needed reality check amongst the excitement.  I hope you will see that in no means do I hope to come off as pretentious but more like my goal is to prepare myself the best as possible hope for the best and most importantly do it anyway because it is important to me.

Almost all of my words have audio clips generally from forvo. I sometimes add hanja to the English side as well.My grammar cards are set up cloze deletion style a sentence with the part Im trying to study being removed and I enabled typing the answer for those too. Theres a grammar explanation on the answer side of those cards. My hanja cards are set up with hanjareading on one side for example   and the meaning in native KoreanEnglish on the other for my  card  to learn  .

2557327,0,t1_cmsd8zs,There isnt normal English because that would depend on what country youre in. If youre saying common English is either American or British that means it is literally unhelpful because the most knownclean American accent is completely different from the most knownclean British accent. Not only that but English is incredibly widespread to a degree that no other language can claim in this day. That makes it even less helpful to compare stuff to English without knowing where the person comes from. Korean is a completely different situation because it is isolated to two countries one of which we have limited access to so you can pretty much eliminate it from the discussion. Not only that people do not say normal Korean and things like that. They will talk about speaking in a Seoul dialect or speaking like theyre a Seoul person instead which is close to standard in Korea. But South Korea is a very small country so it makes much more sense for people to come up with a standard that others can relate to Although Seoul dialect isnt completely standard either I believe. Theres some oddities like pronouncing  like . People still generally talk about Seoul dialect as being standard despite that though.gtthats not what the question was in the first place.The question wasnt tell me English sounds that are similar but not exactly like these sounds in Korean either but people took it that way.

But what got me going in terms of confidence is necessity and wanting to be independant. And no pocket Korean friend too I guess ? Last year at some point I legit had only k left on my account because a transfer I did was blocked somewhere. I couldnt avoid going to the bank. I had a family member visiting and he was like but youve been taking classes havent you ? you should be fine. I was terrified. Every teller could hear what I was saying and there was nobody. Yet I had no money soooo with my yo korean I went in I transferred money but no show account what do pls. We misunderstood each other for  or so minutes but eventually everything got solved. Confidence . Rinse and repeat with going to immigration meeting the gfs friends the gfs sister going to the district office meeting a friend of a friend for a job recommendation going to interviews... Ive only had positive feedback so far so I look like Im better than I actually am at Korean. As far as writing is concerned well time to get that private tutor. You really need to try out anything and have someone read over it. As for another language for it to feel your own in my opinion the most important part is not how good you are at the language its how good you are at communicating with the language. I bet you know people who cant get their thoughts straight and you have a hard time understanding even in English. A famous one is even on TV the chinese guy from .

That way you are somehow forced to learn and you dont have to think what you should learn next. I tried to self.studie but I found it a lot harder. Since theres a lot of materials online I cant decide on one to follow so I spent more time searching than learning. Example I spend almost a week searching for a good site to learn Hangul. Once I found it I only learned letter meanings in romanization but not pronunciation. There are lots of videos on it but somehow I found that everyone sounds different for most of the letters.After I learn that I dont know where to start next. There is so much stuff that I get lost and ultimately decide to quit without some guidance. This happened to me with some other languages. Thats why I think school can be a lot better as a preparation and help you with your selfstudy. Of cours they wont teach you everything but as a starting point is great. The big problem I see in selfstudy is inability to recognize mistakes and learn things the wrong way. ,Korean,cvumjws,8,t5_2rd8q

Personally I prefer the order in grammar bookswebsites to start with the most common stuff and end with the least common stuff but he put  before  and   before .. gtIts also known for having a lot of mistakes through its lessonsUnless youre talking about vocabulary or sentence translations which I dont think a learner should be paying much attention to when the focus lies on learning grammar. Ive never really come across anything that really disagreed with the stuff found in TTMIK  or even krdic.naver.com or the      QampAs. More importantly even if it does contain mistakes I dont think theres any other source bar maybe  that doesnt. I own  grammar books of which  belong to the much touted including on this subreddit Korean Grammar in Use series and each book has their own flaws. For instance KGiU teaches   pages after teaching . In addition it spends no time on emphasising the  of the  part in .. which is the key to those grammar points. When explaining  they dont mention that the  part is the original form of . Furthermore for a pure grammar series its ridiculous that they straight up ignore the difficulties of vs  and spend not more than half a page on  vs  and I dont mean the obvious differences like  cant be used with  I mean the usage differences. As you know those are often particularly difficult to beginners but then they do spend  pages on the laughably simple   just because they want to follow the format that the rest of the book uses. When discussing  they only mention one of the two main uses. I could go on for days.I could write an even longer piece on the problems with Korean Grammar for International Learners which is also listed in the Intermediate thread.With this background of each resource containing serious flaws I dont find the flaws of howtostudykorean.com to somehow be bigger than those  of other resources unless you happen to know of some great book or website that Im not familiar with.

If you are regularly having more than a dozen or so words on a page that you know you probably are reading something too much above your level and I would not recommend trying to learn every single vocab word.I just started reading a new book recently. It has short stories  pages each. I just read the story once. Then I read it again underlining unknown words writing my guess on the side if I have one. Then I go back and look up the words writing them in the margin so they are out of the way. Then I read it again. After that I incorporate the words into my vocabulary studying methods using the sentences I found them in if they give useful context clues. I take breaks between these steps and I read a new story each day. I dont use Anki or any SRS Im pretty chill about memorizing vocab.Not books but related when I read webtoons with the intent of doing some studying I usually take note of all the vocab I dont know though I dont look it up until some point later.

But keep in mind that m is actually a different sound from b nor m. In other words Korean speakers perceiveand sometimes pronounce denasalized m as equivalent to m while English speakers perceive the same sound as bKorean doesnt have a b so that might be an explanation. So thats why youre hearing a b instead of m. Same thing happens to n as well.Wikipedia article It even mentions Korean at the bottom!

9496371,0,t3_5aunzu,A while ago I found an old project from when I was in junior high. I was a good student then and I thought I was pretty smart but reading now what I wrote then it was pretty bad by my current standards. Even though I was obviously then as now a native speaker of English and considered myself fluent Id say Im much better at the use of the language now. I have a wider vocabulary I better grasp the shades of meaning in different words I know more complex grammar etc. Point is I had the same kind of fluency in English then as you say you do now in Korean about middleschoolish. So what did I do since then to improve in English? Probably the same as whatever youve done to improve in English since you were fourteennot much on purpose it just happened through school and using the language. Anyway some things that might help if done in Korean of course Read widely. Read books fiction and nonfiction read short stories read Wikipedia articles read about science or politics or whatever interests you read news and analysis more The Economist than CNN read essays read textbooks. Just read read read. This helps with vocabulary spelling grammar and just a general sense of whatsoundsgood and whatsoundsbad. Look up new words when you need to but dont worry about skipping something over either.  Practice writing in genres or formats you would normally never write or talk in. Research something and write about it. Write an argumentative essay. Keep a diary. Try to write a book even. It is NaNoWriMo after all.

I am just putting my best guess here but  seems to be more directed toward physical human body and many words containing it are related to the body.   is an example. It means something along the lines of in the flesh as far as I perceive it.  seems to me to be in reference to the collectiveness of something forming a body. For example . We know that  is in reference to writing and  is the collective body of something. The translation of  is ones writing style. Therefore you can see if you use some imagination that it is referencing the entirety of ones writing. You can compare this collective entirety to the word body.Now there is some overlap in my theory here  and  mean the same thing but this is just what I gather from them.  also happens to be a word meaning the body which does blur the lines a little more but I think I got the gist of it.

They are conjunctive adverbs so they can only be used as the first word in a sentence.  is the casual spoken form  is the formal written form and  acts as a bridge between them. So  sounds more formal when spoken and less formal when written.However in English the word But is very wide. In Korean its narrowed down to tons of different particles.  creates a connection between two sentences that shows that they are in opposition with each other.  So for example in English I dont have a sister. But I have a brother. The But would be  because sister amp brother are opposing but related ideas. is an alternative way to say But. It can be used in the exact same way as . But its a little more broad because  can also be used to signal that you want to change the topic of conversation...kinda like Anyway or However in English.  is also little more formal the casual version is .  is a completely different story. Thats the casual spoken form of  which kinda means If thats the case then... OK then... Sure then... or Alright then ... in English. Its used to acknowledge the previous sentence and suggest a course of action. Again these are conjunctive adverbs so they must be used as the first word in the sentence. If youre in a conversation and you use  as a response then youre linking the last sentence that the other person said with the next sentence that youre going to say.

I find some of his entries very motivating in general and also breaks down how every little thing builds up. AS for me Ive been unmotivated lazy and very sporadic with my Korean for several years but the work I did still amounted to something. I started learning Korean in  though that doesnt mean anything since I didnt study consistently. I personally dont have any motivation or desire to learn Korean fast. I have realistic expectations so it does not bother me. If anything I am very content with my progress and my rate of my progress. by the way by LEARNING KOREAN  I dont mean sit there with a textbook or some boring ass scripted dialogue or memorizing flashcards or misusing anki. For me learning Korean is engaging with any interesting Korean content such as TV shows   I hate many korean shows and I am picky. Most importantly I do not compromise and looking stuff up and selectively add words to anki.regarding anki I felt the same WAY with nothing sticking with anki of course something sticks but not enough but looking back I am glad I made an anki deck. I used to do the traditional format of word in the front and meaning on the back. I would do my reviews for this deck halfheartedly and choose  even though I had no idea or  even though I actually dont feel that confident about that word  I knew my answers werent truthful to how much I actually know the word but I think it makes more sense to halfass it than to drill the cards which is not how anki is supposed to be used. I didnt see the point of drilling the cards since you cant ankidrill yourself to knowing the word. Recently this past year I had a breakthrough with ANKI by making cards in MCD format. I had a lot of success doing this with Japanese but my level of Korean just was not conducive to the MCD format. I finally reached that level this past year or maybe I just noticed last year. I blogged about it and I must say anki is indispensable to me at this point. also having realistic expectations is important!   for example its annoying hearing people saying how they suck at speaking or producing the language.  I had blogged about this foreigner person who I noticed was really good at korean speaking in the sense that he seemed to be really comfortable speaking Korean. It seemed to be very natural and effortless for him. I could tell that he got that level because he spoke Korean a lot and he is also social talkative and outgoing.anyways i recommend you find stuff you want to understand or want to  learn from ie song lyrics drama etc.,Korean,ddsv436,-1,t5_2rd8q
