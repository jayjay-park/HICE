182148,0,t1_cez0rp6,Yes that is one way of doing them and I did look into it.  I am using antique books though and the binding was not stable enough to support the weight of the book itself without a solid base created by the bottom cover.  I experimented with a lot of different variations on the linked floating shelf bracket to increase stability while still keeping the hardware hidden.  I tried gluing all of the pages of the bottom book together screwing the bracket into the pages etc.  In the end I just took a simple small cheap metal Lbracket from my hardware store placed the book directly on top of it and screwed the bracket straight through the bottom cover and into the pages.  I had to clamp the book shut in order to keep the screw from lifting the pages up instead of digging itself deeper into the book. So my shelves are not actually truly floating.  If you get right under them at the right angle you can see the Lbracket.  However in this case there are conventional bookcases directly below the floating shelves so youd really have to stick your neck out and twist your head around to get a good look at the brackets.  Im considering masking them with paint to make them even less obvious.  ,somethingimade,cez6m8p,2,t5_2r4wt

The people who work there can help teach you how to read the back of the pattern which will tell you how much and what kind of fabric to get.

1647256,0,t3_2d7crn,Originally posted in rDIY I was told this was more appropriate. A building in Toronto on the eastern side of Church street just north of Queen street was being gutted. I saw the piles of wood and was able to finesse my way into a quantity of planks varying in length with the vast majority approximately  thick. The builder explained to me that this was Virgin red pine from the s when the building was constructed. Im fairly certain that is is pine of that age but have never heard any wood referred to as virgin before. I took his word for it. They were mostly floor joists and full of old cut nails as well as newer ones. After having a hell of a time trying to get the nails out from a previous project I decided that my next project with the pine would be less labour intensive. When my wife brought home some eiffel chair bottoms I thought coffee table. A cut off wheel worked best for shortening the legs where needed. I was not concerned with joining the wood properly as rustic was the main theme. Not to mention nobody with a planer would go near this stuff. What I wanted was two pieces that would come together to form as flat a top as possible. A little gap was no big deal. Once I had the chair bottoms lined up and attached the boards wanted to separate drastically when I would flip the table over. I decided a bow tie would fix the problem. So my first foray into a bow tie was  inches deep and not near as precise as I would have liked. Some cedar shims hammered into the gaps squeezed everything nice and tight but I messed a couple of those up trying to snap them off instead of sawing them off the letting the belt sander knock them down. The resulting white border around a portion of the bow tie could have been much better. The belt sander with  then  grit worked well in creating some contrast on the wood and removing a decent amount of rough material I then finished with  amp  grit by hand before the Lacquer. I lacquered two coats and then sanded with  grit  hours after coat . The third coat dried with no orange peel effect and the lacquer even filled in some of the small gaps.,somethingimade,cjmsthv,3,t5_2r4wt

1817261,0,t1_ck82bfl,thank you.  i never miss an opportunity to throw down a corny love joke.  glad you two are like minded.  very sweet to answer your question about the noneyededness of the owl I decided to leave it that way for a few reasons.  the block of wood had some characteristics that left it kind of asymmetrical.  I took a picture and sketched my original idea for the eyes over the picture on my tablet.  it was extremely difficult to make them even.  I didnt quite trust my hand to manage something that would satisfy me.  two seconds of wood burning mistakes mean  minutes of sanding to erase it.  symmetry aside I was also worried that a small mistake would make the eyesface creepy an event that had ruined a past project. as a symbol of love I wanted to avoid that.  I give her adequate creepiness already . and lastly after going through all those reasons I became convinced that the blank eyes would allow her to perhaps see my eyes looking back at her when she looks at it.  Im pretty happy with my decision and the final product.I gave it two to her on the subway yesterday before our first day of university at separate schools in a new city.  she loved it and so later she let me look at her nude. and stuff.edit wrong twotooto. Im gonna go ahead and blame it on autocorrect.,somethingimade,ck85w2d,21,t5_2r4wt

It took days but I ripped the  inch diameter logs in half using my chainsaw and a x. I then cut small logs for the bases. I cut out precise notches in the bases and in the bottom of the seats. Then I labeled the pieces and assembled them on site. I sanded and stained the tops. The finishing touch was bottles openers discreetly placed on the ends to dissuade folks from opening drinks on the polished bench surfaces. Great use for beetle killed trees the blue stain the beetles larvae leave in the wood give the bench tops a neat look. ,somethingimade,cldoido,3,t5_2r4wt

3341317,0,t1_cp94omd,Thanks!  They werent hugely difficult  more fiddly than anything to be honest but they take a while to actually make. First you have to apply the decals these also took me about  hours to make and let them dry for  hours. Then for me the bit where it went a bit wrong was sealing the decals on so they dont get scratched  these are designed as necklaces so I want them to be durable! The stones arent completely flat so doming wasnt completely successful. I tried varnish too but that didnt give as solid a coat as I was hoping... So yes THESE ones were pretty awkward to get to the stage they are now. I threw about half of them away actually these ones are the best. Two of the gear ones actually dont have anything sealing them theyre just glued on. Those two were quite easy to make! Im still experimenting with ways to get them sealed nicely so if you have any ideas throw them my way! ,somethingimade,cp94v1g,9,t5_2r4wt

Just my two cents but Id try to speed up the first part a bit and then show something about your product.

5631594,0,t3_3s5vzg,Really nice.  Well done.  One small additional step Id recommendAfter you sand but before you wipe the oil on dampen the piece with water and let it dry.  This will pop or burr up the wood grain.  You then sand a second time then apply the oil.  This avoids the wood from swellingburring when the oil is applied and gives you a much smoother finish.  I usually do  grit with a random orbital sander before the water and  thereafter.  You can actually repeat the process and do a third sanding pass with a finer grit if youre ambitious but for this application I wouldnt bother.  For furniture I actually wet sand thereafter with   and  grit using the finish   oil or water based poly  for the wet part.,somethingimade,cwv5hyl,2,t5_2r4wt

6214921,0,t3_40pkue,Hang with me on this one. I play a video game called FIFA. Its a soccer ftbol! simulation. Its one of the very few sources of entertainment in my life no thats not a pity pity boohoo statement Im just a boring person with not very many interests.A few years ago as a result of the progressive nature of my disease it became difficult for me to continue playing this game.The game of soccer requires a lot of sprinting. To command a player to sprint in FIFA you need to press the R button on the frontbottom of the Xbox controller. My atrophied fingers started having trouble reaching this button so much that I thought I was being forced to abandon one of my favorite activities. We make jokes about the obsession kids have with video games but in FIFA I had the opportunity to PLAY A SPORT something Ive never had the chance to truly do in my actual realitybased lifetime.So one day my best friend Pat who if Im being honest fucking sucks at FIFA had an idea the idea being this lets modify the controller so you can keep playing. SMA need not take this away from us.We found a glue gun in the basement. We chopped up pencils. We bent paperclips knifed rubber melted plastic and more. For hours we toyed with this issue.After hours of work we found a solution a hackjob that gives me the ability to press R with a different finger one that still works.I share this with you because I think its important. It wouldve been so easy for us to give up and say Welp Shane cant play FIFA anymore time for something new.Instead we stuck with it. We adapted. And today three years later Im still whooping Pats ass every time we play.,somethingimade,cyw2inf,157,t5_2r4wt

Couldnt even feel it because it sliced the very top layer of skin.gt By the way I think your pictures are gorgeous. I love very close up shots of highly textured things and your pictures of the wands on the concrete?paths? are beautiful.  Thanks! I like trying to take decent shots. The concrete background is the paving stones in my back garden.  I live near Norfolk in England and the local stone is flint which I assume they used to make the pavers. Honestly I opened the patio door sat on the edge and took some snaps while the sun was shining. It wasnt much of a setup! Theyre a nice contrast and Im happy how the pictures turned out. ,somethingimade,d2302xh,3,t5_2r4wt

7698719,0,t1_d3h9j1f,I sleep at night but I do spend a lot of time in my car during the day working on my laptop especially if its raining outside or something. It gets pretty hot in there with the sun beating down sometimes. When I can Im sitting outside but weather doesnt always cooperate.Where it does come in handy in that regard is the occasional stealth camping. Im not a big fan of it but it is necessary sometimes when Im traveling or such to just find a safe place to park and camp. All too often thats right under a streetlight. Walmarts are one of the most commonly mentioned for example but they are particularly bright without some kind of blackout.The other benefit of the thorough blackout is privacy sometimes Im out camping at remote locations with several other people so the extra privacy is super nice. Its a little awkward to spend entire weeks at a remote place and know that everyone around you sees you at all times!,somethingimade,d3halj1,6,t5_2r4wt

Ive loaded all the ones we owned as kids but if he wants to add more he can do it over wifi. If he wanted he could fit nearly every decent original PlayStation game on it as will as Super Nintendo Atari  and so on.

8289497,0,t3_4t11ys,Hello reddit and parents in particular. I created a new business and in all seriousness I would love some feedback. Ive poured my heart and soul into it and finally launched so I would love some feedback. Ive worked alone on this and mostly spared with my wife on it so any outside nonbiased thoughts and criticism are now most appreciated.The products are cute animal sets of stickersdecals I make by hand myself meant to be placed on the in or outside of a childrens room door to give kids another playmate and a nice friendly decoration in their playspace.You might have seen similar before but after looking into what other companies offered I thought there could be a space in the market for me as well as I do think my style is a lot different.The stickers comes with instructions and in many smaller pieces so you can place them freely on your door as you please making them compatible with most doors on the market as well. They are made of quality nontoxic material and wont damage the surface placed upon when eventually removed as many cheaper decal materials are prone to.Anyways let me know what you think and how I hopefully can make this a success  Im feel kinda in the blind here but thats whats fun about starting something like this.TLDRIve started a new business on my own and now would love some feedback as everything is designed on my gut feeling.Ive attached some examples of the designs.,somethingimade,d5dqv79,5,t5_2r4wt

Its rated at all sorts of values but generally around  hours or only  months if turned on  to drop to only half the brightness something to consider if buying it. For anything used for limited time per day then its amazing though!Nice wee designs have you done any more? I particularly like the flamingo.,somethingimade,dcd5kw7,15,t5_2r4wt

Im not necessarily going for a Howto video but more of an entertaining demonstration video.  I however am trying to find a style and always appreciate peoples criticism.
