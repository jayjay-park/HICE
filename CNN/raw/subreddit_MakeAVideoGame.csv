370758,0,t3_1yc7tj,I am a student going into computer science next year and I do a lot of programming in Java. Hopefully I know enough to be able to provide something. I could also try to do a little bit of art but its not really my strongest skill. Id love to be able to try and help just because I hope to be able to get into game development one day.,MakeAVideoGame,cfj70dd,1,t5_30gs1

373688,0,t1_cfjhqtr,Thats an absolutely amazing idea  but what genre of game would it be? We have tried to set a deadline of March on this and this is way to good an idea to waste on a short term project.

375747,0,t3_1ye0un,Missleading title This has been attempted before. However with the guidance of the current mods and our so far incredible community I believe that we are more motivated and better focused on our ideals that we can actually finish this project instead of just expecting it to happen. Great things come from people who see failed experiments and think I bet I can do that better. Im hoping this attempt is the latter ,MakeAVideoGame,cfjpmgx,2,t5_30gs1
375793,0,t1_cfjpohr,Youll do fine then  Java and C are incredibly similar languages but C has a lot less quirks.Another thing to consider is our version control. Off the top of my head weve got Mercurual SVN and Git the latter of which I believe we can get for free along with hosting space on GitHub. But Im not terribly knowledgeable on the subject so any other input is appreciated.,MakeAVideoGame,cfjpsnz,1,t5_30gs1
378572,0,t1_cfjmp4m,gt Consider putting the actual game mechanics as our first priority instead.I think weve yet again encountered the issue where people do not see where game designers are necessary in their game making process so we get pushed aside as the hype train marches on.gt but this is a onemonth gameIsnt this the thread for the big game we are supposedly making as opposed to the month game well be making as a test of our development structure?,MakeAVideoGame,cfk06an,1,t5_30gs1
379529,0,t1_cfk0r25,Not really.  I want more of a Sims feel to it.

381251,0,t3_1ygctn,My vote goes for using unity. Its pretty easy to use allows for us to be using exactly the same software which makes compatablity issues null and exports nativity to loads of platforms.,MakeAVideoGame,cfka5q6,4,t5_30gs1

400703,0,t1_cfmaj82,Yeah I notice in the other comment that you dont want to make it too big to accomplish.

410829,0,t1_cfncew8,It isnt backtracting how you expect. It is a lockandkey game puzzle where locks are barriers to other parts of the castledungeon and keys are abilities that you gain like double jump.Early in the game you will encounter a high platform you cant reach until you get double jump. Play acquire ability return and explore another level unlocked by that door. These kinds of lock and key helps maintain progression gives the player new game mechanics for every key collected and adds a lot of dimensionality to a simple concept.You arent on a treadmill. Progressing through the levels is a puzzle in itself. You will go through the same corridors a few times because of map layout but its a part of the gameplay.Backtrack  not necessarily bad.,MakeAVideoGame,cfnck8m,3,t5_30gs1
