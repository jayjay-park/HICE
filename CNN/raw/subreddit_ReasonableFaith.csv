However the opposite is not true. You dont need a knowledge position to make a nonbelief claim because you cant prove a negative.  If you are agnostic you can still disbelieve a claim it just means you arent convinced by it. I dont know if a god or gods exist but I dont believe because no positive claim convinces me.

Thus something has always existed and that thing has necessary existence.Thus if there are good scientific reasonsor others to say that all spacetime and everything in it began to exist is more plausible than its negation.

Theres cause and effect. There is absolutely no reason to just assume that this applies to the time before our universe existed. It doesnt apply to whatever was outside the universe.

4114845,0,t1_croei88,gtIf we want to make any progress whatsoever on the matter we need to lay out plain and simple what the actual points of contention are. You disagree with naturalism but you do so because of your own personal metaphysical assumptions.I do so for a number of reasons including Its not even a meaningful word anymore  which I provided some serious evidence for. I could have provided more.gtthe physical worldthat which we sense and observeis at least a part of reality thats the assumption I then conclude naturalismI keep saying that that which we sense and observe isnt revealed as physical in the relevant sense certainly not with science alone. Really at this point Ill just drop this bit out Bishop Berkeley was an empiricist.gtI mean youre free to ponders the nature of what truly is beyond what we can observe and measure and reject any notion that this might be reality and it might be a good idea Im not rejecting any notion that this might be reality. Ive simply said that insofar as science is concerned what THIS is  this reality you keep tlaking about  is radically underdetermined. Thats the weird thing  I havent been trying to convert you to theism here. I didnt roll out the metaphysics arguments evidentials arguments etc. Here I am pointing out the necessary limitations of science and the uncertainty that goes with that certainly if were restricted in such a way.See Im a very practical guy too. Part of being practical is knowing the situation Im in what the some data can give me and what it cant. And that means I have to admit the obvious  science beautiful thing as it can be at times doesnt settle anything on metaphysical topics.Edit And one last thing.

5543799,0,t1_cwji8hk,You present a false dichotomy  either allow deaf people to live or dont let them live at all.   There is a third option allow them to live but dont make them deaf in the first place.For any given situation we must ask what course of action is a best fit for selfconsistent behaviour.    The best fit Id argue is the one that can be applied to all persons including yourself.Take for example the Syrian refugee crisis.   I would ask would it be consistent of me to deny asylum to a Syrian refugee while simultaneously granting asylum to myself should I find myself in the same situation?  The answer seems to me that I would be acting in a more consistent way by treating equal members of a set humans of which I am a part in similar ways.  Now youre probably wondering what about the case of a rapist who themselves wants to be raped?   Such a person might say well raping others is consistent with the fact that I too wish to be raped.     My response to this problem is as follows    the rapist is still unfortunately holding two inconsistent values towards similar members of a set.  H may be treated in ways H does not wish to be treated. .  H may not be treated in ways H does not wish to be treated.Where H  the set of all humans  H the rapist  H  the rapists victim  Thus if the rapist agrees to selfconsistency as one must do in order to have any debate at all they must wrestle with this inconsistency.The only avenue of escape is for H to reject .   However this cannot be done sinceA.  It is tautologically true to wish to be treated in ways that one wishes to be treated.   One cannot wish against their own wishes!   Man can do what he wants but he cannot want what he wants.B.  Even if H wished against their own wishes they would still have to deal with the possibility of a Hx who holds the same inconsistent valuation towards H.    This might include but is not limited to a Hx who wishes to hold Hs hand in fire which H is highly unlikely to agree is a good thing.gtBut how do you know radical skepticism isnt the most reasonable position to hold?I would argue that under radical scepticism its difficult to reason at all since the denial of your own senses would entail denial of your own sense of logical reasoning.

9104220,0,t1_d861b4q,gtgtgtWhat would prevent morality from being one of the many ingrained truths of the universe?One approach might be that in order to have any meaning morality requires a person. It cant just be an abstract natural law in the same sense that mathematics or logic are. Nature and the animal kingdom are amoral and if people didnt exist but the rest of the natural universe remained nothing moral or immoral would take place. I think we people in general take morality for granted because it just seems so intuitively built into our very being. But many naturalists agree that any moral intuition we feel is illusory  just a social construct we created to help us survive as a species. Frederick Nietzsche Richard Dawkins and Michael Ruse to name a few. I think its really a tough position to be a naturalist and still believe that objective moral values and duties exist. I guess I want to know if they do exist on naturalism whats the standard by which to measure them?Another problem I see with naturalism is that if I were a naturalist my basis for making truth claims would be lacking. For if naturalism is true then my cognitive faculties are the product of an evolutionary process which is not aimed at the production of true beliefs but rather aimed at beliefs that help me to survive. So the worldview of naturalism doesnt provide the foundation for trusting my own cognitive faculties which in contrast is something the christian worldview does.,ReasonableFaith,d866izc,2,t5_2xgf6
