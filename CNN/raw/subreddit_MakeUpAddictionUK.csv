2406185,0,t3_2mw05f,Are you me? I too am a new ex pat who is having a huge ammount of difficulties in getting her nails to dry. I have some Sally Hansen instadry  suuuuuuuuuure that was still smudgable after traversing around london all bloody day long. I too have tried my OPI with seche vite and it doesnt really help with drying time  makes them last longer without chipping sure but drying time is still forever.  I also tried the instant nail drops which unfortunately didnt do anything. I have made the switch over to gel nails as it is the only thing that works! Sometimes I sandwhich my OPI into the middle of the top and base coat for Gel and that works fine. Because no way am I going to let my  buck nail polish go to waste. If youre interested Bluesky gel polish is around five quid off amazon compared to about fifteen off ebay back in Australia. Also  I think that OPI is much more american based. If anything essie seems to be the top dog over here that is around that price range. Good luck! ,MakeUpAddictionUK,cm943cq,3,t5_319vn
2407130,0,t3_2n0cov,I havent done a course but Ive been to my local college and had things like a hair cut eyebrow tintwax and a facial from the students there so I can give you my experience based on that? The room I was in for the hair cut was like a professional salon but the room I was in for the eyebrow waxtint and the facial which Im assuming was the beauty room was set up similarly to how you described. They showed me my eyebrows in a hand mirror so I could check them and to be fair they did have a full length mirror at the end of the room but it was a freestanding one not on the wall. It was a room full of massage beds that could also be used for beauty treatments Im not sure if theyd do make up in the salon or in the therapy room. If youre struggling to write on the beds maybe buy a cheap clipboard or utilise a folder? You should definitely have mirrors for people to look in when youve applied their makeup and you obviously need them for applying them to yourself have you reached that stage yet or are you still doing theory? Perhaps itll be in a different classroom when youre applying makeup? ,MakeUpAddictionUK,cm98auf,3,t5_319vn

If youre after similar consistency to Smashbox then I would recommend Garnier  Second Blur or Maybelline Baby Skin. Not sure how cheap Benefit Porefessional is but thats also similar. Ive used all of the above including your Smashbox primer and really couldnt read commend Face Finity enough. If you dont mind trying a different texture then try that!

7056641,0,t3_4c8jnu,Im currently using MUFE Duo Mat powder foundation and I really love it on my combo skin somewhat oily tzone that has some nose pore issues. Great medium coverage applied with a brush for more coverage in certain areas I simply stipple instead of buffing or add another layer. I set with pure rose water in a fine misting bottle after applying and it looks like skin instead of powder. Great lasting power throughout the day. Primers seem to make a big difference for me. I recently got MUFE Step  Smoothing Primer and use it only on my nose and it has helped with pores quite well and I use Hourglass Mineral Veil everywhere else. I also tried MUFE Pro Finish powder but after a few hours my nose pores began to show up as lots of small holes through my make up. I used Estee Lauder Double Wear powder foundation for quite a while same issue with pores on my nose. Also used Bare Minerals loose and pressed for years and they definitely lacked coverage and lasting power compared to the EL and MUFE foundations for me. MAC Studio Fix powder foundation is the product I see usedrecommended most by bloggerspeople online I just havent tried it yet as my MAC store is always too busy to get a proper colour match done! If you have a Beauty Blender or similar sponge you can dampen it and use the powder foundation wet. This gives very full coverage though I dont know that it will work for all products.

8727647,0,t1_d6wgi8c,Yeah its a subscription service they have a boutique which they add a couple of brands to every month this month they have ecotools some nuxe and vita liberata and a few products from previous months. You receive  credits for  a month and can choose what to spend it on add more if there are multiple items you want. Each item is typically  credits though there are some at  and I imagine the kat von d ones might be . I think if you buy a  month plan its cheaper you may get additional credits but I stick to the monthly and if there is nothing i fancy in the boutique I cancel my membership until there is. Like I said previously there are a few codes to get a percentage off your first box whichbeautybox being one of them there are others I just cant remember them off the top of my head and if you add all the products to your cart and then go through to checkout but dont pay for it then on my experience next time you long in after like a day they will offer you  off so its only . for the first box and postage. Its good as they have had a few brands lately that Ive wanted to try but not fork out for such as pixie and make up forever and after buying the sampletravel sized items Ive known whats worth the price.
