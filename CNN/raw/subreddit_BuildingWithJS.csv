8634769,0,t3_4trfbu,Tim this is awesome! Im a bit late for the party but Im half way through your part  video. Never tried using git with command line before today was a very fun day as I came along with you and created  repositories using both PowerShell and bash for windows. would be glad to know more about ssh keys. are they none existent in PowerShell? Now that we have bash for windows is there any reason for me to try out linux in general? Thank you very much for doing this.,BuildingWithJS,d6kyby7,1,t5_3fiz5
