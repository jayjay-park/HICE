11623991,0,t3_65v31b,The VirtualBox shared folder option relies on the use of VM Addons which dont exist for DOS. So that option is out.In theory you can try and set up DOS networking and reach out to an SMB share or use FTP to transfer files to the VM.The easiest thing I have found is to just power down and mount up the VirtualBox disk image file. Now I use windows so this is super easy if you made your VM on a VHD file format but I dont exactly know how to do it in Ubuntu.Google search gave me thisseems a lot more complex than the mount VHD option in windows disk manager. ,FreeDos,dgdla6v,1,t5_2zmkv
