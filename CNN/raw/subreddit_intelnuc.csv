6283477,0,t1_cy4cqee,Thats crazy.  Theres nothing wrong with having an external hard drive attached to a NUC and accessing it remotely.The drives will work fine spinning  theyll also work fine if you spin them down.A Bay DLink will bring its own security issues etc.,intelnuc,cz3uzmh,1,t5_378f7
6905988,0,t3_4a9vh1,This is the best tldr I could make original reduced by . Im a botgt In the NUC one of these improvements is support for MHz DDR RAM which runs at a higher speed and consumes less power than the  and MHz DDR that the Broadwell NUC supported.gt The glossy lid is still removable and can be replaced with other lids to change the look of the NUC or to add featureslids can plug into a USB header on the motherboard to add NFC wireless charging and other features and any lid that worked with the Broadwell NUC should continue to work with the Skylake NUC.gt The Skylake NUC holds just about level with the Core i Broadwell NUC from last year give or take a watt here and there and it typically consumes well under W of power even for the most strenuous workloads.Extended Summary | FAQ Version .  tldrs so far. | Theory | Feedback PMs and comment replies are read by the bot admin constructive feedback is welcome. | Top keywords NUC RAM SSD Skylake Intel,intelnuc,d0z434j,1,t5_378f7
8356894,0,t1_d5m3262,Im running Windows  Slow ring Insider preview.Im enjoying it so far. The noise hasnt really been an issue for me sometimes Ill hear a slight fan noise more the movement of air than anything when I stop clicking and typing but thats mostly because the NUC is right next to my mouse at the moment. ,intelnuc,d5m5wvj,1,t5_378f7
9042556,0,t1_d7yrgts,If however they do release it I seriously hope theyll allow powering it up through the Thunderbolt port. Razer Core could totally handle it.,intelnuc,d7yrr3f,1,t5_378f7

10780243,0,t3_5u7erm,I got rid of Skull canyon yesterday as its faulty and got this GBBKiHA instead. More upto date anyway.The i for the  weeks it worked was great at transcodingconverting  though. Thats all i use them for. The Skullcanyon seems to be  in trouble though so make sure you can get refund if it goes tits up.,intelnuc,ddrwjmd,1,t5_378f7
10970019,0,t1_deb7dym,The i does that very well. Coupled with an M. SSD it feels snappier than my desktop which has much better specs i but from an older generation Haswell.,intelnuc,debhad8,2,t5_378f7
10985440,0,t1_decjlgy,I should have clarified that that is what I meant. For basic tasks like webbrowsing launching of apps booting the system launching videos etc...the NUCi feels snappier than my desktop i. Of course for heavier things the i is faster but for basic tasks the i is just as fast if not faster.,intelnuc,ded5xt0,1,t5_378f7

11791559,0,t1_dgwlqg4,Modding is exactly my idea. I am in Germany and the Galactico isnt available yet. Cant wait to get one!  My idea is to replace the heat pipes with small copper tubes and add them to a normal water cooling loop.  My major issue is to get an copper CPUGPU unit that fits  to the FGA... socket. means I want to use liquid metal instead of thermal pads!  In case I would own such a CPUGPU unit I would build my own water cooling chassis.Believe me I am thinking to buy a computer controlled milling machine to make my onw CPUGPU cooling unit. But these machines are sooo expensive!   On the other sideI would sell them to the community   For sure I have some more generic! ideas for this water cooling chassis  For exampleFor sure my water cooling loop will cool also both SSDs by using two long lengthwise pierced copper blocks.I will also designadd an adjustable springmechanism one for each SSD to press the copper block against the SSD using a thermal pad between them.But this thermal pad has only on selfadhesive side for the case I will replace the SSD in the future.Means for the SSD I am forced to use this shit thermal pads instead liquid metal ...  AndPlease note that I worte an email to AKASA with these  and other  ideas ...Hoping they will start to get it seriously ask the community for the need lol and develope such a chassis   WHO WANTS TO START A STARTUP WITH ME? ,intelnuc,dgwm2s9,1,t5_378f7
