4116270,0,t3_37rh7t,Just a tip. On the screen when you select the amount of Holorium you want to use the last one before the live dont touch the screen immediately. Wait a few seconds because your opponent will know you only used one and can use two or three to win.This happened to me a few times and it is annoying.ampnbspEDIT Wait I am wrong it is impossible for them to know if you selected one or more but they know how many you have so it is still a good idea to wait.,Tokyo7thSisters,crphbhq,3,t5_37l05

4441732,0,t3_3bsa68,My strat for raid events. It is mainly oriented towards people who already have good cards but maybe it will help you devise your own strat.Phase Clear the first  areas to unlock the final area middle I dont bother exploring the final area though because its generally a waste of SP and you spend a lot of this event being SPstarved. Unlocking the final area may sound like a waste of time but Ill explain why this is necessary later.If you have strong cards then youre mostly going to be SPstarved during this phase because the bosses are too low level to pose a challenge. Go ahead and use  half SP pots if you want to because youll earn them back during the event.Phase Go back to area  south and spam the  SP zones. I do not notice any significant difference in spawn rate between  SP and  SP zones so its better to spam  SP so you are less SPstarved. This area mostly spawns the tier  boss with the occasional tier  boss. Tier  boss does not spawn here which is important. Your goal is to kill  tier  bosses and  tier  bosses to get  free highpowered microphones.I actually grind the tier  boss all the way to level . It gives about .k EP total and takes me  CP to kill which is about the same efficiency as using  CP to kill a level  tier  boss. The difference is I wont be SPstarved if I farm the tier  boss.Unless you are going for the special ticket you dont want to be killing tier  bosses. This is because of the next step.Phase You should have  highpowered mics now. Try to time your SPCP so youre maxed out during the next special boss period. When its time go to the final area and spam the lowest SP zone I think its  SP. This has a chance to spawn the TIER  special boss. Its very important that you spawn this boss if you want tons of EP. You will probably end up killing a lot of tier  regular bosses in the process but if you listened to my advice they should be like level  at this point and fairly easy to kill off.Once you spawn the tier  special boss poke it once to generate a  combo then switch to your highest attack unit with  cards. You could try coordinating with your friends to get a bigger combo but I dont do this because my friends will just kill the boss before Im ready. Spam all  highpowered mics on it. Depending on how strong your cards are each microphone can give over k EP !!!.This boss has . million HP so you probably wont kill it with  mics. It usually takes  but the th hit tends to be overkill so I only prepare  mics for it. You can either liquidate the rest of your CP killing the boss or just let it rot. Your reward for killing it is like  produce items which you can farm during VS Battlive events anyway doing stage battles. Maybe your friends will kill it. The tier  special boss is not actually efficient to fight using CP.In theory you could farm  tier  bosses for another mic but tier  bosses are so inefficient in terms of EP that I think its better to just spend any extra CP at the end of the event farming tier  or  bosses. I usually just spam the level  tier  boss until the event ends.Note that there are  tiers of special bosses. Tier  always has a level of  spawns in the rd area south tier  always has a level of  spawns in the th area west and tier  always has a level of  spawns in the th area middle. Tier  is fairly efficient to fight with CP. If you spawn this one you can spam CP on it but dont use a mic. The tier  special boss is crap avoid spawning this one at all costs. Its inefficient to fight with CP and inefficient to mic at least in my experience.If youre just starting out then you wont be able to complete all these steps. You can just farm the tier  boss for points to get the first G. If you manage to get a highpowered mic then you can use it against one of the special bosses for a huge point boost maybe you can cut into top k.,Tokyo7thSisters,csqkcke,2,t5_37l05

5608324,0,t1_cws3ala,Yes get that G. But I recommend just spamming lv  Jedah in your case. Trying to get to Makoto to lv  might be more of a hassle that is unless you have active friends that are there to aid your battles. If you do that you might not even need to use up many items. Hows your points so far and whats the single strongest card you use against lvl  Jedah? Just spam her. ,Tokyo7thSisters,cws9mdi,1,t5_37l05

7487459,0,t1_d2s6379,When you say reward do you mean does it add to the amount of times that youve beaten a boss? If so then Im pretty sure the answers yes.

I could ask my friends to fight her and the microphone should show up in my present box when they beat her.If youre referring to event points however you only get what you battle for.
