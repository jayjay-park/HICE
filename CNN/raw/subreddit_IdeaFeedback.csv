2171909,0,t3_2ju7ro,When humans first arrive on the planet Havo they find  races living operating all at very different levels of civilsation. ThThe most primative are the Comoree this race is going extinct and lives in mostly poverty. They have no magical abilities and have low IQs. They finally were thought to be extinct in the th centuary however it turns out  Comoree survived until the st centuary.On the other end of it however are the Osti. This reptilian race live in floating cities. However they arent held back by morals or religon which can cause clashes with the council. They have been able to travel to space for thousands of years. They have plasma weapons and have been working on intergrating magic into their technoledgy for hundreds of years. Their race is future thinkingThe council was founded by the Palen. This race is civilised but isnt very advanced techonledgywise. They essentially have th centuary tech but st centuary ethics and opinions.By the st centuary however they... havent really changed. Their original form has gone extinct and they have taken to living in the forms of other races creating PalenHumans PalenOsti and soon.Finally the Kamili. This race isnt very advanced when Humans arrive in the nd centuary. They are entirely magic based everything revolves around magic. The Kamili are the most religous but are willing to put their religion aside if a greater matter comes up.In the st centuary the Kamili have become technology dependent. Theyre weapons industry is the biggest by far. Theyre combination of magic and science has brought the greatest inventions such as light with mass and pure invisibilty.Didnt I say  you might be wondering. Well The Karian live on a rouge planet inbetween Earth and Havo Which is orbiting proxima centauri. Karian live for entertainment. However this passion has lead to huge differences in quality of life. The lower class work tirelessly to provide entertainment for the rich.In the st centuary the karian have a huge entertainment business. They are big fans of st centuary human televison and have continued to use television since the the humans the Karian and the Havo races all made contact Some point in the th centuary. Karian however have extremely vertical vision so their TVs look very strange. I like to think of their television industry like the Anime industry much less mainstream but has some masterpeices that others couldnt dream of making.Currency in the st centuary Atoms are used as currency known as the molecule system it rounds up the number of atoms to  This is the equivilent of . Things made of light that has been given mass by a process called photonic superconductivity are much cheaper since the new light has much fewer atoms. Real objects are exspensive. The price of anything is decided on the number of atoms it contains. The lowest class people have houses made of light and risk falling through their floors as the distance between atoms is greater light based materials are weaker.The molecule system is made up of  main particles Ha ha get it?Mubble This is  atoms. It is about p and will buy you a single food pillKanu This is  atoms. It is about  and will buy a pure light set of clothesShampu This is . It is worth about  and will buy a real chairFood Food is stored as Dietry pills. These pills contain all the nutrients needed to substain life There are different ones for different races. The cheapest often at about  Mubble will feed you for an hour they have no taste no texture and are simply a white pill the size of a pea. The more expensive ones come at about  Mubble and create holographic food with the nutreints stored inside them they also alow for selections of food from different time periods cultures and races they have the taste of those foods as well. they feed your for up to  hoursReal food is very expensive often at  Mubble for a single grain of rice. Only the richest of the rich have them.Tell me if anything doesnt make sensNote I have two worlds within the same universe that I like to call the Fantasy arc When humans first arrive on Havo And the SciFi arc The st centuary after all the races have formed a conjoined society.,IdeaFeedback,clfwg72,1,t5_32j6h

3385367,0,t3_2yugz3,For nearfuture where governments have been focusing on automated warfare I would take heavy inspiration from Humans Need Not Apply the youtube video talking about automation in the next century. So todays first world countries are very socialist and a small percentage of the population works. For poorer countries I would make each of them wealthier by one or two steps. So Iran is a developed democracy the Congo is a developing nation with infrastructure and England is a marxist utopia because of automation. Then for flavor make a few nations one step poorer instead Id pick Greece  .Transhumanism technological body modifications seems guarenteed for the future but its hard to say what kinds and how it would work socially. It could become a status symbol or it could be viewed like plastic surgery gaudy and fake. Change puts a lot of strain on culture but wealth allows the culture to be outlandish so I would make American amp European cultures weird wasteful and built on pseudoscience. One posssibility is Japan HippiesFor religion Christianity is becoming more liberal and tolerant but Islam is not. Christianity is also declining in American youth I think but Islam is increasing worldwide. I would make Islam a more predominant religion worldwide have it preach family values and make the conservative groups muslim. I would make Christianity a smaller and more liberal religion. Have it encourage whatever strange cultural values you come up with and have it encourage transhumanism and want cooperation with the aliens. And of course atheism is on the rise and will probably be a fair chunk of the population.So todays radical Islam disappears or is replaced by a new cult todays Christianity is replaced by Islam Christianity becomes todays Judaism but stranger to match the culture and all the religious people that barely practice would become atheist and Judaism will probably fade into atheism.,IdeaFeedback,cpe5pj6,3,t5_32j6h
3818183,0,t1_cqrd55r,This is an interesting line of thought. AI itself seems a little more out there than I can work with right now. A very capable Siri would probably the extent of it if I do work with it. gt Artificial intelligence a phone with a personality that acts as a companion and even confidante as well as a repository of information about your life. A phone that will contact your spouses phone to keep them updated if you are in a crisis and dont have time to contact them directly.A device with that much information would be very valuable and vulnerable to any form of spying which is cool. In the ongoing crisis of the plot people do desperately need to know if their loved ones are safe so that knowledge would be catered for. Im starting to think of devices worn in something like a sturdy bracelet that can function as a wellbeinglocation monitor information search and things like verbal communication. The device would be able to be connected to a screen or project holograms. Are interactive holograms too far out there?,IdeaFeedback,cqri4zs,1,t5_32j6h
