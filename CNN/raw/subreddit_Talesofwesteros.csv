243436,0,t1_cf5r0if,The first jab misses but the other two strike true and Martyn takes one jab to each knee. He falls forward and unsure of what Oberyns next move is starts rolling towards his own staff a couple of feet away. Oberyn launches a downwards strike at the rolling Dornishman only missing by an inch. He then lets Martyn reach his staff and get back up. The two circle each other the audience quiet with suspense. Martyn has his staff in both hands. He feints a strike with the right end and immediately steps forward to strike with the left. Oberyn predicts the move and steps out of Martyns short range. However the left strike was also a feint and instead Martyn spins brings his hands together and lets the staff slip through them as he does. He grips it again at the end extending his range to the full seven feet of the staff and as the spin comes to a full circle aims it at Oberyns chest. ,Talesofwesteros,cf5zfxl,1,t5_2zoj7

296651,0,t1_cfbib1f,With a smirk she went to the swords and picked up the long sword. The hilt was cool in her hand and as she lifted it it seemed to be of the perfect size for her. Unsheathing it she rolled her wrist with the sword in hand rotating it in the air. She held the sword in a nonthreatening stance as she picked up the other sword and tossed it to him.I will admit I am not the greatest but I can handle myself fairly well. would you like to cross swords for a moment?,Talesofwesteros,cfbiidu,1,t5_2zoj7

314683,0,t1_cfd9sh9,A Brazen Bull steps forth ceasing the man by the arms. Daenerys was sitting on the throne her eyes fixated on Viserys eying his imposing form. I probably should have warned you She grinned. Or something like that. She stood and before the next Brazen bull could grab him she raised her hand and said Leave him be. The Brazen Bull that had grabbed him backed off and nodded to his queen. You must not know proper etiquette when entering a Throne Room She thought but then realized that he had probably never entered a throne room in his life. She didnt mention it. She leaned down to Oberyn and told him to run off or head down to the Pit early. Oberyn favored to go down to the pit early so Daenerys had him be escorted down by two Brazen Bulls. The streets were loud and crowded at this time of night.You surely must have proof of who you are... right? She raised her brow ever so lightly and watched as he would respond.,Talesofwesteros,cfddwpt,1,t5_2zoj7
318745,0,t1_cfdspxl,Marq moved back away again reaching for his flagon of wine before realising that he had already drunk it all and cursed at himself mentally. Hah well if its that secret you dont have to tell me. He assumed this man was just some Essosi sellsword looking for glory maybe from Braavos or another one of the western free cities. He wasnt sure why he was so serious about his identity though. ,Talesofwesteros,cfdt2fw,1,t5_2zoj7
318957,0,t1_cfdtnxu,Strange. His personal guard was made up of knights and squires as well as some of the best of the City Watch. He wasnt entirely sure why a man of such low birth would reject such an offer. But he was also intrigued by the mans question. You would be correct in that ser. What could a man want from a Knight and not a Lord? Just the one thing. Would I be correct in assuming you have not been knighted? ,Talesofwesteros,cfdtuwx,1,t5_2zoj7
337081,0,t3_1xyc21,To the SeaLord of BraavosI write to you now not as an enemy but as an ally. I have claimed all of Old Valyria through Conquest. Already I have captured Myr and Tyrosh with an amry of  men. Soon the Golden Company will join with me to defeat all the free cities in Valyria.But Braavos is not in Valyria.

Upon entering the chambers he strode over to the balcony confidently. This reminded the prince somewhat of his conversation with Rhae but he shook any thoughts of her from his mind before opening the conversation.Father.
