1421091,0,t1_citt7mp,See thats the problem. You keep saying i have monies. If you have more money that you are able to use to get the housing you need want then USE IT TO PAY YOUR BILLS. If you would like some advice on how to get your credit normal then go check out personalfinance They will be the first ones to tell you over and over again that if you credit is so poor...DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. As I have said before I totally get your point and understand that youd like a place with a door at least. But the key phrase in that sentance is LIKE. You need to lay low and get funds to pay back these little of this little of that and other misc debts you speak of. This should be your  priority right now. Paying your debts and starting at zero. You make it sound like the world just handed you a poor credit score. This is not the case. You did this to yourself with your already addmitted missedneglected payments. What else do you want from society. Actions speak louder than words and that is ALL that companies have to go off of. Do you know how screwed over they would be if they listed to every single sob story about how yeah my credits really bad and what not but I have money and im good for it. No one is scolding you for what happned in your past everyone in this thread is simply trying to help you and make you understand what your priorities and options should be at this point in your life with the information you have provided us. ,fargo,ciuetjg,2,t5_2rf47

2321729,0,t3_2lubzd,For planet fitness they get some deserved and some misplaced criticism.Deserved stuff  They usually dont have power racks for squats just smith machines or whatever theyre called with the bar fixed in rails. Im pretty sure deadlifts flat out arent allowed. Theyll offer pizzaother foods from time to time at the gym kind of counterproductive. They have a fairly stupid lunk alarm thing that goes off if someone drops weights or gets too loud when lifting. I get it to some extent as some people get really fucking obnoxious and over the top when lifting but its stated purpose is to keep other gym goers comfortable and unintimidated not keep obnoxious lifters from being too obnoxious.Misplaced stuff  Their free weights usually dont go as high up as a normal gym. Theres a ton of cardio equipment compared to the amount of weight machines. Why its misplaced... its a gym specifically for beginners. No beginner has any business messing with really high weight dumbbells and cardio machines make sense because thats where most people start when they start getting into fitness.If youre an avid lifter or have a routine involving deadlifts and squats its probably not the gym for you.,fargo,clyoh4q,1,t5_2rf47

The most important thing to remember when finding a psychologistcounselortherapist is that it may not be a good fit with you and them and if it isnt then find a different person.

They have been decided at the federal supreme court level and the governor of ND has zero power to change that. So if the governor has zero power to change it why get hung up on it?The governor cannot outlaw gay marriage they cannot outlaw abortion. They really have ZERO influence over those issues. For example lets say I watched making a murder and thought the subject of the documentary Steve Avery was innocent. Then I proceeded to ask every ND candidate if they thought he was innocent and  only voted for candidates who thought he was innocent. That would be absurd right? The governor of ND has no influence over a Wisconsin court case. They could do nothing about it. Its outside their jurisdiction.Exactly like gay marriage and abortion.

It wont surprise me if he is actively looking for a position somewhere else so he can get out of NDSU before his reputation is complete mud.I also think the Forum and its entities are very bitter about first NDSUs attempted ban on them from their events and then the derogatory remarks that Bresciani made towards the Forum and their staff. ,fargo,d67tauw,8,t5_2rf47

But  it has the potential to lessen the burden on the public by providing more front line psychiatric services. Which could lessen the amount of ER visits ambulance rides and PrairieJamestown state hospital stays. Which lessens the financial load on the VA Medicaid and insurance companies.And if I dont want to pay the taxes I can just go across the river for my smokes.,fargo,d940yyv,0,t5_2rf47

Some fields repurpose words as field specific jargon ex many words have a different meaning in legal contexts then they do in general contexts. In this case a dictionary would suffice.Fact is an interesting word because it has two slightly different definitions depending on if youre discussing fact vs opinion or fact vs fiction. In fact vs fiction a fact is something thats true and a fiction is something thats false. But in fact vs opinion a fact is something thats provable and an opinion is something thats impossible to prove or disprove. If I said the surface of the sun was C that would not be an opinion it would also be incorrect a false fact.,fargo,dbszr3n,3,t5_2rf47
