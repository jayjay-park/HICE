3566412,0,t3_314a9m,The Spinning Top is a very weird album for me because I adore the last three songs This one Far from everything  and November but the rest isnt doing it for me. Bittersweet Bundle of Misery is the best song to start with IMO.,blur,cpyspwp,2,t5_2rsxb

9454524,0,t3_5a7gjx,I say go to Parklife! Its funky and fun. From there you can explore their other true Britpop albums Modern Life is Rubbish and Great Escape I know Great Escape was a flop but I love it. Then delve into their more experimental albums Blur  and Think Tank. Its kind of cool to listen to their first album last and see where it all started. I hope this is a good guide to Blurs albums! Happy listening!,blur,d9eff11,5,t5_2rsxb
