11784502,0,t3_66bzi7,Hello Jon!  Thanks for posting this.A little while ago I was taking a look at reimplementing functionality of some of our existing onprem SPD workflows in SharePoint Online using Flow.Several of these involve creating SharePoint list items or documents based on an approval or other input but I frequently need to specify the Content Type of the item and the default actions for working with SharePoint items dont seem to let me set this in any way.Am I stuck doing this by making HTTP calls or am I missing something obvious?,MicrosoftFlow,dgvt8l7,2,t5_3egg0
