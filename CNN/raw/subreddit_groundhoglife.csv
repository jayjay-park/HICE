11597453,0,t3_65ieu2,HelloBeen playing the game for less than  minutes and Im extremely impressed. Not like many others Ive played  it just sucks you right in!Is Patreon a possibility? You can make the development more communityled with polling for featuresUI modifications earlyaccess for patreon donators things like that.Ive never set this up myself though have heard of dev teams bringing in  per month not sure what the split is with this. The advantage you have other these folk is that youre game idea seems far more scaleable than others Ive seen and will cater to a larger audience the Patreon games Ive seen are mostly NSFWoriented.People will get addicted to this game in a major way and I think you should leverage that.,groundhoglife,dgakvrr,7,t5_3k0u1

11634630,0,t1_dgesohl,I decided to just get my research to  instead of doubling.. works I suppose although these last few levels have been slow.I wonder if costs are the same across skills.,groundhoglife,dgesqms,1,t5_3k0u1
