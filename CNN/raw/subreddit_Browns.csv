If we take QB first I really like Brandin Cooks at .With the QBs its hard to say whos the best out of all them and I think their value is ballooning because of the position they play. Im absolutely shocked that I havent heard anything about AJ McCarron I think hes worth a look and is more proready than any of the other four. I could easily see McCarron surprising everyone and going in the first round. I dont think any of the guards are worth a top  pick. Yankey is the best of them but nothing from the tape really jumps out as a musthave prospect. Theres much better value in the rd or th with Trai Turner or Dakota Dozier.,Browns,cgkbxr0,2,t5_2s1wh

We draft Watkins and our offense has high level weapons in every spot.  Gordon Watkins Cameron Hawkins Tate and toss in Travis Benjamin in  WR sets.  That leaves this team needing a guard and a QB and the offense is set for  years.  Regardless if Gordon leaves in .  What Im really hoping happens is we snag Watkins at  and hope we get Fuller the CB from Vtech at .  I think Hoyer is serviceable with the right talent and coaching.

He has been asked some ridiculous questions there has been soo much hype around him and he has kept his cool always putting his team before himself and giving credit to his past teammates.I guess my point is we have to take all these guys at their word until they prove something on the field.

Nothing indicates that he was in stage  at the time of his recent failure I do not understand why the media keeps saying that except from getting it from a MKC article where she asks Gordon if the next failed test is a year ban and he says he thinks that is what it is and believes so.

1093503,0,t1_chsgdv8,One of the first tips I always tell students is dont try to be an entrepreneur simply so you can be your own boss or because you want to make a ton of money. If thats the reason you get into entrepreneurship you are doing it for the wrong reasons. Im not saying that you cant be successful with this method of thinking its just not the most recommended way of doing it   Find a problem that you want to solve and be passionate about it. For example with my current company I knew that there had to be a better way for city governments to connect with the residents and visitors of their community. So I built a company based upon solving that problem.    In order to be successful it takes A LOT of hard work and its not an easy ride. Being an entrepreneur is an emotional roller coaster of highs and lows. Sure money and success comes along the way if you do it right but only if you work hard and earn it yourself because at the end of the day no one is going to hand success to you.   When it comes to your career you have two choices. Either find a job or find a customer.  Question everything and dont let anyone tell you that you cant do something because the only person stopping you is you.  P.S. GO BROWNS  ,Browns,chsl2u0,3,t5_2s1wh

But seeing as that is probably not going to happen Im going to go out on a limb and say that none of them are nearly as talented as he is. And you act like Farmer et al. didnt know about Gordons suspension. The Browns FO went into the draft knowing Gordon would likely be out and prepared as they saw fit. So the argument that were fucked goes against at the very least Farmers thoughts on the issue. And even with everything youre talking about those are all sunk costs. Follow me on this We cut him Best case He never plays a down in the NFL again. Worst case he comes back and turns into a HoFer for some other team.We keep him Worst case He never plays a down in the NFL again. Best case He turns into the best receiver in Browns history.Plenty of middle ground between the best and worst cases but given the above Ill gladly sacrifice a roster spot at the mere chance to have a guy who had  yards off  catches and  TDs while being thrown to be Weeden Campbell with no running game and Greg StoneColdHands Little opposite him.,Browns,ciqgo2q,3,t5_2s1wh

It would be a perfect time to ramp up the punishments for domestic violence. The NFL has a precedent of giving out lightno suspensions for domestic violence charges but the Rice incident blew up because there was video of it.

Awesome.gtWhat? You kept arguing why Manziel was better than Hoyer? And you kept saying how Hoyer hasnt wowed you. Has Manziel wowed you? Doesnt appear so with that comment.I never said that either one was better than the other just making the argument that they both have a shot at starting.  Im not at training camp Im not in the locker room Im not in team meetings Im not in the film room and Im going to guess you arent either.  Im going to disagree with anyone that says either one definitely without a doubt needs to start because none of us are in there seeing everything theyre doing.  I said Hoyer could come out and do well or he could go out and not do well how does that not make sense?  Not everyone speaks in absolutes like you seem to.  Youre putting words in my mouth so you can act all outraged.Hoyer played alright for  games that could be an indicator of two things  .  Hes a backup and backups should be expected to start a couple games and not lose them before defenses have enough tape on them to counter them. .  He didnt have a lot of time with the first team and played decently well for a couple games before building a rhythm.  With more time with the team he could come out and become better. I dont know which one it is either one is a very definite possibility.  I dont give a shit which one starts Im not rooting for either one to start over the other.  I just want the coaches to pick whoever they think gives us the best shot at winning and I then want that person to be successful.  Id love for our biggest QB problem this season be picking between  good QBs.  Im arguing with you because youre making statements like Hoyer played unbelievably well when he had two alright games.  He barely beat the Vikings with  interceptions a team not exactly known for its secondary and then beat the Bengals because the defense held them to only  points.  ,Browns,cjnll6p,2,t5_2s1wh

And we also have a new ILB who is apparently AMAZING in drop back coverage so even a slot receiver in a  WR set wont even be able to get a quick  yards.  I think the Browns D is about to dominate for years.  They are so young so good and so deep.  We have so many starting caliber linemen we dont even know what to do with them.

1790837,0,t1_ck4mev0,The problem is Manziel doesnt have the play to back up his attitude. Hes a spoiled little brat who lashes out when he doesnt get what he wants and the Browns fueled that fire by signing him.Seriously the kid looked like someone ran over his puppy when he wasnt drafted top  and then had the audacity to beg the Browns via text for a job to stymie his shame. And the Browns responded by trading up to get him?? WHAT KIND OF TEAM DOES THAT? Only in Cleveland.This ridiculous hype train and his attitude have put a target on his back and when he does hit the field its going to be like blood in the water for DEs.

I believe that the value of having the ball during the final possession of the game cant be overstated. Lets say theres around  minutes on the clock its a  point game you have at least one timeout and youre on offense within your own . Your main objective shouldnt be to grind the clock down as Wilcots recommends it should be to get into the opponents territory using as LITTLE of the clock as possible. If you cant make the first down you punt the other team then tries to preserve the clock during their drive and with some luck youll get another chance on offense with a minute left if your defense cant hold. Maybe I just say that because I have more faith in our offense than our defense right now but I still think thats a tall order for any defense.,Browns,cks51o6,1,t5_2s1wh

2122089,0,t1_cl9jq9j,I think the author confused zone blockingrun with zone read. Hoyer doesnt run the zoneread offense but Manziel did in the preseason. The zone read is basically read option plays that Kaepernick Wilson and RGIII run where you can hand off or have a QB keep depending on what the defense is showing. I dont really know enough about the zone blockingrunning scheme to explain it but it works really well for us when we run those misdirection plays.This would probably help way more than I could explain.,Browns,cl9kb2n,4,t5_2s1wh

2163554,0,t1_clesz79,Agree. Even the QB sneak has a  success rate across the NFL. Its almost impossible for a D Tackle to stop a center from getting a few feet if the center  qb know what theyre doing and the DT does not. Set up I formation with  wideouts motion the wideouts to draw the ILB outside gives yourself a gap to rush the QB or Agnew  Cro a few feet. Easy peasy. IMO.But yeah throwing play action to Cameron made no sense I think thats what the end call was I dont remember. For as much shit as people have been giving the running game yesterday the passing game was arguably worse. Oh well. Im happy that the head coach  OC are pretty aggressive at least.,Browns,cleu5pk,2,t5_2s1wh
2192432,0,t1_clig0ha,Let Pettine and Shanahan make the call next training camp.  Im so glad theyre waiting to make the decision because I think it will take a whole season to make a good decision.  Hoyer is still early in his career as far as number of starts.  Over time defenses will learn to adjust to him especially if he plays as well as he has except for last week.  Best case scenario would be Hoyer plays so great that its an easy decision to sign him and start him next year but if he trails off at the end of the year then we go into the off season with a QB competition and start over.,Browns,cliifyy,4,t5_2s1wh
2193074,0,t1_clikpqn,I understand where you are coming from but they either have to trade Manziel to recoup the pick or start him. Hes worth a second rounder to at least  of the NFL.

Roll the whole thing up like a burrito cover with crafty bacon weave add more pork rub to the outside and cook low and slow with a light hardwood smoke. Brush some bbq sauce on it about every  min.

2437420,0,t1_cmcyrwm,gt And if we make the playoffs? Yank Hoyer?This is part of that thing called discussion Im talking about.  We havent made the playoffs yet what weve seen is streaky play out of him where he worryingly gets very close to losing to bad teams before coming back to win it at the last second.  Will that sort of thing work against playoff caliber teams?  Will he improve and start playing more consistently?  People have their opinions about the answers to those questions and telling them to shut up and enjoy the ride is counterproductive to the entire point of a football discussion forum.  Does he squeak into the playoffs then fall on his face when he goes up against a good team?  Do we pay him next year hoping he improves or cut ties and hope we can find a QB that has a higher ceiling?  What happens if we pay him and he doesnt improve?,Browns,cmcyyik,1,t5_2s1wh
2440125,0,t1_cmczm1m,Yes. Hoyer was a great game manager the first  games when Mack was in and our Running Game was on point.He was the last starting QB to throw a pick.

He now has  picks.I still defended him because it isnt his fault Mack got hurt... until last game.Unforced errors all game. We dominated the Falcons in all areas.

2543265,0,t3_2ou2d8,Well Couch had the most talent out of those  to be the franchise quarterback and for a season  it seemed like he was. But injuries caught up with him and we all know the rest. He also played for an expansion team with very little talent and played for  very underwhelming coaches fuck Butch Davis.Quinn was a bad pick from day  and was just an overrated and overhyped quarterback in general.McCoy was a rd round pick and had shit all for talent around him.Manziel is walking into a situation with a good pass blocking OLine two talented running backs pro bowl receiver and tight end and he can make plays with his legs. Add in an offensive coordinator who knows how to use rookie spread QBs and a very level headed coach and I think Manziel is in the best situation of the . Weather he lives up to his potential or not is up to him but I think he has the talent within and around him to succeed. ,Browns,cmqjinc,18,t5_2s1wh

We ran  less plays this game and the offense just sat on the sideline.  But I can only assume Johnny didnt see open recievers. The INT by Kirkpatrick is the same shit we got Luck with. The INT to Pacman is a welcome to the NFL moment. We will see  games lets see if he falls apart. Remember when OSU lost to VTech?I really would like to see PFFs grades on this game when they come out. As they tend to be the most accurate reading of a player.

Worse case scenario he is a back up best case he plays all year like he did at the start. Part of his downfall was the injuries on the team most people seem to ignore that.Unless there is a better deal on a better back up Id say dont let Hoyer walk. What team would want him to start? If they do it will be one of those struggling teams that are possibly mismanaged. Tho Texans might be his best bet ATM.I guess I can see him wanting gaurenteed starting but if he isnt willing to work for it... Ya no one will want him on their team.,Browns,cn2bewz,2,t5_2s1wh

3906114,0,t3_34yxbj,Thanks for posting!! There is a lot of good things to see in this video but still room for improvement. There are two plays he makes what I consider very poor judgements and one that is just a bad throw. The play at  while it does end up a completion was a bad decision and lucky it was not intercepted. To compound the bad decision the receiver breaking towards the left sideline had just become wide open. There is another throw he makes to west that look very similar but incomplete man open on the left side but he never looks and he attempts to force it up the middle. However two bad decisions out of that many is not damning. The one thing I have large concerns about is his ability and willingness to go through his progressions especially to his left he seems to heavily favor the right side then the middle with little attention to the left on plays not moving in that direction bootlegs ect.. That being said he shows some good arm strength and decent accuracy barring the absolute miss of dray on the  yard dump out over the middle. He has some things to work on but I still believe he can iron it out and become a starting caliber qb.,Browns,cr1j51z,1,t5_2s1wh

Also the team will get a compensatory pick for getting him and letting Hoyer walk.  That said Im certainly not too thrilled about him being the best option we had available for what the team wanted.  Hes not exactly a proven talent hes been mediocre at best his entire career but I dont think hes nearly as bad as some Tampa fans would want you to believe.

5066586,0,t1_cuwnni5,Our system wont be much better. Our lines way stronger but our backs and WRs are bad. I just think McCown is a bit of a loose cannon. Hoyer is more poised and was a better fit for the offense.,Browns,cuwpr04,1,t5_2s1wh

5078314,0,t3_3kjwsh,Alright Ill play along.The Team is better at DB DL OL Health  Depth WR Hartline gt Austin and QB PFF indicates McCown is  more accurate than Hoyer. They are possibly better at RB as well the jury is out on that.The OL features  pro bowl caliber players teams with  pro bowl caliber OL are almost never terrible. Despite what we saw in the preseason there will be running lanes for the Crow and Johnson Buff and TB have monster Dlines most others dont. Before Mack went down last year we led the league in YPC I see no reason to think that wont be the case again this year.If camp reports are to be believed then Gabriel and Benjamin have taken big steps forward. Hartline is a Pro and an upgrade over Austin and Baby Hawk is a good slot receiver. If McCown is a lateral move from Hoyer then the offense will be fine if it stays healthy. I think they key to a successful season will be whether or not McCown can lead this team on game winning drives like Hoyer shows the uncanny ability to do. Although at times those drives were needed because of Hoyers inconsistent accuracy earlier in games.Overall I expect the offense to be at least as good as it was early last year with a chance that the improved accuracy from the QB spot makes it much better. I just dont see how it is going to be worse short of QB being a disaster. The D is in the second year of this system and should fully understand the scheme and assignments on every play. Last year we had the best pass d and according to pff the best secondary in the NFL. The addition of T. Williams and continued maturing of Desir and K. Williams makes this unit better. The LBs are pretty good with a healthy Dasby and Kirksey is looking to me like he may be prime to break out. Mingo is under rated against the run and is an outstanding coverage LB. But the engine will really hum if the Dline can live up to expectations. Teams could not pass on us last year but once Dansby and Taylor went down they ran all over us. There is a good chance that will not be the case this year.This will be a top  D by the end of the year top  if they can find a way to generate a consistent pass rush. The schedule is tough on paper but there is just no way to know until the games start getting played. Cinci Denver SD Balitmore Pitts and Stl are all teams that could take steps back and Oak Stl and KC are all teams that could be far better than advertised.

Its kinda like how some people play for fun others play to win and others play to play well.Some fans just want wins. Nothing wrong with that. Winning is fun losing blows.Others want to win but also want to see great execution in a game. We cashed in on a lot of mistakes by the Titans and came out lackluster after the half. Sure we can celebrate a win but Pettine and the Browns will definitely have some film to look at tomorrow.Same thing with optimists realists pessimists etc. Then all these types of fans come together on rbrowns and go at each other.

Do you think that after watching one teams system for two years learning how each receiver works watching the tendencies of different divisional rivals defenses and most of all studying a quarterback would perform better or worse than if he were to start from scratch? To me its just common sense. It sure as hell wont hurt the quarterback but theres plenty of upside in doing so.

5755801,0,t1_cxah4hk,Gilbert is another factor in coaching. From multiple reports Pettine grew disillusioned with Gilbert immediately and stopped giving him legitimate practice time. On paper Gilbert was still the top cover corner and its been said more than once that Pettine lobbied for that pick anyway.Same with Bowe to a smaller extent. I didnt like the acquisition anyway but OBR I believe reported that Pettine hates Bowe and wont let him practice at all with the starters despite him being healthy. To me thats not a front office issue thats a coaching issue. Its a coach being too caught up in his own bullshit to play the guys hes supplied with. Pettine is making some sort of defiant stand and its just going to get him fired. And yes I would take Manziel over Bridgewater at this point. I wasnt even a fan of the Manziel pick at the time nor am I that much of a Manziel fan now but his numbers are comparable to the aforementioned in their first five starts as well.   completion for Manziel compared to  for Bridgewater and  for Carr.   TDINT ratio for both Manziel and Bridgewater . rating for Bridgewater . rating for Manziel and thats with the injury in the Carolina game.Carr is harder to make the case for because hes physically gifted as well as smart and humble and basically turned that team around himself and has had a great career thus far. I dont think Id take Manziel over Carr but I can see why the pick was made  Carr had system QB fears and poor competition throughout college. Manziel had size fears but played against top competition his entire career. ,Browns,cxak8im,1,t5_2s1wh

5766656,0,t1_cxbwai1,My point is that I would not trust a fucking word Manziel said at this point. It is not about being overprotective or not. Pettine has to deal with an owner who more or less hand picked the kid his job basically hinges on Manziel and the dude fucks up at every turn. I mean seriously you just got the nod to start the rest of the season and the first fucking thing you do is piss in the coaches eye!!??? If I was Pettine I would be beyond pissed off. He is getting canned or even if he doesnt I imagine he is calling up Shanny and asking him for power point tips. Either way if I was him I would tell the FO that I was refusing to play or even let Manziel practice unless they take full ownership of him. Dez treatment the kid and if he fucks up again then cut him free. ,Browns,cxbwnfm,1,t5_2s1wh
5766945,0,t1_cxbvvae,Moving on from an irresponsible player who cant play QB at the professional level is never a bad thing.  The written statement from the FO saying they support the decision means that there may actually be a consensus for once.  It means that we might not be firing everybody after only two years.  It means we have a steady QB that while not spectacular can be used to evaluate the other talent on that side of the ball and identify other possible needs.  It means that we are not letting ourselves be held victims of the sunk cost fallacy.  It means that we have a coaching staff that actually follows through and does what it feels is best for the team going forward.  It means the Browns are actually functioning like a functional organization.  This is all good stuff.Everybody wants to see Manziel play hell even a part of me wants to see him play and Ive been a pretty consistent critic of his that never wanted to draft him in the first place.  We want to see him play for selfish reasons because hes hyped because hes Johnny Football.  The reality is the coaches see him a whole lot more than we do.

What should be taken into account is  number of incidents  the offense  talent of the player  age and contract  if the player is someone who you can count on for the futureI know certain teams instantly get rid of trouble makers which the Browns usually do and refuse to take on trouble makers. There are also certain teams like the Cowboys who dont give a fuck at all if the guy can play then they do not care at all what they do off the field. I am not a huge fan of that but then again I want to win so fuck it take every rapist and murderer as long as they are a probowl caliber player and cheaper than normal. Just keep those fuckers away from me when not on the field. The Steelers got rid of Holmes before his contract went up it had nothing to do with talent or number of incidents. They kept Ben because he was cheap and young and they hard lined the fuck out of him to keep him in line for the future. We kept Gordon this long because of contract age and talent. I have no issue with it even though he is an idiot. Tate got the boot last year for being a locker room cancer once again no issue with it because he sucked anyways. ,Browns,cxc8yzn,2,t5_2s1wh

When he faced tougher PAC defenses like UCLA Stanford and Utah he threw too many interceptions.  Too often resorts to dumping the ball off when the holes in the back end of the defense are smaller.Cook  Doesnt do well when the defense is in his face inconsistent accuracy holds on to the ball too long and tends to force throws.  Tends to forget his footwork and tries to use his arm to make throws.  Doesnt throw the ball well when forced to run out of the pocket.Lynch  Product of the hype machine.  Lynch never really played against an AllAmerican corner to challenge his throws.  He has a long whiplike release that is hard to unteach.  Ball doesnt come out very clean most of the time usually has a wobble to it thus losing the velocity needed to get the ball to the receiver quickly.  Inaccurate on medium throws.

We arent establishing depth we dont even have adequate starters at every position.We dont have a unified vision now we shouldnt keep doing this.  Find a new general manager who believes in having offensive weapons and building around a prototypical QB.  Again the bengals never went below  during the beginning of Lewis tenure.

6007915,0,t3_3xrixj,The game is very different from when Brown played. He was basically the biggest and fastest guy on the field back in his day. The most important thing about Brown was his balance and foot work that is what got him extra yards and made him very difficult to take down. Lots of guys are athletic freaks in college but in the NFL basically everyone is. Henry is not a good NFL prospect at all not even remotely close. There is nothing special about the kid he is above average at pretty much everything outside of his catching ability and that makes him great in college but makes him average at best in the NFL.He runs with his pads high has average feet average balance average at best vision average at best quickness below average lateral quickness when he does get to top speed it is average at best and he does not have the power to run over large safeties even at his size since of course he runs standing straight up. None of that is easily fixable or fixable at all.  Guy is a third round or later pick there are too many other RBs in college who look like their skills translate to the NFL much better than Henry. ,Browns,cy7638p,5,t5_2s1wh

Now we find ourselves with so many holes to fill and its because we tried so hard to get QB we missed out. Drafting a QB isnt going to instantly make us a playoff team. We have a lot of holes to fill.

6233546,0,t3_40xjcf,Lions fan in here. Just my two cents.I think that he would be a good adition to the braintrust you are forming there he doesnt have an ego problem and reportedly he meshes well with people. Also I think he would be willing to be that glorified scout role the GM should have in Cleveland in the future.He left a bittersweet taste in Detroit after his tenure as other have said he was good with the home run hires and draft picks but he also had big strikeouts. He has shifted over the years from drafting high risk high reward players Titus Young Nick Fairley Jahvid Best to sticking with an infamous BPA strategy He passed on Aaron Donald and drafted Eric Ebron. Also he insisted by the end of his tenure in drafting squeaky clean character players which I think was good for the team.Anyway his final demise was the fact that he had the stench of the Matt Millen era in him as he was his underling during many years the horrible start the Lions had this past season mightve been a wake up call for Mama Ford and he blew up any remaining pieces of the Millen era by firing him and team president Lewand.Anyway I kinda liked Mayhew and I believe he would be a good fit in a limited role just as the Browns would offer him.,Browns,cyy6pwm,6,t5_2s1wh

Tired of watching the Browns shell out top dollar for B or C list free agents like Paul Kruger or Scott Fujita and then being surprised in two years when we lack young talent and have a need at those positions. Im content signing depth and niche players for need as opposed to shelling out big contracts for players who arent going to be worth them in three years.gt Good teams dont have  year plans after a downturn.Bad teams are teams that dont have a big picture. Theyre the ones like Tampa Bay a few years ago where they sign big name free agents in an attempt to immediately get better instead of being patient and investing in the draft. Or like Cleveland in .gt I would argue that a major cause of our perpetual state of suck is constant year plans and no one willing to hasten the process the way successful teams do.Or it could be the fact that our front offices have four year plans but none of them are around long enough to see it through.

I disagree with like all of this man. We offered Mack M so we are offering a ton. Also early PreHaslam Browns spent money HaslamBrowns hasnt. Lately the precedent is for us to lose more players than we get and spend very frugally. This isnt something new this FO started Farmer did it too.I have no idea why the Browns pulled the deal for Mitchell but neither do you. Reports said it was a negotiating tactic which obviously backfired since his own brother said it did. Agents arent upset we arent overpaying they are upset we extremely hesitant and it is hard to do deals. Beat writers for Cleveland say there is no way to paint this as a success but half this sub wants to.gtIs retaining free agents more important than setting a precedent that were not going to overpay for them? Personally I dont think so.Sashi wanted them and three of them wanted to be here. They mostly were pieces that can keep while rebuilding who would still be in their prime years when wed make it. If we did overpay wed still be about M under the cap with  people to cut still to get to  players and two years on only  player wed need to resign aka a lot more money to the cap space. ,Browns,d0u6uqb,1,t5_2s1wh

6889547,0,t1_d0x7xfm,Khalil Mack was drafted in a year that was not supposed to be top heavy at all. Hindsight is  with how good those QBs have looked now. Bortles was a surprise pick at  that no one expected and the next QB after him was Manziel. But they still got the QB they wanted at the top of the second.  The same thing with the Jets and Williams except two QBs are picked  and  and then the next QB is taken in the rd round. Best talent available is BS at the very top of the draft. How many safeties go top ? How many guards or centers? Will you be happy if the Browns pick a center at  because he is the best talent available? If there was an equation for picking in the top  of the draft it would be something like talent  position x need  relative value to the team. If you are drafting a safety in the top  you better have a need and he better be talented. Same for guard Center and ILB. But if you need a QB then the guy you have rated as a mid  guy gets pushed top  or even nd overall. Maybe you end up with a Matt Ryan instead of a Manning or maybe you get a Ryan Leaf. But its like Michael Scott once said that Wayne Gretzky said you miss  of the shots you dont take. If you dont have a QB you need to take shots until you get one. The Browns just havent made smart decisions drafting QBs before but I think that was because of a terrible front office situation. That doesnt mean that you should stop trying to draft that franchise QB.,Browns,d0x8x5j,1,t5_2s1wh

Trading anything more than a fourth round pick on a retread is a bad idea considering the fact that we have veteran QBs on the roster. Bear in mind were drafting a QB somewhere in this draft anyway so that vet we trade for keeps the seat warm.. People were sad to see him leave because he wasted his potential on partying as a first round draft pick. The guy left the team with a poor reputation in the eyes of some fans around the league because we did not coddle him the same way other troubled players have been coddled..

7273104,0,t1_d24rk6x,Bullshit I despise Johnny Manziel but I just got home and got to finally see the pictures that everyone has been blabbing about on talk radio and what do I see some stank ass dirt weed at best st picture and some of the most considerate partying ever based on half the parties I went to growing up.The second picture of the dining room table had  beers on it Oohhh....I had that many on my chest at any point passed out at rental properties with around  all together from me and about  other guys and from the looks of the table it only needs a wet rag and someone to dump the dish and wash the plate.The fifth that looks like Jack Daniels has hardly been hit hard hell in my early s I would have done more than what was out of it all by myself not counting anyone else along with the Hennesy that looks to had two drinks is all made out of it is all.The tall thin brown bottle I dont know what it is but from shape alone I would expect it to be a fufu girly drink and therefore not much alcohol content overall I would assume only around  proof at the highest but yes the big bottle of what I would assume is rum has been hit pretty hard but not more than what  guys could easily drink in a night even being lightweights without being too bad off. So overall for superstars this haul of drink is quite modest compared to what my friends and I did week in and week out in our early s whenever we could all get together.I have seen mushrooms many of a time it was a big thing in my high school growing up yet even blowing that picture up to  in my inch monitor I could not even begin to claim those are shrooms it looked like there was mushroom like objects there but there also what looked like food on the plate so it could just be a meal and totally not of the magic type that everyone is so quick to jump the gun over.Shrooms dont look like portabella mushrooms most of the time they look like half dried dirty brownish white pathetic things on most North American strains yes there are colorful ones but ive only seen true ones that were red once and yet seen the others  times so usually they dont look appealing at all to eat and from what I seen on the plate those didnt look like that but it was very pixilated when I tried to get is zoomed in enough to identify so I totally disagree on the shroom call. Not enough evidence without a better picture for me to say it was the naughty type of mushroom.Overall this is one of the mildest after pictures of a party I ever seen me and just two other buddies did worse than this alone much less add in millions of dollars and a few more buddies and a bunch of bitches hell that place would have been TRASHED.I had disliked Johnny Football from the first so never followed much his partying stories. But from the  pictures posted from the article if those pictures supposedly make Johnny Football out to be a out of control party animal the I guess my friends and I were fucking Satan Mephistopheles Beelzebub and Moloch out slaughtering nations.edit forgot to comment on the coke residue yeah thats exactly what coke residue looks like so yeah I think that one was the only photo that actually shows any evidence of crossing the line overall I would say the rest is fucking mild by far but I have to say even the coke residue looks pretty mild Ive seen bigger leftovers many of a time and at the time none of us made over hr in todays dollars hr in the late s early s I would have expected a bigger mess when you have millions.,Browns,d24wixb,7,t5_2s1wh

7336572,0,t3_4fukng,My big personal opinion is that I would rather not draft RB in the first round. . RBs dont last very long in the NFL. You get a limited number of years with peak performance from them compared to other positions.. A team with a strong passing game behind a great QB and average RB is FAR more likely to go all the way than a team with a great RB and average passing. Look at the last  Super Bowl winners and youll see that a majority of them were carried by elite QBs or elite defenses with mostly average RBs. Today you need a decent RB that can do his job you dont need an elite RB.So Id rather use those first round picks on guys that are going to be contributing for a long time at more important positions. Elliott is a phenomenal talent. I just dont think it makes a lot of sense to use a first round pick on RB.,Browns,d2c491p,8,t5_2s1wh

If not either of them then Treadwell could be the third most likely option.  I think they can hope for Doctson or Bell at . and Davis Fuller or Cravens at ..  Cravens Lawson and Bosa all seem like they have weird physical measurements for playing OLB in a .  I would prefer Cravens at SS.  Bosa seems like he might be best off bulking up to stay an end while Lawson seems like he should slim down to become an OLB.  It may not matter as much as I think its just that none of them seem like true fits.  Lawson or Stanley would be my pick among players Im expecting to be available.I dont think teams always feel that a visit is necessary.  Maybe it depends on the position theyre drafting.

This is a guy who needs to be the final piece to the puzzle at the end of the day a guy that draws defenders off your Hopkins Greens etc. We dont even have a pure second option and Fuller is not particularly going to make anyone stop and account for him particularly with younger QBs or a guy like RGIII.Fuller if he goes to the right team will be just fine but ultimately dont like his prospects in Cleveland.,Browns,d2fkzoi,6,t5_2s1wh

CBS may not have had him on the rankings but who is to say that some other team had a similar grade as we did on this kid?

7442469,0,t3_4h7uc4,I think the case you make for drafting prospects that are less athletic is actually not a trend that necessarily was focused on. I think Rashard Higgins is clearly the possession receiver in the group so athleticism can be made up by his length and ability to get the ball in the air. Jordan Payton is a crisp route runner who can create separation without speed. Scooby Wright was a straight flyer and he kind of reminds me of Chris Borland or even this years draftee matakevich. These guys run on a high motor and have incredible instincts so speed or SPARQ is really not a crazy important thing to have if you have good instincts.

When we sit here and wonder why Whitner said exactly what happened around  other teams where able to read our mail and could what we in when we were in it and what we were going do. My favorite quote ask Hue Jackson how he felt about our defense since he had to scheme for it.We had some talent before and itll be very interesting to see how this pans out.

Hue knew what was going on and gave players who were likely to go every chance to succeed and save their jobs.  None of Gabriel Moore or Jennings did anything fantastic out there.  If they had maybe they wouldve stayed.   It appeared that much of the preseason was spent on playing borderline players to see if they could either make the team or get some value in a trade.

8860840,0,t1_d7cxaie,gt I feel like this last year there werent as many QB prospects as there are now.Honestly because there werent. The fact that were even debating now on Kizer or Watson number one overall is a sign of that. Last year who stood out at this moment? Connor Cook I guess? But even then he was never a consensus number one guy. Christian Hackenberg never was either. Realistically you could see four QBs go in the first Watson Kizer Kaaya Kelly. There wont be because I dont think that theres going to be that sort of need but the fact that those four are all getting first round hype  with Watson Kizer and Kaaya getting early first talk  is just a sign that this class is just deeper and better. Its fair to question whether Goff would even be the third QB off the board. Hell depending on how you feel about KizerKaaya he may have even been number four.,Browns,d7cy4yv,2,t5_2s1wh

The biggest thing thats tempering me from having the same worries at least right now is that the Cowboys have established coaches schemes and the Eagles and Cowboys have a good amount of solid veterans on offense.  Guys that know their jobs and arent trying to find their way along with a QB that needs some time to develop RG is basically in reboot mode or should just be a backup Keenum is an alright backup nothing more.  Not to mention the Eagles defense being solid and giving good field position.  At this point Im just rolling with the idea that Wentzs size and athleticism allows him to start right away while a sitting Goff could have a better ceiling over time until that idea is proven wrong.  ,Browns,d7l2hai,11,t5_2s1wh

Why the fuck do you knee it there? The only logical explanation is that Hue has such poor confidence in his quarterback and Oline that he was worried about taking a sack.

9402575,0,t1_d96pb21,None of the QBs have any wins.  Kessler hasnt done any better or any worse than any of the other QBs that we can tell.What we know is that RGIII played against the toughest defense so far in terms of points given up.  The Eagles have the best defense  the Patriots are close  the other  really dont have great defenses  the Ravens a little better than the other .The Browns got Kessler to not suck at throwing short passes.  And the Browns got what they wanted.I think wed be happy if we could have the running of Hogan Pryor would better at running  and Hogans passing was as bad as Pryors worst start and the passing of Kessler  but one or the other hasnt been getting the job done.The defense has been worse than the offense  and the offense is lacking weapons like Corey Coleman and Josh Gordon who could be coming back  perfectly healthy at any time without warning like exactly when RGIII gets back.  Im not trying to bash Kessler but its not like Kessler has been outperforming anybody and its not like Kessler cant be said to suck in some respects but not all he definitely doesnt suck at the one thing that the Browns wanted him for  throwing short passes accurately.  Too many fans love dink and dunk so much that they dont realize that dink and dunk just isnt enough to win.  Im personally extremely tired of watching dink dunk punt loss.  Not just this year and not just the Browns but in the NFL over the course of years.   Dink dunk punt loss is the worst kind of football there is.  The most tired generic pointless football.  Ill take the heaviest QB you can find  and  oliners blocking and see if you can move the chains.   yards might be a chore  but . yards might be guaranteed.   Anything but dink dunk punt lose.  You can get a QB who can throw it  yards and all you do is throw it  yards.  You might get picked off a lot.   And the QB will likely end up with a garbage passer rating.  But if you hit on a few of those  youll get some points.  And at least its not dink dunk punt lose.  Logan Thomas could be both the biggest QB you can find and one who can throw  yards.  Pryor has a bigger arm than Kessler or Hogan  Hes heavier than any QB on the roster.NFL teams have an insistence on short accurate passing and they dont care if they can throw long or run.  And short accurate passing isnt enough.   Pryor and Logan Thomas both can run and throw long passes.  Thats  of .  Neither is likely to win the short accurate pass competition especially Logan Thomas.I heard dynamic offense  which made me think not the dull generic dink and dunk offense  but what weve been getting is not interesting.  The Hogan running was interesting but Id rather have a heavier and faster version but Hogan is there.The Browns with Hogan and Pryor in the backfield  doing innovative things have an extremely good chance of beating the Jets  who have scored fewer points this year than the Browns.If the stat line ends up with Hogan with something like  passing for  and Pryor is at  passing for  total   not unrealistic maybe there are  TD passes and  ints.   And if Pryor has  runs for  and Hogan has  runs for  thats  yards on the ground.  Add in Crowell and Duke   up the middle  TDs on the ground.  TDs total.   yards passing  TDs  yards rushing  TDs.   plays   runs   pass.  Maybe  rushes yards for CrowellDukeVitale.  Hogan rolls out right  runs or throws  Pryor goes in motion before the snap  takes a pitch and rolls out left  runs or throws.   Hogan and Pryor.  And  other players who can either carry the ball well block or both.  Maybe some of the catching specialists  who are good no doubt like Barnidge who isnt really a blocker though in any scenario that Ive seen  can sit.   You can have Vitale out there  who can do more than just catch.  He can also run and block.  Do a lot of sweeping left or right.  That might magnify the threat that the misdirection provides.  Look at Stanford vs Washington State  Hogan was running right or left with student body left or right a lot of blockers.  Not every dman is going to chase Hogan right with pulling oliners when theres a threat of Pryor going left.  And that will give the Browns a blocking advantage on the right and Pryor a lot of empty space on the left.The Browns could have a lot of good athletic college QBs on the roster right now if they had been doing what Ive been suggesting.  What theyve been doing is putting pocket QBs back there who cant run who apparently get hurt every time they get sacked from the pocket.  And then they replace one with the next.  Hey a not fast not big Hogan can get the job done running  imagine what a faster andor heavier version Pryor  Logan Thomas Jason Vander Laan  Vad Lee  John Roberton Tre Roberson  Jacob Huesman  Keenan Reynolds  Nick Marshall can do.  People are pretending that the bottom of the barrel is being scraped and maybe it is  but these names Im typing are the same name that I was talking about for udfa in May.   Jacob Huesman same FCS as Wentz  ran a .  at  pounds and .  He didnt really get a look from the NFL but you cant argue with . and .  The Browns shouldve gotten Driskel when he was cut.  I thought the Browns shouldve gotten whatever QB the ers cut.  Their QBs havent been good either  but they arent getting hurt quite as much.,Browns,d97ucx9,0,t5_2s1wh

9704151,0,t1_da95fzf,Id like to see players on the field who help with the run game.Ive mentioned this before  but back in the old days  there were  run threats in the backfield.  Currently  many teams only have .  Dinking  dunking  occasional generic run.   The entire offense is predicated on having a medicore QB doing something complicated well.  All decisions at this point are made to make that generic pass offense work well.   And it doesnt work well.  They can make a different set of decisions to help the run game.  Having RGIII in there will help the run game.  Another run option on any given play.  QB FB LH RH.  T Formation.  LH and RH could be split or in the backfield.  LH and RH should be able to run routes split  or in the backfield carrying the ball.It is harder to quickly assess  WRs running routes than it is to assess  WRs with max protect.   Run most of the time  put a lot of quality run blockers out there and have them block.   Runs easy passes with blocking and occasional very long passes.  I would see Duke as a LH or RH  someone who could either be split wide or in the backfield  either running or catching a pass.   What he is not is a good pass protector.  There should be a fullback or a blocking back back there blocking.   Duke is not a good blocker.  And thats a problem  if the plan is for Duke to pass protect change that plan.,Browns,da98thr,2,t5_2s1wh

He still a tech so he will get double teamed at times but this leaves tech Ogbah to shine. Overall it will probably be better for us and our defense because now LB is less of a need we already had  good LBs and in a  this means that all  can fill a spot but we are missing safeties and CBs and if those arent fixed we are more in trouble than we were before.

Coleman hes got promise Ill say that. But to me hes just a bigger Travis Benjamin slot type receiver. Hes never IMO going to turn into a true no  wideout option which is fine..he can still be a productive player but at  I am not looking for a slotno WR.

So you think Wentz looked better and his numbers werent bad for a rookie numbers that are pretty much on par with Kesslers.Except in Kesslers case the numbers make him look better than he was for the reasons noted above which you ignored.gtAlso Wentz would have had a better year with the Browns than with the Eagles.

Also Kesslers numbers were inflated for the reasons I noted above which you ignored...again...gtLike I said Im on the fence but if I were you I wouldnt commit to anything past the eyeball test because when you start claiming that Wentzs comparables would have benefitted by being a Brown you lose credibility.Obviously you just want to respond to make believe arguments instead of what I actually said.

Including all the celebrities that sports media just loves to have on television every chance they get.Not too mention all the Patriot fans who say Brady showed Roger. Wont SB despite his suspension. To that I say the suspension never put the SB in jeopardy for the Pats. He missed the first four games. He was going to still play in  of them and they were still going to make the playoffs. And he wasnt suspended for the playoffs. Just about everyone still had them as the pick for AFC champion despite the suspension. In the long run it was simply a short vacation for Brady.

10721404,0,t1_ddlttyl,gt Then why was Barnett just as productive throughout his career as Garrett?Except he wasnt. On a per snap basis Garrett had more pressures than Barnett did. Barnett may have had the pure sack numbers over Garrett but hes not as impactful in terms of overall pressure. gt Doesnt it make you at least question if Garrett had better athleticism it should equate to more sacks and qb pressures?He did have more pressures on the whole so...The biggest thing Barnett has over Garrett at this juncture is hes a bit more far along technique wise and hes a bit more disciplined at defending the edge. That being said even though he had more sacks than Garrett Garrett was the better pass rusher. Add in the fact that not only is Garrett more suited to playing in the pros due to his athleticism and size but also due to the fact that Barnett is much closer to his ceiling than Garrett is and its a pretty easy decision between the two.

My preference would be to wait a year anyway. Thats mostly because of how deep the draft is with defensive talent. Our defense was atrocious last year. Far worse than our offense in my opinion. So Id rather stock up on defensive starters and depth and see where the offense stands with the new revamped Oline. If Kessler progresses I think he will be serviceable. We hung around in a lot of games last season and played many solid games up until the half before blowing it with lack of depth because our offense couldnt stay on the field and our defense was gassed.

Also if youre asking about improvement by keeping those three then the answer is not a lot.  Maybe we win  or  games by keeping them instead of . Just like I dont think that signing Zeitler and replacing Pryor with Britt makes much of a difference either.I was all for the tank last year and if we dont get a QB this offseason then Im all for another tank this year.

11419858,0,t1_dfqa4kq,Good points all around. Agreed Allen could fall especially with potential shoulder issues. Its also rare for an OT to not go in the top  so I assume someone will get selected earlier than anticipated.I also think youre exactly right on Howard. Its hard to tell where TEs will end up. I think hell go top  as well. Too talented of a player.I think the wide receivers depend solely on where the first one gets taken. If one goes early the others will be close behind. WR hungry teams will be afraid to miss out and could cause a run for the position group. I could see the same happen with QBs depending on how teams rate the position group.The other wildcard I have is Hooker.

11560137,0,t3_64zwwg,Im really happy you mentioned the bad hip drive and footwork on throwing.Mitchell seems to have great footwork for the pocket and an athletic base. But his actual throwing mechanics are in some ways just as egregious as Mahomes. Theres little engagement with the legs and hips. Theres little arm rotation. He mostly brings the ball from the shoulder to his ear then throws. Which means his throw is very limited in how much of the body thats actually being used. I think that is a big red flag when under NFL defensive pressure. Ideally hed be using his legs more hips more and have some sort of rotation with his throwing arm where he brings the ball down back then up. He is a bit better on long throws. But you still see very poor hip engagement. Which might be another reason for how often he underthrows deep passes.I dont think his problems are that easy to fix. They will make him too selfconscious. But I also think they result in him not handling pressure well resulting in a lot of errant throws and interceptions. ,Browns,dg6cgo9,4,t5_2s1wh

11654826,0,t3_66b2go,One thing I never see addressed in these sorts of analyses  although I dont know how youd do it  is the effect of bias associated with where a guy is picked.  Clearly guys picked early have a higher rate of success.  But how much of that is due to them being simply better players vs. having earlier and better opportunities to contribute and develop?  To some degree any smart NFL team does its best to let the cream to rise to the top.  In principle whether a guy is an UDFA or a top pick once he gets into the position group none of that matters and the best players play.  However a guy picked early is most likely at a position where theres an opening and is likely to be at least penciled in as a starter. And probably gets more attention from the coaches first team reps etc.  Maybe some lateround or UDFA prospects are brought in to bolster the competition but Id need to be convinced that they dont have a much higher hill to climb to win a spot.  The only way to test this would be to have the FO assemble the team without the coaches knowing anything about any of the guys where they came from what theyre being paid etc.  Then throw all  guys or whatever into camp and let the coaches sort it out.  Of course that would never happen but Im be extremely curious to see how strongly the external factors draft position college success previous work in the league correlated with success in that case compared to the typical numbers like what this article investigates.Maybe coaching staffs are far more efficient that Im imagining at letting the best guys play and the difference between the best and fifthbest CB in any given class is that big but Im not convinced of that.  It seems like to succeed as a laterounder or UDFA you need either a bunch of injuries in front of you to land on a team with a gross dearth of talent or just be so good that you blow the coaches minds.  So when one of those guys fails is it really that he just wasnt that good or that he never really had the opportunity to show what he could do?,Browns,dgh37ri,3,t5_2s1wh

11697385,0,t3_66x4uh,Selection AnalysisJon Gruden Ill tell you what Mel I love this pick. He just does it all. Hes a great inside presence when he is able to ship those Washington brews. Whether it is sending out a cream ale or switching around and shipping a pale ale his delivery is spectacular. And you know I love me some amber ale Mel. I might go have two myself right now!Mel Kiper Jr. Youre right about that Jon. But what surprises everyone about him is his ability to send quality imports. There isnt a lot of tape on this guy he just started this year and no one really paid attention. But lets break down his tape. Right here look at his recognition that newcultking may not have quality German beer. He selects packs and delivers a quality Hofbrau Original Thats going to hit the spot when it is really needed. And here he notices that although Cleveland is separated from Canada only by Lake Erie it takes over  hours to actually get to by land. His reaction? Send a couple toughtoget Canadian beers. Regardless of what you think about his experience that is a veteran move that will translate well into the future.Louis Riddick Couldnt agree more Mel. But where lowlvlpeon has flashed the most in his short time is his responsiveness to questions prior to the draft. My sources tell me that in predraft questions he was told that Belgian ales were a preference of newcultking. lowlvlpeon took those words to heart and really went above and beyond to fulfill that preference. Here you can see that he send a good amount of Belgian triple ales showing that he can ship quality and quantity. But does he stop there? Absolutely not. He comes back on the other side and delivers variety with multiple brands straight from Belgium You know newcultking is happy with that selection.Trey Wingo Its an A pick for me. And what I like most about it is the little flair that he adds to the shipment. Beer is great but how are you going to put your touch on it to make it extra special? lowlvlpeon shows prolevel judgment by sharing a piece of his history in the form of a bottle opener In its simplest form its a tool to help newcultking open all of the great beers that were sent in this shipment. But lets turn it over and see it from a different angle Its unique its special its not something you can easily get. This seemingly little gesture is what sends it over the top for me.Mary Kay Cabot I dont like it at all. I think newcultking should trade it and all future DD selections to New England for Jimmy Garoppolo.,Browns,dglx0xe,8,t5_2s1wh

Sacks and usage in run game might be taking a toll. Increase in short pass attempts from  to  this year reason for higher completion numbers. Accuracy on intermediate and deep throws dropped sharply. Pocket poise has been compromised. Hyper aware of pressure around him and lacks awareness to slide and find temporary shelter to make throw. Concern over pressure too often trumps ability to get through progressions. Must speed up the pace of his reads. Footwork is a mess. Slight stride onto stiff upper leg with little weight shift. Restricted follow through and too often tries to muscle throws with upper body. Throws to target rather than leading or throwing them open on shortintermediate throws. Too respectful of underneath coverage and must be more willing to challenge the defense. Needs to improve anticipation.Dak had a lot more issues than just off the field issues. Wilsons biggest issue was his height.  Actually dak and Wilson really arent that much alike.,Browns,dgog9m1,4,t5_2s1wh
