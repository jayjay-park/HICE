That is literally a spruce plantation completely man made doesnt even look like a real forest. Maybe its because I know that outside of that picture it will go on in the same flat land in rows until eventually we come to one of the roads that form a checkerboard pattern every  meters or so then maybe we will have a square of another type of forest or more likely just a clearcut area.

You could probably post an Ansel Adams original here and people would call it photoshop if they didnt immediately recognize it.Magical looking images are possible. The cynical of view people here and on reddit in general makes me kind of sad for them.Its just so much better to take it in on good faith. Internet life has an extra sparkle to it. And in cases like this where it has no opportunity to do damage to you or anyone else why not just believe?,EarthPorn,cfmglth,3,t5_2sbq3
402706,0,t1_cfmi0dn,For me a traditional artist is anyone who manipulates real penspencilspaintclaystone and paper. I have a pretty liberal definition of it though  If youre creating it in the real world with your hands for me its traditional. Photography is a bit different in this sense and digital art even further down that path even if it has the same result as traditional art youre not physically manipulating the medium.That said youre absolutely right about daguerreotypes and the schism they created. Though eventually and fortunately for portraiture people gained a new type of appreciation for painted artwork. Unfortunately for photography as youve said the line between real and manipulation will continue to blur as technology advances it will get harder and harder to tell the difference. Though i think people will still innately be drawn to photography as they are painting.Perhaps there will be a second revolution of film. And people will be putting actual filmstock on display instead of the resulting prints. Its pretty easy to go from negative to positive film ex slides.For me art is art and if it appeals to me in some aesthetic or technical way it is beautiful. Sadly our view is not yet that widely held in regards to digital art oftenespecially among art critics. The dynamic will continue to change no one can stop that I just hope that as I said in my original posts people will begin to appreciate it for what it is and not go around vilifying it because it may be manipulated.Currently saying Photoshop is nearly a synonymous indictment of it being fake. Just appreciating something for what it is is where the real sparkle and beauty is. Its a lot happier of a thought to believe it is real even if it might not be.,EarthPorn,cfmi8uo,1,t5_2sbq3

Pretty much no cool fjords in Sweden as well. Denmark... Well its flatter than a  year olds chest so forget about it. Finland while not in Scandinavia is also rather flat. Finland Taiga shitload of lakes and a tiny bit of alpine tundra up northwest.Sweden Taiga temperate forest south lakes mountain close to the Norwegian border and a bit of alpine tundra. The Swedish islands down south are very beautiful during the summer. Norway Taiga Oceanic climate from westrainforest as well to north along the coast lakesmany are mountain lakes plenty of mountains and valleys tundra in the north and in the mountains fjords mountain plateaus and plenty of islands .

Many ancient cultures have had conceptions of a flat Earth including Greece until the classical period the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Near East until the Hellenistic period India until the Gupta period early centuries AD and China until the th century. It was also typically held in the aboriginal cultures of the Americas and a flat Earth domed by the firmament in the shape of an inverted bowl is common in prescientific societies.Many otherwise great civilizations believed the world was flat.

Their problem is real and has nothing to do with the amount of water in the US or the world for that matter. Their problem is that theres a finite amount of water that flows from the Colorado River. Their primary source of water. When they made the agreements on how to divvy up the water the population was much different than today. The population of Vegas and its surrounding area is approaching  million. Los Angles which also gets their water from the Colorado has almost  million people in its metro area. San Diego is over  million. Its a wonder the river hasnt run dry already. Even if the river wasnt effected by the drought it doesnt change the fact that more and more people are demanding water from the same source. ,EarthPorn,cj5xts3,0,t5_2sbq3

I never called the  number.  I think my uncle did for one part of the first Police Quest.    However I honestly dont care what they did to make a buck.  They made great games and deserve every penny they earned.  I was a kid without an income during their peak and my parents didnt like to spend money on computer games.  I played many more pirated versions of their games than I bought.  Also having worked in a creative industry now for nearly ten years I have a better understanding of these practices.  I have to fight every day for the welldeserved money that pays artists salaries buys the necessary equipment to do the work and keeps the lights on.  There really isnt anything left after that.

When the lake freezes over in the winter the methane bubbles get trapped under the surface of the ice. It is actually a big problem in areas with permafrost and is a good visual representation of what happens when warming affects the climate even if it is only by a few degrees.

2620897,0,t1_cn0jm7p,I have swam in some of the icecold LakeSuperiorbound waterfalls in northern Minnesota. I found out the hard way that waterfalls create smooth deep underwater scourholes where the falling water has eroded the rocks underneath the surface of the water. Once youre in that scour hole its very difficult to get out because the swirlingfalling water seems to pull you back down into the underwater hole. On one occasion as a stupid teen I thinking it would be like a waterparkadventuretypeofthing if I stood near the edge of the falling water. Instead I slipped as a result of smooth rocks and swirling water and it was like a dump truck worth of gravel falling on me.Not recommended. Keep a little distance between you and a waterfall.

2711786,0,t3_2r44rw,Yes! Neist Point! Easily my best memory of the time I spent in Scotland.Going to Skye from Edinburgh was the last thing my girlfriend and I did before leaving Scotland. I was quite reluctant because of the hassle of hiring a car and driving so far in a place where they drive on the wrong side of the road just kidding and the general dislike of doing things that comes with being fed up with life but in the end we did it. When we got to Neist Point it was cold and raining and the wind was loud in our ears and it blew in a mist from the sea so the rain tasted salty. It was not as pretty as the photo but in a way it was more beautiful. With our clothes soaked we climbed down the dangerouslooking stairs and walked to the lighthouse trying not to die on our way because of how strong the wind was. And there staring into the ocean and the thick mist I was reminded to never listen to myself again.Sorry but thinking about that place still brings a tear to my eye.,EarthPorn,cncbi33,8,t5_2sbq3

3009604,0,t1_co9owgz,Actually when I read your explanation in the previous reply I understood that your first language is not Vietnamese or at least you were raised in a English speaking country. The reason for that thought as I mentioned is that you look at every single sound in the word when for the general Vietnamese who are not familiar with Western languages they dont hear those sounds or when speaking dont pronounce the secondary sound in the word.The most important thing when you want to get a Vietnamese to understand you in my opinion is to pronounce correctly the general sound I really dont know the word but for example in this case you said that gop is close to cc but i think when I hear it its totally different because yours starts with a g or for your last word domdome which to me it will be m or m or om no where near ng which have a . and ends with ng and nd is to get the accent the pitch? correctlySo when you say Damn Cock Bitch Dong I imagine it will be something like am Coc Bt oong when a Vietnamese hears it the first word if you replace it with a t sound it would be really close even if its sounds like Tham and I think its easier to understand than Dam gop bik dom even though the rd word sounds almost exactly like bch because what I hear will be am gp bch om.Anyway just my  cent worth I am really no expert.,EarthPorn,co9xyw4,1,t5_2sbq3

3275590,0,t3_2xndkj,Im sure youre all aware of the horrific situation that faces refugees in Syria Turkey Iraq and Kurdistan. Fortunately most of these regions can be reached by international aid organisations and the United Nations. However there are sadly some exceptions to this. I will be going back to Rojava over the Newroz period.The region of Rojava Western Kurdistan Syria is a blackhole in terms of assistance for refugees and since I last visited the region vast swathes of land and with it many thousands of refugees have been liberated from the Islamic State.The charity provides assistance for all refugees in these unreachable regions irregardless of religion or race. They play a vital role in preserving the lives of those who have escaped the threat of terrorist organisations.With little international focus hope is dimming for the people of Rojava Sinjar and Kobane and many will die as a result of this shameful neglect by the international community.I cannot justify the pain expressed to me by so many who have suffered at the hands of ISIS by attempting to explain it with words  You can see it in their eyes.We have raised  Euro so far. Please donate and help us care for the most vulnerable. This is a photo of two adorable but terrified children I met on Mount Sinjar Please consider donation to my campaign for the official charity of the region the Rojava Aid Project ,EarthPorn,cp1n6wk,2,t5_2sbq3

My first year here I learned to surf and it changed my life. It wasnt the surf culture but that it allowed someone to access nature in a way so few ever do. I have some of the most awesome shots and they came from waterproof singleuse cameras from WalMart.You could compare this discussion with a pretty girl. She can be really pretty with a bunch of artificial makeup colors but put that same girl with a fresh outoftheshower face and wet bed hair...well thats natural beauty that doesnt need saturation help.,EarthPorn,cpharm2,3,t5_2sbq3
3413104,0,t1_cph0enk,Theres a few ways to fix that. Essentially its happening because youre exposing for one part of the image at a time and when one part is superbright and the other quite dark it means youre trading one for the other a lot of the time.For DSLRs a lot of people use graduated neutral density filters and circular or linear polarizing filters to tone down the skys brightness a bit. Otherwise I can suggest shooting the same shot at different exposures one a little dark one normal one light so you can get a good shot of the darker land and a good shot of the sky and then put them together in a HDR High Dynamic Range program. Some use Photoshop but Ive found Photoshop is a little clumsy with HDR compiling and I could use recommendations for a better program.I also suggest using RAW instead of JPEG format and then tweaking the BlackWhite and ShadowsHighlights of your image. You might be able to salvage a lot more from your image than youd think.,EarthPorn,cphbhaf,3,t5_2sbq3

3655125,0,t1_cq8whw1,Ha  you maybe had a better experience at the top than I did. We were there in good weather and the crush of bodies mainly western tourists was intense.  But what was wild was how superficial everyone seemed to be.  Im sure many of them had read in a Lonely Planet guide how seeing the sunrise at Sri Pada was the thing to do.  However it clouded over just as the sun was crowning and obscured the sunrise.  The crowd just drained out of the shrine despite from my perspective how beautiful the cloud cover was. It was thin and striated and picked up the sunlight like maroon fire.  It was gorgeous but I guess didnt fit the expectations so everyone just left.  Gave me an hour at the shrine nearly alone to watch the morning ceremonies.And as for mangoes hell you might be right.  I guess it was more symbolically disappointing being that mangoes are one of my favourite fruits and they were one of the only fruits from my mums home country that I didnt get to try.  ...Though I did get my fair share of durian.  To the dismay of my pops no doubt.,EarthPorn,cq8wrvz,2,t5_2sbq3

If you are leaving San Francisco over the Golden Gate Bridge the first or second exit will allow you to go through a tunnel and west.  There are roads and trails some that overlook the Golden Gate Bridge back to the city.  If you keep going west youll hit a point and have to turn north if you keep going you can walk a little ways to a light house at the mouth of the bay.  A little bit north if Fort Cronkite and this shot is from nearby that area.

When we got to the peak there was  visibility beyond our immediate surroundings so sadly we didnt get any sort of vista at all but we were still pretty damn lucky because it was just such a bizarre otherworldly scene. When we finally got back the car we found out that Tioga Pass had actually been closed while we were up there so the whole ride out we were the only car on the road.,EarthPorn,csxqz5u,1,t5_2sbq3

4555404,0,t1_ct4sd6l,Thanks for the clarification I think I better understand what youre curious about. Yes I object to Photoshoped as a blanket colloquial term for the digital editing of a photo its necessary to specify that its a photo because the term edit can refer to video or animation etc.. Its true that color correct is what the effect within photoshop is called which I think is why youre calling it a tool. However color correcting a photo is a process not just a tool. Again I didnt say anything about certainty so Im confused why youre using that word again. The saturation of the color is precisely what everyone is talking about. Adjusting saturation is one of the fundamental processes of color correct. Thats why I said color correct is a more appropriate term. Like I said before the term photoshopping only gets under my skin when people use it as a blanket negative implying that the image is somehow a dishonest representation. It also bothers me because there are many programs other than photoshop which allow you to do the same basic color correcting. So I guess its just the context and an accuracy thing. I hope that answered your question.,EarthPorn,ct4tv79,1,t5_2sbq3

4816459,0,t3_3gsrl2,Okay th generation native here responding on all the Colorado folks hate visitors and recent transplants.  We dont hate people who want to live here but we have a housing shortage along the front range because of our big flood and some traffic congestion from new arrivals so there is some complaining but its not a huge deal.  Heck in Boulder in my neighborhood they get invited to block parties and were happy to help them out when theres flooding and fire the same as everyone else. As for visitors theres long been a dislike for Texans because they come to ski country flash money and brag too much about Texas. So we have made Texan jokes about it but do we throw them out? No we keep bringing them nachos and selling them lift tickets.  The Californians show up in waves and often insist theyre more hip than we are and make fun of our clothes. So we make Californian jokes but do we throw them out? No we dont even point out that at least we dont jail people for partaking of herb.  Overall you can tell we like tourists since we help them read  maps rescue them when the get lost in our mountains and gently get them to their hotel when theyve had too many edibles.   Peace and you are welcome in colorful Colorado.,EarthPorn,cu1nk0e,1,t5_2sbq3

The reason its inverted is because youre looking in the direction of the sun no away from it. The bottom part of a rainbow is hidden so to say by the Earth. If you look at a rainbow and imagine that it existed behind you as well then when you turned around to look at it you would be able to see the bottom curving upwards it would be a halo surrounding the sun.

5752103,0,t1_cx9xiv3,That that entire landscape is a foremost example of an inherently destructive process.  Alpine glaciers have a tendency to dig downwards on their accumulation slope.  This is due to their bowl shaped cirques tendency to gain snow mass above the frostline after which they shove older ice downslope from the weight of new firn above.  The result is the transition of gently rounded mountains into the jagged peaks of bedrock on display here.  Further downstream youll see the transition of narrow river valleys with selfentrenching meanders expand into broadly rounded valleys.Of course all that happened when human technology was only a little more advanced than scratching his ass with a stick.,EarthPorn,cxa3qil,4,t5_2sbq3

The temperature rarely peaks past  theres no humidity to speak of and were surrounded by mountains volcanoes the Puget sound rainforests and rivers. Best of all despite the rainy reputation this part of the world gets its nearly bonedry in the summer too dry last summer the whole state was in a drought.And youve just reminded me how badly I want to get out to Yellowstone. ,EarthPorn,d0f1xte,26,t5_2sbq3

The longer the straight line the less physically likely that it was formed by nature then having  straight lines all meeting at   degree angles... All Im saying is this was probably carved out the odds of it being natural are slimtonone.Even in your case with the hexagonal stones you have a tessellation hexagons appear everywhere in nature and I would argue that is support of lack of straight lines why didnt the stones crack in a perfect  degree grid? Even if those stones in fact made physically identical honeycomb cracks I would be more amazed but they are imperfect hexagons so yeah... nature doesnt work in long straight lines.,EarthPorn,d1bj9dn,0,t5_2sbq3

7255651,0,t1_d22wsnu,I already answered this. I dont know how to link to it so I quote it below. gtFirst try your luck online. Be sure not to miss the registration window.gtgtIf you dont win just go early in the morning at the BLM office in Kanab and try your luck with the walkin permit. You have higher chances of getting the walkin permit but sadly the chances are against you also depends on the size of your party.gtIf you dont win ask for the non permit area. Trust me any hike there it is more than worth it. gtYou also have the North Rim Grand Canyon close by.gtGetting there it is tricky. If you approach from the north your need a WD car or something with a higher ground clearance hills mud gravel water but the drive is shorter. From the south you will drive for  minutes painfully slow... gravel a bit of mud and a road that will make you give up.. dont!!!. gtOnce you get to the parking area you need to hike for . hours to get there. But that will not happen since you will stop every minute to admire the scenery. There is no trail just some occasional marks. I missed them and got a bit lost but I am not sorry.gtBe sure to be there early in the morning carry with you a lot of water. It will get HOT!

7833947,0,t1_d3wlhjd,You are right they do contradict each other but thats because you have to see a slide with your own eyes to understand it What you see in the picture is a high contrast scene due to the scanner being unable to pick up all the hues and color accurately but if you looked at the slide itself it is much less contrasty it magically preserves the color saturation but since our eyes are so good only the physical eye can see its magic As for the exposure latitude im not sure myself why it is strict I think its about the printing on film process.,EarthPorn,d3wlqku,2,t5_2sbq3

7836888,0,t1_d3wqtxb,Look at it this way. I lost my canon D on this trip to the good old ocean. It cost me . Now if i want to replace it i will have to upgrade it again in  years. However my Pentax cost me about  on ebay with the lens  rolls of velvia  cost me . Processing csot me about  including shipping. The amount of film i shoot is far less than how many i shoot on digital. I can shoot and process a whole lot of film and get a bonus which is the slide itself. I did buy an expensive scanner Braun FS which i used to scan this slide and it cost me  its a lot of money agreed but that is all i have to invest into for a long time now. So i would say it turns out to be about the same.From a photography perspective i prefer film as it slows me down. My film compositions are way better than the digital ones i took plus in later years if the scanning technology gets better silverfast is doing a great job for that i can scan the film again and get a better quality photo that is what i love with film.Another alternative is shoot mm slide you can find a very good film camera mm for super cheap one bay like . Then you can buy a slide projector for super cheap and be amazed when seeing your slide on the wall. To me its also about the experience ,EarthPorn,d3wxme5,1,t5_2sbq3

7938576,0,t1_d48cdyu,Kind of.  The  Mormon War was where they were they were beaten and thrown out of their homes for not having the same religion as pretty much everyone else.  They moved to Illinois where they established a compromise that as long as no more Mormons moved there it was okay.  But Mormons were getting beaten out of other places  quite literally!  so more Mormons showed up to where their churchs founder lived and settled a county or two over.That broke that compromise and they were again beaten up and sent out of town their founder and his brother were killed by mobs in the s and their main temple was torched while any Mormons living off on their own... yeah that didnt work out well for them either.  So they were stuck in a town and prior to things like modern grocery stores being cut off from farming wasnt great.They planned an exodus and picked a spot in northern Mexico that no one wanted.  In the meanwhile another war made that no longer Mexico but part of the US.  So they moved there anyways no other large enough group wanted Utah so they finally found a spot that was safe for their religion.I think their religion is a bit strange but its just more modern than the larger religions not actively weirder.  That said everyone else beatingburningpursuing them out of their homes three or four times?  That definitely was a strong part of what shaped them into a durable religion much as Moses exodus is part of what shaped all of the Abrahamistic religions.And you can certainly buy a beer a lotta places in SLC so its a lot like most other places these days.,EarthPorn,d48dd0v,35,t5_2sbq3

7968635,0,t1_d4bpf1z,Basically yes but if you want more infogtOver  million years ago a single mass of granite punched through Earths crust and intruded into the heart of the Namib Desert in what is now northern Namibia. Today Brandberg Massif towers over the arid desert below. The locals call it Duresthe burning mountain. The granite core of this nowdormant volcano is a remnant of a long period of tumultuous volcanic and geologic activity on Earth during which the southern supercontinent of Gondwana was splitting apart. The mountain influences the local climate drawing more rain to its flanks than the desert below receives. The rain filters into the mountains deep crevices and slowly seeps out through springs. Unique plant and animal communities thrive in its highaltitude environment and prehistoric cave paintings decorate walls hidden in the steep cliffs gouged in the mountain. This  Landsat  image also captured an older and moreeroded granite intrusion in the southwest.

8263569,0,t1_d5a8lmf,I visited in January . Very windy and cold but beautiful in its own way. As it was raining I slowly made my way up the trail but remember a few girls hurrying ahead of me up the path. As I got closer I saw a large sign saying if you want to talk to someone call this number and listed some number. This was right at the entrance to the actual cliffs. A little worrisome... I ended up seeing the girls running back down again but they had a look of horror on their faces. A few moments later a few people in uniform from the info center at the base of hill came up and asked if I had seen anyone jumping. Apparently this happens a lot well enough to warrant a sign. I felt so bad for anyone considering that last resort as well as those girls who most likely saw the end of someones life.,EarthPorn,d5ai560,4,t5_2sbq3

It takes time to learn how all those settings work. But I definitely recommend you dive right in! When you modify a RAW photo in Lightroom you can undo your modifications at any time.

We were in the dining room together and tried to communicate but we didnt know German and they didnt know English. After dinner we all retired to the combination pub and great room. They kept to themselves as did my wife and I. I dont know what I had for dinner but Im sure there was some red cabbage in there somewhere. All of a sudden I was overcome with an extraordinary amount of gas. One of those farts that just jumps out. And it was also very loud! Time stopped. You could here a pin drop. I thought I was really in trouble and then the Germans broke up laughing. I settled down for a while and then one of them let loose with what sounded like a trumpet! Well I was reloaded by then and answered him. The rest of the evening was spent sparring. What fun! The next morning the Germans had checked out and we headed down the mountain to zermatt. In the middle of town we saw I swear to god! Aleksandr solzanitsin! I was going to go speak to him when the champion German farter ran up and laid one right upside my head.

8972455,0,t1_d7qc4jo,We flew to Barcelona and rented a car on the airport. The first to days we were in Barcelona and on various beaches at the Costa Brava with one wonderful beach which picture is still in our heads the beach Sa Tuna. Then we drove in direction to the Aigestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici national park in some small village called Espot. There we hiked for two days and the last day we drove to the backside of this national park for a hike and on the evening we drove to Torla a small village in the Ordesa national park. It was a astonishing atmosphere there and the day after we went on a hike in this valley you see in the picture above. We hiked for two or three hours to the Gradas de Soaso waterfalls which were a unique but wonderful. Due to bad weather we needed to abort the hike and drove approximately six hours to Cadaques in the middle of the Cap de Creus peninsula. There we enjoyed two days at the beach and on the last day of our vacation we luckily booked a hotel on the south of Barcelona which was located in the small town Vilafranca del Peneds. Which was the vine capital of Catalonia therefore a wonderful ending of our trip. I hope my little description gave you a picture of our trip.,EarthPorn,d7qcq9b,1,t5_2sbq3

I drove by it on my way into Page and it looked like the sky was on fire with the clouds around sunset.  Its a little less than a mile hike to the canyon so all the light would have changed before getting there. Get there an hour before sunset.  Use a sturdy tripod because youll be set up next to a  ft cliff and you dont want your stuff to blow overknocked over.  Youll definitely want to bracket your exposure. Bring an extra layer it might get cold.  Also bring some bug spray.  I got bit a bunch.  I also brought a bottle of wine and some snacks.  After I took these pics I went around to the right side away from the crowds and just enjoyed being there while the sky turned colors.  If you do that make sure to bring a headlamp as well.  You definitely dont want to accidentally fall into one of the crevices. ,EarthPorn,d8p1egt,2,t5_2sbq3

9490689,0,t1_d9iqt0r,Karst is most definitely not limited to China though this is a very beautiful example of it. Australia has some of the most advanced karst topography in the world in the Blue Mountains many eastern European countries are built atop karst topography and extract their well water from karst caves and places such as Florida are in the beginning stages of karst topography. In millions of years Florida will look like this. karst topography is formed through the dissolution of limestone by water percolating through the system. This hollows out caves which continue to grow in size eventually undermining the stability of the material above causing the above material to collapse into once was a cave. These are the remnants of the regions that were not undermined.,EarthPorn,d9ixi2g,6,t5_2sbq3

You must angle your body precisely so that the water is SLICED in half reducing the direct impact that would break your bones. Thats why water diving birds have pointy beaks.

I would imagine they would need a pretty low profile boat to make it over the rocks or theyd have to swim up to the shore at which point itd probably just be easier and cheaper to rap down.

10160640,0,t1_dbvqtvi,Once you get to the western UP its much less touristy. Everything is more of a backcountry experience. Youll rarely find wellmarked trails. There are a few nice places you can get to by car but overall its not an experience for everyone. Everything I listed was decently accessible to someone with little outdoor experience. Also many of the spots in the western UP are smaller themselves. Instead of staying within  minutes of a town doing things youll be driving all over spending anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours there and driving a while to the next spot. I think an itinerary for the western UP has to be more carefully planned with respect to the group.,EarthPorn,dbvrjvg,3,t5_2sbq3

10286344,0,t3_5n9tm2,Here are some more photos from my recent Arizona trip for anyone interested. I still have plenty more to add as I get through them.EditTo answer some of you this is actually two shots brought together by layering and masking in photoshop one exposed for the foreground and one exposed for the sky. I took this shot at about  pm. I wasnt lucky enough to catch any cool light rays coming down partially due to the assigned timing of our tour and the time of year. Also I was told that the Upper canyon is much better for capturing this effect but we didnt have time to go through both. On my website you can click the little i icon in the bottom right corner when you click on a photo to check out EXIF info but keep in mind that any shot in the canyon that also has sky is a combo of two photos like this one. Why did I choose to do this? I wasnt happy with a blown out sky or too dark of a canyon and I wanted to try to best represent the canyon how I remember it with a beautiful cloudless deep blue sky above a red and orange canyon.EXIF info of the two combined shots  Canon D Mark II amp Canon EFS mm f. mm  ISO  f. mm  ISO I left the ISO high because I had to be very fast switching between exposures while standing very still due to not being allowed to use a tripod a tripod so it was easiest to quickly adjust the shutter speed and leave every other setting as I was shooting in manual.I know that a TON of people have taken and shared many pictures of this canyon but I really wanted to see it for myself and I knew it would be challenging to get compositionally good and interesting shots. Some things I tried didnt pan out too well in my opinion and others did. I dont claim to be a professional photographer by any means I just really enjoy photography and the challenge of taking photos that I like and want to share hoping that others might enjoy them as well. Thanks again for all of the compliments and Im very glad you like my photo! Cheers!,EarthPorn,dca0hy9,65,t5_2sbq3

10320948,0,t1_dcdvxj5,Just got back from a short trip there and I am also a frugal college student so couldnt afford to do a whole lot. The country is beautiful and there is a lot to do I would definitely recommend renting a car if possible. Food and alcohol is pretty expensive  for a rack of lamb  for fish of the day in Reykjavik etc. Buy alcohol at the duty free when you land if you plan on drinking. Lodging was decent was able to get a room for  a night with the person I traveled with cutting cost to  a night. If you have any questions feel free to message me.,EarthPorn,dcdxpor,62,t5_2sbq3
10321118,0,t1_dcdvxj5,Food gets very expensive but I packed some dry goods to mitigate costs. Airbnb I stayed in was quite a good price  USD.Navigation around Reykjavik was easy enough. Very walkable and the bus was decent. Outside the city having a rental car is the best bet I think. You can cover quite a bit of ground and see more than on a bus tour. Rental car was pricey but worth it. Driving was very easy there just be aware of speed cameras they are merciless. Languageabsolutely everyone I spoke to barring a two year old girl who kept trying to speak to me in Icelandic  speaks English. And they speak it well. I often thought I was speaking with an American or a brit. I was there for a week and was quite happy with the amount I was able to see just in the southwest of the country. Id say a two week tour all the way around the country would be perfect.Long story short I cannot recommend Iceland highly enough and think its a perfectly manageable destination for any experiencelevel tourist. ,EarthPorn,dcdyeoe,10,t5_2sbq3

We have nothing but  pairs of cloths a tarp some cord and we made fire busting kits out of juniper trees rocks and sage bushes. One night I was camping alone away from everyone and I built a big fire. Later a pack of coyotes was near and I called to them. That night I slept next to their pack.

Just worn down s to s buildings with bad infrastructure and flat areas as a stereotype.I can make alll the generalizations I want! Watch me Im doing it here.

10853389,0,t1_ddz59hw,The issue is they have to share the tracks with freight traffic and in Canada there are no laws granting priority to passenger trains.  What this means is you are frequently stuck behind heavy freight trains going ltkmh through the mountains and being on single track sections you spend a fair amount of time in sidings waiting to trains coming the other direction to pass.Also trains have much more severe limitations on how steep the tracks can be compared to cars so the tracks have to follow the valleys and loop around quite often in places where the highways can take shortcuts with steeper grades.,EarthPorn,ddzg7wx,2,t5_2sbq3

10939172,0,t1_de86y64,Theres nothing wrong with a composite imo especially stars and landscapes. The one I hate the most though is the super obvious large moon on a super wide shot photo and the author denies any scaling manipulation for the moon.After the Supermoon event happened late last year there was a post shared to me by a friend asking if it was legit. The shot was most likely taken with a mm or less focal length. Cityscape type of shot but with the moon the size of a small burger when I viewed it full screen on a  monitor. In the comments the author was denying any edits. Not even an mm on a crop sensor could capture the moon that big I did that and I had to crop just to make the moon the size of a coin.,EarthPorn,de8armz,1,t5_2sbq3

11002590,0,t1_dedpaib,Oregon is pretty overrepresented on subs like this due to the fact that it has a lot of its good stuff close to its population centers and are accessible with easy day hikes.But really I dont think many would claim its the most beautiful.  Mountainwise the Cascades get significantly better in Washington.  The Sierra and Rockies are also prettier than whats in Oregon IMO. Then you have Utahs Big  desert stuff too which is totally different. The only thing that Oregon really has on the other West Coast states is its coast to a certain extent.  Then again my opinion is probably overly colored by the  miles of PCT I did in Oregon which were largely mediocre outside of Crater Lake NP and Columbia Gorge.  ,EarthPorn,def40yu,1,t5_2sbq3

While visiting Banff Jasper Yoho...one day hopefully Assiniboine you cant help but be impressed and wonder if anyone could visit and not be taken by its beauty. Within these parks you will find one amazing destination after the next but of all of them that I saw I was the most impressed with Moraine Lake. Massive peaks standing tall reflecting in the distinct blue waters of the lake below. Obviously Im not the only one as tourist flock to this lake every day and the parking lot will usually be full before am. If you havent visited you should add it to the list!Shot Info Nikon D w Nikon  fISO mm f .sIf you would like to see more photos feel free to follow me on Instagram  Facebook or check out my website www.rosssvhphoto.com,EarthPorn,deskmd5,79,t5_2sbq3

Sportfishing of Taku River Salmon was closed completely for the season this year which also forced the cancellation of the salmon derbies which raise funds and provide scholarships for local youth. Im not trying to imply that the tulsequah is what forced this in any measure but it certainly isnt good for fish stock numbers. Polley was pretty bad from the gate.

Would highly recommend renting a car to go around though as taking the bus can be tricky if youre not Norwegian or well known. Next you stop by Bergen before driving down again I would plan a road trip to get the full experience much better than flying and stop by Geirangerfjord for a cruise experience through the fjords. I wouldnt bother with Oslo except for the Folk museum where they have a lot of cool Viking artifacts. Stay by the coast in the South and youll have the best experience. ,EarthPorn,dfh0pel,2,t5_2sbq3

I only ask because I am an avid outdoors man and while I respect nature to the fullest degree I feel like this long has a special place in time for us to enjoy. I would love to take my shoes of and feel the energy of the once living mammoth and stand on the surface of the water in that beautiful place.

11802586,0,t1_dgxucu9,Your previous comment was useless if you had something to sayask you should have done so and not starting downvote a moderators removal reason. As for the it has only stairs going down the second rule of our sub stated in the sidebar isgtIf you are submitting an image with man made objects present unless they are very small and barely noticeable it will be removed and referred to rruralporn or another appropriate network subreddit.Those stairs are the opposite of small and barely noticeable they take up half the shot. You could have easily avoided them by shooting out of the railing and your picture would have been  natural landscape. As it is its not suited for rEarthPorn Im sorry. Read carefully our sidebar rules and take a look at the FAQs too before posting please.,EarthPorn,dgxv49h,0,t5_2sbq3

11803804,0,t1_dgxrnka,Its kind of hidden away. But you park up at the top on the road on this turnoff then start hiking down and you keep going down until on your left theres a sign that says something along the lines of Wildlife and flowers stay off path basically. And then you turn and actually go down the path it tells you not to go down. So lots of people miss it because there is this sign telling you not to go down there.,EarthPorn,dgy035f,0,t5_2sbq3

11806549,0,t1_dgy64gr,You have a lot of forests like this here in Belgium. This one is the most famous one the hallerbos.They wont bloom anymore but go and walk around in nearby nature domains the older the better e.g. around castles if you see those plants with long green leaves remember the place and come back when the bluebells bloom they all bloom roughly at the same time.Look for forests with beeches. ,EarthPorn,dgyba2e,5,t5_2sbq3

11810555,0,t1_dgxpgmf,Re the traffic problems. Ive lived in Houston most of my life and went to school in Austin  Im tempted to say psh amateurs but I wonder how the traffic situation really compares. Regardless I suspect people from those cities and some others would see Portland congestion as a godsend. Even if thats true your huge growth rate will probably equalize things soon. Flying cars when?,EarthPorn,dgyrn0y,1,t5_2sbq3
