I wasnt dreaming at all read I wasnt remembering them when I took an interest in LDing. The first thing I did was write down some dreams that I DID remember. They were from years ago but I still wrote them. As I was writing them a hell of a lot more started seeping in. If you cannot remember ANY dreams at all from your entire life then my suggestion might be to write down a dream you would like to have.

66343,0,t3_1utemd,Hey I am the OP of CrazyInsanes technique. I would suggest setting your alarms a little earlier. Like if youre going to sleep at  pm set it for  am. Thatll give you  hours which is a solid number for me. Then when your alarm wakes you up. Dont be startled dont try to turn it off dont open your eyes and dont change your position. The instant you move youve shafted the whole attempt and will have to start from scratch. Also I dont know if I would set the alarms so close to each other. For one if it DOES work for you theyll probably wake you up in the middle of a good LD which would suck. If it DOESNT work you might be too awake next time if the alarms are only  minutes apart. Just dont get discouraged. Patience is key and dont be anxious. Anxiety may cause problems as well. Keep it up and I hope you have success!Happy Dreaming!,LucidDreaming,celzec8,3,t5_2r0f4

252598,0,t1_cf6x39m,Thanks bud! Im glad to hear my efforts arent wasted!gtWhen you add a new piece of memory to your walkthrough but you are not actually sure about the chronology or the relation with another memory or if its part of the same dream at allWhen starting out it is very common to have your memories jump everywhere and the dreamssettings will be a chaotic mess. Your dreams will change locations and situations rapidly and for no apparent reason and wont always fit the walkthrough setting.This is incredibly common until you begin active control of lucid dreams and disciplining your mind to keep coherent transitions between scenes and maintain plot structure. However its not that the memory has to fit in the setting but the setting itself is a jump off point where by doing the walkthrough you put yourself in the same state of mind as when you were dreaming which leads to memory connections.If you arent sure where it stands hold that piece and continue with the walkthrough until more pieces come to light and you can start making sense of the chronology. Keep in mind that the endgoal here isnt to make your memories line up with your setting but instead to recall the dream itself. The setting is just a useful tool to making that happen more reliably.gtdo you wait till it all becomes clearer or rather make up some quick fix to make it coherent and remember it more easily even if youre not sure thats what really happened ?Two modes of thought here. Be stringent in your dream recall even if it makes no sense. This helps with memory and making meaningful connections.. Fill in gaps or smooth out incoherent aspects of a dream to make the story flow better. This practice is more about training the mind to be more cohesive in future dreams.Both are good and I use both regularly. Nowadays I get near instant full recall of most dreams when I wake up so it isnt as much an issue. Starting out though Id focus first on just recognizing the dream as is in all of its chaotic glory. Then after I got as much information as I could Id then go through the mental process of creating cohesion. I realized that after time doing this the dreams themselves would become innately more coherent. So I took that to mean the practice of creating cohesion helps train the mind to be cohesive while dreaming.So both. Geezy I get long winded.gtDo you put all the dreams you had during one night into the same setting i.e. the one you walked through during hypnagogia even if they are completely unrelated ?Hit this a bit above. For clarity the setting is a tool we use to create a reliable system a series of constants that allowed me to remove as many variables as possible when starting out. It let me focus on details and gave me a solid starting out point for recall that over time teaches the brain to connect dreamstate memories to conscious thought more readily.Also if your memory is completely unrelated but you have enough information to realize the new setting then use that! Do a walkthrough of the new setting and see what memories are triggered. Like I said earlier its a very fluid methodologybut you have to have the discipline to control the chaos. Boundaries are good for practicing.,LucidDreaming,cf6xpq6,3,t5_2r0f4

329217,0,t3_1xs39j,Please post the results in this thread. Good luck There are several theories of how similar techniques work. The conditioning you describes doesnt seem to work that well. I think Ive never head of a report where it worked as expected. But your alarm might still make you lucid just in a different way. The best time to use these kinds of techniques is in the morning e.g. do WBTB and when you take a midday nap.There is this method called Rhythm Napping. It basically works like this. Set an alarm to go off every few minutes starting after youve fallen asleep. The alarm doesnt have to continue forever. About  times every four minutes for example should be enough. After that you can program the alarm to go off every  or  minues These are just examples you can experiment a bit with different times. The sound should be only a few seconds long and they should be very loud. Its OK if it wakes you up every  minutes at the beginning. But they should not startle you so you can fall back asleep right away! So its better you use a short sample of music or something that starts silent and fades in to its full loudness. If there is no app that you like that does this you can just build an audio file with the sounds.The idea behind it is that you get used to being interrupted every four minutes and start to wake up on your own every four minutes. After the rhythm ends i.e. four minutes are over but this time there is no sound your brain expects to be interrupted and gets alert again but you continue sleeping which results in the sudden realization that your are dreaming. It can happen like this but it can also have other effects. You may get a very light sleep during the rhythm of alarm sounds. They can make you more attentive and thus increase your chance to notice something dreamlike like dreamsigns you are looking out for or things impossible in the real world or it can make it easier for you to remember your current state. So for example it can happen that you think Wasnt I just trying to fall asleep? How did I get here? which also makes you lucid. The third way it can work is that you hear the alarm sound within your dream and hopefully realize what it means.It can be a very effective technique for beginners. And you should read other guides and experience reports if you want to try it.,LucidDreaming,cfew7gu,1,t5_2r0f4

Isolated whey protein is designed for the body to adsorb very quickly the protein is literally digested and in your system within mins after consumption. Now when you are dreaming most of your energy is being spent fueling your consciousness while you are sleeping. The fast absorption of the isolated whey protein is so quick and readily available that your brain will use up the proteins for energy before the muscles even have time to do any repairing thus boosting and fueling your brain for maximum performance.

But it doesnt make my theory invalid in any way.I am familiar and agree with it but fail to see how it relates to any of my points.gt further exacerbating them using false memory techniques is silly. Maybe even dangerous.Absolutely!gt OP WANTS TO CREATE A FAKE MEMORY. But he thinks it will help him find the right memory he is looking for no.Thats not what I gathered. It sounds like hes interested in using his dreams as a method of accessing information he may not be able to consciously obtain. This is very plausible.gt Since lucid dreams are entirely through your imagination not using old memories stored somewhere else.Thats half true. The very fact that your dreams are a product of your experiences unless youd like to disagree with the link you posted in the beginning means its both a mixture of imagination and memory.Clearly Im not saying your dreams are a  with your memories but to imply they have no affect is preposterous I cant type that word without laughing just for the record. gt No I havent but Ive heard many stories of false memory in dreams.Absolutely as well! Im not disagreeing with that either!gt By using those false memories as an attempt to think theyre real memories is yesIsnt that obvious? But why are you automatically assuming the memories are false?gt it was the way you thought Im interpreting all of thisAlcohol dude.

To be able to do that just remember about the device while youre awake and youll remember it while youre LDing.

If you want to log brain waves your options are limited.The only big commercial EEG on the market is the Emotiv Its expensive toy version is  developer version which is  and the code is locked up tight. Also a bit of controversy about its design since it has come to light that there is only about M ohm resistance across the electrodes which aught to be much higher. Theres the neurosky which Sparkfun has for  is very affordable but only has one electrode. Problem is you cant do any mapping with just one channel. However it does supposedly measure overall levels of the various frequencies of brainwaves. Also its fairly easy to tap the signal wires of these and feed them into an Arduino.This community has managed to make an open source an EEG. A Bulgarian PCB manufacturer Olimex makes both the boards and an assembled unit for about  or just the boards which you the buy components separately for and solder them down for about   cost of components.Ive recently put together one off the Olimex boards. Havent gotten around to trying it but someone from this sub made an open source lucid dreaming EEG app which was compatible with the OpenEEG.

It will try to wake you up by tingling on different parts of your body to see if you move which is just a way the body tells itself whether you are awake or not.

It helped me! Also a few tips to lucid dream. Make sure you have a good sleep cycle going to bed and waking up at the same time every night. That will help out a lot. You can train your body to wake up right after a dream. You can do this by going to bed thirsty then taking a huge sip lay the drink down and go to sleep then you should wake up to get a sip after a dream. Or put a mental note to wake up after a dream. Waking up after dreams helped me improve my recall so much better! Then in  weeks of recall practice and not even using reality checks i had  lucid dreams!! It should work for anyone too!

Often youll feel like you are in square one until something clicks and you jump to square .Well said.  Now the problem is if you think the mind is a hard obstacle it often becomes hard because the mind loves to create selffulfilling prophecies.  Its not a rule by any means but its certainly something a mind can do which is basically to do what you expect.  And if you expect difficulties it can sometimes create them.Of course underestimating the mind is no good either.The best cleanest attitude toward mind is to have no predisposition at all.

But I always end up floating towards the sky even phasing through objects to get there but I always end up crashing back down to earth though. No sensations beyond floating though. Last time it happened though as I was falling back to earth I said Please I just want to to back home. Than I got into some minor argument with a an unknown voice and was allowed to float away from earth with some restrictions. The ending was unclimatic. I got whisked across space and found myself in a concrete alley with a dream character. He pointed to a turd on the ground and I figured that was my home. I laughed and asked him if earth existed in a piece of shit too. Nonchalantly he replies maybe. I havent meditated in a dream since than. ,LucidDreaming,cid6e7c,1,t5_2r0f4

From this you can deduce that space and time are related in some way and effects like time dilatation that are noticeable only at speeds near the speed of light. This is physics of the real world that are consistent and that you can study and expect to act always the same. This is not the case of physisc of a dream world because everything happens in your head and you cannot expect things to be consistent to be able to apply anything of physics of the real world. ,LucidDreaming,ciy8bvh,2,t5_2r0f4

1513295,0,t3_2bj9yl, Id consider myself fairly advanced at all aspects of dreams and the unconscious mind.  I may not be a Doctor but Ive dreamed with full lucidity thousands of times so maybe I can help.Ive had the same dreams you have had!  Theyre built into our memory in the same way fear of wild animals is built in.  We fear dark masses because theyre a vague representation of the danger that lurks in the unknown but once you gestured at it and it dissipated your brain moved onto the next set of processing.Night terrors are horrible but theyre not the same as sleep paralysis which is simply your body keeping you from acting out your dreams but it works both ways.How your body feels when its asleep also affects how you dream.If you sleep on your back it changes the abilities youll have in your dreams as opposed to sleeping on your left side same with your right side or if your hand is under your pillow or free.  Ever had a problem punching something in your dream or using your arms or legs?  Thats your body sensing that your limb is somehow trapped under your pillow or if youre on your side one of your legs may be under the other thus disabling its use.  I just had a series of personal family tragedies so I havent had the best dreams in the last few weeks but it didnt stop me from dreaming with lucidity but Id like to mention that it also is affected by how exhausted you are mentally and physically.  Activating lucidity takes concentration and its more like flexing a muscle than youd think.  Sometimes youre just not mentally up for it and your mind takes you into your worst fears and terrors.If you have multiple lucid dreams you can get trapped into multiple wakings which are a real pain in the ass.  Then each time your eyes pop open you think youre awake but youre not.  Its in these levels that sleep paralysis and weird dark things can happen in your room.  Keep in mind theyre harmless constructs and theyre as much a part of you as your fingers or nose.  I can usually get out of that cycle by just diving into the darkness.  If Im in bed and theres something similar happening to me almost all of the time I can realize its a dream and just sort of float out of bed into the dark mist.  Once you enter that mist your mind voids and begins a new scenario that turns into a new dream.  Dreams are all about processing information so any time you see a darkness or void or ocean or something that just plain looks like nothing thats your mind trying to find something to fill that void and its just sort of doing its best.  I love cliffs or tall buildings.  Theyre my favorite things because YOU CANT die if you jump off.  Youre Superman.  Guess why.  Its because youve never jumped off a cliff before.  Your mind has no common frame of reference so it just fills in the experience with something else.  Maybe youll end up in a totally different place.Embrace the strangeness.  Its all you.  Its all part of you and how your mind is trying to handle the stresses of the real world.  Dont be afraid of labels.  Youll know if youve had a night terror as Ive woken up screaming before.  Its not a good feeling.  Luckily Im old now and Ive learned a lot.  My dreams most of the time are now afraid of me.Good luck.tldr dont be afraid of your own darkness.  Youre in charge.  Youre Superman or the Doctor or whatever character you want.  You can float or fly or be shot with no consequence.  Its completely and totally all revolving around you.  ,LucidDreaming,cj5yv36,3,t5_2r0f4

I had little succes with FILD twice but havent retried recently.Now I have most of my LDs  during the last month using a sort of DEILDWILD. Basically when I wake up earlier in the morning naturally or with an alarm Ill start visualizing a situation I want to go in or just something that comes to my mind and I try to focus on every sensation around me the touch etc. At the beginning it is just like if Im imagining something during the day and I cant feel anything but within min if it works Im fully in a lucid dream. It is a WILD but much faster no SP and etc.I almost stopped doing RC during the day I do maybe  or  occasionally because after doing that intensively for  months I had  spontaneous DILDs but LD from other methods.gt do you have advice for other beginners?Keep a dream journal try many times every technique you hear of youll find some that suits you better.

1667285,0,t3_2dg1g2,I had a nasty series of false awakenings myself this morning coincidentally. Ill try and post my own personal technique.. Try and remain calm. False awakenings can be freaky but they arent life threatening. Remember that this is your mind and your dream and you are in control of it so theres no reason to be afraid.. Try and have some kind of focus when waking up.Ill use my iPod touch as the example because its both my reality check and what I use to record my dreams.Sometimes Ill try and wake myself up to record my dream only to realize that I only dreamed it and I was still asleep! When waking yourself up try and focus on every minute detail. Can you feel the weight of your iPod in your hand? Can you hear the sound of the buttons clicking on the screen? Do you feel the sensation of the light stinging your eyes? What about the scratches on the screen? Ask yourself questions like this and if the answer to any of them is no try again.. Try and make yourself get up and start doing things.If I stay in bed when trying to wake up I can find that I can make myself else up then fall right back to sleep and start dreaming again!Instead try and make yourself not only wake up but start moving and not just lying in bed. Focus on the sensation of opening your eyes how it feels to breathe ect. Stretch and try and get yourself sitting up. Stand up turn on the lights ect. Try and remember what things like gravity feel like and focus on those sensations.Bonus tip Try and see if you can get an alarm clock for yourself. I find that an outside influence entering my dreams is a good way for me to ease myself out of them. I personally use an alarm that sounds like church bells tolling so it isnt quite as startling as a regular alarm. You can get one for a handheld device that wont wake up your significant other.Hope I helped! ,LucidDreaming,cjpbn5p,1,t5_2r0f4

1952899,0,t1_ckofacz,Short answer Thats it! When you are good and relaxed and you are ready to be in a lucid dream know that I am lucid. You will immediately experience your perception shift into a vivd tangible dreamscape.Side Note I only had to say I remember my dreams once and it wasnt even right before bed. What is important is how I dont need to reinforce this truth right before bed. It is simply fact.I look forward to hearing about your success now that you remember your dreams like me and can be lucid on command. It will be nice to add your experience to the anecdotal evidence supporting this method.Long answer how this worksI feel this longer explanation helps to truly get the most out of this technique. You could take it on faith and that actually be more effective but that only worked once for me with FILD after  seconds I felt the transition. The second time I was unable to make the transition. However with this method it has worked every single time and for me it is due to an important underlying understanding when performing the exercise.Saying I am lucid is present tense. This does not need to be mindfully considered after stating it. It is only stated once and believed as present fact. I havent had to reinforce it even once since initially stating it to be absolutely true. You dont need to worry about anything it will actually hinder you if you do. Simply introduce the fact that you are presently lucid and experience your perception immediately change to satisfy this belief.Please consider my light switch analogy which metaphorically explains the intended usage of the phrase. It uses I remember my dreams as an example.Light Switch Analogygt The present tense exercise must be treated as a light switch. Your belief starts in the off position I do not currently remember my dreams. And even when you state I will remember my dreams tonight it is still in the off position at present. Sure it may flip on later if your subconscious remembers to make this fundamental change in your belief but you will likely fall short of your expectation. When you state I remember my dreams the switch is immediately flipped on. It will remain in the on position as long as you dont contradict this new fact with silly statements like I hope I remember my dreams tonight which would imply that your stated fact is somehow not absolutely true.If you understand something to be true then when it is applicable the belief is applied without any effort.So how do use I am lucid? Dont worry about anything lay back down relax and when you are ready to really believe it say I am lucid and immediately experience your perception shift into a dreamscape. My experience with FILD and this method were identical at the moment of transition but I found this to occur IMMEDIATELY upon stating it as presently applied fact. This has worked every time I have used it during WBTB and that is due to my absolute faith in the statement I make to transition.,LucidDreaming,ckoj0kd,2,t5_2r0f4
1965988,0,t1_ckpr9fw,The campaign tells you REM detection via algorithm combining eye tracking accelerometers? and past history.    Test data also from campaign page During testing  of the test subjects achieved lucid dreams in less than  days.    He doesnt say the test population size though.   I think having a huge experiment with hundreds of test subjects would be great but realistically with these prototype projects there arent all that many devices available so the population probably isnt all that large.   But for me an already fairly experienced LDer all I need is a tiny nudge during a dream to get lucid.

1976280,0,t3_2hbk89,Depends on what method you are trying. Keeping a dream journal is helpful when you are trying to achieve a DILD because you are supposed to be keeping track of different dream signs or concurrent themes although its worth mentioning that just having said journal wont guarantee having lucid dream after lucid dream you also have to practice mindfulness and be constantly aware of your surroundings.However if you are practicing WILDWBTB methods keeping a dream journal although helpful its not necessary.,LucidDreaming,ckrcb68,1,t5_2r0f4

2004014,0,t3_2hojon,You were in a hybrid state there some of your senses had reached the dream state and you were in sleep paralysis but you were not entirely in the dreaming world since when you tried to move you actually tried to move your waking body which were paralyzed by SP.In that moment you will feel some unusual feelings that you are not used to which can be scary at first but wonderful later on since you will know it to be a gateway into lucidity. What you need to do if you reach that state again is to relax and visualize your body spinning or like rolling counter clockwise why not clockwise? well sure do that but I prefer counter clockwise easier to replicate the feeling when its your right leg that controls the momentum and think of what it would feel like to just spin and spin dont mind that you are in a bed just think that you are floating in space without any gravitational pull.That should kickstart the dreaming process and you will most likely find yourself in some sort of dreaming scenario or experience a false awakening which is the same thing as long as you remember to do a RC and then you are free to do whatever you like.,LucidDreaming,ckuokh8,3,t5_2r0f4

2032807,0,t3_2i2b5c,For most people lucid dreaming is hard work.  It takes time energy determination and dedication.   Results are usually not instant so it also requires a significant amount of patience.   It takes consistent regular day work and night work.  If you keep at it you will get lucid.    Think of it as a journey rather than as a destination and your mind will get more into the right place.One RC per hour is probably too little time spent thinking about dreaming during the day.   Generally better than just RCs is cultivating a permanent mindfulness of yourself where are you what are you doing who are you with what is your mental state whats going on around you?   Realize that at any conscious moment you could actually be dreaming once you start recalling enough dreams youll fully feel the truth of this.   Note I do not recommend ADA as typically practiced it places too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of attention to your self.    Simple summary try to stay tuned in all the time rather than being zoned out.   Cultivating mindfulness is its own reward in waking life as well.Try to build more dream recall to the point where youre regularly remembering multiple scenes every night dream recall is one of the foundations of LDing you can never have enough recall!   You can set intention to notice the little wakings during the night and recalling your dreams at those times youll start building up longer and longer recall soon.,LucidDreaming,cky7q9c,2,t5_2r0f4

2121104,0,t3_2j6zut,Posted a quick description on this topic before but here we go again with more of the storyI had this happen a lot after my father died and some times even now  and a half year later. Its feels easier for me to come to the conclusion that I amLDing when I am meeing loved ones.The feeling a couple of weeks after his death when I had a dreem where we where together and I could say goodbye is one of the best experiences of my life. And Im starting to cry again...We where on a long walk in the mountains with several people but me and my dad walked together. I have to note that he loved walking in the mountains going for long trips with some friends often walking from cabin to cabin. I never got to go on any of these trips with him but I have been on so many while I was little. Camping and learning to live of nature.The dream lasted a while without me knowing anything was amiss.When we got to the top of the mountain I remembered that he had passed away and I knew it was a dream. I was crushed and I didnt want it to end but he told me I had to be strong and we should continue the journey. We walked down the mountain together in silance just enjoying the scenery together. That is a memory I will will charish for ever though it technicaly wasnt real. A real walk with my dad again one last time. When we where coming to the end of the path he sat down on a bushrock and told me he couldnt go on but I should continue on without him. I sat down beside him and gave him a big hug him hugging back and I told him I loved him. I walked down the mountain without my father once again.This somehow gave me closure because I only got to stay with him for hours before he died of cancer mostly because it was so aggressive and we didnt know it was that far along. In real life I got to hug him but never got to say I loved him because it didnt feel manly enough and I hated myself for it and still do. Even when I was at the hospital with him I tried to convince myself that I should just say it out loud to him but I only did while saying godbye right after he had passed.Well I got to tell it to him in a dream and it felt as real as anything because I was there and so was he. I woke up crying and with a head splitting headache and I cried in the arms of my girlfriend now wife for what must have been over an hour. Just like Im crying and sobbing just writing this out.Hope you got something from reading my experiance.,LucidDreaming,cl9fspq,5,t5_2r0f4

2506237,0,t1_cmloer6,I am a natural lucid dreamer.  Just found this subreddit a few days ago following the Joseph GordonLevitt AMA.  I hadnt realized that there was a name for it or that people actually tried to do it.  I knew about sleep paralysis and hypnogogia from doing my own research on wtf was happening to me.  I grew up believing my house was very very haunted.  I thought the hypnogogic hallucinations and SP demons were ghosts.  I thought as a child that everyone dreamed vividly and with sleeping control over their dream lives.  Found out as a teenager that very few people do.  The earliest lucid dream I remember is taking a bath with Jesus seriously! No laughing! and suddenly wanting to be warmer.  Suddenly there were taps on the wall but I wanted out so I willed them to be buttons pressed one and suddenly Jesus and I were sliding down a rainbow slide out a trapdoor in the tub down into a pit of lava that was like sitting in a hot tub.  I was seven.  I liked the dream so the next night i decided to dream about the rainbow slide again.  Then every night for a while I would try and find a way for my dream world to transition into the rainbow slide by creating some kind of way to open a trapdoor make a ladder or find a door that led to it.Edit Im  now.

Therefore you should expect to be lucid in all of the hotel ones. So practise awareness think about noticing this. Then when lucid you have to learn how to control the whole dream. It is YOUR DREAM. And you have to go crazy like flying creating planets etc you have to do stuff in your dream that is fun but puts strain on the brain things that when us normal lucid dreamers do them we wake up from excitement. I think you should see if this helps!Also have you tried sleeping in your dream?,LucidDreaming,cq9o98r,3,t5_2r0f4

3767676,0,t3_33jukc,I would say that if you can naturally control your dream its probably more along the lines of you just having a greater sense of awareness than most people.Considering most of the lucid dreamers Ive seen dont do it naturally though or at least not regularly I wouldnt be surprised if there was a correlation. Think about it If youre not naturally good at lucid dreaming it often takes a big lifestyle adjustment to make it work. Keeping dream journals doing constant reality checks getting up in the middle of the night for WBTB sitting through sleep paralysis being willing to wait for sleep paralysis to even start.... its takes a certain amount of determination.People who put in this kind of effort to lucid dream I would guess probably have some unsatisfaction with their actual life that leads them to be willing to go through things like this in order to have that chance at an alternate life. Depression can make people feel this way so I could see how someone whod do all this would have a tendency towards it. I am one of the people who put in so much to lucid dream so I wonder if that includes me too.,LucidDreaming,cqlqr80,1,t5_2r0f4

Ofcourse you wont notice a single thing but usually if you dont focus enought can lucids drop down to a regular dream and thats something you really cant notice. Its just pretty much about practice how to stay in lucid state.

3954365,0,t3_35n06i,I believe there are pros and cons to cannabis for lucid dreaming. At one point in my lucid dreaming career i started lucid dreaming every night sometimes multiple lucid dreams per night when I would take a similiar dose of cannabis at about the same time in the day. I did a few other things while high like meditate and some energy work. Also I was high on cannabis one of the only times that I CONSCIOUSLY transitioned from falling asleep into a lucid dream this was a unique experience unlike anything else. I highly recommend daily meditationI suggest experimenting and use and not use whatever works for you. Overall and for most peoplecircumstances I believe chronic cannabis usage is detrimental to physical mental emotional and spiritual health different for people with chronic diseasepain.,LucidDreaming,cr714xj,1,t5_2r0f4

The sort of energy you are talking about has nothing to do with the energy which comes out of the electrical outlet. The the unqualified term energy is measured in Jules and commonly described as the ability of a system to perform work e.g. heat an object change velocity of particlesobjects or break molecular bonds.Find another term say aura focus mental energy motivation feelings willpower etc.I dont know what fits what youre describing just pick something other than the unqualified term energy.

3986561,0,t1_crai6ai,I was pissed at myself a few days ago because I started to experience SP which doesnt happen too often to me Ive only had a handful of LDs in my life and I panicked. You know when they say dont think of something and you instantly think it? As soon as I felt like I was falling and heard the rush in my ears and stuff I told myself Now dont think of anything scary and instantly heard a scary laugh echo in my head. This escalated rather quickly and within seconds I had to shake myself hard out of the SP. On the plus side I was very close to an LD. I saw myself walking in a desert and then some guys face started morphing and jumping at me. Thats when I panicked and woke myself. I held the fear down for a bit and watched the guys face but in my panic I chose to wake up instead of face it. I was pissed. For the next time whenever that is Ive created a space in my imagination that has absolutely nothing scary in it. My imagination tends to take what is there and twist it into scary stuff just to mess with me so Ive made a place where hopefully nothing will get scary.Thanks for your reply!,LucidDreaming,crapc1a,3,t5_2r0f4

4083751,0,t1_crlonwh,Whats amazing to me is that there are people who keep up that frequency rate and even higher every night.   I tend to run hot and cold.   Im hoping my experience with changed sleep conditions will make this hot streak permanent.My story roughly in chronological order Read LaBerge ETWOLD followed his program in A course in Lucid Dreaming to a T including prospective memory exercises. started on this forum but soon found DreamViews and thats my main hangout.  Per LaBerge set intention every night to notice wakings and recall dreams recorded dreams to the voice recorder app on my phone.  Transcribe voice recorder notes to full detailed DJ entries almost every day.  Enrolled in the DreamViews DILD class and updated my workbook there every day. Started doing SSILD and MILD during the wakings at night. Battled insomnia during nightwakings where I did SSILDMILD had to teach myself how to relax and fall asleep during the middle of the night after doing these techniques.   I still have insomnia at times but my backtosleep successes are much more common than in the beginning when Id wake up after  hours of sleep and never fall back to sleep again. Spent hours every day for months pouring over the threads on DreamViews tutorials etc.   Especially MILD WILD class and LD Fundamentals QampA Made friends on DV and picked the brains of the experienced LDers there. Tried out different approaches I learned about on DV to find what works best for me. Participated in DV competitions these provided my densest periods of LDing in the beginning. Moved towards mindfulness critical evaluation moments as day work.   As many as I can manage.     Read The Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep  This book is huge.   I think you have to practice about  months seriously before youre ready to read this book and appreciate it properly. After  recalled and journaled dreams Id get from  dreamsnight more if Im recalling on every waking I realized that at any conscious moment I could be dreaming. Sitting meditation still dont do this regularly.   But I think its a huge benefit if you can do it regularly.I summarized in my initial response what is really important.    Eventually you learn that techniques are just a way to framefocus the fundamentals.  The fundamentals are selfawareness amp memory dream recall intentexpectation stressavoidance exercisebrain healthrest and nightworktiming.  And the most important metafundamentals persistence diligence drive positive attitude.  Never ever quit or even take serious vacations from practice.   The most Ill do is back off a bit from day work and night wakings at times but I always think about LDing during the day and always reach for dream memories every single time I find myself awake whether healthy sick etc.   I never ever take vacations from dream recall.Build selfawareness build dream recall and experiment diligently to find the timingconditionstechniques that lead to lucidity for you.   Youll know when you hit the perfect storm when you get a hot streak.Building selfawareness and dream recall takes time.   Its also a neverending process.  Be patient stay positive and do not quit.    Ive been at LD practice for  months now working diligently just about every single day and absolutely every single night at least on dream recall.   I had about  LDs by my first year anniversary now Im around   months into my nd year.In the beginning the standard approaches MILD WILD DEILD WBTB give you a framework to begin your discovery.  But ultimately LDing practice is a neverending journey of continual selfdiscovery regarding sleep dreaming and awarenessconsciousness.Hope that helps!    You cant go wrong starting with and following accurately and diligently! LaBerges ETWOLD.   ,LucidDreaming,crlruhh,3,t5_2r0f4

In my experience going to sleep after an experience with sleep paralysis messed up my ability to sleep for a week or so afterwards. I didnt feel tired at all. I just kinda stayed up for  days forced myself to get a few hours the third day then repeat for about a week. But wiggling my toes and holding my breath to force me to get out the paralysis had no effect on my sleep at all. I didnt think much of this until I read your post.

5002947,0,t3_3jfq9u,It sounds like you could benefit from reading a more detailed WILD guide since you appear to have no knowledge of hypnogogia and sleep paralysis which arent neccesary to know about to perform the technique but can help you understand the process. WILD is a fine technique to try as long as you understand what youre doing eg hypnogogia transition stabilisation etc but Id limit trying it to once or twice per week. Certainly only set one alarm on the nights that you try it. I know its exciting and youll want to try it as soon as possible as much as possible but doing it too much is counterproductive.With that being said you were super close and on that basis you sound like a natural. WILD may be just the technique for you. I would however recommend keeping a dream journal and performing reality checks to help turn yourself into a multifaceted lucid dreamer as opposed to a WILD specialist which can be constricting. ,LucidDreaming,cup1jx9,1,t5_2r0f4

All my daily lds are from wildsp etc. But since I dont reallyquestion myself that often that why.  Lately only RC is my watchhandslight switches  add in a few random extra rcsfor the heck of it.  As for actual in dream dilds my watch andlight switches seem very effective but they are not as frequentthough. As for being consistent with RCs for me its like everyother day or every day or if I remember I dont really thinktoo much about it.You may want to meditate more in your life every day or soat least  minutes if you want to attain it. This does help.I usually do it before bed when Im bored. This does help keepyour random thoughtsactions to keep in checked. You may seeinteresting results after you relaxed your body then to bed.

Im just curious as to why for the first  years of my life I never experienced SP or at least cant remember it then I would get it once here and once there and coincidentally ran into it on Wikipedia after the first few times so I understood what was happening to me and then it just seemed to get more and more frequent.  I just want to know why is it because Ive learned to recognize the feeling and pull myself into it?  I dont know however I do know that taking bong rips when I wake up during the night helps prevent it but its not always practical because you know life and weed makes it hard for me to get going in the mornings great when I have nothing to do and dont want to suffer through that state.

6108153,0,t3_3z5k0s,The loud rushing sound is something many people have reported during meditative experiences as well as other altered states. It sounds like you had an almostOBE. The panic is normal. I think that inside theres a part of you that associates that kind of dissociation where the mind and perception separate from the body with death. I think thats why theres this odd hesitation when one is about to enter that kind of state. Basically you have to overcome the anxiety about leaving in order to pursue an OBE experience further. Part of that in my experience can involve confronting your own feelings about death and the unknown. You cant let yourself be afraid of the experience or of what you might experience during it. ,LucidDreaming,cyjxnkm,2,t5_2r0f4

The thing that really frightened me enough to want to leave was that I was imagining what was possible next and naturally I thought of my greatest unspoken fears. Something so scary and primordial and I knew that it could exist there  its actually why I wanted to leave before I could want to go to that dark place it was a very tempting intrusive thought. I knew that the moment I realized my hands were in two different place that this was a virtual world.I mentioned this in another thread but I was also able to transition between waking space and virtual space seamlessly  it was like the frame of reference was moving for me instead of me moving from one point in space to another.

TBH I waked up after realising I was dreaming each time but just the fact that I got lucid counts.

6891063,0,t3_4a3qe2,Ive had this experience numerous times in dreams of all stripes. The most striking are in the flash dreams that wedge themselves in sideways to naps or in those fleeting interstitial instances at the precipice of falling asleep that have this fully familiar and worn feeling to them but are wholly fabricated at least so says retrospection in the moment. To my eye this elucidates a fascinating aspect of the nature of memory and as you expressed recalls the same quirk that results in Deja vu. A new memory feels old or familiar perhaps because it has become encoded in the long term system immediately instead of buffering in short term first. Thats what it feels like to me though I could be  wrong of course ,LucidDreaming,d0xf4ch,4,t5_2r0f4

6977843,0,t1_d178whh,Its varied a lot for me. The first one didnt last long because I got a little creeped out and slapped myself to wake up. The ones that I was comfortable with lasted a while. For example I became lucid in a restaurant went outside tried to fly around a little turned into some kind of skiing that I cant explain broke into someones house all while occasionally teleporting to a house party I guess. And that all took what felt like quite a while. From my perspective the ones like that have felt like they lasted a long time having done all those things before waking up. They wont last as long when youre first starting out it seems. days definitely isnt a lot it took me quite a while. The way I do it is by looking at my hands in my dream. If you want to try that method just keep thinking about it throughout the day. Look at your hands and mentally ask myself Am I dreaming? and eventually when you see something strange in your dream youll think to do it then. It only takes persistence to train your mind.

7079898,0,t3_4chy3t,Most people in this sub will brush off your experience as being a coincidence which it may very well be but will not at all be willing to accept alternative answers because science apparently already has them all. Like uEskapp said this is something that you may have to consider experimenting with yourself. There are scientific studies on precognitive dreams out there. I recommend taking a look at Skeptiko and browsing by the parapsychology section and youll find quite a few convincing podcasts that offer varying perspectives on the subject matter. Also Im not saying to completely rule out ordinary explanations because there is a greater chance that it was simply coincidence. You were also trying to actively think about him the night before so that by itself increases the chance of it being a coincidence tenfold. Even anecdotally I would have to say this wouldnt be particularly strong evidence for a precognitive dream. This also sounds more like a regular dream than a lucid one. You may find better luck in rDreams where people will be more willing to interpret your experience. Good luck! ,LucidDreaming,d1ivdkk,5,t5_2r0f4

I.e. what would I look like from someone standing  feet behind me. I was never able to fly just by thinking Rise or Fly but when I willed myself to fly and pictured myself doing so you could even say from a thirdperson perspective it worked.A similar idea worked for teleportationenvironment change. I see those as essentially the same thing. Instead of simply willing myself to teleport I instead picture where I am picture where I want to be and visualize myself jumping between the two locations. The key at least from what I found is to do all three of those at the same time. Took a while at first to be able to visualize all of this at once make sure to detail the scenes as much as possible too! but after a while it gets easier.For super speed I dont think of it as super speed. Instead I think of the rest of the world as slowing down. Even though you dont see yourself moving super fast you are moving super fast relative to everyone else.My biggest issue right now is spawning people perfectly.

7540848,0,t3_4ikn50,One of my earliest LDs that actually lasted a while began with me trying to incubate a lucid dream.  It didnt work.  Instead I found myself in the middle of NOWHERE standing on a gravel road surrounded by trees the road went as far as I could see in either direction.  I almost immediately became lucid and did my reality check  pushing my finger through my palm.  I didnt even have to do it when I put my finger to my palm it looked ridiculous and I started laughing.  I decided I needed to leave and get to... well somewhere.  Anywhere.  So I quickly thought what is the best way to leave.  A car?  I had never conjured anything and there wasnt any corner for me to walk around to assist conjuring  didnt cross my mind to do it behind my back.  Flying?  I had never done that and didnt know how to begin.  So I decided Id run as fast as I could and I started hoofing it down the road.  I thought Ill run superhumanly fast!  I kept speeding up and speeding up I got to a point that felt as fast as I could run in real life but I kept pushing.  My legs started moving insanely fast and I got that feeling like when you run too fast in real life and you feel like youre about to fall forward  except I didnt  I lifted right off the ground and flew up into the air!  This scared the crap out of me.  I flew so high that for a second I actually thought I was going to leave the atmosphere and wouldnt be able to breathe lol!  I started to freak out because I wasnt able to control it and started to fly back at the ground.  I crash landed kicking up dust in the middle of a ghost town in the desert with a few old rundown buildings.  The kind of place that looked like someone was about to have a showdown at high noon I just didnt know it was going to be me.  I just looked around in amazement thinking about everything that had just happened.  Then a windowless van slowly creeped by.  I just KNEW that whoever was in that van had bad plans for me.  The van stopped about  feet past me the back doors slung open and two guys opened fire with automatic rifles out the back.  I dove for cover and pulled a pistol out of nowhere to return fire.  A huge gunfight ensued people popping out of the woodwork to crack a shot off at me.  I eliminated a lot of them.  My gun jammed and I decided I needed something new so I managed to run around a corner and conjure my car on the other side I popped the trunk and grabbed a shotgun out and started firing again.Soon the dream faded and I found myself in a room still somewhat lucid with a friend from real life.  I was complaining that nothing went like it was supposed to in the dream and I had to come better prepared next time.  We walked into a back room that was lined with shelves with weapons and devices.  I picked out a revolver complaining that my semiauto had jammed a big knife and something else that I dont remember and I told him Id always take these into my future lucid dreams.  I didnt.  But I always found this dream very interesting and memorable.,LucidDreaming,d2zcwhb,2,t5_2r0f4

Plus if you solely rely on the dreams where your at work to become lucid your limiting yourself on all the other opportunities your dreams give you to become lucid. Your whole day should be one big reality check not when your just at work. One that works for me and many of my friends is doing a RC whenever I notice something Weird or abnormal in the waking state. When I notice something strange I say out loud if Im alone this is a dream when with company I just say this mentally. Then I convince myself Im awake by backtracking my day. do I remember waking up this morning? Why am I here? What was a doing a few minutes ago? By now Im usually lucid day and night but I like to couple RCs to confirm whether or not Im dreaming.

7746948,0,t3_4lcdsp,Ive only had  lucid dream and one thing you described was exactly how my dreams would end the dream fades into white  idk i thought that was cool how its what I went through  any way  I noticed that the harder I tried to control the dream the faster it would fade into white so for example k was testing flying and the more I flew around my dream started to fade what I did to keep my self dreaming was kinda to use my power over the dream in moderation. I slowed down how much I was trying to control and let my dream lead me until I knew I was able to take control without accidentally waking up  . I stopped flying and just went along with the dream and in a few moments altered it to my liking ,LucidDreaming,d3mrsbr,2,t5_2r0f4

In your case you are just really overaware. I recommend meditation also you should eat a banana drink some milk get your melatonin and tryptophan before sleep it will all get you relaxed and sleepy.You also might want to try WILD since having SP and being aware of yourself falling asleep are really good basics to WILD.,LucidDreaming,d3nrjgh,1,t5_2r0f4

7833939,0,t1_d3wgdsh,Dream recall can be really frustrating. Here are my suggestions Upon waking let yourself just kind of relax and drift. This can be hard when you have workmorning obligations.  When I dont recall my dreams immediately I frequently have this less potent and foggy dream residue. This can be a feeling an image a thought just a hunch that my dream isnt totally gone and I can recall it if Im gentle with it. In these cases I think of this metaphor Ive got my dream by its tail but if I force it or get flustered I end up breaking the tail off in my hand and the rest of the dream this tail was connected too is just gone. It feels a lot like fishing. So just relax let your mind wander a little bit and then hopefully your dream will just wash over you again and you can recall it.,LucidDreaming,d3wlpf2,2,t5_2r0f4

8174866,0,t3_4r9mlc,Contrary to popular belief and hollywood movies there are no fixed rules for anything in lucid dreams or regular dreams.Dream characters will behave the way you expect them to either consciously or subconsiously. So there are no definitive answers to your questions but Ill try to answer them as best as I can based on my experiences. Thats a philosophical question. Characters in my dreams disobey me regularly but I dont think they have a will of their own. Keep in mind that dreams exist only in your head  so if youre talking to someone in a dream youre basically talking to your own brainsubconsiousyourself. Maybe the human brain has the capacity to simulate something resembling free will in a dream but how do you tell the difference between a puppet controlled by your subconscious thoughts and expectations and a real conscious being? Everything will be based on your expectations. I dont think anyone can tell you how how you will visualize anything in your dream.  Some people have complete control over their dream world others dont. There are some tricks and techniques you can use to make controlling your dream easier but in the end it all depends on you. From my own experience summoning certain persons in my dreams was not that difficult but maybe thats just me. Well John didnt create a new character  your brain did. Also John doesnt really exist  hes just a figment of your imagination simulated by your brain which is also you. So basically John his girlfriend and the door she knocks on are all part of you.

Ive been doing this since I first figured out how to induce a lucid dream. Immediately after thinking this command in my LD I get a short period of humming crackling sounds and a rushing feeling like Im moving extremely fast and then Im out.Once youre out of body control becomes much more difficult especially for novices. The same principal applies  you command and your subconscious obeys. Some good commands are show me what my body in this dimension looks like or fly. Thats been my experience anyway.

Become lucid and to be Aware that youre dreaming means youre lucid dreaming yes that is a more or less universally recognized litmus test in the LD community.  It doesnt matter that youre dreaming of having a dream of lucid dreaming.    Dreaming about lucid dreaming is an entirely different thing!  OP started off with I had a dream where I became lucid.  Become lucid means to be aware that you are dreaming.  OP then writes I wasnt aware of what I was doing and that I was in a LD.  This is a somewhat contradictory statement to the first.    If youll read my original response carefully smarty youll see the first word I wrote is If.You cannot sensically write I was aware that I was dreaming but I was not aware that I was dreaming.   Control BTW is entirely separate form lucidity.   Lucidity can be low but I was aware that I was dreaming means the dream was lucid.You can have dreams about lucid dreaming without them being lucid.   How?

Your conscious mind has Im assuming read and heard many things about this being possible and knows that it is but you yourself have yet to personally experience this first hand which makes such an experience hard to fully imagine and comprehend. It is also hard to rationally explain lucid dreams as they dont really fit our general preconceived definition of reality and conscious experience. But the fact that you are performing reality checks in dreams and immersing and familiarizing yourself in these ideas is an excellent start. Just keep with it and eventually you will have the real thing first hand. And it will blow your mind. I ASSURE you  that it is very possible just have faith dont get discouraged keep practicing and reading up on it and it will eventually inevitably happen.

As you remain passive and relaxed your body begins to fall asleep and most people begin to hallucinate hypnagogic imagery which can then develop into a dream. It sounds to me youre failing to keep a conscious awareness which is why you fall asleep. It can take a lot of practice and patience so dont be discouraged!

At that time there was a gathering of some of the greatest Buddhist mystics ever known who devised the most sophisticated thechniques of Dream Yoga which have never been surpassed. It was in this extraordinary atmosphere that The Tibetan Book of the Dead was conceived and written.The dream yogis created a highly developed experientially based science of lucid dreaming which our own scientific age is only beginning to recognize as being far in advance of anything we know today.He goes into more details in a later chapter and also covers your questions or rather explains the major competing theories about what happens in the brain in great detail during sleep and dream.,LucidDreaming,d70ney2,1,t5_2r0f4

8812346,0,t3_50uey4,Youre off to a good start.   Maintain interest and desire in remembering your dreams.  The more important it is to you the better and more consistent results youll have.   Work at it every single night.   The best way to build good recall fast is to never take any breaks from trying to recall your dreams.    Make it a firm habit to reach for dream memories immediately upon realizing youve woken up preferably before moving an inch. At bedtime take a few minutes repeating and setting the intention that I remember my dreams.  Another great way to really kickstart a lot of recall is I notice every waking remain still and recall my dream.   We have a handful of REM periods every night and dream throughout each one.  HOURS of dreams every night!   The bar is so high to try to remember it all but to even approach reaching it is so awesome new amazing memories of weird fun funny sexy freaky etc. adventures that you have every night!    What a waste not to remember any of it!   Of course the additional step of writing your dreams in a dream journal shows your subconscious that dream memories are important to you and reaching for those memories again and again as you write them in your DJ strengthens the ability to recall dreams even better in the future.Heres a post I like a lot if I may say so myself with detailed dream recall hints ,LucidDreaming,d774hff,3,t5_2r0f4

9291960,0,t3_57olw8,Twitching your eyes while falling asleep helps you focus on something maintaining your awareness as the rest of your body transitions into a sleep state effectively putting you into sleep paralysis. Weird shit can happen when you intentionally transition into a state like sleep paralysis. My experience is that this is largely due to fear and where our focus is. In sleep paralysis and other altered states you can focus on senses and intend to get data that we interpret as physical sensations. My interpretation You were intentionally closing your eyes indicating you did not want any visual data. Usually our default senses after vision are body sensations and hearing. You made the abrupt and unexpected transition to SP. This made you unintentionally feel the crazy body sensation of being pulled which was exacerbated by fear. Likewise with hearing the sounds. In SP and other altered states like LD if your able to keep a cool demeanor which is tough when the first thing you feel is the sensation of being pulled into another dimension! you can experiment with your senses using focused intent. Just focus on hearing and youll hear crazy random sounds. Focus on your hearing with the intent to hear music and you can hear dope jams. Focus on your hearing while being fueled by fear and you can hear demons screaming in your face. Hope that makes some sense ,LucidDreaming,d8ttmd6,1,t5_2r0f4

About a year after his death I decided to go on a  day meditation retreat in Chiang Mai Thailand. We were instructed to mindfully take note of our thoughts by mentally saying thinking whenever a thought appeared. On one particular day I found myself thinking a lot about my dear friend so later that night I found myself dreaming about him. Since I was aware of when I was thinking about him during the day that awareness carried over into my dreams and triggered lucidity. I recognized that he had died and that the only reason that I was able to see him was because I was dreaming. It was only then that I was truly able to let go say goodbye and have some closure.

9739865,0,t3_5eludq,I just replied on a similar post I didnt feel the burning desire to retype basically the same thing so imma copypaste Lucidity is synonymous with your cognitive functioning aka your rational intellect. Lucidity comes on a spectrum from basically zero complete dream state to what you currently view as  normal waking life. Towards the zero end you are just reacting based on your core being and automatic reactions whereas on the other side of the scale you have control of your cognitive rational mind. Generally people feel like they are not themselves when they are aware at the lower end of the lucidity scale. Often people feel this way because they dont feel as in control and do things they wouldnt normally do. However in a very real sense the way you act and decisions you make in a lower lucid state is much more revealing of your true self than the way you act in waking life. This is because you dont have as much cognitive rational thinking to override how you are at a core level. People often notice when they make a direct willful transition into a lucid dream state they will have a higher degree of lucidity than when they randomly become aware they are within a dream while dreaming. This makes sense because you are coming into the lucid dream state at opposite ends of the spectrum. For Increasing lucidity aka aware cognitive rational capabilities all you have to do is hold that intent clearly in your mind i would like to increase my current lucidity to maximum And hold it long enough to have the desired effect. When you have enough practice you can do it in just a few moments. The problem is remembering to do it when you enter in a low lucidity state which is difficult with your rational cognition offline. This is why you have to make this part of the automatic routine. You just have to reinforce it into a reflex by reminding yourself to do it over and over again until the thought to do it becomes automatic. ,LucidDreaming,dadng7i,2,t5_2r0f4

9766042,0,t1_dagujv7,It depends on the type of meditation. And Ill admit there are some forms of meditation that are nearly indistinguishable from the day cleanse. But here are some quick reasons why I listed the day cleanse as opposed to meditation.  There are varying forms of meditation with a variety of purposes. For the intention of only clearing stress it didnt sound fair to only pick one type in exclusion of others people may have benefited from more because many types of meditation can clear stress by default. So it was simpler to focus on the day cleanse.  Some meditations can come with side effects. This doesnt get the attention it deserves because its just not as popular to share but yes some meditations can cause side effects. Since Im not well read on the subject I didnt feel comfortable making an entire post recommending it if I wasnt able to adequately instruct how to moderate the practice to avoid side effects.  The day cleanse works on a biologically proven way to relax the body. When were hypedanxious our breathing quickens. When were relaxed it slows down. By controlling your breathing to a slower pace it will force your body to relax at least a little. Granted if youre very stressed the results might not seem immediately apparent but it will make a positive impact on your body even if a slight one.  Connotation. I learned about this when I read more on hypnosis. Its a valid recognized form of therapy by both the United States and Great Britain. However most people get their facts on hypnosis from its entertainment form not its clinical one. There are many misconceptions about the practice which is why more people arent using it or are sometimes afraid of it the misconception that hypnosis is mind control for example. Its similar to meditation. It can carry the connotation of being too spiritual. Some even find the idea of it boring altogether. However the day cleanse carries no such reputation. I hoped that answered all your questions. If anything wasnt clear let me know and Ill get back to you ,LucidDreaming,dagvqzb,1,t5_2r0f4

The important daily steps is repeat practice and not giving up or becoming fustrated as it can be very difficult in the early learning stages when results are not rapidly achieved.Naturally occurring ones are wonderful but they can be very sporadic so learning to invoke  a lucid dream increases your success rate and techniques are wonderful for giving a very ridgid and structured focus state.The best thing to do is always go to bed with the intent to lucid dream and do presleep preparation and postsleep dream recall.

9980254,0,t1_db8fsrc,No reality checks. Ive never really been a fan of reality checks to begin with anyway. I used them when I first started lucid dreaming but after that I just got bored of doing them all the time and preferred to just use techniques. Now I dont do either. As for ADA meditation sort of covers the same principle in itself.In fact the only time I ever do reality checks now is occasionally inside a lucid dream I want to double check to be  sure Im dreaming in case I want to do something thatd be dangerous in the real world.Definitely try meditating on consecutive nights and also upping the duration. As I said to someone else on this post  the first  minutes of meditation tend to involve you still sort of being stuck in whatever you were doing previously. Your mind is still caught up in thought about the day or your previous activity and so it doesnt really settle down fully until youve been meditating for  minutes already.This means with say  minutes of meditation in a best case scenario maybe  minutes of that time youre actually relaxed enough to be meditating properly. At worst you might not get relaxed enough for the entire  minutes and might get nothing out of it.With say  minutes of meditation even if it takes you a full  minutes to really get into it you then have another  minutes of full deep meditation. So the impact is significantly greater.Given the choice Id still tell everyone that  minutes of meditation is better than none but personally Id never meditate for less than  minutes any more as the difference is quite big. I prefer  minute sessions although some days I simply dont have time.,LucidDreaming,db8gelq,2,t5_2r0f4

10219122,0,t3_5mb6q2,I couldnt follow the first part of your post but I have the same problem.  Im a physicist IRL and cannot fly in my dreams.  I have never had a dream lucid or otherwise where I fly.  Naturally that was one of the first things I wanted to try.  I tried jumping on the bed over and over to launch myself by jumping higher and higher and hit my head on the ceiling.  I have tried defenestrating.  Nothing worked.  I did have one small success.  Although I have never had a dream where I fly I very frequently have dreams where I seem to jump and hover at the apex just a little longer than I should.  And so I go around showing people that I can sort of hover.  The sensation of hovering is familiar.  So one time when I caught a lucid dream I hovered out of bed also my only out of body experience which was a trip I moved to the window it was latched and I had to unlatch it which I remember thinking was just the most annoying hinderance.  And then I went around the house I was in at the time on the side of a steep hill and launched straight out.  It didnt last very long but thats the closest Ive got.I do feel the limitation is from having the real world drilled into your head when you take a lot of physics.  But in the case I got it to work sort of I think the thing I had to keep telling myself wasnt that it was possiblebecause I knew it wasnt but that it didnt matter.  It was fine I couldnt get hurt I had control it was a dream It didnt matter.,LucidDreaming,dc2e8eu,3,t5_2r0f4

Not just because youre not remembering but also because high dream recall is a sign both of a very close connection with your dreams and a sign that you actively pay attention to all life experiences.Consistency is extremely important.   If you maintain as a nonstop goal having long vivid nonlucid dreams regularly every night is absolutely achievable if youre consistent and its important to you and you reach for dream recall as the first thing you do every single time you find yourself awake lucidity will come more and more often if it remains an important goal for you.

10600075,0,t3_5rp1lu,I am going to recommend something called prospective memory. The alarm suggestions that other people have do work...but not as well. The desire to test reality needs to come from within not from an external source like an alarm.First of all analyse your dreams for dream signposts. There might be a common object or theme that frequently appears. If there isnt thats fine pick an object that you see fairly frequently I chose my wristwatch.Now set up a prospective memory trigger whenever I see my watch I will test reality. It will take a few days to instill it but whenever you check the time let the memory and the desire to do a reality check arise. This action will carry through into your dream and hopefully sooner or later you will check your watch and decide to test reality in your dream.A more important concept as well is HOW you test reality. It cannot be a lackadaisical action. You HAVE to mean it. Consider that you are already in a dream and actively prove that you are not. Consider what would be different if this was a dream. ,LucidDreaming,dd9behu,1,t5_2r0f4

I know a lot of people just view their dreams  Im almost always an active force within a dream. My ability to detect a dream is dependent on how not real a dream is.Last night I dreamt about a trip Im taking to Florida in a few months and seeing a friend. I somehow translocated the dream to Heathrow airport in London... and was trying to decide if I could even drive a car on the wrong side of the road while at a car rental place surrounded by palm trees. That was odd and a lot of times something inconsistent like that would alert me to a dream. My friend doesnt live in England. I didnt figure it out but I probably should have.Awareness is what you need to lucid dream. Whether its through reality checks or just a general fact checking... its hard to say.

10917864,0,t1_de5xy83,So when you are writingtyping out your dreams you are doing two things. First you are stressing to the subconscious that remembering dreams is important to you. Second you are stressing to the subconscious that putting logical ordered thoughts to your dream is equally as important as remembering them.Memories in our head are a jumbled mess of pictures and thoughts and generally dont contain order. By putting them down on paper this forces us to organize and collect our thoughts and spell them out in a logical order. Think about when you had to write an essay in school. You may know everything you need to about the subject to write about it but when you sit down to write it it still takes you time to put order and structure to your paper. This takes critical and logical thought which is a quality of the consciousness.So my stressing our mind over these two qualities our subconscious will work to make it easier for us. This is true to all things about us  we change due to stress signals to make our lives easier. Think about someone who lifts weights they are stressing their muscles which signals the body to repair and grow them so future activity is easier. The same goes with studying we stress our body to recall facts and equations so our body improves our memory for easier recall to reduce our stress.So what our goal here is to stress the subconscious to both remember dreams and to provide some form of logical ordered thought to them. The subconscious then in turn will wake up our consciousness when it recognizes the dream state because that is the best solution for our goal  by providing the part of our mind that deals with critical and logical thought the consciousness!This is why it is important to not only keep a dream journal but to also attempt to put logical and ordered thought to it such as writing it like a story with reasons for events.It is also important why we want to catch ourselves day dreaming throughout the day because this helps teach the subconscious how to recognize the dream state we want to be woken up for.,LucidDreaming,de63ms6,6,t5_2r0f4

I usually have recurring tropes in my dreams but sometimes they tend to be bit unique. But then again we recall only a small fraction most of the time so its hard to be certain. No. Im pretty sure yes having a cluttered mind makes you less present and lucid dreams are reinforced with the ability to be aware and in the present. But thats my opinion.One thing I know can help you for sure is meditation    minutes a day where you try to relax and not think about anything this standard and popular way of meditating is simultaneously incredibly easy yet hard thing taht you can do but helps in this manner. Our brains want to be occupied roaming around thinking about things that dont even matter or make sense a lot just for the sake of it. Meditation besides other benefits helps you aid that.

11429912,0,t3_635g30,Dont despair one month is about the average time for someone following a solid DILD approach like what Laberge discusses in ETWOLD chapters  to get their first LD.   WILD is indeed very tricky and requires a honed awareness and deep familiarity with your own process of sleeping and dreaming.  I recommend you study closely these portions of ETWOLD.   You can follow along in this excellent companion to ETWOLD where all the exercises are laid out in a stepbystep format download it while you can and put it into your archives.Lucid dreaming is a discipline where progress is measured in months and years.     Wanting it too much and feeling frustration and anxiety can actually hurt dreaming as your subconscious is getting all these negative associations with dreaming.Focus on building dream recall in the beginning and daytime awareness.   You can try out MILD.    I do recommend learning to notice the wakings in between sleep cycles and recalling dreams.  Thats different from WBTB after you recall dreams and write down at least some summary notes to help you remember in the morning just go back to sleep after setting quick intention to get lucid in dreams.,LucidDreaming,dfrkh14,2,t5_2r0f4

11650493,0,t3_663gq6,Hey this dream character that you are actually describing might seem lost but It can be yourself I mean your subscouncious giving life advicies via dreams is one of the subscouncious prefered hobbies. Apart from that you can probably summon him backIm starting in LD if you try to reach him not by searching for someone external but searching yourself llike searching inside a honey pot for honey. Try to ask questions about yourself in your dream and if someone replies then try to  materialize him into a human body might work might not.PD I also had a dream with my subcounscious some months ago she was beautiful and charming we started chatting and gave me some advices and encouraged me to pass trough shitty times. I havent found her twice in a dream  but im trying tothats why Im starting LDing but I might encounter her .,LucidDreaming,dgglio9,1,t5_2r0f4
11652178,0,t3_666m7b,Meditation and All day awareness techniques are great in my opinion. Not JUST for lucid dreaming although theyve both helped me with it but for your everyday life. The both give you the illusion of time slowing down because you start noticing stuff you wouldnt have before. Thats why i think it helps lucid dreaming. you are becoming more aware aware of yourself. You have no idea how much autopilot we use in a day. When I first started trying out all day awareness i felt incredibly overwhelmed by it. Im not great at meditating though because laying still and focusing on my breath makes me anxious or at least it used to. The best tip I could give you if you experience something similar is to use guided meditations. youll find loads on youtube. At first it will sound really weird but focusing on their voice is much much easier and will help you get the hang of it. Also youll know when its over without having to check your watch which helps me relax and forget about time. As much as meditation is good for your LDs i would say you should practice more ADA. that gave me the more obvious results.,LucidDreaming,dggsek8,1,t5_2r0f4
11697758,0,t1_dglx551,Im sorry I disagree on every point but I dont feel it is a good use of my time to refute everything youve said Im much more interested in actual study than argument. I will say thisThere is so much that we dont know about dreams and the human mind in general. Even if we verify the default hypothesis there are so many more questions to ask and Id like to get to the point where we can ask those too. Youre taking the role of proclaiming we already know everything so theres no need to investigate further which is not helpful in scientific pursuit. Im not sure why you feel the desire to discourage others from participating in this inquiry but its hard enough to gather information as it is so I would appreciate it if you could either provide constructive criticism suggest how to improve my methods maybe or simply let others respond if they want to.,LucidDreaming,dglyjp3,1,t5_2r0f4

11722457,0,t1_dgopuuy,Thank you for this very elaborative plan of how you would do this stuff amazing analytic and a few aspects were also included in our plan. There are several steps going on here the operationalizing of variables of the different induction techniques will be the most complicated since this is a highly subjective process even if we have the EEG. At the end of our approach we will be able to identify some key aspects of a whole bunch of lucid dream induction technique doesnt matter of which kind but I do not think that we can specify one technique as the best because there are too many things going on interindividual. What we are primary interested in is the pooled and the interindividual neuronal signature of successful lucid dream induction. This can be the result from the use one to the use of several lucid dream induction techniques. Once we have enough significant data we will try to evoke the neuronal pattern with an adaptive stimulation approach including neurofeedback. There are many more things that we have included in our agenda like retesting hypotheses of foregoing studies and results but if this project wont be funded well that would be bad D,LucidDreaming,dgorr77,3,t5_2r0f4
11733089,0,t3_67701f,On average? About enough time to finish realising that Im dreaming. Instantly basically. Though lately theyve been going longer last one lasted about  minutes which is more than my total combined. ,LucidDreaming,dgpz4ul,1,t5_2r0f4

11754221,0,t3_67ljmf,Its possible youre misremembering the dream or filling in the details afterthefact.  You maybe saw a clock in the dream woke up saw what time it really was and then your mind filled in the details of what time you saw in the dream a minute ago.,LucidDreaming,dgsdcj3,1,t5_2r0f4
