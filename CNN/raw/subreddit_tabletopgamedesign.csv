My last project which was a Pirate game was almost there. I have a board made player sheets tokens as well but then the combat wasnt done well so I spent a month redesigning how to make it work which would have involved a redesign of the player sheet. The mechanics dont have to work amazingly at first but they have to at least work and it got to the point that it was giving me a headache. I hope to come back to it later this year and finish the prototype at least. ,tabletopgamedesign,ceoio2l,1,t5_2szh7

198419,0,t1_cf0xlmg,I think two hours is still too long for what Power Grid is. I really like the mechanics in Power Grid for the most part but at the end of the day there are plenty of good games with as much or more depth that finish in ninety minutes or less especially if you throw in the caveat that everyone knows how to play.

294241,0,t3_1xh17v,It may be that Im just a blah player at the game but it seems much too deterministic with someones influence over the game limited mostly to messing with their neighbors ability to go out.A commonlyused house rule Ive seen allows pushing or stacking of Draw  cardsfor example if someone plays a Draw Two on you you can instead of being stuck with two extra cards play a Draw Two of your own which compels the next player after you to either draw four cards cumulative or to play a Draw Two themselves for    etc. The same applies to Draw Fours played for cumulative draws of   etc. though its rarer to have two players in sequence to have Draw Fours to play.This improves the strategic depth slightly but Im still left feeling like the game needs something more.Heres my suggestions. A card called Play Two. When this card is played everyones allowed to play two cards per turn provided the second card can follow the first same color or same number. The Play Two card immediately ends when someone plays a Draw Two or a Draw Four. There would be four Play Two cards in the deck one for each color.. A card called Draw One. When this card is played everyone other than the player who played it immediately has to draw one card but play proceeds to the next player in order as usual. the Draw One doesnt also behave as a Skip All. There would be a Draw One for each color in the deck.. A card called Color Ban. There would be one Color Ban card of each color in the deck. When a Color Ban card is played No one may play any card of that color until it comes around to that players turn again. A Color Ban can be overturned by another Color Ban card being played. Color Bans dont stop Wilds or Draw Fours from being played. ,tabletopgamedesign,cfb9htf,1,t5_2szh7

882790,0,t1_ch4bjtr,Actually it has been depressing. I want to make a game and it definitely isnt about making money it is more about creating something people would actually enjoy. Ive read a significant number of blog posts by the guy who did viticulture a bunch of threads from rboardgames  as well as gt of these share your design progress threads ... the amount of work it appears that it would take to make a game isnt surprising the amount of work to get it published and in the hands of many is what is shocking to me. The depressing part was when I realized how much work it would take to scale back an idea to keep the game under a certain price point.Before that research I had drafted two games that I thought were heavily thematic. By chance I had found a kickstarter that seems to already have my core mechanic from one of my ideas and an existing game that implemented overall idea from my other idea... both of them executed better and were far more creative than my ideas and the one already released doesnt look like it did very well.So Ive reskinned my idea and am slowly coming up with mechanics for the new themes. I think I sat in front of my collection of  games thinking of how to smash them all together. I originally had set limitations on my self based on games that I like... and I told myself no card games. However after looking at the costs of putting together a game I have to reconsider card games... perhaps starting with a card game that has very low personal goals and then eventually escalating into my bigger ideas.,tabletopgamedesign,ch4mk6o,2,t5_2szh7

991000,0,t1_chgxhzd,Ive been watching game design contest videos where a person comes in with a prototype game and pitches it to a panel of industry insiders. Their questions are both grueling and cogent. I thought Id post an example of a Q amp A session if me and my game were put before such a panel. All typed on phone so please forgive my numerous typing errors. Autocorrect is a cruel mistress today. What is the theme and basic explanation of your game?Valor is a cooperative dungeon crawl card game for one to three players. Players take the role of fantasy heroes trying to save the realm from a cabal of soul stealing necromancers intent on summoning a demon lord of the dead. Players custom design their characters each time they play and can choose different routes to reach their goal the cursed castle of the necromancers with each route presenting different types of challenges that suit different character builds. The players must not dillydally because the Necromancers powers grow every turn and eventually they will summon the Demon Lord himself. There are a lot of RPG style fantasy card games out there. What distinguishes yours from the rest of the pack?First of all most RPGs either shoe horn a character into a certain role by giving them a unique deck of powers such as Sentinels of the Multiverse or they have most aptitudes preassigned such as Dungeons and Dragons. This game allows a character to draw from common decks of powers giving complete customization but still having a basic class structure in place to define a specialization or type of favored gameplay. A wizard can learn to disarm traps or a rogue can cast spells. Obviously a rogue will be better at the former and a wizard at the latter but that serves the game both mechanically and thematically.Also not only are there monsters to fight there are also traps to thwart and even doors that must be bypassed. Doors bar progress and waste precious time and energy. You could just hammer them down but thats noisy and attracts monsters. Traps work like monsters but like doors are hard to confront directly and often call for a more measured approach something hard to do when its trying to kill you! I feel these encounters give the game a pacing that other games underutilize.Finally player elimination has almost been eliminated. Most games of his style simply kill players that lose a combat. This game allows players to continue play but they are wounded and once again precious time is lost. Defeat is not an idle setback but not necessarily a game ending one. Why  players?Quite frankly because I wanted a player versus deck game that I could enjoy by myself. I dont have many gamer friends so I designed it around a small group. Theoretically it could be expanded to accommodate more players but right now its being balanced for three or less. What kind of player would be attracted to this game?I wanted a fantasy dungeon crawl that didnt have  pages of rules. I think someone who wants a streamlined RPG experience would like this game. It simplifies player attributes to just three ability scores and bases everything on a simple d mechanic. It makes for easy math since a  is a  greater chance of success and all opposed rolls are A B or C vs A B or C. Obviously someone with lots of RPG experience would fare better in this game but I like to think of it as a gateway game to more complex RPGs. Either that or a mentally less challenging RPG for grognards who want to clean their palette with a less meticulous gameplay experience. Are there any thematic elements that are potentially offensive?There are evil sorcerers stealing souls raising the dead and destroying cities in their quest to summon a demon. Admittedly thats fairly dark thematically. However these are the bad guys that the heroes are trying to stop. Their actions are in no way glorified. Also such activities take place off stage for the most part and dont appear mechanically. Players abilities fall into standard fantasy fare archery melee spells for attack and defense. Their powers arent especially gruesome. All in all the game shouldnt be disturbing for a young teen audience or older especially for those familiar with fantasy violence. Is there loot?Not in the traditional sense. Characters draw from decks of abilities and upgrades so in a sense loot is conflated with leveling up. Magical items would be redundant within the system as is. For example traditionally a magical sword might give a  to attacks made with it. Since characters can get ability upgrades a boost to Strength would give a  to melee attacks and damage and soak rolls and Strength based skills rolls etc. At that point why have to track items that only give situational bonuses? Even if a power gives a situational bonus to a certain roll why have a second deck of items that mechanically do the same thing? Can loot be lost broken traded or sold? To answer that wed need even more rules. Loot was cut as part of the streamlining process. Many traditional RPG players may not be happy with that. Im sorry if thats the case. Quite frankly there is enough going on already without having to devise a loot system. Leveling up is mechanically a loot system. Maybe they can be content with that. What kind of components are used in the game?Each player receives a character card that details starting stats and class abilities for whatever class theyve chosen. It also has a list on the back of the card of actions that are available to all players.There are three color coded decks of player abilities and power ups one for each ability Strength Cunning and Insight. These are drawn from communally when experience points are granted. There are also color coded tokens used to track each characters stats. Certain cards will grant a permanent boost of a stat of the commiserate color thus awarding another token.There are six small location decks about  cards each. Players can choose what path they take to the castle and each path is represented by a deck of locations that must be traversed. One deck is for locations within the castle itself.There are also six encounter decks with each one corresponding to a certain path. Encounters scale as the players progress and are location appropriate.There are also Shadow counters. These show the progress of the summoning rituals. Every turn increases this value as does player defeats. Slaying Necromancers and freeing captives reduces this value. Certain enemies are empowered by this value and if the value reaches a critical step the Demon Lord is summoned and all hell breaks loose!Resolution dice color coded ds round out the set.If youve endured to the end I applaud you! Any feedback is welcome. ,tabletopgamedesign,chgxmsv,1,t5_2szh7

1024275,0,t3_25tqcz,I just understood a part I did not get about the original stated rules color ! suit in English. In Swedish the suits are called colors so I was thinking How could there be a second match? Must be a second deck for the middle card... Color meaning blackred makes more sense.Now to the parts that still confuse or worries me if I should try to play this What questions are legal to ask? Since with just This question must be either a yesno question or a question that can be answered with a number. Are you the killer? would be a legal question though I feel this is not the idea... Granted that would mean the next player up would know the answer if the answer was yes. So asking Are you either the killer or have the four of clubs? Answer yesno would give me too much info since I could be holding the four of clubs but the other players dont know that. Feels to be against the spirit of the game.In either case a player can only be asked any given question once. What decides if a question is identical to another question? How many red cards were you dealt? refuses to answer and puts down a  of spades Next turn How many red cards plus five of spades were you dealt?.Yes Im rules lawyering to the point of being the hated in most game groups right now but Id rather the rules address this instead of having someone be that guy when they try to play. Perhaps having a stricter set of questions that are legal to start with?If the only way for the killer to win is for someone to accuse wrong the killer really only wins if someone messes up? Should the detectives possibly have a turn limit or something before they have to guess? Also I could lose this game as a good guy by having misdirected my opponents too good so they falsly accuse me? Wasnt that what I was supposed to be doing since they win before me if they get too good intel? I feel like Im either missing something or it would be a feel bad moment to lose for no fault of my own because another player messed up. If Im not missing anything I would suggest having an accusation be done hidden and not end the game but with accusations only being revealed at the end and the first player who accused correctly wins or the killer wins if no one got it right within X turns. With each player including the killer only getting to accuse once of course.Are players supposed to keep all the answers and questions illegal to reask in memory or are they allowed pen and paper to make private notes? Without notes how would you know if a player accidentally remembered an answer wrong or if another player hopefully accidentally gave an incorrect answer?If I misunderstood everything and suggested fixes were none are needed feel free to ignore my ramblings.,tabletopgamedesign,chkpt2c,5,t5_2szh7

Lets say you start with  actions. Want more? Choose a part that a gives you that option and when you need extra juice tap it. The trick is that every part gives attackdefense bonuses outside of the special ability and when the card is tapped you get the special ability but loose the other bonuses for the turn.I would love to see a card drafting mechanic before the game proper. this way even the notsogood cards would see some play.I think you need dice rolls.

The Disease Goes Airborne event pictured on this page has a typo referring to a card called Gas Mas which I am assuming should be Gas Mask.Pg. If the player purchased a card with a Homestead symbol in the upper left corner he should play it faceup next to their Homestead card.If youre going to use a gendered singular pronoun he you should continue to use it throughout the sentence faceup next to his Homestead card.Also the cards pictured state Place on your Homestead.

The cubes begin play in the exact spaces shown in the photo but are placed in a random order. Each turn a player moves one cube of her choice.The rules of cube movement areCubes move in orthogonal directions a cube may turn a corner of the ring on which it started its move or it may turn upon reaching the edge of the board.Each cube moves a number of spaces equal to the number of letters in its name Red  Blue  Green  Yellow .A cube must always move exactly the specified number of spaces it cannot stop short cannot jump over another cube and cannot end its movement on top of another cube.For a player to win she must move a cube directly onto the center square a cube may still pass over the center square.It might be in this rough draft of the rules that the game drags on for too long or becomes a stalemate too often due to opponents constantly blocking each others moves if this is the case it might be necessary to add a scoring system based on passing a cube over the center square.

Several people on here gave amazing feedback regarding the event cards and I am happy to say we added almost all of the brainstorming ideas that were mentioned!We are now waiting on our official prototype that we ordered on The Game Crafter last week. Here are some of the problems we have run into while ordering the prototype . Component Sizes. A lot of places like the Game Crafter do not have custom sizing for components so you have to make do with what they offer. This leads to..... Sizing all of the art on the different components. This was a bigger task and pain then we ever thought it would be. We now have two different sized prototypes One that is completely made with what The Game Crafter offers and the other is a mix of what TGC offers and custom made components we made personally. . The price. We obviously tried to keep the price as low as possible so we could potentially send some copies to play testers and reviewers. The total cost for our prototype? ... which includes shipping and tax. I think we may just ship one prototype to several people and simply ask them to ship it back to us when they are done with it. We certainly dont have a couple hundred dollars laying around after paying for amazing art. . Font. We found amazing font that fit perfectly for our theme. We wanted to put this font on all of the cards rule book etc.. The problem was the font was for noncommercial use and the ownercreator was no where to be found! We wanted to purchase the font but we were unable to do so so we had to scrap that font and found a pretty good one on fontsquirrel.com.

4681469,0,t3_3f2cy1,Either draw method is potentially able to be balanced even your original draw  then draw  end of turn.Dominion and Dominionlike games Ascension Star Realms etc. can hinge on drawing the right combination of cards.  Holding cards in your hand makes it easier to match combinations of cards together.  Magic is an interesting example because there are many gamewinning combinations of cards that can be played immediately and Dominionlike drawing would make those decks broken.  No combination of cards wins the game on the spot in Dominion.  There are certainly turns which in hindsight win the game but luck can still thwart most good turns.  So how powerful combinations of cards are is one potential dimension to consider for your game.The resource system is also an important consideration.  In Magic the presence and necessity of lands creates a lot of interesting interactions with cards.  The relative scarcity of cards also makes each single card quite valuable a resource in its own right.In Dominion a card is worth less because you will often have some nontreasure cards you cant use.  So cards like Draw  for free are fine while that would be absurdly broken in Magic.  Generally speaking each card you draw in Dominion is worth the amount of gold you expect to gain from that card.FWIW in the CCGlike game Im working on we opted for more of a Magiclike system.  In our game you start with  cards and then each turn choose to either draw one or recruit a supporter which is similar to turning the top card of your deck into a land.  Actually its more complicated because lands are also creatures in our game.  I like the planning and strategy that holding cards enables so we went with that system.

4841307,0,t3_3h4ddn,Basically using armor efficiently is hard. It might look easy but its not. You basically have to finetune all your motor skills again You dont remember doing it last time? Thats because you were a baby.You also have to build the muscle required to wear any armor. Heavy armor is heavy. It weighs down on parts of your body that you are not used to. Even light armor inhibits your movement and you need to relearn it Albeit I would argue that it would be easier since its closer to our natural state by which I mean unarmed.If you have the chance to try out hema or SCA heavy fighting. They exist in many countries and many parts of them. Once you got a full armor on you will see what I mean. And once you got it on imagine going around in it all day. If you can try that. Then argue that your DampD fighter never takes off his armor. But in the end if others get penalized or if fighters gets bonuses from them does not matter all that much. The point is that wearing and using armor IS a skill that you can get better at. Id even argue using it as a skill instead of a proficiency since you can be better or worse at using it.

I know that you cant emulate real time combat on the board but at least I want to keep some of the feel to it.Combat is meant to be tactical as players control individual squads and vehicles. Units automatically engage enemies that are in their range so player has to primary think about unit positioning. I want to keep the numerical system of tracking damage as squads have different sizes and each damage symbolizes dead or badly wounded squad member. This is important because factions involved are asymmetrical  one prefers smaller squad sizes making up for manpower shortages with training while other prefers bigger squads of inexperienced conscripts. In the first case unit rolls plenty of dice to attack per member but lose more when they receive casualties. In the second case theres less dice per member but losses lower units fighting capabilities by smaller margin than in the first case.,tabletopgamedesign,cv270bg,1,t5_2szh7

5237097,0,t1_cvh7f2g,gtI bet he would argue more for SFs original  characters vs. SSFs  playable characters.Whats the argument other than its not his taste? In his video he claims a small amount of content is good for the game but that it steeply drops off and backs it up with a fake graph with axes Quality and Content. No effort is made to back up his statement or even define quality. I would argue that his quality argument is straight out the window considering Magics broad appeal and financial success.He mentions games being harder to balance but then again I already believe that he inflates the importance of game balance.He claims that content focused games are hard to learn but again I believe he inflates it. I learned how to play Magic when I was  and Im no genius. The difficulty of learning these games is mitigated by the form of the rules change. The core of Magic is super simple each other card simply changes a small rule in the core game. Likewise you dont need to learn all the items or characters in LoL to play it and have fun with it. What this content DOES do however is give the players the ability to creatively build their decks or champions. This wouldnt be possible in a game with less content. As a player who values being able to play creatively my subjective quality graph might skew towards content.His ending strawman at the end dismisses the argument that variety doesnt matter out of hand sayinggt If you have a strong core mechanism the system itself should provide a wide variety of interesting situationsWhich may be true but the whole thing is a zerosum my idea of a game is best. When the benefits outweigh the risks which I think they often do there is room for great games to also feature lots of content. For example Heavy Euro games may have the strongest core mechanisms and be mechanically deep but may also be actually as impenetrable as he claims League of Legends to be.gtbut I think a lot of people design them because the complicated interactions make them feel their game is deep. First your disagreement with the genre is an assumption of how the designer feels? David Sirlin designed both Puzzle Strike and Yomi which both had massive amounts of content yet he claims that his love for asymmetric games which Keith doesnt enjoy and his arguments against content mirror his arguments around asymmetry is due the joy of having options and characters and variety. Second Magic the Gathering is deep especially when played on the tournament where the content really matters.gtYou have to know what you are getting into when you design that much content and you definitely shouldnt start your design out with a ton of content.Well yeah always work from the bottom up. However your entire article and Keith just told me to stop designing content because it isnt as elegant and pure. So what is it?

5390288,0,t1_cw0noqx,Blue cards are always removed from the game after they are played.  This prevents loops where things just keep getting repeated.  The played cards are left exactly as they are when you move on to the next age.  So when youre playing the rd age the th and th age will just be a shuffled deck of those age cards sitting on the mat.  The st and nd age will have the cards each player played on their respective sides of that age mat and the unplayed cards in a deck on that ages mat. As you play its possible likely that cards will move between the ages.  If I send a Vanguard Fleet from the th age back to the rd age then the rd age gets reset that card will remain in the rd age deck and someone else may get it when that age is replayed.If an age gets reset all the cards including the played cards for that age get returned to the deck its shuffled and is set up like all the ages from the beginning.  When you replay it its exactly like it was before except cards may have moved between ages and players will get new cards and will make different choices.You get the blue cards by playing a Chrono Research card as your play on any age.Blue cards temporal cards stay with the player  they arent a part of any age.  Once a player gets a temporal card its theirs until they choose to play it or someone plays a temporal disruption card these come out in the th and th age.  When a temporal disruption card is played remove all blue cards players have from the game.  If a player plays a temporal disruption card it is removed from the immediate after its effect.Thank you so much for your questions!

5538469,0,t3_3qqvsz,Make a document and outline every part of your game with clearly stated goals.  What is the goal of the game from a design perspective?  What is the goal of the turn structure?  What is the goal of the overall gameplay time?  What is the goal for the player interaction?  What is the goal of the art?By doing this you will be able to see when your vision is not be carried across and you will also see when people are merely giving you tangential advice.  Some players really cant handle the idea of prototype and dont understand that even the font is a placeholder until the game is totally ready and what matters is the gameplay.  So they will play a game and tell you about the colors instead of the turn length.  Thats fine IF you know what you are trying to doso if you set out for happy bright colors and someone in a black metal tshirt tells you the game looks annoying you know that you can file that under thanks for your input.Im only saying all of this because while the above comment are correct that you must be open to core criticism its possible that someone just has a bogus opinion or even that your game is working and therefore sparking up creative inspiration in someone else.

6090945,0,t1_cwhoa88,gt Im looking forward to seeing what you come up with. I put this game on the back burner for about  months. Came back to it during christmas break and holy shit. So Im all about AB testing. And only changing  thing at a time. Thus things get kind of tedious. And take a while.  But oh man. So first the bad. Having the players start with  random cards and having them buy stuff they need  for  from the continuity is kind of cool but doesnt work for this game. See I actually enjoyed it it was fulfilling at first to burn cards for stuff I need. But its also a bit plodding and limiting It doesnt fit the theme of the game at all. So I dropped it BUT  with the right theme and victory conditions that on its own is a really cool slow burn mechanic.You slowly build up your hand with cards you need in order to pull off big gotcha moments. Its cool but it didnt work for this theme. Here is what did work   cards representing your big bad and then  each for each of his minions everyone starts the game with  minions. And then ALL the cards in the continuity are power neutral and you can draw up to  on your turn without spending any cards from your deck. So your deck is growing incrementally. Once I get the basic ebb and flow of this ironed out I have a few ideas to add more depth to the game Example every minon has a specific victory card they must get for X Bonus points. Some of the heroes have specific kryptonite counter cards floating around. Some minions cant use certain cards some cant work with eachother and some get a bonus against certain heroes. You can get things like trophy room or jail cell to take victory cards and heroes out of your deck. The function of having a bunch of heroes in the draw deck which must be defeated before anyone can go after the victory cards is so great. As it is  You draft your team of villains and then there are  cards in the continuity and  pile of victory cards.  If at any time there are three of one card all of the action cards get swept and replaced.  Once a victory card is won all of the action cards get swept and replaced.  You can not go after a victory card if there are any heroes present.  Some heroes have game effects on them like when this heroe is revealed you must make an attack on it during your action phase or lose your turn.  Heroes are defeated the same way as victory cards but worth less victory points. At least  hero is worth no victory points and always gets recycled back into the continuity so hes just always popping up and fucking people over. ,tabletopgamedesign,cyhz6rw,1,t5_2szh7

The only problem is that its so easy just to lie that one time and eventually win the game because of it which matters so much more as the game presents itself as somewhat competetive.Perhaps the Hunters should have a way to actually chech behind the screen or make the screen obsolete at a certain point in the game or make it so that the board updates itself with enough clues that cheating eventually is obvious?I suspect I simply have to play and develop the game further!,tabletopgamedesign,cyjkq81,5,t5_2szh7

6243853,0,t1_cyyitrc,gt It has ages and  of players but not an estimated play time.Noted!gt The setup illustration game in progress illustration Img.  shows  piece piles is one a discard pile? Should the draw piles get different illustrations that look like the back of the cards. Yep waiting on art. gt The outside the grid notspaces seem weird to me are they referenced by some cards? Nope they are illustrated to show where you cant play. We may solve this by adding a board. Its being discussed.gt Off the bat it seems weird that older rules cards overrule newer rules cards. Can this make it so that a rule card you hold has no effect? This is a bad rule we have decided. It will be taken out back and set free to roam the hills. gt My group would require a piece wheel to be visible during play is there a tilestarting rule card for that or will I have to leave the rulebook open to page ? It could make a nice card back for the pieces.Our plan is to make it the card back art for this exact reason.gt Having a starting board format stack em could help too.This would go on the board we think. Leaning towards adding it.gt If I plan on playing  pieces and then play the first piece invalidly Im forced to play a rule or event card? That could suck if you reeeally didnt want to play those.This confusion comes from bad wording on our part I think. On your turn you can play a card from your hand and a Piece from your Holdings or instead of playing a Piece you can play a second card from your hand. You can also pass at any time.gt The headings in the brown boxes could use a bit more horizontal padding between the border and the text. The rulebook on the last page feels like it should be centered. The page number font is unique its kindof weird. Just noticed its also used on page  The main title is visually underwhelming.Art is coming for all of this. Thanks!gt Does anyone need to be reassured that when the board format changes the pieces in the grid that dont match the new format stay put?No ones made that mistake in our play testing yet. Ill keep an eye on it. Good thought.gt Mentally Im calling the pieces holdies or holdees because theyre stored in my holdings.

6333958,0,t3_427izq,We played.  We enjoyed it. We have feedback though.Your eight looks like a three. Its very confusing on the socks and should be easy to fix.Our two player game took from approximately  to . First things first that is too long. we werent spending that time looking up rules but drawing cards and waiting to do things. I think youll see why when you see our comments.Going through the rulebook in order. Setup is fine. nothing wrong there. Nice and clear and we had no issue. Aquiring yarn  drawing three works fine it felt good to draw three and didnt feel like too little at once or too much at one time.  However at two players we felt that a tweak was desperately needed. we found that it was a combination of card limit with no option to overdraw and discard and the small stitch pool that meant we spent large stretches doing nothing and just waiting. We added a mechanic to overdraw and discard to our sable limit. this allowed us to actually continue moving in the game rather than stalling out. without that change we would have stopped playing early and not finished. as it is our game took  hours and without this change it wouldve been . this may be a two player only issue and not nessicary at  players but again. without this we wouldve stopped playing entirely.Trading  works well we really enjoyed how this forces you to think about what you are placing out to be available and overall we think this is perfect as is. Stitching  Do you score all open sides that match colours when placing them in? we werent sure and your example doesnt indicate if it does. The wording was also slightly ambiguous to us. If you dont we feel that you should. We probably played this wrong though. this would mean that a single tile could score  points if it is matching colours on all sides. One thing we feel is that the scoring needs to move faster than it did. Again... three hours for a  player game was far too long. One thing that could fix this is adding a point value to completing any project. a flat  points maybe. not only will this speed up point accumulation but it will have effects that are valuable later. It makes for a more positive player experience overall and makes completing a dishtowel worth doing. As it is you can probably do better to just ignore your dishtowel entirely once you get another needle. Also at  stitches per player we felt like we had virtually no options. maybe just make the pool always  stitches. I cant see why that would break the game at two players and it means you always have good choices. changing this based on player count doesnt actually make much sense to me. having  out means you are seeing  tiles or about . of the availible options. increasing over time. having  means we only get . of the availible options meaning our game was much much slower and often got bogged down in having lots of one colour in the stitch pool but no cards to buy them also why we instituted the discard mechanic increasing the pool might eliminate the need for discarding but one of the two if not both need to be investigated because otherwise it is a huge bottleneck to game play. you either need lots of options or be able to dig for cards. Casting on a new project  works great. worded well and straight forward.Frogging  in its current state we couldnt fathom a situation where frogging would gain you more points then you are abandoning. If that is the case we didnt find it. If you added in the flat point gain for project completion frogging would potentially be worth it as the  would just take away the completion bonus for a net  project. you would still not score the bonus but it would push end game faster. this also allows you to make some points in this maneuver because again. how would you ever make points by frogging in the current rules. This could also we feel at least be fixed by allowing you to cast projects back on that have been frogged. ie complete project and put aside. frog project to use stitches more effectively cast frogged project back on to complete for bonuses at endgame. dont combine this nd mechanical change with the points for project completion as it opens for abuse. if you do use them together. plan the the abuse. we still think you should need needles and open space to cast them on but being able to fix it later feels good. I personally would just do the point gain and have a net  loss for frogging  gain  lose potential bonus lose   Speaking of scoring.  points was too much. at  players  felt like it would have been plenty.  might be fine if you added more ways to earn points more quickly but  hours until we hit . ok...  points for a set of  accessories is light. socks are diminishing returns high upfront but late adopters get screwed. i like it. blankets and toys are fine. sweaters are  points each which is fine because you should be some nice column bonuses when you make them. accessories are worth .. points each depending on how many you collect which means i never want to get them over a sweater or a blanket. blankets are easy to get  bonus points from.accessories are  tiles needed for a crap point distribution. if you scored each tile by itself at  depending on set size your sets would be worth  respectively and that is much more reasonable. it makes them more powerful as a large set which is how they should be those numbers arent perfect but they are much more interesting to the player to give them a goal or a reason to block the other person. As it is im always going to to socks instead as they are generally more points for less work. Base game.  before tweaking probably  with tweaks. easily higher with some tweaks but we had fun despite the length and would play again with some rules adjustment to shorten the length. Knit Happens cards. Cat attack  overall negative player experience but not game breaking. we felt it increased the game length without adding much in return but its wouldnt be the worst thing to continue having it included. distracted knitting  better in many ways that cat attack because of the placement of the removal. being in a row is less punishing even if it takes out  stitches. we both felt like this was fine but could take or leave. the wording on the cards needs to be more clear for this and many of the other cards though as the card left us with a different interpretations than the rulebook had.Knit along   didnt affect us much but we enjoyed the concept and liked the rule design. Knitting group meeting  Another perfectly enjoyable card. was met with some funny groans if we had just purchased what we wouldve benefited from before this card was found but we liked this card too. Knotted Skein  too restrictive to be useful. we never ended up using it over other cards perhaps because we were discarding even in the normal game we feel like this would still be better as a flat wild of  possible colours without the restriction of number of cards played with it.Mismatched dye lots  incredibly negative and random experience. had almost no affect on my wife as she wasnt playing blankets or toys and fucked up all the plans I had fought to enact. upon being hit with this card I considered forfeiting as the feeling of taking my perfectly made toy and ruining it was just in no way fun or enjoyable. we both agreed that we would not include this card ever again. Moth Infestation  fine. no change needed consider a better card description.Overdyed Yarn  good we both enjoyed this effect. Sale at LYS  we felt that in the early game before we choose to add the discard mechanic this card was next to useless but after that was a pleasure to use. take that how you will. Yarn Swap  fine overall no change needed. Overall we enjoyed the game. It took to long and over stayed its welcome. We had to make some decisions on the fly to fix what otherwise wouldve made us put the game down and not come back to it but we feel the core mechanic is fun. we enjoyed making garments and playing the games on our project boards. it just needed to be polished slightly more for us. Hope I helped. Looking forward to the mechanics seeing some revision and if you come to market I hope to get my hands on a copy. ,tabletopgamedesign,cz9lnym,3,t5_2szh7

6478525,0,t3_44d3b3,I cant think of anything that directly plays as you describe but my initial thought is to something like Pathfinder the card game.  You build your deck level your characters and push your luck by sometimes adventuring a bit too far when youre low on resources or are having bad die rolls.I also am reminded a bit of Quarriors where you roll your dice and dice deck build.  Now granted there isnt much press your luck mechanic in that one simply because theres only a few dice that allow you to reroll and no traps at least in my versions but with a few additional dicerule changes I feel like its somewhat similar in my eyes.gtWhat are ideas you have to mix them which youd like to see tested?Im not quite sure I understand this question.Your game sounds really interesting!

6535435,0,t1_czv6oq4,You could modify the cooldown system without making it super complicated in order to adapt to a more complicated spellmagic system.If youre using  cooldown per spell then obviously having more spells is a direct increase in power even if the spells basically are clones of one another  i.e. if you know just  spell  firebolt and its on a turn cooldown naturally learning a frostbolt spell that does the same thing also on its own seperate turn cooldown your ability to dish out damage hugely increases.If thats not what you want you might put them on a shared damage spells cooldown a spell schoolspecific evocation spells cooldown or some mix  i.e. each spell has its own cooldown counter and it also sets a schoolspecific or damage spellspecific cooldown counter too. i.e. if the firebolt spell remains at a  turns personal cooldown it might also trigger an evocation schoolwide cooldown of  turn too.Theres also the option of pushing cooldowns  that is granting the ability for a spellcaster to strain himherself in order to reduce a cooldown amp cast a spell earlier. The video game Dungeonmans uses a form of this  physical spells cost stamina points which the PC has a regenerating pool of like mana points but also have a cooldown during which time the ability can be activated with additional strain more stamina than usual.,tabletopgamedesign,czvbee2,1,t5_2szh7

And also all things like icons and other graphics I need to put on the cards I can just draw straight away inside of Inkscape with all the tools it includes for that even if sometimes more complicated shapes are better to export to bitmaps before using in the countersheetsextension luckily that is a single press of some keyboard shortcut to do though and every time they release a new version of Inkscape new cool tools are added for free that can usually be used. I think it makes sense to build on top of that rather than working on a standalone format and editor. It is painful because of issues with not being able to support all of SVG though.Other than that I have no idea what features are or are not in nanDeck. My tool does not come with its own scripting language for instance but me and others have used eg python to generate the CSV and again I think it makes more sense to just use something that already exists rather than making something new from scratch and anyone is free to use their favorite language that can output CSV or just plain text so pretty much every language ever. There are some features I am particularly happy about with how to generate doublesided components usually counters but they have been used for tiles as well and I have used them for doublesided card prototypes and shortcuts to do things like optionally include bits of templates with a y or n in the spreadsheet to choose when to include or not. Oh and running on many platforms not just Windows without emulators.,tabletopgamedesign,d030p9z,1,t5_2szh7
6639900,0,t3_46ly5d,Sure.  You get the largest area of the board with the smallest circumference.  This means it fits on more tables.  They would also have to print fewer hexagons to get the game balanced see below.Its logically easier to set up.           with each smaller row fitting in the corners of the larger row.Its visually appealing.It maximizes the number of internal vertices that is vertices that are on three hexagons.   of Settlers of Catan games let all players place all their settlements on three hexagons which  they like and  is balanced.  It is usually optimal but occasionally not optimal.  Stretching the board out into a diamond means you either need more hexagons to do this or there will be more players going on the edge of the map with two hexagons which isnt fun.It makes it easier to deal out the number chits.  This way you go in a spiral that coils inward.  In a diamond youd have to have another more complicated rule to place them in the right order every single game.  I havent calculated it but it would probably also be harder to ensure no s and s are next to one another on a diamond board.  Almost certainly I dont think it would be possible to have four numbers that cant be next to one another on any other shaped board with  tiles.,tabletopgamedesign,d064fzi,4,t5_2szh7

6958734,0,t3_4b09jv,I dont like that health and Action points are linked. It could work but I think it would be better if you did an Imperial Assault like movement and action system. Like each side gets two or three actions per character and can only perform each action once per turn unless otherwise stated. Actions could be move attack take cover interact open door place charge detonate charge flash banggrenade place special item Jager Mute Rook reinforce walls take Item diffuse etc. Teams could go Back and forth taking actions. Maybe make it so players can build out their characters with upgrade cards and make the cards worth points values to balance the game. The more armor they have and the more stuff they carry makes them slower but can take more hits or shoot further or whatever. I think there would be a need to make it so ambushes are possible maybe some sort of secret movement system for defenders where they are revealed if they are in line of sight or something. Or possibly a programed movement system like xwing with dials. I think this would be something that would be awesome if pulled off correctly. Good Luck!

7407577,0,t3_4giojj,Thanks for posting!  I read over it some Ill be honest the whole parts of the cardgame terminology part I couldnt focus on right now.  I would encourage you to remove the small details in the  orbs and consider doing away with the gradient as well.  The symbols are strong enough to stand on their own. In terms of overall graphic design you could use more constrast in general.  Light on dark is a risky move and prone to looking smudgy when printed.  I feel like the font for Rulebook for on the first page looks too similar to FINAL ROUND and I would encourage you to either make it the same font exactly or make it very different though I dont really like to see more than two fonts per page.  Have you considered using the FINAL ROUND font for your text this is assuming it has a lower case set and the FIGHT font for your headers?  It will give you a more uniform look.I also think since you have a primary design elements of the  orb colors you consider recoloring silhouettes to match these colors?ver .. should either be bumped up more or moved down farther and placed in the right corner.The first line on the section after Playtesters reads oddly.  Im reading it asFinal Round.Fight brings the action strategy.I do not know the correct way to fix this and will leave that to someone that knows that.Object of the GameConsider shortening this to Remove all the cards from your opponents deck while maintaining your own. and then add a section called Overview and put all this in there.Hope this helps.

7435465,0,t3_4h49h5,We had pdf drafts of our  double sided cards . Even with   single sided cards printed per page and what felt like painful autistic style aural reading of every card over and over again to find mistakes I kept finding mistakes. Minor typos language glitches the thes splitting a line etc. Stuff wed missed in months of development. Finally after the th draft we thought the text was perfect and sent our first prototype off to be printed. It wasnt until after those cards went out that I noticed that  of our question cards were supposed to be italicized and that had been dropped between the th and th draft. A minor mistake and those prototype copies never reached anyone else hands. I think you have to tell yourself that there will be a mistake even after printing. Thats what prototyping is for!

Hidden information is the meat of communication based games think pictionary or charades one person has the answer which is hidden from the others.  If you want the sheep dog players to have more agency then they need their own hidden information.For instance  Imagine the farmer has a hidden objective get the sheep to the south west meadow.  The dog could have its own hidden info perhaps the dog gets to see the top card or two from the random sheep movement deck you suggested in your third point because the dog is more in tune with the sheep.

Keeping the text box textures the same lends to a sense of consistency but maybe at too high a cost. Changing the textures from card to card adds to the uniqueness of each however they are already so drastically different from each other in color border style etc. that Im worried they will look like they belong to different games.Its worth noting that each card type has a unique border so only Spell cards have the filigree effect.

For comparison it took Magic about five years of expansions to get that many unique cards. And remember Magic was a phenomenon Magic has a lot of developers and those devs work fulltime on the game. Even with those advantages they still werent well balanced and had a massive number of duds in them. Youre not going to get dozens of expansions to play with. Look at other cardbased games to get more realistic limits. Magics base set had  uniques. Munchkin had  cards in the base set. Bang has  cards  of which are unique. Dominion has  uniques in the base set and perhaps  total cards. IMO limit yourself to  cards  of which can be unique. Design that set to be the best you can.

9486401,0,t3_5aoqfw,I personally wouldnt use the gamecrafter until you have a lot of playtests under your belt OR you have some conventionmeeting you need to show off your game at. In the early stages of development changes will be made. Many changes. So many changes that you might not even have the same game when you are done. The Game Crafter is excellent but a it costs money b it takes time for it to be printed and shipped. If you are making progress with just index cards and pennies keep going. Once the game has stabilized over multiple playtests there are no apparent necessary changes and players are having fun then consider sending out for a polished copy. Also art. Dont invest in art until that point as well. You might end up with art you cant use or a game you are trying to build around the illustrations you had made. For testing purposes just use Google Images for now. That being said if you can implement some simple functional graphic design you may want to do that. Especially if your playtesters are unfamiliar with rough prototypes dont invest in it just do it yourself. It helps them feel like they are playing a game rather than pushing pennies across a piece of cardboard. ,tabletopgamedesign,d9iehlu,3,t5_2szh7

If you have to make the other player win its just the same as knocking them down in health but in reverse.If its an alternative win condition you could have some kind of boardstate that players could influence perhaps secretly playing cards to a deck that decides whether the winner is the loser or not. You could implement a bettingshares system where you buy into the opponent winning enough that you gain more through their victory.You could have a system where the falsewin gives the opponent one last turn to overtake  so you have to work to get into a good position etc.Food for thought certainly! ,tabletopgamedesign,d9rxwn6,1,t5_2szh7

Theyre not working for you.Ive writtenrewritten box text to dozens of  game products. Ive never done any serious research into what works and what doesnt but common marketing principles apply. FWIW heres the rules of thumb I always start with.Text should be no longer than  words maybe less depending on the size of the box. Every time Ive written more than that Ive looked at it after publication and realized Id overwritten.First paragraph should be story Tell the story of the game Monster armies clash over ice cream factories! OR tell the story of the buyerplayer You and your friends will have a great time with this!. Stories need characters and something for those characters to overcome. This paragraph will ideally be a sentence roller coaster ride.Second paragraph should be facts about the game What kind of game it is how to play what actions you take in the game how to win. Then it should all end with a strong call to action i.e. buy this game today.Take another look at what youve got and try to reorganize it around those principles. You will need to cut out a lot of what youve already written and put some new stuff in.In a formatting sense bullet points are for powerpoints. TM!

10797673,0,t3_5uf2t3,After watching pacific rim I was super hyped on giant monsters fighting... and that required giant pools of hit points!I never got far with the game but the main idea is that I like having hit points in multiples so Imagine hit points can only be removed in multiples of  or  maybe . That limits counters or slots or whatever you count damage on. It also acts as armor and creates strategy... for example if something does  damage I only need to eliminate one point to get it to  and then only take  damage... since damage is in multiples of . Also you can have lethal attacks that round up making them more dangerous... suddenly knives claws etc are scary because  damage is rounded up to . ,tabletopgamedesign,ddtpb8f,5,t5_2szh7
10803441,0,t1_ddu4u4i,I actually really like the idea of a relatively small card game where people are building up more and more convoluted board states until somebody cracks or the whole thing tumbles... somewhere between Munchkin and playing chicken. Well if you dont tell her I will and thus begins the countdown to her finding out. ,tabletopgamedesign,dduarl7,2,t5_2szh7
10807554,0,t1_dduow30,We chose the term CCG over TCG due to the ongoing expansion nature ... But there are no boosters or randomness of the cards. Its just flat decks you can mix and match to play like munchkin. I look forward to your feedback!,tabletopgamedesign,dduq1pl,2,t5_2szh7

Hire a graphic designer whose portfolio indicates to you said designer will be able to create what you feel looks professional..

Something as small as damage on one card range on the other can turn into a huge enthralling deep system of cardplay.So often we can get bogged down looking at complex games and forget how hard it is to do something simple very well.

11251054,0,t1_df14zhb,Formatted text is great and if you get to the point where you need to layout more than just a single line of text itll be doing your dirty work. Normal text is like Notepad. Formatted text is like Microsoft Word. It does however need you to learn there lttaggt commands which make sections of text display bold or indented or as pictures. If you know any HTML its actually a lot like that. Theyre all listed or many of them? in the pdf manual that comes with cardmaker. ,tabletopgamedesign,df7agtq,1,t5_2szh7
11259362,0,t3_60ln43,You can look at Infinity the tabletop models game for inspiration.Various types of camouflage give a  or  penalty to hitdiscovery on a D but sensors called MultiSpectral Visors or BioVisors can negate some or all of that penalty depending on how advanced the sensor is.  Here are the rules for that  These sensors can also do things like see through smoke and other active LoS blocking things if the tech level is high enough.Sensors arent really whats providing better accuracy anyway.  Its the fire control system that calculates projectile drop wind effects target relative motion Coriolis effect etc.  Obviously better sensor data improves accuracy but only to a point.,tabletopgamedesign,df88cx2,2,t5_2szh7
11295532,0,t3_617a1w,A good design tip is use lowercase as normal dont use all uppercase. Your brain recognises the shapes of words as much as it does reading actual letters and when the word is all caps it loses the ascenders and descenders that form the shape making it harder to read at a glance. Another tip is hire a graphic designer. If you plan on selling the game it wont look good enough without one. If youre going to get a publisher to make it then dont worry about the graphic design theyll have an inhouse graphic designer if they are big enough or else theyll get you to hire one. ,tabletopgamedesign,dfcbyu9,3,t5_2szh7
11301078,0,t1_dfcy50v,Afraid not  not without scripting some sort of system to handle it.     Its more like a real tabletop  so if something happens to the card youll probably want some tokens to keep track of them.,tabletopgamedesign,dfcyl6n,1,t5_2szh7

11310583,0,t1_dfd9nwo,To tail on uFoundersGame s comment all games will have similar mechanics and ideas because theyre proven to work and theyre fun. It can have a number of similar pieces but if youre able to add or create at least  or  unique pieces to add to it to give the game its own unique flavor then its totally ok. If youre worried about copyright or trademark dont be. The only thing actually copyrighted for game is actually their artwork graphics and story. Mechanics are otherwise free game for published games so you have nothing to worry about there.,tabletopgamedesign,dfe1cky,1,t5_2szh7

11371506,0,t1_dfhyj53,Thats a tricky one. I think human nature makes it so if theres a possibility for everyone to win people will strive for that. Im sure as the designer you know most of the ins and outs but Ill throw out a suggestion in case its something you havent considered. Maybe you need to force players into making difficult decisions about who to leave behind. e.g. choose a player distribute ALL their food to other players. Players might develop some vendettas when you stir up the pot.But ultimately you want people to be having fun. If they are playing cooperatively and they are enjoying themselves maybe thats okay. Youll have to consider players motivations and guide them in a way that isnt forced. As designers we cant dictate what is or isnt fun.The concept is great though. Will be interested to know what ends up solving your challenge.,tabletopgamedesign,dfkxtdi,1,t5_2szh7
11478566,0,t3_63tweb,As someone who has published a game if you made a game mechanically first then take a step back and ask yourself what theme best fits these mechanics?

11509566,0,t1_dg0jyyu,the RPS is for randomizing damage. The worst thing Ive experienced in game is having to hit targets or damage targets an failing to do one effectively wasting a turn. to circumvent that this system works asThrow RPS Or use cards or tokens representing RPS If you win its your stat  their stat in damageIf you loose  its your stat  their stat in damageIf you tie its just your stat in damage.The reason its like this is because you can compare your stats and figure out a safe play  you can take your rock your rock  their scissors or your rock  their paper  and determine a range of damage. repeat for other stats and determine min damage for each stat and just go with the highest or you can risk damage and gamble by throwing something else.,tabletopgamedesign,dg0m00c,4,t5_2szh7
11575070,0,t3_6572bf,I played a lot of illuminati in college. It along with Settlers of Catan was my first foray into the new board games. It did have a fatal flaw that eventually made it unplayable once everyone was experienced. The first person to try to go out win could always be stopped by the other players banding together. Then another player would swoop in to win. So eventually we learned to never be the first person to try to win. Once everyone learns this the game drags on literally forever. Thats not really the point though other than you should avoid that. Different enough is very difficult to measure. Some games feel like other games in game play some games share similar themes. I think as long as you dont do both for the same external game youre fine. ,tabletopgamedesign,dg81gk4,2,t5_2szh7

11586695,0,t3_65aqsc,Im no expert on the topic but these are the elements I would like to convey if I took on this projectRisk vs Reward Distileries could and did explode and I can picture that being a result of pushing your luck. I would say once you reach a certain point you could start turning up the heat and trying to crank out batches faster at the risk of losing investment and workers. Rivalry With everyone being an outlaw players would be allowed to kidnap workers steal materials or sabotage production in a world without police reports only eye for an eye rivalry. Fast and the Furious Moonshine is a product but also a fuel. Moonshiners are the grandfathers of NASCAR and generally drove custom souped up cars to outrun the cops. Many ventures into town might end in a chase and perhaps at times players can race to solve grievances. ,tabletopgamedesign,dg9cxvi,6,t5_2szh7
11649044,0,t1_dggc9v1,Well that particular list is not specific of course but yes I do find that by kinda scoping what I want to achieve helps me focus on getting somewhere. After a list like that Ill often try to come up with an outline very basic of what I might picture the general game turn to look like then start fleshing out each part. Its never right on the first try and takes several iterations but I do find that for myself having a what were my design goals? to check against can help me figure out what is fitting and what isnt.Its only one method of course but without some kind of focus its easy to keep coming up with new things to throw into the game which can just make it cluttered and even harder to balance and refine. Ive heard it said by other game developers that you know when a game is done not by when you cant think of anything else to add to it but when you cant find anything else to take out.,tabletopgamedesign,dggfltp,1,t5_2szh7
