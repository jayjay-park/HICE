8715032,0,t1_d6sa4ch,Been to  prides in  years cried at both. The first year was because it was the first time I was around out gay people in my entire life and they were happy tears this year there was a really gorgeous Orlando tribute at the very beginning and the entire street went silent for about  minutes which was heartbreakingly beautiful. ,butchlesbians,d6v0mhy,2,t5_3fv2t
8724734,0,t3_4zh6gt,Ill date basically anyone gender presentationwise and I definitely notice butch girls that I think are cute. Usually more on the soft butch end of the spectrum but not exclusively. Ive tried to decide whether my very wide open preferences when it comes to women are a factor of my theoretical seeing as how Ive never had a longterm relationship with a guy and dont particularly want one in the foreseeable future bisexuality then decided it kind of doesnt matter because it is what it is really. I will say that since coming out and embracing my preexisting butchness more fully Ive encountered way more people who tell me that they think Im cute and attractive the way I am which has done wonders for my self confidence. The first time my ex told me she thought I was hot I was like,butchlesbians,d6w8f1w,8,t5_3fv2t

9096381,0,t3_54p2ad,I actually dont identify as butch but I dont think anyone would browse the rnolabelbutIlooklikeaboy subreddit. But yeah I am definitely not butch enough! My gf and I both love cute things. She just likes purses and clothes and such and I like stuffed animals and cute characters. We can both agree on cute animals though. Also she can pick me up and carry me a little bit but my arms are noodles.,butchlesbians,d858luy,6,t5_3fv2t
9098899,0,t3_54va3c,I bind for Civil War reenactments where I do a male military impression but thats about it. I dont feel any particular inclination to bind the rest of the time and I have pretty nice boobs frankly and theyre a reasonable size so I dont particularly want to get rid of them. If I had especially large breasts or something I might feel differently. As someone else said though if I found out that I was at elevated risk for breast cancer or anything like that Id go under the knife pretty much immediately.,butchlesbians,d85jh4t,2,t5_3fv2t
9104767,0,t1_d868s34,I ignored a couple people and then realized that it wouldnt solve anything. They can have their shoutbox and Ill have mine,butchlesbians,d868w94,2,t5_3fv2t
9139354,0,t1_d8aew7x,Yeah with that reaction Id drop a guy like a hot potato. I dont want to be someones fetish either. Ive only had one relationship with a dude but it happened pretty much by accident. We were friends first. He assumed I was gay and I hid my attraction because I thought it would never be reciprocated. It was just dumb luck we ended getting together at all. Luckily he doesnt have any gross attitudes about gender.,butchlesbians,d8ah9my,5,t5_3fv2t
9199598,0,t3_56awqb,I use Pomade as its the only thing Ive found that has good hold and washes out properly. Short back and sides here with a few inches left on top. ,butchlesbians,d8i47tr,2,t5_3fv2t
9221506,0,t3_56lxdp,I usually wonder how much their feelings of entitlement to comment on my bodyappearance stem from me being a woman. This happened to me over and over again growing up and tbh I just went with it. A few days of makeup perfume and form fitting clothing and then slide back to jeans and a Tshirt.,butchlesbians,d8kw6iq,9,t5_3fv2t
9830178,0,t3_5fztmv,Genderqueer butch here. Butches are gorgeous. I happen to be married to a femme but if I wasnt I certainly wouldnt keep butches out of my dating pool. Dont change for other people.,butchlesbians,daow6na,6,t5_3fv2t
9953076,0,t1_db4wmts,Wait. So Im a bit but are saying that about all types of combat boots? Or just this brand of boot?Also idk if this changes anything but I do live in a mountainousrural area. So the boots would be functional for me as well as fashionable.,butchlesbians,db4wtc9,8,t5_3fv2t
10119357,0,t3_5k9lwp,My grandparents got my sisters and I matching ring holders. Very nice but I dont wear any jewelry at all. They even commented about it though so maybe itll change going forward. I did only just come out to them so I understand if they havent adjusted yet,butchlesbians,dbqk5pf,1,t5_3fv2t
