306152,0,t3_1xlwng,In case people think this is unrelated to the question of Assange the moderators have also voiced support for the campaign against WikiLeaks and denounced the WSWS for opposing the extradition campaign. Important points from the articleAmong the most infamous recent cases is the witchhunt against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Those advocating the banning of the WSWS express full support for the vendetta against Assange led by the Obama administration. The same moderator who announced the ban declares in one post that there are other examples of WSWS apologizing for rape such as defending Assange.Such forces have absolutely nothing to do with leftwing politics. Their politics are defined not by what they call themselves but by what they do. As for the use of the term socialist it should be recalled that the Nazis called themselves national socialists.Speaking on behalf of highly privileged sections of the uppermiddle class these elements are anticommunist antiMarxist proimperialist and intensely hostile to the working class.They willingly and enthusiastically line up with the state and its media appendages. The identity politics they pioneered have been adopted as a basic component of bourgeois ideology.

You are underestimating what can be done especially by the NSA and such organizations.Since you wont google ... just a surface scanUAB pointed outIf an attacker can imitate a victims voice the security of remote conversations could be compromised. The attacker could make the morphing system speak literally anything that the attacker wants to in the victims tone and style of speaking and can launch an attack that can harm a victims reputation his or her security and the safety of people around the victim.For instance the attacker could post the morphed voice samples on the Internet leave fake voice messages to the victims contacts potentially create fake audio evidence in the court and even impersonate the victim in realtime phone conversations with someone the victim knows Saxena said. The possibilities are endless.The researcher team used the Festvox Voice Conversion System to morph the voices testing machinebased attacks against the Bob Spear Speaker Verification System using MOBIO and VoxForge datasets. The attacks included different speaker attack basically faking out a machine to believe the attackers voice belongs to the victim and a conversion attack which could replace the victims voice with the attackers this could potentially lock a victim out of a speakerverification system that gives random challenge each time a victim users tries to login or authenticate to the system.Anyways that was a long time ago in software and cloud based neural network machine learning with random back sampling and all that shit.  In all that time machine learning could have been refining all that software just mentioned with just the ideas thrown up there on what needs to be done and believe me they have thought about that stuff because its all pretty obvious so I think it is VERY likely a technology they have right now.Combining that with video would be much more difficult but also not impossible and the day is coming.

If it didnt cost so much to get re elected there would be many more good politicians out there then there are now and it would make a big difference. Trump really doesnt have to rely on special interests because he could fund his campaign  if he chooses. That is a big deal.

Users should collaborate a list of known employees and scour their personal accounts for images of forms or computers left in the open. We typically are unconscious to this type of privacy invasion. Although some forms like embassy cats appear to be cryptic clues as to things assange wanted us to know. Others may be just accidental drops  Just a hunch if we get enough users we can translate them into readable texts. Notice this was an obvious dropping of forms. HD cam etcUsers should post all wikileaks related images on these that may contain clues or forms monitors etc. If your good with picture editing state it and tell users to PM you. SAY PHOTOSHOP PRO.

Published statements by Swedish authorities about the interviews at the embassy curiously avoid any mention of JAs actual physical presence at the meetings. They refer only to questions put to an Ecuadorian prosecutor. The election is over. Assanges internet has not been restored. Where is WLs outrage and why does it appear theyre not even trying to press Ecuador on this issue? Direct address of WL readers urgent and persistent questions around JAs whereabouts since  are puzzlingly absent from JA interviews purported to have taken place after . WL has yet to produce a single encrypted message using JAs public key. Although this is a simple reasonable request it remains to be done. Why? WLs oddly glib responses to questions of JAs whereabouts  referring only to evidence suggesting JA is ok. Evidence suggesting is is not provision of absolute proof.

9696184,0,t1_da876k8,It helps to understand what a precommitment hash is usually for. Lets say you are certain of a given fact a fact which later will become known to the public and which you do not wish to influence the event. You can write down a statement of the fact and compute a hash of it then publish the hash. After the fact has been made public knowledge you can reveal the string you hashed and people can compare the hash to the hashed value of the string and confirm that you had knowledge of the fact before it became public.For example lets say you knew for certain that the cubs would win the world series and you knew this in July. You could hash the string The Chicago Cubs will win the  World Series. with sha to get the value eaadeddccbbbdbaaceebaafaabaeb. You publish the latter and wait for the World Series to complete. Then you release the string which people hash and compare to the hash your released in July. Then you sit back and feel smug about your prediction.,WikiLeaks,da89e29,5,t5_2qy11

The minute any form of protest or dissent threatens to create meaningful and significant change the system will meet it with force.gtYoure actually ignoring my one and only point and claiming Im arguing something that Ive never put forward as an argument. The straw man Im referring to is the one that takes into context the whole discussion from start to finish. If youre selective about which argument youre talking about then you can construe anything as a strawman.Point in case being the original poster raised the following pointgtOnce they have the publics backing to stomp down on fake news theyll have the authority to ban any news they dont like and the increased power to push their agendas.Saying gtfunny because thats all i see you guys doingignores the original point being made and raises a new point being that people in this sub are trying to suppress any news that doesnt fit their narrative.  a point that was never put forward by op and that also happens to be incredible unimportant in the larger context of of how an entire media system functions a group of people on a discussion forum has very little if any bearing on an entire media industry that is responsible for curating and disseminating information to the masses.If you want logical reasoned discussion you first respond to the original point that was raised i.e. that an entire media industry network is attempting to supress any form of news that doesnt fit their agenda you either present reasons as to why you think this isnt the case or acknowledge that it is the case  and then you can start talking about alternatives or make the point that the existing system is the best weve got and doesnt require change.Saying yeh but ur a hypocrite doesnt do anything to advance logical and reasoned discussion and serves only to derail the entire discussion. Which is precisely why we are here arguing about logical fallacies instead of discussing the very real and current problem of the existing media system in the United States.Kapish?gtThe point is the hypocrisy of this sub. Theres nothing straw man about thatThe original point was never about that and even if it was the issue of a multibillion dollar media industry that tries to push their agenda like a bunch of keyboard warriors on a discussion forum is a far greater issue.So please think logically next time youre going to be selective and construe a valid argument as a strawman  because it just serves to damages your credibility.,WikiLeaks,daejruz,1,t5_2qy11

9754294,0,t1_dafdpq2,Tor works by passing information through multiple peoples computers essentially volunteers their computers known as nodes and eventually having one node access whatever site the original user wanted to access this node being called the exit node. Most ways of using Tor will change the set of nodes you use on a regular basis. As Tor gathered lots of plainperson volunteers the idea was that the original internet user is entirely obscured by the many normal people who were simply offering their connection as nodes who would have no interest in tracking the original user down.It WAS assumed this was totally secure but in Snowden leaks its been shown that the NSA has devoted a LOT of computers and connections to run Tor nodes. By providing some large age of nodes the NSA is essentially able to abuse their position to track the origin of users using Tor to browse sites.And because lots of computers and connections are compromisable the NSA usually only needs to be any single node in a chain of  or more nodes to track the protocol back to the original user. And so while Tor is still an okay security measure to use in addition to others it alone will not stop you being tracked anymore.,WikiLeaks,daffo4r,9,t5_2qy11

10149169,0,t3_5l8rug,While I assume most know whom the BilderBergs are I will give a brief run down of their organization as I understand it and its formation.There are secret societies of industrial political and royal elite. Some go by names such as the Free Masons or Illuminati while others have no name. The Bilderbergs were such a society operating immediately post WWII. While Their given name is not known they originated or rather were spotted holding a meeting in Hotel Bilderberg in the Netherlands or some such part of BeNeLux.So this puts us around . Around such time and ever since Henry Kissinger has been heavily involved in leading the organization. It was speculated that JFK suggested that such elite international organizations posed a threat to Democratic Nations as Roosevelt said many many times.In either case from  to  and including a future meeting scheduled in about  months Finance Ministers Presidents Kings Queens Military Interests Banks and Industrial CEOs have gathered to discuss global political matters in private and one such meeting the public labeled the Bilderbergs a name they later took on.What makes the Bilderbergs unique is their long history and relatively public persona as its the most public display of global collaboration or colluding as it was once labeled. While the meeting locations are secret such royalty can not go amiss and I do mean royalty. Frequently youll find a dozen kings and queens at such events.One Notable Attendee is Hillary Clinton. Her attendance can be found in the Presidential archives in  with an email subject that reads FLOTUS at Bilderberg Conference. However there are many many more interesting figures from virtually all bank and military CEOs to raw material manufactures to many tech commanders and I believe Obama around time of inauguration. Oddly there are virtually no celebrities  movies stars and no one not directly involved in international politics.Oddly the American Public is largely unaware of its existence or the acknowledgment there of. True News Anchors were so misinformed that they suggested it was the Build a bear club and that the public was more interested in build a bears then some private event.These events take place exclusively in Star Hotels in which all the staff is replaced with private personnel and the local governments grant the group use of local military and police forces. Over time the groups has developed its own semimilitary force that is akin to a large group of secret service outfits.All discussion at such meetings is strictly forbidden to be shared with the public. However it has been leaked or ascertained that the groups  attendees or so are broken down into groups of  to vote and discuss political matters and it is said that no names or titles are permitted and of course any recording. It is a no name group of no named individuals who discuss nothing but contain within the primary actors of nearly all Western societies.There are many such groups but there are no known or speculated groups with a larger public scale of influence. Likewise the founding fathers were members of the Sons of Liberty a private group intent on overthrowing the government or rather protecting the people by marshaling such a force unstoppable by a government but it was composed primarily of small folk and was demonized where as this group is protected POn their website prior to the hack they had lists of meeting topics. Some such topics would include relations between the US and Russia others the  Presidential Elections... and my personal favorite the internet and the diffusion of power. These are merely published talking points and it cant be ascertained what is really discussed only the majority of who is assembling based on the coordinated disappearance from the public eye round August coupled with areal photography and known associates in the area.However according to True News its all too confusing without a lolly.,WikiLeaks,dbuftke,40,t5_2qy11

Thats really all there is even though I do admit it comes off often as an accusatory tone.It will always come off as accusatory due to the nature of power politics and WikiLeaks position in the global political framework. WikiLeaks existence enables another avenue to force global stalemate. It makes all world powers significantly less powerful. At the moment it is impossible to measure whether that has improved or worsened various things. For example has it allowed better policing of human rights violations or has it deterred policing of human rights violations? Many nonAmerican nonBritish observers have claimed the former. Many Democrats in the U.S. have been quick to claim the latterjust as many Republicans did just seven years ago and ten years ago.

11085236,0,t3_5ya2b3,There are three things that make this a big deal. More will be revealed in future releases. The CIA created these tools and vulnerabilities and then lost control over them. Its bad enough that the CIA is using them with no oversight but now contractors and possibly agents themselves have sold then on the black market or possibly used them personally. These tools can be used on all of our electronics. Doesnt matter if you have a Mac or PC Apple or Android. Now criminals and nonUS state actors can use these exploits. This database they have including foreign tools aquired from other countrys hackers can be used to write code in a way to make the attack seem to originate from any country. This means when someone goes off on Russia makes claims that there is proof Russia hacked the DNC servers or Podestas emails they arent valid anymore. Crowdstrike based their analysis on the evidence on the server and the evidence left could have been made into looking like it came from any country. This release ruins the Russian argument. It can no longer be said that that Russia hacked the elections. It has already been shown that Guccifer . was a DNC creation to make the leak look like it was a Russian hack. This release helps back that up. The NSA is bad enough with their backdoors but at least there is a little checks and balances in them. The CIA kept these tools hidden so they can use them with impunity. There is no oversight and the tools are so powerful it will only lead to gross abuses of power. I suspect that future releases will show the CIA using these tools domestically. They wouldnt be able to use the results of these tools in a court of law but they dont need to. They are used to spy and likely blackmail people. Imagine the CIA being able to blackmail members of Congress and force them to do what they want and give them support.This is bad stuff and it is only the start of it.
