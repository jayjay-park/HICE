6454814,0,t1_czmlccf,Ive been a long time supporter of Ron Paul as well as Rand but I would argue that it is they who dont understand blowback.  Lets start with analogy  say you see a guy beating up a woman.  You step in and try to stop him and then he turns to you and tries to beat you up.  Youve just experienced blowback.  Its unfortunate that this blowback happened but you would never in a million years say that it was wrong to step in and stop him because he would turn his attention to you.If we take the case of ISIS they are ruining millions of lives in unimaginable ways.  The right thing to do is to stop them.  Just because the members of ISIS dont want to be stopped and will focus their attentions on anybody who tries to stop them blowback it doesnt mean its wrong to stop them.,TedCruzForPresident,czmyxht,5,t5_39bxd

7852268,0,t3_4mty86,The absence of stories of hardship from modern day socialist nations in the major media has created a lack in judgment regarding the use of socialist policies.  This is why Sanders is as popular as he is.  Young adults are completely unfamiliar with the tales that came from the USSR.  Its very similar to vaccinations.  Young adults have never seen polio therefore they have developed a lack of fear of it.

8347404,0,t3_4tvwys,Trumpsters will swear up and down and have been for many many months that they dont need or want the support of Cruz or even that of his supporters. Yet they are so furious that he didnt BEND THE KNEE that they were booing him off the stage while he was talking about freedom uniting the party and the constitution. Yeah good luck with that.I was almost there. All the Muslim and BLM bullshit over the last  months had me with one arm in the so called coat. But last night reminded me that some things never change Trump supporters are an utter horror show and it comes straight from the top. I refuse to take part in it.
