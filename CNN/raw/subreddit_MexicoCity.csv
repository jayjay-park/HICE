10638570,0,t1_ddd66vw,Thanks. I might end up using uber a few times. But I dont think I will have data on my phone when I am in Mexico so I will have to rely on Wifi a lot. Which is part of why I was trying to  find a more reliable alternative,MexicoCity,dddacak,2,t5_2tw1p
10746241,0,t3_5tq7p0,Hey excited to hear youll be staying here in my favorite city for a few nights! I have some general tips but lmk if you have specific questions! Within the city Uber or UberPool works well and is very cheap! No need to navigate the complex metro system.Some of the authorized taxi companies at the airport are Yellow Cab Aeropuerto TransfersUSA Nueva Imagen Porto Taxi and Sitio . However the people at the booth may sell you a more expensive ticket normally for a large van. Say you want a sedn SAYDAN and anything headed to downtown will be about  pesos.Things to doplaces to walk aroundPaseo de Reforma  Grab or rent a bike and come to this large avenue that runs through the heart of Mexico City  the city closes the entire street until afternoons on Sundays! The street is surrounded by beautiful buildings and classic architecture including the famous El ngel de Independencia monument. Parque Mexico on a weekend dayJog around Calle Street AmsterdamXochimilco  One of the best times Ive had in Mexico City was drinking and eating on the colorful boats trajineras of Xochimilco a notsocentral neighborhood of Mexico City. This might be complicated to navigate if you dont speak Spanish but definitely worth looking into! Coyoacn  This bohemian beautiful neighborhood of Mexico City is great for a daytime activity. There is a huge market here thats full of handycrafts and unique souvenirs that are perfect as gifts! We recommend visiting the Frida Kahlo house. Go to El Morral and order the Chile en Nogada you wont regret it!.Centro Historico is great to visit for a peaceful afternoon.  Go see the Rivera murals to relax or go to Tacuba for breakfast!,MexicoCity,ddoe5rt,2,t5_2tw1p

11274918,0,t3_60vvge,Great pics! the neighborhood Hipdromo Condesa owes the hipdromo part of its name to the fact that the area near to Mexico park used to be a racecourse and the Condesa part is because it used to be the lands of the Miravalle countess when nobility was outlawed the place became an Hacienda and the main house of the Hacienda was at what it is now the Russian Embassy.You missed one of my favorite museums and you were twice a few steps away from it Templo Mayor museum is built near what it is the only ruins left of the old aztec city it has a stone stele bigger than the aztec calendar.,MexicoCity,df9zuog,3,t5_2tw1p
