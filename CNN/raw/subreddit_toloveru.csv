4107516,0,t1_crofbdx,Why does it seem like nobody sees Yami as best girl? Shes cute pure and is the character with the most development in the series. Hahaha not that I dislike Momo but sometimes I dont like how slutty she is.,toloveru,crohdfl,1,t5_2usnx

4920854,0,t3_3iaqk1,I watch for the heroines and comedy predominantly. I think both are done well  beyond just the fanservice. I definitely started the show for the ecchi but now I love it for the nonecchi moments. I typically just glance at the ecchi in the manga and go to the next page  Im not skipping the page but Im just more interested in the dialogue.,toloveru,cuet8zv,1,t5_2usnx

7622353,0,t3_4jk0qj,I think there is going to be development in the relationships the problem is its released monthly so theres a long amount of time between issues.    As for the girls in the harem I think it involves Lala Nana Momo Haruna Run Kotegawa Mikan Yami and Mea. Then there are other potential candidates such as Kyouko Rin Risa and more.    I think theyve got to be careful not to cram too many girls into it and girls that should not be in it. Like of the girls Ive listed Mikan shouldnt be in the harem. Possibly others.,toloveru,d38mdln,3,t5_2usnx

8223999,0,t3_4qxmrf,Here are the raws Senmanga MangaHeadFirst reactions Rito alone? Oh I see where this is going.. Haruna is so ecchi Her plans were cancelled.. heh wholl she think of first. Oh yeah Nemesis alone with Rito. I think I know what shell d... I guess I didnt.  I have been wondering how that rooftop situation would continue taking Momiokas personality into account and this delivered.  Im interested to see how the next one will play out.Edit And well Im really a bit annoyed that you call a translation of something raw... uYuYaShiro ,toloveru,d55k0zr,1,t5_2usnx
8337754,0,t3_4ts35l,This chapter was jam packed with interesting stuff. . It was mainly focused on Risa a character that rarely gets any big attention but with only  chapter she managed to gain more development than many others that have more screen time. I was happy because she is definitely a force to be reckoned with... She has a very laidback and friendly aura and she is a women that gets what she wants as seen from this chapter. Although she is not my favorite she is certainly on my top.. It was nice to see Lala Momo and Nana in their traditional outfits its been a long time since they last showed them being used.. We were able to see some familiar faces that extremely rarely appear even tho some were just mentioned Ritos Father and Mother as well as Zastin.. We also got treated to Mikans Brocon and Momos worries.. It was nice seeing Harunas reaction when she found out that Rito would be alone it shows that shes gaining more confidence in herself.. Yui being Yui is always nice too.. Of course Nemesis shenanigans are always welcomed to she makes everything more entertaining. And we got some info that she regain a lot of her power it mustnt be long before she is able to leave Ritos body.Overall it was a great chapter that fitted a lot of stuff but at the same time didnt felt like it was a cluster of stuff mixed together and was able to maintain context without loosing its track until the end.Looking forward to the next one as always. This chapter was able to leave me hyped for more.And of course we got  easter eggs to top it off ,toloveru,d5jrv1e,5,t5_2usnx

9047771,0,t3_546434,Girls involved would be funny but if guys such as Saruyama or Ren or even more hilarious the principal were sitting on toilet Rito Id love to see Ritos disgusted reaction. If it were Lala or Haruna hed enjoy it.Itd be nice to see a chapter like this though preferably as an extra the same length as the sponge chapter.,toloveru,d7zebhy,3,t5_2usnx

9538587,0,t1_d9opm7n,No you dont understand Rito already said that he likes Haruna and Lala is fine with it shes even happy to be that way if you remember so he takes both lala AND haruna as an example because he knows that this triangle relationship is fine for Lala but what about the other girls? Thats why he says its only hypothetical hes only half lying. He may suspect that she likes him but in this situation thats not a hint.,toloveru,d9otvc7,4,t5_2usnx

11524665,0,t3_64cxzx,The funny thing is In the first series the main protagonist Rito was featured on every cover twice on  whereas he only appeared on seven volumes in the sequel. Not counting the Limited Editions here of course.And in the tenth anniversary bunkoban release of the first series he completely vanished from the covers as only his female form Riko is featured on the back of the last volume.,toloveru,dg2bmqj,2,t5_2usnx
