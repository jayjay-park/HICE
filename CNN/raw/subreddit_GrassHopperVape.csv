Just because units are still going out with the issue doesnt mean that they lied about fixing the problem.They already paid for the parts they already have on hand. They identified an issue with one of those parts and fixed it for future generations.They still have to do something with all those parts they already have. Perhaps the manufacturer only allows refunds for a certain number of days and they already had them too long?In a case similar to what I just described it would be cheaper for Hopper labs to still send out the possibly faulty units and deal with the defects as they arise rather than not be able to use the parts at all.,GrassHopperVape,cupqwkd,1,t5_2yzcn

I preordered in July I know not that long ago and many people have been waiting longer yada yada yada when it said the estimated shipping date was September . Ive been monitoring the grasshopper for years and when I saw the preorder I assumed it was finally ready and ordered.  I didnt back because I didnt care about saving cash on a vape and I needed the money then.

6366314,0,t3_42ui95,I know that you are not wanting to spend an extra  but the firewood . is by far the best vape near that price range. Everything you can buy below that short of butane powered vapes like the lotus cannot even come close to the firewood. It is convection based like the grasshopper and the owner restocks frequently. Otherwise if you are super firm about the price range flower mate products are a good place to start. The MFLB is also a great option if you are down to master a technique driven vape. Also IMHO within the  limit I would dare say a desktop would still more worth the money. Is portability a huge concern?

10491019,0,t3_5q8bm3,Ive heard people are having luck doing that. The only trouble you may run into is someone not believing your product is authentic...but as long as youre willing to thoroughly verify it for them so they understand you actually have them I think you should be fine. Id make sure they can still claim the warranty themselves after the sale though.,GrassHopperVape,dcx9mva,1,t5_2yzcn
10491096,0,t3_5q6b1x,. I do think this is normal. I had similar feelings but I honestly now think its just that I was too used to combustionactually smoking. Try pulling harder than you are now if thats possible and I think that should help. Lately Ive been pulling on it about as hard as I can for  seconds at a time per puff.. I recommend just adding herbs in and tapping the side of the unit so they sift down. Packing a bowl lets it last longer and makes each individual hit more potent but youll have to pull much harder and youll have a bit of trouble getting the herbs out once youre done. Hell I still have trouble getting them out without packing the bowl. My personal recommendation is to alternate thin layers of herbs and kief until you fill it up. The kief really cakes up this way so mixing it in is probably ideal but idk how to do that without it turning into a huge hassle yet. I bought a funnel that fits the herb chamber practically perfectly and I honestly prefer just loading it by hand.. Batteries definitely charge reeeeeeal slow. My guess is about  hours empty to full? They also drain very quickly I only got one bowl out of a full charge on my first use but I think that can be improved just by being mindful of whether its on or not. What Ive been doing is turning it off as soon as I finish hitting it unless Im going to pass it off to someone then I just turn it back on when Im going to hit it again since it doesnt seem to cool down too quickly while its off. I have  batteries total so I dont think this is an issue I just charge them all whenever Im home or at a computer. Im waiting on an external battery charger hopefully thatll help speed the charge up.. Definitely pick up some batteries. Id say no less than  total. You might want an extra silicone mouthpiece since they get yellow pretty quick and can get lost easily but unless you want to use your hopper while youre cleaning your mouthpiecefront end an extra one front end I mean isnt really necessary.  Here are some tips I posted in my own post copy and pasted!. Compressed air works wonders for maintaining your Hopper inbetween actual ISO cleanings! Ive heard blowing air directly into the herb chamber can damage the sensor in it but I cant imagine that youd harm the sensor if you just shot the air through one of the airflow holes so itd come out the other end as if you were hitting it. The first time I used compressed air on my front end some lint bright orange from my hoodie lmao got stuck midway out of the mouthpiece and I pulled it out by hand from there.. Ryots Piper  carrying case is practically made for the Hopper. My Hopper fits PERFECTLY snug in the dab tool pocket included in the flap as long as I take off the silicone mouthpiece and I love the look of it. The bag is also perfectly sized and carries three pill sized containers one for ABV and two for herbs my grinder my concentrate container and pen a lighter chap stick eye drops and a funnel I bought to easily fill my Hopper and STILL has a bit of room left over. The stitching on the flap is a little iffy but I honestly dont mind it. The only other thing about it is that the magnets that keep the clasp closed are very weak and will fail if your stuff makes the bag bulge at all. I just fixed this by spending  on some washer shaped magnets that go in between the clasps. The magnets have actually made the bag more versatile since I can use them to hold lighterstoolsmy Hopper frontendetc.. Kief is AMAZING in the Hopper. I think this one is already posted elsewhere but it helps so much I had to say it again. My next move is buying some hash from the dispensary to crumble in with my flower. Im hoping itll give it that little extra oomph for when I want to get really blasted.edit sorry im bad at formatting how to fix jk fixed,GrassHopperVape,dcx9y6n,8,t5_2yzcn

I always stock up on batteries when I can get free shipping back with warranty.So I guess now HL have to make leeway with postage somehow theyve certainly sent a lot more parcels at their expense than they were hoping in the last couple of years.Ive paid  or  bucks total in postage to HL though theyve sent me  or  parcels so thats eating into their revenue stream and theyve made efforts to recoup it I guess.I wonder when the Ti PFEs will launch. I might switch to Ti then too but going to stick with plain metal so I can use PBW to clean them.,GrassHopperVape,dfkpsl5,1,t5_2yzcn
