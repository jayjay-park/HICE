6824313,0,t1_d0proaf,Yeah you really do! If cracking packs is your thing you might want to do Limited. The two types of Limited are Draft and Sealed. Draft is kinda complicated but you open packs and pass them around the table taking a card from each one then you build a deck from your picks and you play. Its a little more indepth than that but thats the basic premise. Sealed is when you open normally  booster packs and try and make a deck out of them then you play. ,MagicCardPulls,d0pu26g,1,t5_2vxxg
