561028,0,t3_20jgwm,I made a joke about it a while back but we are entering a sort of Post Vaporwave. Electronic music micro genres have always had the shortest life spans of most music. Before you can really pin it down the artists have moved on.Most of us making Vaporwave esque things are moving forward. The idea that sounds and styles can be remade into something new is the big takeaway from Vaporwave. Yes sampling did the same thing in a way long before Vaporwave but what other genre tried to repurpose some of the worst muzak ever?Also there is a wikipedia page for Vaporwave now so Id say its still got some room to expand. ,Vaporwave,cg41mxr,3,t5_2ugcd

IMO the stuff new artists are churning out is way better and way more refined than that of what people were beginning to experiment with  years ago. Any one can say oh vaperwave is dead but those are usually just the fuckboys who want to be on the cutting edge of something. Vaporwave wont die until something cool replaces it or until people stop experimenting and so far neither have happened yet.,Vaporwave,chcw0qz,2,t5_2ugcd

So its easy to make low budget basic vape. So thats pretty cool. They paid version is even more capable.Another easy to use web app is Audiotools.com Coolest feature is that it keeps the revision history of a sample across artists.

If you love it and want to support the artist then buy the album. If you just like listening to it now and then then you can still stream it.This would only be an issue if DC and other artistslabel flat out refused to let anyone enjoy their music without first paying for it.,Vaporwave,cvnnej0,5,t5_2ugcd

5914050,0,t3_3rmd02,Just think of whats nostalgic for you and try to capture it somehow. To me vaporwave is all about that feeling of nostalgia. Get A LOT of samples together. Dig deep for your samples and try to completely change to context of whatever samples you get. Chopping up a longer sample into its creative parts and seeing how many different ways you can restructure them can yield a lot of interesting results. Vaporwave is about a vibe and above all youve gotta feel that vibe to capture it. Just spend a lot of time imagining what your vision of the futurepast is and the ideas will flow. ,Vaporwave,cxuv4j4,1,t5_2ugcd

To give a bit of context this is in a neighborhood of off campus houses in a college town. Pretty quickly into the first tape a girl from a sorority house next to use started violently banging on our front door. Me and my gf when back inside to see what was going on and the girl from next door decked out in Ugs and full bitty uniform began screaming at us. She accused us of trying to mess with her and assalting her ears saying she knows what we are doing. I told her it was a bit egomaniacal to believe we were outside enjoying music just to fuck with her and that the world doesnt necessarily revolve around her. She ended the discussion by threatening that shed have the cops on us if we ever played that music again.,Vaporwave,cyzay90,8,t5_2ugcd

In a way I agree most artists should hold off and try to be better and the really good artists do ECO VIRTUAL Blank Banshee etc but at the same time constant releases show a genre hasnt died yet so theres something good to see in this.,Vaporwave,d2qaqep,2,t5_2ugcd

7661278,0,t1_d3d07pb,gt Do you listen to vaporwave?I have on occasion. Most of it is shit though. gtAll of those artists release on cassette because it provides an even better medium to make the music sound extra lofi.This comment is laughable a hifi systems supersede Lofi so any sound quality that you want to accomplish can be done through your own mastering and effect modules.gtIf you dont understand that concept then you are in the wrong subreddit for the wrong genre. And now were circling back to the pretentiousness. You should take a class in sound engineering because you have no concept of it.

Others are messy and walk around a lot.I remember about a year ago I tried starting another genre called metrosong dealing with stuff from the s instead of the s and s. The whole idea was that I wanted people to explore stuff like that and I used the tag as a way to abbreviate it.Of course some people in this scene find this very topic to be very sensitive for some reason and spend hours arguing about it online.I would say dont worry about genre labels. They only serve as a conversation piece for people who arent creating. Make something original that hasnt been tried yet thats how you get noticed.,Vaporwave,d8aead2,4,t5_2ugcd

9279057,0,t1_d8s2lkz,Thank you D It took up most of my summer it was a ton of work. I was very pleased with the outcome though. Its absolutely wild to be that things I made by hand in my bedroom ended up in cassette collections and even a few record shops across the globe. Yes! I will keep making them in small batches until the demand is lownonexistant. I just had to take a break for school this semester has been a little tough on me. The more popular stuff like SAMANTHA AFTER COLONY ECHOES SIM EARTH amp ARCADIA CAMPUS have definite plans to be reprinted. We hope to do those this winter thanks for stopping by and showing love lt ,Vaporwave,d8s6r62,5,t5_2ugcd

10180060,0,t1_dbxxwc6,Yea this is great really liking this album the big issue with field recordings of malls is they tend to lack any music i think its the combination of the crowd and background noises of people walking by combined with muzak echoing through long clinically clean hallways is what draws me to it. Greatly appreciate your recommendation was exactly the kind of thing Im looking for.Edit Yea youre totally right! About it being so soft they didnt even try to make a song around the recording.,Vaporwave,dbxys7n,3,t5_2ugcd

10733998,0,t3_5tikwm,cant speak about making money off of making samplebased vaporwave as i do this solely as a hobby. just mainly speaking of off observations and personal thoughts here. anyways something that ive seen and heard over the years that appears to ring true is that youre a fair bit less likely to get in copyright trouble if you use extremely rare and unknown samples. usually from artists that cant be found anywhere besides a few stray tracks. if you sample from a still active artist or from a fairly recent song youre taking more of a risk. and also i think the amount of transformation you put into your samples matters. for example bldwave made a song a couple of years back where he literally just slowed down an entire song from a fairly active and popular artist. no one said anything about it but pretty sure he got in copyright trouble for that as the track isnt on his bandcamp page for new visuals anymore.links for comparison original bldwavethat was a fairly extreme example but you get what i mean. i think sample accreditation is important even if it is uncleared but ultimately it might not mean shit if youre still making cash off it. all i can say is keep doing vaporwave to your hearts desire as long as it sounds good. ,Vaporwave,ddn4qqk,2,t5_2ugcd
