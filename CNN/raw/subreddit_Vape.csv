901197,0,t1_ch18ryy,Stop using pro tank.  Anything made by Kanger is great at first until you have to start changing wicks.  Kanger makes a billion items and their heating elements are weak and Ill made.  My suggestion by an aspire BDC or an aspire nautilus.  They are the same price and the build quality on the heating elements is WAY better.  Take it from someone who has used every version of the protank and protank mini.  Get an aspire. Hit me up with questions!  Happy Vaping!,Vape,ch6pyw8,1,t5_2r7y3
