I dunno its left to be everydayish to not that successfully bring more of a human side to Wesker I guess.I dont mean that the series should end or be rebooted. I want the story to continue keyword continue. Capcom should pursue the plot threads that have been hanging since back when or if thats too much to ask of the current writers the keep rotating in and out of the series at least move the overall story forward. Weve been getting standalone oneoff stories with the exception of RE since after Zero that have introduced and solved theyre own conflicts and story arcs within themselves.RE was supposed to fully deliver on the US goverment amp Umbrella connection and Adas story just like RE did on the Umbrellas origins arc Spencer and Wesker. It did passingly touch on the government connection but did absolutely nothing with Ada or almost none of the semiensemble cast which is pretty ridiculous.

It depends on the time frame between the Bravo team landing in the Arklay mountains and Alpha team coming to investigate.In the novel as soon as they lose radio contact with Bravo the Alphas are in their chopper within  minutes and on their way.

Like I said though storywise coop wouldnt make sense. They would also have to drastically alter a lot of aspects of the game number of enemies ammo and health item quantities for example. Coop would be weird with tank controls too imo. Not sure how they could really pull it off.,residentevil,ck24fdi,1,t5_2s0lb

I appreciate the kind words though and am glad someone else shares my feelings.I really do keep digressing Ive tried to write this for like  minutes now lol. But yeah battle music signifys when youre in danger and then out of danger. Which is detrimental in a game where you want the player unaware of danger.

Revelations  was also a pretty convincing proof for that you can still have an atmospheric horroresque game set in a remote location while using the rich lore of the series  and without it going RE .RE  was too big for its own good in every way but that doesnt mean that we need a reboot.

I think if youve only ever played  and Revelations its difficult to make an informed decision! The whole series had a significant tonal shift around Resident Evil  onwards and the Revelations series is what I see as an attempt to satisfy fans of the older games.

3724399,0,t3_331x7x,Remember near the beginning of Barrys episode  when he says half a year of chasing scraps. Hes been trying to find Moira since he met with Claire in the hospital. Like uCleverSexualInnuendo said that scene was a flashback to fill the time gap after Barry got knocked out by Alex.The big plot hole for me is the question of how Claire survived the leap from the tower who found her when and how? Maybe the giant exploding fireworks show attracted someone to the scene but something that highprofile would most likely have also attracted the attention of political powers to investigate andor quarantine the place or something. While Im at it did Alex or someone seriously hire scary special forces in gas masks to kidnap people in public with guns blazing and no one at all could figure out where they were taking their hostages and mount a rescue? Youd think someone might have since Claire was rescued by an unknown entity but if she was then why didnt her rescuer get to tell Barry right away where she was found?I know the DLC also handwaved Moira as being saved by Evgeny but even that part is pretty sketchy to me since he would have no reason to be up in the tower in the first place nor would he have any way of getting her back to his hideyhole with the tower collapsing in a show of explosions even before then and the thought of him uncovering all that rubble on top of her by himself with all of that going on is difficult to imagine.Whatever though. I stopped caring about the story making any sense around the time Barry destroyed my suspension of disbelief by using a handgun to break a crumbling ceiling in the exact way that he needed to escape some monsters.

4704610,0,t1_ctnjbih,Your entire argument is that you cant explain the entirety of the history of the series in just the cutscenes and dialogue which was never debated nor the point here. The point was that those are used to convey the driving plot of the games which is very much understandable from just them alone. This entire discussion is going around in circles due to you not understanding the difference.And again no it doesnt. You do know the word hinge right? The main form of presenting the narrative in a game and the form of which the majority of it is presented through are the cutscenes and dialogue not the files. The plot is almost exclusively presented through the cutscenes and dialogue unlike how you claimed it to be complete with the Gone Home comparison. All of those explanations youre listing are just backstory and not directly affecting the plot of the game which has been my entire point this time something youre seemingly incapable of comprehending.Im not lying or forgetting anything no. Wesker being a traitor is both foreshadowed and stated in the cutscenes as well. It is also expanded upon in the files as well but the point is gotten through solely with cutscenes and dialogue as well. Then again it wouldnt affect my previous claim either way.Im not mad and the assumed hatred is solely in your perception. Ive been reading every one of your previous replies carefully as you have to considering how incoherent they are.The main plot is conveyed through the cutscenes and dialogue and the files offer exposition on backstory that isnt directly affecting the main plot almost exclusively. Yet the main plot of each game is very much understandable just through cutscenes and dialogues and the files only offer extra for people who want to go through absolutely everything in the history of the series. Unlike games like Gone Home which are based solely on that type of presentation in theyre story Resident Evil present the most important aspect of each games story the driving plot through conventional means while expanding upon less important things through at time non conventional delivery which was the files and the setting.,residentevil,ctnjy21,0,t5_2s0lb

My one piece of advice would be to examine every item you pick up you can examine items in your inventory. It doesnt exactly explain it to you at the start so I think thats the only thing that would catch out new players. The puzzles are actually quite straightforward so you wont get stuck on them.

6139811,0,t3_3zlz8t,To be honest its impossible to say. We can only make guesses based on vague rhetoric and the people Capcom has been talking to. Theyre not going to listen to the fans outside of trying to make the game more polished Capcom are quite good about adding features players request for example because Resident Evil has one of the most fractured fanbases.My gut feeling is RE Remake will be a Revelationsstyle Revelations  most likely. Possibly with the same Leon does the shooting Claire supports him gameplay and REbutheavilytoneddown combat game with Resident Evil style atmosphere in terms of visual stylings. Think the urban chaos of the first chapter of Leons campaign. Car crash burning shit zombies breaking into a gun shop etc. RE was not a particularly scary game to begin with. I say this as someone who really loves the N version. So Capcom will have to work out how to make the game scary in some way without resorting to awkward controls and combat.,residentevil,cynj62b,1,t5_2s0lb

6722205,0,t1_d0ebwfp,How the hell do you figure? When I am playing a game I want to feel like I am controlling the person and IN the game. I wasnt even referring to the moving while shooting example but since you brought it up that is even more ridiculous to not include it. If I am a human being who can die and exist in a world full of not only zombies but enormous huge freaks that want to kill me... id want to be able to move while shooting. Sure id be a lot less accurate but I dont believe for a second that that would take away from the claustrophobia of the game. Maybe for you it might but Resident Evil is my favorite franchise of all time and even I like the old tank controls of the old games in the context of the games and when they were released I can enjoy them for what they are even the controls. However very awkward aiming and moving in RE is a step back in every way compared to Revelations . Hell Resident Evil Dead Aims movement is more tolerable. All I am saying is that if they want to bring a  year old game to the latest generation of console then they should update the controls or give you the option to use the latest controls. ,residentevil,d0emu0h,1,t5_2s0lb

6793161,0,t1_d0m98cd,Are you joking? We just got two rereleases from  years ago with a slight bit of more polish. And of course the revelations games are action over the top insane action for a lot of sections. Blasting hunters like crazy as jills partner as one example that immediately stands out. Theres countless others. And OTS does mean action. You can debate it but youre wrong. You can try to make it horror but it likely wouldnt work. The atmosphere changes too drastically. If you think horror is scary monsters and we can still have that with ots thats fine. I couldnt disagree anymore but your entitled to that. To me horror is a setting not knowing whats around the corner missing a shot and having it count not mowing through legions of enemies like superman like you do in every ots RE... I could go on forever but theres no point. You have no idea how wrong you are and nothing will change your opinion. But its not even opinion look at modern horror movies vs classics. Classics drip atmosphere and have a constant sense of looming dread. To parallel RE lets take Romeros zombie films for example. Legendary dark slow yet perfectly paced looming terror. Ots is like the dawn of the dead remake. Flashier shinier relying on jump scares because its not claustrophobic and cant be. No real fear of anything except a monster jumping out of a locker or something. The differences in our arguments are time tested in horror movies. Even Mario bava said that good horror is  choosing the right camera angles. You want the game to have a different feel and be something its not and theres no reason at all for it. Why not try just one single modern day horror game with fixed cameras to see if it works if its worth pursuing. Just one why even argue it?,residentevil,d0mali4,3,t5_2s0lb
6802387,0,t1_d0nb9qn,The atmosphere fixed camera angles creates isnt a good argument. Resident Evil  didnt have fixed camera angles and the atmosphere and story were good.

The controls felt clunky gunplay felt weird and the missions were alright at best. Plus the whole premise of the game to change Resident Evil History by giving you the choice to kill Leon and Claire barely comes up. I wanted multiples endings telling us what happened if we just killed Leon or if we killed them both. The whole point of the game is shoved to the back so we can play meh missions riding the nostalgia train. Hell even the ending feels so half assed. Literally the squad either kills both of them or tells them to escape and then it just fades to black. This game had good ideas but  most of it was badly executed which sucks because I was really looking forward to it. If it was remade I want more weight to the actions of the characters killing Leon andor Claire more original missions or at least missions adapted from the Outbreak games the controls to be better more integration of classic Resi characters and a campaign with branching paths with multiple endings.,residentevil,d302tpb,1,t5_2s0lb

Those might be clues towards finding the actual ending of the demo if there is one some of them seem to happen randomlyso far what triggers the sound ispulling the lever in the beginning walking up to the TV after getting the fuse as soon as the demo starts those two seem to happen randomly either one or the otherentering the corridor after the kitchen seems to be random walking up to the chained up cabinet after getting the bolt cutters sometimes happens after cutting the chain and not opening the cabinet for a few momentswalking up to the TV room with the tapefirst time youre on the nd floor after inserting the fuse sometimes happens without the fuse? fuck i dunnolooking at the wiring on the nd floor during the VHS section or at least looking at the ceiling and walls maybe the headsetlooking at wires in the hidden room in the VHS sectiongetting back to the first floor after picking up the phone using the backtothewall method i also had the key at the timethose are all that I found but there may be more.  Also theres a sound bite of a girl laughing and whispering something at the Press Any Button screen but its either too fast and quiet or in reverse.there better be something to this shit,residentevil,d48rul6,27,t5_2s0lb
7942401,0,t3_4o1lxe,I dont think it should be attached to the resident evil name. Looks more like what silent hills was trying to do mixed with the movie vhs. Looks good still but shouldnt have the resident evil name.,residentevil,d48st4r,0,t5_2s0lb
7942537,0,t3_4o0b6c,Im going to go out on a limb and say that this does not reflect the final product at all. Sure we see some kinda iffy stuff with the demo just played it once. Gotta play more to get the other endings that doesnt really relate to Resident Evil at all but I also see many similarities in context to Resident Evil .A team for an apparently shit American TV show are sent to a place that is reportedly haunted. The host being a skeptic is his thing. You play the lowly new camera man in the video tape thats played. SPOILERS AND PURE SPECULATION AHEADIn the end you end up figuring out that there is something bad in the house. Something seemingly possessed or evil a pseudo zombie. Im guessing that what this is is an isolated outbreak of some UmbrellaNeo Umbrella virus that was possibly pure speculation here leaked into a rural homecommunity for testing purposes. This isnt exactly what happened in RE because I dont remember it being intentional but still actually facilitated Umbrellas research.The family is then either killed or driven off by their daughter who has been contaminated by said virus. But before this happens she is successfully confined in the small space behind the hidden door. The people who investigate and are killed end up triggering the spread of said virus and thus ensues where the real story begins. I believe this is where the real characters will come in. BSAA or another group ends up investigating claims of large scale murder in this and other surrounding rural communities hence the likeness to RE and things will go sour.What we see in the trailer is literally the beginning before any of the beloved STARS members or other pivotal characters come in. This is the event that triggers their investigation.Or we may see a whole new slew of characters but I believe that this doesnt represent the final product at all. This in my opinion is a simple story launching device that will be made more clear with time.If this sounds crazy well maybe it is. But Im trying to be optimistic here. I quite enjoyed the atmosphere especially if this is what I think it is for a teaser. Far too often we see these zombie stories happen without seeing how it began. I like their take on the beginning if that in fact is the case.TLDR The teaser is an introduction to events that trigger more Canon Resident Evil appearances and lore.EDIT Thanks for the support on this comment everyone. I really thought this would get downvoted to hell. Im glad people are reacting positively and with a hopeful nature for what RE hopefully becomes.,residentevil,d48tcxg,87,t5_2s0lb

7950621,0,t3_4o0mhc,Okay Ive tried about  different times all doing different things. Im pretty sure the first thing to do is turn off the back ground music this helps you listen to all of the small clicking noises which Im pretty sure means something changed or the outcome of doing something has changed.There was one time where I didnt pick up the dash note in the beginning didnt pick up the dummy finger or anything else and just went to the bolt cutters got the video completed it and then opened the small secret passage. The key was there but the fuse was NOT there may be a clue may mean a for sure death idk.Im also pretty certain there is a secret passage in the telephone room never have gotten it open but Im pretty sure you have to do a certain sequence of things to use the piano and I think the piano will open the passage in the phone room or the locked door in the first hallway. I also noticed that looking at the picture of the helicopter causes a clicking noise almost every time so like one of the community guys said it has something to do with progressing further maybe the piano and the picture are connected. Im stumped still but these are some things Ive noticed I havent seen talked about yet.,residentevil,d49q48p,7,t5_2s0lb
7951182,0,t1_d48tcxg,I didnt think about it until I saw your comment... but the whole Tv Show aspect. Makes me think of Sweet Home the NES game that inspired the original Resident Evil. If I remember correctly you play as a group of people working on a documentary in an old run down supposedly haunted mansion.

7985004,0,t3_4ok8ws,In addition to all youve said I firmly believe the atmosphere will be perfect as well as the switch to first person. When I thought about it for a moment it all made sense. The perspective is crucial. The fixed cameras of the first few games set up the hesitation and reluctance and mystery and I believe this new first person view will as well. Im kind of imagining how it was as a kid for me. In the earlier games youd hear that zombie groan or clicking of something walking and you held your breath and either waited for it to appear on camera or you had to go confront the mystery noises yourself. The first person just seems like a great way to return to this. Patiently waiting for something to turn the corner your axeor whatever weapon raised in defense mentally shitting yourself. Or even taking the initiative to peek around the corner to see for yourself. Pushing the doors open not knowing what to expectlike playing the door opening cutscenes from the early games for yourself.I really do believe the formula theyve chosen to go with is the best way to carry the series forward at this point in time. ,residentevil,d4dl940,2,t5_2s0lb

Otherwise why can we see the ghost girl but no one else. Also the tape being dirty could be due to time since we dont know the time gap between tape and current time. it does seem like quite a good amount of time has passed. If you notice in the opening and closing video the guy from the film crew derping on his name atm has grown a bit of a beard which i find odd no ones seemed to have mentioned before. Kinda at a dead end so trying some alternate thinking when possible. As for the old camera looks to me like the kind of camera a studio would of used back in the day im getting old XD.

Resident evil has always been based on Backtracking and each player is free to solve the puzzles in the order they want. Crows has been there in every game of the Franchise in RE they would attack you if you pick the rocket launcher from forest or in the room with the paintings on the walls in the  Except for a part where you would get attacked in the police station after they break windows and  nothing to remember about. After the th episode they were only target who drops ammos more chance to get grenades that was fun kamikaze Crows.The Piano were interactive you had take partitions with Jill and let Rebecca learn the song moonlight sonata.

8141977,0,t1_d4v8gso,I dont see it that way.When I first got the game I thought it was pretty dope. It actually creeped me out when I got to the ship. The thing I love about Revelations  is that sets a tone. You get in there and things just dont look right. These flesh on the floor bodies and blood and everything looks so strange and organic. The rain and the swaying of the ship even to the point where it knocks me around? I lovr details like that. It was a nice touch to an already immersive game. So when I go inside that room and that Ooze thing walks past the light it actually freaked me out. Like What the hell was that tall thing? It reminds me if Dead Aimanother weird but great and underrated game in the series. That game took place on a boat. The ship in that game was like a precursor to the Zenobia in some ways because it was really really creepy and scaryall the creaking and echoing noises. Capcom put alot if time and attention into that game too more or less when it came to the atmosphere.Resident Evil isnt just about the guns and shooting. Its also about atmosphere. REmake set a tone. The music helped but almost every room in that mansion had some kind of personality to them. Same with Resi   the village anyone? All those Ganados coming at you one wielding a fucking chainsaw! Resi  with the shanty towns and even Resi  with the college in Leons story I love the little China apartments in Chriss story  I found that to be kinda creepy especially in Adas campaign.

8672993,0,t3_4ymuc1,I truly feel like Resident Evil was a victim of Hollywood. The movies came out and literally made Alice a superhero. I think Capcom thought that it was what audiences wanted and the games followed suit. The first movie came out which was a horroresk run and gun action movie and the next year  came out with a more action oriented gameplay from previous games. Then things just kept getting worse as the films came out alongside  and . Extinction came out stating the virus had spread worldwide and  followed suit with most of Africa. The games fed off of the momentum of a bunch of terrible movies. Then Capcom realized that people who liked the movies werent the same as those who had been fans of the games and are trying to get back to what the fans actually want with .

So unless you mean to say that CV doesnt use fixed camera AT ALL then you might have a point.gtThis is assuming that prerendering is worse in every way exceptWell... yeah!  a static picture will never look as good as something that is rendered in real time.gtMost of them are only on par with the PSXbone.Thats what i meant actually if the PS generation consolespc could do that so easily i think its safe to say that the current hardware doing that even better is a given at this point. I mean cmon its ! k is about to become the norm very soon.gtThe vast majority of critical and popular opinions said the same thingI never said they dont look great! im just saying that graphics rendered in real time could look EVEN BETTER than that prerendered backgrounds are only used in a situation when devs cannot rendered it in real time.,residentevil,d6ptmhx,1,t5_2s0lb

On PS the store says Yakuza  is  GB but really you need  GB of free space so that the installer can be downloaded and then install the game. After the game is finished installing your console will delete the installer leaving the advertised file size. Now Im not entirely sure but I think the PS Store on PS says the full size for installer and game. At least thats what it seemed like when I downloaded the Division a few days ago but Im not entirely sure so dont quote me on that.

Dying Light to some extent did in first person.I want more gameplay flexibility which provides for a better experience and more immersion. I want to be able to open and leave doors open if I choose for easier escape for example while running the risk of having enemies pursue me further etc.Dynamic lightning and D environment provide flexibility and better immersion. You recall the scene in the library where you go through the balcony ? That was heavily scripted for no reason whatsoever besides technical limitations it could be a smooth transition.Same story characters location weapons and enemies is not asking for a new game but a freshinnovative take.Why settle for great when this game could be amazing.Since they probably cant use any of the old assets they are building this from scratch.

Veronica X has a  and PS port.If you want a sample platter of Resident Evil and its different genre shifts then do REmake and RE first and then go from there. If you like REmake youll like   Veronica X and . If you like  youll be comfortable with  and Revelations.  you should experience well all of them you should experience but its basically fanfiction even for a series with as insane of a story as Resident Evil and its more much more similar to modern shooters far more than even  so keep that in mind. Also if you want a to do a summer class sped up equivalent of RE story with a good game to back it up do Umbrella Chronicles since it covers   and  this is what I did first and you get up to speed pretty quick. Idk what Darkside Chronicles covers but I think its basically everything else mainline.Since you seem mainly focuses on knowing the story Im sure you know about the general jist of the Raccoon City and Arklay Manor incidents and basically every other RE story uses elements of them as a basis so if you know the essentials of them youre golden you dont need to know the ins and outs of RE and  LeonClareJills stories to get the RC incident also.  might as well be standalone story wise even though its one of the best single player games out there although  sharing its core gameplay is pretty involved with stuff from previous games eventually.All of these since youre looking to play all of the main games you should be waiting for a sale for and you will save a good chunk of change.,residentevil,d7sy5k0,1,t5_2s0lb

9043943,0,t3_542d2q,Out of curiosity what were the grounds for rating these titles? I get horror is subjective but Im curious about what you guys looked at when choosing not only the titles but the ranking as well. As far as your question of Resident Evil being shorted I dont think it was. You included two titles and they fell relatively high. But...Im not a big fan of a lot of the list. I guess its personal preference but Id drop Killer  Eternal Darkness Silent Hill  and Resident Evil  from the list and replace them with titles like Condemned Criminal Origins OutlastAmnesia Fatal Frame  Call of Cthulhu Penumbra and even Dead Space many of these were honorable mentions but I dont understand why they wouldnt make the list over a lot of the tiles you had. And Im actually kind of stunned by the choice for scariest moment of REgtAfter putting up a reasonable fight against the evil townspeople in the games first environment you encounter a chainsawwielding maniac wearing a sack on his head. If he catches you you dont just take damage  you die. He cuts yo damn head off. I guess theres that lowonammunition I dont want to do this again feeling you get when Doc Salvador shows up but the fight is optional as long as you dont go into the shotgun building or approach the farm gate.  Not only that its something that happens frequently. Theres so many instances of fighting Chainsaw Men and Sisters that they just arent intimidating anymore and feel more like gnats as the game progresses. I mean you missed out on numerous other instances  Kitchen guy the verdugo chase U  that were oneofatime instances in the playthrough. Actually looking at the list it feels like its primarily console based and falls in the Psera of gaming minus Silent Hill and The Count Lucanor Ive actually never heard of this and think Im going to try it out tbh. This is upsetting honestly because you open up with talking about your first experience being Alone in the Dark which is iconic.

Um if you played FF games from  to  you know perfectly that they all have differences but were ALWAYS exclusively about turnbased combat so I am not sure at all what you mean by saying that numbered mainentry FF game being a action jrpg isnt strange... Seems like a huge contradiction to how these games were made since the very start... I dunno but I am pretty sure that if logic is still prevalent in this world then I am supposed to be right on this one...Also stating Kingdom Hearts as a example to FF is at least a bit strange... You know because its a other series completely ? Like absolutely completely ? Also I didnt make any concern over Silent Hill being a pachinko machine I just wanted to show you that we live in the world where SOMEBODY decided that that would be a good idea to do. Just think about it for a second  making a Silent Hill  for pachinko machines just give it a thought a game where you put money into a slot machine which is based on one of the most influential and devastitingly emotional experiences a gamer could get basically making people reconsider if games are an art form...

9949300,0,t3_5i0jq5,Well you should play the games that youre actually enjoying playing first. If you finished playing  and a quarter of  my recommendation is to go ahead and play Claire ALeon B then transition to RE or RE.As far as RE goes I believe I know what part youre stuck on blind guy in a cell with bells all around. If youre completely out of ammo your only hope might be running back to the merchant and upgrading the ammo capacity for your guns to get a full magazine or to buy another gun from him for the ammo. If you have frag or incendiary grenades you can use those too. If this is the part youre stuck at be aware that only shots to the creature on the mans back do damage to himeverything else is a waste of ammo.In RE that boss has a weakness to fire and theres a flamethrower in the arena that you can use to exploit that weakness. If youre playing solo it can be difficult but its still definitely possible.You can watch Degeneration whenever all that matters is that you have an idea of what happened in Resident Evil  as far as RE is concerned Leon acts very differently in Degeneration than in RE and Hunnigan makes a cameo.Id recommend RE last for story purposes RE and RE are heavily referenced and RE concludes an overarching global bioterrorism plot line that starts in RE.,residentevil,db4f44f,3,t5_2s0lb

When your stuck in an enclosed space with limited exits that might not be the best idea.Hospital are too crowded and sick people would rush to them.Apartments have people which makes them dangerous. Theyre also kind of death traps depending on how theyre designed. They have limited exits and some are built on top of eachother.Banks have secured vaults and bomb sheltors are an option but once again if you get surrounded. Your kind of fucked.Rural area have low population densities but terrible support networks. Government services aret really useful in an outbreak based on the first few games though. The only threat outside the mansion were dogs and that took place in rural setting.The danger they fought outside of the mansion could have been negated by a car in the first game though. A bunker in a rural setting might be the safest place possible outside of the artic.Boats are good because most of the zombies cant swim but resident evil has giant aquatic monsters and flying monster as well.

10329584,0,t1_dcewnfa,gt When the Sega dreamcast was released Capcom was wanting to move the series to that due to the more powerful hardware RE and  were PS exclusives this is where current RE came into play it was going to be a spin off title to keep Playstation owners happy while the main series CV continued on the dreamcast.So ? They still didnt change CV or RE. CV was always meant to be a dreamcast title RE was always meant to be a lowbudget PS title. The only thing that changed is the renaming not the game.Therefore whats the point with Resident Evil  ?gt and yet its copying PTs visuals and atmosphere to enhance horror elements. and outlast is a survival horror like what Resident evil is supposed to be.PT is wildly different its a fucking demo a PoC that we still dont know if it would have worked as a full fledged game. Its based on random events created in a close space whereas RE only has first person view in common. RE has physical puzzles fighting enemies actual characters boss fights items inventory management everything that we already saw in a Resident Evil before. Whats the point with PT ? What even IS the point with Outlast ? Its basically a run away parkour game in an asylum whereas RE is restricted to basic movement. gt Thats exactly what capcom is doing now. Copying other more successful brands to get sales More successful Again people in this sub are really overestimating the consumer impact of PT and Outlast  Every main numbered RE since  is a  million seller RE and  are the REs that sold the most.  PT as a FREE demo passed one million and that was with the backing of Hideo Kojima and the whole gaming press heralding the demo as the revolution of horror. Outlast who enjoyed a very successful reputation still didnt pass the  million mark as a  game without taking into account the numerous sales. RE demo by itself a game where Capcom has remained mostly silent about without an overly excited gaming press has already garnered more than  million downloads. One million more than PT.Its time to wake up RE is not tapping a gold mine its taking a HUGE risk bringing first person horror to a wide consumer base where every metric shows that consumers at large would rather want a REstyled sequel. Nor outlast and even less PT is showing that there is a  million market in the first person horror genre. They had a decent success not a wild one. Lets stop grasping at every straw to prove that RE is copying or being inspired from another game. What weve already seen shows that RE comes from a solid base with solid ideas that simply isnt what we expect of an opportunistic game.,residentevil,dcewzq7,6,t5_2s0lb

Its not even red where its supposed to be chopped off. It looks like a mini dildo.. the only items in the EUCE worth looking at are the lithographs amp the art book.  If I had known that it wasnt the same as the US version I would have not wasted my money on it. I was really let down by it.

10482119,0,t1_dcvb910,You mean these selfish business practices are being done...for greed as was already stated in said rant?  We know why they are being done for money.  I dont think anyone is debating that.  Trying to tell people that this makes practical business sense or that other companies do the same thing achieves nothing buyers feel that they have bought an incomplete product a once complete product that was chopped up before selling to turn quick dollars.  So you are telling me that fans that wait in line the night before to buy something post user reviews almost immediately promote the product to all their friends or pay for the game months before it comes out dont deserve any additional respect from a company?  That they are the same as someone who wanders into the game section of Walmart weeks later and blind buys a game that they will play for a weekend and then never play againresell it used?  Only one of these consumers generates hype or excitement for a product.  Do I think that they deserve something special?  No i dont think Capcom owes them additional free stuff.  What I think they are owed is the complete game that was available when they paid their hardearned money for it.  If this was future DLC available three months from now you wouldnt hear this kind of complaining.  But we all know that this content was purposely removed for nothing other than greed.  I find that extremely hard to stomach as a long time customer of Capcom and game consumer in general.  ,residentevil,dcw98pk,2,t5_2s0lb

Having both characters simultaneously in the same year and yet vastly different in scope of character morality ethos etc. makes zero sense.I dont think its a redesign. Capcom is fairly consistent when doing so and would have made the Vendetta Chris the exact same as RE Redfield.

Evie could not extert her full influence on him aswell and so he could go against her.That being said there are interpretation holes more than plot holes in some occasions.I am still disappointed by the fact that theyll probably make Lucas a dlc enemy.,residentevil,dd1edcl,2,t5_2s0lb

10563883,0,t3_5r8iqk,TLDR  Dont heal save often and dont open the box at all. Pick up essential items only. The healing one is self explanatory.  Run on easy mode and save often if you have to. In a pinch you can collect Steroid shots and use those as one full heal if you feel the need. They do not count towards your overall heals. As far as the item box thats a little trickier. Youll have to manage your inventory well and forget nonessential items because you are limited on space. You cannot drop items like the crowsnakescorpion key and VHS tapes so pick your items wisely.  You will have to avoid opening the box at all on your own accord because you will be forced to open the box twice at least.  Once before the Happy Birthday room an one after. You can use your third open at any time but be warned after the Mia boat scene when you are playing as Ethan again you may want to use your last open there. I didnt realize this on my first play through and when I got to this point I had to run past everything without opening the box. All you truly need is the serum and thats already in your inventory.  If you do this without opening after the tanker and make it to Eveline let her kill you one time then choose manage inventory. It will allow you to choose from your stash without an open box penalty. Good luck!,residentevil,dd5jaio,1,t5_2s0lb

10586984,0,t3_5rjqai,Ive made some posts about Madhouse.  Good information here too. You dont need to buy the Scorpion Key.  You can just shimmy through the walls into the F Drawing Room to get into and out of that section of the house.   coins for the M Shotgun is a good deal though. You cant buy everything but you really dont need to.  The Steroids and Stabilizer are usually a given but nothing else is really that important.  Neither of the coins makes a big difference and the Magnum isnt really any better than the Albert R in most cases Id recommend getting the Magnum for an NG run however. The only important locked box is the  super bullets in the basement.  Together with the first  super bullets you make in the laundry room use the blue chems in the Pantry to melt the Neuro Round to get red chems and combine them with the gunpowder in the laundry room youll have an easy time of things.  The other chests are rather forgettable although getting the magnum rounds is very nice if youre going to use the magnum.Some other things to note the Model Shotgun is in the basement so if you skip buying the Scorpion Key you can still get the M Shotgun.  The Broken Handgun is in the Greenhouse so itll be a little while longer before you can get the M Handgun if you want it.A crawler spawns in the basement if you grab the  shotgun shells behind the chest.  I dont know why it triggers off of this and not something else but I did everything I could think of to get it to spawn and it never did spawn unless I picked up those shells.Make sure you shut doors behind you.  There are a few spots where a molded will spawn in another room and then come out to chase you  if the door is shut the molded gets sad and leaves.  Particularly notable for the Incinerator Room shut the door after the molded spawns wait for it to despawn and then shut the door behind you as you leave.  That particular molded will spawn inside the Incinerator Room as you walk into the corridor and if the doors shut it cant get to you.Flame grenades are a  shot kill on nests in the Old House.  I very often use my grenade launcher to deal with nests remember you can melt neuro rounds to get red chems to make flame rounds with   neuro round to make  flame rounds is a good deal or vice versa! and just use the burner on Marge  and Marge .,residentevil,dd7yski,3,t5_2s0lb

The helicopter that rescues Ethan at the end of the game is owned by the Umbrella Corps a mercenary group that are using Umbrellas former moniker as their official name. Umbrella Corps main purpose is to infiltrate locales quarantined from the outside world because of bioterrorist attacks and retrieve research data on B.O.W.s and viruses within each of these zones. As far as we know the Baker ranch house in Dulvey Louisiana is just one of these latest areas afflicted with a biohazard and the Corps have been monitoring the area since  so they can get their hands on Eveline a B.O.W. developed by Tentsu.The original Umbrella themselves have been long gone by now RE takes place in July  which places it thirteen years after Umbrella Japans collapse which marked the true end for Umbrella. Redfield is definitely not Chris Redfield the title of Not A Hero seems to insinuate that this is merely an agent working for Umbrella Corps who has stolen Chris Redfields identity for his own ends. gt but not all so Im not fully aware of the stories.Dont worry about it heh.

The scanner is a pain in the ass and the story is meh but other than that it has the best control scheme for a shooterlike RE way better than RE IMO. The setting in the ship is great and it has Raid Mode which I think its a pretty welcome change of pace to the Mercenaries as a bonus mode. Also Jill is cute.,residentevil,ddljhpa,2,t5_2s0lb
10719608,0,t1_ddlmosf,Well it is the first numbered game to have a subtitle since Nemesis...My main line of reasoning is that theyve turned toward a more down to earth ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances vibe with this one. And that doesnt seem to fit in with the last few comically overthetop action games. But it does harken back to a game like RE.For instance why is it that the two people tasked with escorting such a high risk subject as Eveline arent super tough buff karate masters that flip out windows and powerbomb bad guys? Isnt that what weve come to expect? Instead we get Mia with a skillset reminiscent of a young Jill Valentine  a believable level of capabilities for a member of a special tactics unit.,residentevil,ddlnch3,2,t5_2s0lb

10746042,0,t3_5tmpsy,I love RE but it was FAR too short and Ethan wasnt a great protagonist. My biggest gripe with RE is Ethan. He is dull and unresponsive to the terrors around him. He hardly has any dialog in the game and the dialog he does have is.... dull. I instantly liked Mia more when we began to play as her. She was more interesting than Ethan without a doubt.If the protagonist in RE was as likable as Leon.. then yeah Id probably like it more than .

10746300,0,t3_5tql4l,Theres a point in the game just before the last boss where you should use up ALL your best ammo except the magnum?

10753274,0,t1_ddp3hu8,Absolutely not. Then wed just have an Outlast clone and that would have been so boring. Weve had enough run and hide games. Resident Evil is about fighting back not being helpless and hiding in a locker every time a molded looks at you. It would have completely betrayed the series to get rid of combat.It also makes sense that theres not much tension left by the end. Why should there be? Youve seen all that Evie can throw at you and youve killed it. Now youre loaded to the gills and can take on anything. Its natural progression and is an extremely logical end point. Its why I laugh whenever people say  and  are too much action. Its just the next logical step for these characters. Chris Leon Ada and Sherry have faced BOWs multiple time before and are specifically trained to do just that. Why should the player be afraid when the character theyre posing as cannot possibly be afraid?,residentevil,ddp49ls,3,t5_2s0lb

If it was just flybys of interior and exterior environmentsit would seem par for the course as standard credit scroll background. I suppose i was over reachingbut the game was so great i wanted to sqeeze every tidbit of information out of it.

10939325,0,t1_de76q33,Nah no worries. But the reason it would be problematic is because it would contradict the scarcity of weapons initially and the intrigue of discovering and using new weapons. It would also partially detract from the reward of unlocking better weapons via various achievements. Also there would be virtually no narrative context for this. They could have implemented a postgame mode which uses a storesystem in the main game similar to Nightmare where killing enemies gives you money to buy weapons and upgrades. But that would be a replayability thing more than a playability thing as appears to be what you want.    Scarcity of ammo also kind of makes it pointless.

11167652,0,t1_dexu6iz, I dont know if Ive put more emphasis on women characters but when I do introduce them it is never as objects.  In some games they will be peripheral characters with ridiculous breast physics.  I avoid that sort of obvious eroticism.  I also dont like female characters who are submissive to male characters or to the situation theyre in.  I wont portray women in that way.  I write women characters who discover their interdependence as the game progresses or who already know they are independent but have that tested against a series of challenges. If I had to name the woman character I most disliked in my games it would be Rebecca Chambers.  Shes submissive shes not independent.  I didnt want to include her but the staff wanted that kind of character in the game for whatever reason.  Im sure it made sense to them.  And in Japan that character is pretty popular.Its doubly funny because SD Perry made Rebecca Chambers her author avatar and fans demanded Rebecca so much she got Resident Evil Zero. Still it might explain why she was absent from the franchise for a decade. Then again CLAIRE was absent for a decade and shes probably the nd most popular female in the series.,residentevil,dexub63,6,t5_2s0lb

He has some of Weskers genes but hes a fairly ordinary human being with a lot of training.gtAs a result of analysis we discovered Albert Weskers unique genetic makeup has a high probability of having been passed on to Jake Muller. If we can elucidate this specific property we can expect a breakthrough in current CVirus research.However further analysis of the tissue fragment we obtained has become impossible as it is infinitesimal. For further study we require Jake Mullers body fluids blood mucous and marrow. For security of this mission I think Mr. Simmons subordinate Ada Wong would be suitablegtRE  in general is the most absurd in regards to the series canon but it didnt have to be. Its like the writers just did not care at all.This seems like a silly criticism to me because they made a lot of effort to ensure everything in RE had some sort of justification or was explained in a file somewhere. There are a LOT of files to read. Everything from how the CVirus works to how Helena got locked in a room because nobody liked her so she couldnt warn the President about the attack is covered in the files.Aside from action movie nonsense like the catacombs RE has no real story logic problems. Woman goes to USA has sex with Wesker returns home to Edonia son grows up into asshole mercenary.Its not like RE where huge chunks of the plot either dont make sense or Capcom havent solved the gaping plot holes with DLC yet.

When Ethan showed up Zoe knew that her family would KIDNAP him so she went home to HELP without ANYONE seeing as she ALWAYS do. Also the reason behind Ethan NOT dying fast as the SHIP crew is because Eveline wants him and Mia to be her NEW parents WITHOUT using any type of mind control probably KILLING the Bakers after that being done. ,residentevil,dfkf8ps,0,t5_2s0lb

11545250,0,t3_5uorog,Having looked at wiki it describes Ethan as a regular civilian. It seems this may very well be coincidence or maybe just an easter egg.Ethan WintersVoiced by Todd Soley RE Hidenobu Kiuchi RE JapaneseEthan is the main protagonist of the game Resident Evil  Biohazard. Ethan is an ordinary American civilian who is looking for his missing wife Mia. Mia went missing over  years ago after she sent a video message to Ethan talking about how much she was looking forward to coming home. Ethan then suddenly receives a disturbing video message and an email from Mia so he tells an unknown friend that he is heading out to search for her in Dulvey Louisiana. This leads him to a derelict plantation mansion that also happens to be the home of the deranged Baker family who have been driven insane due to being infected with the EVirus from Eveline.After viewing a tape he finds regarding a camera crew being attacked in the same house he soon finds his wife in a hidden area lying in a cell but Mia acts peculiar as they look for a way out and disappears. She then attacks Ethan with a kitchen knife. The ensuing chaos leads to Mia throwing Ethan through a wall. However he manages to kill her using an ax and pistol. Eventually she gets up corners Ethan and pins him to the wall by his hand with a screwdriver then cuts off Ethans pinned hand. Ethan knocks Mia out and then suddenly a man attacks Ethan and knocks him out taking both Ethan and Mia back inside the house. Ethans severed hand is attached back on by a woman named Zoe the only sane member of the Baker family and then later Ethan manages to become untied at the dinner table due to a police officer ringing a telephone which distracted the Bakers who were planning to torture him for refusing to eat with them. Ethan manages to fully mend his hand but learns that the Bakers cannot be killed very easily.Mia as it turns out is also infected by Eveline as is Zoe and therefore not dead. Although Mia and Zoe have to find a way to escape as well. However Zoe explains that they need to be cured first using a serum as they cannot leave until this is fulfilled. Ethan also encounters other abnormal monsters created by Eveline such as the creatures called The Molded. But escaping the premises is made extremely difficult as the Bakers relentlessly pursue him and Ethan has to protect himself using whatever means he can find so he can ultimately overcome each family member.Ethan attempts to get in contact with a military group for his rescue while learning more about Eveline as an ESeries Bioweapon. After he is assisted by the military group via chopper and seemingly puts a stop to Eveline he is rescued by a man named Redfield alongside his wife who is working with the newly reformed Umbrella Corporation whose intentions remain unclear.,residentevil,dg4nmql,1,t5_2s0lb

And I really hate his and Mary Elizabeths attitude on the older game and how Mary Elizabeth was talking crap about Donna Burke.Downpour might be a good game but his attitude how he handled backlash from the failure of the HD Collection and his attempts to insert his storyBook of Memories  as the cause and lore of other games really is really unprofessional.For the HD collection  He acts like he is one of the top surpervisorsworkers on the project.

11800661,0,t3_68aj9p,I honestly think its too derivative to be considered a Modern Classic. Its a fantastic game though and itll be remembered as one of the series strongest titles.RE and RE are the two Id called classics. RE popularised an entire genre and essentially coined the term survival horror for most people. Itd be hard to argue that it wasnt incredibly impactful. RE basically redesigned the genre by taking it in a more actionheavy direction. If you pick up any thirdperson action game today theres something that RE did first. It may be starting to show some age but the game is undoubtedly a classic that was undeniably groundbreaking. RE feels like a million other horror games but done to a very high level of quality. This isnt a bad thing  they took what worked from other FPS horror games and polished it to hell. RE is one of my favourites in the series but I dont think its going to be anywhere near as remembered or impactful on the industry as  or . ,residentevil,dgxn9ar,4,t5_2s0lb
