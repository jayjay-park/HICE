688403,0,t1_cgiia8t,Thats interesting. I do plan on seeing some of the main attractions but because I am anticipating it being peak season in regards to tourists Im thinking we will want to focus on back country and backpacking. We might just end up doing a drivethrough for the Tetons if anything in the interest of time. EDIT If we get to a campground early enough to snag a spot. Is it safe to leave and go exploring? Or do we have to stay at the spot all day to prevent it getting poached on?,yellowstone,cgiiu45,1,t5_2t545

1613229,0,t3_2cq276,My friend just went there with a broken finger and with a healing rib fracture. He broke his finger after he shut the door on it when trying to pack his car up for the trip and the rib fracture was from not wearing his seatbelt correctly in a car accident a few weeks back.He roughed it in a tent for a few days but complained how laying on the ground was hurting too much and ended up buying an aerobed. He didnt get to hike much because he tried hiking grizzly lake and it hurt too much after a little while. But he was able to walk around on flat surfaces. He says to not push yourself past your limit. Do what you think is best for you. ,yellowstone,cjiij01,1,t5_2t545

4171720,0,t1_crukvik,I really enjoyed the short walk out to the falls and it was great to be away from the crowds and boardwalks for some time. Just beyond the falls there are thermals including a geyser in a lake and mud pots. They are just a short walk down what I took to be an official trail when I was there. I did not know about the view of Grand Prismatic and did not make it up any hills to see that.  ,yellowstone,crvs7s5,1,t5_2t545

4485871,0,t3_3ciho6,There are a LOT of rivers in Yellowstone and some of the most rewarding and accessible stretches are on Slough Creek the Madison the Gibbon the Yellowstone and the Firehole.  They all require a unique set of considerations so do plenty of reading based on whenwhere you will be in the park.If you simply want your best chance at catching some fish in Yellowstone to cross it off your bucket list youd be hard pressed to find a more anglerfriendly bit of water than the Gardiner River and surrounding creeks at the Indian River campground area.That being said your ability to catch fish on any one stretch of water in the park is going to be highly dependent on seasons hatches weather etc.  So here are some resources that will help you immensely in finding other waters and knowing when and how to fish themAngling in YellowstoneSeasonal ConsiderationsPopular RiversThe Ultimate Searchable Guide to Fishing in YellowstoneIts also good to keep in mind that in Yellowstone the best place to catch fish does not always equate to the best place to fish.

Im not sure if thats going to be the case this summer because it fo sho aint the case now haha.That said this is one of the biggest rooms Ive been in inside the park and the layout lets you customize your bed and furniture setups pretty well.

7391750,0,t1_d2i7zei,Well with the exception of flying into Orlando pretty much everywhere you fly is going to be expensive. The only reason it isnt to MCO is because everyone and their mama flies there. When we my wife and I go to Yellowstone we drive. Its  miles for us and take  days to get there and back but we literally save almost  by not buying tickets and having to rent a car. We also dont have to put up with the stupidity of the security BS at the airports and deal with delayed flights idiotic travelers lost luggage paying for luggage etc. ,yellowstone,d2ie4gx,3,t5_2t545

7889798,0,t3_4ncwba,Cabins sell out long in advance.  If you want to stay in park yout need to plan early.   That said you might be able to camp if they have any grounds that are not available to reserve in advance.    I havent camped there before but I am assuming they dont do advanced reservation for all of their locations.You could also try staying just outside the park which might be better than the . hours of driving each way each day.   Youll likely do alot of driving in the park itself so you should bear that in mind.,yellowstone,d42vx4v,2,t5_2t545
7987421,0,t1_d4d4krd,Shoshone Geyser basin is awesome!!! I nd Bones. Theres also a spot you can hop in the river where a hot spring flows in and its nice and warm! Itd be about  miles rt. You can ride a bike down an old road thats now closed from Kepler Cascades to Lone Star Geyser about  miles one way. Id also add Union Falls as another hike. Its about . miles rt so itll take mostall of your day. You could also hike Avalanche Peak and Mt Washburn. If you did both it would take up a good portion of the day. If you do Washburn hike it from the southern trail the northern trail is a boring access road.The hike to Hellroaring Creek and back would be good too.Oh and can I say that September is my favorite month in the park! Its the perfect time of year IMO.,yellowstone,d4dv1wp,2,t5_2t545
8328770,0,t1_d5ilmjk,Yeah I was thinking of bringing a cooler on the plane ride. I figured with this much driving cold drinks and sandwiches are a definite must. Might actually stop by some of the bigger name grocery stores in Cody to stock up before getting to our place for the night on Friday.Definitely not looking to do any crazy hikes so far Grand Canyon is a definite see for us. I was thinking the first day head out to Canyon VillageHayden Valley area super early at AM to try and avoid as much buffalo traffic. Then try and make the drive up to Mount Washburn and then Roosevelt. Parents like the whole tourist thing so I booked the Cookout and Wagon Ride for dinner at Roosevelt. I figure that would take up an entire day.I will be doing most of the driving and was actually wondering how it is driving through the park at night? Are there any spots I can stop at to check out that are relatively safe? ,yellowstone,d5ingmm,1,t5_2t545
8692609,0,t3_4z0aqo,You are in far more danger driving to a trailhead than you ever will be from animals.  Dont worry about wolves at all they do not attack people unless someones been feeding them.  As for cats Ive lived here for  years and only seen tracks. They are rare. Respect grizzlies but dont let their existence prevent you from enjoying a hike.  Bison are far more common and much more aggressive than bears.  Assuming they can cover dozens of yards in a few seconds always give them a wide berth.Hiking in a group of  or more and carry bear spray but as long as youre not solo or in a pair your chance of being attacked by a predator is nill.,yellowstone,d6s7eix,2,t5_2t545

From the coach you can look out the windows talk to your fellow travelers take pictures etc all while not freezing. Cross country skiing is a good option as well if you are up for that.

10540550,0,t1_dd2tujr,For my drug test I was told to take one before I came out and have the place mail it to them.  Otherwise youll probably be doing it at one of the clinics in the park. I honestly dont know how or when they do background checks but I imagine that they dont run background checks on everyone.  They hire tons of seasonal employees every year and HR is pretty small.  And I can pretty much guarantee that your manager isnt going to be doing any background checks inpark Internet is horrible and managers are busy .

11252909,0,t1_df7hmwl,Old Faithful is a long way from anywhere. Bozeman is the closest city and its  miles from Old Faithful if you go via West Yellowstone and then  North.  has been my best time if there arent bison jams in the park. Traffic out is usually better than traffic into the park but conditions vary. Jackson is  miles to the south takes about the same time because a lot more of the driving is in the parks. I love Jackson but it doesnt have a Target which is my standard for true civilization. The closest town is West Yellowstone  miles and  minutes to an hour depending on the number of bison standing in the damn road. You have to make your case to the housing manager. Talk about how you are a responsible couple and would prefer quieter accommodations.,yellowstone,df7i14e,1,t5_2t545
