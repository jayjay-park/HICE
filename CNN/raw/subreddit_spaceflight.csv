With our design the first and second stages are powered by the same engines reducing weight and complexity explained Steve Johnston director Advanced Space Exploration.That is a very clever approach!

Neither have had actual test flights yet and SpaceX has had a pretty good track record with their falcon s.Falcon Heavy will probably fly but it will also probably not be any cheaper than SLS to launch the same amount of payload since you need x as many flights to bring up the same mass and all of those have to be fully expendable launches because FH cant bring up very much payload with reuse. The only direct SLS competitor being developed by anyone is BFR and its likely going to be at least as expensive as SLS unless they can make reusability work and thats the hard part.gtSpaceX has also tried twice as a side mission to cargo launches and it has come very close. I believe theyre soon going to attempt it on land and I think theyll only get better.Close but still not succeeded. And even landing it isnt enough they have to prove that the stages can be inspected refurbished and reflown cheaply. gtHow would it not be cheaper? Even if they had to replace andor refurbish half the rocket it would still be cheaper than starting from scratch.Labor. The cost of the rocket itself in terms of physical components really isnt that much most of the cost of building it is paying the employees. If they have to spend twice as much time working on refurbishing each stage compared to manufacturing them that means the stage costs about twice as much to fly even if theyre spending less on materials and machining and whatever. And it has to be a lot cheaper not just a couple percent to justify the reduction in payload capacitygtBack to the first thing why would the SLS be more likely to work?And if the SLS is more expensive as you said wouldnt it be at greater risk of being not economical? And where are you pulling the  from?SLS isnt reliant on any new technologies or techniques its an incremental adaptation of half century old designs. SLS also doesnt have to be economical because its government run. If it costs more theyll just pay for it. If SpaceX or BO or someone fails at making a rocket cheap enough to be profitable theyd just give up because theres no money in it.The  is pulled out of my ass because its hard to estimate.

My point with voyager is that it was a long time ago and the technology has improved since then and really the data being sent back to earth is tiny.

This was so they could build it for peanuts and rapidly. I hope this was the cause of the failure so they can just make their own components in the future and not rely on older components. They will have to redesign everything from the ground up anyways for the new launchpad. That takes a lot of time so expect that they launch from their two other launch sites way before they complete this one.

9422738,0,t1_d99v5ua,So based off of your animation I drew the following. This isnt producing torque because its a flywheel it would if you mounted it on the axis of rotation but it isnt. This is producing torque through inertia of the magnets on the flywheel. I drew the following to describe what Im talking about I described it in four stages While the Flywheel Magnets Magnets A are within the wall magnets Magnets B the total force on the blocks is . At the closest distance D the force of the magnets is pushing the block toward the center of the flywheel  relieving tension from the string holding the blocks to the wheel and allowing them to push against the wheel. The magnetic force replaces a good amount of centripetal force. so Fm  Fcentripetal  Fcentrifugal  The magnetic force of B to A is suddenly removed. Now until the line is taught Fcentrifugal pulling the block outward. This happens quickly because the magnets are suddenly removed so there is a force F applied to the block over a short period of time t. This is an impulse that is pulling away from the flywheel in the direction of the blocks movement. This movement from the blocks initial position P to its secondary position P is very quick. The B magnets are slowly returned to the original distance D starting at a further distance D. At D the magnetic force is lower than at D so the magnetic force only reduces the necessary centripetal force slightly thus reducing the tension on the string and pushing the block toward the flywheel. Over a period of time t the block is moved from P back to P as the distance of the opposing magnets B and A goes from D to D. This time t is much longer than t and the impulse is lower  The forces are conserved its the impulse that changes.  If this was floating in space the wheel would not move. The impulse of the block being thrown outward would be cancelled by the impulse on the string pulling it in. While you have it on a balance like this some of the impulse is being put into torque... as long as the gap in B magnets is in a direction that the bar can turn clockwise or counterclockwise. When the gap is upward the best youd see is a wobble upward and downward.  If you want to test this secure the wheel at its axis on the middle of a bar. Hang the bar by the ends by two strings from the ceiling. Wheel is in middle Strings are on ends. If you slowly increase the rpm you should be able to get the wheel to oscillate back and forth. That would show its conserving momentum within itself.  This is the effect of impulse and torque. Force is still conserved in the system.  ,spaceflight,d9aeax8,1,t5_2qsj9

Having had to do the staging efficiencycost calcs by hand Im still a proponent of air launch over SSTO for manned systems. For unmanned systems Falcon is a perfect mix of fly back booster and staged launch vehicle. Parachute landing is preferable to retro rocket landing but still results in high g loads at reentry.

If cislunar or circumMars orbital industries can be set up theres a lot to be said for moving infrastructure into orbit instead of bringing raw materials down here. Obviously itll be critical to get some of that raw material down here to finance all this but once the first asteroid comes back with trillions of dollars of platinum theres a lot more incentive to build the infrastructure up there to go get more. Or for that matter to do something with the leftover nickeliron thats not worth bringing back to Earth.
