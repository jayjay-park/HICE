341224,0,t3_1xwded,The difficulty with a reboot is that it cant succeed by being merely a good movie.  It has to be better than a classic and thats hard to do.  ,SciFiScroll,cfg4yr9,1,t5_2r8hj
857884,0,t1_ch1n3az,Of course. Its just hard not to make that mental leap. I mean that movie basically started the whole Ancient Aliens Craze in America. Eric Von Daneken wrote Chariots of the Gods which mostly languished in obscurity until Stargate came along and made everyone fall in love with the idea. Also I was in sixth grade when the movie came out. It was the coolest thing since Jurrasic Park.,SciFiScroll,ch1sok5,1,t5_2r8hj

4353438,0,t1_csawnv7,SGU abandoned everything that made SG and to a lesser extent Atlantis great.The quirky humor was entirely gone in SGU replaced with a sort of grim humorless BSGesque fatalism.The quirky nature of SG was part of what made it great  the characters came across like dramatized versions of real people.,SciFiScroll,csgd5jt,3,t5_2r8hj

5647253,0,t1_cwx2i4t,The whole land was frozen so less need of repair from land expanding and contracting from freeze thaw cycles.  They were only there for  years and the train is the only one running on the track.  Each section of track only gets used once per year since it is a one year trip around.  I find this way more believable than anything in the Fallout games where electronics still work  years aftet a nuclear war.  Want something hard to believe ?  Try starting any car after it sits unused for  months or a year.  The battery is toast never to be able to hold a charge again but week after week people are driving around on The Walking Dead.  That is only the beginning since the gasoline would be crap after a while also.,SciFiScroll,cwx3hj5,2,t5_2r8hj

6758247,0,t1_d0hzoc2,I thought it was ok in the beginning. It just sort of drags and feels flat. I dont have a problem with the fact that we dont see anything of the aliens themselves. I guess I just do not feel like the story moves much and the chracters are not engaging. I am hoping that the last two episodes maybe correct that. I watch it but find myself tuning out quickly. Its not good when you have to remind yourself to pay attention. Please feel free to give it a watch. Its not too many episodes all together and others may really enjoy it. This is all my opinion and only applies to me. ,SciFiScroll,d0icxz5,1,t5_2r8hj

8480560,0,t3_4vuk8w,I dont tune in to anything anymore because I can watch it online through my subscribers online service but I dont think theyre counting delayed views or whatever the term is. Going back is impossible after you realize how much time is wasted with crap that interrupts your viewing experience so Im interested in what makes the difference to those viewers who still tune in.My guess is that the people who still put up with commercials arent tech savvy enough to realize they dont have to the same people who find the bases of most sci fi stories confusing how my grandparents describe the matrix and battlestar galactica or weird how my roommate with an English degree describes dr who.

The general storyline parallels the books but doesnt mirror them. The characters dont match what I imagined from having read the books first but thats okay. Holden kind of annoys me actually. Miller is outstanding though. Overall its the show I look forward to most every week.,SciFiScroll,depjy9q,1,t5_2r8hj
