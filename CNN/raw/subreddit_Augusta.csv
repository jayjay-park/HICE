41102,0,t3_1ukm2m,Riding downtown this homeless man was walking in the middle of the street holding up traffic. People would go around when they got a chance. But he had traffic back good ways. Another time downtown near the green jacket stadium I was riding threw the mud trail near the river around  am. And there was a lady kneeling in the trees with very few clothes on. Looking like she was taking a dump. Made me lolfloor it. ,Augusta,cej3zfz,5,t5_2repf

1057127,0,t3_266fon,I feel like the posts so far are glossing over or downplaying that downtown amp olde town are two of the highest violent crime rate areas in Augusta Just a couple weeks ago someone was shot at rd amp broad not sure how severe or if they died and the shooting at First Friday downtown a couple years ago is more than enough for me to suggest you look elsewhere North Augusta and the National Hills neighborhood come to mind as safer alternatives that have good access to downtown. Those are just the two crimes that popped into my head let alone the dozens of other violent crimes that happen in the downtownolde town areas  how about the one with the couple was was badly beaten with a baseball bat on the river walk last year? I know some folks in law enforcement and its alarming how frequent these types of crimes happen. If youre a single male who is used to living in areas that you need to watch your surroundings youll probably be fine any other situation I would highly recommend you check out North Augusta and National Hills Augusta off Washington Road near Augusta National  you could easily bike from either of those places to downtown. Id also add that schools in the Augusta proper area arent terrific there are a few great ones but many more not as great ones but it doesnt sound like thats a current concern for you.Good luck! Let me know if you have any further questions glad to share my experiences or any info I can.,Augusta,chog7gj,4,t5_2repf

3483266,0,t1_cppa85f,The direction that we want to go that separates us from the existing events listing and calendars is to have a curated list of food and drink specials as well as nightly events and oneoff entertainment opportunities. As it is you cant easily get to the events listings on Augusta.com without going directly to events.augusta.com. Also while their listings are certainly there the searchability of them is nil.Facebook exists but the reach isnt always the best and the information often is not as high a quality as you might like. Facebook is definitely useful but I think the utilization of it thus far has been a little inconsistent and maybe a little frustrating for some users. If I type in stillwater taproom events to Google I should ideally get a search page with has a link to stillwater and a few upcoming events in the text below the link. Also when I get to the page about stillwater a facebook page a google plus page a business website etc I should get some information about stillwater.From our perspectives these pieces of information are spread across several different resources which is cumbersome for visitors to access as well as venues and artists to maintain. Were working on consolidating that information so you can quickly determine where you want to go and what you want to see base off of venuerestaurant descriptions drinks specials nightly events and oneoff entertainment opportunities.Thats hopefully what sets us apart from the rest of the crowd.,Augusta,cppbfz1,1,t5_2repf

10839490,0,t1_ddv619s,With regards to their scams most of them are smart enough not to try and scam people in the area. Local police know about them and most residents know what to look for. Their victim of choice are elderly people who usually have a big heart. I recently moved into the Lakemont area and had a couple of guys try to scam me that were very clearly Irish Travellers. They wanted to repave my driveway and while their equipment looked legit I wasnt born yesterday. When they repave they will put the absolute thinnest layer of asphalt possible and try to pull it off as a good job. Will crack and come apart one week later. Ive heard similar stories about their paint jobs where they will use watereddown paint that washes off after the first rain. I was up to this guys bullshit but he was so persistent trying to sell me on it another give away. Telling me how he had just got done doing another job and they had some left over that he had to get rid of. Despite my insistence that my driveway was fine he kept on about it to the point where I had to ask him to leave and he started getting confrontational. I was really close to saying something about him being an Irish Traveller but I knew if I pissed him off enough there is a good possibility they would come by my place and vandalize it. They are absolute human scum and Im happy they are being indicted by the Feds. ,Augusta,ddy0lva,3,t5_2repf
