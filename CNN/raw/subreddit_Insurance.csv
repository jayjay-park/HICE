537509,0,t1_cg1bjj2,First off awesome post! And thank you....gt  their shop wrote your estimate right?Sorry Not  sure what you mean by this. Geicos quote is from their adjuster that works in a toyota body shopor this is where my appointment was atleast. As for the labor rates is their no merit in the fact that a more expensive car will require a more expensive repair? I understand the average rate and they definitely were not referring to that I asked about  times. Now even if those were the labor rates shouldnt reasonable be taking the quality of the vehicle into account? If my car costs x more than the average car that goes though body shops wouldnt it be reasonable for the cost of repairs to be the same.Now the biggest discrepancy is for the labor hours for the same jobs. See here....So even if they use the average market rates how can they argue against the repair time of my shop? Also I cant find any law referring to being payed without getting the repairs done. But from what everyone has told me at ca DOI I have this right. Now am incorrect in saying that I am entitled to the reimbursement of the damages that were done to my car?

I do not know what they mean by that. Does this mean the Manufacturers Authorized Repair Shops are the only Licensed Repair Facility that are authorized to maintain the car under policy or could Jiffy Lube be considered one?Heres a couple of things that I do see An overheated thermostat would likely be covered. They do list Contamination of Fluids but typically that is related to things like dirt and leaves not an exploding thermostat. This is where an appeals section for the insurance company would need to review the definition of Contamination of Fluids to determine if Exploding Thermostat Parts fits that definition. The argument should be that the Exploding Thermostat caused additional damage to the covered vehicle that could not be foreseen by the policyholder you and being that you kept the car well maintained by a licensed repair facility the policy should pay out on your claim to return the car to its original well maintained state. ,Insurance,cjja6hj,1,t5_2qs6s

1818843,0,t1_ck8axxw,First thing to know is a BuySell is a legal documentagreement. Life insurance or disability is just a means to fund it. If two people own a  business  its unlikely if one of them passes away the other guy just has  lying around to buy the other guys family out assuming the deceased family actually agrees k is what its worth unlikely. So we provide the funding that accompanies the legal agreement so that you dont end up in quagmire of legal battles with the deceaseds family over control andor value of the business. A BS provides a clean legally binding split. The living business partner gets the company and the deceased family gets the value of the deceaseds portion in cash.The policy amount is based on the value of the business. In our earlier example you would do a  policy on each. We generally do a CrossPurchase where Owner A owns the policy on Owner Bs life and viceversa. Term or permanent is up to the clients just depends on the situation and how much they are able to fund. You can sell a term but I would make sure the policy is convertible. A OneSided BS is a crosspurchase but only one policy being purchased. The business owner Owner A who wants to retain the business buys a policy on the Owner B who just wants the value of his portion in cash for his family at death. At the time of Owner Bs death Owner A uses the proceeds to buy Owner Bs portion of the business for an agreed upon amount. Theres no need to buy a policy on the life of the owner who wants to retain the business for himself or his family because they arent selling. This works well for a younger guy wanting to buy out an older guy. Young Guy buys an insurance policy for the value of the older guys ownership. Young guy funds it and when older guy passes away he uses the death benefit proceeds to pay off the older guys family. ,Insurance,ck8csur,3,t5_2qs6s

2085013,0,t3_2iq7oa,Oregon has interesting liability laws.  If youre more than  you cant recover on the other partys insurance at all.If youre backing up youre likely going to be found at fault.  Even if hes speedingnot looking he still has control of the roadway and rightofway.  Because you didnt see him you cant establish his actions.Insurance claims within the same company have to be treated equally and the same as if they were with different companies.  As the insured his adjuster is not going to assign him any liability they have to weigh his word over yours.  Your adjuster may be able to assign him some liability but its going to be minimal and in a word versus word parking lot accident given the state liability laws its not pursuable.  Additionally the  mph speed limit is not enforceable in a parking lot.  Its more whether his speed was appropriate in the circumstances but again his position trumps you backing out.So the unfavorable outcome is not because of a Progressive v. Progressive claim but because you hold the majority of liability in a state that bars recovery for those with the majority of liability.  You may be able to raise enough of a stink to get your deductible back if you have collision coverage but ,Insurance,cl4un3e,2,t5_2qs6s

You DO NOT need a lawyer here but should consider calling an insurance agent to get real advice. Youre buying a brand new car  no need for towing coverage unless youre worried about worst case having to shell out  for a random tow but I suspect Toyota covers that anyway.Im assuming the policy is   meaning  per person  per all injury and  for any damage to property. Thats enough for someone who doesnt own a home and has no assets to protect. Thats as high as about  of all personal auto policies.  of all accidents are less than this amount but there is value in going with higher liability limits because its usually not all that much more. is a high deductible for a new car  thats what you pay out if you hit something. Its what you have to pay for your vehicle before any insurance money. Again  your vehicle only. Liability people you injure or property you damage does not come with a deductible except for the low end crappy Allstate policies.  You need car rental  mind the rate  these days anything less than  per day is too little. If you have health insurance the k isnt all that useful because the health policy would cover but its usually a cheap cost. Id recommend carrying k only  that would cover ambulance expenses. As for your parents. Youre only  but an adult. Do you live with them? If so why wouldnt you be on their policy? Most personal policies are intended for the household.

3535091,0,t3_30qj8i,Primary Answer  There is nothing you can do to better qualify yourself for life insurance.  The phrase It is what it is unfortunately fits here.  You will get quoted a standard rate from an agent.  You will then answer questions on your medical history and give blood and urine.  An underwriter will inevitably request for your medical records from your doctor.  Based on those records and the results of your medical exam they will make a decision.  You cannot hide anything from a company who may have to pay out  figures upon your death.  I recommend just trying to get the process done with a company and if they eventually turn you down try again with another company.Secondary answer  Its something.  And anything is is better than nothing if the life insurance is a complete no go.  ,Insurance,cpv82d8,2,t5_2qs6s

Legally they can not take money from you if they are not insuring you. If both companies were billed that could mean that you were billed twice. I would bring out the claims and bills you had at the team and see if everything was correct. Check the policy and see what your deductible inpatient fees and out of pocket are.

As less claims are paid out insurers will want to decrease their prices in order to stay competitive however the rate approval process would be slow since State Insurance Departments would only incrementally accept rate decreases.  Also some insurers are more risk averse and would prefer slowly losing business than risk being underreserved.In the long term  Revenue would decrease and profit would return to normal.  Premium is revenue for an insurer and since their customers represent a smaller risk the premium per policyholder would decrease.

Your description of coverage and payouts was exactly my understanding.  k is a lot to lose for something I truly feel I have no fault in.  After this I am seriously considering a dashcam.  Under different circumstances I could accept  liability.  Had there been no cars in the intersection blocking my view of the other driver approaching his stop sign I could agree that I should have seen him.  It was a  MPH road and it did not feel like I was going any faster than that.  If anything it may have been slower.  I was about  car lengths from where his car appeared.  I was watching the road in front of me and I literally watched his car while reacting emerge from between those two cars on my left side and continue traveling across the intersection right before my eyes.  He has gone on record stating that he increased his acceleration to try to avoid the impact which resulted in me hitting him where I hit him.  Under these circumstances I cant think of anything I couldve done differently other than getting xray vision.  Had he not accelerated and I hit his mid section or front side what stand would his insurance take then?  Unfortunately I didnt look for skid marks nor did I see any but I think the damages to my car can somewhat attest to my slowing down.  My damages where all cosmetic broken bumper grill headlights.  No frame or engine damage.  Regarding his car spinning I dont think it takes much impact for that just hit the right spot.Edit  I understand you were just posing random questions I just felt there was enough presented to show that I had no fault.  Hopefully with the arbitration they can see it that way.,Insurance,crs3rqo,1,t5_2qs6s

Ill look at submissions in these categories and determine a few key things including but not limited to. Whether the submission meets the states eligibility rules. Whether the submission meets my companys eligibility rules which may be more or less strict than the states. Whether the information in the application is complete and accurate. Whether everything has been classified correctly on the policyDuring the policy term Ill also review and changes endorsements made to policies. Many of these are automatically issued by our system after a series of audits are performed. If the computer determines that the changes are not significant and dont require a human set of eyes to determine acceptability itll just issue the endorsement as requested. Otherwise an underwriter will take a look at it and go through the steps above. Same thing at the end of the policy period  if the system determines that the policy needs a human set of eyes looking at it if there have been certain types of claims if someone on the policy has passed away during the term if it automatically determines that the policy is now ineligible etc. then an underwriter will review it and go through the steps above either allowing the policy to renew or issuing a nonrenewal. Aside from that you learn your forms inside and out and will take calls and answer emails from the agents that you work with at least in a company like mine which uses independent agents. Often times theyre getting you information that you requested or are bouncing questions off you regarding eligibility and acceptability. These agents typically write with multiple different carriers and it isnt always reasonable to expect them to you know your underwriting rules guidelines etc. as well as your form language inside and out like you the underwriter will. Certain submissions also require underwriting approval before even being submitted with coverage bound guaranteed.

The automatic reactive assumption is made that OEM parts are inherently superior which is not true. The auto insurance industry as a standard makes it a goal to only use CAPA and NSF certified nonOEM parts and this means that they have to meet or exceed OEM standards. In addition the vast majority of OEM parts are not manufactured by the vehicle manufacturer. They sublet the work to other companies which put a stamp on the part and they sell it at markup through the dealer repair network. So OEM vs nonOEM should only give someone pause if the OEM part source is questionable.

Often times companies use a service or in house program to find a valuation and it will take into account differences in mileage with an acceptable range. auto insurances pitchout special endorsements will pay in actual cash value which is market price essentially.

4672210,0,t1_ctjgq2s,If you go into underwriting youre going to have a claim.  Over a long enough time its a matter of when instead of a matter of if.  Granted there are exceptions to the rule but everybodys been dinged and a lot of people have seen a limit loss.First understand that if there werent claims we wouldnt need insurance so there will be claims.  The company shouldnt hold you responsible barring certain circumstances.  Insurance companies grant underwriters authority based on their level of expertise in the industry and those boundaries are there to ensure that you cannot write a risk thats going to jeopardize the company.  When I was talking about Underwriting Managers signing off on more risky accounts this is what I was referring to.  That manager is in place to ensure that youve contemplated all of the risks.  Regardless of how careful you are sometimes youre bound to get dinged.I once heard Jamie Luce CUO of Liberty Mutual and nice guy to boot  no I do not work for Liberty talk about this exact thing.  He broke it down into two parts.  The first thing he mentioned is that one claim assuming youre operating within your authority is not going to sink the company.  This article states that Libertys revenues for Q  were . billion.  Billion with a B.  Even if you were granted authority up to M say you wrote casualty umbrellas and you had a limit loss youd still only ding liberty by onetenth of one percent of their revenue for a quarter.  You alone cannot sink the ship.He then went on to give us this little anecdote.  Assuming you had a limit loss would you have underwritten the account the same way?  Basically did you do your job?  Did you contemplate the risks or did you overlook a major underwriting consideration?

4704612,0,t3_3f951y,I think the most important piece of information would be a license plate number. You could file a claim with your insurance company and have them repair your vehicle assuming you have Collision coverage meanwhile they would run the license plate for owner info and a Carrier Discovery search Theyd be able to find out who the insurance carrier is of the vehicle assuming they were insured. They would then attempt to subrogate basically try to recoup any payments made on this loss including possibly your deductible.Now regarding if the person who hit you is uninsured or if your insurance company is unable to locate the perpetrator. You would first have to see if you have UMPD Uninsured Motorist  Property Damage. Some states do not offer UMPD only UMBI Bodily Injury but then some states that do offer UMPD need claimant information for you to be able to use the UMPD coverage. Like in the state of North Carolina if youre involved in a Hit amp Run and you have UMPD you would not be able to use it unless youthey knew the identity of the driver you hit you. States like West Virginia they dont need claimant info for the coverage to be extended to you.,Insurance,ctnjydt,2,t5_2qs6s

What is happening is that the neighbors insurance company has probably informed them that they probably will not be able to subrogate against the company that insured the original burning home because there is a criminal act that caused their fire.  Therefore the neighbor will need to use their own policy to repair their home and they will be outofpocket for their deductible whatever that is.If that neighbor is claiming that they will incur any expenses out of pocket other than their deductiblewhatever that may be than they are being dishonest with their gofundme.com campaignand that happens a LOT on gofundme.com I hate that site,Insurance,ctuxje1,7,t5_2qs6s

If youre so inclined you could offer to go to their office to pick up the check in person that day  just to save them the cost of the stamp because youre such a generous person.

For example its got extensive hail damage or somebody keyed the whole car and that was enough to total it. The vehicle has high sentimental value and youre willing to possibly have to deal with a huge amount of expenses  frustrations  headaches time commitments to keep it. You already have a buyer linedup and preferably more than one who is willing to pay you more for the salvage than the insurer wants to deduct from your settlement for you to keep it.As the others have stated certain states dont want these cars on the road so they make it a huge hassle to get the car retitled. You may wait months for an appointment. Something that has nothing to do with the theftaccident damage can cause the car to flunk the inspection your brake pads are too thin the horn doesnt work the drivers window wont roll down etc.. come back in six weeks!. I once saw a car flunk a Connecticut inspection where you were required to bring the car to the inspection on a flatbed because you were not allowed to drive it on public roads until it passed inspection before it was off the truck.

Dont bother taking cash from them. That never works out right. Your damages are likely way more than what they can pay. People vastly underestimate how much it costs to properly repair a car. A smashed in door could easily be  or  thousand. Most people arent easily able to part with that kind of money. Also the initial estimate of damages could go up.  Most likely you will need to call your insurance file a claim and have them pay for it and let them worry about collecting the money from the person who hit you. ,Insurance,cz9693e,3,t5_2qs6s

They are ideal but they wont take all types of risks. When there are profitable risks that standard markets arent interested in excess and surplus lines brokers step in to offer coverage at higher premiums and typically without all the nice side benefits.

Their rate may very well skyrocket but they dont have to remove you from their policy for one accident. However it is their insurance policy so they can do whatever they want with it. Most insurance companies do have a limit on how many accidents you can have before they give you the boot but its usually more than one accident per policy.

6432328,0,t3_43rnhq,WOTOk as somebody who has handled streetlevel litigation and sat through a bunch of sometimes hilarious trials this is how I read between the lines on your storygt I cant believe that the release cant be enforced. I thought they were bullet proof.The question of whether the release iswas valid is a legal question for a court. There are assorted reasons why a release may or may not be valid. For example if this person was not capable of entering into a legally binding contract at the time it was signed because they were underage or drunkhigh or somebody else had been appointed to handle their affairs because they were mentally ill as just a few examples then they could sign stuff all day long but it might be adjudicated to not be legally binding. So youll have to let the lawyers sort that out.gt So Ive been served lawsuit papers which ask for an astronomically high amount of money in damage well above my policy... and any money I may conceivably see in the next decades of my life.This is entirely normal even in cases with mild injuries. Its just a negotiating position. If you have k in coverage then they can start the negotiation from  million and work their way down. If you have k in coverage and they ask for k then nobody is going to give them more than k. Also some jurisdictions just require you to say something like more than . Other jurisdictions require you to name a specific number. So why not ask for millions? Your chances are tiny but still exist of getting a  million judgement if you ask for M. If you ask for k then you chances of getting M are zero. This is called Jackpot Justice.gt  Ive filled a declaration of no asset to prove that I have no property or money which the plaintiffs lawyer could hope to get through a court judgment. Ive stressed the fact that I am a foreign national who will likely return to my home country upon graduation so no hope to collect reasonably. In the event that the case goes to trial and that a judgment is lodged against me Id most likely be forced to declare bankruptcy... surely plaintiffs lawyer realizes that? Yes of course they know all of that. If you got so freaked out that you hopped a plane it would practically guarantee their case assuming they could get the release tossed out. The plaintiff attorney will make it sound to the jury like you skipped the country to go join ISIS or something. Its his wet dream.  I mean the plaintiff attorney probably knows his case is shit if he has to put this probably eccentric if not mentally ill homeless guy on the stand to testify about his injuries against you. It would be much easier for him if you didnt show up for your deposition. Hes trying to freak you out. Hes headgaming you. Hell half the time when they make these crazy demands its because theyre buying time because they cant find their own client. Maybe they need time to get him through rehab.gt  I have to face plaintiffs lawyer soon to have my deposition taken. I dread it. I dont know how I am going to stay calm and collected facing this horrible person.Of course theyre going to try to rattle you. Thats what how they get paid. It helps their case. You just remain zenlike calm answer the questions they ask with the fewest number of words without elaborating or speculating and pause between when they ask the question and when you answer so your lawyer can object to the question or form of the question if he wants to. Keep in mind the whole time that their whole goal is to get you to blowup or speak without thinking so youll say something they can use. Expect them to ask you about anything under the sun. Remember that they are just doing their job for their employer and their employer is their client. If youre a lawyer and you do this job wrongly enough then your own customer the client can sue them for malpractice. There will be whole lines of questioning you didnt expect and possibly whole lines of questioning you cant believe they didnt ask you about.Not that you should try this but I once saw a witness drive the attorney deposing him absolutely crazy by having selective hearing. Can you repeat the question? over and over again randomly during the deposition. Got the attorney all rattled and blew the attorneys train of thought.gt So Redditors what do you make of this mess? In your experience do these cases ever see trial?Rarely. If you have no money then unless the plaintiff attorney thinks you have a sure fire bad faith claim against your insurer or theres no offer on the table theyd be insane to waste a bunch of money taking it to trial. Trials are expensive. Sometimes really expensive. That doctor sitting in the winess chair? Hes charging the plaintiff attorney hr just to wait in the hall to be called. Plus if you lose youre judgement proof because youre not a US citizen. You have a defacto getoutofjailfree card. You can leave the country.Its also not trial or no trial. It can end with a settlement at any time. The value of the case can go up and down on all sorts of things. Their client fell off the wagon? You did well in your deposition? Maybe the case value goes down for them. Their client got clean and went back to medical school and you lose your shit in the deposition? Maybe the case value goes up. I once handled a case where my insured was an old lady with a bit too much dementia to be the sort of person youd want on the witness stand. The plaintiff was grossly obese and wasnt quite in the crosswalk when she got hit. There was a juror who did not want to be on jury duty who was saying all sorts of stuff to try to get out of it but the judge wasnt buying it. She even said she basically hated fat people. The judge put her on the jury anyway. Five minutes later the plaintiff attorney was on his knees in the hall begging to settle for much less. We settled it right there. So it can settle on the courthouse steps in the middle of jury selection in the middle of the trial or even after the trial and verdict if theres grounds for appeal for the losing side.  The key part your insurer wont tell you So if at any point in this process the plaintiff attorney offers to settle the claim for your policy limit and your insurer tells them to piss up a rope then youre pretty much off the hook. Your insurer just turneddown the opportunity to settle the claim within your limits so if the plaintiff prevails at trial and wins a verdict in excess of your limit then you pretty much its the law so theres always exceptions but not likely ones have a defacto bad faith claim against your insurer. You can sue them for not protecting you when they had the chance. So you have say k in coverage. The plaintiff attorney offers to settle the claim for k. Your insurer says no. Plaintiff goes to trial. Plaintiff asks for  million. Jury gives plaintiff say k. Since your insurer turned down opportunity to get you out of it when they had the chance theres now an excess verdict of k on you. So what happens? Your insurer pays the verdict. All of it. Assuming they dont appeal it. So what happens if they dont pay or appeal it? The next day there is a knock at your door and the horrible plaintiff attorney guy is standing there. He puts a piece of paper in front of you that says his client will waive all claims against you that are in excess of your insurance coverage if you signover to him your rights to sue your insurer for bad faith. And the sky is the limit on that claim baby. So of course youd sign it. So to prevent that from happening your insurer just pays the excess verdict.Now if the plaintiff attorney never offers to settle for your policy limit and just sues you then none of that scenario above applies. Your insurer cant settle for your policy limit if that amount is not acceptable to the plaintiff andor nobody ever makes the demand. Then youre back to a trial andor bankruptcy and skipping town and all that but thats an insane gamble for the plaintiff attorney. Remember just because it goes to trial doesnt mean hes going to win. If your insurer makes a good offer and the plaintiff turns it down then theres also a possibility he gets a bag of dicks. I was once authorized to offer k to a plaintiff in the middle of a trial to settle a claim. The plaintiff attorney told us to fuck off. The jury did rule in his favor but then only awarded him . Really.TLDR Its okay to be a bit concerned. Its okay to be a bit annoyed. The view from  ft is the attorney is a bit of an asshat but hes really just doing his job maybe cant find his client and would be crazy to actually go to trial if he has a reasonable offer.         ,Insurance,czkn31z,7,t5_2qs6s

Is that the amount she could withdraw out herself or something? looking at some of the paperwork she got for the policy I see a bunch of disclaimers that say things like maybe not exactly this bc Im just going on memory benefit not guaranteed product may lose value etc.but on following pages it lists the guaranteed benefit for each year in the future should mom pass.

6803164,0,t3_48um2v,So youre looking at  per year for k whole life coverage and k term life coverage.  What is the term?     year?How much less than  per year would a standalone k term policy cost?That difference in cost and investing that money vs having a whole life policy is what you need to be looking at.Obviously if you were to die tomorrow the life insurance would be a hell of a great deal but odds are that you wont.  Odds are that you wont die for another  years.  What would a typical investment look like in  years vs what your whole life policy is worth?Ill make some assumptions here.  If this policy is costing you  per year per month I would also assume that you can get a k term policy for under  per month since you are relatively youngin your s.  So youre looking at paying  per month for the whole life portion of the policyand  a month for it once the term expiresIf you were to invest  per month at a very very consertative return rate of  in  years that is worth almost k.  At a more realistic  return youre looking at k.Now obviously like I said if you die tomorrow this is all moot and your wife would have wished you would have had the life insurance instead of the  monthly premium that you saved for  month.so...instead of doing k WL and  term just do k term and invest the savings.  Even k term shouldnt cost you anywhere near  per month and that savings invested should be worth well more than the WL portion of the policy by the end of the term policy.,Insurance,d0nfk9s,1,t5_2qs6s

There are a few carriers that will automatically grant coverage for food delivery but at state minimum limits.  But generally speaking food delivery drivers need commercial coverage that they simply dont buy.  But food delivery is something where the business has pushed what should be their liability on to their driveremployee.  That delivery exposure to car accidents really should be the businesss but the driver is the one in the primary position even though theyre acting at the direction of their employer.  That said you should expect that in your situation that youre likely running a real risk to your own business by using your friends.  Couriers are very different than food delivery drivers and generally they are required to have drivers that have commercial coverage and usually with fairly substantial limits and Im not even addressing the Cargo coverage depending on the class of vehicle.  I suggest that you discuss the situation with your insurance agent to make sure that YOU are properly covered here since Im guessing that you might have a problem with your own HiredNonOwned Auto coverage here.  As for your friends they can either choose to come clean or not.  I dont have any suggestions for helping someone lie to their own carrier.,Insurance,d3vntwh,2,t5_2qs6s

There may have been some information underwriting asked your agent for and didnt get so they are addressing the perceived increased risk. Make sure they have your drivers license numbers correct. A typo there is the biggest reason I have seen this happen. In NC an insurer is required to write state minimum liability insurance for anyone who asks for it. However if it is something they dont want to write they can cede it to the facility which means that the writing company administers the claimspolicy but the risk is shared by all insurance companies.

For example for damage to a Macbook Pro  take it to the apple store for a diagnostic. For other computers a local shop or Best Buy for a diagnostic. Damage to TVs  get a diagnostic done by a local technicianrepair service. That type of thing. All I need is the cause of loss what caused the damage whether or not its repairable and how much the diagnostic cost. If the tech says that its feasibly repairable we owe the repair cost if its not repairable then we owe the cost to replace it with a like kind and quality item my company doesnt do any Actual Cash Value policies. In this case I highly doubt that an adjuster is going to come out to your home they will likely be handling it from the office with you sending in the list of items diagnostics and invoices. Theres really no need for an adjuster to come out to your home. In terms of the company doing the remodel once payment has been issued through your policy your insurance company has the right to subrogate against the company if they do find them responsible for the damage. Theyll try to recoup your deductible and any funds spent on the claim. To be completely honest it doesnt really matter much to me as an adjuster or affect my job whether or not subrogation is successful. Your insurance company likely has an entire department or a third party company that handles subrogation.

The floor is only sandable to about  of its original thickness at which point the tongue and groove will start to break.Even if they paid the entire cost sanding isnt a repair its just discarding the damaged portion like if someone spilled grape juice on a roll of paper towels and the fix was to throw away towels until you got past the stain.Also Ive had my floors redone a few times over the last  years and .sqft is insanely low.

Often times theyll send claims like that back for reprocessing to apply additional payments. No guarantee of course but thats one path. Tontovila offers the other one. Anesthesiologists are known for not taking insurance contracts largely because they end up getting paid in the end.In terms of negotiating payment thats between you and the doctorfacility.

Bring your title though so they can issue it to you only not you and a body shop. They will set you up with a rental regardless if you are not at fault but you would have to pick it up at a rental branch on your own time. I dont know what state youre in but where I am they can issue you a loss of use check but its normally day for the amount of days quoted on the repair estimate.  Under normal circumstances we dont write an additional check if the repairs take longer.

9248841,0,t1_d8nxv90,I think you are anticipating a disaster without even an offer. I am not here to defend CCC I can say I have seen many people get paid way more than I thought they would because CCC came in high. In your case with a low mileage late model car I dont think it will come in good at all. You are probably getting nowhere near k but I think the way you are looking at valuing the car is not particularly industry accepted so you may have to adjust that. A good way to try and think of it is what could you have sold your car for had you been selling it prior to the accident? Sure  Honda Accords with K miles on them are going for  which is exactly why a  with a little less than k miles on it would be worth not as much as  model years newer with a bit more mileage. Most of the marketplace buys the  if they are both side by side with those vehicles both having a k price tag. Even someone you hire if you got to arbitration will likely look at it like that. In your case get the valuation and make sure it has every spec correct you do not have to demand it either. You are going to want to be pleasant with your adjuster instead of going in adversarial. My experience is that the public perception was that it was a negotiation with sweetening of deals etc and really it was a here is legal way of valuing your vehicle show us where the mistakes are and we can adjust for that but if the specs are accurate and the distance for the comparables is within acceptable ranges it is fair. Money was never added without a reason no sweetening. Your particular situation is going to be tough I am willing to bet the comparables are a distance away and valuing an almost  year old car is difficult anyway as there is not a giant marketplace for them. Sorry if I am not too helpful I am sure a lot of this isnt exactly what you would want to here. It has been years since I did this stuff so times may have changed. I just helped my friend through his total and it wasnt fun for him.

I would like to make it known that I did not verbally agree to settle my total loss claim for the amount listed on the email. I was explicit that I wanted this information emailed to myself for further review before I made any kind of decision on the matter.I would respectfully decline your quoted settlement on the following groundsRegarding the tax tag title tires and loss of use reimbursement I believe the following numbers are more accurateLoss of use reimbursement  days from October th through October th at the rate of  per day .Cost of tires North Carolina Certificate of Title Plate Fee This totals  not including the tax for the vehicle.Secondly I will dispute the quoted actual cash value of the vehicle. I have attached a more accurate Kelly Blue Book Report that takes into account features of the car omitted by your estimation.

I have linked to the listings on each number. mi. mi mi. mi.With these considerations in mind I respectfully have to decline your settlement offer and would like to formally request a settlement of  as a fair value for the actual cash value of the car in addition to tax tag and title tires and loss of use.I would like to reiterate that I did not at any point during our conversation verbally consent to nor agree to the quoted settlement you have emailed me.I believe for the reasons outlined above that I have provided compelling reasons to favor my requested settlement amount.,Insurance,d96jwwq,2,t5_2qs6s

Fortunately theres no law that says the OEM cant sell you their bumper for the same price as the aftermarket one yay capitalism! and in many cases the body shop will call up the dealer and thats exactly what theyll do. Just ask the body shop if they canwill get someall of the parts pricematched by the OEM. For American and Asian makes they usually can. Even if they OEM wont price match the shop may still match. The price of the part on the estimate whether aftermarket or new OEM isnt what the body shop actually pays for the part. Thats just a list price that the insurer pays the shop. Then this whole concern is moot.If the insurers were only allowed to use new OEM parts then the manufacturers could price them however they want. For certain parts of the car where all insurers only buy OEM parts like airbags thats what they do. Thats why airbags cost . Theres no competition.Your burglary analogy is apples to oranges. If your tenyearold couch gets stolen then yes your basic home insurance policy pays you the value of a ten year old couch.

I think that is an insane practice and Im curious if theyre still charging  fee for a new policy in addition to the commission they get from the company. We hired a few people to our agency that used to work there and they all have some interesting stories.. We sell for UPC and have never had a claims issue with them. Most of the carriers we sell do not have issues as theyre all financially stable AM Best A rating.. Progressive sells auto RV and motorcycle toys. The Home is more than likely an ASI policy as they just merged together. EDIT also progressive direct online is different than progressive that we use on the agency side... its goofy but at times we get better rates than the online version sometimes not. We typically only put people with Progressive if they had a poor driving record or something really goofy that would warrant putting them there.. No it doesnt make sense to go with USAA as it is brainwashed marketing. We ended up saving someone  grand over USAA  lower deductibles and better coverage and the guy was like Ill stick with USAA.
