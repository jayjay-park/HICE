9378191,0,t3_590ji8,It would be interesting to see the BEN creepypasta but I doubt theyd do it. Alex Hall the original creator might be up to sell the rights or something. He was last trying to make an indie film called Methods of Revolution last time I spoke with him.I dont know if it would lend itself well though... there was a whole ish phase arc to the Ben Drowned ARG that ended up pattering out with no conclusion and there was a lot of game jacking and dumb plot twists that didnt need to happen.I remember the community and forums that centered around the ARG and at the time I was a rather well respected member of that community and honestly learning more about it moved it from spooky to silly.If the Channel Zero people could do it justice it would be pretty cool but the ARG and pasta itself ended up not delivering in the end and Id be worried that it would just be super hoakey as anything other than a silly pasta.Penpal would be pretty amazing though. Thats my dream adaptation  the short film based on it was amazing as well.,channelzero,d94r36f,3,t5_2vb40
9404948,0,t3_590ji8,The one I want to see is The Dionaeasp? House. I think its my favorite over any other creepypasta. I bet theyll favor the most popular creepypasta in the interest of attracting those that will watch based on having read the original storys so Anansis Goatman The Russian Sleep Experiment Tulpa The Rake Jeff the Killer and  are all likely possibilities IMO.If nosleep counts as creepypasta I hope they make a season about.... anything uTheDalekEmperor has written.,channelzero,d9856df,2,t5_2vb40
9409863,0,t1_d98dc6a,Ive just arrived to this sub and I have no clue which accounts the OP is talking about so Im not saying hes right or anything but when you think about it if someone paid me to browse reddit and comment every now and then just to create a reallooking account I would very happily take that job.,channelzero,d98rl97,7,t5_2vb40
9481089,0,t3_5amrln,So can she see it cause of something to do with the seizures or cause shes involved with it? And did it seem like she was prepping to say good bye to her son like she knew Eddie was gonna kill him? ,channelzero,d9hqysj,17,t5_2vb40

9490400,0,t1_d9iw20t,Oh I didnt know it was Eddies body they found. Anyhow so why only now were they planning to put it to rest? Its like the mom didnt want to put he body to rest because she wasnt agreeing with burying him when Mike suggested it in his weeks episode so what were they planning to do? Leave it there? ,channelzero,d9iw7xe,2,t5_2vb40

9658228,0,t1_da3gn5l,I think Im the only one that thinks the whole family had some kind of power maybe going back generations. I think the father was turned into The Skintaker. Not a plothole though something you either put together or not. The importance of the story was the relationship between the twins.,channelzero,da3ku5j,3,t5_2vb40
10260649,0,t1_dc6gnud,I imagine that Channel Zero would take the basic premise and spin off from that anyway.,channelzero,dc73mmb,2,t5_2vb40
11200161,0,t3_5yy0s1,I love your creepypastas... But god your videos make you sound so whiny. Chill dude. I get where youre coming from in most of them but you seem a bit obsessive... ,channelzero,df1iw2y,2,t5_2vb40

11251422,0,t3_60hl61,I would also like to see an SCP adaptation as well but sadly I know the licence that the stories fall under would make this extremlly hard. Still one can dream,channelzero,df7bytk,3,t5_2vb40
