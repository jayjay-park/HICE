6608206,0,t1_d02l6ro,Pinto had looked around herself upon realizing her sudden change of location.  Where was this and how did she get there?  It didnt offer much in the way of escape apparently nor did it afford for use of terrain in many fashions.  Though she did find her pistol at her side and her rifle at her back.  Her newly acquired monkey backpack rested on her shoulders ammunition safely packed away inside.He heard the explanation of what she was supposed to do but she still wasnt usually much of a fighter.  Which is why she carried firearms.A figure started approaching from the side the other fighter.  She squinted his direction seeing and sizing him up for a while before he was close enough to recognize her.  And he knew her name.  Pinto frowned deeply.  What else could he know?  Her hand reached down to the holstered pistol and with a few spins and flicks of the wrist in a show of arming herself the barrel end was pointed directly at Akitos chest.  Angled downwards to compensate for her height.Oh I do comprehend the requirements.And it really did seem as if there was no escape without following the rules.  Pinto was sure she would have been able to find one if there were.  Her eyes having an unnatural skill for finding these sort of things.  She adjusted her glasses preparing and without another word fire off her shot at Akito.,StrawHatDavyBacks,d02ueqc,1,t5_3c0rz

He was obviously disgusted and showed no fear expressing his distaste for the battlefield.Oh god.These poor people. Burnt for a game! Matthew comically fell to his knees and looked to the sky above screaming why as if it were a dramatic event in a soap drama. Hopefully getting some chuckles but eventually stood back up dusted himself off after no one clapped. This moment never happened.Hows it goin! Names Matthew Jones hope we can get along!Matthew posed in his signature Lord Solaire Praise the Sun form as a greeting towards the man who holds himself as the sun itself.
