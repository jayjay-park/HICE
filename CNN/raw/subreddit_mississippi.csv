801744,0,t1_cgveida,gt You cant possibly think that the government is capable of providing for every disabled mentally ill person in this country. Ask people who have been in government run mental health facilities about their experiences.I think realistically... It requires both government and civilian intervention to provide for those in need that CANT provide for themselves. It requires everyone. What I can say is that in todays society there should be not one person that falls through the cracks if heshe truly needs help.gt No it doesnt make it true because a good portion of the population has no interest in furthuering their job skills. Thats their choice. If they are satisfied enough with a Walmart salary I have no problem with that. If they think they should get hr for choosing not to go to school and having a lot of kids instead thats where I have the problem. People should be responsible for their own life choices.This statement right here is why I give less credence in what you say as truth than you would like. There is just no way you can know this for sure. You couldnt possibly give me a reliable percentage   of how many people today doesnt have an interest in furthering their job skills vs how many people just cant. That entire statement reeks of personal anecdotes with a dash of typical Im better than others attitude.gt Blaming businesses for not paying people more than they are worth sounds pretty socialist to me.Businesses like people... Shouldnt get handouts from the government for no reason.

827515,0,t1_cgybu6f,So...here is the problem with your attitude. Criminal is broad very broad. Are we talking about someone robbing a store a knife point or raping their children? The person who robbed a store at knife point will be out in a few years. Now ask yourself if you have been tortured beaten up humiliated and shit on for so many years how exactly are you going to feel when you get out? We joke about prison rape but remember that rape destroys you. Humiliation for years on end changes a person. Is this for the better? Do we send people to prison so that they may be tortured so that we can feel better about hurting them? Or do we send them to prison to learn from their mistakes to gain the ability to function in a society? If the answer is that we want them to be better citizens when they get out then you are going to have to explain how the things mentioned in the post above make someone a better person. Please explain how someone who has anger problems will be made better by having to sit in period blood and eat sandwiches that have been in vomit. Please explain to me how someone with a drug problem can be mercilessly beaten and not desire their drug of choice even more.If shitty prisons reduced the crime rate then America would have the lowest crime rate in the developed world. However we dont see that do we? Recidivism in the US is fucking high like  percent and higher Wikipedia.

It would seem that poverty cannot explain the discrepancy here.  achieving excellence in math  rank  advanced placement  rank The first thing that strikes me is that funding is not the issue near as much as Ive been led to expect. If anything our funding is on the lowaverage side. Equity indices are also pretty decent all things considered. It would seem that the issues  at the minimum at least  cant be attributed strictly to funding. Of course more funding cant hurt but what can be causing the disparity in our performance? Family income and employment stability are serious issues per these results. Certainly a high percentage of parents without jobs living in poverty and with low level of educations does not inspire the greatest drive for education but you would think we could still average out better. Meanwhile we actually have good statistics in linguistics which is kind of impressive given our rather diverse population especially on the coast. In both major th grade measures we rank st. That says to me theres a serious issue at the elementary school level. If we agree that funding cant explain the entire issue and that family economics also dont tell the whole story whats the cause?  Is the quality of our teachers lacking? Is the curriculum being taught ineffective?  Is there an issue with the manner by which these data were collected? Is there something else Ive not considered? Preschool data actually looks okay. Head start enrollment is definitely crummy at nd in the nation but that doesnt make sense does it? Theoretically a good Head Start program should help equal out poverty differences as were providing opportunities and care for needy children. The issue obviously persists as we go forward but if our students are performing that poorly in elementary school its no wonder they dont perform well down the line. By these data perhaps our focus should be on our elementary education? These are just quick thoughts from someone who IS NOT a teacher but is married to one and lives in a family full of them for some reason. Also please forgive the crummy formatting on my part.

9707065,0,t1_da92inj,Born and raised in Vicksburg myself and some of my suggestions for having fun there include Consider taking up huntingfishing. There is a large passionate population of sportsman that live in the area and there is some type of game season almost year round.  If your dont like huntingfishing you can use some of the same places to hikenature walk but be aware what the time of year and day and know that you may be in the woods with hunters. Scare off their trophy buck and they get grumpy not shoot you grumpy but less likely to like you grumpy. Local sports. Its all about high school football. Go Vikings!!! Buy a big  wheel drive truck with big tires and an ATVSidebyside and take up off roading. Its tremendously fun but budget extra money for gas and repairs.  Study some local historyarchitecture. Vicksburg has a rich history influenced by agriculture pre and post cotton boom civil war racial relations and creole culture from across the river and further south. Vicksburg also has some beautiful old buildings and churches downtown. Since Katrina it has also experienced an infusion of musicart from people displaced by the hurricane who never moved back to New Orleans. A side note related to history is that Vicksburg has lots of ghost stories and even and old abandon hospital right in the middle of town with some youtube videos where ghost hunters went in to try to capture some evidence of haunting.  Local cuisine. Like its history Vicksburgs cuisine has many rich influences and I hope you like beer because it is the best compliment to a big bag of crawfish. Some places I recommend include TBeauxs pronounced Tbos Rowdys and Goldies Trail BBQ Definitely dont miss out of the casino buffets! Like others have said there is prejudice there on both sides but its more subtle than many places. When I was young it was very controversial for whites and blacks to datemarry. These days that would probably get you a behind the back disapproving stare. I had white friends and black friends growing up but gathering in front of school before building opened up in the morning I remember seeing hundreds of high school students instinctively congregate with their own race. There would be interaction at the middle some friends would easily cross over to talk to one another but the crowd separated itself into to two very distinct groups. ,mississippi,da9lr1k,3,t5_2qhht

9933172,0,t3_5hown3,Besides the suggestions you got for MS explore LA too. You said youd planned to go to NOLA well keep travelling and go hit Baton Rouge and Lafayette as well. I lived in Lafayette for a while and honestly think theres even better food options there than in NOLA without as many tourists clogging the place up. If you go stop in Breaux Bridge and eat at Chez Jacqueline for lunch she closes around pm or so it was cash only when I lived there but holy shit is it good order off the side of the menu thats in french. The lady that owns it is from France and while she does the typical cajuncreole dishes her french cooking is really good and so much better than the usual touristy places like cafe des amis next door. Also when traveling in that area there are lots of hole in the wall plate lunch places. These are usually a meat and  sides served in a styrofoam container often to go. Most of these often look kinda sketchy but are insanely cheap and incredibly good it was one of the things I missed most when I left LA for the western slope of CO. You should really do Mardi Gras while your there too. Go experience it in New Orleans for sure the huge parades there start up a while before actual Fat Tuesday so go there the weekend before and see the crowds titties and general craziness but go to Mamou for Fat Tuesday and experience a more traditional mardi gras where they still go door to door to catch chickens its kind of a dyinglost tradition. Also theres always festivals going on in south LA below I that are worth seeing when you get out of the tourist areas its really its own little world thats unlike anywhere else in the country.,mississippi,db2bfty,3,t5_2qhht

This isnt a new tax its just a tax that almost everybody avoids either unintentionally or intentionally.If youve bought something online and it charged tax its because they operate physical storefronts and must collect state sales tax. This would be like Best Buy Wal Mart etc.,mississippi,dcy57ng,3,t5_2qhht

10974309,0,t1_debhx52,I think you should go visit just to see the people! Im a photographer but I dont fish or hunt. I bet your kids would love it. Theres a reason everyone talks so slow  the heat. For most of July amp August a lot of people just stay inside. Not unlike January  February here. If youre outside at all you acclimate to it but its still pretty brutal. ,mississippi,deby583,1,t5_2qhht

11479646,0,t1_dfx76xx,Whatever. The thread is aboutgtMississippi governor proclaims Confederate Heritage Month.  If you people were ashamed the Virginia battle flag would not be at the top of the flag.  You would not be celebrating Confederate Heritage Month.  You would not  have secondplace participation trophies in front of every courthouse in the state. Not muh personally held beliefs clutches pearlsI have no doubt that you will respond to someone implying or outright calling you an ignorant resentful bigot for defending the confederacy by doubling down on being an ignorant resentful bigot. Some shits just so broke it cant be fixed. And thats how you end up th in everything good.  st in everything bad.,mississippi,dfx7qep,1,t5_2qhht
