9756657,0,t1_daf8pnv,Im flexible and happy to help let me know what works best for both of you. Heres some options Substituting stuff on the new box within reason is totally fine. As long as I have the flavors stocked Im happy to help improve the kit for you.  If you just need a few flavors added to a kit and want to avoid the shipping minimum I can order stuff for you when I place the BCF order and ship it at the same time.  If yall figure out how to split a kit or kits between you just let me know what you want to go where and Ill package them separately and run the numbers to see what actual shipping is. This reduces risk and eliminates the need for one of you to ship to the other if youd like.,FlavorBuys,dafq5ne,2,t5_3hnzc
