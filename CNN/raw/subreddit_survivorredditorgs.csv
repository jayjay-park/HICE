11689597,0,t1_dgkxkth,If Brad and you were behind the Joe vote then how can you explain this in his opening statementF. My plan was to take out Gabe because I felt he was the person at the time I had the worst relationship with. However the other three were dead set against him. That doesnt sound like he wanted Joe out at all. Very glad I decided to read over his speech again. This proves that you are hyping Brad up and giving him credit for things he had no hand in doing. I hope the members of the jury all see this because this is very very important evidence that Im telling the truth here and you are not. ,survivorredditorgs,dgl1847,2,t5_3g2c3
