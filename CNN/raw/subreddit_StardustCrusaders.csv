143896,0,t1_ceuno6u,hey Ive been thinking the same thing regarding this sub and ranime.this is weird specially thinking how much material we have and how weird it is so we can talk about it forever but I think everyone is going with the this is bullshit but I believe it kind of thinking.also the cute drawing actually made a lot of sense. so much that i find it weird that it wasnt included in the manga.to be honest all part are great when animated if part one was great you know the whole thing will be even better.one thing i really liked in part  is how sometimes the characters get bored and tell jokes mostly if not always Gyro is the one telling.and part  made feel like part  again in which that I felt really sad when the Zepplie died. i mean in part one it was meh... but in  and  it was great.anyway. i really hope to see more jojo stuff both in this sub and in TV maybe also in video game if ASB is deemed good financially,StardustCrusaders,ceutjxa,2,t5_2tny5

735711,0,t3_22hbzc,Its my personal favorite.  Its also the most Western of all of Arakis comics.  Literally in that its a Western but the artstyle plotting and themes are all very DC Special Imprint Graphics Novelesque.   Its basically Arakis Watchmen or Sandman.   So its a bit more headier and less juvenile than its compatriots.  That also means its slower and heavier on plot.,StardustCrusaders,cgnwk81,8,t5_2tny5

To further explain though Ill go over major plot points that are covered with each part.Phantom Bloods Joestar family introduced Dio introduced vampirism and the masks Speedwagon Straizo Hamon Zepelli etcBattle Tendencys Joseph continues the story Pillar men revealed as creators of the masks Caesar introduced family explanation for between part  and  George and Lisa. Stardust Crusaderss Dios Back! Stands introduced Family bloodline transfers to the Kujo name via HollySaxman making Jotaro side characters introduced such as Polnareff Kakyoin etc.Diamond is Unbreakables Josephs a slut and hes got another kid Josuke. Jotaro finds him Josuke has awesome hair THE ARROW IS REVEALED. Psycho murderer tries to off people with his stand the Jojos say Fuck that. Koichi turns into Gohan more side characters Joseph seen as uber old but still kicking.Vento Aureos Dios got a kid. That kid has a stand. They dick around with some mob boss daughter for a while mob boss pops up and turns out to be BBEG oh also Polnareff is in a wheelchair. Now hes a turtle.Stone Oceans Jotaros daugher Jolyne is in prison Jotaro comes back dude punches Stands out of people prison adventures Universal resetSteel Ball Runs Damn near new universe new Joestars Spin instead of Hamon races across the country horses Glorious Gyro Zepelli teeth Stands corpse partsJojolions Jouke has amnesia trying to find out his past finds out relation to SBR thats about it ATM.Again you should read part  but when it comes to major plot points in the series universe Part  has next to none.Crucify me if you will but the pieces of my body will merge with random people and theyll get crazy powers. ,StardustCrusaders,ck2zvy0,5,t5_2tny5

2467746,0,t3_2nsjyl,Blue Meanie Can cancel out any noise in a m radius and a touch from this Stand will slowly turn any organic matter into granite. This Stand is extremely useful for surprise attacks. The abilities of this Stand correlate with the objective of the Blue Meanies which was to silence all music and turn all the inhabitants of Pepperland into stone. Sgt. Pepper Similar to Wheel of Fortune this Stand possesses a vehicle of the Users choice. This immediately makes the vehicle able to travel through space and time with the side effect of turning it yellow. However it does not increase the durability of the vehicle. This correlates to how the Yellow Submarine was piloted by Sgt. Pepper Old Fred in the movie.Nowhere Man Allows the User to block out one of an opponents senses at a time often confusing them and opening them up to an attack. Based off the lyrics to Nowhere Man by the Beatles as the Nowhere Man in the film doesnt really do anything except accompany the Beatles.Lord Mayor Able to decrease or enhance one specific attribute of up to one object at a time. For example the Stand could enhance the durability of a persons fist or the speed of his strikes or it could enhance the fragility of a persons bones or decrease their reaction time.

3241355,0,t1_coxip4d,Id say you could do it with a setup similar to the Michael Jackson lean setup. In order to do this move onstage I think in the video its just camera tricks Michael used specially made shoes and pins in the floor. What he did was he used slits in the heels of the shoes to go around the pins and hold him and his dancers in place. Theres a patent and multiple videos explaining the effect if you want to see it. Basically though I think you could produce similar JoJo shoes with the slit in the opposite direction for leaning backwards at intense angles. Since he wears pants that cover the tops of his shoes you could design those to be more loose in the back. Apart from that I think it might be possible without special hardware and theatrical trickery if you have really good balance and have a relatively low center of mass. I dont think it would be feasible for someone of Jotaros size to do though. ,StardustCrusaders,coxz2bk,2,t5_2tny5

Thats it. It can be seen by nonstand users and stand users alike. When someone touches the fence the fence will come apart and try to wrap itself around the victim. It has a very quick reaction time and can hit hard enough to pierce through the skin. The stand can at any time upgrade itself to the fullest a fence can be. Electrified barb wired etc. It can then use these materials to fight.The stand manifested rather ironically as Eddie spent most of his childhood dreaming of crossing the border from Mexico into the United States. Over time he grew resentful of the world and the people that ran it and became a mercenary.StatsDestructive PowerBSpeedBRangeBDurabilityAPrecisionDPotentialA ,StardustCrusaders,cr1qeyr,2,t5_2tny5

But for a man at that age he still is pulling about the same percentage of shenanigans in relation to his younger self. When he was  he was globetrotting in the search of centuryold super humans all while being about  steps ahead of his enemy. At  hes ONLY travelling all around the world to defeat a powerful vampire for the sake of his daughter all while trying his best to keep up with a younger unknown batch of enemies. He might be sidelined and less useful but he still kicks loads of ass. Also Speedwagon Version  is no insult. I really feel that if Part Joseph was more like he was in his youth hed not only steal the spotlight itd be weird seeing him do it and would feel like a rehash for me.

So that unless we expressly see which mouth the sound comes out of it could be either mouth. I mean Stands are a personal psychic manifestation of your willpowerspirit.

5294605,0,t3_3nimp6,Like Delret said I think Dio would take his sons into his care once the Joestars were out of the way.However I think Dio would be most inclined to respect Donatello for his combination of cunning pride and ambition bolstered by the fact that he too was constantly thrust into bad circumstances. Giorno and Rikiel would probably be too goodygoody to have Dios full concern. While Dio would still raise them he would eventually realize that they werent about to take on his ways and try to keep them from becoming too powerful. Ungalo abusing drugs and being apathetic about those around him would likely remind him of Dario and would end up as the familys black sheep. In this case Dio would focus most of his attention on Donatello and let Pucci and Enya babysit the other three.Pucci would probably grow to like Giorno quite a lot considering the biblical implications of Gold Experience combined with his politeness and the innate glory of being Dios son. Provided Giorno was affected some by early childhood he would likely grow to dislike what a monster Dio is and try and convince Pucci to turn on him at some point. Rikiel would probably make fast friends with Giorno and the two would help each other develop their stands Giorno can create new rods for Rikiel to use culminating in Rikiel falling under Giornos sway and becoming a noble guy. Because I cannot see Dio approving of Ungalos lifestyle Ungalo would eventually grow to hate Dio as much as Dio hated Dario and the threat of a continuing cycle would dawn. He would develop Bohemian Rhapsody in secret and attempt an assassination.Donatello meanwhile would learn to use Under World in conjunction with The World and would probably be brought up like an heir.

Iconic and totally idiosyncratic to JoJo. But showing them the climax of the climax of Part  doesnt seem very sensible.If you dont want to show them Episode  maybe try Episode  so the start of Part . I know its controversial to say so but its usually a much better hook than Episode  which can seem a bit weird to newcomers.

5596095,0,t1_cwqoppn,The most genius thing about Jotaro is how all of his quirks and flaws make him look like a total s anime badass. He doesnt express himself well so he seems stoic. He says rude things because hes not very socially skilled so he seems like someone who doesnt take shit from anybody. Hes also strangely attached to his clothes and hat and never takes them off. Yeah Kakyoin never takes his uniform off either with the excuse that theyre students but there are two things to consider. Jotaro doesnt seem like someone whod care about that sort of thing or who has a lot of pride in his status as a student.. Kakyoin is kind of a weirdo. Nothing should ever be considered normal just because Kakyoin did it.People might find it strange if a person wears the same outfit all the time but this particular outfit just so happens to make Jotaro look like an awesome banchou. Basically Jotaro is almost a parody of the shounen badass.,StardustCrusaders,cwqqymc,15,t5_2tny5

I just really dont see any of the current characters in the story being a main antagonist although I can possibly see Jobin being related to the main antagonist. Theres still a bunch of questions that we need answers to so JoJolion will probably go for a while more after this so I think that the main antagonist will be revealed pretty soon possibly within the next few chapters.Either way dont jump the gun theres still a bunch of shit in the story that needs to be resolved so a main antagonist might not come for a little bit.

Its basically gonna be slice of life nonsense ala Part . Theres also gonna be a stand called The Band which temporarily seals another users stand if they user sings or hums the song or something from the album of by the artist the stand is named after.

6550323,0,t3_45auie,I have mixed feelings about part  the fights where pretty good and fast paced and some of the side characters where pretty fun to read. I also loved the setting araki is always good at doing that and it really shows here.But my problems with it is that gio is kinda a weak follow up to josuke. He just feels very bland to me and it really bothers me that they never used his heritage to its fullest.

6708172,0,t1_d0czl9n,Think of it this way. Gold Experience Requiem removes the effect but keeps the cause. While King Crimson removes the cause but keeps the effect.If you shoot a bullet at King Crimson a bullet hole the effect will appear behind him but the cause traveling bullet gets removed and he escapes without a wound.If you throw a punch at Gold Experience Requiem the punch the effect wont land. Itll just reset back to zero as if nothing ever happened. However the cause throwing the punch is still there. The infinite death loop can also be explained this way. Giorno used Gold Experience Requiem to kill Diavolo and the cause Dying was kept as normal while the effect Death got removed. You can also think of it like thisThe act of Dying the cause eventually leads to Death the effect no matter what. We can say thatDying gt Death What Gold Experience Requiem does is to keep the Dying part but remove the Death part making the chain like thisDying gt AliveSince Dying cannot lead to being Alive the cycle starts over again where the Dying part is kept but the Death part is removed. This cycle continues again and again until the correct chain of events is followed Dying leads to death. This makes Diavolo keep dying forever because his state of death is constantly reset.,StardustCrusaders,d0d6ksl,12,t5_2tny5

Complex substances ex. air which is comprised of many gases or incorporeal substances ex. light cannot be allergies. When the target comes into contact with the substance either by touching inhaling or eating they will develop allergy symptoms depending on the manner of contact. As the allergy worsens the targets vision becomes increasingly impaired clouded by visuals similar to TV static.

Weve already been given information on their history as knights their dedication to a doomed queen and how they were loyal enough to give their lives for their liege.Were told about how each completed the Ring Challenge Tarkus through his brute strength and Bruford utilizing his hair to give us a sense of their contrasting combat styles. Were shown that of the two Bruford could be seen as the more noble soul due to Tarkus welcoming his revival as a zombie in service to Dio.The purpose of Tarkus and Bruford isnt to act as fully fleshed out people whom were supposed to understand and relate to. Its to show how Dio has taken two figures of legend people both he and Jonathan have studied in the past and show how his evil has corrupted their once noble spirits. Even further it allows for Jonathan to take up Brufords sword as he restores his humanity acting as a means of showing just how evil the Masks powers truly are. Bruford is there to act as a credible threat to the heroes and provide Zeppeli with a chance to see his oncoming doom his fate and go willingly towards it. Both the knights act as a means of empowering Jonathan on his quest Tarkus by empowering his strength power and skill and Bruford through building up his spirit and humanity.Tarkus and Bruford are there to act as hurdles and lessons for Jonathan and if people cant remember their importance to the story despite this I hardly think its due to faulty writing.,StardustCrusaders,d1oc1wd,34,t5_2tny5

7511997,0,t1_d2uqal5,Kiss is so underrated because its stand power doesnt translate well to manga panels. Araki poorly conveys what Kiss is doing when she duplicates objects for the vast majority of Stone Ocean. Look at the pages where Hermes shoves Sports Max into a sewer pipe to drown him for a perfect example I had to reread those pages four or so times just to tell what the hell was going on.I get the feeling that Araki got so frustrated with trying to visualize Kiss power that he benched Hermes for most of Stone Ocean. She barely does anything after Sports Max and two of the maybe three or four times she uses her power in an interesting or creative way come after the CMoon fight the harpoon grappling hook and Emporio ghostbullet teamup. Highway to Hell is probably the best example of Araki struggling to apply Kiss since he defaults to removing stickers to damage objects over and over in that fight.,StardustCrusaders,d2w2rst,2,t5_2tny5

7624001,0,t3_4jmbjq,Because Vampire abilities are weaker than Stando power but the catch is having a Stando made DIO more vulnerable.I say they are weaker because basically DIO would have to come into physical contact with his opponent to do damage. Like close quarter combat. And he probably already knows Joseph Joestar is a Hamon user. So DIO could move in and slug it out with JoJo Sr. and potentially get killed or he could rely on his stand to do his fighting for him. As far as his stand The World goes DIO pretty much thought it was invincible so there was no drawback to just completely relying on it.

The stand can be sent places independent of the user but since it has no eyes or any facial features for that matter the user cannot see through it. The teleportation is slightly limited by the location having to be known.

7841390,0,t3_4mp71g,StarPlat stats are supperior to CrayCrayDs the fact that Jotaro lost the fight against Josuke without timestop of course could be explained because Jotaro didnt expect that much raw power and Josuke was in hair rage.That being said theres a lot of characters that refer to StarPlat as the most powerful stand in the world whether it means raw power or the absolute strongest has never being said. Personally I think that timestop is one of the best if not the best ability in the totality of JoJo simply because you cant do anything against it. Araki said in the Shoko interview that no one could defeat Jotaro without the ability to make time flow again. PERSONALLY I think Jotaro could beat Diavolo GER MiH and Tusk  or at least be in a close matchup.Now speaking of feats in strength StarPlat broke High Priestress teeth which suppose to be hard as diamond threw Iggy with inmense velocity Part  Spoilerss fired bullets with a flick of its finger damaged SHA threw Steely Dan and Darby Jr into breaking concrete walls and much more!

7895367,0,t1_d43i78k,Nah I agree that Part  dragged on with the minor villains however I feel like the DIO fight shoulda been dragged out a lot more. I dont really blame David Pro for the minor villains taking up that much time simply because the source material had that much stuff going on and David Pro did a great job on making the journey interesting by dragging out a few poses and iconic moments. The DIO fight however felt so short and a little on the flat side to me. I wanted a lot more suspense and big BAMMM impact moments in that fight to stand out. The feeling of the fight when I read the manga was that DIO with such a strong stand kept going at Jotaro and it was so suspenseful waiting to see how Jotaro could get out of the situations. The anime did not have as many pauses and just skipped a lot of poses for the sake of finishing off the arc and it just fell flat for me. I had expectations of the DIO fight to top the Kars fight but it was nowhere close really.Im just very scared that David Pro might allocate very little pause for each impact moment or pose that really makes the manga stand out. The part  anime has been more or less fine up to now but I can definitely see a few poses and moments in the anime that could have stayed on screen for  or  secs longer.Anyway the Tonio ep was great so Im still enjoying the anime. I just had this all building up inside me and I wanted to rant. ,StardustCrusaders,d43igqk,8,t5_2tny5

7951433,0,t3_4o5krk,Its just David Productions being too faithfulTheres a few moments in the Jotaro vs. Dio fight too that I remember being too faithful where something that looked okay or just a little bit off looked really off in anime form.For example the flying never bothered me in the manga because people tend to float around in JoJos. Many times it looks like characters feet never touch the ground. Its just the way they are drawn. Araki does not respect gravity so when they started flying around in Egypt it wasnt any different from when characters were floating around a bit in other scenes. But in the anime it was super obvious that they were just flying for some reason when they kept the characters more grounded in other scenes.,StardustCrusaders,d49temh,49,t5_2tny5

Hey Ya and Heavens Door are straightup broken though I honestly wouldnt be too comfortable with the ethics of using the latter beyond self defense. If Harvest managed to bring in a reasonable amount of loose change each day it would set me for life. Pearl Jam would be amazing and Id happily put up with the side effects in exchange for my body functioning properly for once.But in all honesty Im not the nicest person out there. And Ive always said that if I could have any one superpower Id take the Penance Stare and never turn the damn thing off. So with that in mind Id take Civil War and immediately use it for the betterment of society.Id start with the politicians. Id make them feel the weight of every ounce of suffering thats been inflicted on the world as a result of their greed or blind ideology. Either they change their ways or get ripped apart by the souls of those who have died thanks to their arrogance. And I would broadcast the whole thing as a warning to other blights on society that they are not beyond consequences. Imagine a world where the rich and powerful actually had to answer for their actions. Think how much better things would be if you could only force the people who make decisions to consider the ones who will be hurt by them.

I liked his introduction fight everything. Best pillar man behind Kars.Stardust Crusaders Lots of good ones here mainly because the entire story revolved around minor antagonists. The usual for me Hol Horse Daniel DArby and Vanilla Ice are all good choices. Just to be unique Ill toss in Boingo. Hes my personal favorite.Diamond is Unbreakable Hoo boy. Lots of good choices here but ultimately Ill agree with you. Yuuya Fungami is just too great not to be my number one here. Runner up would be Aya Tsuji though. I dont know why but I just like her a lot.Vento Aureo Its a common opinion but Pesci is pretty great. Character development during his only fight? Awesome writing for his character. Does Doppio count as a minor antagonist? Because I absolutely love Doppio hes my favorite JoJo character in the entire series.Stone Ocean Heres where the pickings get slim. Not a whole lot of good ones here and were gonna get a lot of the same answers. Rikiel Miraschon and Miu Miu seem to be fan favorites and Id have to agree. Solid good part but lacking good minor antagonists.Steel Ball Run The gold mine of minor antagonists. Ringo Blackmore Magenta Wekapipo Diego Oyecomova.. So many good choices but my favorite is definitely Diego. A great new take on an old villain.

When things are illegally supplied like manga or ROMs its more likely that law enforcement goes after the suppliers than those buying it its usually not worth the time it takes to track down someone readingconsuming something and even then its more likely the parent company will send a notice to stop to protect their product before law enforcement even gets remotely involved like what happened with CoolROMs.Stay away from torrents or majornew releases get stuff at home and from websites that have been around a while.,StardustCrusaders,d5hqdy7,3,t5_2tny5

8343687,0,t3_4tu7qp,. Everyone sailing away from Fugo. He had a connection with everyone on the team and had a REAL chemistry with Narancia. Narancia even leaves him for tiddy and hes left alone probably thinking that his best friend will run back to him when this whole ordeal is over and done with. Still better than what Araki originally managed to do him though.... Jotaro in Part . You have to kinda remember that Jotaro spent  fucking days around no one but the crusaders and hes never shown hints of having mutual relationships in other parts. All of his friends are dead by part  barring Polnareff b ut you cant really be friends with a turtle. Speaking of Polnareff he could also be in this spot as he went through the same shit but saw  of his greatest friends die right in front of his eyes and they both ended their lives trying to save them. He also lost his sister seems to have no parents and is bullied by DIOs stand lackeys. Anywahys Jotaro goes out protecting his daughter who dies right after him and realizes that back in  he really did lose to DIO. is a pretty weird pick for most. Its Abbachio ol lamb meat for me. His backstory was a bit painful as his job had him caught in a tough place and he lost his partner because he tried to take the easy way of said hard place. He then had the little heart to heart with the police officer whos quote I have hanging up on my wall and had a very fitting death. It was a sorrow that felt good. is Shigechi. Id first like to say fuck this sub for praising speedwagon and having some fucked up demonic resentment for Fatty. Anyways shigechi was introduced a  year old kid with some pretty bad social skills and a desperate desire for friends. He makes a friendship with Josuke and Okuyasu over cash do a bit of scamming together win the fucking lottery and gets a little too greedy when it comes to splitting the money which isnt good but its understandable for someone to do as he did all the work while the Jokuyasu duo just kinda jacked off. They get into a cool fight and becomes firends a live happily ever after for a few days. He then bojangles with Kira gets his fucking brains blown halfway out of his head and instead of using harvest to scuttle his body away to a hospital at ridiculous speeds which he can do he wastes time trying to warn Josuke and Okuyasu so they can escape from this monsterous killer. And people hate this cinnamon bun smh the very existence of Johnny Joestar. Just..... Everything dealing with this guy is extremely sad.EDIT Im replacing Johnny with every character in SBR.

He cant make people losegain a Stand tell him something they dont know which would probably prevent them from literally seeking out and finding Kira theyd just work toward finding him like everyone else make the blind see or part s the crippled walk Jesusstyle heal injuries bring someone back from the dead etc etc. On top of that if someone cannot see Rohans artwork such as Josuke after being blinded by rage he doesnt have any offensive power to harm them normally and is thus boned no two ways about it.With all that in mind HD is still stupidly powerful but there are workarounds and limits that prevent it from reaching say part  endings Gold Experience Requiem levels of stupid powerful where its literally unbeatable by nature of its power.,StardustCrusaders,d5oglrn,5,t5_2tny5

This was how he did Yu Yu Hakusho and most of HxH. When you spend years doing that it probably gets to you in some way Araki is a rarity and honestly he must be very positive and welladjusted if hes managed to be this consistent. That probably did contribute to his health problems which are another thing. You are probably aware of how shitty certain pages of HxH looked during serialization it was honestly embarassing and yeah it was mostly because of his health problems that this happened.

I dont know why Josuke and co. couldnt go to Shigechis family and told them what had happened even if they would not believe the stand stuff they would at least get to know their son was avenged. And yeah a lot of families arent going to get the satisfaction of their familyfriends being avenged but in the end Kira did get his just desserts. Though I feel Part  has probably the happiest ending I havent finished Part  yet so this may change of the current parts.Part  only has Shigechi and Aya dying in the main hero team meanwhile Part  Spoilerss Part  Dio kills George Joestar Dire but who the hell cares about Dire lol Jonathan and zombifies dozens of innocent people. Part s Caesar and One of the instructors deaths vampire army createdPart s Avdol Iggy and Kakyoin also countless number of people DIO fed upon.Part s  Narancia Abbraccio Buccelati and Polanreffs original body.Part s  Jolyne Jotaro Weather Report Annasui Ermes F.F Though they did all sort of come back its pretty much if they had no memories and is extremely bittersweet F.Fs existence also was forgotten by everyone except EmporioBut in Part  only minor heroes die while the main hero squad of Josuke Okuyasu Koichi Jotaro and Rohan all live on with no wounds. Morioh goes back to being a quiet and occassionally robust resort town. Though I guess in hindsight if Kira had been murdering for  years he racked up quite a bodycount but iirc he only murdered under certain seasons and he must not have murdered constantly since nobody even knew there was a serial killer in Morioh besides a police report that was probably buried by other more urgent matters.,StardustCrusaders,d6pjqrv,7,t5_2tny5

If he had even  seconds of time stop I think hed be too strong to even be in play here just based on what Ive seen of Kira. Chili Pepper had the benefit of knowing Jotaro could stop time before even meeting him did they ever explain how he came by that info?.

9018164,0,t1_d7v15qv,While this is true some of Jotaros underperformance might have to do with plot convenience. And more effective use of his powers could have worked better for him.Jotaro after part  seemed overcautious to the point of it being a bad strategy. If you dont activate your powers and let the others activate theirs you are going to suffer because you let them dictate the pace and have to use your power to react.This applies also to Dio too in part  and how he used his time stop ability.Jotaros weakness is especially long distance and automatic stands and he lets Kira get away. That being said in his defense he had Koichi there to protect.To be again fair Koichi did manage to survive a bit on his own though he knew about the heat. And Jotaros inaction letting Kira get away played a role in Koichis mistake. Anyway  if you dont activate your powers first but have to use your powers to survive avoid the powers of your opponent you might be in a worse situation. Use your powers strike a blow to your opponent instead of having to use the time stop to react. This isnt always possible but timestop shouldnt be used only defensively. Sometimes the best defense is a great offense.In fairness too short battles arent as entertaining so I prefer Arakis choice to an alternative of Jotaro easily ending the opposition. But I think there is some plot convenience to in the performance of OP stands like The World or Star Platinum.,StardustCrusaders,d7vuc4p,5,t5_2tny5

9163719,0,t3_55s0pf,I started reading JJBA somewhere around . I watched the OVAwasnt particularly impressed to be honest and a friend of mine recommended me the manga saying that it was much much better.Back then I used to hang out on the JoJo forum and in JoJo threads on chan and a proper JoJo TV series seemed like an impossible dream back then. I even remember people joking what if they make an anime and constantly change the color palette of the characters honoring the lack of canon character colors in the manga? knowing full well that it was something impossible.One day during the summer of  I woke up and had nothing to do. There was a ton of minor JoJorelated things going on in  since  was the th anniversary of the manga and in  it was  the th anniversary of Arakis career as a manga artist. Ive heard there was gonna be some livestream related to the JoJo exhibition and decided to at least look at itfor the record I dont know Japanese can only read kana. When the countdown started I realized something interesting was coming up but when they showed the anime announcement and the ASB trailerthat looked amazing I was shocked. At first I had to double check that I wasnt sleeping and that it actually happened. Then the shock changed into... euphoria I guess?To be honest when the first episode came out I wasnt particularly impressed with the animation quality. That animation quality problem remained throughout Part  though it didnt stop me from enjoying it. The Part  adaptation was amazing and made me fall in love with it even though I didnt like it that much when I was reading the manga. I couldnt finish Part  because the pacing was too terriblein my opinion so I just selectively watched  the fights I liked after it came out. Im greatly enjoying Part  so far even things that annoyed me in the mangalike Shigechi.Im glad that after all those years JoJo has returned into mainstream media and is finally getting the popularity and recognition in the West that it deserves.,StardustCrusaders,d8dkgx8,30,t5_2tny5

They are badass they have golden hearts at least preSBR and even then its arguable Johnny was the one with more noble goals and actions they defy fate they form great friendships they grow as people they are battle geniuses and yes at times they goof around. Of course some parts emphasize some of these aspects more such as part  and s goofing and part s battle genius but you can still see all those aspeects in every Jojo.In other words I think youre taking the other Jojos at too much face value or just focusing on goofiness too much.

9407908,0,t1_d98304c,Aw man. We got another one fooled by Valentine. Valentine is objectively evil if you pay attention to his actions in comparison to his words. The interesting thing about Funny Valentine in comparison to the rest of the characters is he is in fact actually is just truly evil but mirages his actions as a necessary means of defending his country. Valentine has not once ever shown even the slightest it of interest in his own fellow Americans. His wife his minions his allies even his own fellow citizens have been all worthless to him. Funny Valentine does not care about America but he loves the idea of America. Valentine is moved by the passion of patriotism towards his country and most certainly is an idealist. This is the reason he is willing to often lay down his own life multiple times through multiple universes in order to preserve his idea of ruling with America by his side. Ultimately though Valentine is no better than villains such as DIO or Kars who only seek power. Valentines greatest fantasy is to rule with power and influence with his nationality by his side. But Valentine truly couldnt give less than a fuck about the people of America themselves as evidenced by such incidents as Valentine killing innocent Americans with no hesitation Valentine trying to rape one of his allys wife setting up a dangerous race knowing it will be at the expense of the American people etc.Thats the magic of Valentines character though is how convincing he really is. He makes you want to believe that he is a valiant patriot but at the end of the day he is just a typical scummy Jojo villain.,StardustCrusaders,d98io6j,14,t5_2tny5

In terms of a story I put it ahead of Stardust Crusaders. Josuke is way less onedimensional than Jotaro gt  Kujo and the villainoftheweek Stand Users arent actually just villains of the week. The story doesnt just forget they exist like Stardust Crusaders did with most of its villains.But Part  tends to have less amazingmemorable moments than Part .

9593342,0,t3_5cctg8, Bites The Dusts awakening probably set time back enough to bring him back to life since the whole reason behind it was Kiras fears of being found out with Hayatos death.. I think that the events that Heavens Door read may have been the fateful events of each loop that cant be avoided without ending BtD. Since nobody was killed before Rohan we can assume that there was no previous loop. Thus the writing in Heavens Door was from BtD not Hayotos memories.,StardustCrusaders,d9vkqsm,5,t5_2tny5

9671387,0,t3_5ddnxw,Ill be voting for JJ and Pit of The Cleaners!The Blues Brothers would have a very good strategy maybe if a winning strategy if they didnt forget about one little thing. They dont know either of their opponents Stand abilities and made no effort to figure them out. Big mistake the entire Cleaners strategy involves them taking advantage of this detail to the full extent.Big Jacks idea of setting the hotel on fire is good and all but theres material all around the hotel for JJ to take advantage of he could easily smother the fires with Brick House if they got too bad. Pit would remain invisible as he goes up to the top floor even if his other fluid evaporates. Sweat is a thing. Also Im pretty sure  int is enough to avoid slipping and sliding on any banana peels.The idea of allowing Gene to fail his Jojolity is actually quite clever. It leaves room for many more options. Unfortunately they forgot about the part where knocking Gene flat on his ass wont be the last attack they throw at him and the knife that he isnt suspecting will put him out of commission for good.And that leaves Big Jack in a v against a borderline reality bending Stand and a calm level headed gangster earthbender. Needless to say hes out of his league. Speaking of calm and level headed Big Jacks Jojolity is a bust and JJs is a certain win. Throwing minor annoyances at him will never outmatch the soothing and therapeutic power of a kabutomushi.Also just wanted to throw this in here.gt Memory Lane is and always is a Star Platinumlevel beatergt B Speedlol,StardustCrusaders,da57955,2,t5_2tny5

The coffin locks from the inside and Dio explains that that particular coffin is built to protect him from the sun as well as withstand an explosion. When the ship explodes the coffin is seen briefly in the burning engine room before it appears later in the water with Erina in it.  years later the coffin is pulled from the water by treasure hunters who comment that the coffin is locked from the inside demonstrating its the same coffin from the end of Part One. After the coffin has been opened its revealed there is a removable compartment allowing for something or someone to be placed underneath. If Dio was in the coffin and the compartment placed over him Erina could have sat inside the coffin while waiting for rescue after her rescue the coffin would close and sink to the bottom of the ocean.,StardustCrusaders,db7b0rk,1,t5_2tny5

10126039,0,t1_dbr4w21,As I mentioned before it is a part of Joshus character to take things too far. It was necessary for him to do something to Kaato in order to defend Daiya and Araki decided for his action to be in character i.e. going too far but still mostly doing the right thing. It could have been anything because Joshu has shown that he can take things too far in a variety of ways. It was just sexual this time because he thought that would be the most embarrassing thing. Thats what Im talking about when I say the storys writing and Joshus character are linked. Araki could have just had Joshu trip her or push her but thats not what Joshu would do. Joshu would never stop right there given his prior characterization and how high his emotions were running during that scene.As for Paper Moon King you understand that its a story about Yasuho losing her autonomy but the scene with Joshu is an important part of that because he fills a role that could not have been reasonably filled by another character. Like I and Meti have stated Joshus misconception was perfectly reasonable but it probably wouldnt have been as reasonable if someone else were in Joshus place. Had it just been some random stranger the situation would not have progressed to the stage it did. Being caught with another person you dont know in a sexual situation that you didnt consent to is terrifying as is the concept of losing your autonomy. The scene with Joshu is just one example to reinforce how scary the theme of losing your autonomy is. The scene in Paper Moon King is as uncomfortable as it is partially because it is Joshu there and not someone else. Having it be someone who knew and does actually care for even if he is weird Yasuho has a greater effect than it being some random guy or the scene not being there at all.,StardustCrusaders,dbrfgm1,1,t5_2tny5

10137365,0,t1_dbsuqkv,Yeah I didnt like how Johnny also asks her after falling on top of her in her nun outfit if shes ever had a boyfriend. Like why would that strike you as one of the first questions to ask someone you barely know? What would it add for you to know the answer to that question?And yeah it doesnt portray Scarlet whos actually bisexual not gay but I understand what you meant as a good character. I know shes the wife of the main antagonist but she completely disregards security to bring this yearold married girl shes met only once before into the Presidents house just so she can bang her.And indeed that aforementioned naked woman like the runaway girl in Part  who wasnt named until the anime was merely a plot device that couldve been removed entirely from that fight with little to no change to the actual proceeding events. She even has a somewhat tragic backstory of being used by everyone she meets and Sasame apparently took pictures of her in bondage to make Kira look like a bad guy which is strange because he only wanted to kill Kira and if he knows anything about Kira hed know that not many people would come to his apartment anyway  something that temporarily caused conflict between Johsuke and Yasuho but also couldve been cut out with little to no problem  but it never goes anyway its just window dressing to a character that isnt really a character at all and ends up hiding in a fucking trash can for some reason.The reason she thinks that JohsukeKira came back to save her isnt resolved either since Sasame never mentions anything about having trapped Kira prior or Kira escaping he just mistakes Johsuke for Kira whos already died and as we know wouldve been nowhere near his house and Sasame when he ended up in the circumstances of his death and jumps the gun.,StardustCrusaders,dbswic9,1,t5_2tny5

Initially Diego was inflicted with Scary Monsters before he was given it. Up until he made a deal to work with Sandman to assassinate Johnny and Gyro he simply just tried beating them to the finish and the corpse part. He even tried avoiding conflict himself before Gyro beat him down and wounded his horse strengthening his resolve and pushing him to murderous intent.

10220258,0,t3_5mabdx,I read parts  and about half of . Id say part  is about equal to part . Like many have said its just a basic monster of the week plot but Polnareff Kakyoin and Avdol are much better supporting characters than the canonfodder hamon users of parts . The stands usually make more sense than Josephs asspulls usually and Joseph is still there to bring the comedy. Part  is...ehhh. I know opinion is riding high on the anime that just finished but this part killed my interest. Its very VERY slow. Its supposed to be. The idea is to frame the story in more of a slice of life than a stop vampires from taking over the world. If that works for you youll love it but I miss the over the top masculinity of parts  and it seems like Josuke gets relatively little attention in his own part compared to the jojos that came before which is a shame because his stand is really creative without being broken. Ive looked into the later parts and starting with part  the art takes a huge shift. For the worse in my opinion. I dont really have any interest in what Ive seen of parts  and  and  onward is basically a new story that uses jojo references to be more popular I guess. TLDR enjoy part  and hope youre one of the people that likes part ,StardustCrusaders,dc2iv26,3,t5_2tny5

10341610,0,t3_5ny1n5,Hello.    First time on this sub but I came up with a Stand and I wanted to share it somewhere.   Definitely doesnt follow the foreign theme but I dont want to make a shitpost.  Name Make Me Bad  Appearance  average cool humanoid stand  Nyarlathotep amp H.R. Giger.  Stats   Range  Meter radius from host.  Strength A  Speed C  Durability C   Precision C Doesnt really focus on direct combat even if it isnt weak.  Passive The Negative One The more damage he deals to living things the more angry and violent they become. Can make people and other animals blind with anger enough to enrage even the corpses of its harsher victims.  st Ability People  Shit makes all weakwilled people within its radius become blind with rage. This ability has a slow start but crowds quickly get out of control when swept by the momentum. The affected can can spread the rage to others. nd Ability Twist Can twist the words of people causing others to perceive their words and actions as negative ones. Example If Make Me Bad fought Josuke and Okuyasu it could Twist Josukes words into ones that would unreasonably anger Okuyasu causing them to start fighting. Its really tough to see through.  ,StardustCrusaders,dcga3ub,2,t5_2tny5

10359739,0,t3_5oazw6,Cameras record electromagnetic waves of light. It could work if Stands were actually visible in say ultraviolet or infrared. But the cameras we use are attuned to our senses so they dont register light outside the visible spectrum.Even more any computer iPhones included further encode that information into binary. So its just a bunch of zeroes and ones that are then decoded and shown as moving images. If a Stand were able to see more then that information must be encoded in the file which means a normal human could program some way to see Stands through video. So it could work if the bits of the computer have stand power in them? But then what if we copy the file elsewhere? Or edit it? If we apply an enhance filter would we also enhance the image of the Stand?Imagine I have a picture of a Stand. I cant see the Stand. If I use MS Paint to draw the exact same image pixel by pixel exactly and save it in the same format as the original would both files be the same as in containing the same bits?But of course Stands are basically magical so the rules dont apply to them.,StardustCrusaders,dcic5d6,3,t5_2tny5

I mostly knew JoJo from the Za Warudo memes. One day I decided that I may as well read the manga so I could better understand the meme but I only got as far as the part where Dio first becomes a vampire.Several years later In  I was looking for videos of flashy super moves in fighting games and stumbled upon AllStar Battle. This rekindled my interest so I read through the entire manga.

If this were the case I find Dionne would have a much better chance of winning. In fact I feel like it would work to her advantage given it will give her an opportunity to escape and change her face.

And from what I could tell from their tactic they are going to do just that. Junky Luck is going to crash through the door which will trigger the coin trap causing it to explode in his face allowing Dragon Force to proceed with the bill traps next. Even if this does not cause instant death Junky Luck will be very heavily damaged and wont be able to use his stand to its fullest extent. And since a lot of their plan revolves around him doing most of the hard work with his clones going around everywhere I find their plan is going to fall apart. ,StardustCrusaders,dd4fskp,2,t5_2tny5

10752011,0,t1_ddotk9w,gtAnd BtD is not a Requiem. A Requiem is the product of the Stand being pierced not the User. BtD would be more like a powerup than anything.Thats debatable. Killer Queen wasnt manifested at the time and since a Stand comes out of the user when it manifests I dont think its a stretch to say that Killer Queen was pierced when Kira was. BtD still has some key differences compared to GER or SCR since it keeps its original appearance and powers and it was made with an arrow that has a gap in the arrowhead instead of a beetle so I cant confidently say it is a Requiem either....I wonder if Araki has ever been asked about this in an interview. ,StardustCrusaders,ddozkb9,3,t5_2tny5

10766202,0,t3_5tumbf,Alternatively the lineage could stem from Joseph of Arimathea.His son was Josephus so supposedly the same naming scheme could work for his son onwards.Also i guess his lineage apparently moved to England and was involved in the keeping of the Holy Grail which would make sense as the Joestars as we know them begin there. Imagine Jesus teaching JoA hamon while using the Zeppeli wine glass test but with the Holy Grail instead.And in SBR JoA asks Jesus himself when they will meet again and he gives him the map of the corpse parts before departing. He himself would not meet him again but his descendant in Johnny would in SBR.I have a theory that this partially applies to the PB universe too in that they begin with JoA as servants of God and they are finally freed of their servitude at the end of Stone Ocean.

10771440,0,t3_5u29vt,If theres one thing part  excels at its character dynamics. My favorite is probably Mista and Giorno considering how Mistas a hotheaded punk who is extremely superstitious and how Giorno is much more subdued than any other member of the gang hardly ever saying what he wants outright. He doesnt even start going after the boss until Buccellati gives him a reason to do so. Mista describes Giorno as lucky which is probably part of the reason that Giorno gets along better with him than anyone else in the gang. Mista is a firm believer in concepts like luck and good Mojo in no small part due to how he got himself in Buccellatis group in the first place. He was a kid in the streets down on his luck who was picked up from his lowest point by a man he began to idolize. Mista almost sees Giorno as a Buccellati in the making which is fitting due to how he takes up Buccellatis torch after he finally passes on. I feel like its no coincidence that Mista almost always worked with Giorno. Mista was the first member of the team who wasnt Buccellati to actually go along with Giornos plan in the Kraft Work arc and after him the rest of the team slowly starts to realize that Giorno was more than just some kid Buccellati picked up off the street. Theyre readily willing to put their trust in each other in White Album and when both of them fuck up big time they manage to pull through. Mista is the first team member that Giorno can see as a comrade and hes closer to being an actual friend than Buccellati was. God damn I love part  so much.,StardustCrusaders,ddqztam,23,t5_2tny5

Its not mentioned until Part  when Joeseph is talking about persuasion.Now sure early on the implication is that Storheim is not a good guy but Id say thats a misdirection if nothing else hes shown to be prideful to a fault sacrificing himself for Joesephs sake and later coming back with backup to save him.

10900049,0,t1_de48rvu,That isnt what I said at all? Im comparing them because to understand what both are doing its useful to see where they are the same and where they differ. Id actually consider Part  to be structurally the perfect JoJo part since its focus on smaller personal stories let it explore a wide range of ideas. It also as the post outlined is all about community and coming together which can be seen in how minor villains become recurring characters.So its notable that Jojolion has essentially the opposite of all that despite being set in the same place with much of the same ideas for characters. I think thats actually a part of the point with Jojolion where it much like Steel Ball Run are a reexamination of the JoJo franchise as a whole. Notable Plot points involve an importance on the familythe family tree the end of Johnny living with the higashikatas Holly. ect.

10942110,0,t3_5w9xec,I kind of agree with the Pillar Men complaint. Wammu and Esidesi are cool but nothing at all near Dio levels. Overtime Kars has grown on me a lot more because at first I thought he was pretty boring. Its one of those things where just because your villain is stronger than the previous one doesnt make him better. Kars could eat Dio no problem but Dios well written character and relationship with Jonathon was just so amazing that its hard not to love the little shit. Kars is cool too tho cause he shoots piranhas from his wings. thats p coolAnd I  agree on Lisa Lisa being underused. Shes a huge massive badass but pretty much did nothing of major value besides training Joseph and Cesar. Shes still awesome though even if a bit underused for my tastes. It makes sense though shes not as smart as Joseph is so she could never even stand up against Kars in any way really.Where I have to disagree with you on though is Cesar. I also knew he was going to die that OP made it pretty clear. But the way he died is what made me get a serious reaction. Dying not only after failing to defeat an enemy but also without being able to amend things with Joseph is what makes it so heartbreaking. They never got to settle their differences. No final show of respect he just dies and thats it. Hes a Zeppli hes going to die for the JoJo. But in the way he did woof. That was rough.Overall though glad you enjoyed it! Its rare to see people not prefer Part  vastly over Part  so this is a pretty fresh take on it! Most people adore Joseph and everything about Part  minus the lack of Dio so its cool to see someone with a unique take on it. Cant wait for you to see Part !ps.

Its different and it makes it an underdog story except the dog is crippled. Basically the message of the story is look at this guy. Hes at rock bottom and cant use his legs yet he made something of himself. He brings himself down constantly and the entire journey is a struggle with his self esteem. The whole way is either I cant do it or im going to fucking kill this guy. My point it Johnny is very relatable especially to people who are going through hard times as of now. And i think thats beautiful. Johnny is a beautiful character.Also its a Western with superpowers. Its just objectively a unique and badass premise.

10976618,0,t1_dea6pks,Funny Valentine achieved his goal by bringing the corpse to a safe place where it cant be abused for greed even if he died and had to pass the task on to someone else. Johnny achieved his goal of walking and earned his fathers forgiveness. Hot Pants overcame her guilt from her past actions. Diego became a revered horse jockey and went from the bottom of the lower class to upper class. Gyros goal to save the boy was achieved even if he didnt achieve it himself and the boy later died of a cold. Steven and Lucy Steel were able to protect each other from the president.  Mountain Tim achieved his goal of dying for others as a true man of the law. Johnny and Gyro mastered spin. Tons of goals were achieved. What makes part  so good is how realistic it is. It isnt like part one where its clear a pure hearted guy takes down a super evil guy. Part  makes you question who is truly the bad guy. you feel sympathy for the villain because of his motives and his goal. In real life not everyone can over come their goals as thats not very realistic and would follow the stale old story pattern. The entire premise of JoJo is that it defies average story patterns and makes a realistic and interesting story. In life not everything is so black and white with a happy ending.  ,StardustCrusaders,dec6r3f,1,t5_2tny5

11107315,0,t3_5yiuko,When all I knew was the title I assumed that something called JoJos Bizarre Adventure could only be a wacky surrealist comedy similar to Bobobo. Then I heard people talking about the plot and characters and I assumed that it was normal and dead serious and that the title was a misnomer. Turns out it was actually in between the two.Also I read about Dios Bone on the wiki and for some reason I thought that it was in Part  not Part . Combined with me getting spoiled that The World came back in SBR this made me assume it took place after Stone Ocean and was about the villains trying to resurrect Dio. Even when I found out the truth I thought that Valentine was literally going to use DC summon Part era Dio from the old universe and I was disappointed when it just turned out to be an alternate Diego.Edit Almost forgot I knew that in SBR someone was going to become pregnant with the disembodied head of Jesus...but for some reason I assumed it would be Johnny not Lucy. Im somewhat concerned that that was my first assumption. Similarly I knew the line Kakyoin did you lay this egg? but not that it was from a doujin so throughout SDC I kept expecting Kakyoin to end up with an egg and be asked if he laid it.

11130750,0,t3_5yqjc7,Well let me begin this vote by saying that Steppen not only completely predicts Michaels strategy but has an effective plan to immediately defeat him whatever way you cut the admittedlyvague plans of Automatic Mans user as does Viviana while the Diamond Dogs strategy this round amounts to hide and shoot with zero distinction between foes except for the assumption the other two will go for each other. Not to mention Automatic Man is sorely underpowered in a straight vv and disguising himself as Michael But Clearly Slightly Different is a waste of its powers.Both Viviana and Steppen have VERY poor effective ranges with Viviana having the advantage of a slight range advantage and limited teleportation while Steppen has his boastedabout hunting skills.It was difficult to think about and admittedly I started composing this vote without knowing who I would side with. Steppen has clearly put more thought into countering NPB than Viv has BtbW while Viviana relies on Steppen painting a target on his back with his JoJolity when Steppen completely ignores it instead.That being said he does make one classic villain move after making an impressive amount of plans around countering NPB he suddenly switches to her personality is too weak to counter a vicious hunter mode seemingly forgetting the very impressive offensive stats of his opponent. CQC is where she flourishes the most and that slight range and speed advantage over him makes all the difference.It was a difficult decision especially since I had to break it down to raw stats vs stats at all but my vote has to go to Locas Motions.,StardustCrusaders,detnsig,3,t5_2tny5

11138822,0,t3_5z1g1b,That Mista bit actually happens in the novel.Heres the full gallery.I get the impression Maijo draws a lot while hes writing and there definitely may be sketches included in that that are for scenes he considered but that didnt make the final cut of the novel. Almost none of these are in the novel though a few are in a collage on the inside of the cover. Basically if there isnt a page number associated with them it isnt from the book. And the page numbers are from the Japanese edition not mine.Chapter  just has some extra illustrations imagining what daily life was like in the Joestar household.Chapter  has some stuff with Jojis classmates and cases he solved in junior high. Possibly he wrote more on this and decided to get to the point a bit faster. WTF is up with this berserk bicycling image I am very curious. Theres also a collection of The killer...is you! poses. Chapter three has a bunch of extra images of Penelope. Edvard Noriegas shirt is amazing. Chapter four has a few extra shots of the Morioh Stand Masters. This is the famous namahage detective from up north. NYPD Blue may be my favorite design for a Stand ever. Chapter five doesnt really have anything extra. Chapter six has Kira dancing with a victim which is amazing. But shes not Lisa Lisa so thats still nonsense. As well as Shigechis Stand Stray Dog which isnt mentioned in the book itself. Valentines frog stand gets the name Singing in the Rain Nothing in chapter .Chapter  has Prosciutto and his stand Twister as well as a name for Cioccolatas Stand Blob.

In addition I took week long breaks between arcs to avoid fatigue from all of the fighting arcs that preceded it. The story isnt great but the importance of their settings the overall pacing of the fight and the intimidating power of White Album made it a person favorite. The story didnt matter much to be because the actions pacing was so incredible which is something that I find applicable to most of VA.

Berserk isnt just randomly violent its established pretty early on that the entire culture of the world its set in is disgustingly savage and violenteven in the background where we cant see it. And similarly to the method that Game of Thrones employs it takes the violence that actually did happen in medieval times and combines it with more fantastical and modern storytelling techniques.I mean even Part  is in a fairly civilized historical period but could have focused on Gothic design like Bloodborne or something.After that Berserkesque violence wouldnt make sense.

11375625,0,t1_dfkw9yo,I agree with your arguments about Giornos tactics being markedly different from Dios but the way I interpreted the OPs statement is more that Giorno would likely have ended up just as twisted as his father if he hadnt been saved by the mysterious gangster early in his childhood. That incident I feel really shaped Giornos later personality as it stopped his stepfathers physical abuse and most importantly taught him to trust people. Thats something Dio who had to free himself of his father through his own means never learned arguably until meeting Pucci. Its likely that both father and son have an innate touch of ruthlessness so its not all nurture but in Dios case this is aggravated by his upbringing while for Giorno its mellowed to make him more of a morally gray character.,StardustCrusaders,dfleos0,5,t5_2tny5

11389292,0,t1_dfmy2eb,Hmm you are correct that L would probably be able to find Kiras identity rather quickly then assuming he didnt use Cinderella.gt of the stand fights consist of people using their stand to create openings to blow eachothers faces off with revolvers. I am currently reading Part  but you said it yourself. Stand users can do that. But L doesnt even know what a Stand is and has no way of knowing based on what Kira does.gtStand users arent immune to bulletsKiller Queen has been shown to keep up with Crazy Diamonds punches so its reasonable to assume that it could easily deflect bullets.gtthey sure as fuck arent immune to an assault by a highly trained team of people using automatic weaponry and explosives.Sure if they were to drop bombs on Kiras house he would probably die. But thats not how the SWAT team operates at all. gt Maybe Kira could take out a few S.W.A.T. team members but the chances of him taking out a whole group are slim to none.I strongly disagree. Again youre forgetting about Sheer Heart Attack. Theres no possible way that L could know about that since Kira would only use it as a last resort. One explosion would take out several SWAT members at the same time and then he could just use another. Kira is no fool.

11564693,0,t1_dg6uhdm,Ah so its a very limited ambush zone basically but if its lost Mummy Dust only has its physical properties to go on for the next  hours which is the kind of weakness a protagonist would have.Adding levels of some stat check is actually a good way to handle it. If you make Dust quantifiable then it could be that expending more of it adds more checks which must be beaten and the difficulty of the checks can be one of the things which improve as your character levels up.Its a pretty versatile and yes Bizarre series to adapt into something as direct and literal as dice rolls so you need a good GM but it sounds fun.Id actually been meaning to make a post suggesting that all Stands may have the PhysAbility split meaning we havent seen what Stands like Harvest were capable of at max. I still should.Mummy World seems like a more aggressive version of Highway Stars trap but it makes sense that its stronger because it has a MUCH shorter range.Mummy Dust is actually a pretty good villain Stand maybe moreso than a heroic one both because of its nature and its seeming invincibility being strong enough to resist physical restraint and hold its own once separate making it a twophase battle. It mostly has to be outwitted or overwhelmed by a Star Platinumstrength Stand without some gimmick ability managing to separate it or the User either forgetting or having to forfeit Mummy World to accomplish something.Good touch that it has to have its solid body touch targets though.

11797768,0,t3_68br48,Had this idea for a while nowItd be a key that I could manifest like Hol Horses Emperor which I could put inside of any surface like beach boys hook so anything from a wall a window a tree or even someones body. It would then open up the objectperson up like a door to a small safe and the inside of the safe would be about a foot wide high and long. The safe door would then only close if I locked it again. I am the only person who can use the key and I can only open up one at a time since it is the same exact safe each time only it moves around. This means I can store and access different items in different locations anywhere I want. The surface would require to be relatively flat and about the size of the safe. The interior would be metal but the exterioronly being the door would remain as the same material input the key in. Opening a safe on someonesomething would cause no harm or damage.
