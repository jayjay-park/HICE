4303747,0,t1_csaqwmr,What I find particularly frustrating is the fact that on the some key issues Im mostly in agreement. For example nonEU migrants trying by any means necessary to get into the UK is not a situation Id like to see solved by just opening up the borders. But because I dont join in with ridicule and dehumanisation of these people Im apparently a typical leftist guided purely feelings and a puerile idealistic ideology only subscribed to by the educationally sub normal who wants to betray the country by allowing diseased ridden terrorists to sponge off the state gorging themselves on underaged girls before they finally decide to commit a horrific act of terror.All for not joining in with the daily two minutes of hate.,badukpolitics,csar9qq,2,t5_33p59

4879076,0,t1_cu9hvth,gtI think problematic is a well defined term within academia which means that when considering an issue there is a problem when considering it.  I think that when two people with very different assumptions try to discuss something the words actually mean two different things to those people.Precisely. In academia yes but in common parlance its a word used to both invoke victimhood and subjugation. Youve said something problematic. I cant believe youd say that! leaves the recipient scrambling for context as to what infarction they may have caused.gt to talk about racism with someone who rejects the very concept of racism is problematic. Neither side can make any meaningful headway.Context is everything. Obviously if people are talking at cross purposes then there is no meaningful dialogue going on. The discussion needs to take a step back at that point and build a common language on which to discuss issues. Thats a diplomatic issue rather than an intellectual one.gtSocial Justice is somewhat nebulous in practice. I like to use more practical guiding principles Do as you would be done by and leave things a little better than when you found them being two examples.The former is about equality something I wholeheartedly support. With equality there is a clear line to aim for. Regardless of any context each person should be treated equally as the next. The latter is more difficult because define better and for whom? If were talking about costless improvements in a social context its rare that anything more biased than equality is the most positive outcome.gtRadical Feminism is another of these nebulous ideas really. I have little to no common ground with a Dworkinite position for example whereas someone like Caitlin Moran I can agree with quite readily on some things. What kinds of things count as radical is very much in the eye of the beholder as weve seen with the reception of some of Corbyns ideas.Ive not heard of the term Dworkinite before what does that mean?My brief Google of Caitlin Moran whom Im sure Ive read in The Guardian at some point didnt yield anything I would consider positive simply because she seems to have kneejerked when the accountability of more radical feminist groups has come into question.Honestly Im not on the Corbyn bandwagon at all Ive managed to insulate myself from it so far. Ive actually spent more time looking at the other candidates and found them severely lacking. For all the talk of Corbyn will doom Labour I dont see how Andy Burnham as a viable alternative if he has to go up against Cameron.gtI think in the sake of consistency that I should point out that British Values are just as nebulous as Social Justice.This I think is the crux of where weve been coming from for the past couple of decades. New Labour claimed this back in the late s and I didnt agree with it then and still dont agree with it now. I would argue there are lots of nice aspects of British values which are shared with other civilised relatively liberal countries of inclusion and that sort of thing. Modern Britain is like that and should be celebrated and possibly codified. We should all hold ourselves to a higher standard and as a nation we generally do. I think its a bit selfflagellatory to say were all a bunch of horrible racist people when were generally not and mostly havent been.,badukpolitics,cu9jn2n,2,t5_33p59

5070916,0,t1_cux734v,ruizscar is sometimes right and often wrong. But I think he has a point here. And it is this by preventing Palestine from moving forward and becoming a state as in two state solution and having a seat on the UN and all of the diplomatic opportunities for peaceful resolution that entails the State of Israel is guaranteeing a state of perpetual war in the Eastern Mediteranean.Now youll know that plenty of Palestinians and Israelis work together in an attempt to foster a ground up dialogue and a settlement between people. Id say that a healthy portion of both communities would like to see peace and would be prepared to make concessions to see that happen.However Hamas and Likkud who are currently in control of the State of Israel are currently set on a noconcession total victory type rhetoric even though they have both privately calculated that there is no possible victory and that for both organisations perpetual war is preferable to a compromise settlement.The Zionist organisations the Labour Friends of Israel and the Conservative Friends of Israel serve as lobbyists for the Zionist cause in the British Parliament. While these organisations support the State of Israel in denying statehood to the Palestinians then its difficult to see how the peaceful segments of either side can pressure the extremists in their own camps to make peace. ,badukpolitics,cux8jm1,4,t5_33p59

11405374,0,t1_dfoqydd,See youre stuck on the idea of increased wages being the only measure of whether something is better or not. There are plenty of other things that matter too. But anyway youre still missing the bit where I mentioned it doesnt have to be eitheror and my personal preference for a mixed economy and a lot of left leaning people would likely be fine with too. To bring that back to the point initially at hand surely by now you can recognise that in order to try to prove your point that people who oppose fascism are really all pawns of a violent revolutionary agenda youre having to resort to selective readings of academic theory and obsolete historical examples ? Youre not giving evidence youre presenting theory and supposition. And seem to have no appropriate  evidence based on case studies of contemporary examples and no personal observations from which to make hypotheses to test.To make a crude analogy it looks like youre trying to explain how to make a fried egg sandwich to someone else having never made one before yourself by referring to poultry rearing manuals fluid dynamics and wheat photosynthesis processes. Youd probably do better if youd watched someone else do it first and then just explained what happened that time. Overthinking the issue had led you to some batshit conclusions and put you in a position where youre accusing people of things theyd think you were very paranoid or a bit of a knob for claiming. ,badukpolitics,dfos9a3,2,t5_33p59

11462728,0,t1_dfv9ohb,Ah it just does the same thingLate one evening MultipleBrexitWounds was walking towards The Sovereignty tired from a long day spent playing monopoly with real money with Paul Nuttalls. MultipleBrexitWounds sighed exhausted but unwilling to sleep. Recently his nights had been filled with vivid dreams of repealing Eureferendumwatch stroking his gorgeous knee with his elbow. Mmm thinking about Eureferendumwatch was having an immediate effect on MultipleBrexitWoundss anatomy. He loosened his clothes to stroke lightly at his elbow and was just starting to enjoy it when Paul Nuttalls came suddenly into sight. Thinking fast MultipleBrexitWounds ducked silently Gold BathroomAs Paul Nuttalls went on his way MultipleBrexitWounds paused to look around and realised that he wasnt alone. Eureferendumwatch was there beside him. He was about to speak when he realised that Eureferendumwatch hadnt noticed his arrival. For good reason! Eureferendumwatch was sprawled half naked at MultipleBrexitWoundss feet groaning as though engaged in a bout of polling and rubbing his knee vigorously. MultipleBrexitWounds blushed and waited for Eureferendumwatch to finish not quite resisting the urge to touch his own knee in sympathy. Finally Eureferendumwatchs back arched and he climaxed loudly crying out MultipleBrexitWounds! MultipleBrexitWounds coughed.What are you doing here? Eureferendumwatch said.I was just passing. MultipleBrexitWounds replied with an unconvincing smile.Oh well I suppose you had to find out eventually.Find out what?That ever since we met Ive been dashing in here to play with my knee and pretend you were doing it. Eureferendumwatch sighed but didnt look too upset perhaps because hed spotted MultipleBrexitWounds plucking thoughtfully at his own knee. MultipleBrexitWounds felt suddenly bold.Touching your own knee is nice he said but wouldnt you rather rub it against my elbow? Eureferendumwatchs eyes grew huge.Of course but I thought you wouldnt be interested.What made you think that?Ive seen the nude photomanips of Anne Widdicombe that you keep your cabin.Oh that. No I made them for Paul Nuttalls so hed have something to do other than playing monopoly with real money with me.Whats wrong with playing monopoly with real money?Nothing Id just rather have a night of repealing with you.Meanwhile . . .. . . The GhostofMargaretThatcher was hanging around Aaron Banks Mansion when she heard a sudden cry from the direction of The Sovereignty. Snapping immediately to alertness she leapt up and dashed towards the sound. It sounded as though Eureferendumwatch was in serious danger! Within seconds shed almost reached the source of the cries. She dashed forward only to reel back at the sight of MultipleBrexitWounds and Eureferendumwatch naked in front of her. MultipleBrexitWounds was sprawled over Eureferendumwatch trying to pull some sort of The Lisbon Treaty out of his nostril!Whats going on? she said shocked.MultipleBrexitWounds looked worried.This was repealing Eureferendumwatch he said when he asked me to use the The Lisbon Treaty on him. I did but then it got stuck.It didnt mean stick it into my nostril Eureferendumwatch complained its supposed to be used on your Earhole. MultipleBrexitWounds tried to pull the The Lisbon Treaty out again and Eureferendumwatch groaned and kicked him.The GhostofMargaretThatcher looked down at the struggling men. She felt slightly jealous. After all shed often wanted to try a little repealing with MultipleBrexitWounds herself. Still Eureferendumwatch looked so helpless with the abused The Lisbon Treaty sticking out of his nostril that she couldnt remain angry for long.Perhaps I should help she offered After all it cant stay there forever. MultipleBrexitWounds looked up at her with a combination of embarassment and gratitude..Ill hold Eureferendumwatch by the neck while you grab hold of the The Lisbon Treaty.Nodding The GhostofMargaretThatcher knelt and took hold of the The Lisbon Treaty. It was slightly warm as though MultipleBrexitWounds had been using it on his elbow.Pull! MultipleBrexitWounds shouted.Ouch! Eureferendumwatch cried as the The Lisbon Treaty came out with a loud wallop.Thankyou The GhostofMargaretThatcher MultipleBrexitWounds and Eureferendumwatch both said at once.No problem The GhostofMargaretThatcher said with a grin. Would you mind if I kept the The Lisbon Treaty as a souvenir?Yes I would Eureferendumwatch said. Im using it on MultipleBrexitWounds tomorrow.Ah well The GhostofMargaretThatcher said regretfully. She gave a last saucy wink to MultipleBrexitWounds and headed off in the direction of Aaron Banks Mansion. Shed be thinking about MultipleBrexitWounds and the warm The Lisbon Treaty for a long time to come.,badukpolitics,dfvak8b,3,t5_33p59
