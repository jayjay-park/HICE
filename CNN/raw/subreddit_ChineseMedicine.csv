5819986,0,t1_cxidwz5,the way to treat this in traditional east Asian medicine is to better facilitate the breaking down of difficulttodigest materials phlegm  dampness and stop or reduce their accumulation.Give your body opportunities to process phlegm.  be relaxed  by keeping our selves in a parasympathetic nervous state i.e being relaxed the body directs blood to core organs this gives them resources to start moving through their todo lists so to speak.what this means after a meal or as often as possible take  min to be relaxed. Any thinking of far off places todo lists or exciting mental stimulation will send blood to the muscles of the body we want more time spent with blood being directed to core organs so they can better catch up to working through accumulated material that needs digesting. associated point when we lay on our backs blood moves through our liver and other core organs with ease  keeping a soft liver will allow it to process a higher volume of fluids at once  practice relaxing on your back for  minutes each day to encourage a soft liver and organ function generally.keep a high core temperature keeping a high core temperature will facilitate digestion which is what we want to do. ones feet should be warm and ones brow should be cold this is an easy indicator of balance we want to achieve. Make sure you are keeping warm feet because fluid passing through feet looses its temperature and carries cold back into our bodies lowering core temperature and reducing the potential for chemical reactions  organ function in general.reduce or stop the ingestion of unusable  undigestable materialsdrinking water straight? our bodies warm up this liquid and it runs right through us carrying our heat with it  dont count on water for hydration a good mineral balance will better conduct the presence of water in the body  strive for optimal digestion to achieve this rather than drinking our recommended daily water intake. If you feel thirsty use a tea something more molecularly complicated than water as well as something decaffeinated.stop eating things right out of the fridge they are cold and will slow down the digestive process.stop eating dairy and sugar they are difficult to break apart in our bodies and add a lot to our digestive todo lists which we are trying to minimize.lastly Im going to recommend a lung tonic which might help that you can make at homeslice a pear finely and stew for a few minutes on medium heat in . cups of water  remove pair and discard.bring the remaining pear water to a boil over . cups of rinsed white rice.discard the rice drink the water as a tonic.if you really need to cough and feel something is stuck or logged in your chest try firm acupressure on this point to attempt to move the phlegm   liv.If you have the time let me know what happens or what you think of these tools. I recommend you apply them as much as possible for  week keep a journal of what lifestyle tips you employ that day and how bad the wheezing was  this is a good way to see if these strategies are helping you.,ChineseMedicine,cxiiwi5,2,t5_2rips

9981150,0,t3_5ifab5,This sounds awful.  First of all just from the stand point of other medical professionals taking us seriously well why would they if youve got this kind of bullshit going on.  If we treat our places like spas well never get respect.Also it seems to me like the no taking clothes off thing is just plain malpractice.  How would you clean the skin under the clothes?  How would you know if they have some sort of skin condition that you shouldnt needle into?  If you cant view and palpate the area properly how would you know if something is out of place or not.Hey the industry sucks and its hard to make money I get that but you cant take some easy money for something that will hurt everyone in the long run.,ChineseMedicine,db8klsc,4,t5_2rips
