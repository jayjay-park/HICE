8805671,0,t3_50qpkv,Im a CS student at Warwick uni. I cant speak for Southampton but I can certainly recommend the course at Warwick. Theyre both Russell group universities so at the end of the day Id imagine youd probably get the same out of the course in terms of prospects. I can say the course at Warwick has very good links to industry with the second year software engineering group project being sponsored by an industry partner Deutsche Bank in my year.Maybe you need to consider university life outside of the course. Some people arent fans of Warwick because of it being a somewhat isolated campus not really far from Leamington Spa or Coventry but it has a reputation for being in the middle of nowhere. You may find youd rather go to a city university. Have you visited eitherboth of the universities?,UniversityOfWarwick,d76bm5t,3,t5_2s9uc
