4251245,0,t1_cs4ldwy,I had a doctor once tell me stop lifting so much weights. She clearly hadnt heard about the HAES movement yet. Just because I was heavier than most of my peers and had dreams of becoming. Bodybuilder that doesnt mean I was unhealthy. BMI clearly is not reliable because it doesnt work on me and that means its only . percent accurate as a measure of health for the population. Thats not !!!! Therefore you shouldnt worry about BMI!!!!!,thinpeoplelove,cs4tvzy,1,t5_388f8
