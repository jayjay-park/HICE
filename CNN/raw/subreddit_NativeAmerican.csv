3797472,0,t3_33rjio,I would like to get Sandler and that producer in a room and ... calmly read to them witness accounts from the Congressional Record of the Sand Creek massacre where the americans under Methodist Pastor Chivington brutally murdered unarmed women children and the elderly who were meeting under flag of surrender to be relocated to a reservation. And Chivington in particular cut out the womens vaginas and wore one as a hat decoration when giving talks about his accomplishments with the christian american crowds approving.This is what I think of when I hear of another white man going around referring to native women using terms that are meant to be a reference to genitals such as Beaver equating native women as pieces of meat for the white men to cut up and parade about for their own horrific psychopathic profit.Tasteless humor is one thing. Extreme racist attacks are another.The name could have easily been changed to Antelope Breath and it would still be stupid offensive and inane but it would not have reached this particular level of outrage and racism. That the producer would not change this term after being confronted with it by the cultural advisor and the actors means he absolutely intended this offense.,NativeAmerican,cqp547n,3,t5_2qr1c

4530559,0,t1_ct172xv,To be honest Ive struggled with thoughts of suicide since I was probably  Im  now. Very different circumstances obviously but Ive definitely had a lot of hardships of my own. Really though I dont think I would ever expect to be a legitimate member of a tribe because as you say I was born and raised with zero connection other than maybe some kind of blood lineage.I guess for me I just spend a lot of time thinking about what would my forefathers have wanted for me? The only person who ever really gave a shit about me was my grandpa  ironically who I had no blood connection with but because he never had children of his own he treated me better than any of my actual family. I think about him quite often if Im the kind of person hed have wanted me to be what are the sorts of things he thought were important... He passed when I was still fairly young and I never had a chance to learn the things he valued.I think in a way thats why I want to connect more with... well whoever Im descended from. I have red hair but I have no idea if my blood is Irish Scottish or something else entirely especially since Ive heard several times that I look like I have something else in me. I heard my greatgrandmother was a Native American and I guess it was just kind of the first thing I latched onto. Those questions I wish I could have asked my grandfather I guess my hope is that maybe Im descended from something more than the lazy cruel drugaddicts that I grew up with.I mean I know that probably sounds silly and maybe even a bit juvenile. I just feel like theres something I dunno missing.,NativeAmerican,ct1pnto,1,t5_2qr1c

Assimilation means to become absorbed into the framework. Example Ive ADAPTED my diet to be healthier based off the traditional Japanese diet that emphasizes fish vegetables and whole grains as well as exercise.  I have not ASSIMILATED into Japanese society or culture. Am I comfortable going to Japan and enjoying myself there? Absolutely!

11389377,0,t3_628r87,It seems there are  member states of the UN so your all the flags of the world but not including indigenous flags group would be around  as well.In north america theres currently  federally recognized indigenous nations tribes in the US. Theres hundreds of more nations in Canada and Mexico as well and then we have central and south america.Not all have flags or have flags that are easy to find. You did a good job finding  indigenous flags.To reduce all these separate independent nations to one flag yes that would be very disrespectful as would the implication that we are the immigrants.I recommend instead you keep the  flags and remove all the rest and reduce those to a single UN flag. You can then group the top flags into legitimate first nations of turtle island and the blue UN flag label it illegitimate illegal aliens. Does this seem more reasonable to you that your original proposal? It does to me.Thanks for checking in. Most people dont ask.,NativeAmerican,dfmytu1,5,t5_2qr1c
