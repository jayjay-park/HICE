5834420,0,t1_cxkeq1f,Dont you beat me on the play by just turn  double dust devil? Unless Im mistaken that kills me since youll get  in before I can doomsayers conceal and then before it pops you flame tongue and destroy me.,5cardhearthstone,cxkf3tw,1,t5_3b1sm
5835885,0,t1_cxkjhdm,Im not ganging up Reno. Refer to the comment the sludge Belcher method. Our matchup was the one that required the most thought ... At first I could only tie but I squeaked out a win.,5cardhearthstone,cxkm0yy,2,t5_3b1sm

5896950,0,t1_cxs83zd,X |          Total | X          Gang up on snakes is too much. Gang up on doomsayer is not enough to deal with double gang up. I didnt calculate but gang up doomsayer should clear you stuff and let me win with Anubarak even if you gang it up. I have the tempo when it comes to that. Gang up on shade  Doomsayer leaves me with one more shade to get in that damage. I leave it stealthed until it reaches  and I kill him. Stealth doomsayer kills the first wave of s but the second wave I cannot handle. Fuck double gang up.,5cardhearthstone,cxsmhbi,1,t5_3b1sm

8446353,0,t1_d5x9piy,The easy explaination for the Jaraxxus meta is that people like infinite damage so that they can win matchups where their opponents dont have it once they clear all their stuff. Its also a good heal if you can get to its turn but the infinite dmg is the big one. Shadowform would have been overplayed if allowed and youve seen some Charged Hammers as well for this round  anything that gives you an effective unconditional hero power to work with in the lategame is great and it allows you to win games by running your opponent out of resources. There are many counters to this see Rafaam tempo swing and Shaman rush and I think people felt forced to bring Twisting Nether and ended up getting rushed early game way too easily but Jaraxxus was something I instantly thought about when going over the various classes and options  first thing I checked was infinite hero powers after seeing only MajordomoHammerJaraxxus I decided to go for the nd as it had the best matchup against the other two and it was supported by a monster opening that can also rush down slower decks but I can understand people that tried to go for the full stall  the only reason Jaraxxus didnt do well is because people had all the counters.,5cardhearthstone,d5xbybb,1,t5_3b1sm
