5126138,0,t1_cupmi94,At a regulatoryquality seminar right now and the woman just blantanly said most startup companies are focused on the science and technology behind the products they are making and not on things like quality which comes later. I immediately thought of this convo lol,Synek,cv3w4b9,1,t5_36efc

5845789,0,t1_cxlvoos,Yeah seems that way too.  I just like putting half of my  gallon batch into bottles way easier to take to parties.  Unfortunately kegs smaller than  gallons seem to be more expensive than  gallon kegs.,Synek,cxlwsos,1,t5_36efc
6182476,0,t3_3yyx41,We had a broken oring which we fixed and it helped but you have to really be careful about the hoses. I also had my first cartridge leak though I think that was the fault of the taphouse overfilling. Still no response from Synek folks. I wound up getting an email from them saying are you around right now? If so well call you....emailed them back within  minutes and they never called. Go figure.,Synek,cysdszq,1,t5_36efc
