677559,0,t1_cgha72y,Thats great.  I wish the BMDinfo.org folks or other online Berner communities would have a more thorough discussion on owner experiences with a variety of foods across the board throughout the lifespan.  Though sure high protein might be related to hotspots low protein can be related to a host of other issues that your average young Berner might deal with.  Simplified pieces of advice like lt protein and lt fat make opaque a variety of concerns any owner might have especially when the highend dog food market is largely saturated with foods that have far more than  protein.,bernesemountaindogs,cghaens,1,t5_2sx7v

2345452,0,t3_2m7djk,When our Berner was a puppy our trainer recommended clipping his leash on while at the park multiple times rewarding him for sitting still and behaving and then letting him off to play again. The rationale was that the leash clipping signaled the end of fun time so he was likely to act out. Perhaps that would help?,bernesemountaindogs,cm1ly2d,3,t5_2sx7v

4738769,0,t1_ctrs17s,Its considerably more that our golden. The stuff is everywhere. We vacuum high traffic areas daily more if the dogs get rowdy. Darwins hair composition is different as well. It seems to be less dense so it floats around more but Im not sure if this is true for all berners. Also his black hair contrasts with everything so its more obvious. As long as we dont miss any brushings it seems to help a lot. ,bernesemountaindogs,ctrv6gy,1,t5_2sx7v

8763272,0,t3_5029h3,My Berner is smart... too smart. He gets bored with things fairly quick and then will pretend he doesnt hear you. Hes kind of a jerk that way. Took lots of cookies to get him through training. And Im glad we did train him because hes a goddamned nutcase. No one needs a  untrained wrecking ball in their home!Also he sings and chatters and talks... a lot. Ive never had such a vocal dog before. But he doesnt howl Ive even tried to get him to watch wolf documentaries and nothing he just barks and chatters to the TV. My Berner is weird and quirky but hes my buddy boy and I love him. And dont get me started on my Newf!,bernesemountaindogs,d712jl5,3,t5_2sx7v
