Then you go to target.com and order the tie fighter to have it shipped to the store with the clearance price for in store pickup.  When you go to pick up the item the price will change to the clearance price.    The drawback is that there might not be a store within driving distance that had the price on clearance.   One person was able to go on in store chat and get them to match the clearance price.  But that might take a bit more patience and not guaranteed.  ,starwarscollecting,cz18n13,1,t5_2zgrw

My favorite childhood toy was LEGO and I had mostly Classic Space stuff that my friends and I would use to construct and recreate scenes from the Star Wars movies.

I remember hunting ATATs and Millennium Falcons that were going for  each.   I ended up with two of each of them one to keep stashed and one to display.  I still have my loose display pieces even to this day but sadly I fell on dark times around the year  so I sold off a large chunk of my MISB ship collection.   Never got rid of any of the carded figures though.Had it out of the attic a few years ago contemplating on selling.

You buy a figure you have been searching for for at least a little cheaper than the  dollars most companys on Amazon want for it. You finally find it. You wait a month and a half all the while slowly realizing it might be fake... and then it is. So you go to return it and they email you to not say anything trying to shut me up by giving me my money back and saying keep the figure. Nope! Not gunna let anyone elses time be waisted.
