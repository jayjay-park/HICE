I think the hardest part for people who are trying to quit working is just letting go of the attached security that comes with a job.I like that you know exactly what makes you happy. I think that knowing people are happy with what Im doing also makes me happy. And thats something I dont get out of my current work.,Howtoquitworking,cs2iqzh,3,t5_38l67

I think it will eventually become more hands off but starting any business is time consuming. I do find it hard to do it some nights because it gets pretty boring by yourself but the only passion I have is making money and not getting fat. I dont have a passion for land but I do have a passion for my time. ,Howtoquitworking,ctkmwxp,1,t5_38l67
