61112,0,t3_1ur6bh,I had made this a while back and thought it was interesting. Biedrins and Rush for Thornton and Thompson. Biedrins is kinda rotting with the Jazz and I think he is still serviceable and could give us the ability to actually play big for short stints if we needed to putting Demarcus Williams or Landry at PF. Rush isnt that great of an addition but hes a shooting guard so we wouldnt lose too much in our depth. The biggest gain by this though is the contracts. We get out from under Thompson and Thorntons contract and Biedrins and Rush end their contract after this year. If neither of them work out we can get rid of them. I think the Jazz might also take it since Jason Thompson is still a pretty good player just in a system that doesnt really suit him and Thornton well hes Thornton. Maybe we can convince them to gamble on him and use him as a teacher for Hayward. The big problem though is that Utah doesnt really need another PF and Thompson has the worst contract out of all of them. He is cheaper than Williams though if there is a chance that they were thinking of dropping him next year.,kings,celdz1m,2,t5_2rqrs

If we somehow get the  pick and can get Embid then we are solid but if not Im not sure who we could draft. As far as the draft goes all I got to say is this DINT DRAFT MARCUS SMART!A key free agent we could go after to improve defensively is Deng he is a free agent this year and would be a good fit for us but thats only if Rudy opts out of his contract. I like Deng because he is a perimeter player who can knock down s but isnt needing the ball all the time to score freeing up Isaiah and DeMarcus to get more touches. Hes also a stingy defender which is exactly what we need along with just being an experienced veteran who could emerge as a leader in the locker room.,kings,chirb6o,3,t5_2rqrs

1292215,0,t3_28utw8,Team strength is definitely building up to a level we can be once again proud of. The kings as of now are still going to be work in progress mode. The future very much lies with what happens with our draft pick at number  and whether or not we sign Isaiah Thomas to a deal. Our team is weak at the PF position when it comes to defense and the SG position is under development with the addition of rookie Ben Mclemore. The one and only constant on this team is that Demarcus Cousins is absolutely dominant in his position. The future all lies with who we put around Demarcus the future could be very bright if we get the magical combination to complement Demarcus and be able to have an offense when he is off the floor.Another place of concern for the kings would have to be shot blocking and just defense as a whole. sorry my answer is all over the place... im currently sitting in class bored out of my mind   ,kings,ciezokp,3,t5_2rqrs

Yes he is he was  in the league in BPG ahead of Dwight and Drummond.  gt Hes simply a dude who clogs up the paint and gets rebounds at a rate good but not as good as Cousins. His rebounding is actually pretty poor barely good enough to be top  in the league for RBG at . per game.  He may not be Al Jefferson but we arent exactly in the market for another offensive powerhouse to pair with BoogieGay.  gt And since he cant hit a shot outside of  feet hed clog the paint for any of our slashers or for Cousins to work his magic around the rim. I just dont like the fit.Weve got players like Stauskas McCallum Ellington provided we dont trade him and occasionally Rudy to stretch the floor.

Over the next few years we will build into a playoff team due to the commitment of Vivek. I love that man already and I see him stumbling and making mistakesthats how business works and overcoming those mistakes is what makes a good businessman and hes a very successful business man and then learning from them which will propel us into being a great team again.Who knows we could hit a home run this year if a lot of our players step up their defensive game and meld together as a team. Or we could get rondo in a crazy trade and just start winning.I think the most fun thing about the kings right now is that who knows factor. Winning isnt important for me right now because we are recovering from years of mismanagement and poor spending which cumulatively dug us into a deeper and deeper hole.

I think thats ridiculous given how hard theyve been working night in and night out.  Also saying that they shouldnt have emotional or off nights because they are talented being paid a ton and in the NBA is not reasonable expectations.  The bottom line is that these are a bunch of young guys who are really really good at basketball going against of other guys who are really really good at basketball every night.  Its easy to say that they should be professional but running up and down a court at a fast pace for  minutes and remaining completely composed is a very hard thing to do no matter what kind of shape a person is in.  I guess my point is its one thing to root for these guys to do well and its a whole other to legitimately be angry at them for struggling.  Theyre just a bunch of young guys who are trying to do an extremely difficult job with a lot of critical eyes on them.  Theyre going to make mistakes no reason to lose all hope in their chances at winning games going forward.  ,kings,clz1t9w,3,t5_2rqrs

Theres a logic behind defense oriented teams having slower paces it gives fewer possessions per game  which means less chances to score.  He wants us to magically run with a roster that is best suited for running and ALSO play better D with a team that has average defenders at most positions? Theres a reason strategy wise why we were winning with Malone and its pretty much the best chance we had for success. So now were looking at the guy who built the roster firing a coach who had us winning when healthy and then tell us he wants this style that wont win? How is that acceptable? Theres no way they looked at this situation and thought yea we can still compete with coach Corbin and style. Lets fire Malone. However if somehow they did then theres no way in hell I trust him to get us into the playoffs. He has to be giving up on this year... ,kings,cnfv0a8,1,t5_2rqrs

4342513,0,t1_csf3djv,I disagree that he hasnt had consistent playing time. He was our starting PG for most of the nd half of the season. He started all  games that he played after the AllStar break and averaged  mpg and his numbers were not impressive to me. ppg . rpg . apg. He shot  from p which is just barely above breakeven.  overall from the field. Hes a  FT shooter. Hes just not that good. He was a . overall which I will say doesnt mean much because the team sucked but he definitely didnt make us better.I think we can do better than Ray for our backup PG. I wouldnt be mad if we kept him but I wouldnt be happy either. Hes not impressive to me. The fact that hes  actually makes it worse imo because he should be further along in his development by now.I certainly do not think that Ray McCallum should have any bearing whatsoever on whether we draft Mudiay or not. I would dump Ray for Mudiay so quick I wouldnt remember his time here at all.I think getting a nd round pick for Ray would be great especially a high nd Round pick. Theres a lot of talent in the nd Round and we can realistically pick up a good or great player. Look at all the top guys in the NBA that were nd Round picks. Hell  of the top  Free Agents this summer were  nd Round picks Marc Gasol DeAndre Jordan Paul Millsap Draymond Green and Danny Green. Wes Matthews wasnt even drafted! Tons of cheap talent to be had in the nd Round. We lost our nd Round pick this year also so as of right now we have only one pick but tons of holes in our roster.,kings,csf4rjs,1,t5_2rqrs

4508418,0,t3_3ctq21,Adelman always did a great job working with the varying skill sets of his players.You have to adapt to the team you have he says. Everybody talks about a system. Your system has to be able to adjust to the talent you have.San Antonios Gregg Popovich has shown that. His team now is totally different than it was before. Good coaches adjust to the players because its a players league not a coaches league. I dont care who you are if you have bad talent youre not going to win in the league.How did Adelman do it?By understanding every player is different he says. You dont treat everybody the same. There are some players who accept more discipline. Other players will not allow you to call them out in front of the team or in the newspaper. You have to put the players in a position where they feel they can succeed and the team can succeed too. If you can win theyll buy into it.Thats a hard thing nowadays. Many players have an entourage. Its not one agent sometimes its four agents. Its family and friends and hangerson. Everybody has an influence. You have to figure out how to deal with that. The only way you can is to form a relationship with the player where he trusts you. Otherwise hes not going to listen to you after awhile.Adelman did a marvelous job of getting his players to buy in. He got the most out of players who had feuded with other coaches players such as Rod Strickland and Webber and Latrell Sprewell. A rare exception was Tim Hardaway whom he had trouble with at Golden State.I blame a lot of that on myself Adelman says. I went from the Trail Blazer job where everything broke well for us until the end when they fired me but it was a great scenario. When I went to the Warriors I listened to people I shouldnt have listened to instead of doing it how I felt it should be done. I alienated Tim got on his bad side and it was hard to turn that back around. We ended up trading him and making other trades and it didnt work out.I learned my lesson. If youre going to succeed youd better figure out a way to get along with your main players. For the most part I was able to do that. ,kings,csyxoq9,4,t5_2rqrs

I just signed on with the organization and he invited not only me but my family. My yearold daughter Mia was able to come. She ended up doing a book report on the whole trip. Going to the Wailing Wall visiting the Dead Sea staying at the King David Hotel  the whole experience was unbelievable. I didnt know what to expect. It was something on my bucket list  to visit the Holy Land the land where Jesus walked. And he picked up the tab for everything.gt Hes an icon over there said Butler. A guy who embodies everything they stand for. Hes real mature for his age and has a great understanding of life. What I mean by life is he understands its about peoples lives and legacy.

7183059,0,t1_d1ub6f4,Thats exactly what they did this year and the team responded by winning  games.Part of the reason why all of our shooters have been so bad this year is because of the fact that Rondo is not a shooting threat! It allows defenses to sag off him on the perimeter and focus on defending our offball shooters on the perimeter more than they would if we had a PG who could shoot himself.Have you noticed that nearly every shot Bellinelli took this year was on the run? Lots of fadeaways and the like. Its because his man is able to stay RIGHT ON HIM because they dont have to worry about helping to defend Rondo at the perimeter. So we have better shooters than we did last year but they get fewer open looks because the guy passing them the ball is not a threat to shoot it himself unlike Isaiah Thomas or even Darren Collison.,kings,d1ung2o,1,t5_2rqrs

Collison is a great fit for the Thibs style of offense.  We need multiple ampD wings no matter who the new coach is.

If theres anything thats killing the activity of this sub its the massive cocktease of this year is our year Kings fans! the Kings org had been doing since .EDIT Just to add more to uJofais argumentgt I disagree with this particular decision so I think we need a new set of mods that agree with me.When CeJeh got banned people spun it to where SacUp was banning people left and right for disagreeing with him. Like what? When SacUp made the decision to ban DMC trade threads from nonkings fans it evolved to WE CANT HAVE DISSENTING OPINIONS HERE ANYMORE CAUSE SACUP IS A NAZI. When OP posted that legendary thread awhile back we all asked for proof or instances of where that actually happened but no one seems to be bothered to go find any. So the complainers have time to go articulate an argument for change because of abuse but when asked about where the abuse comes from they just magically dont have the time and reply with oh everyone else can see the problem. People get so antsy during the offseason its annoying. Is this a perfectly moderated sub? No its not. There are issues that persists but people like to make a big deal about the little things.

Also we basically have a big rotation right now and I would have liked to round that out with another solid big and worry about filling guards with our other picks or in FA although youre right pulling in any good free agents will be tough.  Having a solid backup for Willie or having the option to package Koufos in a trade for something would be better than having two guys who likely wont amount to much and a guy whos staying in Europe at least in my opinion.  ,kings,d4ll2ye,0,t5_2rqrs

8077497,0,t3_4pqln2,Every draft people start to slot in the new rookies into rotation roles for the next season. A lot of the time that doesnt happen. Sometimes they cant contribute for a year or two. Theyre thinking long term for the first time in a while. What happens if Demarcus leaves in two years? We shouldnt expect Papagiannis to be very good until then. Same with Skal. Both will get plenty of time in the DLeague too if necessary. So I dont really agree that the front court is clogged. If they move Koufos and presumably dont resign Quincy Acy they come into the season with the exact number of bigs they had last year. Theres  mpg between them for the two rooks. Are we expecting those two to combine for  mpg of NBA level play? Thats very optimistic.And if they actually are good? GREAT! Why the hell is everyone treating that like its a bad thing? Even getting a role player at  is a good pick. Those are assets for a team that has been bereft of them for a long time. Im concerned that they didnt pick Baldwin D Murray or Luwawu among others. But using the draft to address immediate issues has been a problem for this franchise. Im happy to seem them thinking longterm.

You could do similar things for every player in the league. LeBron is the best player of my lifetime and sometimes he gets lazy and doesnt run back on defense. Sometimes Kobe took lazy contested fadeaways instead of putting in the effort to get a good shot for him or his teammates. Sometimes MJ did dumb or lazy things. All players do this. Basketball players are imperfect.People are hypercritical of Boogie in particular. Dont know if thats some issue of inherent bias intellectual laziness dont know who to blame so they just blame him or something else but its definitely the case. Which is not to say that Boogie is perfect or unworthy of criticism but to act like hes the reason for our failures is frankly idiotic. Hes our best offensive player based on individual stats and team impact and outside of Temple our best defensive player. Dude does everything on the court with very little help around him.

Ty Lawson and DC are both FA this offseason who will be expecting to be paid and are at their best when they come off the bench? Are you okay with giving them both a large contract that would hurt our cap flexibility? Or even letting one walk for free?What are options for our SF going forward? Casspi is gone this offseason and he doesnt even fit on this team. Barnes is to old to rely on to play starter minutes. Id be ecstatic if we draft Tatum or Issac but we know Joerger philosophy with rookies. Take a look at this FA class for Sf its terrible unless youre happy with Jeff Green.

WallBealPorter is going to eat up a huge portion of their cap and their other deals like Mahimi handicap their ability to do anything big.  The other likely team to make a play is probably the Lakers.  If they want to go after both George and Cousins they likely need to clear some contracts but even still I would put them as the most likely non Pelican team.  I think the Pelicans are a nice spot for him he will be the b player on the team behind AD who is a guy by all accounts he is very friendly with due to OlympicKentucky connections.I think its more than just the not wanting to trade away assets when they could sign him in FA issue. I think teams are legitimately afraid to take on the risk of his personality.  It isnt like teams had to really sell the farm to beat the Pelicans offer.  ,kings,deij9a7,1,t5_2rqrs

He watches too much happen instead of being active. Everything seems a little half assed with him sometimes except his passing which has been great lately. Just watch him do pick and rolls. He rarely ever actually picks the guy he just makes a move to then rolls. Defenses know this so the guard the roll and dont even show for the pick. ,kings,df6dxli,19,t5_2rqrs

11356847,0,t1_dfj7w6o,You make fair points. As for trading the big men he didnt do so earlier since Embiid was still question mark. If Embiid didnt get healthy and show us franchise player potential we would have to cut our losses with him and stick with OkaforNoel. From a draft perspective the th pick is a  chance of being a role player at best So yeah MCW is awful and his stats were inflated with us. But at least Hinkie was able to evaluate him enough to see that at the time unlike most Sixer fans ROTY voters and apparently at least the Bucks GM and was savvy enough to get the much better Lakers pick for him giving us a better shot at landing a star player.And if we are looking at talent evaluation then theres no reason to limit it to the lottery. Finding players like Holmes nd Grant nd Covington DLeague McConnell undrafted are all examples of him being a pretty good evaluator of talent.I agree with you though that thinking about why KP didnt want to come and Silver intervening are fair points to consider when discussing whether Hinkie is a good GM overall and if The Process is worth undertaking as a whole.,kings,dfja0bl,1,t5_2rqrs

11573473,0,t1_dg7uknt,Towns is their Center of the future. They have Wiggins and Lavine locked in at SFSG. They have Rubio and Dunn who can run point. They need a PF to fit next to Towns that can stretch the floor. Markkanen would be great for them. Williams blocks shots and grabs rebounds but he doesnt do much else for them. Towns already has Dieng playing next to him who is more versatile than Williams and look how bad theyve been this year. I could see Williams being perfect for them if he is able to develop a consistent jumpshot but I dont see any evidence of that being imminent at this time. He shot  from p range and shot  from FT. Thats not a good sign. Markkanen is a legit athletic footer that shot  from p this year and has demonstrated an ability to put the ball on the floor and drive the lane. He has the potential to be an excellent offensive player and he has the athleticism and size to be at least a decent supplemental defender.
