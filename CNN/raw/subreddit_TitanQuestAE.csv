9432780,0,t3_59sunk,Yeah pets have a hard time in act . Dont worry though they get huge boosts to damage and HP once you reach Epic and once again in Legendary.For now Id suggest reallocating your points to something like that. Eruption will be your main damage dealer Volcanic Orb will stun ennemies and Hearth of Oak will boost your health. Good pierce resistance helps too against those pesky act  archers.I realize its probably not in the spirit of your build you seem to love pets but it is very hard to make it work in act . You can always put back your points when you reach Epic.,TitanQuestAE,d9bo4n4,1,t5_3g4r2
