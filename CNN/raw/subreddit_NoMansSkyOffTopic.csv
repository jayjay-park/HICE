5370983,0,t3_3olds0,Im not expecting it to happen but the latest Amazon shipping estimate notices are definitely intriguing. It could just be an error on their part though. Its interesting that none of the other Amazons have done it although it could be that the games will really ship on that day and they just werent supposed to send out emails yet.It would make sense why they did Colbert and the Its a secret answer would make more sense I know Colbert used the term first but I also wouldnt be surprised if that little exchange was discussed beforehand. I gave various reasons on the main sub as to why the game might still be coming out this year and those still hold up. I would think theyd still want to give a week or so notice to people instead of just dropping it on the th but who knows?Anyways do I think its coming? Probably not. Will I pay attention as the th rolls around? Definitely.,NoMansSkyOffTopic,cvy7c33,2,t5_3a8zl
5447805,0,t1_cw7zvqd,I got bored of GW really quickly. Im a fan of most MMOs. Ive enjoyed WoW FFARR SWTOR and even Ragnarok Online and The Secret World. But GW never held my interest past a couple of days.,NoMansSkyOffTopic,cw80d04,1,t5_3a8zl
