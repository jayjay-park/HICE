10075049,0,t1_dbksk5v,First of all Im always interested in rewrites. Thats one of the best things about poetry.Second.. I know that poetry by its very nature breaks rules. And good poetry breaks rules for a reason. There is a distinction between the two. If youre breaking rules just to do it with nothing to say then its kind of like verbal vandalism lol anyway. Its not that it didnt make sense to me its that the imagesfeelings being presented were all packaged in a way that it has been packaged before. Edit and that the poem seemed to center around being able to rhyme as opposed to being able to express your feelings in a way that rhymes if that makes any sense lol. Honestly just tryin to help. Ive gone through so many workshops that it probably sounds like me just bein a Dick though and I understand that. But I also know the only way I ever grew as a writer was being challenged on my own writing and why I chose certain words. One of my biggest problems was putting sound before meaning. Id make it rhyme eve of it didnt fit what I was trying to say ya dig?,Best_Poetry,dbkstvs,1,t5_31bm0
