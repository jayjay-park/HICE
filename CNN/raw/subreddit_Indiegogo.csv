1061419,0,t1_cho6353,Exactly what happened to me. Im really disappointed to see that its only  funded with  days to go. I hate to say it but its there video its not great. The second video the one I assume someone else made and sent them thats the one that could make it go viral. Maybe the can try again on kickstarter if it doesnt work.,Indiegogo,choxrvz,1,t5_2t0e9

It can change how eager they are to enforce and what you get hit with but they can still hit you with a Cease and Desist despite you not doing this explicitly for monetary profit. What happens if you get your target backer amount and get hit with a CampD the next day? Are you just going to walk away with that money so sad too bad?Are any of the industry pros you had respond IPcopyright lawyers? Seriously go talk to one. ,Indiegogo,d0bnkmw,1,t5_2t0e9
