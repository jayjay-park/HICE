18565,0,t1_ceggsqw,Does he not seem to fucking understand that having no cap nothing to stop the top owners from spending money on foreign players is one of the reasons why we DIDNT have a top flight league in America until ? Its like he doesnt remember the fucking NASL existed back then and folded. If owners can spend as much money as they want you think theyre going to bother with the mediocre to piss poor American players some teams have? Fuck no. Theyre going to go out and bring in foreign players to replace them.Alexoobers is right. The players union will get the cap raised a bit but NOTHING like johanspot is arguing for. Because youd think they understand this shit. If they raise the cap too high or even just abolish the cap that gets a LOT of the players replaced by foreign talent. ,MLS,cegjp0i,2,t5_2rbnb

20492,0,t3_1ucldz,I would like to see a sizable but reasonable increase in the salary cap and the transition towards a soft salary cap with a graduated luxury tax.  By a graduated luxury tax I imagine something analogous to federal income tax where the more money a team spends above the cap a greater portion must be distributed to the league as a whole.  The distributed money should be in the form of allocation dollars that can be used without impacting the cap.  Someone with better knowledge of the leagues and individual teams finances would have to decide what tax rates would work best but in my opinion the rates should become prohibitively harsh quickly in order to prevent teams from blowing other teams spending out of the wateror if a team does so much money would be distributed to the league that the competitive advantage of spending more on ones own roster is diminished.I know the luxury tax hasnt done a great job of maintaining spending equality in MLB but that is mainly because the tax in baseball is more punitive than it is progressive.  Considering that generally only  or  teams per year exceed the threshold and few are even capable of approaching the very high threshold not much revenue is actually generated through the tax and of what revenue is generated it has little or nothing to do with improving the rest of the league relative to the taxed team the money is invested to grow the league as a whole but not necessarily improve equality.  Lastly since the MLB salary threshold is already so high that half of the teams pay less than  of it even if the tax were redistributed to the lower teams it would have little to no impact on parity.The idea I propose takes advantage of MLSs unique situation.  In a league like MLS with such a low salary cap every team is capable of at least coming very close to the salary cap.  For  there will be about  teams NYCFC NYRB Seattle LA Toronto MiamiOrlando capable of greatly exceeding the salary cap and who would probably be willing to do so even with a heavy tax due to the amount their resources exceed what they are allowed to spend.  If  of the league is capable of paying a lot into a graduated luxury tax there would be a lot of revenue generated that could be passed to the other .  Considering that every team is already right at the salary cap it wouldnt be too hard to adjust the tax structure such that heavily spending teams would not be able to outspend greatly the less endowed teams.  I imagine this system would mitigate the problem where a  DP team is not able to fund serviceable players and subs in all positions while also allowing less endowed teams to start grabbing some DPs or better filling their squads too.,MLS,cegrl86,6,t5_2rbnb

Did you see the defense Chivas USA FO trotted out in front of the cameras?  It was a travesty. Dont forget that Chivas USAs fans  and leaguefans everywhere  orchestrated a very public protest against Chivas USAs owner.  Never before has so much fan coordination effort and money gone into the protesting of a team  or the league. Questionable Trades.  Think RogersMagee was a controversial trade?

My wisdom when it comes to soccer isnt much more than  or  years so Im still relatively new to this as a fan.why would you rather create a league of  over having a second league within and then allow relegation?   seems like big number. The BPL has . La Liga is . Serie A is . This may also force teams to be keeping or buying better players keeping things competitive.this may also lend itself to having something more in stone and official than the NASL and others as a second league. Better managed league may attract more people from within the states and outside to it that level. never seen a game just picked this notion up from others on here Just was curious so I may learn more and possibly change my preconceived notions.,MLS,cejpozn,0,t5_2rbnb

Ronaldo has  goals in the past two large format tournaments. Postiga was a far more clutch player in quals until the playoff against Sweden which is a relatively favorable draw for them. of the  goals they have scored in WC and Euro  they only came against  teams. Portugal is not an easy match up for us by any stretch of the imagination but they are not a European powerhouse team. they are a middling European club that will be a challenge for us but one that the US can rise to. its in no way insane to think we can draw with them. if Northern Ireland and Israel can so can the US.Ghana too is within the realm of possibility. yeah our history isnt great but again id say we were more outmanaged than outplayed in .

304784,0,t3_1xkpfb,Heading a soccer ball is not going to injure any player with a fullydeveloped cranium even with bad technique. So I agree with the recommendations that younger players probably dont need to be heading the ball at all  most of them cant do it properly anyway so its no big loss to the game. However I dont know that theres been any documented cases of young players being injured simply by performing a soccer header.The issues with heading are that when challenging another player for the ball in the air elbows knees arms and heads are banging in to the players head at high speed and that definitely is a problem. To be clear the problem isnt with heading itself its really just incidental contact when challenging in the air.Goalkeepers are getting knocked around badly when diving for the ball or just being run into by other players regardless of whether a heading technique is involved at all. Players and GKs running in to the goal posts seems to be a minor problem as well but again the problem isnt with heading its with contact with the head by nonsoccerballs.Im seeing more and more players wear protective headgear including an entire team of U girls and the occasional male player here and there. Im all for it and with a little more research in to the types of head injuries encountered by soccer players a very good headgear could certainly be developed.I dont think theres anything that we can do to protect goalkeepers short of full on hockey goalkeeper gear. ,MLS,cfccwkl,3,t5_2rbnb

Also in the Fires lease it says that if Bridgeview goes bankrupt which right now is a strong possibility the Fire are released from the lease and can either buy the stadium outright from Bridgeview or just leave. And given the Fires poor attendance recored since theyve moved to Toyota Park and how likely Bridgeview will go down the shitter if it goes banckrupt the Fire have a strong possibility of leaving.,MLS,cgb9dza,3,t5_2rbnb

634088,0,t1_cgbmucl,This is the first year in well ever that I have paid this much attention to MLS.  I am a relatively new soccer fan but in about  I started to pay the smallest amount of attention to EPL.  Then almost exclusively International.  But over the last few years my love of USMNT started growing into watching more forms of soccer but with it came a skepticism of MLS and its value because everywhere I looked seemed to say so and so needs to get out of MLS to make it or If  can secure a move to Europe he will be great. so on and so forth.  But starting last year that view has shifted and in my own opinion it is no longer necessary.  In trying to follow US development and just in general the player pool I have started to pay more and more attention to MLS and its got me excited that the league is growing and steadily improving.I hope it truly is Garbers legacy that he helped build it up to levels we have yet to see and a level where fans no longer argue about whether or not a veteran playing here means his career with the national team is declining or done for.  ,MLS,cgcch99,1,t5_2rbnb

The rivalry comes in the difference between the people in the cities Buffalo sees itself as Bruce Springsteen hard working blue collar type people and sees Toronto as a Justin Bieber type pop star while Toronto sees itself as a  star restaurant and Buffalo as a cockroach infested greasy diner.That is also why I think if by some miracle Buffalo got a mls team it would have a great rivalry with Toronto ,MLS,cgkimvr,3,t5_2rbnb

843822,0,t1_ch04wmf,Yeah Ive been hearing a lot of optimism about this aspect but Im not sure it is going to be that much better than previous cups. I just checked ESPNs broadcast schedule I see lots of  AM PST kickoff times all the way through the quarterfinals and since that is the listed time which normally allows for  minutes of pregame hype Im guessing it means the actual kickoff is  AM. Thats pretty early to expect casual fans to tune it especially considering most of them will be at work and still trying to wake up and get their morning coffee. Even on the east coast that is still before lunch hour so it is gonna be hard to get the casual fans to jump in right out of the gate. But it is still better than Germany or S. Africa with  AM PST kick off times. and the latest games starting at like  PM. Im a pretty hardcore fan and I was unemployed during the last cup but I still missed a lot of matches just because I couldnt drag myself out of bed and stay awake through   AM matches every damn day. The good news is that it will mean that at least some of the later games will fall into primetime viewing hours in the USA at least on the east coast. The later of each days group stage matches will be at  PST EST and that includes the USAs first two group stage matches against Ghana and Portugal. No matter what time zone you are in and what kind of hours you work you should be able to catch at least some of the big matches without taking time off work or getting up before sunrise. It was a lucky break that it works out great how the USA gets the latest slot for their first two. ,MLS,ch072eo,1,t5_2rbnb

Barrera was constantly being called a thread by SJs unbearable homer of an announcer but as much as Barerra was giving Gorlitz fits on the dribble his crosses on the end of those dribbles were atrocious.  It didnt matter if SJ could defend well against crosses or not and you couldnt tell from the plays because Barrera couldnt produce many crosses that needed defending.I think Wondo is dropping deep because he seems like the only player on the field other than Bernardez and Goodson who is actually making passes that create opportunities or relieve pressure Salinas opens things up on the dribble but not with his passes and Djalos sample size is too small right now.  In  pretty much the whole SJ starting XI save for Salinas in the final third and Hernandez all the time had the ability to control possession really well when they were on their game and Wondo had early service options from both Baca and Beita.  No one other than Wondo seems to be manifesting anything like that kind of passing vision for SJ just yet this season.  If Wondo could play with the likes of Dempsey Higuain or RSLs Morales hed probably have way more joy playing off the shoulder of the last defender than he is now at SJ.  Wondo used to just thrive off of throughballs but now hes having to settle for getting on the end of corners and crosses from wide or just latching onto loose balls in the box.  SJ just simply do not have the creativity and passing vision in the midfield especially centrally and they havent had it since Dawkins left and Baca lost form.Also when opposing defenses plan to face SJ limiting Wondos opportunities to sneak behind the central defenders is their  priority.  I think one of the primary ways of doing this is to keep the defenders deep.  They let Wondo drop into midfield to play the ball.  SJ gets to build up an attack that way but they also get to get numbers back as well and it at least keeps them from being struck by Wondo running in behind off their blindside and beating the offside trap for a on with the keeper.  It is working for them because SJ doesnt have enough attacking threat in the central midfield.  Koval is a DMid.  Cronin is a DMid. Pierazzi is a DMid even Khari is really just a DMid.  Unless you count Tommy Thompson who has yet to play a single competitive minute of his professional career SJ does not have a single playmaking central midfielder attacking midfielder or .,MLS,ch67udt,3,t5_2rbnb

936652,0,t1_chaq2q5,I see what youre getting at with seeing the Energy ownership group as the bad guys.  And youre not totally wrong.  But you have a key fact wrong.  Expansion to the NASL was not the primary intention of either ownership group.  And this turns out to be a very important fact in why the situation got so messy.When the first group started the USLPDL club their goal was to eventually upgrade the team to the USLPro.  And importantly they signed a noncompete agreement with the USL to not start an NASL team in OKC in the future.  Eventually the Energy group swooped in with a much stronger offer to the USL to start a USLPro team.  It was only after this point that the original group announced plans to start an NASL team.  The USL threatened legal action on the basis of the noncompete agreement.  This forced the NASL group to back off which is why the Energy got such a big head start in forming their club.So while you may have a point in thinking the Energy group were being jerks and one could argue that they just had a better planoffer the USL always had first dibs on OKC.,MLS,char3p9,6,t5_2rbnb

Formerly you had defenders who were more focused on power over speed and would stay back near the goal to further fortify defense and to punt the ball up for a potential quick goal on change of possession.  Nowadays the strategy is and it is a much better one in my opinion is to move the team further forward and rely on possession and set pieces around the opponents goal.  This requires a faster more possession oriented back line.  I hope that I answered your question.

I would love to see an analysis of where the MLS is financially now and how the deal will change things.  One thing is probably a given the MLS will now be able to afford to pay more for the talent on the field.  Up until this point less rich teams like SJ have struggled to keep their squad together once theyve put a good one together.  SJs  success season was built in part on the excellent work of two draftpick fullbacks in Beitashour and Morrow.  In  both players are playing at other MLS clubs because SJ cant afford what they are worth once theyve proved themselves.Of course that is just one aspect.  Also the league as a whole will be able to keep more of its homegrown talent in the league.

He said it twice though so I really hope hes just using that as a nickname for the yettobenamed team.,MLS,chiaddw,2,t5_2rbnb

EJ hasnt seemingly been giving his all for DC and with his comments about his teammates he didnt help himself in impressing Klinsmann.Regardless EJ is a talented player but he shot himself in the foot this time.

In addition the ref wouldnt catch every one of them either so you would not have a red in every game.If that kind of thing were happening every game the refs being diligent about issuing red cards would be an important part of deterring that sort of thing.,MLS,ci42hw7,1,t5_2rbnb

1198556,0,t1_ci4eh7i,There arent many because the culture itself is different. Our clubs arent franchises and in most countries the location isnt the defining factor when choosing which team to support. Its more about values and tradition or family history. Because the contries are infinitely smaller in most european countries  or  of the people support two or three of the biggest clubs regardless of how far from the stadium they are. I can give you my example Benfica and Porto are two of the three biggest clubs in portuguese soccer historically and the two strongest teams in the last decades. I live about  or  miles away from Porto stadium but I support Benfica that plays its home games  miles away from me.And this is not right or wrong we are just wired in different ways. Thats why I cant understand a New Yorker supporting a team just because its from NY even if it happens to be a marketing stunt to sell energy drinks.About those namings its still different when its a local company that probably actually cares about the local team or some austrian company trying to get its share in the worlds biggest city.,MLS,ci4gfam,1,t5_2rbnb

1202063,0,t1_ci4t82h,BB may have had a pretty settled system that he brought to the  WC but it was often offensively limited.Also having a settled system that you never really deviate from is not necessarily a good thing.  Spain get a lot of praise for their possession dominating tactics but have also failed to show an ability to adjust their approach when the opposing team counters the possession game with a bunkered defense.JK has experimented a little and it looks like the experiments with the diamond formation were a sort of failure but this US team has recently successfully employed a  Nigeria  WCQ and  also WCQ and  Gold Cup at various times.  The fact that this US side seems flexible enough to approach games differently and employ the tactics that best suit the players available and the opposition is arguably a pretty good benefit.Looking at performances it may be tricky to compare the tactics of the two sides.  This is arguably the most talented US team ever and IMHO is certainly the most complete US team Ive ever seen.  There are no apparent weak links in the starting lineup and many of the subs are quality as well.  Compare that to the  team that started players like Ricardo Clark and Robby Findley and you realize that the  squad will be better able to make the most of good tactics and to overcome poor tactics.,MLS,ci4umdq,3,t5_2rbnb

St. Pete has the advantage in this scenario because in all likelihood they will lose the Rays in the next few years.  The city is simply unwilling to throw down  million on a new baseball stadium  that the owner refuses to finance with personal money.  Edwards has stated publicly that HE would pay for the stadium itself out of his own pockets if the city would sell him the land where Al Lang is.  He has enough personal wealth for the franchise fee and the team is already established in a dream location downtown.  The big thing in their favor is  no one even plays baseball in that  year old stadium save for a few international games a year.Orlando is a success story and even though our supporters groups dont get along Im really happy they got an MLS franchise.

1358976,0,t1_cimmqce,Perhaps but I dont think it would have been as effective.  You have to bear in mind that there are several players on this roster that Bradley likely would not have had that we have because of Klinsmann.  Someone else said that this is an improved version of the style under Bradley and I agree.  I think the reason it improved is because of the quality of players Jurgen brought in and the way he motivated them.   You can say how much you want to change the style of a team completely around but you cant do that if you dont have the right players.  Were getting there but we arent there yet.   The cohesion of the attack especially during qualifying was far and away more impressive than anything Bradley ever had.  We were beginning to control the ball for long stretches.

Johnson got both hands to the ball but failed to catch or perry to the side instead giving the forward what  times would have been a tap in. made up for it yes.... but you have to notice what put him in that situation in the first place.This save was very similar to Clint Irwins and Tally Halls. But the main difference was Clint Irwin was at full stretch and didnt get a strong paw to it he was also no where near the goal line to perry it out anyway. He did well and also held onto the ball after he saved the nd shot. Hall had a slightly easier angle further to the side but managed to perry it out. Of the  saves Hall wins that duel in terms of safety why make  saves when  will do? and Irwins was close nd. I liked Hamids reaction save but at the end of the day I gotta go with that beautiful Jamaican beast Ricketts once again.

Next year more soccer on tv two new teams with really big names on their rosters will give MLS another bump rebranded Chivas tbd and cant forget the gold cup and womens world cup will give a little extra push next year too. maybe copa america too will help.Copa America in  will bring some hype once again to the second half of the season in a bit more direct way than the euro cup will. the olympics will bring some of the spotlight to our younger talent in europe and in mls. should bring in atlanta and miami into MLS so there is another bump there and who knows which players will be coming into the league. another gold cup and the confederations cup should get us more hyped for the world cup the following year. is the next world cup and with that comes another big rush of soccer fandom in the country and hopefully the sport league and usmnt get at least the same amount of new fans as this year. will bring another gold cup and womens world cup. I believe by this year MLS should be at  teams. no idea when the th team will really come out but im putting it in . this the th year you want to know about. we should have an average attendance around  in the MLS and that is comparable to the dutch and french leagues. right now its closer to . mls teams should be able to compete in ccl much better and im hopeful that the championship ccl game in  years will be  mls teams. tldr the growth will be a bit faster and a bit more noticeable than before because the next five years will be a pretty busy period in MLSs history,MLS,ciywqk4,3,t5_2rbnb

Literally every team in the league has one or two foreignborn players who are major contributors.Still the best known international players are probably Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill at RBNY and Robbie Keane in LA. There are however lots of other guys who arguably do more weekinweekout than those three.Right now the three leading scorers in MLS are two English guys  Bradley WrightPhillips NY and Dom Dwyer KC  and Erick Torres a Mexican at Chivas USA.If youre looking for an international player with a shot at being a true star and turning up at World Cups  Id say keep an eye on  Torres. Hes only  and will presumably head back to Mexico at some point to try to work his way into his national team.

As far as additional young players coming to MLS after major tournaments I think we are growing towards that and there have been some cases of that happening with players from Central and South America Gabriel Torres of Panama signed with the Colorado Rapids after his performance in the  Gold Cup international tournament for example.Overall though what is going to make the difference is money. The biggest leagues in the world are in Europe and as long as they can pay the highest salaries they will attract the best players. Since MLS has fairly low salary cap a mechanism to protect the league from bankruptcy and keep the teams on relatively equal footing Europe is going to have more power to draw star players than MLS will. As MLS gets bigger and gains more sponsors and TV money they just signed a new deal that will triple their TV revenue over the next  years they will come closer to being able to draw those bigger star players while still in their primes.,MLS,cizfw6n,4,t5_2rbnb

Because for me he definitely wouldnt be. And I think its fair to say that even if he does make your starting  hed be one of the least important players in it as EspindolaRolfeKitchenArnaudBoswellHamid have all had better seasons than he has and I could throw more in there but I think those  have unarguably been our most important this year.Now consider how much EJ gets paid compared to those  players I mentioned we start on page . There is no value for money. We would be in first even if we didnt have him. All hes doing is locking up a huge chunk of money that well need to resign young guys like HamidSilvaKitchen and replace guys like ArnaudRolfe when they eventually lose it. If we end up winning MLS cup and he scores a couple of crucial goals it wont matter how much hes paid but if we dont win anything his contract is going to look really bad next year especially if he still isnt a clear starter.He had a good game last night and I hope he keeps it up but I have been disappointed overall.,MLS,cj3e9po,1,t5_2rbnb

Read the Derek Boogaard piece from the New York Times or watch the corresponding documentary and youll see quotes from Boogaard and other goons blatantly saying that they were fighting for the sake of fighting not to police anybody.I have season tickets to proof that you can play elite competitive hockey without five for fighting and it wont turn into a cheap shot fiesta. In fact I see dirty play more frequently in the NHL where they have the best officials because of the cheapshotthenfightaboutit culture. If somebody takes a cheap shot on somebody else then fights thats not even a punishment. Theyll get applauded for fighting and they dont even have to go shorthanded! Remember Matt Cookes grand return to Boston? He didnt exactly get punished when he fought to answer to something that was irrelevant to the game at hand.If you remove the whole five for fighting thing players will still stand up for each other and fights will occasionally happen because thats the nature of a fast physical sport with collisions and people holding sticks. If you pay close attention we are slowly and I mean slowly getting closer to seeing that kind of fighting eliminated from the NHL.,MLS,cj3owac,2,t5_2rbnb

I personally hope that if he has a good offer from a top  side he takes it. While Yedlin can still improve in MLS hell do so much quicker under more internal and external competition.

The main reason Im trying to do this is that I would really like to follow MLS more closely and the only way I personally am really able to do that is through the lens of a fan or at least a follower of a particular team if that makes any sense. I have trouble following a league as a whole as an outside observer which is why for example I have trouble with the NBA.While Im not really home often I do my best to try and support soccer in my area I bought tickets and drove home last weekend for Man City v. AC Milan the first major soccer event weve had in  years and I have tickets for a Hounds game next week. I understand the regional pride aspect but as a Pittsburgher our regional pride is very isolated to our local area we have fierce rivalries and opposition to a team in almost every MLS city within approximately an eighthour drive notably Philadelphia Columbus New York DC and New England. ,MLS,cjb5x3f,1,t5_2rbnb

Im hoping that this signing means the end of Cronin more than anything. I think he is the one who loses out with this signing.

1583038,0,t1_cje14k2,This was already answered but Ill expand on it. The keeper goalie or what have you sets up his players in the wall. Again generally right at the  yard limit. A lot of things are taken into consideration when forming a wall for a free kick first is proximity to the goal and location of the kick be it directly in front of the goal on the edge of the box near the edge of the endline etc.... Proximity and location tell the keeper how many men will be in the wall. Next is how the team generally takes free kicks and how good the free kick taker is a team like LA during the Beckham years could try for a direct shot on goal or to try play the ball to someones head to score. Since LA was very capable of scoring by both means a wall and a man standing on a post of the goal if not both posts would be necessary. As you watch more youll start to see keepers setting up walls by standing alongside or directly in front of the post pointing left or right aiming the far side of the wall to a point which the keeper feels a curved shot cant bend low into the near post. Essentially the wall stands to make the shot as hard as possible allowing the keeper to cover as little area as is important.,MLS,cjepqsy,4,t5_2rbnb

Manchester United has won  titles since the league was founded in .   titles have gone to teams that just got bought by corrupt billionaires and then bought stacked teams.  The games are exciting as exhibitions but midbottom table teams are just a farm system for the top teams and theres no parity or system to encourage fair competition. The prorel system guarantees that half the teams are basically minor league competition because they are constantly getting booted from the league and being financially crippled.  Fans of mid table teams actually cheer against their own players because if they are too good theyll get poached.  Like I said the players are great the games are fun but the league itself as a competition is a huge bore.  I like leagues where every team has a shot on opening day.

They HAVE to hype up the game to get you to watch it. They cant really hype the local activities because youre not involved.Back to my point of them doing a poor job. I went down there Friday evening when it first opened. Things werent ready even the MLS store and fan experience booth wasnt setup in time. I went down Saturday around pm and the same thing except there were even less booths. Nothing down on the waterfront where it was less buy our stuff and more play this and participate in that. That stuff didnt open until Sunday and even then most booths were sticklers about opening at EXACTLY noon. The ATampT booth told us to come back in  minutes even though they were setup and just standing around. What made that even worse was the family bike pedal that started at am and finished around . All of those people left because nothing was open. I volunteered at the bike pedal and the people running it told us they didnt know how many people to expect because they only advertised it for the past week. My job was to wrangle local people that just happened to be biking on the waterfront.It was a fun weekend but they missed out on so many opportunities to attract more people because of bad planning.,MLS,cjiitxt,1,t5_2rbnb

He mostly just threw them out there and expected them to play it as an exhibition game. It wasnt his fault there were a few bad fouls and the ref let stuff go. Porter had no responsibility for that and yet Pep took his frustrations out on him. He embarrassed Porter because he could deflecting his anger onto someone who didnt deserve it. It was immature and classless and the reaction of this sub is perfectly reasonable. For the most part. ,MLS,cjja292,3,t5_2rbnb

A challenge thats rougher or less controlled than it needed to be but not quite to the point where youd need to issue a card for it.  No tactical value. A challenge that has no value to the game. We often hear about technical fouls in soccer and other sports the player accepts that hes committing a foul but knows that the penalty for the foul is less than the risk of what happens if they dont commit the foul. A cynical foul might be one that was done with some level of intent but had no such value. This often seems to be the case when a player starts to lose their cool in a game and lets frustration take over. ,MLS,cjs3g22,3,t5_2rbnb

The only way to bridge that gap is to sell players for a profit buy a better player sell him for a profit again and again until the entire league is filled with great players.

I am willing to bet that we didnt even get notice of this as a club.gt The allocation ranking is the mechanism used to determine which MLS club has first priority to acquire a U.S. National Team player who signs with MLS after playing abroad or a former MLS player who returns to the League after having gone to a club abroad for a transfer fee. The allocation rankings may also be used in the event two or more clubs file a request for the same player on the same day when the discovery period opens in December. The allocations will be ranked in reverse order of finish for the  season taking playoff performance into account. gt Once the club uses its allocation ranking to acquire a player it drops to the bottom of the list.  A ranking can be traded provided that part of the compensation received in return is the other clubs ranking. At all times each club is assigned one ranking. The rankings reset at the end of each MLS League season.From the official league source. He would have been amazing for us and we just got all that money from Giancarlo Gonzalez as well.

1755518,0,t3_2ekfa0,many reasons. the one I have to defend the most living in Los Angeles and surrounded by hardcore Galaxy fans is why not LA? I have a hard time rooting for assured winners in sports. Never been a fan of any team thats a Goliath I would almost always watch a David struggle towards an upset. Watching a Galaxy game that ends in defeat isnt ever a question of how did they win? but how could they lose? and thats never been as fun as rooting for an underdog you could probably argue that I could get just as much satisfaction cheering for Chivas USA but get real I do like seeing my team win every once in a while. secondly as I originally hail from Tampa I dont have a hometown team to root for postfolding of the Mutiny. I regularly cheer for the Rowdies and the green and gold coloring they share with the Timbers made them feel like a natural fit. I wasnt really following MLS at the time but  marked a huge year of change in my personal and professional life and when I learned that it meant the same to the Timbers it felt like another remarkable coincidence that cemented PTFC as the only club for me.

1764259,0,t1_ck1h9wi,I can think of several reasons why such a plan shouldnt be put in place.A. This second tier you propose to create is a guaranteed money loser relative to the first tier. Americans are notorious in their aversion to second tier professional sports. This is the reason why there is no fully professional second tier American football league despite the sports extreme popularity in the USA and it is the reason why second tier Basketball Hockey and Baseball leagues have remained on the very low end of the professional scale. Second tier pro leagues here attract very few viewers and very little money dont expect a big broadcast deal. MLS officials understand that if they create this second tier explicitly labelled Division MLS they will create a money pit. That league will not attract the ratings and the dollars necessary to make prorel between itself and MLS viable. Clubs shuffled from MLS to MLS will see rapid and substantial dips in their profitability and popularity. MLS officials know that because of this they have no incentive to create two clearly labelled tiers. It doesnt make any financial sense for them to do so because MLS would need to be subsidized and its clubs would underperform as a direct result of their being in a second tier.Rather if they ever do see the need to create two leagues it would be in their interest to label them in such a way that they appear to be at the same level just in different subleagues divisions conferences or whatever. Instead of taking on  lower division teams and creating a secondtier that will draw little interest they can create two leagues divided by geography or some other marker. Both leagues would be part of a broader MLS and ostensibly at the same level first tier leaving no room for prorel. The teams would compete in their own leagues and then the best of each would compete in the playoffs. MLS keeps its franchise system with salary cap intact a feat that would be substantially more difficult with prorel maximizes its profitability keeps all of the new markets in the first tier where they will make more money and doesnt mess with a good thing that has been working well. Fans see one big top tier league instead of one top league and another inferior and to them unwatchable second tier league. Broadcasters are happy because the league hits many major markets increasing visibility and encouraging their offering larger broadcast deals. Sponsors are pleased for the same reason.Winwin. No prorel scenario can offer all of that.B. A second reason your system wont work investors. You want to demote  existing MLS teams to your new MLS. Why would people that have invested tens of millions of dollars into these clubs agree to let you kill their profitailiy by sending them to a second tier where theyll draw a fraction of the viewers and a fraction of the income? If I pay  Mil for a franchise Im not going to sit idly and watch as it is forced into a realm in which it becomes vastly more difficult borderline impossible to recoup my investment. These owners did not sign up to compete on the fringes of American soccer and they wont take kindly to being made to do so. A forced move to prorel could start a war with them that would seriously threaten to kill the league.C. Your plan would wreak geographic havoc on the league and actually cost MLS sgnificant money. A big argument against prorel in north america is geography. Relegation shuffles arent a big deal in small nations like the UK or even somewhat larger ones like Germany  teams that shift up or down dont greatly impact the distances other teams will need to travel to keep competing. In North America youd have a different story given the vast distances involved. Relegate a few of the wrong sides all at once and you can make travel a nightmare for some teams.Furthermore TV rghts will suffer. Lets say ESPN is paying  million annually for MLS rights. You then tell them youre creating a second tier and moving the bottom  clubs in MLS into it. These bottom  at the time happen to include DC Toronto Miami one of the NY teams New England and Atlanta all major TV markets. Your new MLS wont hit these markets now and we all know that MLS will be about as popular as the AHL.If I am ESPN or any other major network Im offering you substantially less money come negotiation time. Your forced implementation of prorel just cost you a lot of cash.D. Prorel doesnt actually offer superior function in practice. The franchise system in American pro sports has already proven vastly more profitable than any prorel system anywhere in the world more than  of the worlds top  most valuable pro sports franchises are in US major leagues  European top tier clubs are vastly underrepresented. It has proven far more stable as well prorel leagues across the planet are known for their instability.If your hypothetical comes to pass MLS will have grown wildly successfully it will be strong enough to add  more franchises after  a fact that indicates the league will have reach excellent financial health. The singletier franchise system will have brought them there so what incentive would they have to ditch that and implement a prorel system instead? Theres no evidence that the prorel system brings any financial benefit and plenty of evidence that it brings great financial and organizational cost so why ditch a working system in favor of it?E. Where is the evidence that  teams is too many? You think MLS should make the dramatic shift to prorel because  is too big but where is the evidence that  actually is too big? Other major American sports leagues handle  teams quite capably and theres no evidence that the fandom wont support a league that size or larger. So why would MLS consider keeping the league below  teams a serious objective?,MLS,ck1jhw3,1,t5_2rbnb

1880006,0,t1_ckfoxd7,Wall of textIt just a completely different style of game.  Batting is the hard part of offense in baseball.  Everything focuses around that.  Except for a few specific cases scoring can only be done if the batter puts the ball in play.  Since batting is the major focus the importance of the stat reflect that.  Looking at it from the other side a runner cant score unless the batter puts the ball in play.  So scoring the runs has more to do with the guy batting than the guy running.  You just have to be lucky that the guys behind you can hit which isnt really saying anything about you as a baseball player. On base percentage is a much more important stat as it show how much you as a batter put yourself in position to score the run. So getting on base and getting the run home are important as an individual stat while getting to run when someone else does the hard part is not as important.,MLS,ckfqfdt,3,t5_2rbnb

1910917,0,t3_2ghy6n, Lets assume the reporting is accurate and Chivas goes in hiatus. That means Republic gets in as an expansion team only. But Sacramento really is the only sure thing re MLS expansion. Minnesota has big four major sport teams. Im unconvinced an MLS team there would be better supported than say the Crew. SA lacks deep pockets and proven large crowds. LV has stadium issues and zero proven fan support. Republic has that intangible something  ambition management city in the right place at the right time just  miles away from the unambitious Quakes that will compete with Portland for the most rabid home game atmosphere.

But the league made it clear in the press release that the franchise would not be awarded until a stadium deal was in place.Since then the stadium deal has not come to fruition so theres no franchise awarded to Miami.

2102658,0,t3_2izuzr,. Research Mourinho If I remember correctly he went to college with the same mentality.. Keep playing soccer that will keep you from asking your players to do things that you think are possible but in reality arent. . Play FIFA it sounds kind of ridicoulus that a game will pripare you for a real job. But FIFA will help you recognize different formation you will learn about different attributes players have and how to use them to your advantage and much more.. Go watch games live. A tv will just focus on whats going at the moment seeing games live will give a better perspective on the game.now all the stuff above is so you can have some knowledge of what a coach does however being that you didnt play professionally you will have to pay a lot of dues.  Try to get a job either as a coach for a youth team or try to get a job with your college soccer team as either the an assistant to the assistant or as a ball boy.

2210803,0,t3_2kfgs7,gt Fire owner Andrew Hauptman has  turned this organization into a very professionally focused one.

2211294,0,t3_2kfobf,I expected a sixth place finish until they sold Beitashour and then everything kinda went out the window. All of the aspects of the team I worried about from awful scouting to picking up waived players and selling members of the Shieldwinners for allocation money all came to fruition. Gordon going to LA with a whimper was the biggest insult besides watching every record and standard we held sacred crumble on Watsons watch mostly because the parts he was given were worse than what Yallop pieced together. That includes Stanford being a fortress vs LA. That includes unbeaten streaks. That includes Portland finally winning away at SJ. If you told me the FO was basically throwing a season to get Kinnear and wait for the stadium to be done I couldve saved myself a lot of Saturday nights.My greatest fear going into  is that the ownership will continue to peddle a smalltime underdog narrative in a metro that is full of history and championships. Hiring Kinnear back may go down as well as Zeman returning to Roma.And the worst part? Wondo is a completely wasted season closer to hanging up his boots.But you only get one local team.

2442214,0,t1_cmdc9ow,Thats a good question and it would require ambitious planning on the part of the Crew.FC Dallas has actually recruited a bunch of players from around the country to their academy.  There is a constant flow of players from El Paso including recent HG signing Alejandro Zendejas and likely future HG signing Mikey Ambrose.  Another recent HG signing Coy Craft is from Abingdon VA look that one up on a map!The way Dallas does this is by having the players move to DFW.  This requires a lot of legwork Id imagine.  You have to deal with parents school concerns relocation challenges etc.I tend to doubt that the Crew will actually harvest talent from Texas.  Most likely theyll just send  players to the Aztex and that will be that.EDIT additionally Houston and Dallas dont have homegrown rights to all players in Texas just ones in their academy.  If the Crew identified Austinarea players and moved them to the Crew academy in Ohio they could sign them.  But again Im not sure that Id rate the chances of that happening very highly.,MLS,cmdk99o,2,t5_2rbnb

He also wasnt exactly the type of keeper that could keep his composure or lead from the back and took tons of responsibility for the bad defense and made lots of mental mistakes as a result. I dont know too much about Johnson but id say his goalkeeping style coupled with the lack of defense is why he had a bad year.

With american sports its like they want to guarantee that nervewrecking with playoffs but trying to recreate it every season waters down what they seek out to do this is also why I hate the mls final because it wants to make sure it is an all out game that there is no complication on like aggregate where the team that loses the final game still ends up win the actual championship.

The USOC is a tournament featuring every team in MLS plus teams from lower leagues but a nonMLS team hasnt won this century. The Supporters Shield is the team with the best record at the end of the season.So then why do we need a second tournament after both of those are over that involves more than half the league and stretches out after a month and a half? Weve already crowned a champion of a leaguewide tournament and weve already decided the best team of the season. What is left? The playoffs are completely pointless except to sell tickets and merchandise.As long as MLS is going to follow the American model of large drawnout playoffs the regular season isnt going to matter except for seeding purposes because thats how American sports leagues view their seasons and the USOC will feel irrelevant because its redundant to the playoffs and the smallest of the three prizes.,MLS,cmpvepk,1,t5_2rbnb

UCLA on the west side USC expo Park etc. No team from outside the LA central area can capture the citys attention to the fullest potential.

As such it would make sense for them to figure out a central strategy that doesnt rely on Gilberto too much... and if he gets to stay then thats just bonus and they should be easily able to integrate him given that hes already spent a year with a lot of the other guys who form the core of the team.Then again it does feel like hes on his way out.  Would a loan be possible in some capacity so that he can rejoin the team in a years time?  Am I reaching?  I just dont want him to leave I think the stage is basically set for him to have an excellent season.  It would be a shame.  On the other hand if the reports that Perquis has joined are true then we have a pretty damn sweet squad even without Gilberto..  and I have no choice but to admit that even if there are still some holes left that need filling.,MLS,cnyzxa0,7,t5_2rbnb

2927686,0,t1_co0votm,gt While the CBA could potentially address DP arrangements its important to remember that the concept of a designated player is one related to teams managing the salary cap and defined primarily under the leagues roster rules not the CBA.That works for me but I think it is very misleading. The players are talking about going on strike and we have no idea what they will challenge in the current league structure.  I think that it is unlikely that the players do push for restrictions on DPs but if the league wants to open up another DP slot then I absolutely could see the players either blocking it or asking for concessions in order to allow it. At some point I do not think that the players will be OK with a select few players having no salary cap while the other  players have to live within the most restrictive salary cap in the world. ,MLS,co0vznr,-4,t5_2rbnb

One of the forwards stays up top to harass the opponent CBs   The wingers Play a similar role as the outside of a diamond push everything through the middle where the team has a numbers advantage  The two forwards that drop sit between the two CMs and the wingers defending the channel and forcing the opponent to work in an evenmorenarrow field.  On the attacking side the wings and outside forwards trade off working the touchline and attacking the box on a nearpost run.  Quite often the wingers dont even need to push up very far into the final third and send service diagonally towards goal curling to parallel with goal.

Petkes quote is from early  when he wanted to run a  by basically having Dax cover the defense and giving full rein to Henry Sam Cahill Espindola and Juninho to control the attack.  That lasted six weeks and failed miserably forcing him to revert to a flat  angering some of the veterans  most notably Juninho.  If you want to compare Petke and Marsch in their first month in charge ok this comparison works.

For example they are both sports with similar levels of specialized roles outside of GKs its not hyperspecialized like baseball or football where players have to be able to do a little bit of everything. You have defensefirst players who tend to be larger and taller and spend most of their time near the goal in a defensive role. CBs and basketball centers perform very similar roles their primary job is to be the final line of defense and closing down on anyone who gets near the goal  but at the other end they are often expected to be able to score from close range like CBs coming forward on corners and FKs to score headers.   Your s are like PGs  in basketball terms where the offense flows through them and they are expected to distribute the ball and setup teammates as well as be able to score.   Your wingers are like your shooting guards they are primarily speedy guys who can beat opponents in the open fieldcourt with the dribble as well as have the speed to keep up with their opposition counterparts on the defensive side.   Those target forwards who play with their back to the basket and hold the ball for the offense to move around them?  that is your Power Forward on the basketball court. They are expected to score but they also have important responsibilities in keeping pressure on defense. Both sports are based on controlling the flow of the game and managing time by controlling possession and building chances through passing and dribbling. Both sports are based on defense yes even though basketball is highscoring it is really a defensive game at its core and poor defensive teams rarely have any success. To me it is basically the same damn thing except that one is played with hands on a small surface with a tiny goal and one is played on a big surface with feet and large goal. I cant say I like one more than the other and I find them so similar its hard for me to see why people could like one but not the other. Most of the guys I grew up with who played soccer were also into basketball as well and I think being good at one helps you understand the other. ,MLS,cplh27o,3,t5_2rbnb

Most Supporters Groups around the league work independently of their clubs FO which allows them to be critical of them and create tifo and banners that may otherwise be disapproved.While being independent of the club doesnt always mean not working with them.

3524672,0,t3_30nivy,The reason for the conferences is to reduce the expense and playerwear from crosscountry travel. The US is a very big country and its even bigger when you include three Canadian MLS cities. Remember a team from Manchester or Liverpool needs nothing more than the team bus to get to any away leaguematch and a Londonbased team will play nearly threequarters of their matches in London. Chicagos closest opponent is about a sixhour drive away. New York to Seattle is almost as far as New York to Lisbon or London to the Caspian Sea.For a few years when it was still a team league MLS played a balanced schedule. But when it expanded to  teams MLS ditched the balanced schedule for a conferenceheavy but not conferenceexclusive schedule.What this means in practice is that MLS teams play inconference teams at least twice and outofconference teams once during the season. Given the current season length  league matches this will hit a balance with  teams  inconference teams home and away  matches and outofconference teams home or away  matches.Right now teams will face some inconference opponents three times in a season.,MLS,cpu1dev,3,t5_2rbnb

3682716,0,t1_cqc0yxn,I think encouraging people to tune into games on tv whether thats friends you know or in scenario youre describing is an enormous benefit for the league. Not to diminish the importance of attendance because thats necessary too and makes the tv product that much more entertaining but increases in advertising revenue via bigger audience viewership leads to greater media rights deals which leads to larger team budgets which leads to better players and so on... The Premier League went from a respectable but largely tertiary league in the greater context of the sport to the international phenom it is now in a very short period of time and almost entirely through the bigger and bigger media rights price tags Sky Sports was willing to accept because they managed to grow their audience in such significant numbers that it more than made up for the added cost.

3869464,1,t1_cqxciu6,MLS is a monopoly imo protected by USSF. Only USSF has a D sanction and no policy has been issued detailing how new entrants can enter. Its a legal discussion but MLS was challenged as a monopoly in . The jury ruled in favor of MLS and an appellate court upheld. In their decision they cite several important factors which no longer apply at all no NASL back then and MLS was not gobbling competitors. Under this new environment I think a jury would rule the opposite.  Further University of Marquette Prof M. Waxman just wrote a detailed opinion supporting an antitrust challenge of MLS on different grounds.

3955659,0,t3_35rqzl,I think the headline misleads slightly he seemed to me to be specificly accusing the New England Revolution of exploiting the system and being the ones blackmailing the Galaxy.  Given the timing and overall fuckery of the New England move  im inclined to agree. I think his more controversial remarks actually came later when asked how he would fix the flaws in the discovery list system systemWhen you get enough people that understand how to do these things in real life then eventually youll convince people Arena said. We should in my view be able to sign players that are outside the league. You discover them you sign them. It shouldnt be an issue.I think Garber will be furious with the how things work in real life quip which references the way that basically every other league on the planet does business. This one could be a big fine from the league office because its a shot at league business and an indirect reference to single entity driven policies holding back the league. Given that it was  when Bruce was critical of MLS torpedoing the Galaxy acquisition of Sascha Kljestan last year  I would guess this one is going to be double. ,MLS,cr76g4j,21,t5_2rbnb

The Chicago Blackhawks eliminating the Minnesota Wild from the third straight NHL playoffs has fueled a strong rivalry that in turn has grown both markets in my area.

4105158,0,t3_37nd8r,This election tomorrow is one of the most bizarre election scenarios Ive ever seen for a number of reasons.Its normal in this type of organization for example for representatives to support the candidate from their respective regionconfederation. After all wouldnt an AFC candidate best know and best represent the desires of the AFC?Nonetheless it appears that the AFC will overwhelmingly line up behind Blatter from a UEFA country while UEFA other than Russia is in open rebellion against Blatter and will overwhelmingly line up behind Ali from an AFC country.UEFA in fact has hinted at dire consequences if Blatter wins and at least one ExCo official has pledged to resign.Also bizarre in the event no candidate gets a  majority  votes IIRC on the first ballot there is a second ballot requiring only a simple majority.While this kind of runoff system makes sense when there are three or more candidates its really odd when there are only two.The funny thing is that this is probably good news for the good guys. Before Wednesday Blatter was predicted to win in a walkover. Since then things have changed.Although reports suggest Blatter still has overwhelming support from the CAF and AFC it now seems almost unlikely that he will win on the first ballot.If Blatter fails on the first ballot will enough representatives smell the wind changing direction?

4170289,0,t3_38jwhd,Its not often that the U.S. U and U national teams are simultaneously involved in different tournaments on separate farflung continents. So if youve been too busy following the shenanigans at FIFA to catch the games because what else would a normal person be doing at  a.m. during the week? and cant identify the top American players dont fret. Weve got you covered.With wins against Myanmar and New Zealand the Us are heading to the second round of a World Cup for the first time since . Theyll meet Ukraine in the Group A finale early Friday ET. And while the heavily shorthanded Us failed to advance at the Toulon Tournament they did manage an impressive victory over the Netherlands during their short stay in France. For both squads there were several notable individual performances. Heres the rundownUs at World CupTab Ramos team took its opener against Myanmar but wasnt particularly sharp in the  comeback victory. So Ramos made four changes to his lineup before facing the hosts  one by necessity after forward Maki Tall broke a toe ruling him out of the rest of the competition. All of the moves paid off in the  win. LA Galaxy striker Bradford Jamieson replaced Tall up front and opened the scoring for the Yanks. After coming on as a substitute and showing flashes of his vast potential against Myanmar ballyhooed Arsenal prospect Gedion Zelalem made his first U.S. start and quickly showed what all the fuss is about. Zelalem set up the Americans third goal which was scored emphatically by another lineup newcomer in Paul Arriola who has made more than  firstteam appearances for Liga MX club Tijuana. And Dutchbased Desevio Payne who appeared in two Eredivisie games for Groningen last season showed solid technical ability and tactical awareness after spelling Shaq Moore who picked up a yellow card in the first match at fullback.As well as the replacements fared in the rout Emerson Hyndman and Rubio Rubin have been the Us best players through two matches. One might have expected as much In addition to being the two most experienced players on the squad Hyndman played in nine games for Fulham in  while Rubin made  league starts for Utrecht theyre also the only ones boasting senior team caps. Hyndman was the lone American to score in both games and was generally everywhere. The clever Texans boxtobox game is similar to a young Michael Bradleys even if the diminutive Hyndman is less of a physical presence. His late runs into the box are very Bradleyesque though and his silky first touch probably makes him more naturally gifted going forward.Rubin meantime set up Hyndmans winner against Myanmar then scored himself against New Zealand. Production aside Rubin looked like a man against boys at times. Hes strong good at holding the ball up and bringing teammates into the play and an excellent passer. If theres one knock against him it might be that hes not quite selfish enough. Those arent qualities often seen in American strikers.Zelalem really does looks like the real deal so far and not because of the audacious nutmeg or Rabona kick he pulled off against the Kiwis fun to watch as those were. No the thing that stands out most about Zelalems game is his ability to relieve pressure and get his team out of trouble when necessary. Zelalem makes it look easy. His calmness on the ball in tight spaces has drawn comparisons to former American World Cup captain Claudio Reyna and it gives this U.S. team a dimension few at any level have had in the past. Zelalem can also play the killer final pass. Hes only going to get better as his comfort with his new teammates improves.Tottenham prospect Cameron CarterVickers has been the MVP of the back line. The yearold manchilds positioning has been nearly flawless through two games and hes been unbeatable in the air. He also picked up an assist on Talls tally in the opener. Matt Miazga CarterVickers partner in central defense has also been dominant. But the foot New York Red Bulls starter has occasionally allowed his emotions to get the better of him after being whistled for fouls and hes sitting on a yellow heading into the groupstage finale.Us at Toulon TournamentFor the Us senior team regulars Julian Green and Jordan Morris were the standouts on a squad that was far from full strength. Club commitments prevented coach Andi Herzog from securing the release of more than a dozen players meaning the ones he did get hadnt been playing much heading into the tournament. The rust was obvious during last weeks forgettable first half against France in which Les Bleus jumped out to an early  lead. Morris clawed one back later on but it wasnt a good showing. The Yanks rebounded well against the Netherlands but couldnt build on it rounding out their group schedule with a loss to CONCACAF rival Costa Rica and a narrow win versus Qatar.Still the Toulon tourney wasnt a worthless exercise. Morris one of just two college players on the roster continues to grow. The fast physical Stanford man was a handful for opposing defenders throughout the tournament and looked sharp and confident in every match. His consistency also has been impressive even as hes jumped back and forth between the senior team and the Us over the last three months. It was no surprise then that a day after the U.S. was eliminated Morris was added to the senior squads roster for Fridays marquee friendly against the Netherlands  p.m. ET ESPNWatchESPN. He remains very much in contention for a Gold Cup spot.Green wont join Morris in Amsterdam but Toulon was valuable for the GermanAmerican too. The yearoldwho like Morris has already scored at senior levelhasnt played one firstteam minute for club or country this calendar year. So getting four starts in France he was the only American in Herzogs XI for all four games was huge. Green struggled against France but he got better as the tournament went on scoring the winner against Qatar off a spectacular firsthalf volley. That cant hurt his confidence going into next season whatever club he ends up with following his oneseason loan to Hamburg.The team Herzog took to Toulon will likely bear little resemblance to the one that will try to qualify for the  Olympics later this year. That may have been the case anyway given the number of key players who were unavailable including World Cup veterans John Brooks and DeAndre Yedlin but its almost guaranteed now after several Yanks failed to help themselves in France. Goalkeeper Cody Cropper struggled mightily losing his place for the final two games. Shane ONeill Will Packwood and Marc Pelosi underwhelmed too although Packwood who had a shocker versus France redeemed himself somewhat with a welltaken goal against the Dutch.Two players who boosted their stock were Fatai Alashe and Jerome Kiesewetter. San Jose Earthquakes midfielder Alashe showed off his versatility by filling in on the backline while GermanAmerican Kiesewetter who made his Bundesliga debut for Stuttgart last season scored an unstoppable goal against the Netherlands.Doug McIntyre is a staff writer for ESPN The Magazine and ESPN FC.

4170494,0,t3_38j9e7,Having worked security at a major sporting venue before I can say with close to  certainty that there are more cameras in sports arenas than you even care to know about. Also I can say that pissing off any security person is a oneway ticket to ejection land. While we security folks hate to deal with the extra paperwork that is involved in an ejection wed rather do the paperwork than risk any sort of potential lawsuit for safetyrelated issues...which this was. One person can start a riot especially if theyre persistent enough. Remember when you go to a sporting event youre on private property. Every move you are making is being monitored. If you dont like the prospect of people seeing what youre doing  you probably shouldnt be doing it and  you probably shouldnt be in a stadium.While its unfortunate that they are charging that much for the course you have to think about things from a safety perspective. If  is enough of a deterrent from keeping riffraff out then the course has done its job. Dont be an asshole and you wont have to pay it.

4187164,0,t1_crwujvl,Williams has never really gotten a fair shake for the following reasons He was being using as a utility knife for Hoffenheim when JK first called him up. RB one week CB the next DM the next. Wasnt establishing consistency at the club level. Klinsmann decided to play him as a winger which has a skill set that doesnt overlap much with CB or DM. JKs reasoning was that Danny was a good defender and was pacy enough to track back. Unfortunately Williams offered almost nothing going forward and drew flak Since moving to Reading Williams has been a consistent starter in the midfield and has done very well... even taking Reading on a deep run into one of the cups.,MLS,crxjdoj,2,t5_2rbnb

But you are right to some extent that lineup did include BWP Sam Dax I believe a very similar lineup that earned a  draw vs the Revs a week before on the road.  But to expect to win a game in a tournament that has been historically put down by the redbulls whole organization treated like a joke of a tournament without seeing the big picture and then to say ok well we will field some of our regulars for this Cosmos game and to expect to win is a joke.,MLS,cs7bkt4,-2,t5_2rbnb

4382200,0,t1_csjkc2m,Real Salt Lake was more or less named after Real Madrid so named due to the patronage of the Spanish King. The most unique thing about a club is the name of the cityneighborhood theyre in so that takes a front seat. Plural Noun team naming wasnt a thing when a lot of these clubs were founded. Thats true in some american sports too the name we know a lot of our teams by are just nicknames the fans have bestowed on them that became official. The U of Alabama football team for instance is much older than Crimson Tide.A lot of European clubs do have Plural Noun names as well but they take a backseat to the name of the cityneighborhood the club is from. Manchester United are the red devils Arsenal are the Gunners etc. That came around the same way but never took a front seat.,MLS,csjlz0w,10,t5_2rbnb

4387542,0,t3_3b9dap,Ellis has some tough decisions to make.  One that should be an easy decision is that you dont start Wambach.  She has nothing left athletically and cant go  minutes.  She looked like she was running in quicksand when she had the freshest legs on the field.  At this stage Wambachs main attribute is her ability to use her size and skill on crosses and set pieces.  As such she should be always saved as a late game sub if we need a goal in the last  minutes and the opponent packs it in in that case we can use her set piece ability for some hail mary attempts.I dont now how she decides who to play in the midfield.  the LloydHolliday experiment has not worked at all even though both are great midfielders.   Brian has been solid as a holding midfielder and that allowed Lloyd to push up.  Brians has a very bright future on this team.  Also I love Rapinoe but its hard not to play Heath.  She is absurd with the ball.  Great vision and incredible ball control.  Shes like a female Pirlo hyperbole of course.The backline has been the highlight of this team this tourney.  Julie Johnson is making big play after big play and Sauerbrunn is making the player she marks invisible.  An Krieger and Klingenberg have been great out wide.,MLS,csk7nyq,4,t5_2rbnb

Even in athletics.If your supporters group believes that fans shouldnt be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation and gender identity then I believe it is not only OK to fly the rainbow flag but is a moral obligation of the SG to do so.Lets keep in mind that the rainbow flag is a representation of diversity in sexual orientation and gender identity.  So while it is designed to empower LGBT identified folks it also does represent the cis and straight among us.  It is a symbol that represents pride in oneself regardless of ones identity.  In other words for you saying you want a straight pride flag then pick up a rainbow flag because it represents you too.,MLS,cslgrw1,14,t5_2rbnb

4468526,0,t1_cstvj1f,The most valid argument is that runaway spending on big name players by a few big teams will lead to the same exact situation that killed the NASL.  The argument is that interest in smaller markets will decline because the teams cannot compete on the field or for big name foreigners.  This will put smaller market teams in a difficult financial straights ultimately in jeopardy of going under.  The lack of parity will then generally hurt interest in the league because Americans generally expect some level of parity and equality of opportunity among its sports teams.  Creating a league of haves and havenots is what killed the NASL and some fear that we are going down that road all over again.  I believe there is some validity to this argument because Toronto and NYCFC currently have payrolls that are five times larger than smaller market teams.  This is a situation that is unheard of in modern American sports.  Even the baseball payroll disparities are not so dire.,MLS,cstxlo5,2,t5_2rbnb

Its expected that the league will launch with eight teams. There will be a  domestic quota. Heres the BIG reason why the league will fail investors feel its important to launch with teams in the three biggest markets Toronto Vancouver and Montreal.

To give two extremes as an example if a player comes sprinting in  yards away and barrels into his opponent that is a careless play and a foul.  On the other hand if two plays are shoulder to shoulder  and the ball is a little bit closer to Player A. Player B jumps to win the header and Player B just stands there and undercuts Player B that is a foul on Player A.Everything in between is a judgement by the ref on who made the careless play.  You dont have a right to your space though I dont know where you are getting that from. Every goal kick and every corner would be called for fouls.  It is just not true that you have to jump vertically.,MLS,ct07gsw,2,t5_2rbnb

4582522,0,t3_3dsjix,Alright everybody now that we have a thread up its time for a little Soccer Vexillology Corner!Tonights theme is Washington DC and the DC metro area.Starting things off lets look at the three state flags that border the capital region.Lets start strong with the wonderful flag of Maryland. The Maryland flag is actually the heraldic banner of George Calvert Lord Baltimore. The flag dates back to the th century and is one of the most historically significant state flag designs. Maryland officially adopted this as their state flag on November  . It is one of only four state flags without the color blue.Before this design was officially adopted a variant was used specifically by confederate separatists known as the Crossland Banner.Moving on Virginia use a seal on blue design. Boring. Adopted in  but needs a redesign.Well jump to West Virginia who use a seal on white on blue. Still boring but Im not ranting tonight.Now well actually take a look at the flag of Washington DC. This flag is exceptional. Its based off George Washingtons personal coat of arms and is beautifully simple. DCU and the Washington Spirit have referenced this occasionally in their jerseys which is such a good thing.And now for a little bonus feature from my Flags of MLS Teams projects the flag of DC United featuring the eagle from the modern crest and the flag of FC Dallas featuring some simplified hoops in our two traditional color schemes.Thats all for tonights abbreviated edition of SVC. Keep watching match threads and Ill keep sharing flag trivia.,MLS,ct88960,16,t5_2rbnb

4588832,0,t1_ct8xoog,Good points. A couple disagreementsgt any team could beat each other checkMaybe in each game yes but statistically over time with a large enough sample size? Im sure youd see some trends consistently putting some teams over the others. This is also true in the NFL.gtAll teams have the same resources to compete.In theory yes but in reality not so much. The Union front office cant spend as big as the Sounders bc the Union owners simply dont have any money. They arent as wealthy as other ownership groups. Yes they could potentially spend big bc league rules allow it but they never will. I think this is where a lot of misunderstanding is. The league rules allow for teams to spend big but since not all clubs canare willing to then there will be differences sometimes very large. The only way to avoid this not saying we should would be for a single entity league to give all teams the exact same amount of money. gtBut with a  DP max it doesnt allow clubs such as LA to get to far ahead of the smaller market teams.Too far is the key word. They are still ahead thus not equal. You may counter with well thats still a little bit of parity. Well.. the only reason its not astronomically higher which Torontos  ratio to FC Dallas Id argue is pretty high is bc those ownership groups dont have that kind of money. If they wanted they could buy a  million dollar player. I dont think there are any rules against it.I also want to reiterate that Im not concerned about the lack of parity. Theres some very good reasons to let teams spend as much as they want due to the global competiion our league has and many other reasons. Im just trying to describe the reality of what weve got!,MLS,ct90p7a,7,t5_2rbnb

See! youre telling me there was no way CONCACAF was trying to give Mexico all the help they could after TWO shady calls to save them from elimination two games IN A ROW? Everything CONCACAF does is beyond corrupt. That Costa Rica call was the most blatant the fix is in kind of call Ive seen since . From the article Why is the Panamanian team holding up a banner that says CONCACAF THIEVES? Well maybe its because Jeffrey Webb who was the CONCACAF president until late May has been indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice for pocketing millions of dollars in a widespread corruption scheme? Webb has pleaded not guilty. Or maybe its because former CONCACAF president Jack Warner has been indicted for doing the same things? Or maybe its because former CONCACAF general secretary Chuck Blazer has already pleaded guilty to similar charges of racketeering wire fraud and corruption conspiracies?And throw on top of it The Gold Cup takes place every two years instead of every four as should be the case. Gold Cup games are often played on awful temporary grass fields that hurt the quality of the game all so more tickets can be sold in bigger stadiums. There is never a random draw to fill out the groups and brackets. Why? Well the bracket is engineeredsome would say riggedto give the best chance of producing a U.S.Mexico final which means more tickets sold and higher TV ratings. The tournament has too many venues stadiums for  teams! That helps make sure the money comes in but as a result the travel for teams is insane. The Gold Cup takes place in the U.S. every time.

And  every time he does dive on the national team my reaction is always how does a guy his size get knocked off the ball so easily?

4679332,0,t3_3f1gp8,The reason this is an issue for people is because you dont see it in the other sports. They expect MLS to be just like the NFL NBA or MLB where fans come to see their own team. You dont see a Barcelona basketball jersey at Knicks games or Moscow Hockey Medveak Zagreb jersey at a Kings game. The reason is because those leagues are the top in the world for their sport. I can guarantee you that if you went to a basketball game in Italy youd see a LeBron jersey somewhere. The United States was late to the professional soccer league due to failures and financial collapses bit this is something that will come with the territory.

4764489,0,t1_ctuwlmj,Ok let me try to answer your original question gt........ Then how does the NBA NHL and MLB do it without any issues?The answer is they dont. None of those leagues that I can find have ANY kind of preferential roster treatment. What that means is they dont count foreign players any differently than domestic players at all. So if next year Russia produced  players that were better than any player in the NHL for example there would be nothing stopping every NHL team from signing a full Russian roster and cutting every North American player.Now that doesnt happen because in the three sports you mention North America I only count Canada because of the NHL happens to be the best place in the world to develop players so there is no reason at all to protect your own player development.In MLS its much different. The USA isnt the best country in the world for developing soccer players in fact its pretty far down the list. Because of this when MLS was first created there was a very real risk of every team signing a bunch of low priced south american players going against the entire point of the creation of the league being the development of American soccer. To combat this risk a rule was put in place that ensured that most players in MLS would be American basically rosters only allowed for a certain number of foreign spots. This works and is generally a good idea.Once TFC joined the league however we found a problem. See TFC originally followed the same rules as the rest of the league except instead of Americans counting as domestic Canadians did making all American players take up a foreign roster slot. Unfortunately the state of Canadian soccer development was... shall we say... behind the Americans. TFC complained and we were given a few American roster slots to placate us. That also didnt work so now for us both American and Canadian players count as domestic so everyone is happy!Finally the states have some strange labour laws that allow them to preferentially hire Americans but NOT choose between other countries. So you could say only Americans or you can say everyone you cant say Americans and Canadians in Canada you can do exactly that. So thats why we have the wonky rules we have now and why the other leagues dont actually set any precedent unless you plan to open up ALL roster slots to ALL countries. ,MLS,ctv3wf6,1,t5_2rbnb

And if Klopas is going to deliberately omit him from the team using him only for timewasting late substitutions then they shouldnt have resigned him in the offseason.Klopas said there would be a rotation system but hes been overreliant on the upanddown Donadel and developing Mallace. Donadels suspension this week was the perfect opportunity but Klopas opted to play Alexander without any obvious reason hauling him off for NRC after  minutes and Bernier was again the most impressive CDM when he came on for Mallace  minutes later.,MLS,ctx5h0b,17,t5_2rbnb

4799707,0,t3_3glpoi,gtHis runs allowed him to see more of the ball but in deep ineffective areas as he condensed his teams vertical depth. There was no compensation by his wingers to balance his runs by occupying the space he would leave as McNamara is used to tucking inside to combine and Diskerud is a stranger to life on the wing. So as Villa was to run back into midfield to pick up the ball Diskerud and McNamara were to run up the wings to gain more vertical space.  Vertical space here is space into the opponents third correct?So if Villa runs further back into midfield to pick up the ball what is Lampard supposed to do as a number  run up and take a strikers role?  I am fuzzy on soccer tactics I am just trying to learn.Also with Jacobsen next to Pirlo is Pirlo supposed to take a more offensive role in the case that Jacobsen is supposed to be defensive and thwart a midfield attack.  Is Jacobsen taking on a more defensive role in Pirlos stead by working aside of him?,MLS,ctzjjaw,1,t5_2rbnb

4822214,0,t3_3gxir8,In case its behind a paywallChicago hates losers especially lovable hapless losers..Yet the new Cubs with all that young talent are no longer the lovable losers of Chicago. And according to Back to the Future Part II the North Siders have already won the World Series this year.The White Sox are still the White Sox playing the Cubs this weekend. The Blackhawks are Stanley Cup champions.The Bulls? A sad desperate JimmyDerrick soap opera to come. The Bears? Jay Cutler. Whatever.But theres another team out there that plays in Chicago summers losers yes but not lovable. Sports media doesnt much care but their fans care fans like me who love the club but hate to see whats happened to it.The Chicago Fire.Yeah the soccer team with the famed credo many of you have never heard Tradition Honor Passion.And now? No tradition no passion. Major League Soccer is a supremely physical league. But were forced to watch socalled stars play defense as if they were a bunch of gentle Hobbits with hairy feet.With the other teams Hawks excepted collapsing or failing the Fire had a chance to make a mark. They made their mark all right. On their shoes.Theyre in last place in the worst division in the league. And the other day they lost their only chance at a trophy by falling haplessly  to the Philadelphia Union in the U.S. Open Cup playoff.Im gutted for the club and our fans right now said head coach Frank Yallop.Gutted? Like a fish Frank you and all the rest of us.Some think the evil eye has been put on them. One fan who sits behind me at Toyota Park  Ill call him Jimmy V  wants to put charms around the field to ward off the mati or the moogli evil eye.Others of us think owner Andrew Hauptman a wealthy movie producer who lives in California is a cheapskate who either cant or wont get decent players.Fans are so angry that in Philadelphia on Wednesday they unfurled a huge banner declaring war with Hauptman. On it were these simple wordsHauptman Out.They want to embarrass the MLS into forcing a change in ownership. And it might just work.The war started two years ago when Hauptman foolishly released an open letter on the teams website signed by a hapless underling attacking fans for daring to boo Hauptman during a game.The ownerfan relationship if there ever was one died that day. Now its open war.Fire sources say the bosses are upset with the banner. But Id suggest if they dont like it then sell and let someone else run the club.One angry fan OK it was me tweeted out that the Fire had just hired a new mascot Death.This is rock bottom for the franchise said Guillermo Rivera the knowledgeable critic who writes the Chicago Fire Confidential blog carried by ChicagoNow. Im a reader.The Fire have been around since . And theyve lived up to their Tradition Honor Passion credo for years making playoffs and being respected Rivera told me over the phone Thursday.But over the past six years it has been the absolute opposite. You see the results and the way the organization has been run. Im seeing fans whove been around since the beginning fans who love the Fire now turning their backs. Theyre slipping further and further into irrelevancy.Ive met Hauptman several times. He was pleasant. I dont wish him ill. This isnt personal. But hes had his chance.All he had to do was pay for good players and leave his club alone and sit in California and make movies. But he didnt.Hes made several movies including State of Play with Russell Crowe.But Hauptman also made the  scifi film Thunderpants. The Internet Movie Database website describes it this way An yearold boys amazing ability to break wind leads him first to fame and then to death row.Thunderpants?I cant get that one out of my head. I fear it will never leave.Hauptmans problem isnt Thunderpants its that hes always on the phone meddling meddling meddling and being forced to overpay for mediocre players.Now Yallop is being made a scapegoat like the last coach Frank Klopas.But the problem isnt the coach. Its the owner. And he has to change his ways.Rocky Wirtz the best owner in town runs a decent franchise doesnt he? He hires people to run his Blackhawks and he stays out of the way and Chicago loves him.Sean Spence who writes the soccer blog Hot Time In Old Town says I compare covering the Fire to what it must have been like being a Moscow correspondent decades ago. All the suits are terrified looking over their shoulders.Evan Whitfield now a Chicago lawyer was once a tough Fire defender. Ive always thought him to be fair.Having been a player I can tell you that players are always trying Whitfield said. Its not an effort issue its a quality issue. This team is just not fun to watch.As I was finishing this the Fire released a statement by Atul Khosla the chief operating officer.We certainly understand the frustration of our fans. No one associated with the Chicago Fire Soccer Club is satisfied with this season to date. The organization however remains steadfast in its commitment to winning games and being a model franchise for business practice.Chicago Fire fans are told Tradition Honor Passion yet management speaks in the language of bureaucrats droning on about model business practice.Pathetic. Hapless. Sad.,MLS,cu2doi2,56,t5_2rbnb

You could argue the stadium and all of his other accomplishments but the only reason the team is still running is a devoted fanbase that shows up match after match all while literally being screwed by a front office that couldnt give a damn. How many awful mistakes can a person make before they are let go? Even with the argument that its the coaches not him or the players not him how many coaches and players can he hire and then fire before it all falls on him? His lack of knowledge of the game and commitment to bettering the team is beyond astounding and I hope he is released from his role every time I open the twitter app or come on these forums.On Sugarman how long can MLS let people who are barely capable of paying the bills without sucking the life out of fans own a team? Theres a reason people with a billion dollars own clubs its about being able to fund the venture not just use it as a cash cow. Why cant he find more investors? The whole thing is just an awful blemish on MLS in general but no one takes notice. If it wasnt for the fans still here we would have been Chivas before Chivas was Chivas and we are not even competing against someone locally. Its extremely frustrating that nothing is being done and the worst part is the fans wont leave because we are used to it by now. How long have Eagles fans been saying we will get them next season? How long has it been since the Eagles won a Superbowl?

The English Championship is a crapshoot. Obviously the promotion battle is tense and dramatic but no one has a clue right now as to the favorites.

ONeill is a good player even if his career has been thrown off track by the dreaded Mastroeni Era of the Rapids.  Packwood doesnt belong Tim Parker or Walker Zimmerman would have been better choices.FBs  SOS!  The only player who actually gets playing time at LB in MLS Amadou Dia still hasnt been called into a camp.  Okwuonu Sorto and Miller are all mediocrities or worse and Serna isnt really a LB.  We desperately need Desevio Payne to get healthy and be released for qualifying.CM  lots of depth here.  Trapp  Polster are good DMs and solid players like Alashe Acosta Stanko Canouse have been left out.  Hyndman Zelalem Gil  a lot of talent there even if Gil is stagnatingregressing for his club.  On the down side Joya is one of those annoying inertia call ups who wont go away even though hes been lapped by a ton of players and no longer belongs in the mix.Wingers  Ariyibi was given a look and quickly dropped for the Us so Im surprised to see him here.  Arriola would easily be a better choice.  Im not really sure what Pelosi brings to the table either or what his position is really.Forwards  Glad to see Rubin maybe that means theres a chance hell be released for qualifying.  The rest...meh.  But take Rubin add a healthy Jordan Morris and a healthy Jose Villarreal and Ill be happy with that for qualifiers.,MLS,cuj19dh,1,t5_2rbnb

There is simply no comparing NASL to MLS or USL to NASL mind you in terms of the quality of the operations of the team and the league. No rational observer would find NASL to be at the same division as MLS.Instead of wasting so much time on this antagonistic and fruitless errand NASL should continue to develop high quality expansion clubs like Jacksonville Indy Ottawa New York and San Antonio. It should continue to work to stabilize and secure the futures of clubs like Carolina Fort Lauderdale San Antonio and now potentially Tampa Bay. It should give a good send off to Minnesota and work on a way to allow Edmonton and Ottawa to succeed by leading a robust Canadian league that could have some affiliation or tie in to the NASL. And it should continue to support teams like Indy and New York in building ambitious soccer specific stadiums that would cement the status of their teams.When Bill Peterson goes and runs his mouth about ProRel he comes off as demanding something that the league hasnt earned. He isnt telling the story of Jacksonville of Indy of Miguel Ibarra of Christian Ramirez of Lance Laing of Billy Forbes.

I certainly dont see anything implying that FIFA ever sanctioned indoor football that wasnt properly called Futsal  yet a different standard. Heres the relevant quotes for yougt FIFA the international body that oversees international association football competitions does not sanction the synthetic turf version of indoor soccer having developed its own code of indoor football which they refer to as futsal.gt  The World Minifootball Federation WMF is the governing body of indoor soccer at the international level having replaced the International Fast Football Federation FIFRA.Perhaps you should read over the remainder of that wiki article as well where it clearly lays out that indoor football is a different regulated body and ruleset from traditional association football  insomuch as scoring can often be different depending on league implementation.Further I can find absolutely zero evidence that any indoor soccer is sanctioned by FIFA outside of Futsal  which NPSL was not.Care to I dunno maybe back up your claims instead of ranting at someone over hyperbolic statements like what is and isnt soccer?,MLS,cun4ntr,1,t5_2rbnb
4987598,0,t1_cun4ibj,I watch them play pretty regularly at right back Jones is the number one Matthews the number two is currently injured Yedlin will be third in the depth chart there once Matthews is healthy but maybe he can make some good sub appearances while Matthews is out who knows. Jones is pretty shit as far as PL standards go but Yedlin hasnt looked better recently Matthews is alright I think he was pretty good with Celtic though nothing special but Im confident hell Matthews be the number one once healthy. Van Aanholt on the left is dogshit so maybe Jones will get shifted out there freeing up the right back spot while Matthews is out for Yedlin to get some game time right away.On the wing Yedlin will be behind Lens whos fucking good Borini pretty average PL player but did well last time on loan at Sunderland Larsson has been mostly played centrally but has experience on the wing Gomez and Buckley are pretty shit tbh so maybe Yedlin can boost some minutes off them with his speed off the bench but idk. Also Adam Johnsons currently injured but hes miles ahead of Yedlin. Whenif everyones healthy optimistically hell be number four on the depth chart at right wing depending on him overtaking Gomez and Buckley.Its a better situation than at Tottenham but I definitely wouldnt call it a good one actually a pretty bad one tbh. Sunderlands going to be fighting off relegation and have depthexperience at Yedlins positions and as everyone knows experienceknown quantities are what gets game time during relegation battles and young loanees are definitely not going to be the guys managers look to in those situations. Yedlin will get more minutes than at Tottenham but I think expecting more than  starts or  appearances in total would be very optimistic.,MLS,cun6v2t,3,t5_2rbnb

4988760,0,t1_cuna3l1,Were rivals and play in the same city what else did you expect? And especially looking at the history of professional soccer here the rivalry is pretty much guaranteed to be filled with hatred. A lot of Cosmos fans now are fans who were previously a part of the NY movement a movement entirely run by the Borough Boys before and were greeted with a slap in the face when that NY team turned out to be what it was. Keep in mind some of these NYCosmos fans myself included go as far back as the Metro days and were originally turned off to American soccer entirely by Red Bulls ownership and saw NY as an opportunity to get back into it again nearly  years later. Then NYCFC happened and instead of being taken for a ride a second time the Borough Boys pulled their support and switched to the Cosmos despite Mark Abbott calling them and practically begging on the phone for them to come back like a person whose just been caught cheating on their partner.To me and other Cosmos fans especially those from the Metro days NYCFC and Red Bull stands for pretty much everything I am against. A club should put its city and its fans first NYCFC puts Manchester City and its academy first. I think thats an embarrassment to American soccer that we allow clubs who care more about the brand extension of some other entity than their own fans and their own community. I thought the same way about Chivas and I think the same way about this new Rayo OKC thing. The way CFG does things because of their particular set of motives and the way NYCFC fans have gone about doing things because of their lack of experience and independence are the root source of several embarrassments of the team. To me things like the Lampard situation the jersey being a copypaste job and the things I mentioned in the second paragraph about the fanbase are all pretty much exactly what I would expect from such an operation based on other ones like it in the world. So posting about this stuff is really just me saying see this is what happens when you club is run like a brand extensionacademy dumping ground.You can disagree with me on this but that is my view of things and it simply isnt going to change.So TLDR I care because your team is in part the result of my teams fans putting in all the effort on the ground talking to politicians and investors and building a movement over  years only to be slapped in the face with the ChivasRed Bulllike abomination that is NYCFC.,MLS,cunbwx2,4,t5_2rbnb

4994737,0,t3_3j9hod,Older player who went through a European season the World Cup another European season with Champions League and virtually no rest...  The man has been playing soccer for over  years straight with little to no rest.Then joins an expansion team in the middle of the season.  A team that had a lot of needs none of which he himself fills.  None of the actual needs were addressed so those faults are still there and he has not had time to build chemistry and learn about his team mates.And a player of his caliber is going to struggle when surrounded by lower qualityexperienced team mates.  I see this all the time with Kaka he is expecting certain runs and openings that never happen because the talent around him is no where need his level.  Players like Kaka and Pirlo almost have to play down to their team mates a little and have more patience when things do not work out.To see the flip side of this just look at Gerrard at LA.  With Keene and the rest of the quality out there Gerrard has been able to quickly adapt and contribute.  The overall quality of players for LA is higher than NYCFC and OCSC so their quality DPs have an easier time adjusting and gelling.I think Pirlo and Kaka will have better seasons next year as long as some roster changes are made and they are given the time necessary to adjust their game to their team mates. ,MLS,cuo1vlj,2,t5_2rbnb

5133505,0,t1_cv4pd71, Like I said fair enough.  Right now thats true. My problem is that none of the current players whether they be Beckermans or Bradleys are good enough to take the USMNT where I think we all want them to be. Even if all of our best players were playing in Europe now they still wouldnt be good enough to compete with the likes of Germany France Italy Brazil or The Netherlands. The talent just isnt there. Short term there is no solution to this problem. Sure we can keep our best players in Europe and sure while there theyll compete at a higher level but thats not going to win us a World Cup which I think we all agree is the ultimate goal. Its not like were sitting on the cusp of the top tier teams and would break into them if our players were a little better. The talent just isnt there and its going to be a while before it is. Since there isnt a short term solution then lets look long term. We need to have a better youth development system in our country so that kids can learn game the right way at a younger age. This will produce a more talented player pool and will hopefully give us players that can compete at the highest international level eventually. The best way to accomplish that? Have a popular highly competitive domestic league that can invest money in proper youth development.  Yes baby steps. I agree. Right now the domestic league isnt good enough to develop our talent the way that is necessary to compete at the highest levels. But... were years and years away from that being the case anyway. The MLS is growing and fast. Its becoming more competitive every year. The best way to continue its growth and continue raising the level of competition is to continue to bring player talent to the league. Bedoya is a talented player and a name from the USMNT that is easy to market. This could attract casual US soccer fans to follow the league more closely thus growing the league. Shit Ill even concede that Bedoya playing for the Union is probably not good for his international career or the USMNT as a whole but honestly? I dont care. Even if Bedoya never plays another game for the USMNT I dont think he was ever gonna be the difference maker that pushes us to the upper echelon of international soccer. Id rather the MLS make money off of his talents at home than send more money to France to watch him play over there. Ligue  popularity doesnt help the U.S. make money domestically to invest in youth development and therefore doesnt help the USMNTs future.  I agree. This is a good thing and I think we should continue to do whatever we can to encourage its growth. Like bring more talented players to the MLS so that fans get excited about watching a higher level of soccer played domestically.  I disagree. People watching the EPL and the Budesliga doesnt help the USMNT even if they are watching USMNT players. Fox and NBC pay those leagues for the right to air the games. The money made goes to the other leagues which will invest in youth development in their own countries instead of the U.S. In the sense that it gets people more excited about the sport? Yeah its good but what we need is for people to be interested in domestic soccer if we want investment in domestic youth development. Moreover the locality is a HUGE thing that we can tap into. Maybe because Im from Philly Im biased but I know that everyone around here has an enormous sense of pride when rooting for their home team in any sport. I absolutely loathe baseball but you better believe I was marching down Broad St. when the Phillies won the World Series. Sports is huge part of American culture already and if the MLS can tap into that culture there is a lot of opportunity to make money similar to how the other major sports do.  I guess? I know next to nothing about the Asian leagues so I cant really argue with you but I would venture a guess that the MLS is bigger than those leagues. Moreover I would guess that sports culture in general is a bigger deal in the U.S. than in Japan and Korea. I think the U.S. has a unique opportunity to host a world class Soccer league because we have the economy for it a preexisting sports culture and half the population of all of Europe to draw on.   Again I disagree. I dont think their international careers have been devastated or anything but even if they were hurt I dont really care. We saw the best the USMNT had to offer in the last World Cup and while the campaign was admirable it was clear to me that there is a long way to go before we can even dream of lifting a trophy at the end of that tournament. Kaka and Villa did help the league. Im not saying we just bring in USMNT players but I think that names that casual USMNT fans are familiar with are good targets. ,MLS,cv4s1qg,1,t5_2rbnb

In terms of league building legacy and career contribution to their clubs guys like Feilhaber and other American MLS journeymen are going to be the core of the league. But we must keep it in context. I said elsewhere in this thread that Cobi Jones is the kind of guy thats left a legacy on this league. Hes a legend. And a straight up cool guy who you can actually run into and talk to at Galaxy games. He deserves recognition for consistent excellence over the course of a decade. But hes also not better than Thierry Henry. Hes won the World Cup the Club Treble and was PFA Player of the Year twice.

They need a footballing brain who knows the league inside and out. Im positive Nelson Rodriguez knows this.

5351102,0,t1_cvvl3qi,I agree with your points but to play devils advocate...Does he get any credit for significant results against Mexico in Mexico in Italy against Germany in Germany in the Netherlands etc? What about winning the last gold cup winning WC qualifying groups while Mexico floundered? Does he get credit for finding and attracting dual nationals? Being bold by expanding the player pool not being afraid to play a college player and a NASL player etc? Does he get credit for campaigning for guys to get into good situations in Europe so they are getting playing time? Im not sure about the answers to these questions. He has had some significant successes that no other US manager has achieved but I still have my concerns in addition to the ones you listed. Does he overtrain his players? Would Jozy have been injured in the last World Cup if he didnt go so hard on them before the tournament? Is it a coincidence that almost all the GermanAmericans are suffering through an injury right now as they are starting their league seasons? Why does he still insist on playing players out of position? Yes Bradley can be one of our most dynamic players going forward but to be his best he needs to have the space to do so from the deep lying d mid position. Does he deserve criticism for not being s stronger  supporter of players staying in MLS where theyll get more playing time and be more counted on as team leaders?

We havent been developing high enough level talent in the past.  Arena for whatever reason obviously had a much more talented roster than what we have today.  I dont think thats even somewhat questionable so its hard to say every aspect of American soccer is better.Ive said this  times now but youth team results are not a reflection of a successful developmental system.  They mean nothing.  The goal of a youth team coach is to produce talent that fit into the USMNT system and style.  This would be the Yedlins Woods and Morrises.  You keep producing them at a high enough level and it doesnt matter if you lose every single youth game forever.gtHow are the soccer player development roots in Panama a relatively poor country of . million people comparable to the Cleveland metropolitan area?They are actually generally better for a few reasons.  Most of those good players come up through a system that has a different team for every single age and go through a different coach at every stage to learn how to fit into a specific single style of play.  The US did not have a system like this before Klinsmann came in.

Jurgens counterpart Joachim Low didnt when the Euro during there last go around and while he faced criticism from the German press no rationally thought he should be fired. The difference from the German media to the US is that both criticize the coach but the Germans follow my logic and criticize the players heavily. Their mentality is that while tactics can be wrong and lead to loses players playing to their full potential should at least be able to keep the game competitive. If a professional player is making terrible passes and turning over the ball like an amateur then the player needs to be held accountable.

If they are accepted for Division  status it will be entirely due to conflicts of interest and will just add a huge amount of fuel to NASLs antitrust lawsuit the merits of which I will not comment on. Before anyone makes a comparison to NASL not having a West Coast team these are not even close to being comparable shortcomings. One involves starting one new team the other involves eight separate ownership groups investing many millions of dollars into their team some of which dont have that kind of money to begin with and each going through all the bureaucratic red tape process in their respective cities.The only way USL meets the requirements is if it kicks a huge chunk of the league out including some MLS reserve teams.,MLS,cw15yeo,37,t5_2rbnb

Thats why he set up this youth network because he knows the USA game of soccer VERY well with have two sons growing up playing at the highest level.  This is why Atlanta United already have a deal with Concorde and georgia United because blank already knew these people and knows that georgia has the best with florida Texas California youth development in the country.  Georgia United and Concorde are the two best da academies that are not mls da academys.  With the Atlanta da academy starting up they will take the best players from those academys and will be scary good.  As cliche as this sounds he really is not in this all for the money.  He genuinely is a HUGE soccer fan and knows ALOT about how the game works in the USA. After all he disguised making a brand new stadium in the form of making an excuse the Falcons needed a new stadium.  When actually he just used that as an excuse to try and get them to build one to be mls eligible.  Whew... Excuse my grammar ,MLS,cw1i39g,2,t5_2rbnb

5442136,0,t3_3pkvx6,If they would stop getting injured andor suspended I would like them.Joking aside Oba is still Oba. Once in a while he gets frustrated and fades into the background but when hes on hes on. If he hadnt spent two months on a stretcher I think he would again be in the discussion for MVP even if it still rightfully belongs to Giovinco.Dempsey started off great goal or assist in the first dozen matches or something like that but ever since his suspension in June and the Gold Cup hes clearly lost a step. I hope it isnt the realities of age and injury finally catching up with him but Im really starting to think that next year might be it for Deuce.Ozzie is still the most important member of our squad. Its amazing just how much better we are both defensively and offensively when he is on the field. While he isnt covering as much ground as he used to gets forward a lot less now his workrate is still great and his distribution abilities are insane. So far I love Valdez. Hes a goddamn warrior and takes a beating every time he steps on the field and still finds time to make some great plays. He always pressures defensively and provides a great third attacking player coming out of midfield behind Deuce and Oba. Hes basically an upgraded Neagle.Torres was tall. I like the idea of partnering the best CB in CONCACAF with one of the best CBs in MLS but I do worry that were making our back line a bit vulnerable to speed. Particularly with the way Dallas and Vancouver are developing their squads having the two giants in the CB position might be worse than having one paired with a more athletic player like Evans.

5487640,1,t3_3q7xe0,Let me be Debbie Downer for a minute and I doublepreapologize because Im copypasting from my previous comment in rsoundersgtI apologize for the rant thats about to come but.... This decision day thing only sounds like a great idea until you think about how it actually plays out. The way it actually plays out is that while all k people at the stadium tonight were able to see the updated scores of other games throughout the match none of them were able to contribute to viewership numbers for any other match. So from a ratingsviewership standpoint its a loss. If LA SJ and POR games had been on TV at other dates or times I probably would have watched them all because I cared about those results. I might have even watched an eastern conference game or two had they not been on at the exact time I needed to get to the game I attended. And the same thing holds true for every fan that attended any game today  they were pretty much precluded from viewing the broadcast of ALL games as a result.Now maybe theres a huge viewership that doesnt attend games maybe theres more to be had in replay revenues AFAIK I cant pay anyone more to watch a game thats blacked out on MLSLIVE at any point in the next  days and I cant even pay MLSLIVE more to let me see them but Ill watch the condensed versions and be satiated all at a cost I sunk half a year ago or more maybe way more people paid to stream games on their phones while they were at a match than I could ever dream of maybe theres some other source of the broadcastlive coverage revenue conversion that Im just missing. But it seems to me that this scheduling option intentionally removes viewership of these games that would typically be among the highestviewed.Not to mention that there were so many ways the western conference results could play out that having a list of match scores didnt really help me understand what the results actually meant. I knew going in that win  in but that depending on other results win could also mean anything from a bye to an away game and I wasnt really any more clear on how that all played out until after I got home after the match.I did see a graphic on the sideoffield displays that said CLINCHED before i left the stadium but I pretty much knew that after the th minute.

5514650,0,t1_cwg4x54,gtFirst off pittsburgh is shit sports town we only support winners. I begrudgingly lived in Pittsburgh from  and I absolutely back this statement. During my time there no one went to Pirates games to Penguins games to Pitt football or basketball games or to anything that could possibly be construed as minor league. The only exception to this rule is the Steelers  the four championships in the s bought the town forever. When the Pens were at the bottom of the league Mario Lemieux had to drag his ass outta retirement to boost attendance and it was shit postlockout until they started winning after getting Crosby. The Pens really would have probably moved if the Consol Center wasnt built  I do not doubt Mario wanted to keep the team there but the igloo was falling apart and he couldnt personally finance the team past a certain point. Pitt football was so down that the University made the decision to tear down their oncampus stadium.  Can you imagine a Power Five conference team doing something like that now?  Pitt basketball which no one ever really cared about at all had a sudden resurgence under Ben Howland that coincided with the opening of the Petersen Center.  In all seriousness  if Pittsburgh were to get an MLS team they would have to win immediately and frequently to draw. And then the bandwagon Pittsburgh fans would be insufferable. ,MLS,cwgjpa9,5,t5_2rbnb

5558331,0,t1_cwlx6xq,Thats all fine and good but intentional and unnatural are subjective calls. If this had happened the other way around I guarantee Seattle fans would be saying it shouldve been a PK.  Consider this You are on offense and I am on defense. We are running side by side in the box and you are trying to get a cross away. My arm is in a natural running stance meaning my elbow is bent  degrees and my forearm is perpendicular to my body Most would agree that people dont run with both arms down at their sides that would be unnatural. Your cross hits my forearm effectively blocking the cross.  you and your team are going to say it should be a PK even though you cant prove that I intended to handle it or not I would not have time to react and my arm is in a natural position for what my body is doing running.This scenario happens all the time and sometimes its a PK and sometimes it isnt.  I appreciate that you are directly siting the rules but there is still a great deal of inherent subjectivity involved when judging intent. What is NOT subjective at all is that the ball hit his arm in the box and affected the shotcrosswhatever. Its just silly when we get into he didnt mean to like you can see into his head. Ill say it again if this was a Dallas players forearm in the Dallas penalty area you probably wouldnt see it the same way.  ,MLS,cwm28nj,2,t5_2rbnb

5647335,0,t1_cwwt4t0,Yes he cited city limit population statistics but his argument concerns regional populations. By that same logic it would be argued that having a team based in Carson CA is obviously just batshit insane because Carson has a population total of  people which might be able to just barely crack the top  most populated cities in the US. Thus the Galaxy dont even have a chance to attract enough people to support a th tier soccer team. No one really gives a damn about city limit population statistics because they are just utterly meaningless in most cases. Metro area and Core region statistics are really what matter. ,MLS,cwx3up2,1,t5_2rbnb

I love love love watching Lloyd Sam and Dax McCarty for  each weekend less really with a season ticket and feeling like a part of the team community. I wouldnt trade it for paying  to watch Messi or Ronaldo come stomp my team once every year en route to one of their teams winning the title by a ton. It seemed like some other people agreed.So I think when it comes to this subject people sometimes have different priorities or goals in mind but we dont always clarify that.

There is zero knowledge of how much influence Phil Rawlins or Flavio had on this move. You know why? Because its not official! Who from Orlando City began the relationship between OCSC and Benfica?When Carneiro was hired it was seen as a huge move for the front office. Well... is he a hood ornament? Or are you going to let the guy do his job? He releases a goalkeeper who was letting in . goals per game and played less than  games for the nd year in a row. I love Tally Hall and was just as shocked as everyone else when he was released... but the move isnt without logic.Ill also add that there is zero indication as to what role Graca is going to play for Orlando if he does actually sign. Will he be the starter? Will he backup Earl Edwards? Will we sign another more experienced keeper?The playoffs arent even over and I see a surprising number of OCSC fans freaking out not saying you were...  Just give this process some time! I doubt Carneiro would come into this situation and make unilateral decisions without any input from the rest of the front office which has plenty of MLS experience. Our front office has been just about nothing but slam dunks since coming to Orlando. Let them work. In January when were about to start preseason well have a clearer picture of where were going. Well have tons to discuss by then.,MLS,cxgjok6,5,t5_2rbnb

They put their stadium about  minutes north of Dallas and like over an hour from Fort Worth which is only accessible by toll road dont have anyone directing traffic before or after the game. They put their games on a network which is only on one cable provider down here so if you dont have them you are fucked. They care about the bottom line and thats it dont care about growing the team or the fan base. I fully expect them to sell Castillo Diaz and Perez in the break. On top of all that their Twitter taunted a fan saying something along the lines of Twitter runs security right?.

The metal detectors were just really poorly planned in my opinion.  metal detectors at each gate one gate had  I heard just is not enough to get K fans into the stadium in my opinion. Really frustrating for one of the biggest games in FCD history. Although the second half was one of the most entertaining halves of soccer Ive seen. The team did everything they could to cover the aggregate score deficit. Great heart from the team. The front office though is really frustrating.,MLS,cxhygf1,1,t5_2rbnb

MLS Cup is about getting hot at the right time which the Timbers obviously did or the Galaxy seemingly every year before. I wish SS were the one recognized as league champion but American sports will always be about the team that wins the last game.

5826952,0,t1_cxje1ci,Could certainly turn out that way.But DC fans seem to think hes started playing much better again recently. And this is an option year on Pontius contract. It would make sense the Union traded for his rights to be the first team to be able to renegotiate his contract to something more reasonable. And if he doesnt want to renegotiate he can test his luck in the waiverreentry drafts and the Union are out a little bit of allocation money.But thats assuming that MLS still works that way so who knows haha.Edit Apparently according to Goff the Union tried to renegotiate but Colorado was also in on him so opted to exercise the full option to make sure they got him.

You need someone with a Cam Newton or Odell Beckham Jr. personality type in order to captivate the nonfan.

5850502,0,t1_cxlxs91,Garber isnt being smart about this or for some reason simply hasnt done his homework in terms of demographics.  My guess is that he imagines that since the Quakes have never been especially successful in capturing the very large Northern Californian audience it doesnt make much sense to double down on an even smaller city that as far as he can tell isnt even really part of the Bay Area what he sees as the ultimate prize here at all.  What Garber isnt getting is that San Jose has never really been a good centrally located city for most Northern Californians in the first place give us Oakland or SF and wed be all over it that its always been misbranded by Northern Californian standards when we think of earthquakes we think of The City obviously not SJ that Republic FC is fucking brilliant branding thats spot on target I am a graduate of Sonoma Valley High so maybe Im biased and most of Northern Californian culture bears much more in common with Cascadia than it does with Southern California or even Silicon Valley.    ,MLS,cxmj28f,3,t5_2rbnb

5988571,0,t3_3xh9gr,You guys literally have no chill. Many people dont know this but Bendik is honestly a bloody amazing keeper most of the time. When he took Stefan Freis spot there was a reason behind it He was extremely solid for his age and experience. Move on to  Cesar comes along so Bendik was benched for the first few games. But when the World Cup came did Bendik step up or what. Even though Cesar played very few games to judge him I would argue that Bendik had more of an influence that season. He saved us so many times that I couldnt even keep count to a certain point. He stepped up when we needed him he stepped up when our CB pairing was just a pair of  year olds around there. Honestly he was really good. There was a reason that in the beginning of the next season Vanney was sort of disappointing that Bendik wasnt getting looked at as an option for the US camp. Insert  Bendik had a rough start and got injured. Konopka came and did decent but honestly very rough TBH had a lot of small mistakes. Bendik came back and took his spot but couldnt regain his form and Konopka took it from there again and overall we just didnt have a true solid keeper to rely on. Truth be told Bendik was still pretty decent after his return from injury but not near the year before. Anyways what happened is that millions obviously exaggerated of Bandwagon fans who just came this year because of Seba and didnt really see Bendik before this season not a bad thing at all really but... all just started complaining and saying a whole bunch of negative things about Bendik and honestly he might have let this get to his head. My point is that give him a chance to prove himself. He is young and has the potential to be a really good keeper. In my honest opinion a change of team might just be what he needs to get going. Trust me you will like him.Give Bendik A Chance,MLS,cy4msmi,36,t5_2rbnb

When people can get out of work and quickly grab the expo line to make it in time for kickoff vs driving to Carson and missing an entire half LAG can bring Messi and fans still wouldnt be able to make it to most matches despite their desire to do so.

The club dumped him on a team but they sent him back after half a season because he was completely unimpressive. Then he constantly went to random teams to train but they would always send him back. They really had a hard time finding teams who would take him on loan. I remember a second division team in Switzerland sending him away as well as an Italian team.

6631792,0,t1_d03e6jm,Vnecks are far superior and I dont understand why they arent just standard practice. Manufacturers always go backandforth between crew and v every few years and I simply dont get it it is always the first thing i look at when they release a new kit.  The worst were the shirts from the first couple seasons in MLS. They were more like mock turtlenecks than crew necks. I ended up with a shirt that was a size too big and baggy throughout the body otherwise it would have strangled me. I hated the bra straps but at least they fixed the neck hole with the next generation. And it gets ten times worse if you actually play in them. Vnecks seem to help you keep a lot cooler it feels like you radiate a lot more heat from you neckupper chest area with those extra couple sq. inches of exposed skin.   Plus no matter type of advances moisturewicking fabric you use that part of the shirt always gets saturated with sweat so as soon as you stop running it feels gross as hell to have the sensation of a cold and wet dishcloth hanging from your adams apple.  And besides the functional aspects of it all they simple look better on virtually anyone. The Vneck is just more flattering to just about any body type or shape of face unless maybe if you are anorexic skinny or orca fact. ,MLS,d05a96w,2,t5_2rbnb

A lot of the other top leagues in Europe do that for their clubs playing in international competition. Both fans and managers have said that the Premier League is putting their own clubs at a disadvantage in Europe in order to keep their league games at a time when most people can view them.

I never said Clint Dempsey wasnt athletic obviously hes a great athlete just that compared to other top guys in American sports hes well behind athletically.

Hes lost a step over the last year and a half I dont think any RSL fan would legitimately argue that point.  But as even stated in article.. Beckerman brings some balance to the midfield. Hes an incredible leader and I think that counts for something. Kyle might not have all the physical tools remaining to play the position at this level particularly leading up to a World Cup bid but he shows what Klinsmann wants and expects out of the position and I think thats important for the young up and comers at that position. I wouldnt be surprised if Klinsmann continues to call Kyle up for the next couple of months while he attempts to integrate somebody like Trapp Kitchen etc into that position in a more permanent role.  ,MLS,d1b3d51,5,t5_2rbnb

Garber understands all of that and has instituted massive policy changes to swing things that way.

As for Central American players the second best league in Concacaf is MLS following liga MX but the draw to live in the United States and Canada of all places possible seems to me like it would be a massive draw.

Our native prepared food are usually higher in fat content and also salt. Beef while not a premium item in Honduras is priced higher than it is here in the US. Leaner meat pork chicken and fish are far more common. If a Honduran player succumbs to fast food dining experience he will most likely gain weight. Many young foreign players come here to the US with no or little family and most likely no one to cook proper meals if they cannot do it themselves.

7323674,0,t1_d2ajrqt,Which is why its a problem on the USSFFIFA level. They are the ones responsible for dictating how the sport is organized. Of course nobody who bought into MLS for  million or any amount would want to get relegated. But they never should have had to pay that in the first place. That money could have been much better spent on players staffing academies facilities etc. etc. etc. to make their clubs and the sport better. Instead of bettering the game MLS profits off new owners joining their private club and create a bidding war and manufactured limited supply to drive up the price of getting in.    Yes the TV networks love the big markets and wouldnt want them to fall off. But in a prorel system there would surely be at least  or  teams in every big market its unlikely that there would be no NYLAChicago and so on at the top level. And the minnow clubs would create the underdogcinderella story that American sports fans and media love. How many live Leicester City matches has NBC Sports shown this year on TV? Have they not hyped the crap out of that and are people not loving it? Ratings certainly dont go down for March Madness when a team like Florida Gulf Coast makes a run. Its the owners of MLS wanting to protect their interests and make profits that is going to stop prorel from ever happeningat least involving MLS. Quite frankly I find it puzzling that places like Sacramento Cincinnati and Orlando and Montreal and Portland in the past who are drawing bigger crowds than many MLS teams and winning trophies and probably making money line up to drop millions of dollars to get in to MLS up their expenses and probably lose money for years to come.,MLS,d2angnc,4,t5_2rbnb

Still though did MLS have to put a new franchise in Atlanta no. they could have easily bought the team or found people who would buy the team.

7482843,0,t1_d2sex0f,Well under the current system theres no guarantees either. The current system closes the top division off from many many clubs and cities which is unfortunate for them. The notion of stability is important and Im not saying clubs shouldnt have reasonable financial fair play rules. The overspending within the UK is not to be admired. Theres many other countries to try to emulate. Germany limits clubs from overspending for example. Many minor league teams have folded in the past decade and luckily the corner has turned a little. My concern is that the best examples of success are clubs trying to bid for MLS and what happens when that stops? Where is the upside for clubs that are not ReadyMLS? I cant get excited by the possibility that MLS will remain closed off and develop their own minor leagues like the MLB.

7703034,0,t1_d3gpqo2,Im a Villa fan. Youre thinking of the Guzan from part of . Guzan went from mediocre to poor in the  season. It seemed once Sherwood took over Guzans form went out the door and stayed out. He was benched for Given and Steer as well. Guzan regained the starting spot in offseason but then this past season was Guzans worst season as a pro yet. So many soft goals let in tons of errors multiple which led to goals and he even had the fans turn on when he told some fans to fuck off. I think this Copa will make or break Guzans career.

7742501,0,t1_d3m8eoq,gt So the accusation came  year after the alleged incident and was reported on facebook. When the facts start coming in Im going to do my best to look at this one without bias but were off to a pretty bad start.I have a pretty strong antifeminist streak in me because of all the bullcrap that comes with it nowadays and want to be in your camp on this but after thinking about it for a second I gotta plain disagree with you.  Heres why It takes a while for any sufferer of abuse to gather up the courage to come forward.  Whether its domestic or sexual or both.  Whether the alleged victim is male or female.  Its not unusual for it to take some time for a person who feels victimized to confront their alleged assailant. Because its Facebook is why Im willing to lend the accuser some credibility.  Because her name is on the unaltered post.  An accuser usually gets anonymity when they seek out the police to file their grievance.  There is very little for this woman to gain by coming out publicly right off the bat.If this woman wanted money or retribution without the fear of being shamed or harassed she could have accomplished both behind closed doors.Instead she exposed herself put herself out there with no guarantee of reward or immunity from public hatred... from people like you who question her integrity and motivations from the getgo.She didnt have to do that at all.So whether anything becomes of these allegations or not  its gonna be hard to get people to act on an attempted rapeassault accusation from a year ago with no physical evidence to back it up then or now  I disagree with you that the nature of their coming to light indicates a pretty bad start as if the womans integrity is immediately suspect as a result of her internal reconciliation process.EDIT Expounding,MLS,d3m9lc2,12,t5_2rbnb

Its the most popular most visible and most covered sport in America. In reality the contracts are REALLY favored towards the teams and most of the guys there are not educated enough in finances to  hire a good financial advisor and  hire a really good agent. The risk of injury is so high that teams put injury clauses in some players contracts so that if they get hurt they can be cut without owing any money.

This meant NZ had something to prove this year. NZs win this year makes them the th team to qualify for the tournament Russia Germany Australia Chile Mexico qualified previously with only the UEFA and CAF waiting to decide their entrants.The coach of NZ talked about how he wanted to bring in some youth for the tourney and that was part of the reason Kip Colvey gained a call up. He was previously under the radar but thanks to getting drafted by the Quakes and then surprisingly getting some starts he caught the attention of NZ. He was a dual citizen NZAmerican but he is now cap tied to NZ for good. Colvey started in  matches including playing  minutes tonight and generally held his own in his first taste of international play.I still dont know why he was drafted so low Pick  or Pick  of Round  but Im glad hes with the Quakes.,MLS,d44ptxr,11,t5_2rbnb

His work rate is tremendous and I love his defense.  Maybe he just needs to catch a break here and there.   You are definitely right about the moments you identify  he had several plays especially against CR where his teammates let him down.

I dont think he could make more money moving the Rapids than he could selling it.When it becomes very difficult to get an MLS franchise and the MLS has a bigger TV rights deal you may see some movement but that is years down the road.The NHL for a few years was expanding heavily into sunbelt markets in a bid to get nationwide exposure and away from a strictly northeasternrustbelt regional sport. A lot of owners were eager to get into bigger better stadiums. As a planner I worked on a hockey stadium deal for a city in Orange County to accommodate the Ducks.

And why that might not be an acceptable stance?Are you aware of why NYCFC fans have a reputation for hooliganism? Its not all haters and circlejerk.

8005160,0,t1_d4ft0bf,Im being realistic not pessimistic. I clearly stated there is a slim chance that we win but  of the time the team with significantly better players in practically every position wins the game including the best player on earth. Also its not just about experience. I think Nagbe and Pulisic would give us a better shot at winning than Beckerman and Zusi. They can hold possession significantly better which is always a better level of protection than bunkering imo. If you play for the win you may end up tying. If you play for the tie youll likely end up losing. Parking the bus literally never works on a national level and almost never for clubs either. Another option is to try and bunker the first half with Beckerman and then subbing on Puli and Nags but thats really only viable if theyve not already scored on us.,MLS,d4fut9o,0,t5_2rbnb

8013587,0,t1_d4ge08k, of the time an instant replay would be shorter than the amount of time spent arguing with the referee on the more important calls like goals penalties and red cards. Many times watching the CL for example we saw the replay could clearly and easily make the right call only for the camera to go back and show the referee still trying to get everyone away from him. Video replay if used in predetermined specific situations ie only for a goal a penalty called or a ref suspecting a red card might be necessary for example would not slow down the game it might even accelerate it at times. The use of the tech would have to be narrow though to specific situations so its not used every other call.,MLS,d4gsvmv,2,t5_2rbnb

8049464,0,t1_d4krsuv,gt Goal line decisions touchline decisions and offside decisions are made more like computer code. Without visual confirmation you cant make the call. As an AR if you arent  sure you leave the flag down. That logic favors the defense on goal line decisions the offense on offside and both teams on the touchline.To continue the Gardner rant once you turn it to offside its pretty clear this is not real life.  Even is allegedly on. . . if you watch games you realize that if theres any doubt about that evenness the benefit of that doubt typically goes once again to the defenders.The common link is really defenseit is the balance of fear between allowing a goal that shouldnt have counted and disallowing one that should have.

I realise someone above put the rule up that says theres an exception if contact in negligible but I interpret that as a situation where opponents will pat each other on the head or put a hand on a cheek after a competitive play like you often see. Dempsey blatantly whacks the player on the face with one hand and then on the back of the head with the other in retaliation. Doesnt matter how soft he went down the action is still a red card any day of the week.

I think my best case scenario is a good winger who can maybe do the same things as Asprilla and Melano not world beaters but threats and then have Mattocks spell them when hes healthy.

And with no option to progress through promotion and relegation a team should be more concerned with itself than its league.That saying have its good and bad points. The prestige of the league do matter because that usually equal more exposure. Caring about the league you are in should be as equal as the team you are starting because that leagues structure reputation and management is important to how good you can make your team. Without prorel its all about every man for himself in the lower division. Without a division structure you have to make sure the club you start can withstand the problems within the broken soccer division system while trying to grow soccer within the community.

8428329,0,t3_4v2z2l,Thanks Robbie Keane and Bruce Arena.... They should really name this rule the Arena Rule. Primary reason this rule came to be was LAG benching their players from ASG so they were rested for league play. Keane was the most egregious offender  he got calls ups all  years in a row he skipped the game.  and  he then turned around and played  minutes for LAG  days later. Two of those three times he was also the ASG Coach andor Commissioner Pick and he still skipped. I  agree that the ASG is stupid but since it does exist it makes the league look like fools when the biggest players that casualnonfans tune in to see are no longer on the roster. So I understand where the league is coming from when they made the rule. I just think there needs to be more depth to the rule perhaps the rule should only be in effect if you played the game previous to ASG then skip ASG but wanted to play again the following game.As it stands someone who gets an ASG nomination that is close to recovering from an injury that may not be cleared to play by Thursday but ready for go by the weekend themtheir team are then unduly punished. Of course the real answer is to drop the ASG or change the schedulingformat of it so that it does negatively impact league play but the chances of that happening any time soon are small. I do hope they at least clean up this rule a bit. This is bullshit. edit This has been rumored for a week or so now for Liam. Im glad the story finally made its way here and in the media. The MLS corporate office needs to feel some heat for this rule and I was worried it was going to slip under the radar.,MLS,d5v2z1c,43,t5_2rbnb

How can you even make such a blanket statement for a good amount of people off that?For some reason people think the Northern Guard speaks for every City fan. Its frustrating for me seeing people base their entire view on City fans solely on shit like this There are so many differing opinions throughout our fan base. I dont even begin to try and represent the entire fan base so I dont see how after attending a few matches you can make such blanket statements.I at least hope you enjoyed yourself at the matches you went to.

8663786,0,t1_d6oj5d9,I think part of that is that there were several seasons where the MLS scheduled weekday LAG games in the fall and spring at the SHC. On schooldays there is a limit on parking and even seating to be less intrusive to the student on campus at CSUDH. Another reason is while all teams rely on attendance for a major revenue streams having a large number of STH ensure that the revenue stream is stable and reliable. The LAG have the largest LOCAL TV contract of any other MLS team including the NY teams pulling in more than the national TV contract the MLS shares with its  teams. So attendance is not crucial. As it is the LAG usually have attendance in the top  and frequently selling out the K seat stadium. While STH are a vital stable revenue stream for a lot of MLS teams it is less so for the Galaxy. One other reason is geographic. The Galaxy are now the only MLS team in YUGE city and draws fans from the OC to the Valley with some coming from central Cal and San Diego! As a former resident of So Cal you sometimes dont really want to make the drive from OC every other week. I once has a friend who had season tickets to the Lakers when they played at the Fabulous Forum he probably went to about  home games a season out of about  games so I usually got a hold of a few tickets per season. He was a lifelong Laker fan and as the forum sold out a lot he wanted to make sure he always had tickets for the games he wanted to watch usually against the Celtics New York teams and a few others with a lot of teams off his radar so to him buying a season ticket to ensure he couls watch only about  games per season made sense to him but that typical of LA sports fans.,MLS,d6olath,1,t5_2rbnb

Also this isnt a snarky question or anything I grew up in a small town in Texas only played football and basketball because the town didnt offer soccer. I feel that I do not have enough of a soccer background to really critique Jurgen yet. So I definitely want to reach out and ask questions so I have a better understanding of expectations.

BUT no one NO ONE on the team runs as much as this guy no one. not even Yedlin tracks back as fast to give the D some shape to run down players. The only fault in that is he is frequently out of position to make runs into the box or get and pass the ball in dangerous situations. Zardes is bigger and faster than Altidore and his work ethic on the field is second to none he never slacks and is among the first to offer Defensive cover. No wonder he is a JK favorite.

8888675,0,t1_d7g2a8x,Theres no particular looming problem. Anywhere up to  teams can be accommodated smoothly in a twoconference system. But if MLS ever does grow to the same size as other major American sports leagues  teams scheduling becomes difficult.Either it adds more games  as in a lot more like  more per year. Which would be madness.Or it has teams not play every other team every year. Which would be very regrettable.Or it gives up on playing homeandaway against every team in the same conference  in which case you might as well formalize it by just forming divisions. Then at least the homeandaway opponents are consistent from year to year.Or it goes to  conferences  in which case they probably need to bring back wildcard spots too and its not all that different from a divisional structure.Those are the only four options. Some sort of scheduling sacrifice has to be made if the league keeps growing past  teams and going to a divisional system at that point may be the best of a series of unfortunate options.,MLS,d7gak3w,4,t5_2rbnb

Carleton has played more with youth teams for the US than he has competitive games for Charleston. This was his first start. He clearly is small and struggled with physicality but is learning to adjust some. Still looks like a player. Otoo needed an adjustment period. The coachs comment was that he clearly has potential needed to get settled. It seems hes doing that as hes getting some bench minutes here and there.

Still you can go to games and see people in MetroStars stuff and shirts with Love the team hate the brand on them. It took me like two years to actually settle into rooting for the team even though there was no other option in the New York area.MLS actually folded very briefly in the early s. Red Bull bought the MetroStars in . Comparing MLS in  to the Bundesliga in  is laughable. Beyond the cultural and structural differences MLS wasnt very far removed from no longer existing when Red Bull showed up. And even if MLS doesnt fold they couldve folded the team or AEG pushes MLS to sell to someone who will move them.A better comparison would be Red Bull Munich a German hockey team and the New York Red Bulls.

8954969,0,t1_d7o5kh2,It has a big consequence.The seeded teams ALWAYS have the best easiest path to the quarters. When the US won the seed from England in  it needed to get by lower ranked Ghana to get to the quarters it didnt and possibly lost an opportunity to face a good but beatable Uruguay to get to the semis. I know wouldacouldashoulda  and it is all conjecture but the US has had to face Brazil and Belgium in rounds of  but had they been seeded would have faced Greece or Algeria and had a path far easier than not seeded. And while the luck of the draw will eliminate many good teams in the group stage seeding helps the good teams advance. A good team without a seed might and with a good draw may advance but a good tea witha seed and a good draw will advance to the semis.Of Course the US has to perform and be up to its capabilities. It needs to win against teams ranked lower and tie or occasionally beat higher seeded teams.Fifa has a nother way of seeding through confederations and if people wonder why we with  national fedeations and  teams in the World cup we seem to draw teams like Ghana and Germany on a regular basis but only occasionally see an Asian team or African team because its all done with the pot seeding where teams from the same confederation are never seeded in the same group except of course UEFA and each pot is seeded according to it FIFA rankings and because COCNCACAF has only  slots always share a pot with another confederation usually CONMEBOL but sometime CAF and being in the same  team pot means you are never going to face a team from another weak or similarly ranked confederation if you are in the same pot.It is no coincidence that the deck is stacked against unranked or unseeded teams its stacked again if you are in another confederation besides  UEFA.Not only is the ranking system by FIFA akin to gaming in Las Vegas where the house has has the odds the house here is UEFA but if you get into the bonus round the house will even increase its odds of winning.,MLS,d7o94ph,2,t5_2rbnb

When Miami FC had its really stupid and sexist come meet these hot girls at our game! promotion we were told up and down that the NASL had no power to influence the teams marketing.Then theres been their expansion policy.  Most leagues identify possible expansion cities and work with possible ownership groups.  The NASL were told doesnt do that seemingly preferring to sit back and wait for ownership groups to come to them.  Which is why theyre cannibalizing their own existing and struggling markets and fighting over Oklahoma City instead of making moves into underserved and potentially lucrative markets like Southern California or the Upper Midwest.I get the appeal of clubs being given as much free reign as possible.

9061440,0,t3_54ceg5,Its been said before but bears repeating changing a culture thats long fetishized an excessive and increasingly obsolete European model of youth development in a country not just as big as ours but as structurally limited as ours takes a long long time. Everyone wants MLS to be the best league in the world and the USMNT to be the best team in the world right away but no one wants the job of laying the groundwork and gradually building on top of it until either of those things are a reality. They get impatient and think that if we only copied Italy China Qatars profligate ways and allowed big markets like LA and NY to spend whatever they want on anyone they want well be the EPL the very next day. Or that if MLS clubs would just pay off amateur clubs that the paytoplay model would disappear and wed have as many successful academies as Spain Holland and Argentina combined. Or if we just had prorel teams would for some magical reason start playing their youth more even though the data coming out of leagues that do have it shits all over that notion.We are not England we are not Germany. We are the U.S. And we have the smartest people in the game from all over the world trying to help us solve the problem along with some of the best minds in American sports. Because to do it right you have to do it in a way that works in America not Europe.So while yes this is the internet and anyone like the author of this article is free to put on their soccer hat and pretend to be an expert lets all simply take a second to remember that everything thats happening in regards to the youth scene MLS and the national team talent pool etc. is all happening for a reason.

At least in North America taking on interns in positions that dont exist is honestly wasting your time. Unless you get lucky with an alumnus or a generally innovated secretary most of these emails and phone calls will go nowhere. Statistical analysis in sports is more than just recording who passed well or shot on target many stats guys I know record stats at practice game shootarounds etc. They have nearly unbridled access to these team events and unless a program already exists there is no reason to let a collegeaged kid or graduate enter that space. You can start by going to games and taking stats already but at every professional club there is someone doing that already. Hell even at AFCAA this summer we had at least one more likely two stat guys at every practice and game. Its a full time internship for many of them. The most foolproof way of getting in to the industry is giving up your own time to help the club. Thats true.

Reep is effectively the mastermind of socalled antisoccer fuck possession fuck back passing fuck dribbling fuck zonal marking... this is a sport about physicality and athleticism and god be damned if were going to let a team pass it around without repercussions. Its no coincidence that Vinny Jones rose to prominence with Wimbledon in the late s... his style of appallingly physical play was crucial to their success.And yes that was the mentality of the English sides early on in soccers history but England was also home to tactical revolutions like the WM and then further down the line the  diamond. As late as  Brian Cloughs Forrest were successfully playing a possession heavy  by having one of the wingers sit shallow and inside in a diamond formation.

9435690,0,t1_d9c0keh,Theres a few schools of referee thought. Some believe a ref should call a game the way THEY see fit from the start to the end.Others believe they have to adapt to the temperature of the match. This is why you see what youre talking about. For example a game between two physical teams. Ref wants them to be physical because if he doesnt fouls will be called too much and ruin the flow of the game so he lets things go. Later the story may be different because the players although they like being physical get pissed at the physicality ironic right? so now the ref shifts and starts cautioning for the same thing that happened before.Up to you what style suits you and works best.

9436313,0,t1_d9burmm,It has been FIFA and FIFA alone that has slowed the introduction of technology into the game. Both England and Germany both petitioned FIFA to have replays and goal line tech  years ago. No deal. There were a lot of purists with their head up their asses wanting to keep the sport traditional while all around them the athletes were introducing and using PEDs. and other performance enhancing techniques while the sports organizations like the IOC the UCI and FIFA turned a blind eye.There is a quasiargument that introduction of video and digital technology would put criticism onto the refs and officials for missing calls that the new technology will catch. Bullshit I do not think there is a ref in the world who would not want the backup that video tech would give them. They know they are not perfect and do the best under the circumstances. being a brilliant referee is a vetting process. You start with a hundred refs and at the end of  years you willhave about  of them that were good enough to survive any weeding process. Advance another  years and youll still have most of them. Most of the bad refs are weeded out if there is a vetting and weeding process in the first  games. The remainder WILL make mistakesand some will make big ones but generally they will be as good as you can make them. An introduction of some video tech will vet them faster as it will catch those who make a lot of mistakes.,MLS,d9c4a1t,2,t5_2rbnb

For example when the Yankees are in the World Series you suddenly see an influx of people who are displaying their New York roots. But when the Blue Jays get to the World Series no one is really coming out of the woodwork to show their Toronto roots. The essence of this question is who has the largest population of people who could become fans rather than who is already fans. Places like Seattle Portland Kansas City...etc. already have their fan base with little room to grow in comparison with New York and LA.

I can see them having the money to attract someone a lot better than Pirlo. And while well regarded in the soccer world it isnt like Pirlo is a household name. He isnt a Beckham Neymar Ronaldo or Messi. He isnt even a Rooney Bale or Aguero. TO me they have the money that they could be going and poaching some talented kids from Brazil some names off the quick search like Gabriel Jesus who their senior team just bought. Of course it would require a commitment but think about it from City Groups perspective. They would probably be spending the money anyway sign him and then loan him to City or another shady thing like that.

I think our Hypno Kit would have looked better with a stripped down fully orange badge.I think some badges lend themselves to monochrome better than others.  Ours is one of them because theres enough space around the monogram to give it definition.  Atlantas is a mess because the stripes in the background interfere with the beveling and it just becomes illegible  It works just fine in the original because the gold makes the A stand out from the red and black background but if the bevels are colored the same shade as the stripes it all blends together.

9777008,0,t3_5emfsf,Am I the only one who has never heard it called PampR?The article has some interesting history and could be a good read for those not already obsessed with American soccer.That being said their final suggestion that MLS extend its single entity status down to the lower leagues is laughable.  I dont think an MLS owner would ever agree to share their first division profits with second and third tier leagues.  Furthermore NASL has vehemently fought against singleentity and would never enter into this agreement.Beyond all of this the article fails to truly address the issue of scale.  It mentions that the US spans far greater territory than any European league but doesnt address why this is a concern for prorel or how prorel could be made to fit a country of this size.  The reason it creats an issue is balance.  MLS is sort of balanced as far as figuring out EastWest conferences.  However with an unrestricted prorel based off Supporters Shield standings whats to prevent a team in the west dropping and being replaced by a team on the east coast?  This could create massive balancing headaches for scheduling and travel purposes.I think the real point of the article is something the vast majority of us already know the US isnt ready for prorel.  We might after weve shored up the financials of the lower leagues divided each tier into subregions and analyzed a way of managing prorel within each region.,MLS,dai8cym,1,t5_2rbnb

Have you been watching Altidore and Gio this season? Gio put together  goals and  assists while missing  games of the season. Our  goals in the post season is the highest ever by  goals and we still have a match to play. We have the attacking advantage in pretty much every way.Onto point two there is a reason we had the second fewest goals against in the league. If you were just watching the Montreal game it gives you a bad perspective the reason they did so well against us is because their style almost perfectly counters ours. Its not that our defense is bad its that it puts a lot of pressure on our wings and almost entirely avoids the centre which is where we are most effective. The point I would argue FOR Seattle is that Morris is well suited to getting behind defenders but that will be trickey because that kind of style we are used to seeing and do pretty well against.Formation is a weird one for me because if you followed the Montreal game you would see we changed formations at least  times from a  to a  to a  One of our strengths is the ability to change formations on the fly and Vanney is extremely good at reading which formation is best and implementing it with subs,MLS,dapyyvu,2,t5_2rbnb

9880979,0,t3_5gw1vg,HONOURABLE MENTIONS   TroisRivieres PQ  A mediumsized independent city with limited sports competition. Former host of the TroisRivieres Attak of the CSL. Beyond an independent league baseball team a senior hockey team and racing there are no competition options. However the market is small and there is no viable stadium. Seems unlikely.   Markham ON  A huge Toronto suburb that has often been discussed in NHL terms. The biggest obstacle is the suburb disease discussed above and a lack of civic pride that comes with it. There are no competing options but Markham is very close to Vaughan and the site of TFC . Seems unlikely.   Barrie ON  Far enough away from Toronto to have its own unique identity Barrie is an intriguing option. There are few competition options outside of the CHL and the city is perpetually one of the fastest growing and youngest in Ontario. The Baycats independent baseball are the bestsupported IBL team which could be a good omen for local support. Nonetheless the market is small and the interest in soccer is unknown. Seems unlikely.   Windsor ON  A reasonably large city sitting in the Detroit metropolitan area. Unlikely that Detroit fans would cross the river when they have a team of their own. The city is large enough to support a variety of teams and the metropolitan area is roughly the same as Reginas. The League One Stars have existed for over a decade. A lack of major stadium is the primary obstacle. Seems unlikely.    Saskatoon SK  A large city that is capable of supporting a major league team National Lacrosse League and that has applied for NHL expansion in the past. However would significantly cut in to or eliminate the viability of a Reginabased Saskatchewan team. Seems unlikely.   New Westminster BC  A longdiscussed site for expansion of Whitecaps  the city is a viable option. A small population and proximity to Vancouver are significant hindrance. There are limited competing sports or soccer options potentially allowing more focus on a franchise. Seems unlikely.   St. Johns NL  A large independent city with a springsummer entertainment gap to be filled especially with the impending departure of the IceCaps. However the travel distance has previously been prohibitive to wellestablished leagues like the AHL and QMJHL and it seems unlikely that a new soccer team in a fledgling league could clear that hurdle. Seems unlikely.  ,MLS,davijs9,11,t5_2rbnb

Feels like ESPN reigned you in a bit on it but at least you put the thought out there.Secondly who gives a shit how the others do it?? I love watching fans of the four piss their pants as i explain relegation to them. Followed by a that will never happen. We just do things differently. Its one thing to have Villa near the top and then make an argument for him to take it. Its an entirely different thing to have that happen while completely snubbing Giovinco. Its actually a fucking insult. Thirdly this just smells of media bullshit. Once again a crappy system of voting by reporters some that follow futbol cuss they HAVE to having a strong say in the outcome. This looks as crappy as the voting system for the NCCA football playoffs which ESPN loves to tell us is a GREAT thing. This isnt against VILLA or for GIO. Its against the thought that THIS is the way to do it. So here is an ideaFans vote each week during the season. This makes the finalists.  of themCoaches and players vote after the playoffs. Thats right no media vote. There is then a big ceremony to give out all the awards. This way media gets what it wants...pics and tweets and a red carpet. So HOLLYWOOD. By the way as per the norm fans dont get to go to the ceremony. Biggest snub of all. However we can stand out in the cold and watch. Fourthly!!! Hold the ceremony in a fuck off large stadium so supporters can go also!!! Now that an idea!! And a hell of a party probably. Let it be known this was my idea.By the way....David Villa is winning a Landon Donovan award. Like i said we just do things differently. ,MLS,davq91z,-1,t5_2rbnb

10105710,0,t3_5klev3,Everyones going to argue that its unfair he was sacked before the transfer window but like I said in a previous comment yesterday Bob Bradley showed absolutely zero aptitude to succeed at a high level. In order to succeed at a high level you need to show some sort of trait where youre able to stretch your players thin and perform at a higher level than whats common for them. Bob Bradley took a squad that was average at best and had them performing consistently at a wellbelow average level. Lets look at the different eras Francesco GuidolinWinLoss  |  Team   |  Team ||Win | Burnley   | Swansea Loss | Swansea  | Hull Loss | Leicester  | Swansea Draw | Swansea  | Chelsea Loss | Southampton  | Swansea Loss | Swansea  | Manchester City Loss | Swansea  | Liverpool Bob Bradley WinLoss    |    Team     |    Team ||Loss  |  Arsenal   |   Swansea Draw  |   Swansea    |   Watford Loss   |   Stoke    |   Swansea Loss  |   Swansea    |   United Draw  |   Everton     |   Swansea Win  |   Swansea    |   Crystal Palace Loss  |   Tottenham   |   Swansea Win  |  Swansea  | Sunderland Loss  |  West Brom  |  Swansea Loss  |  Boro  |  Swansea Bob Bradleys tenure was plagued with letting up too many goals to weak sides.  goals to United and Arsenal? Thats understandable.  goals to West Brom Boro Palace and Stoke? Thats not anomalies anymore thats a pattern that needed to be mitigated and it wasnt. Someone in the rsoccer thread yesterday mentioned that relegation teams like Swansea need to focus on grinding out  draws or  draws...not running the scoreline up. It seemed that Bob was more focused on trying to get his team to score than organizing something from the back. Guidolins Swansea was not performing great but it wasnt performing awful either. Bottom line Bobs defensive woes cost him his job in England. I dont think any club in a top  league is going to take a chance on him anytime soon. Hes going to have to recoup in a lesserlower league somewhere or manage a NT again.,MLS,dbosaj0,88,t5_2rbnb

Its not even close. . Any  MLS teams make less compared to other clubs around the world represents a drag on the profitability of selling players which drives decisions around developing and playing youth. Add to that the fact that theres no functioning domestic transfer market and no competition for players and you have a further chilling effect on player values.. Is that similar to youth incentives that drive the entirety of the global soccer market? Has LA been profitable in its youth dev efforts? None of this works.

That said hes arguably the highest rated Canadian U outside of Davies and Tabla so who knows. Assuming NASL and FC Edmonton are around for  I dont think this is a good move for Shome. A few points. Sources. That is all. Sabetti is pretty reliable but still....sources.... There is already a tweet from Global Premier Management denying this mentioning that the first GA Canada signing is a striker from the GTA. . Shome is currently a second year engineering student at the University of Alberta in addition to his role with FC Edmonton.

10498685,1,t3_5qcisl,I could see Pontius being cut. He had a great year with the Union he was tremendous at finishing the rare chance he would get in a game. But he also had a tendency to disappear in a match and really be a nonfactor if he wasnt getting the ball around the box. And his future potential with the Nats is probably low. Mainly I just hope Rosenberry stays and gets some legit playing time. Ive been saying it since a month into last season Rosenberry is straight up the best RB in the USMNT pool. I know Chandler has been playing extremely well in Germany this year and Ive read a lot about him being one of the best RBs in Germany right now but he just has not showed that for the US.Yedlin still has great upside if he can iron out his game more. But I still think the one thing he has over Rosenberry is elite speed. However Rosenberry isnt slow at all and in all other aspects of the game be it defending technical ability passing twofootedness positioning etc. everything Ive seen from Rosenberry tells me Rosenberry is easily better at all of those things than Yedlin.The wildcard now is Zusi. I can actually see him becoming a very good RB hes got the skillset to do it its just a matter of how good of a defender he can be. But more specifically on Rosenberry I am fully aware that hes only had one professional season and it was only at the MLS level. All other candidates trump him in experience and level of competition. Rosenberry might just be overwhelmed by higher competition but hes got the tools and one of his greatest assets is just how composed he is at all times. He was not overwhelmed as a rookie after winning the starting job in preseason. He played every minute last year in MLS and I can only think of a handful of flubs or rookie moments he had in the whole season.I would honestly be shocked if Rosenberry didnt prove to be at least a quality RB option for the US as his career progresses.   ,MLS,dcy4xcn,2,t5_2rbnb

To me its up there with Moon as the best scifi of the new millennium.Best new scifi might actually be Rogue One which I really really enjoyed after hating The Force Awakens which was worse than the prequels it was very nice to like a Star Wars film again.Arrival had a ton of potential but Amy Adams amp Forest Whitaker were both terrible and the script was more about faith than competence. I love filmsshowswhatever where the foundational feature of the characters is that theyre ubercompetent. Thats what elevates great scifi films like  and Alien  theres no dumb blundering into bad situations youre never sitting there thinking why would they do that???? Every character is smarter and braver and more ingenious than you and shit still happens.So even though I had problems with how Arrival played out I thought Villanueve had a great eye for setting up a shot used the camera well and didnt have his characters overexplain everything. Im cautiously optimistic about his hand on the till for both the Blade Runner sequel and the Dune reboot.Also... maybe TV is the place for scifi these days?

If i walked up to someone from America and said hey ill give you  pesos per WEEK to wear a Chivas jersey......i wonder how many will say no. So to my point. Money dictates. Again this is total speculation on both our parts. Im sure if we asked him he would say NI MADRE. However with the contract in front of him and that first weeks pay in a brief case next to him eeeehhhhhhh a lo mejor si??? I think for fans its different cuss we dont get paid. We invest in it with little pay back most of the time.  win followed by  losses to us is just a slump. Shit look at Chicago Fire fans.  shit years that follow several mediocre years. But there we are holding onto hope while paying money for a bus ride out to a pitch to buy  worth of rice piss water per can and yell on OUR team!!!!  if imported. Its what it is.

10707342,0,t1_ddkd8en,Thats a valid criticism.I still maintain that we should have the th official in charge of video replay.

More importantly its pretty hard to get it wrong when youre watching replays from  angles so its perfect for that role.Hopefully well avoid more examples of odd refereeing like the Battle of Starfire and Dempseys infamous notepad assault.,MLS,ddkds16,18,t5_2rbnb

10769695,0,t1_ddqsvtr,It isnt a promise right now and theyre still doing it.Reminder there are NO guarantees that Cincy Sac Nashville Charlotte St. Louis or Tampa are getting a shot in MLS yet ALL of them have some plans regarding infrastructure at the D level anyways. Theyre not going off the promise of promotion theyre building the strongest brands they can with the finances they can so they can pitch it to MLS and win based off fan response. Just look at the different approaches between the straighttoMLS teams and the USLtoMLS teams in this round of expansion and youll see a group of USL teams that are driving the second division forward and Id argue that theyd have less of an incentive to take the kind of shots theyre taking if they could just get promoted off of pitch performance alone.Of course thats the ideal and Im not arguing that. I just think that the current approach is having an unintended positive effect on the second division since the competition isnt just about who can build the best squad but who can build the best club and still have enough money on deck to front the m and however much itll cost to buildexpand a stadium. Which means they have to be smart and have big pockets all of which is absolutely essential until we get to a point where league profits are coming from TV deals sponsorships and more. The increase in TAM increase in spending across the league suggests this is happening and to some of us its happening faster than we expected and its beautiful to watch.Meanwhile D is pumping out expansion candidates every day and nearly every major metro center has a team within a few hours drive.

Combined they rank st behind Sactown Cincy Dayton  Combined . Sacramento . Saint Louis I get that you probably think Im just choosing to combine Dayton because its advantageous and you could arbitrarily combine other markets. But the Census dept considered combining the metros in the last census and will do so next time aroundedit I know thats not the same as DMA. But the DMA is really small for a city the size of Cincy especially considering the corporate base  Fortune   additional fortune  the population of the combined CSA will rank th behind Denver.

Tyler Adams was immense as was Justen Glad. I think if we do make it to the World Cup that we may have a serious chance at making a deep run. This team is missing Perez Wright Mckennie Taitague Akale Olosunde CCV Carleton Koreniuk Parks etc etc etc. Assuming none of those guys get a chance at the Gold Cup dont think they will then we have a serious chance at being incredibly dangerous. ,MLS,deb526e,12,t5_2rbnb

If the officials have any suspicion that those kind of visas will be misused they have all the right to deny them...As for my Colombian family is concerned...they tried twice in the nineties to no avail they didnt take it personal...In  they were granted a  year multiple entry visas which are great...They come over once every three  four years to visit their visas have been renewed since ...Which means if you utilize you tourist visa the way youre supposed to the US government will trust you permanently and will continue extending your visa indefinitely...,MLS,dec72ca,29,t5_2rbnb

And if small teams do get promoted like Bournemouth into the PL then good for them! Look how exciting it was for Leicester to win the league!PR means new teams playing each other each year it means new places to visit to watch your team it means shit that constantly finishes down the bottom have to answer for poor performance it means that well run teams get a shot in the top flight. It means a more even standard across  teams instead of having  really good teams and then loads of absolute shit. More teams means more players. More players getting a chance at a higher level. Bigger pool of players means potentially a better USMNT... all possibles no definites but definitely possible!And a big team in the second tier is brilliant. The fans get so bent out of shape about it. Were too good to be relegated etc. Even though quite clearly you arent too good... you finished bottom.Juventus got relegated a few years ago for match fixing. It was brilliant.

11104918,0,t3_5y1rps,Reasonable article overall. Not saying it wont work just that there are questions. I do think the HUGE difference is the low overhead of an MLS team compared to a MLB team at this point.

Minnesota should be a club that builds itself around smart teamcentric soccer but at the end of the day they should be able to get punched in the face by the elements and opponents giving it back just as well.

11138816,0,t3_5z1lqx,Minnesota made some moves that looked good on paper but havent really worked for a few years. They went out and acquired alot of journeymen European players  from second tier leagues that really arent better than MLS and expected them to be difference makers on a squad that contained alot of decently good but not great MLS players and some NASL standouts like RamirezIbarra etc. DefensivelyDemidov looks bad and falls in the vein of other bad centerback signings in recent years like Kantari Mateos S. Taylor etc. Schuller  doesnt look like a diference maker in midfield and the triad of SchullerWarnerSaeid looks like three journeyman MLS midfielders trying to control play they cant. Calvo might be alright he mostly just seems invisible however he probably should be playing fullback over Jermaine Taylor who has been poor for years now and Davis seems out of his depth. They threw away an okay if not great MLS proven keeper in Atinella for pretty much nothing and replaced him with a past it goalkeeper from Sweden who really looks to be sliding on a downhill trajectory of ability. Offensively Ramirez seems to make some good runs but he needs more support than he is getting Molino I think is good but I dont agree with the idea he is capbable of leading an MLS offense he seems like  he is a great secondary creator and attacker but not dynamic enough as the head string puller. Venegas is a bad winger so stop playing him there and he will get more productive. Ibarra I dunno if he will get up to speed and be effective in MLS in time before he loses his spot to a panic signing in the summer. CoachingI didnt think Heath was that great at Orlando and am a little surprised he ended up with the job since at that point Sigi was available who has flaws but you know actually built a winning expansion team in Seattle. Heath had some bad luck in Orlando. Yet he built a terrible defense that never clicked threw away Aurelian Collin who before was and remained a good MLS centerback outside of Orlando converted Brek Shea from a winger into a shitty fullback and I assume was at least somewhat involved in signing some pretty bad defenders like Mateos to plug gaps. If you werent going to spend money on flashy attackers you need a solid defense to win in MLS and Heath has never built a strong defense. Even if Sigi had no interest there were other coaches who had decentish defensive records in the league and Kreis was available for months after Minnesota was announced as an expansion side until he ultimately replaced Heath at Orlando. ,MLS,deuknsb,43,t5_2rbnb

11205813,0,t1_df1z4rq,Here are just a few that I can think of for youYoung Attacking Team FC Dallas If you want a young athletic team that plays the way a Ferrari drives these are your guys. Three In The Back Toronto FC This team is also fun because they have superstar goalscorers up top in Giovinco and Altidore. Best Defensive Team Colorado Rapids Their defensive acumen is aided by their home field being a mile above sea level.Great Wing Play Columbus Crew For years this team has been built off the play of their wingers and their no.  Federico Higuain. High Press Enthusiasts NY Red Bulls This team has mastered forcing turnovers from the high press and turning them into chances on offense. Build From The Back NYCFC Patrick Vieira has his team methodically build out of the back waiting for the time when Pirlo can spring the attack with a key pass to either the wingers or David Villa. Overall Solid Team Seattle Sounders They have talent all over the roster including star players Clint Dempsey and Nico Lodeiro they play a  and they just won the MLS Cup. Ballers On A Budget Chicago Fire or Philadelphia Union Both teams have been making shrewd player signings and have built respectable rosters. Exciting Young Attackers Houston Dynamo There seems to be a new era starting in Houston where new head coach Wilmer Cabrera has brought in two young dynamic attacking wingers to compliment his talisman no.  Eric Cubo Torres. The rest of the team just defends and then gets the ball to the feet of one of these young attackers in isolation. Counter Attackers Montreal Impact Theyve made a living off of the counter and have arguably the leagues best counter attacking player in Ignacio Piatti. Spend Big on Young South American Attackers ATL United This is a new team in the league and they have made an impression. With Tata Martino as their head coach and plenty of talent in the attack this team may end up having the most exciting attack in the league. There are plenty of other teams that are worth mentioning Portland deserves a shout for their superb attacking pieces as well but that should be a good start for you. I hope you enjoy getting into MLS!,MLS,df25xwa,9,t5_2rbnb

Also during half time I was running around the soda can trying to find this fabled oz  beer and swear I did two laps. Eventually I found the single craft beer stand that had the big cans and tried to take a picture of two metro SG guys wearing old metrostars stuff. They had such a strong jersey go fack yahself accent and were not amused when I drunkenly asked and they declined. To make up for it I bought them both beers and then they turned really friendly after that. I like to think somewhere theres two NJ guys who think seattle fans arent too bad.

11287006,0,t1_dfanq3p,I think looking at and taking into account the last  games is a perfect compromise.  Obviously were too early in the season for that but in general.The idea is supposed to be who would you not want to play this week.  Id be fine playing a team on a LLLLW.  Which is why looking only  week isnt very good.However.  Id also be fine taking on a typically good team on a DDLLD and would not look forward to a bottom table team who happens to be on an unbeaten streak.  Basically you have to look at current form.  Extended results dont mean much and  game doesnt mean much ,MLS,dfbd6ez,2,t5_2rbnb

11287278,0,t1_dfbdupt,I dont see the exact similarity between Weston and Yedlin. Yedlin was transferred to Spurs through the FIFA means of transfer whereas Weston just signed with Schalke cuz he was not contracted anywhere. And Yedlins case is about sharing the collected transfer fee with his youth clubs from MLSs perspective. Tottneham did what they were supposed to do MLS is responsible for paying out the solidarity payments. I see the similarities but I dont think the Yedlin case is identicaly to set the precedence for Westons transfer to Schalke transfer is in quotes because he didnt transfer in the traditional FIFA sense. ,MLS,dfbeagi,1,t5_2rbnb

11289791,0,t3_61430s,The article sounds like sour grapes. None of this is new. If you look at the pricing for the Centenario and the ICC they are all in the same range.If the ticket sales for the Miami event are solid you can say there is a good market for soccer there. Many are saying there isnt or at least for MLS soccer. Maybe in  this was true but the gameday experience the MLS and soccer fandom  has grown tremendously in the US.Just go but a SuperBowl NCAA or NBA Finals and see what the ticket prices are!.About  years ago I paid around . a ticket to see Metallica at the Tucson Fairgrounds festival seating where I was almost right on the stage. Philly and Lincoln Financial want  a ticket for seating near the stage in the upcoming Metallica Tour date in Philly. Thats a huge difference in ticket pricing! But its supply and demand apparently Philly Metallica fans have much more money or want to be fleeced just as much as soccer fans in Miami. What is the difference ? What constitutes a blatant cash grab or a unique opportunity to see  worldwide icons? Phiilyvoice thinks they know. They do not!There is just as much hypocrisy in sports an in music in newsprint or TV journalism. I expect Philly has thrown as many rocks as any other glass house city.,MLS,dfbojnl,6,t5_2rbnb

The problem was that we had a moderately talented roster that is far superior to anything the program has had at its disposal in history and we were getting exponentially worse over time. No one is saying we dont have mediocre depth. Klinsmann wasnt necessarily wrong in critiquing the talent pool when compared to the top  teams in the world.

11448553,0,t1_dfswlxa,What exactly constitutes as a retirement signing though?Id say that at the time of the INITIAL signing the designated player would have to be  years old or older. Now looking at the current DPs in MLS that narrow down the names quite a bit. The players who fit this criteria are as followsYear Signed as DP | Player | Club | Age Signed as a DP||| | Clint Dempsey | Seattle Sounders |  | David Villa | New York City |  | Kaka | Orlando City |  | Andrea Pirlo | New York City FC |  | Tim Howard | Colorado Rapids |  | Jelle Van Damme | LA Galaxy |  | Bastian Schweinsteiger | Chicago Fire | So there are  players in the league altogether who are currently DPs who were initially signed when they were  or over.I thnk we can narrow down the definition of a retirement signing even more. Jelle Van Damme was not initially signed as a Designated Player and his salary will be brought down later this year with TAM. ITs fair to say that hes not really coming here for a last paycheck seeing as hes not really making that much more money than he would be making in Belgium. So we can cross him off the list.Clint Dempsey and Tim Howard are two MLS developed Americans who were bound to come back to MLS either way. Its pretty commonplace for international footballers to return to their home league at the end of their careers similar to how Tevez returned to Boca Juniors or Dirk Kuyt returning to Feyernoord. The players who make such moves arent just coming home for a last paycheck they make these moves out of respect to their boyhood clubs and the leagues which developed them into the player they are today. So with that being said that leaves four oldies remaining on the list Kaka Villa Schweinsteiger and Pirlo. Out of them only Schweinsteiger was signed after .Now do four retirement age signings really turn the entire league into a  retirement league especially when you consider that the majority of Designated Players were signed in their prime or as Young DPs? This demographics shift becomes even more apparent when you look at the  offseason  young DPs  if you consider Joao Plata who was initially signed as a young DP  inprime DPs and one oldie in Schweinsteiger.Heres a compilation of all the current players in MLS who have at some point been signed to a young DP contract.Year Signed as DP | Player | Club | Age Signed as a DP||| | Joao Plata| Real Salt Lake |  | Matias Laba | Vancouver Whitecaps |  | Erick Torres | Houston Dynamo |  | Mauro Diaz | FC Dallas |  | Fanendo Adi | Portland Timbers |  | Juan Ramirez | Colorado Rapids |  | Mauro Manotas | Houston Dynamo|  | Bryan Rochez | Orlando City |  | Carlos Rivas | Orlando City |  | Lucas Melano | Portland Timbers|  | Diego Rubio | Sporting Kansas City|  | Carlos Gruezo | FC Dallas |  | Hector Villalba | Atlanta United |  | Anibal Chala | FC Dallas |  | Michael Almiron | Atlanta United |  | Alberth Elis | Houston Dynamo |  | Albert Rusnak | Real Salt Lake |  | Cristian Colman | FC Dallas |  | Josef Martinez | Atlanta United | You decide.,MLS,dftomjb,1,t5_2rbnb

Which in my opinion is a bad deal for them.If MLS leaves St Louis in  years what would the city need a faded k seat soccer specific stadium that they still owe  million on for? St Louis tax payers are being sold a depreciating asset so the owners can buy an appreciating asset. Its a bad deal. If the MLS in STL is such a slam dunk the owners should be able to finance build and pay taxes for their own stadium. If public investment is indeed required it would be better if the city and the owners together shared the upside of the franchise along with the downside of the stadium. ,MLS,dfueh7i,2,t5_2rbnb

11478852,0,t1_dfwxkig,Thanks for the good feedback. Youve correctly identified one problem with using teamprovided capacities which are often designed with at least one eye on PR. I recognize this shortcoming and dont love assigning teams to Eliminated when I know this could change down the road.The challenge obviously is choosing a standard which we can apply consistently across all teams. Youve come up with a good one and Ive seriously considered it before. That comes with its own challenges though as wed make errors on the other side for example both Vancouver amp Seattle have games with substantially higher attendances in their buildings than are possible for a normal game. We could be  home games from the end of the season and Vancouver say might need to average K to hit a target. In theory Vancouver has hit K so it would be possible but we all know they average more like K. So while your suggestion would improve forecasting for some teams it would degrade it for others. I strive to keep these categories mathematically consistent on the one hand while also being realistic.Another challenge would be retaining accurate records of the maximum current capacity in a given building. Just keeping track of teamdefined capacities is challenging enough and thats with the aid of official team announcements. If a stadiums capacity changes due to construction Dallas is currently lower than normal for example and teams will occasionally announce that theyve squeezed in a few hundred more seats then the previous number is no longer valid  and then what do we go by?Similar to your idea Ive thought about using the maximum crowd size a team has shown in the current season. I think this might be the best compromise between the other two and would be perhaps a better predictor by virtue of eliminating the effect of different levels of fan engagement in previous years. The challenge there would be in automating this calculation in what is currently a static formula in my Excel table.What do you think? Im open to the idea just not convinced of how to implement it.,MLS,dfx4hfe,2,t5_2rbnb

11497831,0,t1_dfydcik,If we got rid of allocation money and DPs and just increased the cap every player in the league would want a piece of the new money available. You can say just replace them with better players but there really arent any better American players who want to play here. Yeah we could make the teams better if we didnt bother limiting foreign players but that would take away a lot of the appeal of the league for me. I like watching guys I can relate more to get their start here. And we would never get the big marketable stars because it wouldnt make sense to build a roster that way.   The cap keeps salaries in check and keeps everybody on a fairly even playing field. GAM gives something for teams to trade other than just players and draft picks which can actually be used for competitive reasons. TAM does the same thing but can only be applied to players who wouldnt be in the league without it so current players cant use it in negotiations for a higher salary.  The discovery list prevents bidding wars between MLS clubs by ensuring only one team can negotiate with a player at a time.    The rules might seem weird and convoluted at first but when you start to understand how they all fit together they actually make a lot of sense.  Most of the fan suggestions are shortsighted and poorly thought out.    The ability of the average American players coming through is the main thing other than money holding the league back. The major outliers will still end up in Europe where the highest level of competition is but the league has shown that it will continue to increase spending in order to keep up with the general level of American players available.  At this point allowing much more spending on the general roster would either mean substantially overpaying American players or removing a lot of them from the rosters.,MLS,dfza1mb,1,t5_2rbnb

11656213,1,t1_dgh8ayo,I think rMLS and at large the whole American soccer community is starting to realize that everything we have been saying about this club has been on the money since the beginning. First they doubted we would be our own club and not some reboot of Chivas.Then they said we couldnt get a downtown stadium.Then they said the Galaxy would never give us an opening like New Jersey Red Bulls did for NYCFC but this year Galaxy attendance is down over  and what fans remain are growing angry over their many bad decisions like replacing Bruce Arena with a joke coach who couldnt even get it done in USL and trading a club legend to Houston.Now the only thing left is proving well be better than Atlanta which to me is actually the easiest part. No offense to Atlanta but LA done right is LA done right. And if Seattle marked the beginning of MLS . and Atlanta marked MLS . then its only fitting that MLS . be started by us.

There just arent that many clubs with sustainable setups compared to the amount of colleges with sustainable setups that also have the academic upsideit also helps with recruiting that coaches can get mediocre students into prestigious schools which is an important factor to consider. Also Youth clubs are designed specifically to send kids to colleges and they pride themselves on this.  year old kids dont know what they are doing. College coaches are also like magicians when it comes to convincing soccer players to come to school X where they can play soccer at a high level and get their nice safety net degree.

To an Auburn fan beating Alabama means more than playing the Patriots in any hypothetical situation. To a smaller school playing a bigger school means more than some silly notion they have to play a pro team to matter.  College sports is a different mentality and probably the closet we have to lower division soccer.   Swindon Town is never going to win the premier league and will never offer the level of play English fans can see watching Man U and Chelsea on their televisions every week. But that doesnt mean local fans should stop supporting them. That is like college sports. It is not about being the best.
