4994149,0,t3_3e19dc,Your best bet and value for money is probably going to be a  channel Dahua or Hikvision NVR    a tb hard drive    would be better. Then cameras to suit. A fixed lens p mp dahua dome camera is around  indoor or outdoor. What I would do is sit down with your parents find out what they want to cover important areas etc then price it up for them. I work a lot with CCTV in stores and my guess is that when your parents see the cost they will prioritize pretty quickly. They will probably decide that  cameras is enough  The main thing you want to achieve is getting a good detailed face shot when a customer comes in. So a decent camera looking at the entry door is a good idea. There will be a lot of light changes on an entry door so you want to make sure that it can handle different light levels. A lot of cheaper cameras fail miserably when there is bright light pointing at them. A camera that has WDR wide dynamic range is best. You also need to think about getting decent cameras for the areas where money is handled  stored. For the rest of the shop  aisles etc p cameras will probably be fine.You can get some pretty good deals on aliexpress as the gear comes  from dealers in China. You have to concede that you probably arent going to get warranty coverage if anything fails though. Lots of sellers on Aliexpress have decent warranty periods but you have to remember that if you want to claim you have to pay to ship the goods back to China. Let me know if you want any more help. ,cctv,cunzbrr,1,t5_2qupd
