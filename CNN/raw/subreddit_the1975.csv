6716167,0,t1_d0dwwq9,This coming so soon after Jamie tweeted about preordering or buying the album the first week so it can get to number  makes me suspect its related to that. Adele broke a record held by NSync since  by withholding her album from Spotify. So yeah its about money but its also about charts and such. Spotify plays a really interesting role in the current music industry and I dont think the artists and labels have really figured out how to work with it yet. Its great for general people but its rough on sales and charts and revenue. Heres an interesting piece from the New Yorker about the Adele situation and possible impacts of artists withholding releases. ,the1975,d0e0d2u,4,t5_2x80q

Its understood that their relationship didnt go much further than a week long fling after a postshow hookup est. . Halsey wrote a few personal posts about it on her tumblr but theyve long been taken down. Halseys recent cover of The Sound got positive feedback from Jamie on Twitter and she had posted a couple selfies with Matty last Dec so its safe to assume theyre still friends at the moment ,the1975,d1fuz1k,2,t5_2x80q

10995435,0,t3_5wrpdg,Again can we stop using the word confirm when that couldnt be further from the truth? Were talking about a single emoji here not a confirmation of any kind...,the1975,deear1p,2,t5_2x80q

11237771,0,t3_60dmco,Im pretty sure that Theres a Honey is the only song they have released. They may have had other songs before they signed to Dirty Hit but I doubt they will be allowed to play other songs if they have been released under another label. Hopefully they release some more stuff soon though and I hope they make their way to Aus eventually I think they would be great live!!,the1975,df5sa8z,2,t5_2x80q

11330021,0,t3_61oute,Yeah camping out is the best option to getting front row I know that people will be camping out for a lot of shows depending on weather.Again depending on weather make sure you dress comfortably rather than fashionable. It sounds bad but if you are camping out you dont want to be stuck in uncomfortable clothes and you dont want to get too hotcold waiting in line you will be sitting down for at least  hours so you dont want to wear pants that will cut off your circulation or anything and you want to have comfortable shoes as well you dont want to be wearing heels Im not sure on your gender to camp on the street. If you can park you car close to the venue maybe even take a change of clothes. Have camping clothes and then concert clothes. Having a car or someone who can drive to pick up your stuff would be handy for camping out since you can take a lot of stuff to keep you comfortable blankets chair pillows but then be able to throw it in the car when its time to go in rather than leaving it on the street.Also stay hydrated and fed!! I know a lot of people dont drink before shows because they are scared of needing the bathroom but I promise that its better to have energy than pass out before they even come on! It happens to so many people because they dont eatdrink in line and then they pass out before they even come on stage and then end up missing the showhaving a awful time.Be prepared for a TON of pushing. Their crowds are absolutely brutal in terms of pushing. That being said they put on an incredible show and its so worth going despite the pushing. I personally prefer the back of the venue so I can face with friends but I know some people just prefer the front.I hope you have an amazing time!!!,the1975,dfg8m4b,4,t5_2x80q
11394443,0,t3_62lqb0,I think I mentioned something similar when it came out but I dont like the Somebody Else video. I hoped for a really cheesy cliche love story kinda video. As in a long deep passionate slomo kissing scene as Adam drops that guitar solo near the end.,the1975,dfnjluz,1,t5_2x80q
