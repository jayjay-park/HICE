322737,0,t3_1xs1ey,My aunty does sometimes not for like food or anything just looking for stuff she can use. Before you read this just know she is super strange so lets just get that out of the way first.There was someone that lived nearby her that died and whoever the house went to decided just to throw everything out into a skip. she found the skip and decided to poke around to see if she could find anything useful.Turns out when they threw out everything they actually threw EVERYTHING. This guys entire life was in there from birth certificates to a divorce certificate. Pretty much every important document you could think of from the last  years. There was hundreds of old records from the s and s personal letters a few paintings which she got valued turns out they are all worth a small fortune each and a shit tonne more. It is kind of sad that his loved ones if he even had any decided to throw all this stuff out but my aunty believes it was a landlord that emptied the house and he was estranged from his kids and family due to remarrying after his first wife. She knows this because she has essentially put his entire life together via documents and personal letters she found in there. I guess since he seemed like a lonely old man and she has taken this on to sort of honour him so someone remembers his life because no one else seemed to care even though she never even met him.Im unsure what to think about it but I guess it was better than everything just ending up at the tip.,melbourne,cfe80a1,8,t5_2qkhb

It is detrimental in that a lot of small growth will be eaten and destroyed soil will be compacted and habitats will be disrupted.  However by running these large animals through the often dense scrub you are aiding in dead plant material being decomposed.  Branches and sticks that lay on the ground are broken into smaller sticks that will decompose faster than if they were left alone partially rotten larger pieces of wood will be broken apart allowing more air to flow hastening decomposition.  Obviously no the cattle will not eat sticks or dead leaves and I dont think anyone thinks that however native grasses will be eaten and that will reduce embers starting fires and fire fronts jumping.,melbourne,cfvocpd,0,t5_2qkhb

661344,0,t1_cgfevl6,I totally respect that. Especially as you are focussing on the aesthetic nature of the suburb and not the inhabitants. I personally enjoy the italian greek lebanese etc. culture and find the people who live there so friendly. I love Coburg Lake and Meri Creek and seeing so many people enjoy themselves outdoors. I also love trying new food at the cafes and restaurants and exploring the many leash free dog parks with my canine companions. Every suburb has its fair share of dbags and unpleasant people so when I encounter these types I dont let it shape my view of the place. I also love Brunswick. Yes it has a lot of pretentious people but it also has so much to offer someone such as myself and my friends. The Brunswick Green The Mess Hall Sparta Place just to name a few favourites. Both suburbs also have this lovely culture of people who have had a number of generations grow up there and a real pride in their area. My neighbourhood has a real community feeling that I really felt was lacking when I lived in Brunswick and people look out for each other which is terrific. But I do agree that from Moreland Rd and beyond up Sydney Road into Coburg it can look a bit bare and at times ugly. ,melbourne,cgfg0h2,2,t5_2qkhb

Also if you have an iPhone you can download the remote app hook it up to their wifi and pick the songs that play over the speakers.The biggest issue is the main area is dimly lit for the most part which means that socially awkward types like myself will find it easier to melt into the background at will but it may not be so great for everyone else.,melbourne,cgh0iuv,8,t5_2qkhb

Those who need to go to what was the city loop will catch a tram UP St Kilda Road  which in morning peak doesnt have a huge volume of passengers compared to Southbound.  Along that line its only a short walk to anywhere thats near Parliament Flinders Street Melbourne Central or Melbourne University.  It may mean a slightly longer trip to Melbourne Uni but not a massive amount of time.CraigieburnUpfield needs a massive upgrade.  There needs to be a link between Upfield and Roxburgh Park so that travelers can use both lines to service Roxburgh Park Craigieburn and the new areas that will develop in the next  years at Merrifield and Donnybrook. A massive parking area is really needed at Roxburgh Park to service that station as Craigieburn simply does not have the space and is more central to more residents. Give us a  space carpark and itll allow people to drive from all areas to there to park and catch the train in.  Currently station carparks are full by am.,melbourne,chcgvul,1,t5_2qkhb

1096152,0,t3_26o56f,It might not be all that close to you but the Albert Road Clinic has excellent psychiatric services. Ive been a patient there for  years and never had a bad experience with them. Theyre not the cheapest though my visits cost about  per session with Medicare paying me back about ish. Youll need to get a referral from a GP if you want to be able to claim costs back from Medicare.Below is a copypaste of what I normally recommend to anyone asking about this stuff some of it might not apply to you Start with a regular GPDr preferably one that youve seen before ideally one that you trust. They will talk to you about some stuff  symptoms your sleep patterns general mood they might even have a survey to fill in. Answer honestly even if its embarrassing  the doc is not judging you they just need to make sure they refer you to the right specialist. In Australia a GP can prescribe basic medication themselves though its usually best to start with counselling before taking meds. Know the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist psychologists are best for counselling CBT or therapy psychiatrists are best for medication oversight. Its rare to meet someone who is brilliant at both and both types of treatment are valuable depending on what you need. If youre prescribed meds they can take a long time to start working   weeks is not uncommon  and some people are not responsive to meds at all. All meds have annoying sideeffects and if theyre too unpleasant talk to your doc about changing meds. If youre taking meds for a long time years they will become less effective and will need the dosage increased or a different med. Never ever stop taking meds suddenly. Setting up a easy way of reminding yourself when to take them is good  I use an alarm on my phone when it goes off I take my pills easy. Exercise is important but dont think it has to be at a gym or even that strenuous. I tried the gym and it didnt work for me. Walking along my local river or playing with my cat does so I usually walk for an hour a day then play with my cat. Its not actually the exercise that helps its that Im processing the environment around me while interacting with things. The gym couldnt give me that the river and my cat does. Try a bunch of activities and see what works for you.Good luck!,melbourne,chsvxpl,8,t5_2qkhb

I understand encouraging people to walk or use public transport in one instance I can recall a bus stop and a tram m away were used as a thin excuse for a developer to build  apartments some of them without any parking at all. I drive past this particular block regularly and there are apartments that have never been rented or sold no one lives in them because of a total lack of amenity. Come to think of it thats just a microcosm of the rest of my suburb where you can walk past rows upon rows of houses that no one lives in. Brand new never lived in with  feet of grass growing in the yard.I was recently speaking to a developer about the reduction in size of apartments around the k mark theyve taken sqm out of the floorplan on each apartment to more intensively build because of rising costs.

By your logic anyone who decides whatever they do to be an artform could choose to cover anything they want in whatever they want since art is subjective. Heck I could declare I love negative space and paint over every building I come across a solid pink color and call it art and I doubt anyone would be ok with that.

Most of the time doing well in business is a lot more than working hard its being able to communicate well and work well with other people. Having a large social circle and knowing the right people demonstrates that you can do this. I agree with what youre saying that there are a lot of idiots that earn a lot of money but I think people undervalue how much being able to sell yourself and meet people is worth.,melbourne,cjwhaxm,5,t5_2qkhb

Theres a giant swath of the country called tornado alley where tornadoes regularly appear out of nowhere and kill hundreds. Imo this makes the entire region unlivable. The gulf coast and Florida get hurricanes and floods. At least these can be seen in advance. Florida will largely be under water in a few decades anyways. East coast also gets hurricane see NYC Sandy and its mostly low lying on the coasts so they are highly susceptible to rising sea levels. California has huge earthquake risk as its on the Pacific Rim of Fire. Also has a risk of tsunamis off the Pacific.  Also landslides drought bushfire. Seattle is at a high risk of earthquake and tsunami. Hell maybe even a volcano. To top it off Yellowstone has volcanoes that could potentially erupt and destroy the whole country although unlikely to happen in our lifetimes. ,melbourne,ck9bcth,6,t5_2qkhb

1884714,0,t1_ckgatkf,ampampamp Idaho stop sfw gtThe Idaho stop is the common name for a law that allows cyclists to treat a stop sign as a yield sign and a red light as a stop sign. It first became law in Idaho in  but has not been adopted elsewhere. citation needed A limited form of the law called Stop as Yield that deals only with stop signs has expanded to parts of Colorado and been considered in several other states. Advocates argue that current law criminalizes normal cycling behavior and that the Idaho stop makes cycling easier and safer and places the focus where it should be on yielding the rightofway.  Opponents think it is less safe because it violates the principles of vehicular cycling and makes cyclists less predictable.gtgtImage from article iInteresting Idaho | Sandpoint Amtrak station | Stop sign | List of Amtrak stations Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckgattm oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckgattm.

The City of Melbourne bans public drinking in the CBD but allows it everywhere else.  Port Phillip council bans it between the hours of pm and ammeaning that its bottomsup come pm.  Hobsons Bay Maribyrnong Moonee Valley Darebin and Glen Eira councils only ban public drinking in certain highuse zones such as the waterfront Footscray Market Mt Alexander Road Preston Market and Caulfield Racecourse.

They would need calibration and proof the machines were working  effectively without error before even taking this to court to convict you.Im guessing accountability and hardware certification wasnt in the original design spec for myki.In the example on that page it states that the evidence act is used to suggest that when the device is working effectively with established and measurable results that it cant be called into question i.e. the photocopier will make visibly identical copies when the toner and laser are working. But if it is malfunctioning it might not produce the expected outcome and the evidence then could be called into question visible streaks toner fading etc information could be missed.So in the instance of myki it can be reasonably demonstrated that the readers arent reliable especially with multiple users in quick succession.,melbourne,cla8ix4,3,t5_2qkhb

Groceries wise you can get by on  a week eating pretty well less if you buy stuff from fresh food markets rather than supermarkets grocery stores. Liquor laws here are far more relaxed than Minnesota and a lot of other US states but dont go looking for beer in the grocery store!Also its probably important to note that most apartments here are not rented out furnished.

I seem to be getting good feedback from them despite me not really generating much traffic for them if at all. In the end my goal was to document things I like to do in town with photos. I am not in it for sharing opinions but just highlight that events exist. Its up to the viewer to decide whether they like an event or not and Im not qualified to say something is good or bad. Hopefully in a years time I have enough content for people to come back to.

2725631,0,t3_2r9xsc,You raise an important issue. I think there needs to be a good discussion about this. I think there is a place for posting information about fires on reddit but it needs to be done in a careful manner rather than random threads that may not even be seen by many people as they dont get upvoted. I am one of the contributors to the live thread about the fires The sticky thread at the top of radelaide Adelaide northeastern fires  is another good example of reddit being used to help inform people about fires. I believe these are both good examples of how reddit can be used in fires and other disasters or emergencies. In general I urge people who post information about fires to follow a few simple guidelines.  Link back to the original source which should usually be the government agency in charge of managing the disaster.  Clearly include dates times and locations for any information. If the information is from a nonofficial but reliable source explain who it is.  Try to keep information in a single thread that can be upvoted near the top of the page rather than create multiple threads that dont get upvoted. I also suggest that the moderators could create sticky threads on days of total fire ban or when there are major fires or other disasters to ensure that there is reliable information that is easy to find. ,melbourne,cndw5o8,4,t5_2qkhb

2763571,0,t3_2rpzhk,I  moved from Coburg to Sunshine about  months ago. I really prefer Sunshine over Coburg in terms of accessibility by PT even though there isnt a tram service I think the train is much better than the Upfield and the buses are good too. The train services are very frequent they get busy but since there is a train every  minutes in the busiest part of the morningevening its not too bad unless there are cancellations. There are a lot of buses too the  go from around sunshine into the city via footscray plus there are buses to Highpoint. I think from Sunshine West there are a few buses to Sunshine Station to connect to the train.Re crime I felt much less safe in Coburg and saw heaps more crimedodgy stuff than in Sunshine. That said I was in a dodgy bit of Coburg compared to a pretty nice area of Sunshine.I think there is more to do around Sunshine than there was around Coburg. There is a cinema some nice parks okay sort of shops heaps of Vietnamese restaurants and some other cafes etc. I think there are a few kind of Indian restaurants off the main street and an Afghan place and a few African ones too. ,melbourne,cni7gzt,5,t5_2qkhb

Get your free feeds at various club meetings each day or at least find a cheap sausage sizzle every day at Clayton.Go to OWeek  helps you get out and meet a lot of people quickly. Otherwise find your faculty organisations and go to their partiesballsetc. Always great fun and a cheap night out in real terms. Our EOY Ball was  bucks for three course dinner and all you can drink at really nice venues. Awesome time.Avoid at all costs scheduling pm tutorials. Make sure youre the FIRST person getting onto Allocate or whatever theyve called it at Monash now so you can cherry pick the best schedule. I never minded the am lecture as much as I loathed the pm tutorial but figure out your best mode of study and work into that. EDIT  no longer need to worry about signing in quickly.Search around for cheapfree textbooks. Monash knows how to gouge at the bookstore so the only thing you should buy there is a Monash hoodie super comfortable or any other books you cant find elsewhere.Dont be afraid to schedule classes at other campuses. Berwick and Caulfield are accessible by the train line or the campus bus. If it suits you better then use it. Get a part time job to support yourself. The bills pile up fast at university. Better yet get a job at somewhere with night shift or a lot of flexible scheduling. I worked at a newsagency and landscaped and it was not ideal as the hours were pretty much only daytime  same as uni. Most of all dont be afraid to be on campus and enjoy it. Dont always feel the need to study or run off campus once youre done with a class. There are heaps of awesome peopleclubs around. Find the ones you love.

3489477,0,t3_30815r,I have exactly the same thing... I dont even own my backyard I own a one quarter interest in it. I also own a one quarter interest in everyone elses backyards too.  We ended up just buying a gio strata insurance policy to cover the common property and have public liability insurance. It was less than  per annum.  We paid for it ourselves. Once we become friendly with the other unit holders well try get them to share the cost.   Other things which may be of interest to you I paid a bucket load in lawyers fees before buying the property.  To set up a body corporate would require a new survey of the property new titles to be drawn up and everyones agreement. Everyone would need their own legal and tax advice. So it becomes quite an expensive proposition.   We unfortunately have an added problem that the agreement that is supposed to cover sharing maintenance costs has no legal standing so it really is up to everyones goodwill and good nature to pay for thing. Edit GIO definitely has the type of insurance policy youre looking for. Aami might have it. When we cancelled our aami policy the lady I spoke to said they were introducing one shortly. So call around the policy type is called strata policy so called because of the type of subdivision it is usually used for  however even if your title is a different type that is the type of policy,melbourne,cpq0xav,3,t5_2qkhb

Ausnet tends to be the most expensive area.Compare usage rates AND supply charge. Every energy retailer has a supply charge. This information should be freely available on their websites.Compare plans and discounts. Are the discounts off the ENTIRE bill or JUST the usage? Do you have to agree to a lockin contract? Are there late fees OR fees for NOT going on direct debit? Dont concern yourself with whether a company is Australian owned or not. The vast majority are not Australian owned. However every single company I know has their customer service call center located in Australia almost always in VictoriaMelbourne.I hope this helps. PM me if you have questions.

Lupicia in QV from the handful of teas Ive tried has really good quality stuff but its up the pricey end of the spectrum. Japaneseowned parent company I think and the teas reflect that. Theres The Tea Centre in Emporium. Friend swears by them though Ive never tried anything. Oriental Teahouse also has some teas on offer. They do a reasonable job of Chinese teas but Ive never been particularly impressed. Also  for Storm in a Teacup I mostly go for its tea bar rather than retail sales though. If you want you can also try David Jones tea selection.

Therefore they can make up as much time as the skipping of the station will do a minute or two by reducing that time.Second its almost certain that someone will have wanted to get off at that station  so youve now forced them to get off at the next station and then take a train BACK to the station they were supposed to stop at.In short it should be banned or be viewed as a cancelled train.,melbourne,cr318tg,28,t5_2qkhb

The podiatrist should be able to fairly easily tell whether or not you need orthotics vs physio for your back pain. At least mine was able to when I had knee pain. I only had one appointment with the podiatrist to check if my old pair of orthotics were still OK. You can get a range of premade orthotics not just from the podiatrist.

Whereto whom you were born is a life lottery simple fact.But private schools arent exactly inaccessible to everyone. The rich area schools are actually for public schools. Its not like its impossible to escape the life of mediocrity cycle. And even then thats a subjective opinion of what mediocrity is.And its reasonably accessible to get into public schools that have admission based on grades.And all that becomes irrelevant with gov lending money for tertiary education schemes and the multitudes of ways to actually get in including those that dont involve VCE scores.The thing is most parents seem not to care and just shove them into whatever school is convenient. And at the same time most of those students dont care because well lots of reasons. But one big one is because they grew up surrounded by other studentsadults who also arent into education as much as someone from a private school.You gather enough of students who actually care about learning more than where theyre going to party next or whos kissing whom and the attitude rubs off on other students. Ive been to both and the mindsets of the majority of students that differ from schools is astounding. ,melbourne,cs3ma45,1,t5_2qkhb

However quite excited to see the double decker bus on display at the open day which will be used to ply the route between Wyndham Vale and Werribee stations.If successful they will build more for use in Melbourne. These are the same ones that are being exported to Singapore and other countries.

Not justifying drink driving here but even though I live in an inner city suburb having a car is multitudes of order more convenient due to how spread out Melbourne is. What takes me  mins in the car would take an hour on PT door to door  and with far less walking waiting outside you can leave on your own terms and be able to do unplanned things.In London and places like Manhattan theres more dense coverage of public transport more types you have long distance trains underground rapid transit buses and direct transport lines like to Heathrow in an orbitalspider web layout several shoppingemployment centres and more frequent PT  like every  or  minutes. Melbourne is too centralised in the CBD so theres a huge bottleneck and PT is focused on getting to and from the CBD at peak times.

I will absolutely grant you the following Winners are the patrons of other routes that get to keep using Swanston St hospital precinct gets lowfloor trams etc. Losers are the patrons of current Route  who will have their existing service cease and replaced with a less convenient substitute.Having winners and losers across the an area is a fact of life. Ill grant you that you can point to the winners. Ive never disputed that for a second. It seems though youre not prepared to concede any ground in your opinion that patrons of Route  suffer no disadvantage objectively not true.This is a state government both past and present taking rivers of gold out of the area from the property development explosion and contributing absolutely nothing back except to degrade a popular tram service.Where is the give and take in South Yarra? A train station so full of people in mornings its a wonder nobodys fallen onto the tracks and died yet? Trams so full you can barely get onto them? Suburb serviced by old rattlers that are unpunctual small and unusable to the aged and mobility impaired? Infrastructure and road network no longer groaning but now starting to collapse under the weight of population growth? I see no meaningful proposal from any party to address this All compromise no contribution.As Ive said from the getgo this post  the Libs stupid website  is about a particular area South Yarra  Stonnington being hard done by on a PTV operational change.

Good luck finding any objective scrutiny of labour practices in Singapore. I dont think you know that country anywhere near as well as you think you do.gtIm not talking about Black amp Whites or similar historically significant buildingsMe either. Lots of buildings erected in the s in Malaya  Singapore were beautifully designed. HDBs werent the only thing that went up in that era  theres not much of that stuff left though. Plenty in Malaysia if you know where to look.gt As for energy usage in new buildings this is less relevant than how energy is producedYes but in the meantime its very significant given the countrys dependence on air conditioning.gt This will probably happen anyway.The govt isnt going to let a little popular dissent get in the way of something like its population tsrgets.,melbourne,cuuwaem,2,t5_2qkhb

5055142,0,t3_3k73r7,. If money isnt an issue get a Mac but you can save a decent amount by getting a purposebuilt PC and it will perform just as good.. Dont bother with sound card. Youll be using an interface see point . Depends on what sort of quality you are after. I do a lot of music stuff so I wouldnt be able to help in this dept.. XLR to XLR times however many mics you are needing  should do it. Headphones. Again depends on the quality you are after. I use KRK KNSs and they are awesome but you may not need to spend that much if you are only dealing with speech. Monitors see point . Studio reference monitors can be expensive and are designed for frequency response when dealing with music. Id be looking at spending  PLUS for a good set of studio monitors for music. Dont know if itd be worth it for speech though.. DONT bother with pro tools. Its too expensive and has way too much stuff youll never use. Try reaper free trial and see what you think. Interface again it depends. Most USB interfaces will be fine for what you want. Focusrite scarletts are great and affordable. Probably best to go to a music store like Allans or Cranbourne music in the CBD and have a chat to the dudes in the studiohitech departments there for hardware. Software can be bought online cheaply. ,melbourne,cuvc3zm,1,t5_2qkhb

Talk more about how long theyve been looking for work farming again and try find a way to make them think they need to upskill themselves offer an option with the course and careers coaches on our end to help them... I was horrible at it I just needed a job at the time and fell into it. I didnt last long at all I didnt believe in it despite what they were trying to make everyone believe.

ACU and La Trobe are probably ranked second. Monash has a shocking name amongst working nursesmanagers. Having said that you will only get out of it what you put into it. Be prepared to travel for your clinicals as Victoria is always short of clinical placements. I would advise against the current trend of going straight into a Masters Of Nursing. The masters degrees on offer for novice nursing students currently do not have a good name. From first hand experience mentoringsupervising these nurses fresh from Uni they underperform when compared to straight bachelor students. If you want a masters do your degree first and then get some experience. You will get a lot more out of your masters as a mature working nurse. If you have a vague idea of what sort of nursing you want to do and its ok if you dont thats what clinical placement and grad years are for then try to pick electives that match with your interest especially if the university offers clinical placement in your elective subject.

5351718,0,t1_cvvq5mx,Many of the Republican efforts have been good ensuring government doesnt have a proabortion outlook by funding it or engaging in propaganda trying to change individual opinions which is just as bad as government being against abortion in my opinion. This isnt really part of the abortion debate but rather trying to ensure government doesnt interfere with individuals. And many of the efforts in the USA are similar to what has been discussed in Victoria. Just because there hasnt been a parliamentary majority in Victoria to follow through with the legislation changing the law aboriton was only legalised a few parliaments ago doesnt mean the debate is over the Christian lobby in Victoria may not be as strong as it is in Texas but there are still a lot of Christians here. Abortion could prove good fodder for a politician needing votes in the future.

If your carriage is stopped in the loop and someone in your carriage starts having a heart attack you can now call for an ambulance and get real time first aid advice without having to go through the convoluted process of pressing the emergency intercom waiting for a Metro staff member to respond having them call  with the limited info youve given them and either not have any first aid advice or be given first aid advice second hand through the intercom. This could literally save someones life.

I worked as a lab tech for  months they didnt renew my contract I was unemployed for  months before I got a unrelated admin job... Theres not much work out there due a lot of automation the machines also use their own buffers and no glassware is needed... If you look at seek there are technician jobs listed saying you need a degree... This isnt allowed as that makes you a scientist  Privately owned companies also pay awful..  I went to an interview where they offered   pa  With recent Chem graduates being offered  My last lab job offered me   pa and that was considered good.. There was a fuckton of responsibility lots of unpaid overtime and I was expected to do the same stuff as the scientists and get paid a lot less as well as doing the shitty jobs and being treated pretty awful.. I recently got an admin job and Im on   .. Its easy AF.

5995062,0,t1_cy5h1nr,gt Can you please tell me of a single legally operating dairy in north america that sells raw milk cheese curds? How does it pass the day aged raw milk based cheese law?No because I studied pasteurisation here in Australia and was just told that there were places that sold it legally in some areas of Canada. When I was traveling in the U.S. I ate some myself but I didnt ask which dairy produced it.If you reread my comment and my others in your thread with the user who is a cheesemonger youll see that Im actually agreeing with you regarding the use of pasteurised cheese curd for poutine. So take off your angry hat for a sec.Also I never stated there was a traditional raw milk curd for poutine. I said that traditionally cheese curds were made with raw milk  a completely unrelated fact to the existence of poutine.My comment  if you read it again carefully  simply states that Canadian poutine is made using pasteurised cheese curds  which is something you agree with yes? Pasteurised cheese curds can be legally imported to Australia. Therefore if someone wants to replicate the experience of eating poutine in Australia they can because they are legally able to obtain pasteurised cheese curd because it is not raw.,melbourne,cy5hero,1,t5_2qkhb

Im not certain I would. My experience through  years of a law degree at a pretty good university is the ATAR a student got is completely irrelevant to their actual intelligence and problem solving skills.

If you already didnt vote Labor and now you dont like what theyre doing how exactly did they trick you? Were you going to vote for them even less?Every night theyre on the news with residents of Carnegie Murrumbeena and Hughesdale who look like they probably wouldnt vote against the Liberal Party even if they were promising to torture children and Im left trying to figure out how their opinion about the Labor government is particularly relevant. Itd be one thing if they were saying I told you that voting Labor was a bad idea but its another thing entirely to act as though youve been deceived when you already had your say about the Labor party and were outvoted. They dont go to Clayton or Noble Park and ask those residents how they feel because they actually voted for the Labor party like the idea of eliminating horrendous level crossing in their neighbourhoods and dont have an axe to grind with the government. ,melbourne,d0llgih,16,t5_2qkhb

In Sydney at least in the east traffic is inherently more chaotic because of the landscape and planning more curves hills oneway systems etc. whereas here everything is flat and in straight lines. Somehow the unchallenging driving conditions in Melbourne lowers peoples awareness or dulls their senses and they drive like zombies. But coupled with that theres some terrible nastiness that has crept into the tone of peoples attitudes while driving.In Sydney everyone just gets along better on the roads. Compared to Melbourne its a bit like the cities where chaos reigns SE Asia Rome whatever but everyone knows to just get along.

It simply takes too long to get the info you want quickly which can mean a lot if the tram you want is  seconds away. Put it this way given an option between the app and the audio announcements they both fare rather terribly in terms of efficiency of information delivery and Id probably just head for the audio announcement button and leave my phone in my pocket.   Just for clarification I also cant easily see the tram route number on the tram itself especially in the case of the Dclass and up until recently the BClass also the C I think?Ill let you work out what they have in common. As such I often rely on the scheduling information being present and accurate in order to work out if Im getting on the right tram.

Im really not grasping that concept so youre going to have to spell it out for me.    Youre clearly wrong here. Uber has filled a void that the low number of taxis created and their customer base continues to grow. The high rate of surge prices PROVES that there is not enough drivers to meet the demand of customers. If there was these surges wouldnt occur so often and wouldnt get so high.  Uber drivers can even accept fares while they still have a passenger in their vehicle. Again showing the need to have drivers around ready to take passengers at their demand.  Uber didnt TAKE the taxis customers the taxis LOST them and Uber created their own demand for their service.,melbourne,d26b5hq,2,t5_2qkhb
7285759,0,t1_d267uf3,gt I didnt know they had the choice to reject short tripsThey dont. Its illegal to refuse a fare on the basis that its too short. However cabbies do it all the time. ,melbourne,d26cbla,7,t5_2qkhb
7286619,0,t3_4f5xv2,Ive never had issues with the taxi drivers themselves. Sure sometimes they dont really know where theyre going and sometimes theyre crappy drivers. But Ive also had crappy drivers with Uber.The main difference is just the user experience. I book an Uber from my phone via an app. I know where it is and when itll get here. I know its not going to be a total crapshoot as to when it comes and whether it even comes at all. I dont have to worry about getting out my wallet to pay it just happens automatically. And I can split fares via the app as well.Uber is just a better product. Period. Please correct me if Im wrong but there is literally no reason to prefer a taxi other than surge pricing but its not super common and its avoidable most of the time. Any arguments about regulations and licensing and testing are demonstrably bullshit. They dont actually improve the service of the taxi they just give a perception that theyre somehow safer or better.,melbourne,d26fu5n,10,t5_2qkhb

7291768,0,t1_d263v70,A slightly tangential take on it  in Germany we lived in a pretty nice area.  My girlfriend orders a lot of stuff.  Our delivery guys were phenomenal even thought friends from elsewhere bitched about theirs.I found out that apparently a lot of very wealthy people lived in or near our neighborhood and that a lot of these guys were on corporate boards or clubs with each other.  And the last thing the various delivery companies want is to have rich powerful people bitching and moaning to each other how shit their delivery service is so theyd regularly detail their best guys.  Yay us.Regarding the efficiency I think youre looking at it wrong  a drone is a oneoff investment plus occasional maintenance.  Once its running you have huge economies of scale.  With a van you have to pay the driver plus you have the same sorts of running costs even more  fuel vs. electricity.  For the price of a single van you can probably also buy  UAVs for example a really buff HiSystemsARF BigOkto will run for about .k Euro  lt k AUD reckon maybe k with all the support infrastructure.  UAVs can go as the crow flies rather than having to take a circuitous route or be subject to traffic.  They can just go back and forth and back and forth all day long.  You wouldnt even have to have them sit and charge just swap out the batteries after every trip and have a few spare sets charging.  So in short you have a high startup cost but absolutely minimal running cost high reliability and consistency speed flexibility and a whole lot of other things going for it.Now ensuring that your super buff packetdelivering mega drone doesnt accidentally shred the neighbors chihuahua when it comes running out to chase it...thats another story.  And one that just gave me some pretty funny mental imagery.,melbourne,d270wo6,1,t5_2qkhb

He was quiet but quite popular I suppose his actions spoke louder than his words.I havent seen him for . years so I dont know if he became a different person or stayed the same but from my experience with him he seemed like a great man and absolutely not someone who deserved this fate.

My experience in driving in America was a lot less confronting. Of course I expected the left hand drive cars because its common knowledge. Hardly unexpected if you dont live under a rock.

7689668,1,t1_d3g90zi,Yes it is absolutely forcing the issue and it should be forced.However if they had a females only job ad that attracted no applicants then theres no imbalance its just because females dont want the job.I bet they will be snowed under with applicants.With your midwifery example I can see what you are saying and while you are correct that there will be more females than males applying you will also see that there are also significantly less males who want to pursue it as a career. With that specific career its about patient comfort as well though an expecting mother might not be comfortable going through all the indignities of pregnancy with a male who can have at best only a theoretical understanding of everything whereas a female may have been through the same thing.You also need to consider that historically men have been preferred for most jobs out there. Whether it be for labouring jobs because they are typically stronger or for white collar jobs because typically those are the ones with power. Ideally everyone should be considered equally for every role purely on their merits but that just doesnt happen. We are probably getting closer to that idea but we are a long way from it. Even where gender balance exists the pay gap still exists.Everything you have said is reasonable but it doesnt take into account the systemic bias that exists. Historically women should be home makers and look after the children men are the breadwinners. Obviously thats not quite how it is now but that societal model is recent enough that the unconcious and sometimes very concious bias still exists. So we need artificial constructs to address it until we get to the point where people are genuinely hired on their merits. We are moving towards that point but we have a long way to go.,melbourne,d3g9l60,0,t5_2qkhb

Its just part of being on Casual rates really.

Theres ways and means to get on the ladder and getting on the ladder and playing the game is the way to get forward. If someone doesnt throw these ideas into the hat it becomes a giant circle jerk about how its fucked and the system is fucked and how miserable everyone is.Another anecdote based on my own experience is if people cant buy a house in Fitzroy theyre more interested in complaining about the system rather than playing the system to gain advantage. Affordability in this city is fucked. That said its growing rapidly and we have shit legislation restricting minimum sizes and greenfields as great ideas. Its a simple case of supply vs demand supply is further being restricted whilst demand continues to grow and government are scratching their fucking heads trying to find ways to convince people that they cant see it and that they care about it. ,melbourne,d4clevx,2,t5_2qkhb

Police tells us we should place car keys for example in an obvious place in the house to avoid being attacked by burglars. There have been cases where people were tortured and sometimes even killed for something like a simple Volkswagen. Dont make contact and just call the cops is the advice often given. I understand where the advice is coming from as being injured or killed is much worse than having your stuff stolen but I hate that were supposed to just give in to these criminals. There is little you can do though if these criminals get killed while on the job theyll just be replaced by people that use more force the next time.My bike and car are outfitted with hidden physical switches that kill ignition by the way.

Their tracks are designed to operate at kmh and have run test trains well over kmh. They did have accidents and had to adjust the operational speed down to kmh. The tracks can handle the higher speeds but the problem was the amount of maintennance needed for the higher speeds was too high not the tracks themselves. Ifwhen maintennance processes are improved then close to kmh would be pretty normal for a modern high speed rail network. Certainly twenty years from now.,melbourne,d5bob46,20,t5_2qkhb

8284196,0,t1_d5cngqw,gt As stupid as it sounds I didnt think it was remotely possible until we sat down and did the sums.A work colleague and I were chatting about this once people really misunderstand the phrase live within your means. Because everyone does you live according to what you can afford. But when your disposable income increases you opt for more and more items  a nicer car a better apartment a gym membership regular indulgence items like beauty therapy etc. When youre broke you only get the absolute bare minimum because thats all you can afford. So everyone feels like they have no spare cash because theyre using it all  at whatever margin they can. Like you say when you sit down and do the maths you can identify things that you are currently spending money on that you can do without and cut back to make savings.  But this idea of live within your means is actually arse about face. When people say it meaning live frugally so that you can afford the bigger items you want like a house they ignore that what everyone actually does is go I have money I can afford the thing that I want I am getting the thing that I want. Our levels of consumption rise with our ability to pay for consumption. We were working at legal aid at the time and the conversation came out of our frustration of having people approach the duty lawyer service wanting free legal help when their weekly income was higher than our own! Back then there wasnt a means test on the duty lawyer service although we did have a discretion to refuse legal assistance to people who could obviously pay for a private lawyer. Now there is a means test and its enforced. ,melbourne,d5d30rp,1,t5_2qkhb

8422812,0,t3_4uyn0z,My personal list? Upgrade the train management system  Ive read that some parts are  years old to make the trains more efficient and on time. Make the CBD car free except for for a few key roads upgrade those roads to increase flow and decrease chokepoints Create our own Fiber Optic Network Theres no point waiting for Telstra or any of the other ISPs with their thumbs up own ass.  Theres been some very good successes in North America and some great case studies coming out of them.  I suggest that Melbourne does the same.  Australia is in the stone age in terms of internet speeds and at the same time Melbourne is having a fairly decent tech boom since its such a livable city.  Theres several times at work where my internet has gone to a crawl or stopped working altogether  massive Telstra outage in the past few months.  This is unacceptable for tech businesses and I personally think that Melbourne deserves better.  We can do better.  Start small and only connect the CBD businesses and people that live there highest density of subscribers and expand from there.  Within  years you can get most of Melbourne connected with Fiber to the home and never have to upgrade the cables ever again since light is the fastest thing in the universe the only thing to upgrade would the be laser emitters and receivers.I would praise anyone that makes this a reality a god among mere mortals.,melbourne,d5ue68n,1,t5_2qkhb

8633305,0,t3_4y2rst,Some observations from someone who drove a lot in  . It isnt as bad as it seems. Yes there are a lot of morons on the road but  of drivers are fine. Its just that when you see  cars on a trip thats  unsafe drivers.. Most car speedometers overreport your speed by about . Think youre going ? Youre probably really doing . Get a GPS reading of your speed over a few km and itll likely be more accurate. You will soon learn to compensate for your cars speedometer. Dont overcompensate though.. You are responsible for obeying the law. Any excuse like everyone else was doing it or I was driving to the conditions or my favourite I have faster than average reactions and can stop safely are not going to fly. You will be booked and you will deserve it.. There are lots of new speed limit changes. So many drivers arent aware of them. They may not know theyre speeding. Dont be one of them. See a strip of shops and tram tracks? Youre very likely in a  zone. In fact most shopping strips around Melbourne are now  zones. Also most not all of the  zones are gone. . A cop wont pull you over if you are doing less than km over the limit. But a camera will ping you for doing km over the limit. Assume that every built up intersection has a speed camera and always make sure you are doing the limit through traffic lights.. Taxi drivers are like every other car  except that only about  of them are fine. Itll seem the inverse is true though because the unsafe ones are supermega crazy.. If you drive a lot consider getting a dashcam a phone mount and an app that tells you the speed limit. I use Speed Cameras by Sygic. But even then you cant rely on it  due to all the changes in the past couple of years. It will help if you regularly find yourself in unfamiliar roads.  all up but the first time it saves you from a speeding fine it has paid for itself. Very worth it.TLDR Dont speed.,melbourne,d6krqnn,0,t5_2qkhb

8989456,0,t1_d7se7fr,The de facto alliance that has developed between the Left and militant Islam the most reactionary force in the world today is the strangest and most disconcerting political development in my lifetime. If identity politics is the substantive part of this mutant ideology the compliance and enforcement arm is the system of thought control we nowadays term political correctness.According to the PC mindset someone who openly or even privately challenges core tenets of identity politics is not just wrong but morally depraved. Such a person is not to be engaged with argumentatively but must be vilified censored and where possible pursued legally using instruments such as the iniquitous section C of our Racial Discrimination Act and equivalents in other countries.Given their head progressive politicians will introduce even more restrictive laws. Former British Labour leader Ed Miliband pledged before the last British election to make Islamophobia which he never bothered to define an aggravated criminal offence.Regressive Left activists often claim to be fighting against fascism or the extreme Right. Ironically they are the ones who time and again resort to classic s fascist tactics such as wrecking the meetings of their opponents and in some cases harassing or attacking attendees.I experienced this last year while attending a meeting at the University of Sydney that was being addressed by a speaker known to be defensive of Israel a position now verboten on campuses around the world.The meeting was disrupted by a chanting mob led by a young woman with a megaphone the leaders making clear afterwards that they were there not to challenge or debate but to silence.Some local academics actually defended this behaviour on the ground there was no inherent right to free speech if it contravened the progressive world view. There are even calls at Ivy League colleges in the US for the right to free speech to be supplanted by the insistence on socially just speech. Incredibly the young woman leading the protest shouted her outrage that a speaker from the virulently antiSemitic Hizb utTahrir organisation had previously been blocked from speaking at the university.This sort of coddling of extreme antiSemitism thinly masked as antiZionism is one of the most revolting aspects of the regressive Left. American professor of queer theory Judith Butler described as a postmodern colossus and a leading figure in the global boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel has insisted that Hamas and Hezbollah be seen as part of the global progressive Left. Both these groups have expressed the aspiration to exterminate all Jews in Hamass case it is in its founding charter. Butler received some criticism over this but her stellar standing in the progressive academic pantheon was undiminished.And it is not just academics. British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke warmly of his friends in Hamas and Hezbollah.So it is pretty clear what the regressive Left is against. But what is it for exactly? Its members would answer that they are fighting for social justice. Actually it would be more accurate to say they are for social justice activism. Earlier incarnations of leftist ideology all had some conception of the good society they were working for even if sometimes a terribly flawed one as with the communists.Go to the websites of radical Left groups bearing names such as Socialist Alternative and you will see that there is no alternative. They do not even attempt to posit one. They are essentially nihilists who stand for nothing. Activism is a goal in itself not some desired societal end state.The supreme recent exemplar of social justice activism is the Black Lives Matter movement in the US. This movement is spawning imitators around the world including Australia according to a recent ABC report.Academic practitioners of the field known as critical race theory sprang into action to lend theoretical support. The tenor of some of this stuff would have stunned our Rip Van Winkle. There is an article on the website of the Harvard Law faculty that calls for racebased mobilisations language that would not have been out of place in s Germany.For the social justice activists two kinds of questions are strictly off limits. First narratives of victimhood must not be challenged no matter how compelling the contrary evidence.Hence the shooting of a young black man in Ferguson Missouri was a straightout case of murder the victim shot with his hands raised. This version of events has been completely debunked since. But no matter the critical race brigade sticks to this narrative in its scholarly articles including one by a prominent academic at the Western Sydney University that referred to Ferguson matteroffactly as a racist murder well after the facts were established.This is not mere sloppiness. Reading this stuff you quickly realise that for this kind of scholarship facts evidence and the truth are strictly irrelevant.Which brings me to the second type of unaskable question. Does the activism actually do any good? Has Black Lives Matter actually improved the lives of people trapped in impoverished innercity ghettos? All the evidence indicates the contrary. Homicide rates in innerurban areas have risen sharply since BLM started reversing a decadeslong declining trend. FBI director James Comey has linked this to the abandoning of proactive policing by cops fearful of vilification and prosecution.Have the prospects for Palestinians to lead a decent life been enhanced by the international BDS campaign that urges them to stick to their rejectionist guns thereby precluding a settlement with Israel and condemning future generations to repeated conflict?Have young girls in Muslim communities benefited from the sentiments expressed by feminists such as Germaine Greer who condemned efforts to outlaw female genital mutilation as an attack on cultural identity?In Britain hospitals are reporting an average  cases of this each day yet there have been no successful prosecutions despite the practice being illegal since . Where are the feminists on this and on forced marriages? Nowhere it seems with a handful of honourable exceptions. It seems that for the regressive Left there is a hierarchy of correctness in which cultural respect is trumps.The kind of moral catastrophe this can induce is shockingly displayed by events in the northern English town of Rotherham. Across  years  girls most from dysfunctional white families were subjected to sexual abuse of organised gangs of sexual predators of Pakistani Muslim background. As two subsequent official reports disclosed all arms of government that should have protected the girls  the police social services schools the Labourcontrolled local council  were paralysed by a dread of being labelled racist or Islamophobic.I think of regressive leftism as a mind virus a paralytic disease that is severely inhibiting the ability of Western societies to properly debate some of the most important issues they face. It is suffused with civilisational selfloathing  severely condemnatory of white postEnlightenment Western societies yet prepared to overlook or apologise for the most egregious defects in other kinds of society.To see what can result from this paralysis look at Europe as it grapples with the consequences of its leaders decision to effectively dissolve its external borders with North Africa and the Middle East.Consider the enormity of the transformation Europe is undergoing and imagine how it will look in several decades if this continues. Yet Europes elites seem incapable of conducting an honest debate about the implications of this since this would involve asking some tough questions about whether Islam with its undoubted violent and supremacist aspects is ultimately compatible with liberal societies. Some of Europes leaders actually seem to have become reconciled to the prospect of large parts of Europe becoming Islamised. After all what could be worse than the existing civilisation that is nothing but a sorry litany of racism colonialism and oppression? And the biggest losers from this will be the selfstyled progressives. What prospect for gay rights under the new dispensation?This fecklessness and intellectual paralysis would be far less serious if it were confined to the Left proper but it is not as exemplified by Angela Merkels extraordinarily naive actions in the past year. The impulse to censor and anathematise anyone who challenges the prevailing zeitgeist can be found in parties regarded as centrist or even rightwing. This has created space for the emergence of new political forces throughout the Western world including Australia with a surge in support for Pauline Hanson at the recent elections.I believe the time has come for a fundamental rethinking of the lines of political division. At this historical juncture decent leftists must drop the masochistic obsession with denigrating postEnlightenment Western civilisation and join with liberals conservatives and others in a concerted effort to defend it against the unprecedented threats it now faces.Peter Baldwin was a minister in the Hawke and Keating Labor governments.,melbourne,d7se7j6,12,t5_2qkhb

The lines they connect do not interact and the point of it is to provide city capacity to lines that do not recieve any benefits or additional capacity from the first Metro tunnel. Not saying that it means the new tunnel should start right away but the staging of each has zero consequence for the other and it is important precisely because the Metro tunnel  does provide any additional capacity for the north east lines. I feel like waiting for the Metro tunnel to complete is used as an excuse for holding off on other projects and improvements where the project doesnt actually have any interaction with. ,melbourne,d7vlwrz,3,t5_2qkhb

Im not understanding your point. If it were that simple the government should just make all trains and taxis free for everyone all of the time right?gt Also other people use the Night Trains.

9161927,0,t3_55slfo,I feel as if people in general dont know how the criminal justice system works as a whole and individually  police courts and corrections.As someone who studies criminology reading comments on reddit and other social media just astounds me how people think everything is so black and white. Not everything can be fixed easily with one solution that dont have potential negative outcomes or backlash.Judges use existing sentencing practises and precedents for offences to base their sentencing. This includes aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the offender the prior history of the offender does not get mentioned in a court case because they are being charged for that offence committed at that time only not what they did  years ago.Judges and magistrates are bound by set legislation. There are judge made laws yes but most laws come from Parliament.I wouldnt say that judges get it wrong per se but some sentences arent really in proportion to the offence personal opinion of course . Sending people to jail will only lead to further stigmatisation and a reoffending.Bail in regards to my previous statement judges can grant bail.. but everyone seems to think its only them. So when the media get wind that an offender was on bail when they reoffended everyones up in arms in the comments.Police officers can grant bail. Bail justices literally just every day people in the community can grant someone bail.Even victims of crime in the criminal justice system and thats a whole other thing that I cannot be assed typing on my phone.People just need to be more educated before speaking on an integral functioning part of society and how they think it works.Theres so much I could talk about.Overall its not the worse but there are definitely some improvements that could be made.Someone feel free to correct me on any of this if Im wrong Im in potato mode and some of these statements are VERY broad and general and I could go into detail but...,melbourne,d8dcate,3,t5_2qkhb

You need to be aware that while your issues are valid and should be addressed they need to be addressed separately because derailing this issue pretty much means that nothing gets done about any of it.I like to think of it this way. If we reduce domestic violence by making society think that DV is wrong and bad and that people start to feel shame for indulging in that behaviour I personally think that that will spill over into the other areas and while they may not resolve the other areas as well a lot of the ground work will have been done to make them easier to tackle because the larger issue has had progress made on it.Thats my thinking.,melbourne,d8rghsv,1,t5_2qkhb

Perhaps similar to the rental deductibility rules  available for rent not excessively picky on potential tenants and advertised to the community at large. . If a property is vacant there should be an incentive to lease the property to the local council for commission housing under the council responsibility to maintain the property  e.g. Vacancy tax waived for the proportion of time leased to the council  this would be especially beneficial to houses which are being planned on redevelopedknocked down. . In terms of tax vacant properties should be ineligible for capital gains discount for the time they were vacant. This should include holiday houses. These are generally unused for  months a year. They would likely have a much lower rateable value that city homes and as such the vacancy tax would be much lower say  rateable value could be k on m property but k on a k holiday home,melbourne,d9wa1vc,1,t5_2qkhb

I told the guy I was currently studying at university and wasnt really looking to study anywhere else. But despite that the bloke kept on begging me to sign up for the special information which I said no to a million times but he persisted. Idiots. Since then Ive learnt to never respond and just be an asshole for a moment. hahaOh there was another time I wanted to check prices at Goodlife Gym probs shouldnt name which one because I wanted to join a better gym. The sales rep lady came out and basically forced me to have a look around the gym including the saunas with her passive aggressive motherlike intimidating attitude. She then asking me irrelevant questions to what I inquired about to suck me into getting membership. Then she was telling me to give my bankdetails and I played dumb by handing over my nonvisa debit card to the point where she said to call her at a certain time the next day to discuss further.

10120810,0,t1_dbqq71d,gt I think the lighting in the CBD is quite pretty especially in conjunction with the clash between the modern and classic architecture and the smattering of green from the various parks or even just the number of trees around in general.So just a random pink light fixed on a tree and a random green one? With a few skylights in the same colour then the rest of the CBD dark? woah amazing.gt While you may see a smelly brown river I see fertile land that was fought over and lived in for millennia full of history.LOL what did i say about people in this city being ultra pretentious? Only a melbourne wanker would give that description of foul river that for the last century was used as both a toxic dumping ground for all the industry built around the river at one stage AND a place where criminals used to dump bodies.gt Its also chock full of interesting architecture to the point of I think one having to go out of their way or be blind not to see any beauty in it.Umm most of the interesting stuff was demolished years ago. Whats left is no different than what you see anywhere around a modern city. The interesting stuff has now dated and most of the new structures are generic grollo inspired shit or some hideous apartment tower. Yeah theres a few interesting buildings but SA is actually now building a lot more interesting stuff than Melbourne.gt Each to their own of course though Im probably biased having grown up here of course but I havent found the same beauty in most other places Ive been to.So was I. I have also been to many cities OS and i cringe hard when melbourne hipsters circklejerk over the city. Its generic its small its nothing but a massive consumer hub and over priced eateries. Its contrived tbh. Used to be interesting with all the laneways before they became what they are now. Also its nothng more than a city catered for chindian students these days. I dont know whats worst backpacker culture which infects many cities or the surge of the international chindian students.,melbourne,dbqqyvq,-7,t5_2qkhb

Most people that own multiple houses have leveraged against their other property. Everything is debt. Now its not a huge problem as long as interest rates go up and I doubt they will. Australia cant afford interest rates to go up.  But if they do or unemployment goes up massively. Then lots of houses will have to go down. People wont be able to borrow and pay back the loans needed so people cant offer then k someone wants. So they might need to sell at a slight loss. It happened in the s. Honestly though.  Its not gonna go down anytime soon. Then what will probably happen is a massive house of cards that falls.  ,melbourne,dbzbdp9,1,t5_2qkhb

And then have a list of high risk items that may not be fixtures phonestablets expensive watches engagement rings. And then round up unless you want to be calling your cover provider whenever you buy something new. Also take into account whether your policy is market value or replacement. If its market value adjust the value more expensive items down by  p.a. depending on what it is more for electronic items which tend to be quickly superseded.If your place burns down better to have more cover than less. And do yourself a favour get some cloud storage  setup gmail with tags and send photos of receipts to yourself for any items over  in value. That way its easy for you to prove ownership and value of items and any claim will go much more smoothly.   ,melbourne,dcfueiu,4,t5_2qkhb

Assumptions that lawyers and a judgejury need to squeeze to find the truth.Your point is irrelevant. gtPull over a bus being driven by a boy with  girls inside it. The girls have stolen goods on them from some shops. The boy has stolen goods from the bus and from the shops. They have no evidence that the girls aided amp abetted the theft of the bus yet and thus dont charge them for it while they saw the boy driving the bus and caught him with goods from the bus hence they charge him for it.Again. The fact that there are on the bus is enough to charge them for aidingabetting. You dont need to prove it when youre charging them. gtThen they seek witnesses before trying to pin more charges on the assailants.Im not sure if youre aware... But charges can easily be dropped or pleaded down.gtDoes this sound less reasonable to you than MISANDRY!? If so you might be a bit of a wanker.Now youre just being obtuse.gtSo hard to imagine a scenario where they didnt explicitly encourage it or aid in it right? Especially considering they were  years younger than him.If you actually bothered to read the actual law... You can easily see how they can be presumed to be complicit in the crime. At least enough to be charged for it.gtSorry theres nothing concrete anywhere in your argument.The law is pretty concrete. Im not saying theyre guilty. Im saying that they should have at least been charged. gtYou dont know the circumstances beyond whats in the article which clearly indicate a common sense scenario.Thats what the court is for. Thats not for the cops to decide. gtYoure having to jump through hoops trying to conjure a scenario based off nothing but assumptions where your double standard BS would actually apply.Again... Quoting the actual law is bullshit to you. Its amazing the mental gymnastics youre practicing here.gtYoure just another irrational Mens Rights Activist.Typical. You cant argue the facts so you resort to baseless insults and distraction. Well done.Clearly youre just too biased to actually present something of value here.

Perhaps you could ask your GP to find you a wellsuited psychologist and they can refer you to them instead of headspace. You can also give any GP the name of a psychologist you want to see and be referred to them with the remainder of your  sessions.You can also go back to any GP and say that your free  sessions as part of your mental healthcare plan are nearly up but you still are struggling with health issues and they can grant you more. I think up to  more free sessions.Failing any of that Swinburne and Melbourne University have graduate psychologists that see people for lowcost psychology. They will definitely do CBT. When I went it only cost me  for a session. Its worth looking into if you can afford  every fortnight.

Anything aimed at internationals that secure things ahead of time will probably rip you off.Just get your visa book into a hostel and come! Once you get here people can help you get settled into somewhere to live.Its hard to direct you to jobs and renting so far in advance. Most of the jobs you will be qualified to do dont hire in advance unseen unless they are scams. If you dont have a lot of money you will be share housing and you also need to be here to set that up.Dont stress too much if you arrive with good savings you can have an unskilled job and flat share within two weeks. There are heaps of unskilled jobs and flat shares going around.People on Reddit can answer your qs as you get settled and the questions arise as you tackle finding somewhere to live and work. I have moved and travelled before and I also wanted that everything set up ahead but found it just doesnt really work that way unless you go with some traveller aimed package deal rort. As for crazy Frenchies....lol! I dont have any Frenchies at the moment in my life theyve gone home but Ive had heaps and theyre great. I actually really love the occasional rudeness! Its funny. The only thing you have a bad reputation for and this is outside the city is theft from business owners. Frenchies just love to take stuff home from work apparently!Just grab a working holiday visa have some savings and you will be fine to come here and work and find yourself. ,melbourne,defvgpz,1,t5_2qkhb

If he contests the next election I dont see him drawing much personal support away from the Labor primary vote especially in such a safe seat  or at least he wouldnt draw enough of the vote to displace Labor from the top  parties not to mention any votes he does get would go back to Labor as preferences over the Liberals.,melbourne,deljswt,4,t5_2qkhb

11278062,0,t1_dfabgfj,Im referring to toilets without urinals. Youll often see them at restaurants and small bars. Theyre literally a small room with a single toilet. No need for gender markings.gtOr go to the disabled toilet which is essentially just a gender neutral toilet thats large enough for disabled people but anyone can use them.Most places with single use toilets dont have disabled toilets. They dont tend to have the room. When available theyre a good choice though.gtUltimately if its an issue for you to have penises out there or if its an issue for those with the penises hanging out for you to be there then clearly you should just go to the female toilets.Right but what if people have an issue with you using the female toilets? Like you see a lot of media coverage in the US and some comments in this thread saying that trans women shouldnt be using the womens bathrooms and instead should use the mens. You get people telling you that its common sense to use bathroom or another but they cant agree on what bathroom you should be using. You have to remember that your view that people should use whichever bathroom theyre most comfortable with is quite a progressive view and theres many conservatives who would disagree with you eg see the laws being passed in the US forcing trans people to use specific bathrooms.A lot of trans people especially early in transition have a fear that theyll be attacked or told that theyre using the wrong toilets. Security has kicked me out of the toilets before. Gender neutral toilets are great because you dont have to worry about any of that. You can just use the toilets in peace do your business and get out of there.,melbourne,dfacoev,4,t5_2qkhb

Its a source of daily entertainment as my tram line frequently has drug addicts and various people with apparent disorders.When I travel however I carry a pack with laptop various bits of equipment and technical gear. None of this is stuff Id want exposed to the elements such as water or potential impact damage as it is all very expensive. Nice as it would be to ride a bike in I have no desire to put myself or my gear at risk to the elements or the behaviour of others on the road irrespective of how they choose to travel.Cars have the simple benefit of being between you and serious harm.

11500811,0,t3_645lu0,Ill try and aim for nuance in this post but I doubt Ill get it.They should not have got away with this. You dont even spit near a cop and expect not to do some jail. You touch a cop and you go down for a long time. If you shoot at a cop you shouldnt expect to see daylight for at least a decade. I always thought that if you shot at a cop the cops automatically stop trying to apprehend you and start trying to end you.Having said that thoughgt Justice Michael Croucher could only sentence on the charges before him. He said The injury caused to Constable Ashmole is about as grave as it gets without being classified as a serious injury.So the cop got shot has  pellets still in his head but it still isnt deemed a serious injury. So the injury wasnt serious. It only got the poor cop six months off. Now thats lucky for him. Im sure his family and himself consider themselves fortunate.Where he hasnt been so fortunate is the backing of the police and the judicial system Ashmore put his life on the line for.Maybe hes in the brotherhood but not the fraternity. Hes not being backed up here is all I know.Finally I think society and the community would say anyone who shoots at a cop should not be on the streets.There was only one ball here and everyone dropped it.,melbourne,dfzm7t9,29,t5_2qkhb

A drunk semi coherent woman sprawled across the footpath at pm on a Monday is above my ability to help. I could see no blood or injuries. So a call to the local cop shop was put in. On the way back I saw the woman lurching up the street and the cops sitting in their car. The police said she refused all offers of help and refused to give her address. So they were just going to watch her for a while then move on. Crying drunk woman was back again today. In the same place doing the same thing.

And they wont be more bikers without better infasturcture.Sure so lets build infrastructure that works for everyone. A great bike only arterial system similar to that raised bike highway or whatever it was called that came up recently maybe its not exactly right but along those lines where its bikes only and then bikes exit for a last mile to get where they are going.Too many cyclists think the only answer is sectioned off bike lanes at the expense of other road users. Sometimes it is the answer but I reckon if people were to look at it with an open mind theyd realise that its probably not even the answer most of the time.gt Most cyclists are not morons and most motorists are not morons eitherTrue but as I said in another post laws are not made to keep the sensible in check.gt I just dont want more barriers to entry for cyclingI can see why you wouldnt and I understand and sympathise to a degree. The problem is there arent enough currently. The barriers should not be onerous to get through but reducing barriers for the sole reason that its a barrier isnt good enough.Having to wear a helmet isnt a barrier.

11776048,0,t3_680cmy,Ive got a degree in compsci and  years exp in web development. It took me  years of working retail before I landed a job in my industry as a junior. Now Ive worked at numerous companies and agencies and while some are better than others on average it all boils down to work is work and I do it for money. Some days I do enjoy what I am working on but I ALWAYS prefer to be doing something else with my time. The unfortunate thing Im facing now is that I think Im burning out in the industry entirely but have no other qualifications or ability to take a pay cut to change careers  go back to school. So even with qualifications and exp it can still suck. The grass may always seem to be greener on the other side but it rarely is. Your job is what you make it.,melbourne,dguunnm,1,t5_2qkhb

11787879,0,t1_dgvrzch,I dont think this path applies for OP here hes clearly looking for a way out whether that be long or short but if hes starting with no real interest in anything getting into a very specific path in I.T might not be the best way to go. Hell just crash and burn and find himself in the same place he was in about  years down the line.,melbourne,dgw71q6,2,t5_2qkhb
11788120,0,t1_dgw1by9,gt If you can break into an industry like software development once you have been working for  years in that industry its so easy to find a new job. There are so many vacancies but so few qualified workers to fill them. Basically you need to separate yourself from others by developing in demandrare skills.Breaking in is the hard part however. I also dont think focusing on rare skills is that worthwhile at least in terms of finding work youre much better off just purely focusing on the most marketable skills. Ive found they either dont even know them or dont care or if they are impressed seeing them they dont make up for inexperience in the skillset they actually use theyll pick someone who has more experience in the given skill over someone who might have some experience with it but also other skills.  ,melbourne,dgw816i,1,t5_2qkhb

11792858,0,t1_dgwjg5l,I just mean in terms of giving it a try without putting too much moneytimeeffort into it. Most places offer courses etc like us but the course might be  so if you dont like it its a bit of a waste of money. Similarly its expensive to get a forge hammer and anvil. Its rare that anyone off the street can come by and have a try at actually forging for only mins. There is basically no barrier to entry in terms of skills etc weve had kids in yo come and do courses and love it and make some great things. ,melbourne,dgwrdmx,2,t5_2qkhb
11799497,0,t3_68cmw7,Etsy or custom. Bohemian and sheath dont tend to go together usually. A sheath is a slim column shaped dress. Quite straight up and down. Boho speaks to me as lace and frills. She might be after something vintage  check Etsy for s wedding dresses. Even late s wedding dresses might be right but they will be more expensive. Or contact Circa Vintage the owner is a friend of mine to arrange an appointment. Hope that helps. If she doesnt want lace or any crazy seams or expensive fabric I might be able to do it? I dont sew for a living but I make stuff.  check my post history for some bits and bobs of what I do. ,melbourne,dgxii3t,7,t5_2qkhb

11802092,0,t3_68e4rj,I am not a lawyer but heres some relevant lawgt ROAD SAFETY ROAD RULES   REG gtgt Keeping clear of police vehicles emergency vehicles enforcement vehicles and escort vehiclesgtgt         If a driver is in the path of an approaching police vehicle emergency vehicle enforcement vehicle or escort vehicle that is displaying a flashing blue red or magenta light whether or not it is also displaying other lights or sounding an alarm the driver must move out of the path of the vehicle as soon as the driver can do so safely.gtgt         This rule applies to the driver despite any other rule of these Rules.So a layperson interpretation of this is that if you are already in the path of the emergency vehicle you need to get out of their way despite any other Rules.Again IANAL so I cant come to your defence in court.,melbourne,dgxt3lc,18,t5_2qkhb
