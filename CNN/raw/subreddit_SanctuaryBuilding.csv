8614654,0,t1_d6hvf3k,I agree on just about everything. One thing to note is that local ordinances about stuff like that usually is a suburban thing. Cities have them too sometimes but rural areas usually dont unless they are an official scenic or historic area.,SanctuaryBuilding,d6ifh02,1,t5_3ftut
9185350,0,t3_564c8j,I think a project like this needs to follow the motto Build it and they will come. You cant plan a move like this over the internet. Theres a huge faith element in moving to something tobeestablished i.e. risk. I think the desire to join is out there but its too much burdenuncertainty for most to be involved in setting up.That said Im still supportive of these projects. Im young and in no circumstance to movejoin something yet. However when Im older Ill set something up with a few close friends and once its up running smoothly Ill invite you all.
