937721,1,t1_chao6ys,gtThen it makes it further questionable when you argue there is male disposability because upper class men use lower class men.Which is what male disposability refers to generally speaking. ,feminismformen,chavhal,1,t5_3172q
1000935,1,t1_chhyomx,People who are feminists can have negative opinions about other feminists who demonstrate sexist attitudes. Just because they are not favorable of those feminists does not make them antifeminist.For someone to denounce an entire movement over one interaction there must clearly be other motivations going on. In a vacuum perhaps you would be right where ones only interaction with feminism was one person who claimed to be feminist and the proceeded to bash men but that certainly is not the case with the backlash against feminism is it?gtMy personal experience is actually that antifeminism rooted in antisexism is more common that antifeminism rooted in sexismI have the opposite experience. gtand the latter kind of antifeminism tends to be common among the more extreme conservatives.Not at all. Liberal media spends just as much time bashing feminism. For example Beyonce Knowles certainly not conservative doesnt agree to feminism Its not because shes antisexism. Shes quite simply in favor of sexism against women.,feminismformen,chi2bkk,0,t5_3172q
1039475,0,t1_chm8tko,gtYou and everyone else citing this statistic as inequality are looking at the statistic the wrong way.It is inequality tho its apparent you clearly not have research the issue from your reply claiming the stats are looked at the wrong way.gtMore women than men going to college? Not a big deal. Its a win for women and nowhere near a loss for men.Until you realize suicide poverty incarceration homeless are all up for men and how industrial jobs are down while service jobs are up.  Then you see men are losing big here.  This is besides the economic harm with having men less college educated and that matter high school educated.  And that it helping push lower marriage and that birth rates but I guess heading towards what Japan and Italy are in is totally awesome.gtIn fact the rate of men attending college has increased over the decades too.Half right.  More men have gone back to school.  But men fresh from high school have decline in going to college.  Tho I wager this to you is a non issue. gtthere is more pressure on them to do so in order to prove their worth in society.Wrong.  Women have more freedom in society than men do in western nations.  Least going by the US women are far more free of their gender roles than that of men.  Women arent forced to prove their worth in society like that men are.gtPlenty of work that is socially acceptable for men to do that doesnt require a college degree. I live in computer infested silicon valley. Many of my friends who are men do not have college degrees and work in construction. A similar number of my female friends do have degrees but work in education or administrative assistant positions and somehow still earn less.One lovely anecdote there too bad you failed to realize there is a huge decrease in construction work.  And that overall blue collar jobs are down since the recession hit.  Secondly construction is physical labor that often requires trade skills.  An admin assistant requires zero skills to do nor needs a degree..  A fresh high school grad can do that job.  Education wise it depends what they are doing.  As working in the front office of a school as an office clerk doesnt need a degree nor is it skilled work. Why you think an admin assistant should make as much as a construction worker is beyond me.  Tho I have a feeling you are also young and well heavily liberal to say the least if you are saying such a thing.  As the thing is not all jobs hold the same value to an employer.  Nor should they.  Why should a lownon skilled work be paid as much as high skill work?  gtPatriarchy does not include it but it does not exclude it either.Actually it does exclude it as it only looks at gender power nothing else. Socio economic class is not factor into it.  For someone claiming I have lot to learn apparently you have a lot to learn as well.  As you seem to make patriarchy as broad as possible despite there are other lesser known theories of power out there that clearly you dont seem to be aware of.gtLet me guess are you ridiculous for asking this rhetorical question? Yes yes you are.Nope.  It was a real question.  As you said yourself even in places where women are more equal to men have ways to go.  Basically implying what I said.  gtLuckily I dont. Strawman much?Could have fooled me.  And no I dont strawman much.  No needed to here.gtNo one can be more equal. That doesnt make sense at all.Read Animal Farm it do you some good.  gtDemonstrating that something exists is the same as proving it.However I cant prove it to you because you will simply deny it.Yet you demonstratedproved nothing.  And just made opinionated statements with nothing to back them up. ,feminismformen,chmfy99,1,t5_3172q

1863758,0,t1_ckdp4xh,I absolutely disagree with the notion men cant be feminists. Feminism is the struggle for gender equality.

2114509,0,t1_cl8ldv5,gt its telling me Im wrong if I want a girl with similar values as I have in relation to sexual activity thats a joke.If I want to marry a girl who hasnt slept with many men what is wrong with that? There are plenty of men out there looking for experienced women. Where is the sexism in my personal preference regarding who I sleep withThere is a whole fuckload wrong with that.You treat a womans sexual history as A. a value B. A value you have some right to.  What gives you this right? What distinguishes your right to do so to the racists right to discriminate? What distinguishes your views from slut shaming?These ideas you are advocating provide an apt summary of the entire discourse of male ownership of female sexuality and a key pillar of the patriarchal mindset.  In a patriarchy in our patriarchy womens value is decreased by their sexual experiences thus idealizing virginity demeaning women who are not virgins justifying rape by painting a woman as promiscuous sending women to insane asylums for being oversexual as was common practice in the U.S. until the s and executing victims of rape for adultery as is common in Pakistan and Afghanistan today and so on and so forth.You cannot measure the value of a woman through her submitting to your insane desire for her to not have equal access to sexuality as you do. You have no right to either. Period.  A woman is not a stick of gum that is best before it is unwrapped and chewed as church metaphors for the value of virginity tend to go.  To even support this idea reveals a deeply sexist mindset.  There is no debate around this. You cannot advocate a reactionary value and in the same breath claim to be a feminist.  Be a reactionary. No one is stopping you. We can be as monstrous as we want in our value systems in our democracy. Just dont try to justify your reactionary sexist values as feminist or as ethical.  ,feminismformen,cl8llpg,2,t5_3172q

Debate isnt just about convincing another person. Its about understanding the other persons argument as well as you understand your own. Its about truth seeking. You need to understand my argument well enough that you can convince me you understand it.gt Ill give you an example. In Mass Effect  there is a camera angle that focuses on Miranda Lawsons butt.How does focusing on anyones butt further the story of Mass Effect? How is the obligation to have a brothel in a fantasy game further the narrative for a video game? This is the point you seem to fundamentally missing.Its not sexuality thats bad. Heck its not even that occasional gratuitous sexuality thats bad. Its the excessive gratuitous sexual objectification thats bad. I mean we all recognize that cliches are bad for stories. What happens when the cliche is so consistently and broadly applied that we start to believe that its the norm?Feminists dont want to force anyone. They dont want to make rules.  They want people to understand. They want people to broaden their perspective. To recognize that buying into these cliches hurts a certain demographic of our population and more broadly it ends up hurting us all in the long run.,feminismformen,cs0o5w4,16,t5_3172q

4624592,0,t1_ctd1pl3,Unfortuantely because you are a man you have the ability to stop a lot of sexual assault. Because those guys who arent lying in wait in bushes or in an alley but are instead just aggressive entitled bros who dont consider coercing someone into sex as assault? You have a chance to stop them. You have the ability by being educated on rape and abuse towards women to be able to intervene when you see a potentially dangerous situation. As a man your voice is more likely to be respected by the sorts of guys I mentioned. Theyre much more likely to reconsider their actions when someone they identify with i.e. another man or someone who they respect men not women steps up and says Hey this isnt cool.Im sorry if your college course came across as though YOU are the problem.
