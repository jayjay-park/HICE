6348668,0,t3_4279is,one additional thing to add is Heavy Blow and Slow down when they proc also hit as a normal attack so they increase your overall damage. So your hero hits their normal attack and has a X chance to do an additional normal attack along with the debuff.  I cant find the link now to show you and This may have changed but Im pretty sure its still true I tested some time back switching all my characters to slow down crests in Mesa and it trimmed an average of  sec off the finish time running with the same group of  each time,GraftersCC,czb9tzp,1,t5_3abmw

7669494,0,t1_d3dz4jp,It will be a learning period this month but we still get decent rewards for participating anyway. I think what you have said is a good idea we just need to coordinate our going ham.,GraftersCC,d3dz76f,1,t5_3abmw
7766711,0,t1_d3ozf05,Its okay although corrode really needs him to be super high level amp skill as it relies on everything hitting him loads and being able to tank through it. LDscatterDS are useful straight away on SK but once hes devo with corrode amp some LD crests hes able to solo bases with some good fortune.I wouldnt hang onto it if you rolled a LD or spare scatter as theyre probably more useful right now but itll do okay in the meantime. Make sure to stick him on the front row of LBF etc so that hes the main target of everyone. Corrode needs lots of things attacking to activate enough.,GraftersCC,d3p0hv3,2,t5_3abmw
7766800,0,t1_d3ozf05,scatter is always a nice choice to bulk through especially for arena lost battleground. He is a fast hitter so depending what you have on it thats a good choice Id say.,GraftersCC,d3p0ux6,1,t5_3abmw

7881809,0,t3_4mujcu,worked fine on Moldova k target and would have on the k as well but I got a disconnect and it counted as a one flame dropped Santa he got  hits on the main base died treant to revive him and once he was dead again there have only been  bases left.

7956622,0,t1_d4a5or8,I cashed in one dollar from my Google opinions account. How did you earn so much? Must be you living in a different country because Im lucky if I get a questionnaire once every  weeks or so. Used to get them a few times a week when I discovered it in  or ,GraftersCC,d4aeduj,1,t5_3abmw
8039662,0,t1_d4jnicx,Alright fair enough then I see your plan I agree also. These days I dont favor TG at all Ive dropped him and he stays still at his  from being one of my strongest over a year ago. For overall strenght then I agree solid choice! Im feeding my Warlock aswell right now just XP tho hes just  skill. Ive yet not decided where to put my shards right now. I have a chance for a dubble evo or max out a skill right now. Im so jelly of everyone having Aries. Ive yet not to get that darn hero. I just tried to roll for him but no luck! ,GraftersCC,d4jqetd,1,t5_3abmw

8168129,0,t3_4r21lx,I have a feeling some guilds may watch this thread. I was checking on your easies late evening and I think there was only one HBM base left from given ones other ones transformed to classic central forts.,GraftersCC,d4ykdmi,1,t5_3abmw
8239958,0,t3_42qt6d,Hey is there any leftover spots available? Im at around k might and got pretty decent heroes like Ghoulem SK and PD. ,GraftersCC,d57juh4,1,t5_3abmw
8247171,0,t1_d58d6yg,Yeah although I do feel that our top players probably arent that far off LI not sure whether LI would be noticeably easier or whether its more worthwhile to just wait till we can do LI rewards vs difficulty wise.I think the biggest issue well run into is people lacking a required hero e.g you lack Aries Davh lacks ghoul I think etc. Hopefully between us we could get  of the required teams though but wed probably have to wait for the required  to be online so only around boss time most likely and not everyday.Im working towards having any of the teams mentioned in the previous post on this so that I can cover any gaps. Just waiting to get vlad devod e now so I can put the HB towards uncapping everyone else. Should have enough books ish!?! to evo Aries cupid groot to round out my selection so I can fill any slot. Itll be a few weeks before Im there though We definitely cant carry in there though. Even in M losing  team is a fail and without e heroes its pretty much instant death. I suspect for the guild as a whole were a long way off of running LI in place of M.,GraftersCC,d58ga4q,1,t5_3abmw
8265310,0,t1_d5alkul,Oh good old D LOD times I loved Druid!But Im with you here Ive not done much guild mesa for few months now as I cant stay do everything past boss time. Last time I did that it took nearly  mins to complete everything. I pub mine during my day. Honestly its not much of the time waster as people would belive. Sure people leaves when everyone is solid and a go but thats the way of pubs. Tap the names on the leftside and you see all teams heroscore and sneak peak on  guys and if your satisficed gogo ,GraftersCC,d5apz96,1,t5_3abmw

9402867,0,t3_59eogp,My Ghoulem has been working with Skill  and the rest of my skill levels are identical to yours for Position . Most of us put the eye of garuda artifact on Ghoulem since the silence is very important and he does not die and like you we run him with revite crests for the heal and damage reduction right away surviving the drop is the hardest part.We normally have PD with Revit crests with yours double evolved and a Treant I dont think he needs the revive. I run revive crests on Aries PK and Reaper.  Even level  crests are good since there are so many Ghoulems healing.  More often than not my PK needs the revive crest and Treant to last the full time. Right now P seems like your spot. P must have a Dread Drake P must have a Revit  Valentina. P would take some heavy investing to get Treant evolved and skill  then an Ice Demons skill up which probably is not worth it.,GraftersCC,d97vp04,3,t5_3abmw
