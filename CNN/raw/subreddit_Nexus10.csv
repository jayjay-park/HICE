812244,0,t1_cgi3cpi,sorry for the late replyI never had any problems with wifi since I bought it. I rarely use youtube apps or direct browser since I always use PVStari had been using it since  ICS app for that but as far as I remember there are times I too have buffering issues with YT viewing on the YT app. For wifi i usually use n for browsing mmorpg and webtv apps with no problem.,Nexus10,cgwlu4x,1,t5_2uff4

1366823,0,t3_29qsst,The new Galaxy  S with the OLED screen looks REALLY nice I have only had Nexus devices until I got a Galaxy Note Pro . I thought it was going to come with some crappy bloated software but latest Samsung software is actually really good  almost Nexus like I put Nova Launcher on all my devices and since I it on the Samsung I have never missed having root  or a Nexus because I only used it for Power Toggles and Quickboot and Samsung has those features built in its worth a look for sure the  S has been getting rave reviews everywhere ,Nexus10,cinmca8,-1,t5_2uff4

2405338,0,t1_cm8w5ox,Wait so youve tried out the chrome tabs in the Nexus  and they actually work? I even downloaded the Chrome Beta and still dont get the merge tabs option. I was Googling around some more and heard it was only a phone option and not for tablets. ,Nexus10,cm90bb3,1,t5_2uff4
