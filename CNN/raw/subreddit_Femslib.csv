6187452,0,t3_408fij,This is a great article. And one that hits home personally. I have a lot of health issues. I was born with IBS diagnosed at  finally treated at . Turns out a fairly innocuous medication almost eliminates the excruciating and almost daily episodes. Doctors ignored me most of my life and never seemed to believe the pain could be that bad. I had one conversation with a guy on reddit on an old account who was given opiates to help with the painful episodes and couldnt help but feel envy. I had to fight back tears with my most recent GI doctor when I realized he actually believed me. I wasnt being treated like I was making things up. The article also mentions endometriosis another in my issue cocktail haha. That also took years to diagnose not adequately treated until I was  the year of finding good doctors. Once I came to my university clinic doubled over a Milios driver bless his heart had helped me in. I could hardly talk. They scolded me for how much advil Id taken and treated me like I was bluffing. I asked about painkillers and they said no thats not appropriate for menstrual cramps. They told me I needed to try a different birth control method if I was going to act like this and not woman up every time I had a period. Then theres the fact that they lied to me about iud insertion which I considered. They said it felt like a pap smear. I have seen insertions and know it can be extremely painful for many women. They said under no circumstances would they give painkillers after. My current doc one in the long line of gynecologists Ive seen finally acknowledged that. Said shed be willing to partially sedate me during insertion and would prescribe opiates if the cramps afterwards got out of control. She told me there was no reason not to do this and thought other doctors just werent acknowledging the pain insertion could cause. Luckily the shot is working well enough.Then theres my common experience with wisdom tooth removal. I had them out got a head start with pain killers all that. After I ran out I got dry socket badly. I couldnt deal with customers at work cause I was too swollen to speak intelligibly. Then it got painful and I was actually crying not usual for me. It was the weekend so I called the on call dentist. He said there was no way he was giving more painkillers and refused to see me. So I went to urgent care. They accused me of drug seeking and playing up the pain for that purpose and sent me home. This has pretty much been my experience with painkillers every time something like that happens.Its a tricky issue because its hard to prove in individual cases that your gender has to do with being ignored or treated badly. Its great to see numbers come out regarding this. People always tell me I have terrible luck with doctors but it seems far from an anomaly. It makes me wonder if these studies will change the way doctors address women and their painhealth concerns. It would be great to see this issue brought up at conferences or in med school.  ,Femslib,cysy5jr,4,t5_3bk4x
6689053,0,t1_d0a9clz,This is absolutely true in my circle of friends the stud is the only one who doesnt see his behavior as deplorable.  Theres this notion of guys sitting around cheering each other on for misogynistic exploits and while Im sure that does exist places its not exactly commonplace.,Femslib,d0b7g7h,6,t5_3bk4x
