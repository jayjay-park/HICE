6765005,0,t1_czxuz98,The anime will cover all of the rest of book . The manga pacing so far was about  chapters per book and were  chapters into book . Which would mean  more month until it finishes book . Even if we assume optimistic increase in pacing at least an year. By then we may have another season of anime which I am convinced will come theres no reason to stop at book  of  when the anime boosted the book sales by a whopping one million copies since it started airing,gate,d0j3cqd,1,t5_2vw2o

8205418,0,t1_d52jqp9,You have the right of it. Ill give Japan the fact that its basically their place to explore make an impression on etc. but only a certain area not the kit and kaboodle. But I think other countries have the right to observe and make sure everything is on the up and up. Im not like President Donald Im totally NOT an EXPY of G.W.Bush nor a strawman of the worst of American Jingoism! Darrel. I think hes an insulting characature and unlike many shows where its not played seriously this one is actually actually rubs me the wrong way.

8334948,0,t3_4tou00,Itll be a massacre for the gateans lol  if the soldiers just tuckered in their tanks.

Your helmet can survive but can the wearer?Likewise I cant imagine how much shock anyone would get from the sheer volume of AA fire if they cast a shielding layer especially if youre required to cast it at close enough range. And considering the caliber and if its one of those shields that work like an objectcatching net...,gate,db4dx8n,1,t5_2vw2o
10045732,0,t1_dbgp510,Thats a hell of a beast best I can do is give you our side of shit.For starters you cant even apply for it normally our MOS falls under the occupation field of Combat Support. Basically you apply for combat support and trust in fate. Needs of the Corps or somehow getting the right people to put in the right word family friend of ours was a Major in charge of my station will determine if you actually get in.If you get lucky and theres spots open then off your ass goes to Fort Benning Georgia for a three month course. This is of course after three months at Parris islandSan Diego and then a month at MCT.Tank school just brushes you up on basic shit how to operate the tank at a basic level so that youre not useless. You also learn terminology as well as friendly and enemy vehicle identification. You also learn about the weapon systems and how to maintain em blabba blabba.Once thats done off your ass goes to either  Palms California RIP to you or Camp Lejeuene NC Not so bad but kiss your chances of a meaningful relationship goodbye unless youre ready to lower your standards in women. Also have fun being despised in Wilmington or just about anywhere else in NC.Tank training works off a readiness system long as theres two companies that are ready to deploy recent training the big bosses are happy. Second Tanks only has two companies now there used to be four...  What does this mean for you? Expect your ass to be constantly training every other month. If youre lucky you might get to go on the black sea rotation and play spookums with NATO allies in that region or near it.But thats a new thing dunno how long we LL be doing that for. Basically you ll do a month long gunnery once a year where youll take the tanks out and compare dick sizes as crews in a company compete to hone their skills. Shits no joke we train to hit and do it the first time the right time. It will DRAIN your ass.Other training events include little bullshit exercises on base that run for a few days.Theres also DFT though Im pretty sure Black Sea Rotation is the new DFT.All I ever remember about army tankers is that they just dont train as often we do. Gunnery doesnt last as long for them for example.,gate,dbgzgep,1,t5_2vw2o
