635199,0,t1_cgca8tq,First time I pulled the trigger I killed someone with an Ion pistol. It is an amazing nongallante scout killer. Ive also harassed heavies with it but you NEED a place to gtfo to or dont bother against anyone you definitely cant oneshot.That said if you can damage them then run away and have a charge ready for when they round the corner super viable. Ive taken out superior scouts and mediums with that. I have not spent much time using semiauto.No heavies killed yet except one but he was an idiot,subdreddit,cgch0ts,1,t5_2tyox

7463868,0,t1_d2qh2no,I assume your playing DS on the PS whats your characters name in case I run into you? Mine is Malochs Lector and Im doing enough invasions that we might meet.  I second the NIOH endorsement I thought the combat was very rewarding and the loot system was interesting. This is only the alpha yet they have gt different armor sets for you to try out which look a fair bit different. ,subdreddit,d2qlgc1,2,t5_2tyox
