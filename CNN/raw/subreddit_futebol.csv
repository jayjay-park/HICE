1514424,0,t3_2bix3z,Hello there again uoccupythekitchen nice to see you found some time to visit us here at rfutebol.You started a good discussion and didnt forget to mention that we need improvement in the youth categories so wont I.We select youth players Im talking about players that at  years old will take part in the big clubs youth squads in the most inhumane way possible. Whenever a scout is present in a amateur youth match the youth coach managing the team will get a little richer. He will only keep on the field players with sponsored participations. NOT BY ABILITY and DEFINETELY not by intelligence. Brazilian players are all pretty stupid. Few can write and read well for a start.Neymars dad is the example of a man who had to invest a lot of money so his sons talent wouldnt disappear because once a good player turns  his chances are slim to none. And in this scheme we lose MOST of the good players because they will eventually realize it is a fixed game and will invest their time being a different type of professional.We need a full organised college football with players from  years having to play for their universities for at least  years before going professional and we must include a day to draft those players. Big event like americans do.Well educated players make a difference a good difference.Next we need a league managed by the clubs. CBF can keep the seleo for all I care. But the clubs are the main passion here. Globo will continue as the mais sponsor and must have some decision power but the amount of power Globo has was showed on how unstoppable they are by saving Fluminense from relegation NOT  months ago. We had a World Cup  months after saving Fluminense and if Brazil had won it would mean the victory of corruption.TLDR Stop treating youth players as prostitutes and organize a league for professional football.,futebol,cj63ykd,3,t5_2tfgu

2354206,0,t1_cm2np1f,Al Garafa in Qatar told Fifa and presented proof that Atltico Mineiro still owns them M Euros for Tardelli.So yeah Kalil went abroad told everyone he would pay and didnt.At least that is what it seems. He now has  days to do so or Fifa is threatnening removal from their lists  Whether this will have any impact on Conmebol or CBFs competitions it is obscure. ,futebol,cm2ovk7,1,t5_2tfgu

3164055,0,t3_2vtbxa,Im willing to give it a go. I must say I have no mod experience am new to the Brazilian league but have researched it and try to catch streams and am in England and in school. So obviously not ideal mod material. However I enjoy football and am knowledgeable on BPL Championship League  MLS La Liga Serie A Bundesliga and am building my knowledge on the Brasileirao and the A League. I would have an active role in the community and would like moderating experience. ,futebol,copybm8,2,t5_2tfgu
