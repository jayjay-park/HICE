1243019,0,t3_240ist,advice for moving to nica long term.....do your research. Then come down adn check it out and see what you think. Visiting here and living here are two completely different things. Also everyone has very different lifestyles. You can life better than the standard american lifestyle or you can live extremely cheaplow budget. Get an honest idea of what your budget would be like and what kind of person you are and what you can live without. Outside of the main cities is extremely different. Its like night and day between living in San Juan Del Sur and living in a small village in the northern mountains.No advice will be blanket advice as everyone is so different. Nicaragua is certainly not for everyone. Take an honest look at yourself and then come back with more specific questions.,Nicaragua,ci9geiq,1,t5_2qqqz

9949649,0,t3_5hzxz8,I did  days in Ometepe at Little Morgans and loved it. Its a party place though. I think  days is enough there. We hiked Conception one day and motorbiked around the islands the other. Remember to go to Corn is an adventure. Its a lot of travel time to get there and back so youd really only have a day or two to enjoy it. Heard its amazing though. My top  places I went were Ometepe Leon and SJDS. Close behind is the treehouse south of Granada. Damn I want to go back just writing this. ,Nicaragua,db4gr2a,2,t5_2qqqz
