3704831,0,t1_cqekir2,you have oily skin but with make up your skin looks too dry? Im just trying to clarify because I was getting a bit confused. haha if thats the case you could try to use a dewy setting spray. NYX makes a great one and its pretty inexpensive. are you using any powders on your face? and how long before you apply make up do you apply the moisturizer?,MakeupEducation,cqekqbi,1,t5_37pce
3705150,0,t3_32tht9,Hi! Do you have any tips for contouring on pale skin with not so prominent cheekbones? I Think I have placement down because I love the look when I look at my face from the front but everything I try looks orange. ,MakeupEducation,cqem1gg,2,t5_37pce

3779910,0,t3_33oqq4,Ive been really impressed with Maybellines DefineALash mascara!  But if you could order from Sephora.com they have their annual mascara sampler for only USD sorry I dont know what it is for Canadians!!  According to their website its A sampler set with five of our bestloved deluxe mascaras and an enclosed voucher so you can redeem your favorite in the full size.  And in my experience those deluxe samples of mascara are perfect.  Ive actually been using those for the past year and I have  on ice lol. ,MakeupEducation,cqn4y1e,3,t5_37pce

4613783,0,t3_3dzoay,Oh my goodness. How could I forget Rae Morrison. She only has a handful of videos but they are the definition of quality over quantity. there is this one smokey eye tutorial that goes through the full face and is pure gold. Its supposed to be for an eye look but the whole video is loaded with gems for other makeup application. ,MakeupEducation,ctc5bt5,1,t5_37pce

4686269,0,t3_3ej5uw,I think bronzer looks most natural when its matte. You can add a highlight if you need to. But if youre contouring on trying to look tanner than you are go shimmerless. I tend to use it more in the cooler months because I get really pale but only on my face dont know what thats about. ,MakeupEducation,ctl8z92,1,t5_37pce
5242020,0,t1_cvhuj14,I think filling your brows in with a pencil first helps to get the shape down and then setting that with a powder so it stays all day. Make sure its not too dark though otherwise youll end up with the sharpie brow thing going. Hopefully this video will help also! video,MakeupEducation,cvhuq34,2,t5_37pce

8107788,0,t3_4q56m7,You really just need to experiment. Like buy a bold color or a nude color lip and rock that one day. Try a winged eyeliner. Try a highlighter. Youll find your way!,MakeupEducation,d4rdzch,4,t5_37pce

10650650,0,t3_5semsx,Definitely xpost this to rmakeupaddiction as its a more active sub. And it would probably also help to include a couple pictures of your face with no makeup or with your everyday base. I would probably recommend different things based on what your face actually looks like but to start I would say to practice using darker colors for blush and lips.  ,MakeupEducation,ddej6gn,2,t5_37pce
11538332,0,t3_64m5ku,upurebredginger did an amazing explanation on foundation. If you have dry skin I recommend the Too Faced born this way foundation. If you have oily skin I suggest the Urban Decay AllNighter? foundation. If you wanted to fill in your eyebrows I would suggest getting an eyebrow powder for natural looking filled in eyebrows and go for the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow powder duo and use an eyebrow brush and a spoolie. I use their brush  personally. Or you could also go for their brow wiz or their brow definer theyre just eyebrow pencils. The brow definer is triangular shaped which makes it a lot easier filling in brows but the brow wiz is a little smaller and has a more defined point. I also use their brow wiz just to make more natural looking hair like strokes. I would suggest in maybe getting a blush as well just to put some color on your cheeks. Tarte makes really nice blushes but I use a Too Faced blush. Just apply it to the apples of your cheeks with a big fluffy brush I use a powder brush for this honestly! If youre interested there are plenty of makeup brush kits all over the place whether it be Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada Walmart or Sephora. I think its a great investment because you have a lot of the brushes you would use either right now or later on once you feel like putting more makeup on!  that and they come with a bag to put them in or to put just your basics in. Theres contouring and bronzers and highlights and color correcting and a bunch of other stuff too but the basics are really just foundation powder eyebrows eyelashes and blush. I would suggest a highlighter next for when youre ready to take the next step! ABH highlighters are amazing esp their glow kits. Those you would just put on top of your cheekbones. Id say back off from countouring and color correcting unless your red spots really give you a problem. Then Id suggest just getting single color correcting applicator just for the redness. Put it on top of the red spots and blend it in before you do your foundation and youre good to go!  Otherwise thats pretty much it!! Good luck and have fun If youre looking for a drugstore brand btw I would suggest NYX or Maybelline. But from Sephora Id say ABH for eyebrows and people like benefit cosmetics as well. I still prefer ABH though. UD or Too Faced for foundation and Tarte or Too Faced for blush. Of course its up to you but those are my recommendations. ,MakeupEducation,dg3veqr,3,t5_37pce
