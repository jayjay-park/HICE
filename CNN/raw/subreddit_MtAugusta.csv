I just dont feel satisfied that Im communicating clearly if I dont have a wall of text before me.I have to agree with you that Im being irrational in doing this to an extent. I am trying to honor a criminal. It feels wrong to me in some regards. Still though he was my friend and I feel that the good he did should be recognized with something a little nicer than the griefed out crater that was there before. I guess well have to agree to disagree on that front. At least most of you live far away from his old house so you wont have to see it often. I did not enjoy having a grief just up the road from my house though. Next time he strikes Id be glad to help clean up though. Ive fought more fires and rebuilt more houses in MA than any reasonable person would. Ive no issue with battling a couple more.And yeah he was a dick.

3216256,0,t1_cov386n,Just noticed that.  Okay so I was going to build off the east side of the road and connect via an underground walkway but Dan says go ahead and just plop it right above the nether factory.  NF is at Y Station probably right around Y or so whatever track level is.  Im thinking approx NE  NW  SW  SE  Station Length is approx  blocksWidth is approx  blocksHeight is right around isheither  on length or width to accomodate a station lobby with elevators drop pit and stairs.  Dan also suggested the possibility of adding a shop or two to the station building.  Might be a worthwhile idea.  Someone could make some money selling nether necessities that people might have accidentially left at home.  Itll save them the walkride back.  That would be another  blocks.Im willing to do the tedious work of excavating the station hall.  Im thinking.  About starting at Y and building and fortifying the walls as I dig down so Itll be easier to reach.  Ill use dirt towers to put in the netherstone pillars and the lights.I do have a question for you though.  I usually put my tracks right next to each other but I see the logic in putting them  block apart in the tunnle because it requiers less redstone when you put torches inbetween the two lines.  Do you think its better to seperate them by a block in the staion as well?  I dont know how it would impact the asthetics but Im thinking usability here.  I think theyre probably fine being next to each other in station but are we going to run into PVP issus with people flailing their swords out of their cart while they roll by each other. PIll probably be on around  Eastern the next few days they have me working the late shift. ,MtAugusta,covd7uq,1,t5_2u6on

And also the second thoths fucks up once you put a d bounty on thoths someone that helped you so much and allowed to you get akhibara and things like that he fucks up once and you instantly backstab him.

3483252,0,t1_cpp3xt6,This is where my thoughts have gone yes. I like the idea of gt not fixing the number of council membersI hadnt thought of that but it makes a lot of sense. There would be a challenge to construct the right legal enforceable phrasing that would allow such expansion and contraction elegantly how do you decide who falls off the council for instance?gt Perhaps the authority to set public policy should be given to the council and the mayor with general voting only being used to elect officials?A referendum system might work citizens can propose and vote on bills that MUST be considered by the council if a majority approves the referendum. The council would be under no obligation to pass it but it would provide a nice way for important social issues that the council isnt aware of to gain public force.gt Under this system Id propose abolishing the existing criminal code and drastically altering the judicial system with the council being responsible for resolving disputes and sentencing criminals on a casebycase basis.One of the things that truly separates Mount Augusta from  of the other cities on the server is we actually have a criminal code and system of laws to begin with. Its truly rare. Its also one of the reasons Ive stuck around working inside a legal framework to improve it is far better than having none and dealing with the conflicting personalities and ambiguities of justice and loss of due process that result. Id be perfectly content with constructing a better criminal code one that gave significantly more flexibility in growing itself so to speak that established a formal civil court for issues like assault and petty theft to allow quick resolution of these issues without involving the larger courttrial process that allowed judges or Councillors the latitude they needed to augment the criminal code as part of their summary judgments to better adapt to changing times and crimes without having their hands tied by lack of explicit entries in the code. But in all those things it must be codified with clear limits on expansion and clear guidelines for overall sentencing so that the rule of law is never in doubt and that Justice can be best applied with impartiality rather than whim.Overall good suggestions. Id love to see a draft constitution illustrating this structure fleshed out. Let me know ifhow I can help.,MtAugusta,cppbdwu,1,t5_2u6on

Itll also be hard to prove whodonit so to speak. There was an incident however just before I became mayor that I had in mind but couldnt figure out exactly how to define a citizen put a TNT trap in front of another citizens door as part of a ruse it misfired and injured an innocent third party. Fortunately the harm was minimal but there was no clear path for prosecution so the case was never followed up on.

3844309,0,t1_cquandw,This is a good reply and I would like to take the time to rebut it.You are correct the stated reason for keeping universal resolutions is that they were the best substitute for unanimity. Several nations not just Mt. A have taken issue with the universal resolutions. Personally I do not think they are a good idea and go against the spirit of the Charter but they were a compromise measure taken to give some strength to the General Assembly. I may have overstated my case when I made the comment about nations leaving. It is said explicitly in the Charter that nations can leave at any time. Some member nations in the future may pursue unilateral actions against leaving nations but the UN itself cannot control their actions. It is very possible that the alliances from the rest of the server spill into the UN. We almost expect it to happen if or when more nations join. To a degree we want the alliances to spill over to the other subreddit. Instead of being more of the same I think that by moving into a more heavily moderated space the two sides will have more restrained discussions. I also think that they will find common ground in nonmilitary ventures. I disagree with your rebuttal of ladez. One of the first resolutions which will probably be a universal resolution will concern subreddit moderation. I do not think that it has been written yet but I believe that it will ban memeing ban foul language and ban multimedia elements. These efforts of moderation will cause the UN subreddit to be a more professional space free of the detritus that collects in the main subreddit.To address your last point and I think I have seen this mentioned before the UN is not an alliance. Unless an universal resolution was passed that declared war something which is very unlikely to ever occur given the global scale of the UN Mt. A would never need to fight or even supply UN actions.,MtAugusta,cquhh9f,2,t5_2u6on
