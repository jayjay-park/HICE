53095,1,t1_cekgwcu,Wait are you seriously comparing the USA with Ukraine? Let me tell you something America is the best example of a new nation that saw its inception through convergence of people from different national backgrounds. It officially exists since  which makes it an infant compared to Ukraines adult age. Still think it is reasonable to compare it to Ukraine which existed for a lot larger period of time? Furthermore it does have official or national language  English! The fact that forms are offered in different languages is a gesture of its effort to coexist and the rapidly increasing amounts of immigrants. I do not know if each person that lives in Ukraine is Ukrainian but if that person holds Ukrainian nationality it better speak the language. Many countries oblige a language course before you can apply for a national passport. For example I had to follow Dutch lessons for a year when I came to live here in the Netherlands and I am not even its citizen!,ukraine,cekh3y5,2,t5_2qqcn

160216,0,t1_cewoeng,I dont disagree with you entirely but what you have to understand is that most people arent especially intelligent. Not to say theyre stupid but their ability for abstract thought isnt the strongest out there. In America you are given some opportunites that other countries dont have. What you dont address and admittedly I didnt either is the lack of industry in this country. Historically human society has had three classes working middle and upper. The working class these days are referred to as blue collar. How many of those jobs have been moving to other countries? Not only that but combined with the emphasis placed on a University degree contrasted with the deemphasis on industrial or trade level professions we are left with a populace without a foundation that being the working class. And as far as poverty goes. It isnt quite as simple as being employed. Did you know that it is literaly impossible to make a living wage off of one minimum wage job? That is an absurd notion if you take in to mind the goal of a minimum wage which is to provide a living wage to the unskilled workers of the work place. Granted simply raising minimum wage wont fix this issue but Jesus lumping everyone who isnt working in to a group of derelicts and vagabonds is not only irresponsible but foolish.Im not sitting here saying the US is an awful place.

306448,0,t1_cfc92ui,First of all buddy the phrase you were thinking of prostiyi lyudi is better translated as common man than simple people that is unless you were intentionally trying to be condescending which would be in line with your imperialist attitude.Second let me congratulate Putin on replacing Homo Soveticus with Homo Putinicus people like yourself who are willfully irrational imperialistic suspicious of the world outside of Russia willing to turn yourselves into serfs by overlooking the misbehavior of your oligarch and mafia overlords and willing to rationalize your overlords systematic erosion of human rights in Russia. If the Russian people want that Im not sure most of them do they could at least leave Ukraine out of it.You dont even try to argue that Russias system works well you dont say a word to address the facts that Russia is ruled by a corrupt elite or that it has an imperialist attitude toward its neighbors which benefits only itself. Whereas the other posters in this thread have presented facts you present beliefs and dogma. Youre willing to settle for the lesser of two evils. Come on  if theyre paying you you should do better than that if youre actually putting forth this garbage willingly you should at least want to front some better arguments but you dont even have the willpower to do that. Homo Putinicus in action.If you want examples of corruption lets take the most recent one from RussiaMost reasonable sources claim that more or less half of the money spent on Putins Olympics has been embezzled. This embezzlement was done by Putins buddies who were awarded their contracts without bids. This is what the money that was actually spent on facilities got youRussian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak attempted to defend the state of the facilities by saying that cameras have shown people leaving their water running all daySo the fruits of corruption are defended by a violation of peoples privacy i.e. a human rights violation. We could go through plenty more examples of Kremlins corruption and human rights violations but whats the point? Westerners and Russians are all aware of this stuff. Sure the West is far from perfect but we have mechanisms to address corruption  youve got a system designed to facilitate it. As long as people like you keep defending it its not going to get any better for you.Take a look at how Poland has done since its Russian adventure. It has a far better standard of living for the common man than Putins Russia does which would have an even lower standard of living than it does at present if not for its oilbased economy and definitely has more respect for human rights. Thats probably the best projection for how Ukraine would be doing if it encountered only minimal Kremlin interference for the same span of time. Any reasonable person would rather live in Poland than Putins Russia thats for sure.,ukraine,cfcj4hx,4,t5_2qqcn

I dont think he will be an instant fix Ukraine has too many problems for that but years and years of hard and HONEST work can change and turn my country around.

I know the idea of police beating the poor innocent students sounds like a great reason to shoot riot police dead but this protests was not grassroots it was started by a very famous journalist. Im sure there were students as there were plumbers and miners etc. Berkut NEVER used lethal force. And while they never used lethal force live rounds were being fired from the protest side along with metal balls flying out of slingshots and cocktails molotov. The fire power of the protesters kept growing and escalating while the Berkut was still equipped with the same rubber sticks. gt And actually normal democratic systems have the notion of selfdefence whether against a cop or not. He slaps you you slap him he shoots you shoot. Cop or no cop. You defend yourself.Well Berkut slapped and you shoot them not slapped them. Thats the problem. And it was you who were breaking the law occupying the main square of the capital of Ukraine. gt Id like to see what youd do if you were being shot at by a sniper while helping your friend out of the line of fire.You cant talk about the sniper fire and ignore the past the cocktails live fire etc. And we are yet to know who was really firing those snipers. Things are getting darker on the Maidan side...gt You just said fascist I thought it usually followed by nazi bendera something about evil IMF and NATO? maybe a bit of capitalism thrown in the mix?Im sorry are there certain words and certain subjects that must be debated whenever a certain word is written?

10258716,1,t1_dc6um4h,Why?As I understand the Minsk agreement it means more control for the regions. So also more control for the regions with more russian population people with russian identity. That will serve russian security interests as in no USNATO expansion closer to Moscow.Else I do not think Russia is interested in conflict at all.So who else needs a frozen conflict? The only one getting something out of this conflict. Dividing Ukraine from Russia and dividing Europa from Russia  is the USA. That is good old imperialist divide et impera. I do not understand why Ukraine like to pay for that.With giving some self determination to the Russia friendly parts of the country Ukraine will also restoring some of the balance after the  western revolutioncoup.

As someone who lived in Ukraine until  compared to the UkraineRomania dispute of the Snake Island the Tuzla island dispute was not perceived as something that shaped RussiaUkraine relations in any way. I dont really remember any major conflicts between Russia and Ukraine at the time not even after  when Ukraine allegedly shot a civilian plane with Russian passengers on board.As for the gas wars  they only started around  which was post Orange Revolution.Also I disagree with the statement that the post Russia has much influence on peoples minds. At least I didnt experience much influence myself and Im from Eastern Ukraine. It was mostly the common postUSSR sentiments that continued to hold Russia and Ukraine close together. Also even before the Orange Revolution there was a strong movement in Ukraine towards the socalled ukrainization. So the Orange Revolution did not produce any shift but merely accelerated the process.,ukraine,dgtos3m,1,t5_2qqcn
